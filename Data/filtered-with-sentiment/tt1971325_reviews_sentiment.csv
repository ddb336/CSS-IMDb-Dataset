" Coulda / shoulda been better
",0.4404,-0.4428,2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Great world-building. Good acting, even the robots were great actors, and made the audience care. But there was too much that was never explained, like who were the two kids who showed up to kill the doctor and Jacq? And why in God's name did that insurance company think Jacq was responsible for the robots' upgrades? Ludicrous! Meek, mild mannered insurance adjuster upgrading robots to end humanity? And surely there was a more age-appropriate person to play the main protagonist? He seemed so old and tired compared to his wife."
" Suspenseful & surprisingly philosphical
",0.296,0.9788,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"... in a lean, mean dystopian atmosphere.This movie breaks little new ground but it's a solid entry in the human-robot interface with one or two neat tweaks on the Asimovian protocols. It's not a high-action flick although there's a not-shabby body count.The robots are simple but surprisingly alive.It's a 1-man show carried by Banderas, who does a creditable job as the Everyman caught up in forces beyond his ken. The script is solid in that sense although other characters seem more set-dressing than human.Don't bother with the Bechdel Test. The few women are useful to the hero & then, typically, discarded one way or another once their plot purpose is served.A very interesting way to pass a Saturday night, with some ponderings to last you through Sunday morning."

" Sci-Fi Movie Soup - Leftovers Tossed in a Pot
",0.0,0.7974,2020-11-22 00:00:00,4,"This started out derivative and uninspired - Blade Runner without the interesting characters. Let's go through the sci-fi movie clich√©s:Drab clothing: check.
Climate disaster: check.
Red-light zone (sorta'): check.
Prostitute with a heart of aluminum alloy: check.
Evil corporation: check.
Evil head of corporation: check.
Evil henchmen: check.
Baby: check.Once this got past being derivative it got a little silly. Then a little sillier. Then kind of dumb. Then pretty darned stupid.It was generally photographed well, so there's that. In terms of story it was all fairly predictable, although there was one scene of just a few seconds that caught me off-guard and earned one thumb up for the filmmakers. I won't mention it even though it's ultimately not a spoiler.It's not the worst science fiction I've seen, but it's far from the best. If the filmmakers had just thrown in a bit more creativity to break out of the box I could possibly applaud them, but that didn't happen."
" Poor writing and stupid charachters drag this film down a lot.
",-0.8126,0.4019,2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,Visually its entertaining. Recycled storyline. Banderas charachter is quite dim. So many ways to better his situation and instead the writers opted for hysterics. Just a rather disappointing film that looks way better than it actually is.
" Should Robots Sel-Repair?
",0.0,0.9949,2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,"I first heard about this film when I was sitting in one of my Computer Theory classes, and the lecturer decided to use the cover of this film to introduce a topic (Push Down Automata), and of course he had altered the title somewhat. Mind you, I suspect that this probably went over most people's heads namely because it isn't one of those well known films, though I suspect it is on his list of favourites (with his all time favourite being Blade Runner).Actually, mentioning Blade Runner I should point out that there are similarities with this film, but there are also similarities with I, Robot, though I suspect that Asimov would probably prefer this film above and beyond the one that they ended up releasing (despite the fact that I did quite like it). The reason that it is connected with I, Robot is because the robots in this film have two laws that are hardwired into their system, namely that they cannot harm, or allow to come to harm, a human being. However, that is where the similarity ends because the second law is that they are not allowed to alter themselves. So, as it turns out this film seems to hinge on the fact that robots have suddenly learnt how to alter themselves, which the film says has the potential to open up a whole can of worms.However, I guess the other thing with its connection to Blade Runner is that while Blade Runner is wet and dark, this film is quite bright, and set mostly in a desert. The reason for this is due to solar storms that completely devastated the Earth and knocked society back significantly. Yet, I found it a little odd that they were able to build robots, but I suspect that has something to do with a majority of the population being killed, so robots were developed to help with the manual labour. As such, the world certainly does seem like a different place, especially since humanity is clustered in scattered cities, and there simply does not seem to be much in the way of food or water.I guess this is another one of the films that expores the modern question of to what extent computers can become too powerful. The idea here is that if robots are able to modify themselves then their ability to give themselves upgrades will simply result in them become ever more powerful, and of course eventually being able to override the first law. This is the main focus of the film, and that is robots fixing themselves, which is something that didn't seem to be explored in Asimov.The film is rather slow going, but I guess this is the same with Blade Runner as both films are exploring ideas. In a way both of them look at the idea of robots evolving beyond simply being mechanical humans, and actually taking a life of their own. In Blade Runner it was the desire to extend their lives, and this is sort of similar here, though it seems to be more focused on the idea of self repair. But that does go further because self repair also goes to repairing other robots, which in turn leads to modifying them, and finally building new ones, ones no doubt that evade the laws that have been programmed into them.Of course, there is always the explanation that these laws are hardwired into them, and that they simply cannot be overwritten. Yet, as the film suggests, this is not some much a problem, especially since if hardware is developed that evades these laws, and the components can be swapped out. Interestingly the main robot that is the focus of the film starts off as a sex robot, but when given this new device advances beyond what the original programming demonstrated.I do have to say that I did quite like the robots in this film. They certainly did have something about them that I warmed to. In a way it felt as if they were a new, innocent, life form that was on the cusp of evolving into something more. Also, I did feel that the film did end well, though in one sense it also reminded me somewhat of Blade Runner, namely that there just seemed to be unanswered questions. Look, in the end it is pretty good film, especially if you like the style, and the theme, or Blade Runner (and similar films)."

I don't even know which was worse; the non-acting by secondary characters.... one of whom did not seem to actually remember her lines, the offensive and pointlessly suggestive graphics, or the fact they managed to make an exciting concept boring. I'm not just a raving, dumb guy. I'm a fan of films in general and of science fiction films in general...both thought provoking and imaginative ones, as well as well fun and exciting ones...but not of this one. I've come to suspect I should be more careful about choosing movies where the lead produces his own role, as is the case here."

Yes, it is visually stunning, but in this day and age of nothing but superhero movies and redo's of movies from the 80's this stands out as one of the best movies in quite sometime. To understand the dichotomy between this film and what is really happening with our present technological hunger to create AI is quite frightening."
" At least the robots don't look exactly like humans...
",-0.2755,-0.7347,2020-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Not really too sure what to make of this flick. I watched it on the Netflix sci fi movie list and it had good production values plus the effects weren't too bad at all. The main character had the weirdest role ever - Blade Runner without the gun and the authority to go with it.Robots follow Asimov's 2 laws of robotics in this flick (instead of the usual 3). They were built by a robotics corporation who knew their constructs would, for some reason, transcend into higher lifeforms/god/UrSkeks (Dark Crystal ha!). They hire various Mafia goons, mooks and street kids to do their dirty work for them, blowing away humans who have access to/seen/heard of a God Robot data/microchip/circuit motherboard thing that will make the robots evolve.Some robots run away and plod slowly through the desert for a hundred miles. I thought they were heading for a robot utopia but no, just some garage in the middle of nowhere. Stuff happens. The mafia thugs with shotguns chase after them and gleefully put holes through humans and robots galore. Apparently these humans are the selected survivors of a natural holocaust. What you see are beggars and homeless humans getting shot through the head by other humans with guns.At no real point were robots treated badly... well at least no more badly than the humans. Robots talk about stuff that robots shouldn't know anything about (living and surviving). A doctor is killed by a street kid with a gun because she talked too much about robots learning stuff that took humans hundreds of thousands of years to learn.By the end of the flick I still wasn't convinced that the robots were ascending into higher life forms, far surpassing the entirety of human evolution. Except for that weird little robo-dog-insect thing. It was kinda cute, in a creepy, adorable way. Mmmkay."
" Spanish blade runner?
",0.0,0.9771,2020-01-17 00:00:00,5,"As a big fan of dystopian Sci-Fi joints like Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell I was pretty excited to see this movie as it seemed quite promising.
Overall I liked the story and the look of this movie very much. The directing reminded me a bit of the Asian-slow-paced story telling approach, which I don't mind at all.
It features some nice camera work with a well done near-future Setting of a dystopian Earth. Which I think was pretty realistically looking even though it wasn't as appealing to me visually as Blade Runner. Maybe it's because the Automata world seems a little bit more to the ground and not all spaced out.
Overall it's a good movie and definitely one for every Sci-fi fan.
I missed a bit more character development it felt a bit like there was a lack of characters that are worth remembering. But maybe it was a active decision to make the viewer focus on the storyline more than the performance of single actors.6/10 good idea that could been executed better"
" The day we will become obsolete.

It's an entertaining sci-fi, with good cinematography, believable futuristic landscapes, and a good cast. Antonio Banderas never disappoints with his acting. He's just a good actor that deserves to be in good movies. Aut√≥mata might not be well known to the public but it should, certainly if you like post apocalyptic stories."

" Seen it all before
",0.0,0.8625,2019-07-17 00:00:00,4,"AUTOMATA is another disappointing addition to the robots-run-amok cycle of films which have been pumped out relentlessly since I, ROBOT and SURROGATES back in the 2000s. These all feature similar-looking robots breaking down and killing people, which is against the laws of robotic programming. It takes something special for such a film to stand out, but AUTOMATA isn't that film. Instead it's a gloomy, slow-paced police procedural-type thriller with a few half-hearted action scenes amid the recycled plot ideas. Poor old Antonio Banderas does his best and is supported by some interesting actors in support, but the story never takes off and ends up climaxing in the most predictable way imaginable. The CGI effects used to animate the robots is pretty decent but I'd have preferred a more engrossing story with worse effects."

It's a movie about AI and consciousness, after all.Nevertheless, it's beautiful. A lot of the shots are beautiful, the concept is beautiful. The atmosphere is impressive, it's a blend of Blade Runner and Asimov's Robots books.But I expected more. In the end, this is not a real SF, there's nothing that raises questions. It's only a pretentious film, with shallow themes about humanity, family and consciousness which are not even explored, just mentioned.It's not a waste of time if you're looking for the feeling of Blade Runner, just don't expect an interesting story or philosophical dilemmas."

It's one of the best films I've ever seen!It was the only possible competitor to the immortal Blade Runner, far better than the Blade Runner sequel and explored a significantly more plausible future with deft elision of dystopian details while still transmitting the despair of the world depicted.I'm an microbudget filmmaker myself, and I immediately pegged the layered performances and script from the beginning as something to study for myself.Minor spoilers:
Many scenes suggested fascinating cosmic conundrums such as the need for, and the early stages of, the formation of religion (when the robots at the outpost are trying to build a more advanced robot), the issue of fathoming the nature of one's own creation.One of the best features is the astonishing locations which mesh perfectly with the dreary problems suggested by the script. The fact that the film is humble and only cost 15 million while having far more immediate emotional content than the bombastic Marvel movies just made me more impressed. It was like meeting a beautiful girl who isn't snobby or standoffish about her beauty.Absolutely loved it. No more complex than it needed to be, sympathetic to all involved, clear concepts and plot, minimal violence and bombast.Best of all, only about 5 second of f(*&(*ing car chase."
" A Rich Robotic Sci Fi Movie
",0.5574,0.9686,2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"11 July 2015. Finally, robotic movies are beginning to evolve into the technological mainstream. As with Eva (2011), the maturing of films with a robotic theme are now expressing the seamless, but uncertain relationship that robots may garner in the near future. Until now, robots have been portrayed as curiosities on film instead of integrated with humans. With echoes from the atmospheric Blade Runner (1982), the desolation of Cherry 2000 (1987), Automata offers a rich speculative vision of humans and robots, as Antonio Banderas portrays a Blade Runner like a struggling public official seeking out a mystery regarding artificial life creations. The robots in Automata seem very authentic without frills and the Antonio Banderas plays a rather insensitive protagonist to great effect. This movie relies more on the fascinating interface between human and machine rather than action and stylistic drama, a plot driven story about the next phase of technology. In a way, this is a non-action, dramatic, machine version of Planet of the Apes (1968)."

" TO SERVE AND PROTECT

They live in walled in cities to protect themselves from the encroaching desert and radiation. Robots, that look like crash test dummies, have assumed many human duties. They have 2 protocols. The first is never to harm a human. The second is that they can not alter another robot. Shades of ""I Robot.""It appears the robots are made from recycled parts. People in the dump outside the city are fair game to be shot. Society appears to be two tiered. There doesn't appear to be much of a government, but there is a police force. Insurance still exists and Jack Vaucan (Antonio Banderas) is an insurance agent/adjustor/ investigator. Communications is sporadic and there are nude holograms dancing around the city, something that was never explained. The cities are dying, i.e. they have ""expiration dates.""As in ""I, Robot"" the protocols are broken as robots are discovered repairing themselves and stealing items. Jack with a pregnant wife (Birgitte Hjort S√∏rensen) is investigating what the insurance company and manufacturers say is impossible. He soon finds out from Melanie Griffith that the ""monkey has come down from the tree.""The film starts out as an interesting science fiction mystery/thriller. We struggle with Jack to discover what is going on. However once we discover what is actually happening, the film fails to create that initial interest and you wait for it to pick up. It ends rather odd on a down note. Okay for me-too science fiction. 3 1/2 starsParental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex. Background hologram nudity."

What holds it back though is story writing full of plot holes that doesn't make any sense when you think of it. Which is a shame because this movie actually had the potential to become so much more.
Because of the emotional impact it still manages to make, I would still recommend it for lovers of the scifi genre though, although I doubt it will become the after-the-fact, Blade Runner-like cult classic it was aiming to be."

Robots tooooooo slow, like 1970's cyborgs.
The film itself also too slow.
I like slow movies, but this should not have to like this.Understood the point of the face off movement when the robot get own id, remove the human face, what they dont really need.Also good reference on cockroaches when robots are make one as the stronges surviver on this planet.
But that robot seems lame, slow minded and cant protect itself uick enough.In AI point of view they not that intelligent as they must to be as this film talk about.
Problem solving should be in high level but those robots only repair themselves quick, but no more. No speed up, no survive, or protection. That is low intelligence, not high.Holographic adverts in the city... O dont understand that at all. Ghost in the shell reference? But why? In that stge of this city does not need that.Dumped robots like homeless, I cant see the point. Why nobody fix them or recycle? 
I got it, probably try to refer our dumping culture nowadays, our machines is going to dump even if still in working order. Tools, televisions, cars, computers. But all turned off by the way. So I cant see the point robots still half alive."

It's definitely a bit slow-going and could have been sharpened up some, although I'm certain that it plays the way the director intended. Melanie Griffith couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, and it's even worse now that all of that plastic surgery has rendered her face immobile--it's really quite a sad situation. Antonio Banderas is his usual overwrought, melodramatic, brooding self, which just gets to be annoying after a while. Still, it's a thinking person's movie, which in this day and age of special effects driven plots, is a very good thing. Thus, even with some reservations about the acting and the slow pace, I'm giving it a solid 6 stars, and considering that maybe I should have given it 7 instead."

It questions our right to rule, what it is to be human, robot sentience and ""The Meaning of Life"" itself. Where I Robot and Bicentennial Man are slick and glossy, this movie is the exact opposite. Dirty, dark and rough around the edges. It's gritty, engaging intellectually and emotionally satisfying. I'll leave other reviewers to go over the plot, but my advice is to bring out a large glass of whisky, sit down in a comfy chair and enjoy a movie that is very different to most and a reminder of what good writing and acting can accomplish."

Could an artificial ""life""-form one day develop something like consciousness and an own personality!? I enjoyed the movie really and I liked Antonio Banderas in this movie a lot. Compared with Blade Runner 2049 Automata is imho the better and more interesting movie, even if the production level cannot compete with the sequel of Blade Runner.

" Apparently underrated because of misunderstanding
",-0.4215,0.9663,2018-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I noticed that many reviewers associated this film with ""Blade Runner"" and ""I,Robot"". Some similarity in the image of the future and of the robots really exists here. But in fact it's not important at all for this film. The concept and the story of this film are far original than the visual effects. The title ""Automata"" means mechanical dolls mainly made for fun, to entertain the privileged in Europe when democratic system was unimaginable. ""Robot"" is neologism made by the Czech writer Karel Capek in his play ""R.U.R.""'(1920), where artificial human-like machines are use all over the world as universal and cheap labor forces. In the play (and in all the films with ""robots"" borrowing its concept from Capek's play) ""robots"" are like slaves, tend to overthrow the human control,want to be free, so their violence against human makes a dramatic turning point in those films. By removing all ""scientific"" details, their plot will not so much different from that of Eisenstein's ""Strike"" (or Griffith's ""The Birth of Nation"" if seen from ""masters' point of view""). 
 In ""Automata"" the plot develops in other context; those ""automata"" don't look like slaves. They rather look like products of awkward and unsuccessful human attempt to make ""human-like"" machines, as automata before 20-th century. They are not revolutionaries, they have no reason for that, if humans don't interfere their ""natural"" evolution. They can live without destroying the decaying city where Jacq Vaucan and other characters must live unwillingly to avoid radiation. Violence is made by humans. Many audience maybe don't have sympathy for Jacq who shows compassion for Cleo, but probably have more sympathy for Cleo.Designs of ""automata"" are (most likely, intentionally) old-fashioned, awkward but somehow reminding hand-maid dolls. Human hands made them with soul, so they received it from human and began to live a real life.
 Have you ever seen any films with similar concept of ""automata"". 
 I have. It's ""Ghost in the Shell 2"" by Oshii Mamoru. 
 While Oshii's film was still partly following plot of a detective hunting ""rebel"" androids like ""Blade Runner"", this film is almost completely free from human-centered plot. The last shot of sea is, of course, not real. It's a metaphor of LIFE."

The only problem is that we've kind of seen this story before, which makes it a bit predictable.

" The Story of the Man Who Doesn't Do Anything
",0.0,-0.9971,2017-12-09 00:00:00,1,"this began with intriguing concept of post-apocalyptic future in which robots were built to help fix earth damaged from abnormal solar radiation which has wiped out the majority of humanity. when it becomes clear the projects assigned to the robots aren't actually working, people start to turn on the robots, directing irrational hatred towards them that the planet is essentially doomed.All that is covered in an expo-dump with still images. the movie begins with the idea that these robots are bound by two protocols; never to hurt humans and never to touch themselves (for repair or alteration) and at the start of the film, a randomly drugged up guy finds a robot repairing itself and shoots it in the head.then we get to Antonio banderas as Jacq Vaucan, who works for the company that makes the robots, has a pregnant wife who does nothing in the film, and is tasked with figuring out who is responsible for altering the robot. this somehow leads him and the drugged up cop to Cleo, a robot that has been altered and works as a prostitute. drugged up cop, played by Dylan McDermott, for absolutely no reason goes berserk, shoots off Cleo's leg, and says he will slit Jacq's throat next time they meet.Jacq then encounters the person responsible for altering Cleo, Dr Dupre, and they have a tedious philosophical discussion involving evolution.It genuinely feels to me that a significant portion of the plot got excised at this point, because out of nowhere the company Jacq works for somehow thinks Jacq is the one responsible for altering the robots and has somehow betrayed his entire species. They also inexplicably have footage of a robot altering another robot, footage which never appeared at any point earlier in the film, nor do we ever see or later find out where this footage was acquired.Now the company sends some random children to murder Dr Dupre and Jacq, but Jacq escapes with Cleo. He then gets knocked out in a car crash and Cleo and a bunch of other robots are now dragging him through the desert.We also go back to one of the company men, Robert, who hires the drugged up cop to go find and rescue Jacq and bring him back alive, while the company is trying to kill him for no real reason. The drugged up cop finds Jacq and immediately tries to kill him for absolutely no reason, and Jacq kills him with a flare gun.The drugged up cop's partner escapes and tells the company that Jacq was in the desert with some robots he says were ""alive"" for no reason. The robots did not act differently from regular robots, nor display any sign of disobeying the two protocols. Something went seriously wrong in the writing or editing in this part of the movie.eventually they take Jacq to a place at the end of the desert where they meet the person responsible for first altering robots... and it's a robot as well. this one is apparently conscious and self-aware and has free will and is building a new robot.The company, at this point somehow convinced that Jacq is responsible for altering ALL the robots and trying to escape and has some secret plan of some sort which is explainedThe best we get is a backstory with one of the company executives describing how they made a fully conscious robot that learned everything from humans in 8 days, then became smarter than humans, so they made it develop the Two Protocols for future robots, then deactivated it.Aside from making for interesting backstory, this is in no way relevant to the movie at all, and is never brought up ever again.So now the company has kidnapped Jacq and Robert's wives and Jacq's newborn daughter for no reason. They then send some of their people out to the desert to get Jacq, and then for no reason at all start threatening Robert and then shoots him.At no point is this betrayal explained. When Jacq shows up and finds Robert dying, Robert accuses Jacq of betraying all of mankind, while Jacq literally says that he hasn't even done anything and is just trying to get home. Robert then tells him they have his wife, and Jacq runs off somewhere.The robots are now trying to use a ferry to cross over a dry river to get to a radioactive area where they can go on and live free from humans. The company people then arrive and start killing the robots, apparently thinking they are hiding Jacq or that Jacq is trying to escape with them or something.Then Jacq appears in a car and runs down most of the company men, then gets into a shootout with the head guy. The head guy then accuses Jacq of betraying mankind. For no reason, Jacq only seems to implicate himself, by saying that humans are not his people anymore, which leads me to believe that a massive amount of the movie ended up getting cut. One of the robots, built like a cockroach, goes and kills the company guy and saves Jacq. Cleo and the cockroach then go off into the desert and Jacq and his wife go home.ultimately, this movie spent about 50 minutes as a moody, noirish vibe somewhat reminiscent of ""Blade Runner"" with hints of I, Robot, after which it combusts into an incoherent mess of ill-defined accusations, nonexistent conspiracies, and several boring scenes in the desert culminating in a boring action sequence.And it bears repeating yet again that Jacq Vaucan has not done a single thing for the entire second half of the movie, yet if you hadn't watched his scenes at all you'd think he was Jason Bourne kicking ass all over the city in a fight to clear his name."
" Don't let the reviews fool you
",-0.4404,0.7893,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"Being a fan of Antonio Banderas, I find many of his movies to be poorly rated. I held off this movie because of that. But let me tell you, this movie is far from poor. It may have some clich√©s and what not, but you won't realize it. It's very good and very well acted. The music is exceptional. It amazes me that movies like this has a 30% rating on rotten while John Wick 2 which is essentially rehashed of John Wick has a 89%. Do not follow the reviews, watch it for yourself and judge."
" Pretty good...
",0.4939,0.7398,2017-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Actually have seen Banderas in a couple things recently and have enjoyed his performances - he's a plus for this movie.Liked the premise and for most of the movie its a pretty good mix of sci fi and detective show...Unfortunately the stink of the 'tried and true' Hollywood formulaic approach rears its ugly head, providing what, for me, was a pretty disappointing end.. Gave it a 7, it was an 8 or 9 until then - if only because my hopes have become so low for the movies available on my Roku.."
" It's really good, why the low ratings?
",0.2716,0.9871,2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"The circumstances that lead me to watch this movie were interesting. I was playing Fallout 4 and there's a robot in it called CLE0, supposedly a reference to this movie that also features a robot named that. I googled it and it seemed interesting. I love movies like 'I, Robot' and this one looked similar, so I watched it. It's also shot in Sofia, and I've lived there, so I thought, I really have to see what was made there.The cast is really interesting. Antonio Banderas felt like a strange choice and sometimes was hard to understand, but did an amazing performance. There was also an Asian woman speaking in a British accent, and likely some Bulgarian folk with slavic accents - all this felt odd and unusual. But you could argue this gave the film character.The film shares a lot with 'I, Robot' and 'Wall-E'. Maybe even too much. The setting is a bit strange and inconsistent, it's futuristic, yet people use pagers and old phones, and some futuristic devices were connected with old printer cables - I don't know what they were going for but it was odd.The acting, cinematography, music, CGI (was it CGI or puppetry?) - it's all great. But the writing rehashes from a lot from other movies and could have been better - it didn't improve on anything we've already seen. Antonio Banderas' character was way too helpless and coughing for too long for my liking. I don't enjoy movies with no rewarding character moments or sense of empowerment. I also didn't understand where Jacq and his family were headed in the end.Either way - if you like robot movies - this one is definitely worth watching. I don't know why it flew past my radar when it was first released, but it's pretty fantastic."
" Not bad for what it is!
",0.484,0.9385,2017-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Overall pretty enjoyable, even if a little slow paced and repetitive at times. Most of my problems with the film are, I imagine, related to the budget available to the filmmakers so I let a lot of stuff slide (and to be fair it does still look good in places).My biggest issue is the way humanity is portrayed as an almost entirely irrational, desperate, dying race that can't see the virtue of living side by side with incredibly advanced, living machines. I mean, 99% of the worlds population is gone. Even something so simple as a car is considered rare. The extent to which humans are dependent on robots is never really revealed, so their fear of losing them as servants feels more like pride or ego than survival. And you wonder, with the radioactive desert expanding and human numbers dwindling, if this would really be a priority? I dunno. It just didn't quite sit right with me. But maybe that's how it'd be. Humans can be pretty silly sometimes.Plus there's a huge discrepancy in the fact that human technology has regressed so far as people using fax machines yet the robots are built and maintained somewhere. The humans are using old crt screens and the robots have holographic displays. Hmm.Anyway that said it was still kinda cool. I would've liked to know what Cleo and the newborn were heading towards in the radioactive zone. Other robots? Would she be able to build more once she got there? Who knows!"
" A bad film with robots
",-0.5423,-0.9933,2017-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Jacq Vaucan, an insurance agent working for ROC, the company who invented robots, is faced with an impossible situation. He must investigate a case of robots which violated one of the two base protocols which limited their intelligence and actions. He's about to find some disturbing answers, which will ultimately affect humans' future on what was left of Earth.This is a movie which, through its beginning, reminded me of the brilliant ""I, Robot"" with its robots and their protocols. I was hoping to see something closely interesting to that, but it's light years away from it. Not only is it boring as hell, but it has a plot which is simply stupid, lacking any sort of interest or emotion whatsoever. Banderas' character has no clear implication in the event, often being the man in the middle, struggling to survive some ""concerned"" superiors and the harsh conditions he's being dragged into. Although the post apocalyptic world had promise, it was simply destroyed by an awful plot which wasn't capable of providing any emotion, tension or suspense. You reach the point when you care more about the robots than you do for the humans and that is a very bad thing. Nothing surprising happens, nothing different from what you would expect and absolutely nothing to change the monotone state in which the movie stands all the time.Its finale is as disappointing as it is predictable, doing nothing to change the bleak impression which this film left. A big disappointment from my point of view, in terms of story, almost non existent action and unimportant characters."
" Brainless Cyberpunk
",0.0,0.9646,2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"A) What you state is against the protocolsB) Protocols are contained in the bio-kernel which is based on a quantistic crypto-technologyC) ERGO, what you state is nonsense.This is dumb screenplay enough for me to stop watching anything... even Gemma Arterton going L on Amber Heard and Odette Annable... well, maybe not that extreme...Automata clearly aims to celebrity and achieves nothing but mediocrity: acting and visual design are OK but the writing and especially the overall story design feels like 40 years late. A lot of details signal the superficiality of authors' perspective; the invention and scientific explanations remind me of jokes among high schoolers: when this happens, you know the writer doesn't know what he's talking about. I couldn't watch more than half the movie; maybe it's not that bad, but sci-fi must be good and believable imho: unfortunately this is neither.Blade Runner (and 10-20 other major movies) was written by someone with a little knowledge yet enough creativity and wisdom to avoid goofs: this is a bad clone by someone who can't find the difference between a Turing machine and a blender. OR - even more seriously - the difference between a drama and a parody."
" Antonio Banderas in a Blade Runner-Esque Future Noir
",0.0,0.9716,2017-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Just viewed this film which probably did not have a wide scale cinema release and it is much better than a recent film with similar themes which I viewed at the cinema, Ghost In The Shell starring Scarlett Johansson. Spanish Director, Gabe Ibanez has a talent for showing us a desolate future like scenario and I would like to explore more of this work from this point on. Banderas plays his role well, head shaven, letting his years show. His performance reeks of an actor who is good at his profession, the years have padded his abilities with an actors' wisdom and role is acted quite nicely, understated and we can sympathize with the actions of his character. All in all, a film worth seeking out and filing alongside (perhaps a row beneath) other classics such as Blade Runner in your film collection."
" Overlooked gem
",-0.0258,0.9598,2017-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Gabe Ib√°√±ez's Automata had the misfortune of being released in the shadow of another film concerning robotics and artificial intelligence, Ex Machina. It's hard to compete with the kind of hype that film generated back in 2015, and as such it kind of slipped through the cracks. It's a shame because there's much about that's striking, stylized and fascinating, despite being a bit too elaborate for it's own good. Drenched in a rainy neon Blade Runner atmosphere, it follows a bleak story involving insurance investigator Jacq Vaucan (a bald, somber Antonio Banderas) as he navigates a broken world ravaged by solar storms that have whittled down the human populace to around twenty million. Robots have been employed to rebuild the dying infrastructure, and Jacq keeps tabs in case any of them violate their primary directive, under the stewardship of his boss (Robert Forster). When rogue police officer Wallace (Dylan McDermott is dynamite) shoots a robot he claims was trying to alter itself, Jacq surmises that there's a 'clocksmith' out there trying to give them minds of their own. It's all very vague and we never really have anything more than illusory whispers or half explained concepts to go on, but these matters find him and the company's nasty head of security (Tim McInnerney) venturing far out into the desert where a faction of robots, led by Javier Bardem no less, have grossly deviated their protocol and are evolving into¬Ö something else. Banders's once wife Melanie Griffith does double duties as a creepy liaison in their case and the voice of a sympathetic sex slave- bot who plays a key role. I'm not entirely sure what the story arc is supposed to be, as it's often muddled and dense, but it seems confident that it has one, and isn't just flying blind into Euro experimental abstract mode as some scenes suggest. It has a point to make, it's just wrapped that up in enigmatic fashion and cloaked any sense of linear exposition in blankets of atmospheric ambient sound, deliberately indistinct story beats and strangeness. I'm okay with that to an extant, as there's plenty to enjoy visually, especially with the robots and their design, but many won't be and will want more than just machine dreams without a manual to guide them. I for one enjoyed the memorable image of bald, parka clad Banderas hunting primordial androids in a washed out, used up wasteland. All that's missing is a score by Vangelis or Tangerine Dream."
" Very well thought and brilliantly made and wonderful Soundtrack. It deserves more attention!
",0.8856,0.9849,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"It's one of those movies that should have gotten more attention but due to the trailer and time of release it never made it through the shroud. It's hard to think that this movie only had a 7 million $ budget, The acting is on point the visual effects are in my opinion better than some of the super high budget movies that were released during the same time. What i love about this movie is how dark it is, i'm a fan of dystopian future movies and i have to say this is one of the better ones i've seen in a very long time, Sure it's not as good as the best such as 1984, Metropolis and v for vendetta but it deserves more attention and a solid place in the Dystopian/Dark futuristic movies. To note: I've encountered this many times people who only look at the User rating and if it's bellow lets say 7 it automatically is a ""BAD"" movie. DON'T be Like those people! Solid 8/10."
" soulless
",0.0,-0.9813,2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"What happens when machines out evolve us? It is a theme explored since the nineteenth century, and across genres. Automata does a good job of anthropomorphising its robots. Ironically, the main problem is the humans are less well developed. The film wears its Blade Runner influences lightly, and the production design is creditable, but at least in BR the other humans beyond Deckard were also complex and plausible. The bad guys in Automata lack motivations and carry out actions that make no sense. Language is one causal factor: the script has clearly been written by someone whose first language is not English, and so the dialogue is stilted and unnatural. This is fine when it comes from Banderas, as that is natural English for non-native speakers, but placed in the mouths of his boss and antagonists, it draws unwanted attention to itself. The plot falls apart in the end - there is no need to violently confront the robots, other than tick the box for 'shoot out.' Most bizarre of all is the wife presenting the baby to her husband who has been shot, beat up, starved and looks half-dead. Of all the reactions a wife might have to finding her husband in this state, this one was the least likely. It is symptomatic of a tonally inconsistent movie that fails to mine rich thematic potential and is unsure of what it wants to say."
" Slow and Tiring
",0.0,0.5023,2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"This movie has two weak spots.First, it reminds us the I, Robot movie a lot. From the laws that bind the robot programs (that are based in Asimov's novel), to the very design of the robots. The result, way worse in my opinion.The second flaw I think is in the plot. It is very slow for such a huge story.Also Antonio is completely out of what we used him for, and what we want him to play. The complete absence of action in this movie makes you want to fast forward it the entire time.If a friend of mine wanted to watch a sci-fi with robots, I would recommend about 10 to 15 other movies before I think of Automata and if he would ask me to recommend a Banderas movie, I would probably go with every other movie but this."
" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.9902,2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"No many special effects like American movies but even so a good work. Antonio Banderas without doubt is always a great attraction of the movie. Another amazing thing is the design of the robots, their movements, their expressions and their way of walking. OK that the stories about robots are almost always the same however the photograph of this film is simply wonderful. Watch please."
