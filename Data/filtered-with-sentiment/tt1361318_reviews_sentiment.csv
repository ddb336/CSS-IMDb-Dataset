" Interesting, but disjointed
",-0.2732,0.6531,2021-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Everyone would like to find a boatload of cash, right?
Good premise.
What I don't understand is why they didn't hid the money elsewhere and move out because they were evicted. All true.
They had to move anyway...and could have done it without raising suspicion.
But that's too obvious...lol."
" Just dumb
",-0.5106,-0.9795,2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"This is a compilation of dumb people.
Spoiler alert :
Couple makes bad decisions non stop. But hey, he is a real sniper with a nail gun. And the so called organized gang are probably the most idiotic group of people put together. Killing eachother and getting killed by a carpenter with no skills . The story behind the cop is never explained and he must be a terminator as he just can't die. I usually finish movies out of respect for the people making it but this was a tough one to sit out. Let's rename this movie ""dumb people""."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.4404,2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Action packed fast moving drama with good acting young JamesFranco, Katie Hudson and Tom Wilkinson."
" Worth your time
",0.2263,-0.7081,2020-09-23 00:00:00,7,I'm surprised this movie got so little stars! It kept you thinking who will die and I just want to put it out there if I found a bag of money I'd NEVER give it to the police. That'll be the stupidest thing a wallet yes a bag of money hell no! That being said it's a good movie and I'm glad I watched it.
" Unrealistic - predictable- a deadly combination- not really spoilers
",0.0,-0.994,2020-09-11 00:00:00,2,"I am really getting fed up, one bad movie, TV show after another. these Amazon Prime, but they are not alone.Really predictable.this isn't a spolier bec it's in the description before you see the film.Strke 1: Dave goes downatairs in the basement, because of loud TV. he doesn't answer so they entr. Clearly overwhelming smell (reactions of Kate & Dave) So if her were dead that long to smell, why didn't the TV bothe them before.Strike 2: now after the police are there, they had rented the basement, so they clean up, and discover in the ceiling behind some cork or fiber board, #220K Euro(?) hidden . this plot point is used so often. No one has a drop celing with moveable board, Maybe in the 70s- they they did a recessed ceiling in kitchen of house. glass with recessed lighting. very retro & torn out bec. it's dated. not in the rooms, maybe bathroom,Strike 3: where did he get the money? maybe from some murderous drug kingpin gangster. whot took his sweet time to go look for it. they figure out the owners up stairs have a show of unfound money to pay off debts.Strike 4: London Police Detectice, Tom, whose son died from a drug overdose. want to bet it's the gangster who is looking for his money. the older man on disability tenant, died of a form of heroin, overdose. if it was murder, why didn't they wool for the money before leaving? the ceiling would be the 1st place.Strike 5: Tom figue the drug kingpin is looking for the money Dave kate ""stole""- he wa dead, but it was theft. Not to go to jail, they are being forced to be decoys to catch the man responsible fo his death, off the books."
" Sometimes Good People are Bad
",-0.1531,0.8316,2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Good People is predictable yet still suspenseful. A good story that examines one of humanity's worst traits - greed. Excellent cast who give understated, powerful performances. All in all an entertaining thriller."
" Good Movie!
",0.4926,0.1268,2020-08-29 00:00:00,4,I'm not a great reviewer but I'll keep it short and sweet...Great acting and plot! Give it a watch...Make your own decisions. It's worth a watch..period..end of quote.
" ""Good, Stupid People""
",-0.5267,-0.9822,2020-08-22 00:00:00,4,"The movie was an ok watch that I somewhat regretted, great cast and acting but the title should be ""Good, Stupid People"" as these people make stupid decisions over and over again and not just the key plot points. Also many things in the film are beyond stupid from the very beginning with thieves sitting in car scoping their target location right in front of the bar in small empty parking lot... to victims returning to their houses... to plotting scheme with police outside their hotel where the thief has already called and alerted that he's watching. Don't forget throwing the bag of millions in cash repeatedly in the back of a pickup.
Not a surprise I had never heard of this film."
" Good People...
",0.4404,-0.8974,2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"...bad movie. Sorry, couldn't resist writing that to be funny. Not really bad, just nothing particularly good either. Franco and Hudson picking up paychecks with the undistinguished script, British actors playing baddies going into their actors' Baddy toolbox to bring out the standard Baddy attitudes and actions, and acquit themselves well enough. In the midst of all the mayhem, there's a baby thrown into the mix to tug at your heart strings. And nothing in Franco's character that he should turn from average joe into an incredible hulk to defeat a villain twice his size, but to expect otherwise in such a movie would be ask8ng too much. Included are a lot of novel, violent, gory ways to kill people, if you're into that. Otherwise, eh"
" Decent but boring
",-0.4497,0.8481,2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,"What to do when you find a big amount of money. Makes sense you wanna keep it, but the movie would be short if that was the right decision. It just didn't catch me. All pretty predictable. OK acting, but all in all it just moved on and then it was over"
" Overall pretty good
",0.7269,0.9669,2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"The beginning is pretty boring, but it leads to a very thrilling end that had me at the edge of my seat. It had a good meaning behind it about how a couple needs to stick together! The title was a good choice! A lot of couples and low income families can relate to this movie. It was nice to see the ""Good People"" win one. Also had a lot of innovated kills."
" Much Better Than The Reviews Indicate - About A 7-8 Stars Movie
",0.4404,0.8903,2020-03-12 00:00:00,8,"03/12/2020 This was my second watch, much of the storyline I had forgot. It was actually better this time. The first half is layering the storyline and where all the characters come in. the second half is full of twists, plenty of violence (my favorite genre) and suspense as it winds down. Really pretty fun ending. Definitely a must watch at least once. Bon Appetit'"
" Keeping a bag of money is always a good idea...
",0.4404,0.9209,2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,"In a cross-purpose marketing trick to get both American and English viewers to want to watch this movie, a young American couple, James Franco and Kate Hudson, is struggling to make ends meet in their small English flat. When their landlord dies and they find a bag of cash among his belongings, they decide to keep and use the money to help change their luck. Do you think they'll get away with it? If you do, you've obviously never seen one of these movies before, and you'll be shocked every step of the way.While the preview looks like it's advertising an entertaining movie, I got the overall feeling that everyone acting in the movie felt he or she could do better. It is entertaining and fast-paced, but when you watch one actor from In the Bedroom and another from Howl, you can't help but wonder what they're doing in a mediocre thriller. Still, I always watch these types of movies because there are no surprises. If that's what you're looking for and you like the cast, go ahead and rent it."
" More like: Dumb People
",-0.1987,-0.9366,2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Wow, this movie was really bad! We start off with a robbery and betrayal, and then by meeting a young couple- nice teacher (Kate Hudson) and hard working contractor? (James Franco- who is not at all convincing as a contractor), who are struggling with finances. Well, yada, yada, yada, they find some money from the robbery, know they shouldn't use it but overnight these two turn into complete morons who had about five chances to get out of their predicament, yet kept choosing to keep the money, which isn't even that big of an amount, at least not enough to risk a lot of lives for. Tom Wilkinson, whom I really like, is wasted in this movie and I'm actually sorry to see him in it. He plays a cop with a backstory that is not really clear and a snotty boss that hates him- tell me you haven't seen that cliche' before. Anyway, Franco and Hudson seem to immediately adapt to being hunted and seeing people killed in front of them doesn't really seem to be an issue- are these really ""Good People""? No, they're actually stupid, trashy, people who clearly don't tell each other anything and they each have spending problems. Why this movie had to be set in England with two American lead actors is something I don't know, this garbage could have been set anywhere in the U.S. I guess the fact that it was set in England was the twist? I don't know. Finally, in the climactic scene, the leader of one of the biggest drug cartels in the world shows up to get his $220k (seriously, this is couch cushion money to someone like that) with only one bodyguard/hoodlum to help him out. Predictably, both druglords (yes, there are TWO of them fighting over $220k!) are outsmarted and outlasted by a teacher and a terrible contractor, and the day is saved. This movie is fun if you want to just sit and poke fun at all the plot holes, but otherwise is a horrible bore."
" Not sure why low rating?
",-0.0382,0.9153,2019-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand people these days. This is well directed, well acted thriller worth seeing. Intense, dramatic and with great cast, both good and villians."
" It's Every British ""Crime"" Movie You've Ever Seen
",0.0,-0.3716,2019-08-03 00:00:00,3,"We just keep getting the same movies over and over. Originality is such a rare commodity these days. This is pretty clearly A Simple Plan mashed up, oddly enough, with Home Alone. The actors walk through it woodenly. There is little suspense. A decent bit of violence. Every cliche of the genre. Watchable, sure, but in the same way you might watch an episode of a tv show in its ten millionth season. Why bother?"
" Absolutely, Perfectly, Defines Mediocre
",0.6697,0.9447,2019-06-09 00:00:00,5,"""Good People"" is so totally average that if it were a ball, it would be a perfectly smooth and featureless billiard ball. It's watchable and basically keeps you paying attention (although I kept stopping it to see how much was left--it's a long 90 minutes), but the plot is pretty predictable and the acting is beyond ordinary and not involving or convincing. I'd probably call it about equivalent to well-done network TV. So, if you're desperate for something to watch, this will probably do, but if you put just a little more work into it, you shouldn't have any problem finding something you'll like better. This isn't even French Vanilla, or New York Vanilla, it's simply Vanilla Vanilla. I hope nobody got paid too much for this."
" I'M EXPANDING MY EMPIRE

Ben dies, they find money, they need money, bad guys figure out they have it.This is another couple discover drug money, can't call cops, bad guys come after them film. There are other films like this out there and most of them are done badly. The reason these type of films don't work is the ""why didn't they....?"" questions. When you know the bad guys are coming for you, buy quality diamonds and smuggle them into the US where you resell them. Diamonds smuggle easier than cash. You can swallow them in a baggie if you like.The action wasn't that great. The dialogue wasn't cool. The bad guy (Omar Sy) called himself Genghis Khan. Seriously? That's what they wrote to be clever. Not enough honest cops to help out. The excitement level wasn't there until the last twenty minutes where our home renovator...oh don't want to reveal that one.Parental Guide: F-bomb. forced groping. Kate Hudson butt nudity."
" Delightfully gory and satisfying...

" Better than expected, but not great
",-0.5409,-0.1614,2017-12-17 00:00:00,5,"GOOD PEOPLE is an unremarkable British crime thriller that just so happens to have a couple of American actors, Kate Hudson and James Franco, as the leads. They play a down-on-their-luck couple who come into possession of a bag containing a huge amount of money, but their decision to keep hold of the mystery cash is a fateful one when the owners - a bunch of murderous drug dealers - come calling for it. The main surprise about this film is that the casting is pretty decent, with Hudson and Franco doing well to convince in their roles and the rest of the cast doing a solid job. The story is predictable and the script is pretty poor, with an over-reliance on profanity for effect, but the harsh violence hits home and the action bits are solid enough."
" Sushi night.........
",0.0,-0.8558,2017-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Anna and Tom, a married wanting to start a family are struggling financially. Just as they are about to lose their apartment, the tenant who had been renting their basement dies and they find a lot of money hidden there. The money belongs to a very dangerous man who naturally wants it back and both Tom and Anna have to decide whether to keep the money and risk their lives or give the money to the cops and start all over again.The first thing you notice when you watch this film is just how similar to Boyle's Shallow Grave it is. But where that film offered an air of isolation between the the protagonists, this is just another paint by numbers thriller that has no right to have such a good cast.Franco, who has turned into this decades Samuel L. Jackson by starring in everything released, is perfectly fine, as is Kate Hudson.........as is Tom Wilkinson.And this is the fundamental problem with the film, it's just perfectly fine.You have the bloke from Taken 3 and London To Brighton as the Main bad guy, but seeing him in other films, such as Legend, you know he is just on autopilot for this.Bad guys come, bad guys go, Franco gets injured, Wilkinson investigates, Friel annoys. And this goes on a loop until the final act when it turns into a house under siege thriller for no good reason.It's not rubbish, the performances stop it from edging toward the mundane, but this could have been a two part drama for the BBC on a Sunday night, and would have garnered more interest."
