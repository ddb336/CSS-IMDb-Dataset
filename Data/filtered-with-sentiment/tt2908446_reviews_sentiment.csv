" Schwentke prefers to focus on the dizzying visual effects, but the objective involving discoveries and revenge works as the main focus for the evolution of the script
",-0.6808,0.9954,2021-03-13 00:00:00,6,"In the first film Tris (Shailene Woodley) transforms, as in the passage from childhood to puberty. In Insurgent, he deals with one of the greatest difficulties of maturation: acceptance of himself. With features from all factions - Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the altruistic), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful) and Scholar (the intelligent) - it doesn't fit anywhere and thinks its existence is a disservice to the world. Rebellion is the great message of the franchise. In his existential crisis, the teenager discovers that he does not need to accept the rules imposed by the world, he does not need to limit his existence to outdated values. With Tris and her self-questions at the center, the public that still seeks the paths of cultural and sexual liberation finds a voice. Discover that you are special, no matter what others say.The impact of the violence, unlike what happened in the past film, is transmitted to the public and felt on screen in a powerful way - especially by Tris -, with some emotionally charged deaths, conducted efficiently by Schwentke. Visually, the feature has also evolved considerably, featuring good special effects and a more functional production design. Insurgent develops in a very linear way, without surprises or major revelations. First of all, it must be kept in mind that this is an intermediate sequence - it is the adaptation of the second book of a trilogy - and, as it usually happens in these cases, there is no clear beginning, much less a satisfactory conclusion. Just as we entered the story in a bit of a fright - those who did not watch the previous feature will certainly be lost - there is also nothing to be explained at the end, leaving the necessary links for the following chapters.In the cast, Shailene Woodley remains primarily responsible for making this story believable and exciting. The young actress builds a remarkable evolution of the character, gradually moving between indignation and action, love and hate. Without the subtlety of her expressions, scenes like Tris facing herself could seem a little comical. Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller gain ambiguous contours, more interesting than in the previous film, but the justification for their changes in attitude is too simple and too fast, compromising the coherence of their characters. Theo James, again, is the weak link in the middle of the good cast. At least his character becomes a mere helper to the female protagonist, reversing the prevailing macho logic in action films.Octavia Spencer and Daniel Dae Kim do very well in their short but important scenes for the plot. The choice of Naomi Watts is questionable for the role of a rebel leader of the factionless. Due to the short explanation of her past, the talented actress can do little to make the character more complex. Kate Winslet is sadly underutilized: it is quite an affront to choose an actress of this level for such a shallow role, limited geographically to a single room, with the same gestures. Winslet could easily turn Jeanine into an extremely evil and perverse villain, but she prefers to keep her more restrained, human, and perhaps for that very reason a little monotonous.This ill-conceived justification for the character Caleb's arc, by the way, is one of several points that do not make sense in this continuation, affecting central elements of the plot and some events of the plot, completely undermining the rest of the production. It is difficult to swallow the mystery of the box - which lasts until the end of production - when Ray Stevensson's character practically begs to explain what is happening to the heroes - and to the audience. Of course, like any project involving the genre, Insurgent is also full of betrayals and surprises in the course of it. However, the title is very damaged due to its oscillations between shelters, searches for an army and revelations. Little by little, he enters this great roller coaster of moments, gaining prominence in some points and showing weaknesses in so many others.Even so, there is still that tension in the air through certain events and even more when it moves towards its final stretch and the decisions of its protagonist. The objective of opening the box found is also clear throughout the script, but it provides less impact than it should with the introduction of such an object. The existence of the box itself and the reasons for Jeanine's search for opening it also borders on the absurd, being a nonsense that an object that would bring about the end of the divergent could only be opened by a divergent - which, in turn, implodes the ""learned"" stance of the antagonist interpreted by Winslet. Crowning this festival of silliness, the film ends in an ""apotheosis"" revelation.It is also worth mentioning that, even with great differences in the book for its adaptation, the objective involving discoveries and revenge works as the main focus for the evolution of the script. Jeanine seeks answers and ways to end the Divergent out of fear and her ambition for power, while Tris wants to eliminate the person responsible for the death of her parents and an entire faction, as well as trying to prove her innocence. However, the most interesting thing is when the meetings take place and this presents a new path through a major turnaround, introducing answers and new questions to show the beginning of an unexpected situation. Mysteries remain in the air, as well as the expectation for the completion of the film series.Insurgent is very similar to its predecessor, especially in its problems. The plot, which was already shallow in the first film, here continues the same way, carrying all the problems caused and accumulated in Divergent. The weak connections between the characters, the lack of motivation and the lack of chemistry between the main couple are even more prominent here. For those who know the books it is even worse, because the lack of care is very clear. An example is the relationship between Tris and Christina (Zoë Kravitz), which goes through ups and downs, but in the film it is demonstrated in a very superficial way, without a minimum development after some important events.
As for the pace, there are some good moments that take the film up, especially in combat scenes, such as the invasions of Scholarly Friendship and Frankness or the fight on the train, which carry a welcome tension for the audience, but in others there is a waste of time. Some scenes in which we accompany Tris in his simulations and dreams are too long for a short objective. The impression it gives is that they were filmed to show the visual potential of the film, which, as stated above, is weak. These scenes are even more problematic due to a simplistic visual effects work, without much finishing.On the technical side, all the producers' attention seems to have been turned to the visual effects show. There is an ostentatious amount of CGI, with action scenes created digitally and projected on green screens. The scenarios of the simulations are grandiose, but at the same time not very creative - after all, suspended buildings, ruined buildings and cables connected to the characters' bodies are not exactly a novelty in the genre. Despite the conventional aspect, this sequence presents a greater production than that of Divergent, with a more refined visual and intelligent use of 3D, exploring the depth of field and making the action scenes (such as the invasion at the top of the building) more exciting. .Divergent was a shallow film, which barely presented the universe of the saga, and Insurgent made the same mistakes at a time when everything should be settled. The ending is one of the few most exciting moments in the film, not least because it is where we see the track and visuals working better and in sync. Something in common that these teen sagas have is to increase their ambitions and grandiosity with each continuation, guaranteeing a renewed interest from fans and the curious. Robert Schwentke, who takes over as Neil Burger, leaves aside the most daring choices of his precursor and invests only in the guaranteed. At least, Insurgent maintains the option of privileging women in command positions. Tris is not demure and passive, like certain heroines in love with other adaptations of teenage books. She takes the initiative, shooting, jumping, jumping, having sexual desire and a warrior fury that goes beyond the simple urge to do justice. The roadmap also includes, albeit quickly, a discussion of how social minorities are treated in undemocratic societies and are made to feel guilty about social ills. It cannot be forgotten that the divergent is a metaphor for the different and minority citizen (fat, gay, black, disabled, weird, as you prefer), transformed here into an essential superhero for the maintenance of social balance.Schwentke prefers to focus his attention on the dizzying visual effects. Good actors wander through explosions, glass prisons and old world ruins, without ever connecting with the scenery and the cold colors that surround them. The fight scenes, like the moment on the train, are impressive and functional to describe the character's physical and mental strength. Tris resembles a superheroine - and tests, in this sense, do nothing more than prove her superpowers. In the eyes of its target audience, Insurgent works, with lessons in resistance, overcoming and acceptance. For those who have reached maturity, however, two hours in the cinema need more than self-help messages to gain meaning."

" An honorable continuation, but with problems in the script.
",-0.3182,0.9968,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident cases, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"".In this film, the follow-up of ""Divergent"", we will see Jeannine's rise to power and the escape of Tris and Four. They lost friends and family in the military coup against Abnegation, and they take refuge with the Amity. The truce, however, is short: while Jeannine needs to find a specific, particularly strong Divergent, who opens a box where the Founders recorded a message, Four will find an unlikely ally, determined to overthrow the Erudite: his mother, Evelyn, who all assumed to be dead.Personally, I think the film is a very dignified continuation, which honors the predecessor and entertains the audience quite well. Nevertheless, and like the first film, the script suffers from serious logic problems. For example, the strange way in which Tris looks traumatized and in shock with the events at the end of the previous film and quickly overcomes this, being able to fight. I think it would have been better for the film to follow the original book more closely, which was not done.Imported from the previous film, the cast is quite good and competent. Shailene Woodley is beautiful, and I was surprised to see her without her long hair, but it was a change of look that fits the film and marks how much the character was marked by the previous events. The actress, moreover, did a good job. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, and I feel that he had more space and screen time to work here. Miles Teller is good, but hateful, and Jai Courtney is even more hateful, brutish and sadistic than in the first movie, which was great, given that the character demanded it. Kate Winslet goes from coldness to absolute inhumanity and transforms Jeannine into a potential genocide, while her arch rival, Evelyn, was brilliantly played by Naomi Watts, clearly implying that she is not, and will never be, a good option to rule the city. On the negative side, I was sad to see the way Zoe Kravitz almost disappeared from the film and I hated the constant changes in loyalty of Ansel Elgort's character.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild the buildings? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. The sets and costumes were very well done, the highlight being the Amity headquarters, which looks like a mix of futuristic planting and a hippie camp. The soundtrack also fits into the overall ensemble."
" Just... wow, this is repulsing
",0.5859,0.9528,2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"Insurgent.There are many many many instances of plot convenience littered all the way throughout this movie, like the ""truth serum"" sequence, which I think was just used as an uncreative plot device to get her to confess, I can think of several better ways they could've done this off the top of my head. The plot convenience alone, affects the horrible pacing the most. Literally 30 minutes in, the setting had changed way too many times, and way too abruptly as well. On top of a this, a lot of things go unexplained, most the time it's just because the movie just assumes you remember every tiny detail from the first movie, and ceases to provide any backstory or flashback, even when there is a clear opportunity for a well placed flashback sequence, like at the beginning.
Also, most of the main characters in this film, tend to be not very memorable or likeable. like Theo James's character, Tobias, he can just kill people, with feeling very little remorse. And Miles Teller's character, Peter, literally went from slight antagonist, to an actual villain, with little explanation. Later he... suddenly, wasn't the villain anymore?? Idk. The main villain, ""Jeanine"" is really lacking in character depth, she's just power hungry, like, there was one time where she said ""I am doing this for the greater good"" which I think was a pretty good line actually, it shows the moral dilemmas she has to face. OH WAIT! the ""greater good"" is just her wanting to control everything, so nevermind. Towards the ends of the movie, Tris ""dies"" whenever Jeanine tries to use her divergent crap or whatever, to open some box? And it would've been completely fine if they ended the movie there, and of course changed some things up here and there in the previous parts of the narrative, and somehow explained what was in the box, but no, they had to drag it out even longer because they realized the pacing sucks and it happened way to fast. Then it all turns out to be an experiment... YAY! im done watching this garbageBut the acting is pretty good though.... but that's it."

",0.0,0.9911,2021-01-26 00:00:00,3,"I'm not very old, only in my teens, but I read the Divergent series and loved it with all my heart. It has an amazing plot, amazing characters, and a lot of twists and turns. The movie Divergent was ok. But Insurgent was very very bad.SPOILERS!The whole movie was pretty ok until the end. it missed a lot of important details. Peter, Tris, and Tobias leave the Erudite compound and go to abnegation where the factionless and dauntless are staying. The factionless explain the plan and the dauntless agree, except for Tris and Christina. They know it's not right. So, they team up with Marcus to save the information when the factionless want to destroy it. They sneak into Amity where Johanna recognizes them and ask what they're doing. They need to speak to the Erudite she is hiding there so they do and find Cara (Will's older sister) and Fernando and a couple others. They make a plan and sneak into erudite, Fernando makes up the word Insurgent and hen he dies. None of that happens. Tori never stabs Jeanine, you never see Lynn die, nor is she or Marlene even introduced. Then the factionless reveal that they want to kill everyone apart of the dauntless faction because they are a threat to society. But Tobias releases the information and Amanda Ritter is inteoduced. She explains important details and then, at the very end, she says that she is taking up a disguise and changing her name to fit in. Her new name is Edith Prior.None of anything I just said happened in the movie. The plot is compeletely different, and the book is SO much better. I understand that sometimes movies change things around and make things a bit different and unique, but this was totally off track and didn't even have anything to do with what happened on the book. I had some hopes for the movie but as the movie went on, they turned to nothing. The movie was not as good as I though it was going to be, not even close. I advise you not to watch the movie if you have read the books. It will make you very very frustrated."

" Home for Poor Actors
",-0.4767,0.2846,2020-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Well, I guess even lacklustre actors can find work ... sad but true. Is Shailene Woodley the world's most unemotional, unskilled actor? How she's found any work since is truly a wonder.
And the even sadder note is that the amazing Kate Winslet actually got roped in to this debacle ... and worse, pathetic directing can make you even question her usually top notch skills.
I hope there's a self destruct on all copies of this wretched film so that future generations don't have to think that there was a period of time where humanity had lost its ever loving mind.
Schwentke should spend the rest of his days hunting down and purging ever project he's ever mishandled.

" It Ain't No Hunger Games
",0.3875,-0.4394,2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"I tend to like all these YA dystopian films- Hunger Games which I loved and Maze Runner which was okay. I wanted to like the Divergent series and the first one was alright but as a series it just never hits it right. The characters are not so engaging, there's no connection - whereas we are totally invested in the Hunger Games. The writing is at fault. The sets are generally sparse and futuristic but in all there didn't seem to be the budget. As a Netflix series Divergent may have been a big hit but as films they are pretty mediocre."

I know that movies don't follow the books very well, but I enjoyed Divergent and could not wait for Insurgent. This movie really disappointed me. I had high hopes for it. The reason was that I loved the book and knew they would change the story, but they changed it so dramatically it hardly had anything in common with the book, and the story/plot they used to replace the books story/plot was incomparable- I loved the book far better. I guess what I'm getting to here is IF you read the book and you're a huge fan of the book, this movie will disappoint.Along with that- the acting was great- but the plot in my opinion was very predictable and poorly written."

Of all my problems from 'Divergent', only the score improves here.Shailene Woodley's Tris is somehow a little unlikable in 'Insurgent', despite being the protagonist - many of her character motivations are a little up-and-down. Theo James (Four) is roughly the same, though Ansel Elgort's Caleb is utterly pointless; not helped by the filmmakers taking a strange direction with him.Miles Teller (Peter) gets more screen-time, not entirely sure why though - and that's coming from someone who is fine with him in the last production. Kate Winslet remains massively underused as the main villain, I don't connect with her at all.The premise in this second film of the series is underwhelming and not all that exciting, making use of the factionless is the right step but they don't exactly nail giving them a larger part.With all that said, I do actually like how this concludes. It should set up a strong third film. Right...? I'll soon find out! It is, so far, a missed opportunity of a franchise."

It just seems quite bland.That's really all I can say. This film is just bland."

The book is a completely separate work and if the producer of a movie wants to change the story it doesent mean the movie will automatically be bad. Simple.This whole series is great.

Not so with this film. I enjoyed ""Divergent"" more. That's not to say I didn't like this movie, just not as much. I still thought it was great. Some parts were a bit unnecessary and slow, I thought the way they filmed the action sequences was great, though. The ending made me wonder ""How are they going to continue this?"" and I'm excited to see how, whenever that may be. There was a bit of overacting by Shailene Woodley in this film (her crying felt forced and unrealistic) but the other actors did a great job. It's not the best YA series out there, but it is still enjoyable. I'm excited to see part 3 (and possibly 4).

The action is great and leaves you on the edge of your seat. The acting is very good, especially from Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Theo James, Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, and Naomi Watts. The characters are developed well in this movie as the story progresses. The only part of the movie that was dragged was the scene with Tris and Kate Winslet.

I haven't read the book so I am leaving a happier and better rating. I think this movie was good and I recommend it to any fan of action or even romance movies. There were some plot holes but you can figure it out it is definitely not worth the one or two that some users have it. However it's up to you to decide whether it's worth your time or not watch then look at the rating cus they can be discouraging.
" Darker than the first movie
",0.0,0.8742,2019-12-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is more darker and more mature and much more violent than the first movie. It has great themes and they give you heavy stuff to think about. The animation is spectacular and I love this more than the first movie. The acting is top notch - especially with Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet. Woodley steps up with her acting and you truly believe that she IS the character she's portraying. She really embraces and doesn't shy away from the issues Tris is struggling and dealing with. She makes Tris extremely relatable and human and I found myself crying at several of her scenes - she's extremely good.
And then there's Kate Winslet. She is PERFECT as the movie's villain. She is cold and evil and she does it extremely well. She is an excellent, excellent actress.
With the violence, while there's definitely more than in the first movie, thankfully they keep it (mostly) just off-camera, but the implication of what is happening is very obvious and if you think about the implication too much, it could make your stomach turn.
It is a solid sequel and I can't wait to watch the next movie!"

" Insurgent - the torture continues
",-0.5994,-0.4391,2019-10-16 00:00:00,3,"The second chapter of the Divergent series, follow up from the exact same point in which the first movie ended. Insurgent improved slightly the story telling and is less boring, even if some scenes are completely unnecessary. Action scenes, that should be the main core of this production are embarrassing: who worked on the title clearly do not know how to use a green screen properly, and CGI effects can be definitely better. Moreover, as usual Shailene Woodley (Tris), is completely flat in her acting, you don't know if she is angry, sad or happy, because she does not have any facial expression, it seems that you are looking at a rock. Theo James has more or less the same acting skills: a tree trunk. The only one that did a decent job is Kate Winslet, as the main villain.I don't even know how you can release a movie like this, with a budget of 110 millions dollars (IMDb movie page as source) and not to put some efforts on a technical perspective, maybe actors were too expensive? I don't have idea, the only thing that I know is that I thought that doing worse than the previous chapter was impossible, but they made it: they managed to fail harder.I will try to watch also the third and last movie to see if at least in the end they were able to save something, but I highly doubt."

As with any futuristic drama, you have to suspend your belief and ignore a few plot holes but there was nothing silly or insulting to my intelligence. I knocked off 2 stars for the uninspired mood music and the rather quiet dialogue. I thought that it was slightly better than the previous movie as the factions weren't overly exaggerated but rather accepted and simply part of the story.
In my opinion, the low ratings are strange. There are not a lot of other movies today that I feel have a good story and are well presented and acted. And exciting!"

Don't know what's with some of the negative reviews, I personally liked the film great acting and had me gripped through the whole movie.

" Why this movie is bad and continuously receives terrible ratings
",-0.765,0.9517,2019-07-26 00:00:00,1,"Although the Divergent series is old I have just started reading the books and am now on the third, Allegiant. After I completed the first book I was ecstatic to see how the ingenious book would be converted to a movie expecting the same transformation that the Hunger Games series made, which was wonderful. But i was sadly mistaken.The first movie, Divergent, was very humorous to me and I spent most scenes laughing at the conversion of the characters, plot, and even some settings. I tried to over look it though keeping at least a sliver of hope that insurgent might be better because of the change in directors. So I read Insurgent, the story carried its brilliance and raised my hope to assurance that even if the casting will be the same, there is no way that the director can let down this amazing story, but again mistaken. The movie ruins the reputation that the books received and i am astounded that Veronica Roth herself would let this movie into the public. First off, the plot is lost in every scene making this dystopian world sound war riddled instead of secretive and hidden. Also, the acting is such a let down considering the numerous famous actors and actresses casted, the main characters seem confused instead of strong because of the weak acting that Woodley and James withheld throughout the movie. Lastly, even large events in the book were overlooked because of the time the director wasted to put unimportant factors that are not even relevant to the story!Do not watch this movie and the others of this series, save yourself the time and dignity. I do suggest reading the books though because as I suggested they are brilliant and truly inspiring pieces of art, which is why I am writing this review. If I could sum this movie into one word it would be, disappointment. This movie is a disappointment. The acting is a disappointment. The time I took to watch this movie disappoints me."
" A solid follow-up to 'Divergent'
",0.1531,0.9961,2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"This film opens five days after the end of 'Divergent'; Jeanine has declared martial law and placed the blame for the massacre of Abnegation on Divergents. Tris, Four and others who survived have found sanctuary with Amity Faction but must move again when Dauntless forces loyal to Jeanine turn up. They manage to escape and find themselves amongst the factionless. They then continue into the city and reunite with other free members of Dauntless at Candour Faction. While this is going on Jeanine acquires a box containing a message from the city's founders... to open it she requires a Divergent who rates extremely highly in each of the five faction tests. Not surprisingly the person who is most likely to achieve this is Tris. Jeanine issues an ultimatum; either Tris surrenders to her or she will cause people to die.I enjoyed 'Divergent' so was keen to watch this; I was not disappointed. It might help that I never read the books so aren't bothered by its failure to stay close to the original story. The film is packed with action from start to finish; some of this is 'real world' with obvious dangers and some takes place in simulations which appear to be no less dangerous but allow the impossible to seem possible in spectacular ways. The special effects are very impressive throughout. The cast is solid; most notably
Shailene Woodley who is great as Tris... and looks stunning with a pixie cut! Theo James is good as Four and Kate Winslet is suitably unpleasant as Jeanine. I liked how the film gave us a look at the lives of two more factions, Amity and Candour, as well as showing the factionless as more than just future homeless people. There are of course some flaws; one still has to suspend ones disbelief to accept the faction system and there isn't the sense of danger I'd like... since Tris is the protagonist I never suspected she might get permanently harmed. Overall though I'd say I enjoyed this film as much as he first; it may not have been the most original film but it was more than just sufficiently entertaining. On the strength of this I won't waste too much time before watching 'Allegiant'."

" A pretty consistent sequel to the fist film, both in plot twists, progression, and cliches.
",0.4939,0.9903,2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"If The Hunger Games has given us anything from this uprising of Young Adult film adaptations, it's that each successive film is released in each successive year. There's no waiting for years for the next part of the trilogy to come out, only to have characters cast differently. The Divergent series is no different, but still stands in the shadow of its Hunger Games predecessor.This time around, we get the pleasure of Robert Schwentke directing the post-apocalyptic action. With his previous films like RED (2010) and The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), it's clear he can handle action as much as he can romance. While the action is excellent, the romance seemed to be a little lacking. Having read this book after watching the film, the plots start to diverge a bit (ha ha, get it?) almost in part due to the removal of the more sexually-charged relationship between Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James).Since the focus of the film is mostly on the action, the Divergent simulations were quite visually interesting, with the real-world action almost seeming tame in comparison. Sure, some of the characters, like Peter (Miles Teller) were grating and obnoxious, but unfortunately added to the plot. Some of the trouble I'm starting to have with this series is being unable to clearly see the inevitable conflict of the trilogy. Sure, the ending of Insurgent had some amount of closure in a plotline mostly disconnected from the first film, but at least it led toward something to be used for the plot of the final films. It just really felt like not much had happened between the plot of two movies.A pretty consistent sequel to the fist film, both in plot twists, progression, and cliches, I give Insurgent 3.5 stars out of 5."

This is not the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen, let's be honest, but it isn't that bad as well.This sequel makes sense to me as Tris and Four continue to rebel against evil Jeanine of Erudite which wants to avoid people leaving the circle Chicago is in. It's a whole journey to come to this point and yes, the action-scenes are not all well scripted, but it does make sense to me at least. I mean people complain about action scenes not being totally realistic in any sense, but do people forget what a movie is all about? Don't people have any imagination anymore? Just let the movie continue without paying literally attention to every single detail.The only thing that I constantly find weird (but I guess the character in the book does it) is that Peter constantly is like ""Hey, screw yourself"" and when he sees Tris and Four winning he is like ""Hey, I want to join you"" and this goes on and on continously...Don't get me wrong here. I'm not a reviewer that puts hours into his review of everything he saw in the movie.

" Barbie and Ken in Dystopia!
",0.0,0.864,2019-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Last week, my dear wife and I watched ""Divergent"", which was a predictable and daft but nevertheless endurable dystopian thriller targeted at teenage girls. My wife wanted to see ""Insurgent"" now, even though I tried to persuade her that it's never a good idea to watch a sequel in a series where the original is already just so-so. ""Divergent"" was predictable, which pretty much means that ""Insurgent"" is an open book entirely. Evidently heroine Tris and her lover boy Four are blamed for Evil Queen Kate Winslet's genocide scheme that went awry. Of course they will have to seek help from people they swore never to speak with ever again. And, unmistakably, they will have to reach out to the cowardly leaders of the other fractions and convince them to stand up against the megalomaniac Jeanine and her elite Erudite army. Will they succeed? Gee, what do you think?Okay, maybe I shouldn't sound so arrogant. I'm a 37-year-old male who preferably watches mean-spirited horror movies and obscure cult cinema, so I'm not in the target audience group of Veronica Roth's books or these hi-tech film adaptations. Notwithstanding, the quality level of the screenplay for ""Insurgent"" forces me to think the producers and the director underestimate the intellect of their target audience. Even after the approximately 47th simulation sequence, the writers still think they can fool us into believing Tris' next ordeal is reality, for sure. These simulation sequences are utterly grotesque and preposterous, by the way. We're talking floating houses on fire and dead-mother holograms. And, seriously, what's with all the shattering glass and pulverizing decors? Is this supposed to be cool? Are we supposed to be impressed? All it does is establish that the responsibility of the special effects was in the hands of immature digital nerds. Shailene Woodley still doesn't look like a convincing and brave heroine, not even with her hair cut short, and particularly Theo James must have felt quite ripped off when he got hold of the script. In ""Divergent"" he was a tough and hunky rebel, but in ""Insurgent"" he is downgraded to Tris' docile and obedient sidekick. They are kind of like Barbie & Ken, in fact."

Four is now pointless cause he is there cause he is Tris boyfriend.
all the development they gave Four just went away and he is now this one dimensional character who is just there to support Tris no matter what.
It would have been good to see some conflict with relationship instead of seeing them support each other 100% and love one and other 100%.
It would have been more genuine and real if we see some conflict it dosen't even have to be major it could be minimal.
Tris is this strong depressed woman that's all she is.
She is not as bad anymore but it felt like they showed how Tris dealt with the consequence's and then they just didn't expand on it for certain reasons.
The major events in Divergent are almost irrelevant cause they are mostly forgotten.
And that one dream scene where they showed Tris suffering with the consequence's was terrible.
They straight up said this cringe line ""You killed us all"" just a nitpick.ACTION
I love action scenes specially good ones.
But what i don't like is when an action scene deviates from the story
The action scenes are to much.
It's like every scene needs to have action and it makes the story worse.
instead of giving dialogue to the character they throw in an action scene.VERDICT

",0.7269,0.9837,2018-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Insurgent movie is a sci-fi, action and drama movie based on a book by Veronica Roth . It contaisn noisy action , rhrills , chills , high body-count and impressive state-of art FX . Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a dystopian society divided into five factions. and now she seaches answers in the ruins of a futuristic Chicago. As each faction represents a different way of handling things. Erudite are the intelligent. Candor the honest. Abnegation the selfless. Amity the kind. Dauntless the brave.The Erudite have declared war against Abnegation, because they think that they have important information about the Divergent, who are apparently dangerous for the faction-system. After the earth-shattering revelations of Divergent and beyond the wall enclosing Chicago , Beatrice Prior is running with her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and with her sweetfriend Four (Theo James) from enemies . All of them have to continue her fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear her society apart with the help from others on her side. Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer) , but they all stand away from her. Later on , they meet the Factionless leader and Four's mother, Evelyn (Naomi Watts). Tris faces one impossible challenge after another as she unlocks the truth about the past and ultimately the future of her world. In order to survive, Tris has to make imposible decission about herself and her beloved friends. One Choice Can Destroy You and to finally discover the shocking truth of the world around her .It's a standard Science Fiction with no much sense where there is suspense, thriller, getaways and pursuits , frenetic action , struggles , explosions , violence and enough characterization . Dealing with a girl who is escaping with his fiance and brother from the enemy, while unleashing new secrets about her family's past , hers parents , Tony Goodwyn- Ashley Judd, and her mysterious Divergence . It is a very loose rendition of Veronica Roth's novel, that packs a vastly different screenplay , unlike the first movie . It takes parts of a successful trilogy , in the films ""Insurgent"" is the sequel to ""Divergent"" and is followed by ""Allegiant"" with Allegiant -part 2 being called ""Ascendant"". Whereas there are only actually 3 books in the trilogy. Shailene Whooley gives an acceptable acting as the brave teen who is haunted by her past and takes desperate , risked choices to protect the ones she loves , as well as she must confront her inner demons . Support cast is frankly excellent such as : Ansel Elgort , Jai Courtney , Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz , Ray Stevenson , Kate Wislet , Naomi Watts , Ben Lloyd-Hughes , Cynthia Barrett , Ashley Judd , Tony Goldwyn and Octavia Spencer . The picture contains a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Florian Ballhaus , it was mostly filmed in Atlanta instead of Chicago and being the first film in the ""Divergent"" series to be released in 3D . As well as a thrilling and adjusted to action musical score by Joseph Trapanese . The motion picture was well directed by Robert Schwenke , though Neil Burger was meant to direct this film, but couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with post-production on Divergente (2014). Robert Schewenke has directed a few but successful films such as : The Time Traveler's Wife ,Tattoo , Flightplan , Allegiant and his last one made in Germany : The captain ."
" A good sequel which could have been on par with its predecessor
",0.4404,0.8085,2018-06-06 00:00:00,8,"After the events from the first movie, we follow Tris as she is left scarred from the past events, having more and more nightmares. Once a new hidden box is found by Jeanine, which allegedly contains a message from the ancestors but only a Divergent can open it, a new confrontation is about to emerge. Together with some new allies, Tris and Four must fight once again in an attempt to stop Jeanine.It's a good continuation of the events from the first instalment which presents the two protagonists as they face an apparently new threat from a recent enemy. We're about to see once again plenty of action, emotion and drama, but also unexpected changes and turnovers, all blended in superb CGI. A significant difference from its predecessor is the fact that it tends to focus much more on the emotional part. It insists to present in detail parts of the story which don't involve much action, thus making the first half a bit slow and sometimes dull. Think of it as a somewhat different approach regarding the main plot, which it's up to you to judge if it's for better or worse. From my point of view, it is a bit of a let-down.I was once again impressed by the CGI and the simulations which were top notch in terms of story and implementation, which, with a couple of unexpected characters, managed to introduce something new, something pleasant for the viewer. Unfortunately, not the same can be said about the rest of the movie, which had an overall tendency of lowering the impact which the first movie had. It isn't as impressive as the other one, it isn't as suspenseful and as emotional. You still get to care for the main characters, but this is mostly due to the first instalment. It does little to improve their contribution, and together with the drop in action, you get a noticeable change in the end.I'm not saying that it's a bad movie. No sir. It's just that I had the same expectations from the sequel as I had from its predecessor and this is mostly why I got a bit disappointed. I enjoyed it, I like its story and especially its finale, which once again left room for a sequel, while the special effects are great. I'm just upset that it could have been a better movie and it should have been."

Insurgent is definitely the most action filled though for me, was not as good as the first. Though, be prepared for shocking betrayals, new characters, and a whole new battle. If you want to uncover the secret of this dystopian society, you have to watch the movie and discover the secret for yourself.""We're on the same side, Tris.

" Hunger Games + The Matrix
",-0.25,0.9842,2018-01-25 00:00:00,2,"It is clear these books were rushed out as a copy cat hoping to capitalize on the wildly successful Hunger Games series. The formula was the same. A dystopian future society where people have been arbitrarily divided and oppressed and a young girl who is ready to challenge the whole thing. Hunger Games was much more thoughtful and layered, however. At its core it was a story about totalitarian regimes based on Susan Collins very real experience of living in a communist country as a military brat growing up. Divergent lacked any such layers or depth, but did in some ways make for a more entertaining movie. But at its core it was essentially just a high school coming of age story masquerading as Sci-Fi. You had the high school cliques - the jocks, the nerds, the hippies, the do-gooders and you have Tris Prior who doesn't seem to belong to any one group and is ""factionless"" (which in dystopian future Chicago seems to be the equivalent of having to sit alone at lunch).Divergent also gets points for all of the guys around our female heroine not being totally worthless, Four is quite capable and Peter proves himself to be of some use in Insurgent. But Tris is not going to be content to shoot a bow & arrow from a distance. That more believable combat is traded for Tris routinely beating up men with ease, which always strains credibility. The love story is better in Divergent, as at least our young heroine doesn't fall for a completely useful wet noodle of a guy. My praise ends there, however, as the story at its core makes zero sense. Essentially 200 years ago, founders created an ""experiment"" that they would not live to see the outcome of and apparently expected to fail. That experiment is in full on failure as ""Jeanine"" (has there been a worse name for a villain in movie history?) is seeking to crack down on the Divergents and maintain power over the 3 remaining factions (we did away with 2 in the first movie and yet nobody in the remaining 3 factions seems to think that anything is amiss).But Jeanine is going be challenged by a teenage girl who in true Joan of Arc style (the original Katniss Everdeen) is set to rally an army with her boyfriend Four and the help of his mother, played by Naomi Watts, exactly 16 years older than Theo James. Seems plausible, but not if you age like a Hollywood actress, she looks like his big sister.The movie spends the last half ripping off The Matrix, including the scene where Neo dies, in order for Katniss, er Tris to fulfill her destiny of decoding the founders message. We imprison Jeanine at the end, thus we are 2 movies ahead of the Hunger Games which might explain why there is no box office rationale for the 4th film which would complete the series.Although of course, we can't just imprison Jeanine, because presumably Four's mom now wants to take up the Juliane Moore role of dictatorette.Divergent had enough action and pace to warrant cinematic consideration, but the weak foundation of the series cannot support two stories. Other than getting to live in dystopian Chicago, it is unclear what benefit Jeanine actually receives by oppressing 5 factions of people.As others have noted, the zombie train system makes no sense and for being a totalitarian state, the government in Insurgent is decidedly void of surveillance technology. If you liked Divergent, stop there, leave it at that, and take the wins when you can get them."

My stupid ass didn't think to call a cab so I spent the entire runtime of this movie waiting in the Christing lobby reading the same Cineplex magazine over and over again. Since I had bought the tickets on a gift card, I couldn't get my money back so that was $25 down the f***ing toilet. It was the worst experience I have EVER had in a movie theater and the only movie I've ever walked out of."
" Bland, lazy dystopian sci/fi
",-0.3612,0.9411,2017-11-10 00:00:00,4,"Probably the worst indictment I can give this forgettable franchise is that the only characters with any level of character development throughout the entire trilogy are bad guys and antiheroes. Our heroes, by stark contrast, start off being kind and virtuous and skilled in every conceivable way and thus are never required to grow as characters. I'm not sure if this is a problem in YA writing, film writing or feminist writing, possibly all of the above, but I can't help but notice similarities between the Divergent franchise and the Hunger Games: both of these purport to present a strong female role-model, and yet neither succeed in presenting anything but a petulant Mary Sue who inexplicably finds herself the center of her respective universe. Despite being an uppity go-getter who smashes through dozens of armed men at a whim, Triss is an object: things happen to her not because of the choices she makes but because she is divergent. In this regard Triss, like Katniss is a strange hybrid between the role of the princess and the role of the hero: both the object of the quest as the person going on the quest for said object. The result is muddled story telling without a point, because unlike a classical hero these spunky heroines never really have to grow to prove their worth; as the princess their value is inherent in what they are.Now I could go on to describe how this series features every cliché in the dystopian sci/fi genre, but frankly I wouldn't have cared if the material were competently handled. The operative word being ""if"". Sadly, the introduction to this setting, with its factions and it's bigotry-against-divergents, is done so lazily that you're left yelling ""WHY?!"" at the screen for two films straight before the franchise even tries to answer basic questions about the premise, despite the fact that virtually all the drama stems from it.On the plus side, this franchise had a few interesting ideas, albeit poorly executed, and the visuals were not half bad. Overall though, would only recommend as an exercise in critical film viewing, not as a legitimate film-viewing experience."

Maybe I just ignored that tragic perspective about a sad future of the world where everyone has been put under some kind of 1984esq loss of freedom. The characters were determined to get to the source of the problem and bring resolution, and determination & grit ruled the day. I loved the escape by train scene. Not a bad one."
" A slight step back in the series
",0.0,-0.9815,2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"Insurgent is the sequel to the follow up Divergent released in 2014. There does seem to be more action sequences and stunts both they are repetitive. The entire plot is quite basic, with Tris and Four wanting to find and kill the leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) since she is doing harm to the other people in the factions and such. A running time of slightly less than two hours, a lot of the film contains slightly meaningless scenes of build up or to make up time. A scene featuring them fighting against 'factionless' people on the train was quite well done but at the same time a little silly and pointless. Following the fight, after causing much damage and killing some of their crew, Four tells the leader of the 'factionless' his name then it all stops, because Four was the one they wanted and were looking for. They apparently didn't know it was him but knew of his name. It would have made a lot more sense had Four stated his name prior to fighting. As well with some of the scenes towards the end involving Tris being in some kind of 'simulation' with wires hooked on her, are thought to be interesting, but at the same time more could have been done and less predictable. The effects looked nice.The weak plot, and not much character development is what was holding this film back, as well with scenes that drag on. This film, one can tell feels quite different than the original and that a different director directed it. The style and tone feel a little off and Tris was slightly different. It's as if she didn't care too much about some of the people that were sacrificing themselves for her, and they made her a little more aggressive, angry and confused but in some ways it was expected. Perhaps a little over the top. Insurgent isn't terrible but it's a slight step back from Divergent. Opinions may differ."

Rather bad actors and lots of boring dialogues and ""inner conflict"" nonsense that feels constructed and totally off. Unbelievable dystopia full of logic holes and unexplainable magic devices.Nothing you will remember or wish to see continued."
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.3327,2017-04-29 00:00:00,5,"So...I had this movie since forever in my laptop and since there was no WiFi I thought, well, what the hell? let's get it over with..I have already read the books unlike other people and I gotta say, the movie is even more boring than the books tbh... The only reason I gave 5 is because i REALLY liked Cate's portrayal of Jeanine...her scenes are the only ones that was memorable to me...Four, tris, Caleb- the characters are so one-dimensional, that there should be an award for who was the most one-dimensional of them all... will watch allegiant when I have nothing else to watch AT ALL... like seriously, my clichéd Korean and Chinese dramas are better than this since I go there with the expectations that it will be clichéd but with Hollywood movies I am used to having more expectations.."
" Spot on.

There are a few 'professional critics' giving low scores however if they pulled their heads from their butts they may just chill out and enjoy the film too!The two hours average for each of these films feels about right, enough to establish a story without it dragging on. I would however have been just as happy with another 20 - 30 minutes of content!"
" my favorite divergent series movie.
",0.4588,0.9949,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,I really liked this film a lot. Shailene Woodley does such a great job in this movie! You really go on the journey with her in this film! I loved Kate Winslet and Octavia Spencer in this film. they bring such strong characters into this film and the action in this film is so great. Theo James in this is so great and he is sooo cute!! And I love the relationship between him and Shailene!! This movie is great and I know people have their own opinions about the Divergent films but like with Twilight these are fun and entertaining films. the acting is way better in this than Twilight though. I will always love the Divergent series and I want to read the books.These films are great and I will always enjoy them.
" A slight improvement over Divergent
",0.4588,0.9101,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Yes, this trilogy is definitely not worth investing any of your time in it. That is the fact. However, my seven stars go for the slight improvements in the plot, visual effects and action. Yes, this trilogy started as one of the biggest failure in imitating The Hunger Games, but I think they started to ""diverge"" starting from the middle part of the second sequel. The story started to be much more original and that's why I will give other sequels a chance as well. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the feeling that the whole plot is a bit shallow, there are many scenes when you are just wondering what the hell is this or how did this even happen? Obviously, someone could have done a better job in transferring the book into the movie, unless the book itself is shallow. Remains to be seen.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this movie. The only ones who are completely going to enjoy this trilogy are teenage girls, while they drool over the perfect male super-masculine protagonist. As for the teenage boys, sorry lads, the female protagonist is not hot (at all)."
" Much better
",0.4404,0.9833,2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I found Divergent disappointing but Insurgent is a lovely film.In Insurgent, Triss is showing that she truly is Divergent. Previously, I had complained about her acting in the first film, which I had found to be somewhat one dimensional. In hindsight, I believe it to be very well played and Insurgent shows the full range of the actress' ability.I also loved the music in the film. I might have used rock music myself but I'd have been wrong. This was better. It fit the script and the plot.Now I'm looking forward to watching Allegiant tomorrow.Thank you all for producing such a lovely piece of film. Thank you also for showing that the second in the series does not have to be the worst. Sometimes it can be the best.Indeed...It was also the best book in the series."
