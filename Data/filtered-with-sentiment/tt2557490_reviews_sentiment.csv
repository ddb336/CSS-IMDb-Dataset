Not for kids.Rude and crude.Unexpected

" LOL!!!!!! Funny!!!!
",0.0,0.9726,2021-04-03 00:00:00,10,This movie is funny! Totally just makes fun of the old west! My dad is the guy who has always wanted to be a cowboy as cowboy movies are awesome etc. Well this movie tells the truth about the frontier. It really was not that great and this shows that. This movie just makes me laugh through the whole thing. Plus it is not one of those movies where you need to think hard. You just laugh and have a good time! It is what it is stop expecting more then a silly comedy.
" This is in my top 5 favorite movies
",0.5859,0.954,2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,"This really is in my top 5 favorite movies, and top 3 comedies. I have seen this movie at least 50 times, and I can just put it on in the background and be entertained. Seth MacFarlane is a multitalented artist. Charlize Theron gets to showcase her abilities as a comedy actress. Even the mustache song is hilarious. There is not a part of this movie I dislike because it's so tastefully offensive. MacFarlane and Theron have this magic between them. It's like an old friendship where they can just quip back and forth. Have an open mind and accept the campiness of this movie."

" A million ways to die in the west, an underrated comedy
",-0.34,0.9788,2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"This film stars Seth MacFarlane, who plays the main character Albert, who is a sheep farm man.He met Anna after breaking up with his girlfriend, and many more things happen. I won't spoil it.This is a great stylish western comedy with a good cast. Liam Neeson is great in it (Well he's just playing himself you know).The only thing I don't like about this movie is the long scenes of the two main characters' relationship. However I do not mind because i understand why the writers did those.The jokes are 70% funny for me and it's enough. It's enjoyable, it has it's moments and everything.

",-0.5994,0.9728,2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"If you like nasty humor this is a very funny movie. I had seen this on TV and thanks to a $5 certificate from Best Buy I got this on BluRay for only $5.39. I consider this one of the funniest movies in many years and watched the unrated version that's 18 minutes longer than the regular. The PQ and AQ are excellent, I just wish extras lasted longer. You get 48 minutes worth of extras along with a commentary, DVD and Digital Copy. It was very slow loading and I think started to previews that were downloaded instead of on the disc. I don't know why companies can't just have all movies go straight to a menu and give you as the customer your choices from there instead of forced viewing. I can't wait to watch this again for more uncontrolled laughter now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Universal 4k ultra hd release may 2021"

He is not funny and to be a director it is not the same as to write trash to the Family Guy cartoon, which sucks already by itself.
It's disappointed. The writing it is not creative. The humor it is gratuitous.
This movie wouldn't deserve such actors as Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson. Those ones didn't deserve to have this movie on their portfolio."

" Okay, not Great Though
",-0.3387,0.9893,2020-11-19 00:00:00,5,"I probably can't say that I really did enjoy this film. Sure, it was somewhat cruder than many of the comedies that I have seen in the past, but that seems to be the case with a lot of the comedies that you tend to see these days. Then again, it is a Seth McFarlane comedy, and if you've seen Family Guy, or even Ted, you probably get an idea of what it is going to be about.Basically the film is about this rather nice guy that happens to live on a sheep farm out in the west. He girlfriend decides that she wants to break up with him, namely to have some 'alone' time, which is a nice way of saying that she thinks he's boring, and would rather go out with the mustache guy. Yeah, McFarlane comes across as somebody who really doesn't seem to be all that suited to living in the rough and tumble old west, and the contrast between him, his best friend, and the rest of the inhabitants of the town really does stand out.Still, as I mentioned, it really didn't stand out. That doesn't mean that it was a bad film, but it really wasn't a great film either. The reason being is that it just boiled down to him meeting another girl, who is somewhat tougher, namely because she happens to be married to this outlaw named Clinch, who happens to be played by Liam Neeson (which is somewhat different to a lot of his other characters because here he happens to be playing the bad guy).Of course, we can pretty much plot the course of the film from here, namely that they meet, they get on really well with each other, and then her husband returns and they have to deal with the fact that he really sucks at gunfights, and usually manages to talk his way out of it (which is not going to be all that possible with Clinch).A part of me felt that there was a lot of Blazing Saddles in this film as well, though it has been ages since I have seen it, and I guess that has something to do with with both of these films being off the wall comedies. Actually, it does make me want to go and watch Blazing Saddles again, since as I mentioned, it has been quite a while since I've see it. As for this film though, it was okay, just not something that I considered to be all that outstanding."
" This film shot itself in the foot
",0.0,0.8402,2020-11-09 00:00:00,4,"I'm sure Seth MacFarlane found A Million Ways to Die in the West to be funny. After all, he wrote it, directed it, and starred in it. But what could have been a clever satire of the Western genre instead comes off as a bland recitation of a stand-up comedy bit that tries to shock the audience into laughing by constantly throwing crude sexual jokes at them. This movie had comedy potential, but it shot itself in the foot."
" Certain comic sensibilities
",0.2732,0.8031,2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Not everyone will like or get this movie or its humor. It's kind of like British comedy. If you like Family Guy or some of Will Ferrell's better movies, you will REALLY enjoy this! There are also some surprises like the dance scene, but that's something you would see in Family Guy too. Now you've been warned. You will love this move like I do, or just not. There shouldn't be any surprises."

",0.7003,0.9971,2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"The American West, 1880s. A passive, shy sheep farmer tries to avoid conflict, a trait which has kept him alive but has now resulted in his girlfriend leaving him. She is now with a dapper, successful, extroverted store owner, Foy, a fact Foy keeps reminding him of. When the rivalry leads to a duel, he gets help from an unexpected, beautiful source.Pretty good, and unexpectedly so. I like Seth MacFarlane, largely for The Family Guy (but Ted was pretty good too), but his comedies can be low-brow at times and the trailers for the this seemed to bear that out. Having eventually watched this, I am pleasantly surprised.Quite funny with some of the usual MacFarlane humour: clever, satirical, topical and sometimes over the top. He does resort to some low-brow stuff on occasion but for the most part it quite original and intelligent.The plot is fairly conventional and merely a platform for the humour, but that's pretty much what you'd expect from a comedy.Solid performances from MacFarlane himself plus Charlize Theron, Neal Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson.Good fun."

Great performances by Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman and Alex Borstein, .as for the rest of the cast especially the overweight, sad and tired looking Liam Neeson the least said the better.

Do you like Family Guy yes/no?
If yes you may like this film. (Possibly)
If no you probably won't. (Probably).
If you have never seen Family Guy but have a knowledgeable but slightly twisted but are not offended by humour some consider bad taste in many ways but can see through it because you are intelligent enough to see through it and know the humour is intended to offend those who carry those views and are really the offenders of distateful and offensive or much worse views. Then you may or may not like this film.The film itself I found incredibly amusing, well directed, great at times cinematography, and brilliantly acted by talent who got the humour in the first place.
But humour like this on a film length needs a good story to put it together. Is it very original or predictable? Not really. But the pace of the story is excellent and the strength of the humour is so strong, if you like it, will actually be disappointed when it ends it so amusing.Seth MacFarlane has proved himself as a director in Family Guy, of course a very different media to a feature length film, and proved himself as a director of film with Ted. Of course he acted in that too, if unseen in a way.In this he actually as well as directing and co-writting, acts and takes the lead role. His comic timing is spot on. But his acting also holds the film together. He has done serious roles since and gave a double slap in the face to viewers who think he is not a good actor.That all aside I watched this film many years ago and found it massive fun from the first scene. If you don't like the first scene it is not for you.I love film. Of every genre. If the film is quality. My favourite film is Subway by Luc Besson. But I don't concentrate on one genre. I delve in to all. Sometimes you find just plain bad film. This I did not. It was a joy first time. Probably better second time. Picked up a few jokes and Easter Eggs I missed first time. I only watch a limited number of films more than once. This? In a year or two I will likely watch it again.Know what you are going to watch before you watch it.And I hope you laugh as much as I did and will. A full 10/10. If only i could turn it up to eleven as I would rate it that highly."

",0.5574,0.9848,2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"I seem to be in the minority here and probably a different age group, the upper one. Raised on westerns, my favourite source of drama in films, I have avoided this movie because of poor reviews and poor box office. I watched it last night, mainly to see Charlize Theron and was amazed how much I loved it. It opened with majestic scenes of what I took to be Monument Valley, used to such great success by John Ford in his classic westerns with John Wayne. My thoughts went almost immediately to Blazzing Saddles for comparisons, although it is much cruder but I'm used to that now in modern entertainment. Strangely I don't usually like vulgarity in humour but for some reason I overlooked it in this movie. That may be
due to the likeable performances from Seth MacFarlane and Theron. Amongst all the sillyness is a completely straight performance by Liam Neeson playing his best violent persona which is another reason why I found it worked. I never realised MacFarlane was the same actor who made Ted, which I really didn't like and for me the crude humour in that was everything I don't like about modern entertainment. Why I forgave him that for this picture is a riddle. Still, I really didn't want this film to finish. I loved the relationship build-up between MacFarlane and Theron and the supporting actors, the violent gags and the cinematography were terrific.

",-0.6941,0.9924,2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"Incredibly juvenile, formulaic, and often forced- A Million Ways to Die in the West can make the best of its absurd premise at times, but hardly often enough to carry an entire film for nearly 2 hours. The film feels very dragged out, and even more, the humor is often forced and incredibly necessary at times. It seems there was more dedication to putting lazy written jokes in the film as much as possible, than actually trying to attempt something more humorous, and/or more satisfying. The acting isn't great, obviously this is no Oscar worthy performance film, but Charlize Theron does give her best as Anna in the film, and can provide for some smile worthy moments. The film is moderately and consistently entertaining throughout, but it does tend to feel like it's just a bunch of gags on a string at times, rather than having any true plot or storyline. The gags often become tiresome, and the execution of them are often pretty poor. The film does have some much well executed cameos and references that are quite enjoyable, but nothing to truly make the film itself memorable itself. Instead the film focuses on whatever joke, laugh, and punchline it can get its hands on, without it ever succeeding at anything truly hilarious. It was about what I had expected going in, but even McFarlane fans know that he is better than this. It has some good moments layered without, even a bit of heart towards the end, but it feels more tiresome than truly enjoyable, and is quite a vastly empty film of unused potential. It can be lazy, but also somewhat entertaining, its visuals are nice, but its delivery of gags seems to forced to be truly funny.

" The childish, the idiotic and the vulgar
",-0.7003,0.9971,2020-01-15 00:00:00,5,"""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" is a 2014 western comedy directed by Seth MacFarlane starring him and Charlize Theron. As you may know, I'm a huge fan of Western, one of the oldest and most beloved genres of Hollywood, mostly influenced by the ""Red Dead Redemption"" video games I spent dozens of hours on. I can't even name all the titles I already gave a watch, but sure it was always a massive pleasure. The most fascinating thing about this sub-genre is simply the fact that it takes place in a world with established rules, but still has endless possibilities to create something never seen before - no films is like the other. Now, several years after my fourteen year old me surreptitiously clicked on the trailer and laughed at the ice block scene, I finally got to watch it for the first time. Expectedly, it's nothing but disappointingly cheap fun. For a film that was made by the creator of ""Ted"" I had mixed feelings about what to expect. It could have been either great comedy or unfunny and childish trash. Latter was the case. First of all, the film appears to be a western with comedy elements and not a comedy with western elements. It could not really decide on what it wanted to be and hence the tone shifted from serious to playful faster than Billy the Kid was able to shoot. It was literally in between the two extremes and that's why most of the jokes or dramatic scenes never really worked out properly. The cast therefore consists of versatile actors I wonder what SMF has done to get them in this obviously terrible film. I mean, Liam Neeson was great as usual (can I consider it a life goal I got to see his bottom?), Theron was loveable and even SMF himself delivered mediocre for his standards. The thing is, most of the screenplay was just not hilarious and felt more like a terrible episode of ""Family Guy"" that the producers declined to broadcast. Also, I could not quite take NPH that serious (he just played a costumed version of Barney Stinson) and when I actually laughed it was to the sheer stupidity of it. If there's anything memorable about it, it's the cameos, most memorable the ones of Dr. Emmet Brown and Django and I scream of cheer at how it confirmed that these titles take place in the same universe. But next to this, that film is only mildly entertaining and had a few chuckles. I'd consider it as mediocre fun if it wasn't for the vulgarity and lavatorial humour (why did I have to clearly see the scrotum of a sheep?) that was absolutely embarrassing to the story. In most cases it destroyed the pointe of what could have been a great skit. Oh, and don't get me started about that moustache song. And the hash cookie. Or the Indian drug. Also, why did it have to include an unnecessary and absolutely predictable romance of a subplot between Anna and Albert? Oh, I forgot: To make the movie that already suffers from the lack of originality and interesting plot decisions even longer and painfully stretched to two and a half hours of run time. All in all, I'm honestly saddened to admit that I'm extremely disappointed with the outcome of what easily could have been a classic comedy gem. It had potential, mostly the right actors and what SMF created is just not what I can laugh about. Of course it's naughty, but in an extremely cringe way and way too much of it feels like the film of a twelve year old who tried to mock his favourite western films and took it way too far. It could have been great, but it's just like the relationship between Albert and the bottles: It's a miss."
" Wit and hijinks from Seth, a feature length western comedy ala blazing saddles but not quite its peer
",0.1901,0.9814,2019-12-23 00:00:00,7,"McFarlane gets assists from some great actors, which kind of smooths over his lack of presence as a comedic actor. I think he's brilliant as a writer, cartoonist, creator, and with voices, but as an actor here he comes across a bit too normal, or maybe plain is the adjective. I contrast this with his role as the entitled, egotistical boss in Ted, a more memorable performance.However he has some hilarious deliveries, and his supporting cast do a lot to make the film as a whole fully enjoyable. It put me in a great mood and was fun from start to finish. I thought a feature length film would be tough for McFarlane to pull off, but there was no point where i thought ""enough, already"" or ""where are they going with this"", the whole picture hangs together well.Best Performance was for the character Edward played by Giovanni Ribisi."

" I'm About to Shoot a Full Load!
",-0.4003,0.9956,2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,"A Million Ways to Die in the West is not Blazing Saddles, but as a 21st century homage to the great Mel Brooks classic, it's not a bad effort and well worth a watch.On the debit side, there is no doubting it's a good 15 minutes too long. This is not the sort of movie that needs to be 2 hours in length. Much of the extraneous stuff occurs after Anna has been snatched, in the lead-up to the final gunfight and the pace begins to flag somewhat.It should be said too that some of the jokes fall a bit flat. The movie is not a constant laugh-a-thon. Having said that one has to add, that there are jokes of all varieties and shades in here. Everything is tossed into the mix. Satirical sketches, one-liners, heaps of sight gags, songs, dancing (both people and animals), hilarious, very appropriate and unexpected cameos. No one could ever accuse Seth McFarlane of not giving something a go.For a film of this type, it was greenlit with a relatively large budget and it shows. This is a fine looking film with great location cinematography in New Mexico and vey realistic sets.The cast is just plain impressive and you just feel they had fun making it. Special mention needs to be made of Charlize Theron in a part she was born to play. Besides being extremely cool as usual, she is both sexy and funny and proves again, she is one of those actors, that can just about play any type of role. From this film she went on to steal the acting and thrills credits from everyone in Mad Max: Fury Road and you can see why here.Liam Neeson, complete with his normal everyday Northern Irish accent has huge fun, playing the story's arch-villain, Clinch. As mentioned above watch out for the numerous cameos. They are brilliant, when they come, even when somewhat disembodied. And for dog lovers, the hound who plays Plugger has no lack of canine charisma.In spite of the title A Million Ways to Die in the West is a feel good movie for broad minded people. You'll be guaranteed to feel good after seeing it."

Bloody, violent, almost undisguised swearing and jealousy.2. Is this movie funny? Absolutely funny. Even if it is swearing, it sounds like the right swearing.3. Does this movie let you know about the western United States? Yes, it will be a little bit. For those who can only learn about the American West from movies and games, this is a lively and interesting learning material, although its content is somewhat exaggerated and time-out.4. Is this movie only the above? Do not. The second half of the movie has greatly sublimated it. In the second half of the movie, McFarland played the actor's normal. Although he was still swearing, violent, and incompetent, he did not look different from the beginning of the film. He became a living person, no longer a movie character. . He worked hard, he was timid, he ran away, and he made up his mind. Until he came back, he returned to the town. When I saw his feet into the town and walked into the camera, I was a little choked. He defeated the villain played by Liam Nissen, not by the sharpshooter, but by his wisdom. If you work hard, you will have a reward, and you will improve yourself. This is confirmed at this time. Although he did not become a sharpshooter, he won the cheers and glamour of the whole town, including Anna. If I am 15 years younger, I certainly won't think that this movie is interesting, maybe I will be laughed at by the dirty words in the movie for a while. But now it is different. I think he is very real. At least part of it is like this."

That's from another movie (The Natural) and if only someone had had that talk with a young Seth McFarlane. It's clear he is a gifted voice actor, writer and animator. And yes he can sing and his acting is passable. He just shouldn't do all of these things at the same time! This is supposedly a tribute to Mel Brooks' 'Blazing Saddles' and, to be fair, Mel Brooks' comic sensibilities are an acquired taste as well. (For example 'Robin Hood: Men In Tights' is a horrible film too!) But 'Blazing Saddles' had the magical pairing of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little to prop it up. In 'A Million Ways' you have Seth McFarlane and Charleze Theron (who should get an oscar for ""best supporting good sport""). It also stars Neil Patrick Harris, another boyishly charming actor who wants the world to know he can do it all and arguably Neil can (Gone Girl) but it's still annoying. McFarlane has the time, money and most importantly the need to continue producing this kind of stuff forever. Hopefully, he'll get better at it. But for now, this is his ""Men In Tights""."

It's not as aggressively dark as Family Guy can be but it doesn't white wash anything.I love Macfarland's lovable loser character and seeing him move deal with losing the woman he thinks he loves to the snooty rich guy is a very satisfying narattive with, for once, a very believable romance with two independently developed characters where neither is desperate court the other from the offset but where their relationship develops gradually and I can actually root for this non-arbitrry relsationship.It's sense of humour is thoughtful, creative and irreverant and on top of that there is a real feeling of love for the vintage westerns.I'm so glad Macfarlane is part of popular culture. Even in person he is a treat to watch and listen to.It's gets a bit gross at times and I wish they had toned down the racism of its characters, but I choose to look past that as it's so rare to see a real comedy.There's even a song!"

My brother, a junior national lightweight boxing champion, often fought on the same bills as Liam and got to know him fairly well.
With this film I was expecting another 'Blazing Saddles' but it was not quite up to that level. I found some of the gags just a bit too crude for my liking but Charlize Theron and Liam kept it watchable with sterling performances. Sometimes it seemed a decent straight western and then it would quickly descend into a crude farce. I will never think of Liam Neeson again without picturing that flower stuck in his backside. Now that was funny!"

" Really Funny Alternative Humour... (If you get it!)
",0.54,0.9777,2018-12-11 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a big fan of Seth McFarlane and Family Guy is not my bag either. My pre-judgement made me take 4 years before I would even entertain the thought of watching it. I was expecting some cheesy American humour that I would not really get. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised. So much funnier than I thought it would be. I think because the jokes were dry and in some cases dark. Not far removed from risque British comedy. The chemistry between Charlize and Seth was hilarious and natural. She looked like she had a whale of a time making this movie. Loved the cameos. The film doesn't take itself seriously so you don't have to either."
" Seth McFarlane strikes gold
",-0.3612,0.9864,2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand the 1 star reviews.... Maybe people were expecting something more serious. I guarantee this movie will be a treasured classic in 20 years! Outstanding cast and excellent comedic preformance from all! I think I've watched A Million Ways to Die in the West three times and every time I find something else hilarious that I didn't catch the last time. I really enjoy the references, the cameos, and the overall outlandish death scenes... it's not exactly a spoof, it's not exactly satire, it's Seth McFarlane's own original comedy fest that makes this movie special. I'm really glad this script was green lit, I think it will take a while for people to really get this movie, but overall I give this movie an 8 stars for being a movie I love watching with friends and having a good laugh."

The scenery was amazing and beautiful. After all it was monument valley! This movie did homage to some classic westerns. The scenery and music had moments when you almost felt as if you were watching an old classic.But the gags were humerus, some hilarious, some a bit groan worthy.

" Danger in the West
",-0.5267,-0.9577,2018-10-16 00:00:00,5,"Fresh from the success of ""Ted,"" Seth MacFarlane comes out from behind the camera for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" and gets the acting bug. ""Ted"" is the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time and if he thinks this picture is going to top that, he needs to think again.It's about a cowardly man, Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) who is dumped by his gold-digging girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried). After his attempt to move to San Francisco backfires, he is left with his friend, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman). His life takes a change when he saves a woman, Anna (Charlize Theron) and she teaches him how to stand up for himself. Little does Albert know, she is on the run from her infamous outlaw husband, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson).""Ted"" made well over $500 million two years ago and I would not be surprised if this made no more than $100 million. Just because you have great success with one film doesn't mean the next will be the same and that's where Seth MacFarlane makes a mistake. I'm not saying this picture is terrible, but it's not the greatest or funniest comedy I have ever seen. I started to realize the movie but not be that good as it got closer to release. I figured it would be nothing but jokes and it is. However, it's nothing compared to what Adam Sandler throws at us with brain-dead comedies like ""The Waterboy,"" Mr. Deeds"" & ""Billy Madison."" Seth is known for taking offensive material such as his ""Family Guy"" show and trying to make people laugh with it. I do find Peter Griffin humorous sometimes because he's an idiot, but I find the show stupid because it repeats itself over and over again with the same fart jokes, sex jokes and bodily fluid jokes that are not funny and because it's always the same, it's a pointless waste of time. The idea of this film is that it's based on the old frontier where anything can kill you. This is a good concept, but Seth dumps the film into the same jokes ""Family Guy"" is known for, and it's not funny. It's now clear that he likes to take the easy and cheap route at humour and if that is the case, he's not as smart as I thought he was.It's sad that he takes the lazy way out, but that says nothing about his performance. This is the first time he steps out from behind the camera, and as an actor, I didn't really have a problem with him. This will probably be the only time we see him as an actor because I'm almost sure that this picture will bomb at the box office. He repeatedly points out that anything in the wild west can kill you: cholera, wolves, stomach gas ignited by your own farts and bandits. His characters are smart, and he shares good chemistry with Charlie Thereon, the only other intelligent role in the entire picture. Her name is Anna, and she sees the right heart in Albert and encourages him to be a better man. Now, this is not supposed to be a romantic comedy, but when the two characters share a moment in a romantic atmosphere, Seth feels the need to throw dick jokes in there. Liam Neeson is wasted as a murderous outlaw. We know nothing about this character because there are too many fart jokes that need to be launched instead of giving us a funny comedy that we can laugh at and not feel the same old cheap gags and jokes."
" If You've Only Got a Moustache
",0.0,0.8434,2018-10-12 00:00:00,7,"When you combine Seth MacFarlane with some major stars, you pretty much know what you are going to get: A crude comedy with some great scenes and a lot of scenes that don't work. This film is no different. The movie looks like it might be a spoof of the western film genre, but isn't. Its humor is generated from the crude anachronistic language, similar to Mel Brook's superior film ""History of the World..."" Some of the lines that didn't work were, ""You really shouldn't drink and horse.""Perhaps the biggest downer of the film was that Seth played the lead actor instead of hiring someone like Zach Galifianakis. Now if you don't think there were a million ways to die, Albert (Seth MacFarlane) gives us a head start on the list. The crude Sarah Silverman dialogue was perhaps the funniest part of the film. I always like it when she talks dirty.Fans of ""Ted"" should enjoy this film.Parental Guide: Excessive F-bombs. Sex. Rear male nudity...with a daisy"
" Hilarious - and I hate Family Guy
",-0.25,0.9638,2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I watched this 100% expecting to hate it and ended up loving it from start to finish. The storyline is clever, the jokes are hilarious, and the cast is first-rate. Seth MacFarlane actually comes off very sweet and as a protagonist, he's easy to root for. Theron, Neeson, Silverman and Ribisi are perfectly cast. Definitely give this movie a shot."
" How NOT to make a comedy 101
",-0.2755,0.9963,2018-09-17 00:00:00,2,"Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in The West should be taught in cinema schools, as a textbook example about how not to make a comedy. It has all the ingredients to make a funny film, but manages to do everything wrong, almost never hitting the right button.One, even if it's your baby (that's if you're the writer and director) it's still a mistake to cast yourself as the lead, unless you're right for the part. MacFarlane is not right for the part. He's the kind of guy who, even after watching him in 10 movies in a row, you still wouldn't recognize on the street. The part required a more memorable actor, and more importantly, someone who didn't look as if he was always about to burst into laughter, barely able to hold himself.Two, make up your mind about your target audience. The script has quite a few adult jokes, but they are dispersed between long scenes of unfunny, kid-oriented humour. A lot of recent American comedies have been suffering from this. They are like Disney family movies with an f-word or a phallic reference inserted every five minutes. Make up your mind: Are you making a film for kids? Then remove the language and innuendos. Are you making a film for adults? Then write stuff that will make adults laugh, not 10-year olds. (Like the fart jokes. I stopped counting after the fourth one).Three, when you're able to cast good actors, use them. The film has Charlize Theron, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi (who has the only funny scene in the movie) but none of them have memorable roles, they're terribly underused. All the screen time is hogged by Seth MacFarlane's ever-stable facial expression, for a whopping 116 minutes.Four, never, ever repeat a joke, unless it's in a different context. And I'm not talking about the fart jokes every 10 minutes. I'm talking about the ""people never smiled in the old photos"" joke. It was funny the first time. Not funny the second time. Cringy the third time. And the fourth time, where MacFarlane inexplicably repeats the same joke with such sheer excitement, as if even he himself had never heard before, will make you think ""Is this guy serious?""Five, when you're analyzing past hit movies to give you inspiration, make the right deductions. Blazing Saddles wasn't funny because of the farts, it was funny because it had a solid plot, and the jokes linked to one another (as opposed to unrelated jokes / skits brought together to make a movie) and the characters were well-written.There are some redeeming points, though. The Neil Patrick Harris part with his shop is well written, and Sarah Silverman is obviously enjoying her sexual tirades, but they don't add up to be a funny movie.Overall, this is a huge disappointment, leaving you with no memorable scenes, faces, jokes, nothing. Considering the huge budget and nice cast, it surely could have been much more. But to make more, you first need to write it."

",0.5994,0.1934,2018-09-16 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this strange movie about a coward in the west. For me, I belly laughed several times. It's one of those movies that I will sit down and watch whenever I come across it while channel surfing."
" I love this movie
",0.6369,0.9931,2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"So, it should go without saying that comedy is subjective. I can understand that there are all kinds of people who would say that this movie is not for them. To each his own.That having been said said, if you like Family Guy even a little bit, I would be surprised if you didn't really like this movie.The story was probably just meant to be a bare framework for a million jokes to be told in the west. That said, it's a pretty good story, especially for a comedy. There is nothing more annoying at this point than: boy meets girl; boy throws away a perfectly good thing over something silly; boy 'Harvey Weinsteins' his way back into her life, because stalking makes everything better. As romance goes in movies, comedies or otherwise, this story is completely not in any way annoying.Far more importantly, this movie has the hallmark of the classics. When I first saw it, the obvious jokes were funny, ... really funny. The key though is that on a second, third, fifth, seventh viewing, you notice the more subtle jokes, which are equally, if not more, hilarious.There was not an actor in this movie whose characterizations and lines were disappointing, exactly the opposite. I love this movie even more every time I see it. How on god's green earth could someone not like a movie with Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron , Amanda Seyfried, NPH, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, and on and on, all at the top of their game? On top of which, one written by Seth MacFarlane, who is really good as a non-animated actor.If you dislike the Family Guy, I don't think it should come as a complete shock to you that this movie might not instantly rank on your list of top 10 all-time classics (although stranger things have happened). Otherwise, watch it. Watch it once and, if you aren't completely blown away, watch it again. Give it a little more time, then watch it again. I have a feeling that you won't be disappointed."

Yes it's juvenile and a bit gross and the humour sometimes misfires - it's Seth MacFarlane folks, it is what it is! I personally don't usually like this kind of humour but my Dad was a massive western fan and I watched it because of that and loved the tongue in cheek references/send up of the genre. There are lots of fun moments for anyone who remembers those old westerns, there are lots of silly jokes, a good soundtrack, amusing cameos and the cast are clearly having a great time. It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie overall as long as you don't expect it to be Shakespeare."

It works, it all works, especially if you just watch and enjoy! Seth's acting was excellent! The wit is just constant and flowing and is as fast and rat a tat tat as any gun in the west!! I loved this so I saved it. And I even downloaded the sountrack as I can listen to some of the songs that really made me bellylaugh out loud, especially the theme song!

I eagerly added it to my collection along with those other silly movies I mentioned along with my Jim Carey collection, the Vacations, and it sits right in the comedy section where it belongs witn these other spoofs that we now call classics! who knows, maybe in 10-15 years it will be remembered the same way.

I for some reason missed every movie of 2014 and am only watching them all now. I found this in the DVD bin at Walmart and decided to get it since I love Seth MacFarlane's humour.
It wasn't a bad movie. But it wasn't nearly as funny as the stuff I'm used to by him. It was also way to long for what it is.
I also used to watch My Name is Earl religiously, so was pretty disappointed by Giovianni Ribisi's character in this. And I overall dislike Sarah Silverman.
Anyway, movie wasn't awful, it just didn't live up to Seth MacFarlane's other works."

I think you need to know what to expect going into it. It's similar to a family guy episode. Short quick witted jokes that either land or don't but they move along quickly so it's no big deal. The story get a bit convoluted in the back end of the movie but in true Seth fashion it doesn't matter.Make your own decision in this one and give it a crack

" The best Western comedy ever brought down by juvenile crudities
",0.7717,0.9364,2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by Seth MacFarlane, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" stars MacFarlane as a yella sheep-rancher in an Old West town near Monument Valley. While grieving a breakup with his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) he starts a friendship with a hot blonde stranger in town (Charlize Theron), which isn't good because she's secretly the wife of a notorious gunslinger (Liam Neeson). Giovanni Ribisi plays the sheep-rancher's best friend and Sara Silverman his prostitute fianc√©. Neil Patrick Harris plays the ex-girlfriend's new beau while Wes Studi appears in the third act. If you can look beyond the vulgar potty humor (with WAY too many d-word jokes), this is arguably the best Western comedy, speaking as one who's seen most of 'em. The characters are memorable, the story is compelling and the dialogues are snappy, all with a quasi-realistic tone offset by absurd humor. I laughed throughout even while I winced or groaned at the puerile vulgarities. Theron is stunning and I'm not even a fan (she definitely got better with age). There are a few notable cameos with a great one involving a barn with a mysterious light; and another one at the very end. The Western locations are of the highest order.Too bad it's nigh ruined by the constant obnoxious non-humor.

" Good Western-Comedy!
",0.4926,0.9694,2018-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Seth MacFarlane writes, produces, directs & stars in this 2014 western-comedy which co-stars Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman and Liam Neeson. MacFarlane (Ted, Family Guy) plays Albert, a cowardly, sheepherder who gets dumped by his girlfriend, Louise (Seyfried). He's still in love with her until he meets and befriends, Anna (Theron), an attractive stranger who helps him build self-confidence and fire a pistol. Neeson (Taken) plays Clinch, an outlaw who turns out to be Anna's husband, Harris (How I Met Your Mother) plays Foy, Louise's new beau who taunts Albert, Ribisi (Ted) plays Edward, Albert's pal and Silverman plays prostitute, Ruth who is Edward's fianc√©e. This is a good film featuring a decent cast, silly and weird moments plus cameos. I recommend this and good luck getting the amusing, ""Mustache"" song out of your head."
" A decent, if scattershot, comedy
",0.3612,0.9917,2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'A Million Ways to Die in the West' certainly delivers on what the title promises! For a comedy, there's a lot of death - so much so that it's basically smashing the point over our heads. Set in 1882 Arizona, it's a story about Albert (MacFarlane), wallowing in his sheep farming life on the ""frontier"". It gets better when Anna (Theron) comes along, but there are complications when Clinch (Neeson) arrives. Basically, there's a few Western elements - plenty of shorts of New Mexico/Utah filling in for old Arizona, some tumbleweed and gun duels - but the way MacFarlane talks and acts makes it feel modern (and sometimes as if you're watching 'Family Guy').There are some pretty funny/oddly short cameos - Christopher Lloyd, Ewan McGregor, Ryan Reynolds & Jamie Foxx - whether they add to the humour or detract is up for debate. There's really not much to the story, and it's pretty predictable, so it's surprising that it goes for almost two hours. Plenty of toilet humour, which can be a good thing in small does, but probably goes a little overboard. The main problem is that while there's plenty of good jokes, they're too much like a sitcom and are unable to sustain the plot and sometimes fall flat.'A Million Ways to Die in the West' is not a bad follow-up to 'Ted', but you can't help but feel that MacFarlane bit off more than he could chew here, being star, writer, director and producer. Neil Patrick Harris just plays an unlikeable version of Barney, but the film's main saving grace is Theron, who's funny and charming, as well as Sarah Silverman & Giovanni Ribsi's relationship."
" Profane, Insane, and Inane. Loved It!
",0.3595,0.9423,2017-12-07 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a satire of a massive film genre, American Western movies, and the Old West itself. It mocks and makes ridiculous all the mainstays of those films, which, like all movies, are not historically accurate, and it also has fun with quite a few realistic aspects of life on the frontier itself. For example, in recorded history there are VERY, VERY few instances of anyone fanning a gun (pulling back the hammer repeatedly by running his opposite hand across the top of it), because it made your shots go wild and it was an excellent way to get yourself killed. Similarly, two gunmen meeting at a prearranged time (high noon?) in the middle of the street, much less counting to three or one of them letting the other man draw first, are also Hollywood fantasies, as are conversations between the two combatants, as seemingly happened more and more over time in movies starting with the Psychological Westerns of the 1950s.Just like in Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal,"" which I think most of us were forced to read in high school and we could not get what the guy was trying to say, this movie is not to be taken on face value. The intent is to have a good laugh and to poke fun at certain things about the Old West and its depiction in movies.Yet, there is apparently a reverence in this movie for some of the conventions of classic Westerns. Actor Seth McFarlane, who plays a sheepherder in this movie, is named Stark. Perhaps this is a thinly veiled reference to the main character, Joe Starrett, in the Western classic movie ""Shane""--a peaceful farmer who is threatened by the local cattle baron. Also, did anyone notice that in the center of the main street in the town this movie is set in, there is a large old tree stump? That's equivalent to having a twenty foot high pile of massive stones in the middle of a three lane modern highway. It shouldn't be there for all practical purposes.So why did McFarlane and the other writers put it there? Because such a tree stump is part of a prominent scene in both ""Shane"" and, if I recall correctly, the more recent classic ""Pale Rider"" (starring Clint Eastwood). In both cases there is a scene where the threatened farmer/miner bonds with the gunfighter who is there to help him (Alan Ladd as Shane or Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"") by the pair laboriously chopping out a large old tree stump on his land with axes, when it would have been so much easier to blow it up. Finally, I wonder if some of the stars of this movie were specifically chosen with satire in mind. Neeson and Theron are both foreign born, but are in an American western? And Neil Patrick Harris is the new boyfriend of McFarlane's lost love Louise?"

",0.8687,0.967,2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"This is a very funny movie, even at the very first few minutes. The jokes are mostly spontaneous and really deliver most of the time. Had a lot of chuckles and lols throughout the whole movie. It also has a good story and a happy ending. 10 out of 10 from me, very entertaining ! :D"
" Relies on immature and plain stupid bodily function jokes
",-0.34,-0.9375,2017-09-17 00:00:00,4,"Just not that good, though it follows the trend of big name actors starring in bad movies - how and why I do not know, but here we have Liam Neeson (THE Liam Neeson) and Charlize Theron. They're always great to watch but I can't understand why they agreed to be part of such silly antics. Even if seeing that Sarah Silverman was in this lowered my expectations, I was still surprised at how bad it was.(Spoiler alert) I mean, Liam Neeson falls to the ground and Theron sticks a flower in his butt crack. Really? Then Neil Patrick Harris relieves his bouts of diarrhea in a couple guys' hats, which is disgusting and immature - but wait, there's more! We actually get to see what came out of him. For that alone this movie loses a couple of stars.Come on, people, how low can a movie go? I don't know what's up with Hollywood but it doesn't fail to disappoint. Granted, dumb is the new black so maybe they're just responding to a need for stupid - *more* stupid that is."
" A million ways to tell the same two jokes
",0.25,-0.7471,2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"Seth McFarlane is the new Adam Sandler.That's pretty much all that needs to be said. This movie is terrible, the jokes are few, repeated too many times and juvenile. The core idea of the movie is potentially funny but the writing and execution is simply not good enough. A host of known actors can't save this mess either. There are much better ways to spend your time, even most bad movies are better than this so watch something else."
" A Million Ways to Laugh Insane in the West
",0.2263,0.9789,2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"I liked this movie for the simply executed raw humor. The acting was great and the story line kept you interested providing a somewhat predictable outcome, but you just could be sure. The overall production was very cinematographic with lots of great camera angles. The core to the humor in this movie it the farcicalness of it all. Overemphasizing how the old west was such a wasteland of bad-ass people and harshness. The comedy is beautiful 5th grader to young adult, brash, raw, lots of one liners (I'm 57). Very MacFarlane-ish with old school 60's Batman slapschtick fight scenes. This movie is not for the stuck-ups and people that like to overthink their movies. This movie will become a cult classic."
" Mindless, enjoyable entertainment
",0.4215,0.9455,2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"I'd watch the reading of an obituary if Charlize Theron was in it, but in spite of that, I found myself entertained by the unsophisticated humor and the good performances from some really good actors. This absolutely isn't a thinker-kinda movie, but it is easy to watch and doesn't make you feel cheated by paying the steep price of admission. Appreciate it for its simple entertainment value."
" One of my top favorite movies!
",0.6239,0.9975,2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I actually didn't know much about Seth MacFarlane until I saw the movie Ted. Never was into Family Guy. I'm more of a South Park guy LOL which I know he hates. But after Watching Ted I could not wait to see this movie when I saw the trailer for it in theaters. The only negative I can say about this movie is that there was too much of the greatest moments put into the actual trailer. So that kind of took some of the laughter away because you'd already seen it once. However I admired every bit of this film. The production values, cinematography, music score, the comedy, the writing, and the cast was excellent. I actually get what he was trying to do. And I think his acting was pretty good as well. I think he created a great character and played it just fine. I can even find myself relating to his character with heartbreak which I was going through at the time I saw this movie, and I've been that oddball before. Come to think of it I think I still am LOL. I think the unrated uncut version of this movie was the best. I laughed even harder when I saw that version. If I wanted to create my own Western film, I think I would have done everything the same way. I know he is proud of this film. And I'm sure he doesn't care that this movie has gotten mixed reviews. Some people I've talked to love this movie and some thinks it's stupid. But I'm with McFarland on this one, I'm sure he didn't care about the ratings he just wanted to make his own Western film how he's always dreamed of doing it. And I thank him for that. Because I really enjoyed watching it. Thank you Seth McFarland. Don't let the internet trolls stop you from making more films when they tell you to stick with animation. You're doing just fine as an actor."
" Surprisingly bad film
",-0.3182,0.6805,2017-07-07 00:00:00,3,"Mmm...now here's a curious thing - a comedy that isn't funny, an 1882 western set in the modern day, a star who's a cartoonist rather than an actor. The childish toilet humour will appeal only to 11 year old's and the retarded; the anachronisms from imposing modern day speech, idioms, values and culture on an 1882 setting are annoying in the extreme; love Family guy but Seth is not an actor as is abundantly made clear by this film. In short, a real turkey"
" Inverse Family Guy
",0.0,0.9663,2017-06-29 00:00:00,4,"As pretty much every other review on here starts: Seth MacFarlane is known for his voice work on Family Guy (as well as creating/writing/directing), and it seems odd to see him, rather than hear him coming out from one of his animated characters. And maybe that's why this feels like an overly long Family Guy episode. MacFarlanes character here - Albert - could have been replaced with Brian the dog from Family Guy and delivered most of the same lines, without too big a change in the story. They could have even joked about a dog being a sheep farmer or introduced O'Brian, the sheep that belongs to Peter Griffin's dad. One scene has Albert talking to Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) about ""What is there to live for on the frontier in 1882?"" It goes on so long that I actually cheered when someone else says ""Why don't you shut up?"" I was half expecting the Family Guy rooster to appear and start a massively over the top fight scene, except one of the main premises of the film is Albert not wanting to fight. Edward and Ruth (Sarah Silverman) make a cute/innocent couple, and given her line of work as a prostitute (yep, she gets to talk about her genitals), the set up is: as good Christians they're saving themselves for after marriage. Alex Borstein (the voice of Lois Griffin) has a brief appearance simply to have a discussion about anal sex. Given MacFarlanes apparent need to talk about religion when ever possible (he's an atheist and talking about religion is very important to him), there are plenty of other jokes that go along similar lines. Likewise, you have the standard Family Guy gross out physical humour, including a couple of deaths - the film is called a Million Way to Die in the West - played for laughs.Neil Patrick Harris basically plays the same character he does in How I Met Your Mother, just replacing suits with another crutch. Amanda Seyfried is a pastiche of her previous roles, right down to being lampooned about her appearance in one scene.Wes Studi is yet again playing a stereotype, more in line with Mystery Men than Avatar or Dances With Wolves.Instead of Star Wars references, there's a cameo by Christopher Lloyd (no prizes for guessing which role he's reprising), as well as a comedic pause thanks to Bill Maher, and a couple of blink and you miss them cameos from Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory), Rodney Carrington (Rodney) and Patrick Stewart (American Dad...and other shows), though you can't miss Jamie Foxx reprising one of his former characters.The best characters, are the bad characters. Charlize Theron does a good Annie Oakley impression, while Liam Neeson possesses a particular set of skills, though their actual reason for being in the film does get a little lost behind other relationships.The musical score is good (again, not surprising, given Family Guy uses an orchestra for every episode) and the scenery is stereotypical for the movie old west.I watched it on terrestrial TV, and ten minutes in I was looking to see if Family Guy or American Dad was on on another channel."
" Very Raunchy, Somewhat Funny
",0.4349,0.986,2017-06-20 00:00:00,8,"Seth MacFarlane wrote and directed this film, a very raunchy, yet sometimes funny comedy western. Sort of like a modern Blazing Saddles, but even Mel Brooks wouldn't have appeared! One of the best moments is an homage to Back to the Future, where Christopher Lloyd appears as his iconic character, Doc Brown, complete with the time machine and his famous catchphrase, ""Great Scot.""MacFarlane's acting could have been much better, as it seemed he really wasn't even trying. As for Giovanni Ribisi, he was not too bad, his character, like himself, was flawed. And Sarah Silverman's character was terrible and disgusting, more so than needed! Neil Patrick Harris played an arrogant, self centered person, and he was great. He stole the scenes he was in, especially the gun fight in the street, too hilarious. Liam Neeson did a great job too, even though I'm not particularly a fan. His deep Irish accent was a great touch.Overall, it wasn't a terrible film, it will make you laugh, especially at inappropriate times. That's what Seth MacFarlane lives for! Not for anyone too immature, but just a little."
" Seth McFarlane's Lampoon Of The Old West
",0.0,-0.6472,2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"As with any Fuzzy Door production, there is one disclaimer that needs to be made: Seth MacFarlane has a very specific brand of humor (think Family Guy, Ted, etc.). If you don't like that wise-cracking, making-fun-of-everything style, than stay away from this movie. Stay far, far away. If that kind of humor appeals to you, however, then I think you'll find this an entertaining experience.For a basic plot summary, ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" centers on Albert (MacFarlane), a sheep herder in the Old West of 1882. As the movie begins, Albert is depressed after losing girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) to the mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). Desperate and fed up, Albert is about to head out for San Francisco until Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into his life. The only problem? Anna just happens to be married to Clinch (Liam Neeson), the fastest gunslinger around who also happens to be a very jealous man.The reason this movie works well is that one can tell MacFarlane carries with him a respect for the Western genre. That is what many people do not understand about his type of humor...it is all in fun! It may be mean-spoken, but it isn't mean-spirited by any means. Included in this film are all the trappings of a classic western, from the rousing soundtrack to the period costumes to the stereotype characters. What MacFarlane does, though, is make fun of them all! He has it in particularly for the fact that so many things can kill you in the Old West (hence the title of the film).This movie isn't nearly as good as ""Ted"", MacFarlane's previous effort, mainly because all the really good material seems to be used up about an hour or so into this one. The ending (while still providing a few laughs) is not nearly as satisfying as the setup, where secondary characters played by Giovanni Ribisi, and Sarah Silverman are really allowed to shine next to the primary folk. For that reason, I'd give this an exact rating of 3.5 stars, but I'll bump it up rather than down because I did have fun watching it.It comes down to this: If you like Family Guy and/or Ted, I don't see why this one would appeal to you any less. Not an all-time classic by any means, but just Seth MacFarlane given free reign to lampoon the Western as he sees fit."
" Not So Wild West - Not So Funny Either.
",-0.3865,0.9948,2017-02-28 00:00:00,5,"This is one of the many movies where the trailer is better than the film because it eradicates all the superfluous parts, which in this instance is a lot.The concept of the story should have allowed for a variety of humour but once again the writer decided to stick to puerile adult toilet humour. Don't get me wrong, I like this kind of humour and some of it does make me guffaw, though I find many ""Comedy"" films are relying on it too much and this commonplaceness turns it stale.Seth MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild, also seem to run out of these type of jokes and try to extend them until they become cringeworthy and dullened. The point in case being Giovanni Ribisi's character Edward and his relationship with his fianc√© Ruth, played by Sarah Silverman. Edward and Ruth are truly in love and are waiting to get married, in the eyes of God, before they celebrate their love conjugally. The problem being that Ruth is a whore in the saloon, who does the best business in town. This conflict is funny when first used, though by the third time it's starting to wear thin, then it just isn't funny anymore. These writers know how to kill jokes (another way to Die In The West).However, credit where credit is due, the planting of the flower is pretty funny.Though some of Seth MacFarlane's jokes fall short his directing skills are pretty solid as he does more than a decent job throughout.There's some serious acting talent in the film, though I do feel as though the characters could have been a little stronger. The main bad guy, the gunslinger Clinch, played by Liam Neeson, doesn't come off mean enough. He should be somebody to be scared of but he isn't. Charlize Theron, who plays Anna, should've been a lot tougher than portrayed. The west was a savage and dangerous place and she was Clinch's woman. The only characters which come out of this film correctly are Seth MacFarlane, who does a decent act as the cowardly farmer, who doesn't farm, Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman who do well adding a depth to their characters. Even though Neil Patrick Harris does a decent job with the character of Foy, it does seem to be very similar to other characters he's portrayed - and the moustache song... really(?) Though, the decent acting ability and direction cannot make up of the dullness of the script, missed opportunities to be funny, and overused and tiresome jokes.Unless there's nothing else worth watching I would stay away from this dud of a movie."
" I Didn't Even Watch It And I Hate It!!!
",-0.6784,0.9212,2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Yeah. Bad bad bad. I saw a review of this movie by ralphthemoviemaker on youtube and WOW does it ever stink! He showed some scenes from the movie and they are painfully unfunny. Seth isn't magnetic or charismatic in the least. None of the dialogue seemed to have any spark and definitely zero humour. The cinematography isn't terrible, but other than that, it's a complete waste of time. It's way too long, too dull, too unfunny and the best advice I can give to you is to STEER CLEAR from this stinky mess!Pity, because I love Family Guy and find a lot of Ted to be quite funny."
" MacFarlane's ego takes centre stage
",0.0,0.9193,2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Being accustomed to the disjointed narrative and toilet humour of Family Guy, I was pretty positive that content of a similar nature would be present in this film. Sure enough, I was right. But what I found the most insulting about this film is just how uninspired and boring it is, once you really look at it.MacFarlane plays a complete wuss living in the Wild West. Already it is a clich√©d fish-out-of-water story. His girlfriend has left him for a more classy gentleman and he proceeds to act like a cynical jackass for the majority of the film.Liam Neeson plays a bandit (also the only person in the Wild West with a Northern Irish accent) and orders his wife (Charlize Theron) to wait for him in MacFarlane's village. She spends time with MacFarlane teaching him to become more masculine and to adapt more in the current setting. She also teaches him to stand up for himself. So, obviously MacFarlane falls for her and they fall in love, although conflict arises when Liam Neeson comes back. Ultimately, good triumphs over evil. The end.There is no attempt to make this plot seem engaging. The amount of wasted actors in this film taking a step back just so MacFarlane can stroke his ego is just not fair. Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris, Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi? This impressive cast has to humour MacFarlane as he simply tries and fails to act? Don't get me wrong, the guy's talented as an animator, singer and voice-over artist, but as far as acting in live-action goes, he misses the mark here in every possible way."
" Is this supposed to be a comedy?
",0.3612,0.2683,2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"""A million ways to die in the west"" is a movie that suffers from four major problems, all of them closely connected.1. It is produced by Seth McFarlane, who obviously is unable to select a capable crew. 2. It is written by Seth McFarlane, who obviously is very infantile and not funny at all. 3. It is directed by Seth McFarlane, who has no talent for directing and editing. 4. The lead character is played by Seth McFarlane, whose acting skills are absolutely undetectable. Lucky for him, judging from his ultra-smug appearances on various talk shows, his ego does not seem affected by the above facts.I must have seen at least a couple of dozen really awful movies through the years, but none as bad as this one. Avoid, please!"
