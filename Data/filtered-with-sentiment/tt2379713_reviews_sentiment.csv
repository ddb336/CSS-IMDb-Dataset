" Falls Into The Batman Trap
",-0.3182,-0.9701,2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"I understand that series have their characters, Joker, The Riddler, Blofeld.But...it does get a little boring and repetitive. What is wrong with old franchises introducing new villains or new evil organisations? Why do we need to beat to death the same ole same ole?This is my main disappointment with this entry, its lazy writing and lacks creativity. Where is something new for the fans? How many Jokers do we need? Here is a creative idea, why not have done a crossover to Bourne (or Jack Ryan) and have an Operation Blackbriar with an interfering agency from another part of the spy world? Something New!!!!Outside of the sameness the rest of the action etc is the usual high standard."
" Why all the hate ?
",-0.5719,0.4215,2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,Yet another outstanding bond movie . Daniel Craig will be missed.
" Yawn,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
",0.0,0.9666,2021-03-11 00:00:00,5,"I have watched every Bond movie since the age of 4. I used to think From Russia with Love was boring in 33 years have never watched beginning to end, I'm a Moore era fan. Spectre is by far the most boring Bond outing. It starts out good, has a good song from Sam Smith, after the credits falls flatter then Jaws on the big top in Moonraker. Bond goes from location to location, a few over the top action scenes, boring dialogue, a flat lining Bond girl, a dull Blofeld, with possibly the worst twist of the franchise. And couple scenes with what the writers thought was humour. I wish Maibaum hadn't passed away and still wrote in collaboration with Michael G Wilson, they had good solid scripts. It's 2.5 hours of watching beige paint dry. Believe it or not it isn't the worst film though, that honour is shared with two Brosnan era flops. DAD 2002,TWINE 1999. I think Skyfall should have been it for Craig. It's time for a more traditional type Bond film again, with a sexy lead. I'd love to see Chris Hemsworth as Bond."
" OO7 is finally here (A masterpiece and a reward for Bond fans)
",0.8316,0.9832,2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Let me start by saying that even though I am a huge Bond fan, for some reason, I was not impressed by Craig being cast, and almost gave up on Bond after Royale.(Silly me.)But! Thanks to pandemic, I decided to binge these movies and see what this ''new'' Bond is truly all about.I was so wrong, wrong like Bond never is. Even though the movies put a new spin on the series by introducing a serialized and sequelish narrative that was not seen before - that particular escapade actually gave these movies so much power.And that power culminates and explodes in Spectre.Rebooting a franchise is usually done instantly after the opening credits. But for a franchise that lasts this long, and that is beloved by many across the world, it had to be handled with great care and over a course of a handful of films.From the first Bond's mission after he gets promoted to OO, through scars earned in Quantum of Solace and his death and redemption in Skyfall, OO7 in Spectre is finally all grown in his true and unstoppable form that we all know and love.While viewers and reviewers of Spectre usually address his true form as simple love letters or nods to previous films, they fail to see the whole point and character development that we had on screen before our very eyes, and that was done masterfully by mr. Craig.In Skyfall, the classic M was slowly rebooted and brought back to old office as well as Miss Moneypenny (not to mention Q, Aston Martin DB5, etc), and in Spectre, our Sean Connery era Bond, is finally ready to steal the show.However, this time around, he makes so much more sense, because we had a chance to see all that slowly-built and shaken-with-a-thin-lemon-peel-slice character development in previous (Craig-era) instalments.Daniel Craig's savageness and confidence is now matured and has a fine coat of absolute charm that allows him to steal a true and intoxicating B(L)ond Girl who apparently is not in a dire need of hand-to-hand combat lessons.Spectre is like a box of pralines in a lavishly redesigned package sent with care to all fans of all Bond eras, just to be stolen and eaten - by the second half of the movie - by a classic Bond villain. (Thank you mr. Waltz for doing what you do the best.)And, just like that, all that I have concluded above has been shown in first seconds after the MGM logo sequence, when we finally and for the first time, get to see the full classic intro with the classic Bond theme. And that alone gave me the chills.Just don't tell me it was put in Spectre for the first time for no apparent reason. :) It's because both we, and our Bond were finally ready for it.So, should you watch it? Let me see:Aston Martin, white tuxedo, Monica Bellucci, a train, a crater in the desert, menacing Dave Bautista, and a white cat...I'll let you think about it while I go and make myself a Martini... But this time, dirty."
" High on action, low on script still entertains
",0.3182,0.9795,2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Spectre is an action spy movie directed by Sam Mendes and stars Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Winshaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes .This is twenty fourth bond movie and fourth to star Craig.I have read lots of negative comments about this movie but in my opinion this is an entertaining action movie with reaching into it's past.This movie will give you feeling of vintage bond movie made in today's time with some of the scenes picked and remade into a new movie.The story and the plot is little disappointing and has leaks and loose threads which weren't knitted properly. The execution weren't that impressive and might disappoint.Acting is good but somehow I felt that Waltz could've been utilized more considering his talent. Rest all the characters were good.Action scenes are the most strongest pillar of the entire movie and will entertain you. Locations used and great and captured beautifully. Climax is average.In my opinion I would rather suggest to watch the movie and don't go by the reviews. It's a good movie to watch."
" Hackneyed and Embarrassing
",-0.3818,-0.9189,2021-03-06 00:00:00,2,"Early in the movie, by the time Bond cozies up to the widow, I thought I was watching something so badly written that surely there'd be some kind of clever turnaround (even an unclever one, like it was all a dream so far). But nope, the movie continues (and continues and continues and continues) to be quite poor in many dimensions.I've seen the odd Bond film that I didn't think was very good, and it's not like I have a great memory of all of them (some I haven't seen in half a century or so), but I'm fairly certain this might be the worst one ever.A quarter of a billion dollars to make this stinker - and most of it went to things I do not care about one iota.Will the powers-that-be see the error in their ways, and learn that script is the most important part of a movie, and so the next Bond film returns to good form? Or will it be like when Batman Forever was such a terrible movie, yet the very next one (Batman and Robin) was even worse?The stars I did give are for Q and the mouse."
" The name is Bond, James Bond
",0.0,0.8176,2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Out of all the bond movies they filmed with different actors playing James Bond like Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, George Lazenby and Pierce Brosnan, I will say that Daniel Craig is the best so far"
" From Casino Royals The Daniel Craig Bond Rebirth completes itself phenomenally
",0.0,-0.9683,2021-03-05 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea how many Bond Geeks on the level of Star Trek there were.
Craig is separate as marketed and clearly evident as he is issued 007 status. Bond films being over the top, light, more balanced all have reminders or similar type of scenes. I was reading that the train fight with Nixt (Bautista) was reminiscent of From Russia with love, which it clearly wasn't. The only thing in common was a fight on the train. In Live and let die there was a closed combat fight at the end on a train. He's a spy and From Connery through Moore there was always a Nemesis coming after Bond after a successful mission. Nik Nak, Jaws, Goldfinger himself, The Iron claw side kick in Live and Let die, The Former head of Russian intelligence in From Russia with Love...and the list goes on.
Depending on the script will give a tone to a particular Bond...
The Goldfinger Austin Martin was in Thunderball, The Goldfinger, the opening of her Majesties secret service, the opening scene of Goldeneye, Casino Royale won in a poker game, and in Skyfall. (All the Craig films had an Austin Martin model car).
Bond has felt affinity and a mourn-fullness in many Bond films, Jill Masterson in Goldfinger, Vespa, his wife, Terri Hatcher, etc....
Despite reminders of the Bond formula this was the First Craig filled with all sorts of Reminders like Goldfinger's Roles Royce, the eye of Blowfeld, the exaggerated torture (though Craig is the first Bond to be tortured). Craig was like Christian Bale was to Batman. There were allusions in the first three that they were connected to an ""organization"" SPECTRE, and it gave me a greater appreciation for Quantum which I initially was disappointed by. Part of the problem being spacing and Marketting. 5/6 Bond films Connery went up SPECTRE or SPECTRE underlinks. On.y Goldfinger was the megalomania unrivaled by all of Moore's with the exception of Christopher Lee.
Because of Tech there are more digs at Bond and cracks about his age, and the question of that kind of espionage being obsolete. There are jokes about his former over the top toys as well.
But every Bond film has a tribute or similarity to a previous Bond film. Even a quantum the agent found covered in oil reminiscent of Goldfinger and skin affixation. Bautista was a former WWE beast and difficult to kill but he was not a reminder of Odd Job or Jaws, or the Claw.
The first three definitely had a darker mood to them, paranoia as to who he could trust, some self doubt and vulnerability, fear, something nor present in any previous Bond film. At the same time humor was maintained and increasingly over the top action scenes with today's effects especially in the over dramatized SPECTRE and adding to the story what I only saw in Austin Powers that Blowfeld was his foster brother... making part of Blowfeld's drive a Cain and Abel story and obsessive.distraction from his massive criminal enterprise. Through the 4 films discovering the threat of SPECTRE and those who were deemed respectable tied into SPECTRE was also on a higher level for the audience.
I thought on a Bond Scale and as a Bond rebirth Craig, the writers and directors did a phenomenal job rebooting Bond, as opposed to substituting the actor as was the custom From Dr. No through Die Another Day."
" It just doesn't feel like a James Bond film
",-0.2755,0.9504,2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Generally speaking, not a bad film and I could say that I enjoyed it. Some scenes were a little bit monotonous, some scenes were interesting. But compared to the other films from the franchise, including Bond films starring Daniel Craig- it's not that good.
It was too depressing for a James Bond film.
I understand that everything changes, so does filmmaking. And I am not trying to say that new films should try to imitate older films but it just has a lot different atmosphere than previous films from the franchise. For instance I like Craig's performance in Casino Royale - he was a serious and a daring Bond but he wasn't depressed.All in all, not bad but in my personal opinion, producers should return to the more positive mood like most films actually have."

Love the long shot at the beginning and the other amazing uses of camera, complete and understandable development of plot, equally breathtaking action scenes. Spectre's mainly focused on introducing the character Madeleine Swann and Bond's new relationship, as well as the growth of M (aka Voldemort). The villain isn't as intimidating as Javier Bardem's character, and his motivation isn't convincing, and personally I didn't enjoy connecting all previous films with just one organization, which undoubtedly failed at the end."

" An Honest Review
",0.5106,-0.7868,2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"The word ""convoluted"" comes to mind, as does the word ""unwatchable""By the time Spectre came out, I was honestly sick of Daniel Craig's James Bond hates being James Bond depiction. And now I've come to really despise him, I mean Moore used to be my least favorite Bond, and I like him so much more than Craig.But... the script was kind of all over the place. I think they were trying to do twists and turns, but they were stuck under steering with each turn, so all the twists they tried to throw at you never really worked. It ended up feeling like they were trying to be confusing for the sake of being confusing, and didn't know how to make it all feel confusing for the sake of being mysterious.I mean Christoph Waltz is a great actor, but even he couldn't find his footing in that mess of a story.The action was never suspenseful or even really enjoyable...... and it all leaves you with the feeling that this is a Bond movie made by people who forgot how to tell a story. And that is kind of fitting given that is what Sony seemed to be threatening to do with Bond for a while, and it was 2015, just before the Hollywood Era of ""story and characterization don't matter""It can only go down hill from here."
" Tempus Fugit... isn't it funny how time flies?
",-0.3412,-0.2868,2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Right from the very beginning of the film at the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico, to Westminster Bridge in London at the end, this film proved to be a spectacularly epic action/adventure film. It is beautifully delivered and really packs a punch. It sparkles in all the right places and at times becomes a love letter to the Bond films of the past. I like to be entertained and this is really an entertaining film from start to finish - one that is laid out to the audience and does not really need to much understanding. Despite the positives though I do have some negatives, and they are centered around the story and the unfolding of the plot. The main negative being is that there is not really anything new or clever here. Bond is on a revenge mission that his superiors are not happy about. Somebody from the past wants revenge against Bond. The threat to the world once again is technology and information. While Raoul Silva in ""Skyfall"" was an out-and-out cyber-terrorist (although we never see him at a computer properly), this time we have the mastermind behind a terrorist organisation whose globally threatening plan is, (drum roll please) a spying/information network over the world - so yeah, he's basically in charge of a cyber-terrorist organisation. Hang on though, hasn't that been done? Hasn't it been featured in a Batman film, a Captain America film, ""Enemy of the State"" as well as various other films over the years too? I am certain it has. There are other plot holes and issues throughout that, if you are fan of all the films, serve to confuse a little - for example: in ""Skyfall"" it's claimed that Bond grew up with Kinkade in Scotland... but in ""Spectre"" he grew up on a snowy mountain being looked after by Oberhausen. In the last film Q claimed that MI6 do not really go in for silly gadgets like exploding watches... but guess how Bond escapes Blofeld... yeah, an exploding watch. I could rant on and on, but I will not, I will just sum it up by saying that this is a fun and action-packed film. It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It is better than ""Quantum of Solace"" in my opinion, probably on par with ""Skyfall"", but nowhere near as good as ""Casino Royale"" which for me is the pinnacle in Daniel Craig performing as 007 so far. While he was initially going to hang up his tuxedo after this film he's signed up to one more film in ""No time to Die"" (due for release in 2021), so I'm hoping that he gets an adequate send off in that, and he doesn't end up getting a farewell like ""Die Another Day"" did to Brosnan."
" Goodbye, James Bond.
",0.0,0.9912,2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Spectre is much better than I recall and almost among the top tier of Bond films.The opening sequence is okay, the song's no good, but the credits are pretty decent. The story's strong and it's consistent with great action sequences. Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista both excellent, Waltz as Blofeld and Bautista just a brute force. The amount of times they had Bond and could of just shot him is cartoonish though, heh. Fiennes is actually no better as M than Dench, doesn't take as much screen-time though. The Bond girls are lacking, Seydoux's okay, Bellucci's good briefly. The run-time's long, but never dull. I'm no Craig Bond fan, but it's good."

" The writing's on the wall?
",0.0,0.9959,2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"I have been a hugely devoted James Bond fan for 15 years, so I thought a review of Spectre would be an appropriate point of departure for this film review blog. James Bond really is my raison d'être - I have owned the entire film collection alternately on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray over the years, and I am an avid collector of 007 merchandise. As a fan, perhaps I am biased in saying I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though this review will not be without a few criticisms for the sake of being open-minded.Spectre continues in a similar vein to Skyfall, unsurprising since this film retains director Sam Mendes and some of the cast from the preceding film, such as Ralph Fiennes as the newly-appointed ""M"", Naomie Harris as ""Moneypenny"", and the ever-faithful Rory Kinnear as chief-of-staff ""Bill Tanner"". It feels as if the Daniel Craig saga is finally finding its feet, after a long period of experimentation. Casino Royale was gritty and realistic, dispensing with most of the traditional Bond humour; Quantum of Solace acted as a sequel to Casino Royale - something that had not been done with Bond before. Moreover, Skyfall was a new chapter in the Craig era, in which staples of the Bond formula were somewhat restored, including the British humour, a vintage style of dress, and a larger-than-life nemesis in the form of the excellent Silva, played by Javier Bardem. However, Spectre is a different type of Bond film again, in that this film ties up the threads of all the previous Craig films. (It is unsurprising, therefore, that many speculated this would be Craig's last outing as Bond).Spectre opens with a thrilling sequence in Mexico City, to which the backdrop is the famous ""Day of the Dead"" festival. There is some spectacular camerawork here, with careful tracking shots following the action of the parade. The action really takes off, however, when Bond is chasing the baddie, Marco Sciarra, through the cluttered streets before they both jump into a helicopter. In true Bond fashion, what ensues is a spectacular fight sequence. I was rendered breathless by the fast editing as the helicopter dived and swooped above a frightened crowd. As the helicopter ascended into the sky, I felt pressed into my seat, a moment complemented by a familiar excerpt of Thomas Newman's score from Skyfall. Naturally this thrill ride of an opener is followed by the intricate opening titles over which plays the theme song - this time around it's Writing's On The Wall by Sam Smith, a song with much emotional depth, but one which I had to listen to several times before really appreciating it.From then on, the film never lets up, taking us to several stunning locations, including Italy, Austria, and Morocco. (Of particular note is a beautiful long shot of the train, on which Bond and his love interest, Madeleine Swann, are travelling, as the sun is setting. The Bond women are well-played, decidedly modern characters. Monica Bellucci plays Donna Lucia, the mysterious widow of the recently deceased Sciarra, and Lea Seydoux is the beautiful and independent daughter of Bond's old opponent, Mr. White.Daniel Craig, naturally, has subtly changed his characterisation of Bond over the years. However, he has now found a nice balance between Sean Connery's animalism and Roger Moore's humour, with his own inimitable style thrown in. I do believe, however, that Mr Bond has met his match with Christoph Waltz's villain, Franz Oberhauser. Waltz really steals the show with his interpretation of the classically cold, sexless Bond villain.The principals are ably supported by Ralph Fiennes as ""M"", showing a refreshing return to the legacy which Bernard Lee left. (I was impressed by the way M's leather-padded office was lovingly restored for this film.) Ben Whishaw returns as the young, whiz-kid incarnation of ""Q"", and, of course, we have Naomie Harris as the sultry ""Miss Moneypenny"".In my view, Craig is second to Connery in the role. Spectre is rather tongue-in-cheek in places, and a far cry from the no-nonsense Casino Royale. I think there is something of a risk in making Bond, as a franchise, seem in some ways a parody of its former self.However, the Bond producers are far too smart to allow this to happen. To sum up, Spectre is classic, fast-paced, stylish, and further ensures the longevity of the Bond series. And long may it continue!"

" long
",0.0,-0.9939,2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,"This movie is too long for my taste, the story is not original. And my problem is how isAt the helicopter scene at beginning, Bond was trying to take out the pilot, I was like ""what are you doing man?"" If he killed the pilot wouldn't all of them crash and kill even more people? Luckily he managed to miraculously do it.
Bond didn't sustain any injury or even a scratch after that train fight with Bautista, I thought all the bones in his body would break but they didn't, after the fight he even continue to make out.The villain is underused, at first he was introduced in the most fearful way possible but it turns out he just an ordinary guy who is jealous of Bond because they shared the same father once and the father happens to give Bond a lot of attention and he was telling Bond all that while torturing him, if he ruined your life that much just go ahead and killed without the stupid talk.
How the hell the Blofeld survived that blast? Not to talk about the one with the watch. He only has a cut in his face that goes through his eye and it was painful to watch.The ending was somewhat anticlimactic and disappointing and cliché."
" Phantom Menace
",-0.4939,-0.9822,2020-09-08 00:00:00,5,"There's an idea that alternate Daniel Craig Bond films fluctuate in quality. The excellent ""Casino Royale"" was followed by ""Quantum of Solace"". The similarly good ""Skyfall"" was followed by this, for my money, a disappointing and unoriginal addition to the franchise. (Bodes well for ""No Time To Die"" though.)After receiving a cryptic message from the late M (Judy Dench), James Bond (Daniel Craig) follows a criminal's widow to infiltrate a meeting of the criminal underworld. There's he's introduced to Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who informs him that he's the mastermind behind the villains of all Bond's recent adventures. Meanwhile the mergers of MI5 and MI6 have M (Ralph Fiennes) pushed out by C (Andrew Scott) who favours technology and drones, over the 007 program.The analogy that pops into my head for ""Spectre"" is that it's like going to see a cover band, you can recognise the moments, and for all intents and purposes they're just as spectacular, but it's not the same. So whilst it's just as good on paper, with its world traversing plot, I found ""Spectre"" a hollow experience. I wonder if it's got something to do with the fact that the villains of it aren't clear in their specific aims. Controlling criminal activity isn't as immediate as revenge, or an act of terrorism. Blofeld says that he's been controlling everything that's happened to Bond so far, but it doesn't ring true as there's no loose ends in those films that conceivable could have been him, and though I haven't seen all of them in a while - doesn't Bond generally have to hunt them down?It's not a disastrous film, by any means, the opening scene is OK but it's a lifeless entry, with a terrible theme song."
" It seems that the film makers still haven't learned their lesson about casting. Why is Daniel Craig still playing James Bond?!
",0.2714,0.9442,2020-08-29 00:00:00,2,"""Spectre"" (2015), it's about time I wrapped up these four lousy excuses for James Bond films. Yet, they're making a fifth film with Daniel Craig! Why? To say that he sucks as James Bond is an understatement. Once again, I hate to even call this ""film"" a Bond movie because of one issue, Daniel Craig. We'll get to him later, but, let's get back to my review. This ""movie"" has a very predictable and boring story, standard to terrible acting, dull sets/locations and a generic cliched soundtrack. The storyline is all over the place, and the inconsistent tone really shows on the screen. Unless that's the idea for the plot, then it will never work in the context of film. This storyline had potential, but it was marred by poor script writing and direction. There is actually one good scene, the train fight between our main character (I hate to call him James Bond) and Hinx, played by Dave Bautista. That was a homage to the far superior Bond film, ""From Russia with Love"" (1963). You know, that's kind of sad if you think about it. The best part of this ""movie"" is a homage to a different one. Wow, that just shows there's a problem, when you can't get the audience interested in your movie and have to remind them of a much better one. To be honest, that's the only interesting scene in this ""film""! Now let's get to the acting, I honestly have said all I can say about Daniel Craig's butchering of James Bond. What else can I say, other than he sucks as the character? Throughout the course of his four movies, his performance just consistently got worse and worse. There are two fundamentals in proper casting. It's one thing to be able to act the part, but the actor/actress must also look the part. Daniel Craig has none of those qualities as James Bond. Need I remind you that when they were casting for ""Casino Royale"" (2006), hundreds of actors auditioned for the role? Out of all the actors to pick, they had to pick him. They must have truly been desperate to find someone! As for all of the other actors and actresses, they are mostly standard to mediocre at best. The best performances come from Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Ralph Fiennes as M. Even Judi Dench's portrayal as M on a monitor was honestly more believable than most of the other characters in this ""movie""! As for the sets/locations, most of them do work. You cannot go wrong with areas around Europe. But, some of them are just simply boring! In particular, Blofeld's desert base where Bond is tortured. I love seeing Daniel Craig's sorry excuse as the James Bond character getting tortured, even though it's not real. Finally, the soundtrack is overall a jumbled mess. Well, I suppose inconsistent storytelling equals inconsistent film scores! The only positive thing in this ""film"" is the special effects, all of them were well-done. Being a movie made in 2015 that doesn't surprise me! ""Spectre"" is the third worst Bond film with Daniel Craig. It's a convoluted mess and is not worth watching, and Daniel Craig's presence doesn't help anything. I rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stick with any other Bond movie besides the Daniel Craig films. You'll be much better off watching the real Bond movies instead."
" Just as bad as skywall was
",-0.5423,-0.957,2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,"The theme song was awful.This didn't seem like Daniel Craig.
This wasnt 007.
He isn't a playboy.
I would have cut/deleted the very strange scene with one of the girls out. He isn't a playboy. He isn't a fool.
He should have acted as how he did in Casino Royale or Quantum of Solace. Same with Skyfall. This was like Harry Potter(which is very bad).
I didn't like the cinematography. I didn't like the score. I didn't like the cars. I didn't like the references. I didn't like the gadgets. I didn't like how backwards minded the movie was along with Skyfall.It was slow, boring, the music was bad. There was choirs. It was rubbish, very computer, not enough orchestra and simply not David Arnold.I predict No Time to Die will have Malory/M as the villain along with MI6 mostly. I predict Blofeld will escape and get killed in this one. I predict Madelyn will be Bonds true love and will appear in more movies. It might not be Daniel Craig's last one he might do more with Madelyn Swann and he will beat Roger Moore's movie record. His part should have been played exactly like Casino Royale, the same goes for Skyfall.New review-
Update: I'm starting to enjoy it. Daniel Craig did a great job as James Bond 007. I want him to do at least four more or 8 in total. Cannot wait for No Time to Die. I predict Spectre will lose always. Madelyn Swann is the one, I'm sure of it and I hope they last through the rest of the Craig movies and I don't want No Time to Die to be their last one. If Madelyn isn't the one and he makes another one with someone else, I refuse to see it. James Bond should have one woman. The best thing about this movie with the romance with James Bond and Madelyn Swann."
" Bond is losing it
",-0.3818,-0.6986,2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"O.K., James Bond has been fighting all kinds of knockdown and drag-out battles for more than 50 years against a variety of muscular brutes and he has yet to display a single bruise or laceration? ""Spectre"" of course has more than its share of such hand-to-hand brutality, as well as outrageous escapes and pursuits, all the while
returning to just about every Bond cliché ever - mastermind villain wants to take over the world, high-tech, highly armed fortress located in the middle of nowhere, penetrated by Bond (and his current main squeeze), from which they make a miraculous escape and blow the place up in the process. The super-villain, assumed dead, reappears in the final showdown scene where he is vanquished once again by Bond's outlandish heroics. Isn't it time that we retired this genre, at least until they can come up with something even slightly more original? Daniel Craig is reportedly done with the Bond role and it's about time. He is just going through the motions, even when romancing women, without any of the humor or panache of earlier Bonds, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan. Requiem in pax, James Bond."

He's terrific in ""Spectre"". The supporting cast is also very good. Even the always annoying Christopher Waltz isn't that annoying in this movie. The story is kind of silly but the action is excellent. It is well staged and very exciting. There are so many great moments in ""Spectre"" that it's hard to list them. The movie also looks great. There are a bunch of winks and nods to previous Bond movies but it's not so inside that a 007 newbie might feel left out. ""Spectre"" is not only Craig's best Bond film but it's also one of the best in the series. Honorable mention: a dreamy Lea Seydoux.

The biggest flaws are the movie is a little to long, the pacing is very slow, the story's a bit of a mess, and the villain while he has a great intro scene and is amazingly acted by Christoph waltz he doesn't do much and there was a great idea to have him torture bond psychologically it's barely focused on and the twist that he's responsible for all the villains in the Daniel Craig movies is ridiculous. Not phenomenal, but a fun movie."

Craig is the all action hero lover of women and it will be sad to see him go. Sadly, it seemed to peak too soon and then the story lacked the punch and it slowed down quite dramatically. Cinematography though, excellent and I did like the orange glow to the film. Naomie Harris looks good as Eve Moneypenny, and played a great support role to Craig as did Ben Whishaw as Q. After winning The Palme D'or at Cannes with ""Blue Is The Warmest Colour, the young French actress, Lea Seydoux, plays a great Madeleine Swann, but the plot was to let the story down and didnt live up to expectations. The 24th Bond film was good, but not quite good enough."

This is at least a little less po-faced than its predecessors, with a couple of nods to the old Bond humour; but it shows the same tedious, unnecessary wish to delve into his back-story and motives. The script, a committee job, is lame. There are impressive locations but director Sam Mendes makes them all look incredibly drab; neither does he manage to thrill with what ought to have been some spectacular action scenes. The villain has less charisma than his cat - he can't hold a candle to his predecessors Donald Pleasance and Charles Gray - the girl is irritating, and the whole 'Bond Posse' thing they're trying to develop with Moneypenny, Q and M - it just doesn't work. Its two and a half hours - at least an hour too much - feel like five."

Bond is familiarly reprimanded at the beginning of the film and predictably brought back into the fold when his hunch proves to be correct.The plot is,... well a Bond plot. Global evil intent is brought to heel by one man on the side of a former Imperial power fighting a just cause. The segueing of former characters into this plot was especially welcome to me at least and have the plot more credibility. I thought the actress playing the grieving widow was particularly good. The script was middling, although all the actors turn in strong performances. If you're a Bond fan, a must watch."

" A bad Bond
",-0.5423,-0.9912,2020-06-07 00:00:00,2,"While one must disregard impausabilities in these films, one can't help but wonder whats going on!! Just a couple of stupid things. Bond arrives in Austria in a car or tram, then he's in an airplane chasing some bad guys. What??? How does he and the girl get so many changes of clothes?? On the train, which they had been on for a long time, all of a sudden a hood shows up. Why not earlier? And how did the bad guy even know they were on a train. A fight starts in the dining room and escalates into the kitchen. There is not one person around. No porter, no passengers, no chef of kitchen help. No One??/ How unrealistic is that? That's just a couple of many inconsistencies abound. Give me the earlier Bonds that unbelievable were still fun as in 'tongue-in-cheek. The ones with Daniel Craig are much too serious and plain un-enjoyable. Give us back the old Bond of yesteryear.
Poor Broccoli must be turning over in his grave at these latest Bonds. This is the worst!! Perhaps the franchise is over. All good things come to a dastardly end."
" Cannot go wrong with Craig IMO - although not perfect.
",-0.1139,0.9803,2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"In my mind, none of the Craig movies are bad - I think by far he is the best Bond. The acting is always top-notch and I think Craig does a spectacular job with the character. Bond films have always done a good job of blending drama with action but Craigs introduce a much more complex and realistic character that's not the robot we are used to. I love how they have introduced personality into the character, revealing personal feelings and battles, so real compared to the bland emotionless other versions. I also really enjoy how his films can be enjoyed independently or in order like a series since they all have ties to prior titles. This in mind, I find this is not my favorite title. Getting a bit tired of him destroying the cars after only 1 use, and I do find the story line wandering a little in this title. Cannot put my finger on it, but everytime I watch this film I don't get totally immersed into it like I do the other titles. I really do enjoy it, but somewhere either in the writing, editing, directing - I get a little distracted.However from a technical prospective I am a bit disappointed in the standards of the latest Bond films in 4k. I think for the money you pay, 4K Ultra disks should always be amazing video and audio. This disks video is simply tremendous, almost no grain and beautiful sharpness in all scenes. The lack of grain or noise in the dark scenes is sublime! Colours are good but I feel overall the cinematography does not really push the envelope in colour or dynamic range as most of the scenes are sort of dark and bland. The sound is where I am disappointed, a 4K Ultra disk IMO - should always be minimum DTS-X or Dolby Atmos, but this film offers best DTS-HD which is not really appropriate to the quality you expect to buy. I spent large dollars on my theater and media to get the sound but got a little cheated in this film. Contrary to bluray.com website, I do notice the lack of object placement sound in this film. However having said this, I found this film is really high on the drama scale with less action than expected so it's a not a total loss. Just the sharpness and clarity of the picture make this copy worth every penny."
" Blofeld is back!
",0.0,0.9933,2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"Like Skyfall before it, some of the scenes in Spectre are a bit on the show side with the pacing, however, I feel bringing back Spectre adds another dimension to the plot and helps tie in the previous movies as we discover who has orchestrated Craig's Bond movies.The Spectre reunion in Rome was reminiscent of our first encounter with the organisation in ""From Russia with love"" albeit a bit more drawn out. It was a nice touch, but felt it could have been shorter or a bit more informative of the organisation, without the pointless whispering bits. The subsequent car chase was decent, but maybe could have had more than just Hinx chase Bond for added excitement and urgent to Bond's escape.The train fight also reminded me of ""From Russia with Love"" whilst not as long, Hinx was already known to Bond, so more direct was better.I thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd half of the movie. In my opinion, Waltz is the best Blofeld we've had. If you want a great Blofeld, you can't go wrong with this talented German. He's already shown in his 2 Tarantino characters that he can be cold and calculating yet charming too. A more fleshed out and convincing villain than previous attempts."
" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.5096,2020-06-01 00:00:00,4,"I had high hopes for this film after watching the previous instalment Skyfall but I was very disappointed. It's interesting to reintroduce SPECTRE and Blofeld but it didn't do much with these. The main problem is that the film felt very ""empty"". There were a lot of moments where I felt that nothing of consequence was really happening and I didn't really feel anything."
" James Bond
",0.0,0.8271,2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Of all the James Bond movies this one is one of my favorite ones because it showed different places and its traditions. One of the places was Mexico and how Mexican people were celebrating a very known tradition which is ""Day of The Dead"". It was also filmed in some parts of Rome. As always it had a lot of action in it which makes it unique. Daniel Craig is a good actor who's always doing a great performance in his roles as James Bond. I found it interesting how Bond always finds out things or who's against him but in this case he discovers something he didn't expect to find."

There's also some other minor plot-holes and illogical things that happen in the movie, but it's nothing major... certainly it's nothing nearly as bad as the plot-holes in the previous Bond movies, so that's fortunate...That being said however, the actual movie is good... it's not excellent or spectacular... it's just good... solid 7/10"

",0.6705,0.9393,2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"When I reviewed Quantum of Solace, I wished that the next movie would have the budget for a steadicam and a director who knew how to use it, instead of the Bourne-age shaky-cam blender-edited rubbish of QoS.Spectre delivers, in spades, on that front - the opening sequence, one very very long single take (so it appeared) from street to rooftop, looked to me to be Sam Mendez showing Marc Foster how it's done.Satisfied by the intro, I sat back and enjoyed the rest of the movie, flaws and all, which I won't mention, as other reviewers have covered them already.Verdict: Excellent opening, followed by a fairly good 007 outing, enjoyable, warts and all, if you've ever liked a Bond movie.Bonus moment (the spoiler): Bond vs mouse: ""who are you working for?"""
" Oh well
",0.2732,-0.9818,2020-04-25 00:00:00,5,"In this Sam Mendes-directed Bond film, our hero finally goes up against Blofeld for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever, with the global criminal organization Spectre returning and Christoph Waltz taking over the villainous role.The film's usage of the Spectre organization and its characters was the end of long-standing litigation between Eon Productions and producer Kevin McClory, who sued James Bond creator Ian Fleming in 1961 due to the author taking parts of his work for the book and film Thunderball.McClory died in 2006, and in November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issues, giving the filmmakers full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with the evil organization.With the 00 group disbanded and M murdered from the last film, Bond is nearly a man without a country as he investigates the octopus-like Spectre. What a rough job Bond has, having to seduce Monica Belluci (who was the oldest Bond girl to date, doing the movie at the age of fifty. That said, Belucci is ageless).He learns why all this horror has been happening. After being orphaned, the younger Bond was adopted by Hannes Oberhauser. His son Franz believed that Bond had supplanted him as his father's son, so he killed the man, took the name Ernesto Stavro Blofeld and created Spectre with the sole goal of ruining Bond's existence.This film also gave pro wrestler Dave Bautista the chance to shine as bodyguard Mr. Hix. He's the fourth Bond villain to come from the sport, along with Harold Sakata, Peter Maivia and Pat Roach.While this film didn't win over fans, it certainly sets up Craig for one more run as Bond."

" Half-Brother !
",0.0,0.9982,2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,"At the time the latest Bond movie, if it wasn't for the Covid-19 virus, 'No Time To Die' would have been out, but it was delayed because of that (maybe an idea for a future Bond screenplay- a deadly virus). This film makes it a 3rd part of a trilogy (and possibly a 4th) as it continues on from where 'Quantum of Solace' left off, evolving the organisation Quantum into part of SPECTRE, and it also references Silva out of 'Skyfall' as a member of SPECTRE so possibly making that film into a part 3 and this film a part 4 of 'Casino Royale', confused? So am I.Daniel Craig does another good Bond role, and it turns out that Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) is Bond's adopted half brother, who'd of thought that. Waltz is good as Blofeld, but the film is a bit slow, not as dynamic as others, in 'Skyfall' the slow periods were filled with great acting, drama and good dialogue, but not so much in this, the intro is excellent though, and there are still plenty of action scenes, its directed reasonably well, but the music is not so good, but the continuation of using authentic locations helped, only some of the Moroccan and Rome scenes were filmed elsewhere (Mexico and London).Bond Themes:- It seems they are going back to the early Bond movies with the themes which is an excellent idea, we have a Festival again, not seen in a Bond film for many years, a Cable Car scene, Helicopters as usual (I think Helicopters have been used in every Bond Film to date, but I could be wrong?), Fight in A Train Scene with Henchman (ala 'From Russia With Love', 'Live and Let Die' and 'The Spy Who Loved Me') and a full MI6 crew - M, Q, Moneypenny, Tanner and now a 'C'' (but he was a baddie so won't be returning), no Felix Leiter though.
Henchmen:- We have one new one, harking back to Odd-Job and Jaws, in Hinx (Dave Bautista an American Wrestling Artiste). Cars:- An excellent Aston Martin DB10 with a Jaguar C-X75 chasing it, and a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith from 1948, can it get any better in Automobiles. They also had a few Range Rovers that idiots with too much money buy.Bond Girls:- Just 2 in this, No.68 is Dona Lucia played by Monica Belucci (Italy) who is a widow at the start of the film and Bond seduces here to get information, Monica is reported to be the oldest Bond Girl, maybe but she looks great, and still a lot more sexy than many of the previous Bond Girls. Then the main Bond Girl - Madeleine Swann (no.69 - appropriately) played by Lea Seydoux (France), daughter of the SPECTRE employee/hitman Mr White (who finally dies in this), but she is not a baddie, Bond goes to her to find the way to get into SPECTRE, she tries to escape/avoid Bond but of course eventually he wins her over at the end. The most attractive woman in the film was Estrella, played by Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman, who was Bond's companion in the Day of The Dead intro, but he runs out on her when they get to the room where she is expecting to get shagged, so I cannot include her as Bond girl, but worthy of a mention.Anyway, it's a bit down on 'Skyfall', and too long, if the slow parts were better I might have given it a high score, but it is still one of the better Bond movies.I have done my own average rating's for Bond films to date and The 4 Daniel Craig films rate the highest at average 8.5, with Brosnan's 4 not far behind at 8.25, Connery's at 7.5 (including 'Never Say Never Again') Dalton's 2 are averaging 7, with Roger Moore's at 6.9, I rated Lazonby's one film at 9, but since he only did the one, I am not counting it in this average rating. So Daniel Craig's are generally the best overall, I hope the next and Craig's last (and possibly the last ever) is as good."

I say even if you've never had interest in a James Bond movie before, but you are a fan of BBC's Sherlock (particularly Andrew Scott who plays Moriarty in that series) then see it for his acting, because he is awesome in this movie. Andrew Scott plays villains very well. That's not to say that Daniel Craig does a terrible job of playing Bond. He did a great job with his character as well. He had some witty lines(in fact, most characters did), and the action sequences were well done. Keep in mind the only other James Bond film I've seen is ""Skyfall"", so my opinion is based only on having seen that one other movie. The main plot didn't really have much, but there was a good food-for-thought subplot about global government surveillance that I thought was interesting. The car chase scenes were a little over-the-top and ridiculous, (There's no way his car should be driving up that curve.) but they were still fun. It's a little hard to keep track of what's going on, because there's lots of characters and subplots that are confusing. Is this one of the best films of 2015? No, but it is enjoyable.

" A delight
",0.5994,0.5341,2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"'Spectre', Daniel Craig's fourth Bond film, is a delight.The opening scenes in Mexico City are particularly fantastic, though all that follows is just as grand. Craig is still impressive in the lead role. Christoph Waltz is in this too, I'm always happy to see him in a film - he as Oberhauser is no different. Dave Bautista is solid, he makes for a good brute-force assassin.Plot-wise it's enjoyable, I'm liking the hardened continuity of the story since the 'Casino Royale' reboot. It can feel a little overly entwined, but I think they've done a fine job tying things together.I look forward to watching 'No Time to Die' when that's released."

",0.0,0.9406,2020-03-29 00:00:00,3,"With such a talanted cast, failing to make an interesting move should be considered an achievement in itself. However, this entire movie is such a monumental faliure that I even find myself missing George Lazenby.The script resembles something similar to the things I wrote as a 12-year old and forced my poor parents and relatives to read. Bond scripts arent generally known to portray an accurate description of the world, and they constantly tendens to ignore concepts like gravity, or consensual sex. But this... this isnt even believable on a Bond-level. And it is full of stuff that could easily been removed to give room to, I dont know, a believable dialogue? The blood tracker that litterally does nothing for the plot, or C, or the new Centre for National Security headquarter which is so supermodern that it does not need any People in it... Or security guards for that matter.The entire movie is based on 1) Bond never having a plan other that walking straight into traps, set up buy the worlds most powerful supervillain, and surviving; 2) Bond visiting women who does not like him and then they magically do (he is not even charming in the Bond-world), and; 3) Bond driving stuff that explodes and somehow still takes him exactly where he needs to go.Go see an old Bond movie instead. Any one of them will do. I promise."
" Bond is back doing what he does best ... Winning effortlessly
",0.8225,0.9944,2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"""Spectre"" is a 2015 action thriller directed by Sam Mendes starring Daniel Craig and Christoph Waltz. With this Sunday, the Road To Bond 25 has concluded for now and the latest installment has offered a lot of positive, as well as some negative aspects in an overall promising story. I personally consider the third movie to be best of the new saga, so I knew that it would be hard for the next sequel to become an equally entertaining thriller. While it's not exactly as messy as ""QOS"", it's not as brilliant as ""Skyfall"" either, but I expected nothing else, so I still could have some pleasure with it. First of all, it's a pity to see that the writers took back a lot of Bond's personal character development and healed him from a lot of the pain he's been through before in the process. He's again cool as always. But only cool as always. Where's the emotionality? Where's the vulnerability? It appears that he can take everything again without any great effort. It's quite sad to me that he's again given some sort of immortality. Aside from this, the film delivered some decent entertainment. Speaking of the story, the film managed to elaborate a well made continuation of ""Skyfall"". A secret mission that M has literally given to James from the grave? That's a nice link to the past, to be honest. It allows our favourite daredevil to perform some impressive stunts and disappoint the orders of his current employer. So, he's basically back at doing at what he does best. With a runtime of again two and a half hours, the film has still a lot to offer, even when it takes some time to get to to the best scenes. While following the legacy of his deceased former ally, Bond is once again tangled up in heart racing stunts and hard fights, the helicopter scene in the beginning being the most breathtaking of all of them. I also gotta give David Bautista some credit here, as he really brings the action into every scene with his simple presecne. The fight choreography on the train? Absolutely brutal and well made. What bothers me the most about this film though, is the general premise of it. Even if it more and more digs in the past of its protagonist and unravels secret after secret, it still kind of stays too much on the surface the most time and, most importantly, doesn't really create a threat that Bond has to eliminate. Before, the life of M and the lives of countless undercover agents were on the line. In here, the most work is done by his co-workers who manage to stop the MI6 to be merged with all other secret intelligence agencies. To be honest, he only finds out about the connection by coincidence. I was sure from the beginning that he'd succeed. Even if that's still tolerable and didn't keep me from having decent fun, it's still was a thorn in my side. Also notable is how Lea Seydoux is playing a femme fatale that is actually on a par with 007. Next to this, my feelings about the main villain were absolutely divided. On the one hand, Christoph Waltz played his role wonderfully with such a subtle danger he exudes and definitely made the fan boy in me scream out in excitement as he revealed himself as legendary Bond foe Ernst Blofeld, but on the other hand it bothers me how underused his character was in the story. It's brilliant how it puts together all the pieces of the past films that remained a mystery, such as the whereabouts of Mr. White and the origin of ""Quantum"", and reveals that everything in the past has happened by the hand of Blofeld's secret organisation ""Spectre"", but it's so underwhelming to see how the apparently most dangerous man in the world is defeated so easily and how Bond effortlessly puts a stop to his activities. I don't want to say that this mission was impossible, but his potential to be the evil arch nemesis who would most likely manage to defeat James basically crashes with a helicopter and is taken under arrest so easily. You know what I mean? He's brilliantly portrayed, but at the same time criminally underused and no big deal at all. All in all, this Bond film took a few steps back and offers a mediocre story with a few highlights, but also many aspects that I declare as wasted potential. It's still a massive pleasure to experience, as it still uses the basic formula that works out just fine, but it sadly lacks the sentimentality and emotionality that made its predecessor stand out. What I said, just fine, not brilliant. What bothers me the most is how it could have been magnificent, but now is far away from the high quality ""Skyfall"" has offered. In the end, it neither terrible nor outstanding. Nonetheless, I'm absolutely stoked for the final outing. Can't wait for November."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8834,2020-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Sadly this film was disappointing compared to the previous one. To me it really seems the James Bond series are either a hit or a miss. Casino Royale was good, Quantum of Solace was disappointing, Skyfall was great and this one, Spectre, is once again disappointing. It felt recycled and messy sadly."
" An underrated Bond film
",0.0,0.9965,2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I remember originally seeing Spectre in theaters near the films release date and thinking it was pretty solid. But other than that, I had pretty much forgotten what happens in Daniel Craig's most recent bond film even though I know exactly how I feel about his others. Casino Royale is one of my favorite movies of all time, it being an extremely riveting action film at the same time as re inventing all the classic bond staples. It's a bond film where a Bartender asks James if he would like his drink shaken or stirred and bond replies with "" Does it look like I give a damn?"" Truly great stuff! That's why for me at least( and I think a lot of other people) quantum of Solace was a truly disappointing movie. It had terrible directing, with a boring plot and constant action sequences where you have no clue what's going on. It's got very few redeeming qualities, so I just wouldn't even bother. The 2012 film Skyfall was a great comeback, being in my opinion almost as good as Casino Royale. Skyfall was easily the most Gorgeous looking bond movie I've ever seen, and this is largely due to the great Roger Deakins, the man behind the masterpiece Blade Runner 2049.
This brings us to Spectre. Spectre was directed by the same man who directed Skyfall, Sam Mendes, who later went on to direct the excellent best picture nominated war film, 1917. And just like Skyfall was, Spectre is a beautiful looking film. Sam Mendes obviously knows how to make a pretty looking movie, but how was the story? That's where the faults of Spectre begin to show. it starts off great, M has left Bond a message telling him to kill a dangerous criminal. This develops into a great mystery and the discovery of a dangerous organization called Spectre. Around the second act though, the film starts to get ridiculous in a very classic Bond type fashion. The problems begin to arise when it introduces a subplot about MI6 wanting to replace field agents with computers. This slowed the film down a lot for me, and I found myself wanting it to cut back to bond every time these scenes would happen.To me, this movie is a perfect popcorn type movie, being very fun and rewatchable, and I really don't understand the low rating it has on IMDB. If you haven't seen Spectre yet, I would recommend you go watch it."
" A step down, but still entertaining
",0.5927,0.9457,2020-03-10 00:00:00,7,"How do you follow up one of the best Bond films that deconstructed the formula completely? Make a much more straight forward Bond adventure, I guess. I like what's here. Bond continues his personal journey, the theme expands to look at the past vs future idea from a larger context, and we get a reintroduction to Bond's most iconic antagonist. It's a solid adventure made by a more independent filmmaker than the franchise is used to, but it doesn't quite connect as well as Skyfall.The story begins with a bit of retconning for Skyfall, having Judi Dench M deliver a message to Bond about the extent of Silva's attachment to the web of criminality that's been hounding MI6 and Bond personally since Craig's first appearance as the character in Casino Royale. Bond sets out to follow a series of clues that reunite him with Mr. White, lead him to Mr. White's daughter in Switzerland, and gets Bond face to face with the titular organization (not in that order).Of course, that's not how the movie itself starts. The movie starts with a long tracking shot through Mexico City that sees Bond trailing an Italian assassin through the Day of the Dead celebration. It's a technical marvel that moves from over the crowd to through it to up an elevator to out onto a ledge. It's a virtuoso moment, and a good way to begin a Bond film with a bang. Of course, the rest involved explosions, toppling buildings, and a fight in a helicopter over the crows. It's thinly exciting stuff, the sort of opening we expect from a Bond film.The mystery moves him to Italy where he has carnal relations with Monica Bellucci and gets his next clue taking him to a shadowy meeting of Spectre. Now, coming a couple of movies after the insane meeting of nefarious powerful people at the opera in Quantum of Solace, just having the rich people meet like they did in Eyes Wide Shut is refreshing. The meeting turns on two points: the introduction of the heavy, Hinx, and Blofeld showing up and identifying Bond without effort.Now, this is the point of the film that loses a shocking number of people. I don't really like the point, but I consider it relatively minor. Blofeld, in this version of Bond, is Bond's long lost, presumed dead, foster brother. Because of the attention Bond received from their father, Blofeld has nursed a simmering hatred towards Bond his whole life. It's thin and kinda stupid. It's a way to connect all the antagonists in the previous films to Blofeld and provide him with a tangible reason to target Bond through it all. It's thin, and I don't think it really works.However, everything around Blofeld's personal reasons for his plan (called his plan) works great. The theme of modernity versus the past gets fleshed out in a brand new direction in this film. It's no longer personal to Bond, it's about the presumed obsolescence of MI6 and the 00 program (which got touched on in Skyfall). Instead, the new head of the Joint Security Service, C, wants to drive all foreign intelligence into a surveillance dragnet that connects with eight other nations in what is called Nine Eyes (there is a real, very similar, thing called Five Eyes in the real world, by the way). 00 agents aren't necessary in a world of total surveillance and drones, he argues, but the moral argument in the film is on M's side (since Bond spends most of the movie in the field), and the conflict plays out. In a tighter film, some of this might have gotten sacrificed to get the movie to a shorter run time, but I think it adds a very interesting subtext to everything that's happening.The mystery Bond is tracking is centered around the effort to stand Nine Eyes up. It's the ultimate effort on Spectre's part to control the information of the most powerful countries in the world, and Blofeld is at the center of it. In order to get there, Bond has to go through Mr. White, White's daughter Madeleine Swann, and to Blofeld himself at his lair in the desert. It's there that we get our typical bond finale with the exploding base, but the movie continues beyond it. Because Blofeld is out to hurt Bond, and not just take control of information, he escapes and aims to do exactly that, hurt Bond. With the old MI6 building set to be destroyed, Bond must race in and save Madeleine from certain death, followed by shooting down Blofeld's helicopter with a Walther PPK and capturing the criminal mastermind. It's a well crafted sequence and a good one to end the film on.Ultimately, the movie has something on its mind, which is better than most of the Bond films, and is well executed. The personal connection between Bond and Blofeld, and the movie's lackadaisical pace (something that perhaps should have been addressed in an action spectacular film) drag it down a bit though. In the end, though, I think it's a quality adventure and a fun ride, if not Bond's best."
" Nice movie. But not on level on Skyfall or Casino Royale ( UK C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
",0.2263,0.4934,2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Visually stylish and a nice homage to the 60s Bond movies, neatly tying together plot points from the previous Daniel Craig bond movies, but felt quite pedestrian, I never really felt anything for any of the characters: things just happened without any excitement or emotion. At least it wasn't too silly, but again lacked humour."
" Mediocre, but at least much better than all previous 3
",0.5927,-0.9921,2020-02-29 00:00:00,6,"The bar wasn't high at all... but, still, Spectre, the 4th film in the series with Daniel Craig, did manage to be a much better film than all past 3 and overall a mediocre-decent James Bond one.It had a decent, somewhat intriguing story, it had some good action scenes and Daniel Craig's James Bond was the most likeable and accurate to the James Bond character we know & love compared to all his previous 3 portrayals. Before watching this, I was really doubting of going to see ""No Time To Die"". Thankfully, now I'm hopeful, that that is going to be decent.
That said, I do want to point out 5 negative aspects of the movie:1) Who closed the door at the opening sequence after Bond and the woman entered her room? The cameraman?!2) Dr. Swann's private psychiatric clinic is a glass building in the middle of nowhere on the snowy mountains of the Alps...?! I mean, it looks cool and all...3) Why that kind of a sick torture (similar to Casino Royal's)? Why?!4) *****SPOILER***** So the backstory is, that Bond was raised at one period with the villain by the villain's father. The villain was supposed to be the author of all Bond's (as Daniel Craig) pain, because of jealousy and stuff. He was supposed to have sent those past villains to him and to have killed his ex-girlfriends during the previous 3 films. Right? It feels though as if Bond encountered those past villains, because HE went looking for trouble/went to those past missions. And, were all his ex-girlfriends actually killed? I do find the motive very promising for the villain against Bond, but unfortunately either the connection to the previous films was not that convincing or the way they used that in this film was ultimately weak.5) *****SPOILER***** Dr. Swann says she loves Bond. He reciprocates implicitly. They both escape custody and death from the bad guys. Having escaped and being in a critical situation back in London, she suddenly simply says ""I can't do this. I can't go back to my old (spy and stuff) life. Can't ask you to change."" He says, ""You're saying goodbye?"". She, ""Yes, goodbye."" and boom! They split ways pretty easily, as if they've read the script and know they'll meet again in 15 minutes, after the villain, is conveniently able to abduct her, because they split ways! All I'm saying is, they could have backed up that shallow scene in an otherwise good storyline much better and easily fix it."
" Didn't think anything could top Skyfall. This did. It's a normal Bond film.
",0.2023,0.9325,2020-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Whether you think this is a sequel or a prequel set in modern times thats up to you. Fact remains James Bond invented reboots. And the movies were shot out of order so you can't really say they are prequels or sequels either. With all the Bond's films I've seen (all of them and used to watch them everywhere. Although I'm not a huge fan of the Daniel Craig movies that isn't to say they aren't good movies. Bond was never really meant to win Oscars and Craig's try. Thus removing the fun out of them :( Think License to Kill skipping like a record. Doesn't batter what building they are in, Optics doesn't really matter to me. So MI6 is blown up. Ho hum. Always thought that building was absurd anyway.. Should never show the building it's in. This was unique. Why Judi Dench was in the series at all. Well she wanted her 20 but it confused things a bit. Casino Royale was for sure a prequel as it was the first book. I consider the rest prequels Especially this movie. Smersh was before Spectre. Well no Blofeld is in the picture for the first time. I shall assume Dr No is in the future. Where Bond series goes from there thats up to the future. Is this a review? All I can say is I loved the teaser trailer to Skyfall, but Spectre was way better. It was a normal Bond film. Around Goldeneye or closer. Is any one Bond actor better. Well I like some more than others but they are all equal to me. So basically the 4th movie is connected to the 3 movies before it. It should have ended here. I see nothing wrong with the ending. So what about the Ejector seat. Each Bond is a reboot. And again shot out of order so I can't really say which is a Prequel after Casino Royale or not. Each movie is mainly connected to each other. Craigs are off a bit but not much. Vesper being the main issue. Yeah the movies before Craig were connected in someway but thats Bond. This was just a normal ending.; Whether he was retired or not (oh god how many times has he done that or gotten killed) Just a normal ending and a normal Bond. Bout BLOODY time!!!!"

All the ingredients that made 'Skyfall' good are retained here, but the story never quite gels, the set pieces veer from silly to stupendous, and at the centre of it all we have Daniel Craig who looks a bit bemused (and dare I say bored) by it all.The tone is off too. Ok, Craig is never going to be a pun heavy Bond like Roger Moore, but his delivery of the 'comedy' aspects is almost delivered through gritted teeth.It's also a violent film indeed, how it was only a 12A is shocking. Eye gouging, suicide, torture- a trip to the cinema with the kids this was not.It all makes for a muddled Bond film, that has now has its ending spoilt, because despite Craig saying he'd never return to the role, come Spring he's back again.Can't wait after this..."

He meets a gorgeous widow of a criminal, Lucia (Monica Bellucci), and he uncovers a sinister organization known as SPECTRE. He then goes on a mission to find a daughter of an old nemisis, and must stop the enemy Ernst (Christopher Waltz) before it's too late.The only little issue I had with this film was the story. At times the story kind of loses me because you're not too sure what Bond's number one main objective is. It seems like he does a whole lot in this one. The story, in total, wasn't bad, but it could of used some tweeking.Other than that, I loved the action. It was pretty intense in a lot of scenes, and this is actually the longest Bond film, clocking in a 2 and a half hours. For that amount of time, it ran in a pretty fast pace.The acting was also really good. Craig did another phenomenal job as Mr. Bond, and I loved the Bond girl in this one. Monica Bellucci made a perfect role and was very likable.Overall, Spectre is a pretty solid Bond film with a decent story and spectacular action packed elements."

Bond gets beaten up, not a scratch, stupid pulling the cuffs out pompous crap. The premise is actually good(minus the Waltz bond stuff), but the lack of good bad guy, poor fight scenes, and lack of the modern gritty bond, make this a long film with no real growth.Bond, has a mission, building upon the previous three films, spectre the super bad force, that really isn't that menacing or scary.Too long, not enough grit sums this up"

But repeated viewings of Quantum show it is a good film with a difficult plot.It has its moments but the script is poor and it is not gripping.

2. Ralph Fiennes is a serious downgrade as M. The ""Hot Priest"" would have been a better choice, but he wasn't well-known five years ago.
3. Seriously doubt an organization like Spectre would allow talented, capable assassins and members to be usurped by gigantic, mindless thugs in combat.
4. Recycled music really takes away from the presentation of the movie. It just feels lazy.
5. Over the years, the movies have contradicted each other about how the organization works. It's possible that in Quantum, the opera scene was set up as a plug for the production involved as it was in Mission Impossible 5. They went from an organization that was very private and shadowy, to driving expensive sports cars to a historical building in Rome which is sure to attract all kinds of attention. It's just ridiculously stupid.
6. Shooting down a helicopter with a handgun is beyond stupid.
7. Bond is supposed to not be able to recognize people after Blofeld's machine does its job, but absolutely nothing happens. Ok?
8. Why make Blofeld related to Bond? Why do this? He's an antiquated step-down compared to the characters introduced in the past twenty years.Sadly, the next one seems like it will be worse."

Many of the action scenes are some of the best in my opinion. Daniel Craig is great and funny at times. The Bond girl is pretty good. I enjoy the plot how the villain was a little underwhelming.

I'll always love a no-brainer action movie, but the time to move on is now. Sure it can be cool to be gritty but there comes a point where you're just too serious to be taken seriously and a new vision of Bond more willing to laugh at itself AND have some serious substance is something we're long overdue and that ruined me really finding this movie more than a modestly satisfying experience.Also, they tell you he goes rogue but it totally has no kind of build up or drama behind it, it just happens.

The film does not quite live up to these beginnings, in fact settles down into being somewhat of a strange experience which, I think, probably thought it was delivering something more powerful than it actually is, and ends up being a film which, despite the places it goes with a much-loved character, can only really induce a nod of approval when all has been said and done.But to delve too deeply here into precisely what I am referring to would spoil the surprise. Indeed, an odd thing happened some years ago off the back of people close to me settling down to watch ""Spectre"" - I remarked how interesting it was that the character of Blofeld was back. To my immense surprise, I was greeted by a 'tut' and told, despite not actually having seen it at that time, that that constituted ""...a spoiler"".Blofeld is indeed back - having last been seen during the opening sequence of ""Octopussy"", wheelchair bound and fluffy white cat in tow, wherein he was ambushed by Roger Moore's incarnation of the famous superspy and dropped down an industrial chimney in one of London's less glamorous areas. I am sure I read on the Internet Movie Database, some years ago, that the reason for ridding the franchise of the character had something to do with the dated feel Blofeld was weighing the series down with, and that the producers wanted to remove all doubt that he might make a return as a villain. What goes around comes around - 'the dead are alive', as it were. Funny how in ""Skyfall"", the franchise made a point to tell us that it was done with silly things like exploding pens, but here provides Bond with an exploding watch.The crux of ""Spectre"" is essentially a political essay on surveillance; probably its most interesting character is Bond's boss, M, played by Ralph Fiennes, and the conflict chiefly derives from the on-going spat he has with a younger, more cock-sure version of himself played by Andrew Scott. Scott plays a character called Max, whose office is in a big new plush building with a postmodern glass exterior, whereas M's office appears older and more traditional with a lot of wood panelling et al.There is bad news afoot for the Military Intelligence branch both M and James Bond (Daniel Craig) are, and have been, a part of for all these years: advances in surveillance technology are rendering Bond more and more obsolete; soon, the powers that be will have access to the intelligence information belonging to nine of the world's most powerful nations, simultaneously, completely negating the need for agents in the field. Later conflict over the issue is inferred early on when Max and Bond meet face to face in profile and James is told in no uncertain terms that this will change the double-0 section immeasurably. A spate of recent terror attacks around the world, often in the nations who are holding out against the legislation, are convincing people that this surrender to intergovernmentalism is the way forward. Eventually, Bond sets out to find out why.The usual ingredients are there: the hero gets a nice car and a female accomplice enters the fray later on. Generally, the film lacks a villain; the hit-man the bad-guys employ to do away with Bond is a big, silent Jaws-like assassin called Mr. Hinx who even gets into a well-choreographed fight with Bond and the girl on a train. Unfortunately, character motivation on the villains' behalf does not entirely add up: why attempt to kill Bond at all if your plan ultimately involves shutting down his division? And why, if there is such an integral connection between hero and villain, and they are destined to meet one another nearer the end at a desert base, make all the attempts on his life?More interesting to Mendes, and certainly to us, is the stuff on surveillance: the morality of it versus the fight against terrorism it seems vital to combatting. But how, as M points out, do you use it and who exactly has access to it anyway? The film certainly picks its side in the end, although it is generally all a bit of a strained attempt to remain topical - the franchise is essentially at war with its own beating core of depicting heroism and escapism: if Bond always saves the day, and the world can always rest easy in the knowledge he's out there to do so, what is the need for surveillance in the first place? Grown-ups know that in the real world, things work very differently. My mind drifts back to an article Christopher Hitchens wrote the day after 9/11, dryly beginning about how said spectacle is what happens when a hero like James Bond drops the ball, or doesn't make it in time to thwart the enemies.Amusingly, much later on, a character is arrested on what is described as 'The Special Measures Act'. Despite actually having been incorporated into something else as far back at 2005, this Act originally caused much consternation in Britain through its attitude to civil liberties, the core of what ""Spectre"" is about. This name-drop, more interesting than the finale around which it is mentioned, gets the broadest smile; the rest of the film is generally amusing but unspectacular."
" A perfect 10
",0.5719,0.9527,2019-09-19 00:00:00,10,"After reading hundreds of reviews on this title here on IMDB, family asked me to write a brief review.
Beginning with what must be my favorite intro song to any movie, in the world, and ending with an unexpected rise-from-the-dead of our villain...twisting the ending until your heart beats from that joyous adrenline rush that is forming in your chest that you only feel in 1 out of every 100 movies you see....This bond is on my short list of 10/10 Bond movies in that it is anything other than than predictable. Having read hundreds of reviews on here, it is anything but that. Such sore, dissapointing reviews for individuals rating this lower than an 8. It adds a sense of acknowledgement for the viewers that what you see if a good system being brought into motion at the MI6 headquarterts London to be upgraded to a high tech CSN instead (a surveillance network) which then becomes something unexpected. 'L'Amercian' is a term that comes from the h'spanic and french meaning for: 'The American' which makes your mind focus on a certain indvidual man / woman / or trans, but this may very well not be a person at all. The list goes on. When I sat down with family going through our list of 'unpredictabilities' a term we coined up and invented for good movies, we hit just over 30 different things that you would not expect in this film.Bringing us something else that stood out, I want to open your eyes to if you look hard enough, you will notice that in this Bond film there was minimal use of technology. You had a standard cell phone (not smartphone) that M uses, you had a GPS system in the body that was shut down not to be used anymore, there was little technology aside from Bond's own secret watch. Hell, even the gun was mechanical. I am used to the James Bond guns these days having fingerprint identification, something that is coming to our real world of handguns. This one, intentionally had a standard issue gun. Low tech 90's model, and beautiful because it worked perfect.There's my 10 minute writing for a review that deserved an hour. Now I must continue with dinner. This title deserved an Oscar's award. Hold on... I just checked, it received 2 rewards in the 2016 Oscar's.Thank you Ian Flemming, we love you for trying something new.Most Bond films are predictable. This one is anything but."

The ladies were old and dull faced. Mind you, amazing actors. But it's losing it's grip. The bad guys acted amazing but had pretty slow and boring character roles. Overall, I didn't like it much but when kept the thrill we seek in a JB movie aside, this was fantastic. I know, I'm a bit this side and a bit the other. You'll understand if you've seen it or about to. :)Peace out!"
" Grew up with Connery ! Like Craig better!
",0.717,-0.7135,2019-08-26 00:00:00,8,I'm having a hard time believing I'm saying this but the only drawback to the movie is Waltz as Spectre's super-villian ! His monotone delivery is beyond sophistication and seems to drag scenes on forever ! All of Craig's other antagonists are much more interesting characters ! But that's hardly enough to not like the movie !

Every single action scene is beautifully made and a joy to watch. It also stars one of the most stunningly beautiful females I have ever seen, Léa Seydoux. How Daniel managed to act cool in her proximity, I have no idea.Christoph Waltz plays the bad guy with his usual mannerisms and quirkiness, and is fun to watch. He's one of the more memorable bad guys in the Bond franchise.After a previous few bond movies which were mediocre with boring action scenes, I found Spectre to be amazing and much much better than I expected."

they also don't like Christopher Waltz's Blofeld but l think he plays it really well with a dark menacing quite voice. The only character that people seem to agree on is Ben Whishaw's Q, he's really good and has some excellent lines. Then there is Daniel Craig not my ideal Bond, but l enjoyed Skyfall, and S.P.E.C.T.R.E.. of course the best Bond by far Sean Connery, l also liked Pierce Brosnan in fact the sword fight between Bond and Gustav Graves in Die another Day, but to wind up this review back to Craig maybe not the best Bond but l would never call him a weirdo as someone on this site did."
" I wanted to like it but..
",0.3612,-0.994,2019-07-22 00:00:00,6,"James Bond movies defy logic in many cases (The hero is undead, the hero can take a plane down with his bare hands, the evil guy even if he has James Bond at a gunpoint, chooses to give him a way out) .This is typical James Bond but it is also enjoyable. This movie defies logic at a whole new level.
It has no actual plot, it has no soul. Daniel Craig looks tired of the James' Bond character, but I guess he could have let someone more eager to take the part instead of destroying the movie looking misearable.
And Cristoph Waltz. What a waste of such a great actor.. He showed up in the movie I guess for less than 10 minutes. And the reason his became evil??? Are you kidding me?? He became evil because his dad adopted an orphan boy?
This was the evil character's backround? That a spoiled Austrian brat got jealous that his father adopted another son?
But I should have known from the beginning,when James Bond recklessly hijacked an helicopter and put so many lives at risk. And for what? Because a dead woman told him to. And she also told him to attend the funeral?Why? Because she knew that as a sex maniac he is he would have sex with Monica Belucci and therefore find out where the criminal organization meets?
And Dave Bautista? He killed someone because he wanted his place at the table ,nobody hurts him for this disrespect,and then instead of enjoying his place at the organization,he embarks on a journey to hunt James Bond?
What a really unreasonable movie. Nevertheless ,it was fun to watch,that is why I still give 6 stars instead of 1 or 2."

And it's not like I overhyped it, I wasn't even that excited for it, knowing that I didn't like the previous Daniel Craig Bond movies that much. I also watched the 3 previous ones before watching this one. There was a good amount of connections to the previous movies but I didn't feel like that really added anything to the experience. the action was good as usual, with some BEASTLY fight scenes. The acting and directing were good. But the story was forgettable, as was the villain. It dragged at times. And there were a few scenes I didn't like (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
like before he reached the villain and he saw the faces of all the people he was responsible for that had died, when pictures of their faces were taped to target practice posters at a gun range. Like really? The villain would go through all that to show Bond all the people he let down? I know the villain wanted to hurt him, both physically and psychologically, but that just seems unrealistic"
" Uninspired

I imagined that James Bond would be a more cool and smart agent. In spite of that, he was a goof-up, messed up often and couldn't get over women. So I couldn't bear to be broken my ideal Bond who would be hard-boiled guy.
Then I asked my father if that was exact Bond. But he said just yes. I was astonished.Just I liked the opening images of octopus."
" The Return of Bond, James Bond
",0.0,0.9921,2019-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Spectre is a start to finish thrilling film in which director Sam Mendes does a fantastic job bringing back 007 from his previous film Skyfall. Daniel Craig, playing the role of James Bond, stars in his fourth and final Bond movie as he travels the world in attempt to save his team and uncover his past. Following an action packed scene where Bond protects his family estate in the conclusion of Skyfall, Mendes grabs your attention right from the opening scene of Spectre. After a long chase, some gunfight, and a helicopter crash landing, Bond manages to make it out alive. The movie continues with edge of your seat intensity that keeps the audience engaged right to the final cliffhanger.
In my opinion I thought Daniel Craig did an outstanding job carrying out the role of James Bond and ends his Bond movies with a bang. Craig's portrayal is convincing and you almost forget he is not actually James Bond. Everything including the script was flawless, with the only negative being a couple of slow spots in the story line. However, Mendes makes up for this with his always surprising and amazing action scenes.
The filmmakers and videographers do an excellent job throughout this film. To start they give the audience a wide angle shot to show the general scene which is Mexico City during a crazy festival. Then it slowly zooms in to identify Bond and his target. I really enjoyed this opening scene and the intense motorcycle race that set the mood for the rest of the movie. As far as editing goes I think they did a perfect job and there was not one moment where I noticed any flaws.
I also enjoyed the sound and music throughout the movie. It enhanced the mood of each and every scene and made them each come to life. Never was there a time where I felt the music was unnecessary or distracting and I thought the sound effects, including gunfights, were spot on and heart stopping.
A final attribute of this movie is how the filmmakers and producers used CGI to show the audience some real life graphics that are generated on a computer. Right from the opening scene when Bond is in a motorcycle chase on the rooftops and blows through a window was incredible to watch. In my opinion I thought that they were convincing and had me sitting on the edge of my chair through every action scene. I'm not an expert in this field but there wasn't one part in the film where I thought something didn't look completely real.
In conclusion I thought Spectre was overall a great film. There were a couple slow parts but Bond movies never seems to disappoint and the action picks up right away. In the end Bond achieves his mission but director Sam Mendes leaves the audience with another cliffhanger, in true Bond fashion. I highly recommend you watch this movie especially if you enjoyed the previous James Bond films."

Well, it certainly tried with ""Spectre"", but fell short. While it was interesting to tie all the Daniel Craig films together, the pacing was just slow. Even the action felt like it took too long. In the end, the reveals felt like they happened too late because the investigation part of the film dragged on for the majority of it. This film even nodded at the tropes that make the Bond franchise what it is, but then went right ahead and followed those exact tropes itself."

This film didn't have the right elements to deliver them. Just chase - shoot - crash - explosion and repeating it.Well, after 5 years off screen which Bond never had since the early 1990's.

Daniel Craig is a wooden actor compared to Brosnan or Connery. Also the product placement and ""jet set"" commercialization of the Bond series have started to annoy me immensely. Some Russian or Middle-Eastern youngster might find bling still fascinating, but for a western person these depictions of opulence offer nothing.

I also had really high hopes for Waltz as the villain, but somehow he managed to be a huge letdown, which made the entire ending sequence seem generic and anticlimactic. Other than that there were some great action scenes. Most notably, the epic fight with Bautista, which is the best train fight in movie history. The opening scene with the building collapsing and the plane takeover was pretty intense too. His romance with Swann isn't exactly say, ""Vesper quality"", but despite her being half his age it is somewhat believable. The visuals are beautiful as always. You definitely have to see it if you're a Bond fan. I just hope that Craig has one round left in the chamber for Bond 25 if it is his final outing before hanging up his PPK, because we KNOW he has more in him than this."

Zero tension with zero feelings for the character......possibly the first movie in a long time, I and my friends could walk away without even talking about except feeling cheated.
Oh yeah, I agree the villian henchman actually brought the Sean Connery kind of villian and fear experience back which was about the only thing most of my friends ever talk about that film."

It's just a real crying shame they let the script totally go in this one. Not as meaningless as quantum of solace. But just as unsatisfying with a really weak lead to the next film that I hope they rethink. Also, Idris Elba for bond, he may not be as young, but he'd be such a beautiful change and for those who have seen Luther, he has more charm and capability than many others who are being put forward"

" Spectre
",0.0,-0.612,2019-03-16 00:00:00,4,"Spectre
Spectre is the latest James Bond film released. It stars Daniel Craig in the role as Bond for the fourth and possible final time. It is directed by Sam Mendes, who directed the previous Bond film, Skyfall. This is the 24th official Bond film overall. Two-time Oscar winning supporting actor Christoph Waltz plays Bonds antagonist in the film. The film won an Oscar for its main theme song, Writings on the Wall, by Sam Smith.In his latest film, Bond is faced with uncovering a mysterious and shadowy organisation known as Spectre. In usual Bond style, he gets the girl beats the bad guy and saves the day. Spoiler alert.There is nothing special about the cinematography. The opening of the film begins with a long take, that while grand in scale, added nothing to the story. If ever did a film show the true meaning of long takes, it was this one. It seems like long takes are nothing more than an interesting gimmick rather than a display of talent. While there is no use of shaky cam or similar types of camera usage, the film looks dull and boring. And what's worse is that the film is dull and boring.There seems to be two important points of agenda for the film, unfortunately none of them is to make a good film. Firstly, Mendes is tasked with using the name Spectre, after the production company got the rights to use the name again. Secondly, Mendes is forced to make this film appear to be the end game of the previous three Daniel Craig film, shoehorning the films together. If it wasn't for the fact I had seen the other films I would have found this believable, but given the fact that Waltz's character which is apparently so important was not so much as hinted at in the past it seems ridiculous.Waltz lacks his usual charismatic fear he gives as an antagonist, and instead gives a boring performance as a villain. Bond has degenerated into a mute faceless agent, interchangeable with any other white, blond male. The relationship he has with two women in the film are laughably ludicrous. At one point in the film, Waltz tells us that Bond is in love. There is no indication to the audience that Bond has these feelings, nor is there any indication if he reciprocates these feelings. It seems like the film is trying to convince of something by repeatedly saying it.The plot is longer, boring and somewhat pointless. In some ways the film expects the audience to love it just because it's a Bond film. Spectre needlessly keeps referring to its predecessor Casino Royale in subtle ways, however given that Casino Royal came out nearly ten years ago, it would be near impossible for a casual movie goer to understand what the film is talking about at times.Boring action, an uninventive and long plot and uninteresting characters, Spectre is a chore to watch with no pay off. As a positive side there was no terrible acting.I'd have to give the film a 4 out of Ten.

" The best James Bond movie ever
",0.6369,0.34,2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,I have seen all James Bond movie and believe me this one is the best one I don't think anyone will regret from watching this movie
" Beautiful but hollow
",0.3506,0.9942,2019-03-09 00:00:00,5,"This review contains spoilers.Spectre is an action spy movie that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes who had directed Skyfall, the previous installment. The movie is based on James Bond by Ian Fleming. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz and Léa Seydoux. James Bond is pitted against the Spectre Organization which is revealed to have been responsible for the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. James Bond must thwart the leader of Spectre in Ernst Stavro Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz.Spectre is a beautiful movie with exciting action scenes. The movie is well shot much like the previous Bond movie of Skyfall. The movie has amazing action set pieces that are both exciting and impressive to watch. Spectre has a great ability to convey tension to the screen with a few key visuals. The direction from Sam Mendes starts impressively and continues across the 140 minute running time. The James Bond movies always have an impressive opening scene and Spectre is no exception.This opening scene is one of the most impressive opening scenes in the recent James Bond movies. The editing and direction flow incredibly well as James Bond is thwarting a terrorist plot in Mexico city during the Day of the Dead. This opening scene is one of my favorites across the James Bond movies that I have watched. The editing, and direction does continue into the running time and is an absolute positive for this movie.Spectre's problems are however numerous. This movie is not well written. The movie felt like a mix between Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. The villain in Ernst Stavro Blofeld is similar to Raoul Silva from Skyfall. The villain has an intricate and well thought out plan with loads of resources. The plan is revenge against James Bond and MI6. The Quantum of Solace writing style seems that to have re-emerged in this movie. There is so much bloat in this movie. It seemed as if the movie tried to both play it safe and take risks which lead to an inconsistent tone. There are so many plot points that the viewers simply have to accept. This movie throws these plot points in to be accepted by the fans of previous movies. I felt that this did taint the older movies rather than offer a new way of looking at the older movies. I felt that the older movies were better off at feeling more stand-alone rather than being forced to tie in a long story arc across multiple movies. This made the movie of Spectre feel less impactful than it should have been. The grand reveal that both James Bond and Ernst Stavro Blofeld shared a common childhood felt incredibly hollow. None of the earlier James Bond's had even hinted at this. This is absolutely an aspect that could have been improved upon to help the story, but it required more of a setup across the earlier Bond films.The acting in this movie is solid. The three leads in Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, and Léa Seydoux do a capable job. I enjoyed Christoph Waltz's performance even though I did not enjoy his character. Christoph is able to portray a great screen presence even when his character is not well written Likewise Léa Seydoux and Daniel Craig do a good job in their roles. It would have been better to see more from Léa Seydoux's character of Dr. Madeleine Swann, who is not introduced until the movie is already well underway.Spectre is not recommended. The movie has enough to satisfy action junkies but anyone looking to a conclusion to Bond's story are started in Casino Royale will be disappointed.Grade: D"
" A depressing, 'washed-up' lifeless Bond flic. Easily the worst Bond movie ever.
",-0.6486,-0.7832,2019-02-28 00:00:00,3,"I am actually currently very 'unfamiliar' with.......and have never 'officially' rated ANY Daniel Craig-era James Bond movies -until NOW.
Up until the ""Daniel Craig"" era -- all James Bond movies -- even the 'worst' in the series -- have had a sense of 'magic' and 'charisma' as well as great action scenes and utilized 'techno-gadgetry' on a level that only few other movie franchises have. In my opinion, even the 'worst' James Bond movie that I can recall -up till the ""Daniel Craig"" era- ""A View To a Kill"" still effectively presented a certain level of 'magic' and 'intellectuality' and charisma and 'interest' that was befitting of this movie franchise. I recently 'officially rated' ""A View To Kill"" -- and rated this flic 2 stars......and considered it to be, by a slim margin, the worst Bond movie that I could recall watching. That being said, ""A View to a Kill"" is by no means a bad movie.....but it is 'mediocre.'
Daniel Craig, if nothing else, is perhaps an actor -- a 'product' of his era: Even though technically he is the first ever 'blonde-haired' James Bond actor....he does have a presence and a decent amount of 'charisma' and 'attitude' and 'demeanor' that is befitting of '007.' He is also -since he is a product of his era- easily the most stoic, serious, un-humorous and to a great degree 'mean-spirited' and vicious and sadistic James Bond actor -which, for me, makes him easily the least 'likeable' James Bond actor ever. He is in every way the 'antithesis' of esp. say, ""Roger Moore."" 007 actors such as Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery, and Pierce Brosnan on the other hand found the perfect balance between being intelligent, dangerous, and serious....but also being 'likeable' and having much charsima and screen presence as well.
Another attribute of Craig is that he seems to probably be the most 'physically-adept' Bond actor ever -in terms of fighting ability and stunts...The movie, ""Spectre,"" starts out in Mexico City where ""The Day of the Dead"" is being celebrated. The imagery and cinematography for this event is saturated with soft and dusty yellow/orange hues and tones give the impression that Spectre is transpiring in a day and age of a post-apocalyptic neo steam-punk world. The opening helicopter scene is probably the most amazing helicopter action sequence since the beginning of the 1981 Bond flic ""For Your Eyes Only."" After this scene.....the plot of ""Spectre"" unfortunately lags into oblivion and remains quite 'uninteresting' -- only barely watcheable for quite sometime. The first half of the movie, ""Spectre,"" especially......feels completely 'purposeless,' 'washed up,' 'pointless,' and 'dead.' All of the magic and interest that permeated Bond movies prior to the ""Daniel Craig"" era are completely 100% absent in much or most of ""Spectre."" The cinematography -esp. during the first half- of ""Spectre"" is dark, unimaginative, and uninteresting and is the antithesis of 'eye-candy': It is 'eye-salt.'There is a 'semi-okay' car chase scene in which Bond is driving an Aston Martin or Jaguar.....but this is a very overrated chase scene and fails in comparison to pretty much all other car chase scenes in all previous Bond movies. This chase scene isn't nearly as memorable as car chase scenes in Vin Diesel movies ""The Fast and the Furious"" nor does it even compare to chase scenes in any of the movies of the ""Jason Bourne"" franchise. Even the opening car chase scene of the 1981 Bond movie ""For Your Eyes Only"" (when Bond and his female companion bound over trees and hills in a four-wheel drive utility jeep-type vehicle) is much, much more interesting and 'creative.'
The plot and pacing of ""Spectre"" as well as the dismally-dark and depressing cinematography fortunately does become more 'intelligible' and interesting as the movie progresses, thank goodness. The scene where Bond chases villains -while Bond is in a plane and the villains are in vehicles- is definitely a fairly vintage ""Bond-esque"" scene....one of the EXTREMELY FEW in the entire movie.
Ben Whishaw is unbelievably-terribly-miscast as a new ""Q"" replacement. He isn't only '2 steps down' from the likeability and charisma and intelligence of the former ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn) - he is '20 steps down': He comes across as very confused and uncertain and unintelligent.
Finally, the ""Spectre building complex"" which comes into the plot towards the end of the movie doesn't embue anything resembling the sense of 'awe' or 'wonder' that villainous buildings/complexes embued in previous Bond movies -such as the orbiting space station in ""Moonraker.""
In my opinion, ""Spectre"" is clearly the worst Bond movie that I have so far ever seen or 'rated.' It seems to have higher 'production values' than 'A View to a Kill.' But most everything about 'Spectre' seems 'forced,' lifeless, pointless, lacking in magic or interest and just completely 'washed up.' The opening theme music ""Writing's on the Wall"" was merely just barely 'okay' -- and certainly far inferior to the Duran Duran theme song 'A View to a Kill' and most other theme songs from previous Bond flics. All things considered, I rate ""Spectre"" 3 stars."

" Enjoyable installment in Bond series with lots of noisy action, thrills, emotion and spectacular scenes
",0.5719,0.2617,2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Nice entry stars Daniel Craig as the tough, two-fisted James Bond who takes on nasty organization nicknamed Spectra with a octopus-like symbol . After a risked and disastrous assignment in Mexico, Bond is suspended. But he goes on his activities by tracking down a massive criminal syndicate. Then Bond receives a cryptic message from his dark past, it sends him pitted against a sinister and criminal group. It is led by a terrorist chief, Blofeld : Chistoph Waltz who has an ancient relationship with Bond's own childhood. While Q , Ben Wishaw, delivers him some rare and fantastic artifacts to carry out his dangerous missions. Shortly after, MI6 chief M : Ralph Fiennes is replaced by another boss, Andrew Scott. Later on, Bond meets the beautiful daughter, Lea Seydoux, of a long time enemy and then things go wrong.Once again Bond confronts an ominous and bloody organization with terrorist purports . This film takes parts of other 007 episodes as the violent fight between Bond and a hunk contender : Dave Bautista on a train , similar to Sean Connery versus Robert Shaw in From Russia with love. And the impresssive finale including the stronhold facility in the sunny desert and its destruction bears remarkable resemblance to Quantum of solace. Nicely played by Daniel Craig, this is his fourth entry, first was Casino Royale, following Quantum of solace and Skyfall. He is well accompanied by a young Bond girl, Lea Seydoux, and another Bond woman, the mature Monica Bellucci, the eldest Bond girl. The heinous leader of the powerful organization Spectra is magnetically performed by usual villain Christoph Waltz. Adding regulars of the old franchise as M well played by Ralph Fiennes, Q finely acted Ben Wishaw and Naomy Harris as Moneypenny.The film packs a colorful and glimmering cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, shot in various locations as Mexico city, Austria and especially in London. As well as pounding and rousing musical score by Thomas Newman. The motion picture was well directed by Sam Mendes, though with no originaly. Mendes is a good director who has made some successful films played by important actors, such as : Jarhead, American Beauty, Revolutionary road, Road to perdition and another Bond movie : Skyfall. Rating: Above average. Well worth watching."
" A Decent if Not Spectacular Bond Movie
",0.0,0.8133,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"19 November 2015. Spectre doesn't have the raw, serious, and potent power of Casino Royale (2006) nor the logical precision, believability of Bourne Identity (2002). Interestingly there are elements of Roger Moore's playfulness which the director Sam Mendes incorporated with a smooth stylishness, instead of the more gross simpleton dialogue. The car chase was some of the best fresh scenes of the movie and the underlying techno plot was very compelling and relevant with the actual Paris terrorist attack spreading across today's headlines. The issue of security over privacy is very meaningful today. Overall, this Bond movie was more interesting and entertaining than expected but did didn't have the same compelling realism of the earlier Daniel Craig versions."
" Classic Bond (For Better and Worse)
",0.4404,0.9976,2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"Spectre was one of my most anticipated sequels of the last few years. With my complete love for Skyfall and the return of Sam Mendes I was convinced this film would replicate my love for that film but in the end Spectre was a mixed bag that did leave me disappointed.On a technical level this film is almost perfect. Sam Mendes return as director did not disappoint, he maintained the level of skill he had in Skyfall. The action sequences are once again brilliant with a good pace and they occur at a more regular pace than its predecessor. The cinematography may not be on the level of Skyfall it's still fantastic in a different way. The opening tracking shot was the right way to start the film on and its a shame the rest of its runtime didn't live up to that.Daniel Craig is again great as 007, he's not given as much of an arc as the last films but he still plays the characters dedication well. Waltz, while underused, has a great presence to him and plays of Craig very well. Fiennes, Whishaw and Harris all return as the MI6 staff and all play bigger roles than ever before and its good to see the filmmakers develop more of a team dynamic than Bond simply acting on his own for the entire runtime.Where the film fails is its pacing and overlong runtime. Spectre is the longest bond film to date and its defiantly felt. There are so many portions of the film that drags and do not justify their need to be kept in the film. The subplot at MI6 don't mesh well with Bonds quest to hunt down Spectre and drags down the pace of the film.
The villains were also fairly disappointing. With the exception of Dave Batista, who played his character perfectly as a physical threat to bond and a fun character to see collide with Craig. Andrew Scott was a fairly one note character one doesn't truly have much screen time to get me invested in MI6 taking him down. Waltz is the perfect cast for a bind villains but he's barely in the movie. The film spends too much time building up to him and not enough time paying off. The decision to merge him and Bonds past didn't work and didn't add enough to either of their characters. I hope Waltz returns in the next film to give him a better script and more screen time to work with.Spectre, while not without its enjoyable moments, was a disappointing movie for me. It's pacing was spotty and dragged on far too long and the villains do not live up to their true potential. It does benefit from its solid supporting cast, great visuals and a fantastic visual design. I do hope that the filmmakers improve upon the faults of this film and improve upon them to ensure that Craig's version of the character can end on a high note.6.4/10 - B- (Middling)"

This Bond is probably the worst after Quantum of Solace. Devoid of wits and too stylized.

Something about Bond that seemed to have lost that fabulosity and tension that was always there during the Sean Connery and Roger Moore days. Instead what we have is too much stylish mtv poses and politically correct scripts making it just an average spy movie.

" ""I've really put you through it, haven't I?""
",0.0,0.9272,2018-12-05 00:00:00,7,"I watched this film right after ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and was surprised to see the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) show up again, but this time it's the son of the character in 'Diamonds'. Which is somewhat confusing when you consider that the 'Spectre' Blofeld referenced his father in the past mentoring the childhood James Bond, thereby setting up a personal rivalry between them. So who was the James Bond in the 'Diamonds' film? I'm not a Bond fan well enough at this point (while watching the films out of order) to understand if there's a lineage in the Bond family, but it doesn't seem likely to me. Oh well.Aside from the revelation of a criminal organization known as SPECTRE, this is pretty much a by-the-numbers Bond flick with all the elements we're used to seeing in prior films. However Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci) isn't around long enough to classify as a true Bond villainess, while Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) doesn't appear to have the charisma needed to pull off her role as Bond's assistant. Andrew Scott lacked the gravitas needed to pull off the role of Max Denbigh/'C' of the newly merged British Intelligence unit comprised of MI5 and MI6, leaving Blofeld perhaps the most interesting character. Daniel Craig himself appeared a bit lackluster to me as well, it might have helped if he cracked a smile every now and then.I did like the opening Mexico City segment, very colorful and culminating with the best action sequence of the picture. Trouble is, it just about topped everything else that followed making even the reveal of SPECTRE's global surveillance system somewhat anti-climactic. But now that I've gotten on this recent James Bond kick, I'm inclined to view the entire series in order of release to get a sense of continuity going and get up to speed with events and characters I'm not familiar with. Should be an interesting exercise."

" Enjoyable film but what is with blofeld.
",0.2382,0.9647,2018-11-11 00:00:00,7,"In the film spectre there is everything you can expect from a james bond film cars, action, girls and villans however the villan in questions is the biggest problem I have with this film Ernst Stavro Blofeld is a character in charge of spectre and they have never given him a personal connection to bond in any of the other films however in this one they made him bond's brother! What!? Later on in the film they make him rip off the joker from the masterpiece the dark knight and tells james bond to ""finish it"" this is the worse bit in the movie despite the title sequence; not only does Bond have no reason not to shot him, this also goes against blofeld's character as a whole as he would be the type who would want to keep alive no matter the cost, even diamands are forever understood this. The sad thing is I would have thought he was great as a villan if he hadn't been blofeld. Maybe it will show his change into the more slimy tradationally take on blofeld in bond 25 which will will make this film more enjoyable but as it stands that's something I can't overlook.However the films has lots of great action like when they have a fight scences on a train and great refrences to previous bond films to enjoy also a great bond girl. I just consider it to be in a seperate contuntity because of blofeld drastic character change also the opening title was so bad I don't want to talk about it."
" Copying the brother storyline from Austin Powers was very lazy.
",-0.4201,-0.9417,2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Blofeld in the books is NOT James Bonds foster step brother. But you could say that Daniel Craig looks nothing like James Bond either. A lot of fans didn't care about the lazy, cheap copy of a script. Yeah the cinematography is good but is ruined by the awful ORANGE tint. The reused tracks from Skyfall was lazy. Again, Blofeld was very weak. The whole Spectre storyline is weak and not mentioned enough. The title for the movie as well. Why couldn't we have another title and make Spectre be the surprise? The movie is called SPECTRE, but the movie is more to do with Bond falling in love, yet again, and very quickly. It was only 2 movies ago that he just got over Vesper. This is also not Bonds character. He would never leave MI6 over a girl that he just met. It took him along time to fall in love with Tracy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Sam Mendes did a fantastic job with Skyfall, in my opinion. But fails with this movie. He did say in previous interviews before making this movie that he did not want to come back to make another Bond movie so that does show in this movie. Spectre is very lazy written (by 5 writers and Daniel Craig). Spectre is also directed with no care. Spectre doesn't seem to be a James Bond movie, but more like a fan movie who prefers Mission Impossible and Austin Powers.I saw this the first day in IMAX and I was just appalled at the end. I remember a kid sighing all the way through the movie. And the strange thing I come across, is that a lot of ''Bond fans'' actually enjoy this movie. I actually prefer Quantum over this. At least they did the secret organisation plot a lot better than Spectre. I literally thought Quantum would be the new Spectre for Craig's era. Guess not. Now we have to pray that the next movie is an entirely different story, just like Skyfall. I am not a fan of the story continuity, bringing up the past, awfully. I didn't mind Quantum of solace doing that, as it was a DIRECT SEQUEL. They didn't have writers strike with Spectre but the script seems like most of them rushed the script while half asleep and drunk while watching bloody Mike Myers."

The glib one-liners, the sometimes cavalier attitude, playing the ladies from the beginning, always looking for a way out. And he was less gruff in this one. He relied more on wit and stamina rather than brawn and anger. The music was better too. The Bond theme is heard very early on. Waltz as Blofeld was a solid choice. Bellucci was a nice addition as a Bond girl too. Seydoux wasn't Oscar worthy but above average as a Bond girl relatively speaking. It was hard to rate and make it comparable to classic Bonds. Fiennes is a far superior M. Dench always played the character as a b**** with a chip on her shoulder in typical woman power fashion. She added a bitterness to the Bond films that I didn't care for. I agree with Pierce Brosnan this one was too long. If it had a better script and was condensed they could've had a classic on their hands. But I would say this one got closer than previous Daniel Craig outings. If the franchise keeps going in this direction they will not only win over new fans but they will retain classic fans too!"

" Had potential and had its moments, but there are better Bond films
",0.5927,0.828,2018-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Sam Mendes returned as director for the fourth installment of the Daniel Craig James Bond series. With everything from questions of how long Craig would be doing this to what a huge budget the film had, there's lots to discuss.Arguably the best place to start, lets talk about the beginning. Production values are imminent from the opening shots. Although there is hardly a cut or a word for the first five minutes, there isn't really anything special that happens. And this ends up taking a toll when the run-time is just under 2 and 1/2 hours. There's some cool helicopter stunts (with some disbelief of reality put aside), but I still consider this action sequence only the third best. And then you also have to talk about Sam Smith's ""Writing's on the Wall."" His voice is fantastic and the relevance of the animation in accordance with the story is appreciated, but there's some lacking quality that doesn't seem to fit in with a 007 film. And the animation overall didn't strike me as impressive, so I still rank this theme as third best as well.Spectre attempts to tie in the previous films into this plot. I guess there's points for effort, but it doesn't really have a huge emotional connection to pull it off. And there were multiple instances where a scene could've been tidied up or even cut entirely. But no. This movie just had to make it to 2 1/2 hours. It's just really long and a little draining.I think I was still fine with the film up until a snowy mountain sequence where Bond ends up driving like this cargo plane. And as problems arise, the sequence goes into the most Pierce Brosnan-esque style of action-- so over-the-top that it's just like c'mon man.Lea Seydoux adds a nice touch, and Monica Bellucci certainly adds a bit of a surprising element for Bond Girls. Really have no issue there. And then fans of Sherlock will recognize Andrew Scott in the film. Having gained attention as Moriarty, I was intrigued to see him step into a different role... That didn't happen. Pretty sure the producers told him to act almost exactly as Moriarty had. The result is nothing surprising, which is a disappointment and also a little frustrating.But lets talk about what had the most potential overall for the film: Christoph Waltz. After having Javier Bardem kill it as the villain in the previous film, I think Waltz is an excellent choice to bring new elements. But this is easily the worst aspect of any Daniel Craig Bond film. Which pains me so much to say because there's a good deal of build-up. His introduction has great camerawork and lighting, and it creates a mystical veil around the organization and his role behind it. And this lasts for lets say 8 minutes. Then the movie basically forgets about it for a good hour. He's brought back, and it could still be very interesting despite a drop in fanfare. But what was supposed to be a tense, high-production action set-piece is set back with a surprisingly boring backstory for the villain filled with ideas that say ""This is the bad guy and he's bad and he does bad things because he's bad"" and unbelievably predictable action. And I guess they make it appear he's dead, but everyone knows that's not the case--even if the run-time is padded already. The climax reminds me of Mission Impossible Rogue Nation if that climax was also filled with cliches. And what I mean by that comparison is that Rogue Nation kind of has their climax setup like a heist, and you don't really feel any tension because you feel like it all is part of the good guys' plans. Spectre is similar to this, and the ignorance and stupidity that leads to the demise of the villain makes me think that the writers just couldn't think of any other logical possibility for a death.Spectre isn't all bad, like the returns of Ben Whishaw as Q and Ralph Fiennes as M were very welcome, but it's a very flawed film that certainly had potential.

In particular Rome looked nice. The cinematography was visually pleasing with lots of clever, often shadowy, lighting.The espionage thriller with Daniel Craig as Bond and French actress Lea Seydoux as primary Bond Girl, psychologist Dr. Madeleine Swann, is a typical cocktail of adventure, action stunts, explosions and fighting. There are also cosy scenes such as those between Bond and Swann on a train in Morocco.So much for the pros of the film. What about the cons? It is long at well over 2 hours, hence the advantage of watching it at home if possible. There is a fair amount of gratuitous violence with nasty scenes where Bond suffers at the hands of the main villain Blofeld (alias Franz Oberhauser) played by Christoph Waltz. Unpleasant to say the least."

I enjoyed the scenery, the car chase, the airplane chase, bringing back Mr. White and what his role was in the plot after he was shot in the foot at the end of Casino Royale. I just enjoyed the movie as a fun movie, I never look at Bond movies as something that is going to be this Oscar caliber type movie, but a movie that will be fun. I grew up on these movies.

There are dabs of comic relief here and there, and classic 007 elements - from Q's gadgets to John Berry's 007 theme.This movie connects themes and plotlines from the previous entries together, and all ties in crucially to the Bond's mission in this movie and the major villain's sinister plan. A good 007 entry and the best featuring Daniel Craig as the secret agent thus far.Grade B+"

This is very clearly and quite possibly Craig's best movie bar Layercake and one of the best Bond outings, fullstop. 
The beauty of the Bond movie is the homage it pays to all the previous films, the fight scene on the train point in case. Craig smoulders as usual, but this time it is play delicately and with the smoothness a 00 agent should portray.Yes it's another Bond escapade of the usual expectation, yet this time they got it well above par. Craigs previous attempts have been suspect, but not this time.Please ignore the below par reviews, because it easily deserves more than this, anyone who has a big pathetic chip on their shoulder and a keyboard at hand should know better, you are a poor show. Even the worst miserable git would give this an easy 6..Good movie. End of."

" ""SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era""
",0.6486,0.9903,2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"As far as movie franchises go, nothing and no one can touch James Bond. 50+ years and 24 films so far have ensured 007's status as the seemingly immortal superpower of British cinema. If we needed further evidence of this: 2012's SKYFALL became the highest grossing James Bond film ever. In addition, it currently sits in 13th place on the list of highest grossing movies of all time. In short, SPECTRE has a lot to live up to. But if anyone's up to the task, it's Bond, James Bond.The film starts very strongly; an opening sequence that must be regarded as one of the best in the Bond's history. A single tracking shot following Daniel Craig's 007 to his intended target, eventually culminating in a fight onboard a moving helicopter is absolutely thrilling. By the time we've faded into the fantastically realised opening credits, complete with Sam Smith's haunting vocals, the stage has been well and truly set for something quite special.From this point the film makes the most of its bladder-challenging 148 minute running time, taking Bond and company from London to Rome, Tangier and snowy Austria. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography ensures each new location is presented as something resembling an excerpt from a well-produced tourism video. This really is Bond as we've grown to know him over the past 50+ years: he travels, he fights and he's always got time for a quick shag.Daniel Craig has taken his time settling into the role of Bond. CASINO ROYALE was largely devoid of the wisecracking one-liners and suaveness that the previous entries had in bucket loads. As the Craig-era films have progressed, there's been a gradual reintroduction of the familiar character traits, to the point where SPECTRE really feels like Bond is now his old self again, or should that be new self?Another part of the gradual reintroduction of the familiars also came with the first appearances of Moneypenny (Harris) and Q (Whishaw) as well as the man who would become M (Fiennes) in SKYFALL. With the band together at last, Bond has come full circle, and SPECTRE revels in its moments of the fun Bond has with his colleagues, particularly Q.Any good Bond film of course, needs its Bond villain. The casting of Christoph Waltz as the far too mysterious Franz Oberhauser seems like inspired casting. Waltz has a natural flair for the sinister and as previous Bond's have shown; it's not always the more physically astute villains that are the most dangerous. It is a shame therefore that Oberhauser never quite comes across as the villain he could have been. He falls into that easy to step into sandpit of being villainous for the sake of it, a self-explained back-story into the reasoning's behind his villainous ways feels a little underwritten.Providing the perfect contrast to Oberhausen's small stature is his chief henchman Mr. Hinx (Bautista). While his name may sound like something you might name your cat, it's clear from his introductory scene, in which he showcases a particularly nasty way of offing a potential rival, this is one of Bond's nastiest foes yet. A later fight sequence between Hinx and Bond on a train is also very hard-hitting, even for a Bond film.Try as they might, one thing the Bond writers haven't quite mastered yet is the 21st century Bond girl. Previous instances show that an effort has been made to make the new-era Bond girl strong and not always necessarily in need of a man to save them... only to eventually need saving from Bond by the time the climatic events are taking place. SPECTRE's main girl Madeliene Swann (Seydoux) falls nicely into this category.An area where SPECTRE really excels is in some of the smart script work. The MI6 building still stands with the damage inflicted during the events of SKYFALL; a visual metaphor for the state of the British secret service and its perceived perception. This is where Andrew Scott's Max Denbigh (or as Bond affectionately nicknames him: C) comes in. He's a member of the British government intent on bringing down the 00 program as he perceives it to be 'prehistoric'. He is insistent that a global communication of privacy-invading surveillance is necessary to combat the potential threats of this world. He's also a bit of a snarky git. His interactions with M provide some of the film's best bits of dialogue, and also provide this film with its biggest laugh-out-loud moment towards the film's climaxSPECTRE feels very much like a culmination of what has come before in the Daniel Craig-era of Bond. There are many references to the previous films and even a big reveal of a major plot thread that ties all the films together. There are also a few nice knowing nods to previous Bonds (hello, pussy) just to keep the die-hards happy.There are a few familiar Bond fallings that do threaten to hamper the fun at times, but there is enough here to ensure that SPECTRE is one of the better Bond films and certainly the most complete one of the Daniel Craig era."

This had good psychological elements to the story which underscores to be a spy one needs to not only be deadly but brilliant. The film fits well into what makes for a good bond film, tongue in cheek humor, colorful and insidious villains, high tech gadgets, and masterful action scenes among other things."

Most shots are sweeping, wide, and beautiful. The camera doesn't jump from one shot to another twice in the span of a second. There's no shaky cam. The opening shot is a single take that lasts about 5 minutes, from the streets below, to inside the hotel, to on the rooftop - very nice indeed.

It's a BOND film for Gosh Sakes, and well, how much could it suck?As a fan of the books, having read all of them at least 3 times, and having seen all Bond films going back to seeing the first in the theater as a young boy, with my parents, I LOVED the Homage paid to past Bond films, in particular, the opening sequence, calling to mind Live and Let Die, Thunderball, and Dr. No, not to mention the fact that Ian Fleming wrote lovingly about the Caribbean Culture which surrounded his Jamaican home Goldeneye.The action was a good and gritty as any Bond film ever, the sets exquisite, the videography often stunning (opening sequencing decidedly Orwellian). The ending, was most satisfying. The Villains creepy. Believable in Bond world land.Favorite Scene? When Bond creatively dispatches the two hit men sent to dispatch the widow of the assassin he had dispatched. Convoluted? Only in my writing. In the movie, it's Bond at his stylish killing best.I could go on and on, but why bother. Movies are subjective. Maybe I liked this Bond so much, because I expected to hate it. I am so glad, I didn't. If you have avoided it, because you have the same expectations, avoid it no longer. Watch it. Enjoy it. Screw all the bad reviews. But don't let my 5 Thumbs up rating set you up, for a letdown. Forget what I said when you watch.

Even the Bond girls are like a poor mans Ursula Andress or Maude Adams, Honor Blackman - now they had personality and smouldered the silver screen!I would also add that although Dave Bautista was not bad there arent any really memorable henchman anymore - Odd Job , Jaws, Wint & Kidd and even Rosa Klebb with her knife-shoes all had a gimmick and a really memorable part in the movie - the makers seem to miss all these ingredients now and just settle for the standard ""crash, bang, wallop what a picture"" model!This was like all of the recent Bond movies over the last decades - following a boring old formula with a poor mans James Bond actor who brought nothing new or surprising to the character but actually made him seem like a boring old fart in reality with no sense of humour, no sense of style or wickedness like Connery and Moore gave us.To be honest none of the Bonds since Moore have been much good or even on a par with the real Bonds (Connery & Moore)! Even George Lazenby and David Niven were better than any that followed Moore!I give it an average mark because the magnificent Christophe Waltz does his usual superlative performance, he doesnt seem to be able to do any wrong and played the villain with aplomb."
" Does what a Bond film should
",0.0,0.9294,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Spectre' is the 24th Bond film and Daniel Craig's fourth - and final - outing as 007. Is not the best Bond, but nor is it the worst. It does play a lot on nostalgia and the villains/plots (Spectre) of the Moore/Connery eras. It has a lot of classic Bond attributes going for it: worldwide locations (Mexico, Italy, Austria, Morocco), great cars & car chases, plane/helicopter stunts, some sly humour, martinis, explosions and disobeying orders, but it also feels a little tired in places.The plot does well to link in aspects of 'Casino Royale', 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Skyfall', but doesn't really offer much of a driving force, as does Blofeld (Waltz)'s motive as the villain - it's there, but poorly articulated and Waltz is not fully utilised as well as he could be, which is a shame, since we know he can be a great bad guy ('Inglorious Basterds' & 'Django Unchained'). Swann (Seydoux) is also adequate, but never 100% convincing.There's probably too many ""down""/slow moments in a 2 & a half hour film, but at times the score - or lack of, before it kicks back in - is excellent. Q (Whishaw) and M (Fiennes) are both good and get a bit more screen time than usual. The fight scenes are well done and there's plenty of action, but I'm interested to see who the next Bond is - and hope they give us four or five years to anticipate it."

Thought Quantum Of Solace on the other hand was probably one of the worst Bond films ever made. Spectre is way above the level of Quantum Of Solace but just not at the level of Casino Royale and Skyfall. The first half was extremely dull, there just weren't any exciting, exhilarating, breathtaking action scenes. It's when we come across Lea Seydoux's character that the film starts to pick itself up a bit, and the second half of this film I actually quite enjoyed. That's really when it started to become entertaining and enjoyable. Spectre is okay, but I wouldn't put it that high on my James Bond ranking, not even in the top 10.

There was the usual fist fight with a double 'ard henchman of course, but that lasted all of two minutes and was ruined by Bond suddenly becoming punch drunk, despite not getting punched in the head, it just fell totally flat. That was about it for the action, then it was just a load of talky drivel that I couldn't be bothered paying attention to.

" A very short review of ""Spectre"" (2015)
",0.0,0.988,2017-11-09 00:00:00,8,"(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FILM.) ""Spectre"" (2015) was an impressive James Bond film, if not an unforgettable one. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. It's got style, terrific action sequences and absolutely gorgeous shooting locations. Daniel Craig is still a decent Bond, too, even if I always find him a little understated in the role. And Dave Bautista makes a sufficiently intimidating henchman. (The man looks gigantic, too.)It brings little new to the franchise, however, and it doesn't rise above being a standard action film in the same manner as its predecessor, 2012's nuanced and surprisingly emotional ""Skyfall."" (I've gained a greater appreciation for that movie after having watched it a second time.)It occurs to me, too, that ""Spectre"" seems a little easy to nitpick — at least to someone who's enjoyed a lot of spy films and novels that are intended as procedural thrillers. We watch Bond gain easy access to a super-secret meeting of the titular cabal, for instance — he just kinda bluffs his way in. Then the organization's Big Bad calls him out, after apparently feeling his presence, as Darth Vader felt the presence of Luke on a passing ship in ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983). Later, we watch Bond employ incredibly risky and haphazard tactics to rescue a kidnap victim — it seems to me that the consequent random vehicle crashes, explosions and gunshots could just as easily kill her as they might free her.Still, this was a fun movie. I'd recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick."

Just plain boring and tedious to watch."
" Bond goes on a mission to avenge the previous ""M,"" uncover the truth about S.P.E.C.T.R.E, and protect the spy agency he grew up with.
",0.5994,-0.9813,2017-10-17 00:00:00,5,"For almost fifty years, the James Bond film franchise became one of the longest continually-running film series in movie history. Though the twenty-fourth(and the most recent)installment of the series, Spectre, was the second highest grossing James Bond movie(grossing $880.7 million dollars), the film was mediocre, boring and did not live up to the expectations of audiences and standards compared to the previous James Bond movie, Skyfall. Spectre had a 64% Rotten Tomato approval rating, compared to Skyfall retaining a 93% approval rating, and was described by the Los Angeles Times critic, Kenneth Turan, as ""exhausted and uninspired."" Although parts of the movie generally had good humor, the simple plot, unsatisfactory character development and lame fight choreography made the movie dull and predictable.Only the beginning of Sceptre had the best action scenes. Bond tracked down Marco Sciarra and fought him, thwarting a bombing plot on the Day of the Dead. They ended up taking their brawl to a helicopter and Bond killed him by kicking him out of the aerial craft. It all goes downward from there. Afterwards, the quality of action scenes went down from there, there was just the usual car chases, gunfights and tracking down of clues; there was nothing new audiences haven't seen before. There were not enough moments of intense suspense or elements of surprise to keep Spectre watchable. At least the danger levels were so high in Skyfall that the audience clench their armrests and wait for a good fight scene or plot twist to happen. The story line of Spectre is nothing compared to the plot of Skyfall. The reasons why Skyfall had a good rating was because of the way the previous M's past haunted her and the kind of mental toughness Bond had to exert to save the M16 program. Remember, Bond only recently went back to duty after he was shot and left for dead. Naturally, he had a tough time putting down criminals because he was out of practice. The scriptwriters had weaved the story line of Skyfall into a complex story that was more than enough to satisfy audiences. Bond's only ""real"" challenge in Sceptre was to assassinate Oberhauser and save his new girlfriend. His friend and the quartermaster of the M16, named Q, did the majority of the work to save the M16 program from Oberhauser's plot to steal all data from countries around the world. In fact, the movie Spectre made me want to know more about Q than Bond and whether there will be a sequel starring Q. Bond had little to no character development in Sceptre. The only attribute I saw change in Bond was his womanizing(after he started dating Swann). Compared to Skyfall, his character went from a confident agent, to a distrustful broken man and back to a solemn one. His character development was interesting and made sense; Bond was shot and left for dead by the organization he gave his life for, then he was hired back and saw his boss died right in front of his eyes. The fight scenes in Sceptre were definitely not as good as the fight scenes in previous James Bond movies. At least some technique was used in Skyfall. Sceptre fight scenes were based off brute strength but did not feel real enough. There are some rules when incorporating fight scenes into American movies; the fight choreography either has to be just brutal enough to the point that the audience likes it, or it can look brutal but strategically executed, with one move leading to the next. The only strategic thing Bond did in his fight against Mr. Hinx was tie Mr. Hinx's neck with rope to heavy cartons that were rolling out of the train, causing the henchman to fall to his death. In Skyfall, there are way more examples of Bond combines the techniques of using teamwork, analyzing clues and clever use of technology more efficiently to complete his missions. Once again, the reasons why Sceptre was a horrible sequel to Skyfall is that Sceptre did not have a complex plot, Bond's character did not change or develop over the course of the film and the action scenes were just plain boring. This recent installment of the James Bond film series is truly disappointing. Movies sequels are supposed to be better than the prequels every time they are released. If not, how else can movie series retain popularity and show people Oscar-quality films?"
" Bond is Sluggish this time. Martin Campbell is Needed to Reactivate Double-O7
",-0.4019,0.9969,2017-10-14 00:00:00,5,"'I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. We're done. All I want to do is move on,' stated by Daniel Craig about reprising himself as James Bond again in future. Daniel's tediousness towards the most stylish and famous film franchise was unfathomable but after experiencing latest Bond flick ""Spectre"" one can understand what he meant. ""Spectre"" is directed by Oscar winner ""American Beauty"" famed Sam Mendes who is on his second outing with 007. When he was first roped in to direct the most desirable spy who loves to drink shaken vodka martini, he offered us his best by adding darker elements in every character. No surprise ""Skyfall"" emerged as highest ever grosser Bond movie with staggering earning of billion dollars at worldwide box office. Sometimes, overwhelming box office success induces filmmakers to tingle with their own formula which results in mediocre cinematic product. Sam Mendes has done the same thing this time. He starts with a bang in ""Spectre"" but loses his pace very soon. Exaggerated and lengthy focus on content makes this Bond sluggish. Audience loved the James Bond reboot in ""Casino Royale"" which has realistic touch but over emphasizing of new formula in ""Spectre"" takes entertainment element away for which Bond fans always crave for. It seems Sam Mendes is completely oblivion of the fact that Bond movies also belong to same escapist cinema where audience wants to be mesmerized by larger than life characters performing death defying stunts. if we are craving for hardcore realism then every film doctor will never prescribe us volume 007. Sam Mendes should been twitched while directing ""Spectre"" and informed him by whispering in his ear that he is not directing ""American Beauty"".Danial Craig's low enthusiasm for James Bond franchise was a clear indication of his emotional absence from ""Spectre"" though he was physically playing as James Bond. It could be his first film where he was in no mood to impress audience with his acting caliber. Mediocre and dissociate are the appropriate words to describe his performance in ""Spectre"". Oscar winner and volcano of acting talent Chistoph Waltz as villainous Blofeld with his happy-go-lucky charm but mischievous demeanor lifts ""Spectre"" for a while but slow pace of movie makes his impact unnoticeable. Bond girls have always been center of attraction no matter how much feminists criticize the hollowed morality in Bond series because of which leading ladies are presented as an instrument of pleasure to seemingly misogynist James Bond. French actress Lea Sydoux is new bond girl who previously appeared in a cameo role in another espionage thriller ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" in 2011. But Lea Sydoux came under international limelight when her lesbian love story ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" won international acclaim. Though ""Blue is the"" was an explicit over exposure of lesbian sexual encounters but international critics embraced the film wholeheartedly (May be Gays/Lesbians). With her expression less face she has equally matched the level of boredom Danial Craig presents in ""Spectre"". Lea Sydoux is completely wasted. Dave Bautista's character as Blofeld's beefy and ruthless sidekick Mr. Hinx gives adrenaline rush in train fight sequence but his role could have been extended to maintain the interest of action lovers. Ralph Fiennes as ""M"", Naomie Harris as ""Moneypenny"" and Ben Whishaw as younger version of ""Q"" have done their jobs as required by the director. It is worthwhile to mention here about one scene in which Ralph Fiennes tries to explain the importance of Double-O Program to Andrew Scott aka ""C"" by claiming that License to Kill is actually NOT a License to kill which really sounds good. On the whole ""Spectre"" does not offer what hardcore Bond fans looking for. If James Bond franchise still acquires the services of Sam Mendes to direct 25th installment of Bond series then no wonder the charm of 007 will further diminish. Bond producers must rope in Martin Campbell to reactivate Double-O7 because he has done it before not once but twice when he directed ""Golden Eye"" and ""Casino Royale""."

Some idiot reviewers have said it was 'the most boring action film ever'! - were they watching the same film?? Or that they had 'fallen asleep'. Clearly these fools can't watch anything that doesn't have an explosion every ten seconds in it. There's nothing wrong, believe it or not, in a bit of dialogue!! I wasn't bored for a second. I liked the hints of Bonds' background- another thing which oddly offended some- his backstory was much more prominent in Skyfall, and there was nothing wrong with that then or in this film. It added to Bonds' character. I found this film to be as exciting and well done as Skyfall with nice humorous touches and nail biting action scenes. Don't listen to the muppets with attention deficit disorders, this is a fab film."
" The story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation Spectre and their leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld
",-0.5267,0.8897,2017-09-21 00:00:00,5,"A big disappointment. They've tried to go back to the classic Bond- films, but the writing just isn't strong enough. It soon gets predictable and tiresome. Christoph Waltz is a great actor, but isn't given enough to make the villain anything special.The movie opens with an action sequence displaying some great tracking shots, and the opening title sequence is awesome. The movie, photographed by Hoyte van Hoytema has the same great grey and shadow-y look as Skyfall. That still isn't enough to make up for the bad writing and predictable character arcs"
" A positive continuation for Bond, even if it didn't fully meet my expectations.
",0.5574,0.9936,2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Since always the 007 franchise has a special place in my personal cinematheque. I have all the movies and I really enjoy watching them. And although the majority are very good, of course, not all have been good. Some were real disappointments, however much the unconditional fans find it difficult to admit. For me, there is a difference between being a fan and being a blind. I loved to watch ""Skyfall"", I really enjoyed the honors that are made there to several others past movies (it was released during the celebration of the franchise's fifty years, and it made sense to pay these homage). Another point I loved about ""Skyfall"" was the way it made connections to previous films, creating a thread through these films since ""Casino Royale"", and I was excited to see how this was going to continue. And, unlike a lot of people, I've never put any objections to the way Daniel Craig plays Bond nor do I get homesick thinking the previous actors were better than him. Every actor who wore the 007 suit had his time and his personal way of being Bond, and that diversity helps franchise to become richer and appealing. It's my opinion on that. So, as you might imagine, I was really excited about ""Specter"". Of course, the title showed me one thing: Bloofeld was going to come back one way or another. And so it was.As always, Craig was well on the main character. Charismatic and seductive without losing the rough and dangerous look, he never lets us forget that he is a man on a mission. Christoph Waltz was compelling and Machiavellian and rose to the challenge of embodying one of the most iconic Bond villains. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Andrew Scott and Naomie Harris were impeccable in supporting roles. On the other hand, Lea Seydoux is far from being a memorable bond-girl with an uninspired performance, while veteran Monica Bellucci, despite her age, is much more sexy and could have been more interesting if she had a more active and important character. Sam Mendes is an excellent director, with good ideas, good casting skills and what appears to be a long-term plan for future films. However, the excessive length of the film, with a very slow pace sometimes and an ending that is, at least, disillusioning, showed me that this director has some difficulty in post-production work. For example, the pre-opening sequence in Mexico was more worthy of being a movie ending than what I saw in the end. Attempts to make humor or even some romance were also a resounding failure and suspense, that should be growing throughout the film, seem more to come in waves, growing and collapsing to re-grow in the next action sequence. Speaking of action, there's plenty to suit everyone, from car or train chases to truly unbelievable fights. All very well done but sometimes overdone and unbelievable. Soundtrack is unremarkable and Sam Smith's theme-song is boring, effeminate and far from the quality of its immediate predecessor (Adele's ""Skyfall""), to give just one example.Thus, ""Specter"" proved to be a good addition to the franchise and a very positive continuation although, of course, not as good as the film that preceded it. Let's see what will come next."
" Operatic 007
",0.0,0.9951,2017-09-19 00:00:00,7,"You need to know that I'm writing this review never truly warming to the tone the Bond franchise took post Brosnan. I preferred the happy-go-lucky Bonds of the past compared to this new 'darker' Bond for the 2000s. However, I learned to appreciate that 'Casino Royale' was actually a good film. It wasn't what I'd call a 'Bond film' but it was a decent spy thriller. 'Quantum of Solace' just seemed to be an 'add-on' to 'Casino Royale,' but I felt that the series was taking a few tips from the past by injecting a little ore humour into 'Skyfall,' therefore making it the best of the trio (in my opinion). Now, having sat through Craig's latest turn as the invincible superspy, I feel that it was a hard watch.Yes, it retained a little humour which I did appreciate and the action was there. It was just the direction which seems to irk me. The previous film (and my favourite you may remember!) was directed by our own Sam Mendes who I thought did a great job. Therefore I was a bit surprised when I didn't like his style any more. The closest I can describe it as was when Homer Simpson ran a plough business and tried to boost his sales by making a pretentious black and white advertisement which had loud operatic music, beautiful women and no relation at all to the service he was providing. This is what I felt when watching many long drawn out scenes in 'Spectre.' Loud opera music, slow moving people and grandiose locations. It all felt really over the top – and not in a self-knowing good way. It just screams that it's trying really hard to be deep, meaningful and artistic, yet all it's doing is coming across like a bad advert for posh perfume.So, that's the bad out the way, now on to the good. The action is there, but (and I know I watched it on a popular online streaming service rather than on a big cinema screen) I felt like I could tell which explosions were computer-generated and which weren't due to a weird graininess of the picture (I stress – this could have been down to the quality of my broadband, so I'm reasonably forgiving on this one). I think the best part about the film was actually getting another dose of nostalgia by having our most evil of all Bond villains back again – Blofeld himself.This time he was played by Christoph Waltz who is actually pretty creepy as the – virtually – omnipotent leader of the infamous terrorist organisation. It was nice to see someone repeatedly get the better of Bond and there were plenty of nods back to the previous (Craig) Bond films thrown in there for good measure. The other thing I liked was how Bond didn't actually do it alone this time. In 'Spectre' he was ably aided by M, Moneypenney, Q and some other guy I couldn't quite catch the name of. This made a pleasant change to simply pitting Bond against the world and felt almost a little like one of Tome Cruise's 'Mission Impossible' films.Overall, I'd say that 'Spectre' is a pretty good effort. It's all there if you know what you're expecting from a 'modern' Bond movie. The direction grated on me and I tended to roll my eyes a bit, plus Craig himself was looking a bit tired all round. I've heard the rumours about him not wanting to play Bond any more. Maybe I was looking for signs of this, but I think it shows. However, it was decent enough. I'm interested to see where it goes from here, as it's clear that the franchise is technically 'ongoing' as opposed to the old 'stand-alone' Bond films."
" Weighed down by the spectre of Bond (get it?)
",0.0,-0.9743,2017-09-13 00:00:00,5,"WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS (sort of) This movie helped me work out why the only Bond films I tend to like are the first in a new series by a new actor playing the titular role. The series is locked in a never ending series of nudges, winks and nods to the past. Each new Bond attempts to reset this and does so to a degree, e.g. the 'tough' Bond we get played by Daniel Craig (There's no way Pierce Brosnan is sitting naked on a chair getting his balls smashed in), but then it slopes steadily back towards the tropes that define Bond as a whole. This guy is a hardened killer, he could stab himself in the leg and his heartbeat wouldn't raise. Daniel Craig is a good actor so we believe this too, we buy into the fact that Bond as we now know him is athletic, hard as nails and will stop at nothing to get the job done - yet we are asked to believe that he can fall in love once every two years? That this husk of a human being can fall victim to his emotions on such a regular basis? It's these staple Bond-isms that kill the pace of the film and take you out of the moment. We open with Bond taking some woman up to a room, only to then hop out of a window to kill someone. Why?! Who the f**k is she? Is she now a witness that needs to be murdered? I assume this bit is there just to remind us that Bond loves to f**k, but he was never going up there to have sex, he was out of that window straight away. Then later we get Bond showing up at a funeral to seduce the widow, like Will Ferrell in Wedding Crashers. There is no cause for it and it doesn't suit the tone of the film, the information he gets from this could have been acquired a million other ways. Then we finally get Madeleine, who tells Bond no and you think 'wow, finally'. Oh but wouldn't you know it, we get a boring romantic scene on the train where Bond reminds us that in his world no means yes. This only serves to end the film like most other Bond films where the who-gives-a-s**t love interest is in peril and Bond can do his dead-eyed, sad clown without makeup face.Overall this isn't a terrible movie, it looks great and there are some cool set pieces, but it struggles to get to the point because it has so many historic boxes to tick. Do we have to go to Q's office in every film to see some inventions? Can Bond just do one cool thing without adjusting his cuff? Can 'M' stop being surprised that after 50 years of doing whatever the f**k he wants, that Bond has just done it again?There is a lot of detail to this film that requires you to give it your full attention, but you will find yourself going blurry eyed and missing it because it repeats so much that you don't realise when you need to check back in. You really expect me to recall the identikit post-2000 billionaire villains from the other movies in this franchise whilst also trying to force out a s**t to give about MI5 and MI6 merging?? Some people are saying Daniel Craig doesn't look like he enjoys the role anymore, but I think its the opposite. I think he's in too deep, he looks as laboured and drained as this Bond should be. He kills people for a living and has no life, even Moneypenny gives him s**t about this. I suppose that's something new at least."
" Waltz Makes It Worthwhile
",0.34,0.8973,2017-09-09 00:00:00,7,"A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ""Casino Royale"", making its appearance in ""Spectre"" its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than ""Quantum of Solace"", making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back..."
" I Really Miss Sean Connery
",-0.2247,-0.9634,2017-09-06 00:00:00,6,"This movie isn't terrible, and I am a huge fan of the Bond Franchise, no matter who is playing Bond. I always give them a chance. Casino Royale was good with Daniel Craig, but since his debut film as 007, I just don't like the departure from past portrayals. It is as if the people who produce movies and music today want to fundamentally change the feel and layout of the franchise, genre, or film they are doing. What has happened with Bond reminds me of what happened with 2017 country music. They just say something about a small town and put R&B or pop music in the background, and call it ""country"". Then the radio and TV promote it on ""country stations"". It isn't country at all. Sam Hunt is not country, just like Daniel Craig in the last 2-3 movies is not really James Bond. It is more like a Chuck Norris action movie. I love action, and even the gritty style in some of the Bond films, but these seem to be lifeless, with no humor or charisma. Craig plays the part like a soulless robot(who actually looks like a muscular keebler elf at times), and some of his films like Skyfall and Quantum just seemed like a meandering mess. Lame villains? fighting it out in a home invasion in the countryside? Going into retirement? Something is missing, and I feel that they really need a new icon and maybe they are just running out of ideas."

I like high production quality and some good visuals effects, the movie is more realistic than other films. But i miss the long story of a Bond-movie like ""Casino Royale"", the action scene in this movie was good, but to short and not so great like Casino Royale. I hope the next Bond-movie will be also great and with long story and also high quality action. You must watched it."

So one who doesn't understand this may find it boring or naive or predictable. But this movie has almost everything requested by the genre: decent plot, a superhero (many fights but not a scratch, a lot of shootings but runs out of bullets only when he wants to), beautiful women, beautiful filming locations, car/airplane/helicopter/boat races, traveling all over the world without a suitcase but always appropriately dressed including white, buttoned tuxedo for dinner on the train. The villain (and his cat) are well known from before, yes it is predictable, our hero will prevail and so what? Two and a half hours packed with action, fun and beautiful pictures.

From Casino Royale to Spectre, James Bond has come full circle in arguably the best performance since Connery. To bring back Blofeld, and Spectre after a 30+ year absence, is a stroke of genius. The opening of Spectre alone, was worth the cost of admission to me. Like the title of the first featurette on the Spectre BD, Bonds Biggest Opening, it certainly is. This film really captured the essence of the greatest Bond films, and tweaked them to suit our time. I can easily call this one of my favorite Bond films now, as it has everything that made me love Bond films in the first place. Im also very pleased with the transfer of the BD and the color palette. Folks really need to understand the look of this film on BD is the INTENDED look of the director and D.P. and not shortcomings of the BD."
" Bond by the numbers
",0.0,-0.9873,2017-07-24 00:00:00,6,"Before I say anything critical of this Bond entry, I will prefix it with the assertion that the film IS entertaining, and reasonably fun. A movie's basic job is to engage, and on that level, it manages it reasonably well.However that is basically the major highlight of the production, with slight visuals and spectacular set pieces failing to mask a flimsy story, wooden acting and a hammy ending.In Spectre, a beleaguered and frankly bored-looking Daniel Craig once again takes the Bond reins - he appears randomly in Mexico in a fairly impressive 'one take' opening scene which lasts a seamless five minutes if not longer, and is enjoyable as much for the novelty of it as the digital trickery. Bond is after some guy and once he takes him out, pursues his wife, who in this case he is defending. Then convoluted plot about digital surveillance, information being power, and nemesis-esque characters appear and frankly you give up trying to make sense of the story.The problem with Spectre is how utterly meaningless all the meaningful stuff is - it tries to moralise about various aspects of its own plot and winds up making them look completely vacuous. And Daniel Craig does his job by the numbers, quite frankly going through the motions more than ever and making it look like his time as Bond is up. Given the utterly bizarre ending in this one, he probably thought it was.The set pieces are decent, but overblown. From the idiotic helicopter sequence to the even worse airplane one, there is a sense of director Sam Mendes trying far too much to impress and managing to parody the living daylights (pun intended) out of action movies.Meanwhile we still don't really know what the story is, or who this or that bad guy is or why on earth Bond ended up with that sultry chiquita.The problem is how badly it's all cobbled together. There is actually a basis for a decent story here, about how Bond appears to be going off the rails and losing his way, but it's never handled carefully enough for us to believe he's losing the plot - MI5 want him suspended through poor conduct and yet we know he's in the right - we never believe he's turning rogue or struggling.It's all a bit vague, messy, and while it's daft fun and not worth losing sleep over, two mediocre or worse movies of four from Craig is a pretty poor hit rate. His saving grace is the strong ones are both outstanding.Personally I think it's time for a new Bond - he was a good Bond but he struggled with this mess and while he's supposedly involved in the next one, I'd call it a day."

I can honestly say it was interesting, addictive and action-packed at ALL times. You won't want to take your eyes off the screen because so much goes on in it constantly!

" A Lesser Whole Than the Sum of its Parts
",0.0,0.9818,2017-07-10 00:00:00,5,"Daniel Craig's fourth mile on the Bond treadmill, and with each installment he's gradually become more gentleman spy and less Jason Bourne in a tux. This time he's squared up against a reimagined Blofeld, played by a characteristically snooty, Machiavellian Christoph Waltz. On the surface that seems like good casting, but in practice it's something of an awkward fit. Perhaps the villain's somewhat uninspired master plan has something to do with his struggles. I know the threats of leaked personal data and unwarranted surveillance are hot topics in today's political spectrum, but this hardly seems like a grand scheme worthy of a vast, international criminal enterprise and the dogged attention of MI-6. Still, Bond and Blofeld find a way to spin that into a deranged torture scene, giant fireballs in the desert and a helicopter chase through the heart of London, so props for navigating such a bizarre progression. In fact, each of Spectre's action scenes are spectacular when removed from the larger narrative. We're rarely more than ten or fifteen minutes from the next chase via land, sea or air, and though we revisit several vehicles and locations, each pursuit feels fresh and original. There's a great sense of power and impact in each, but also an impressive knack for scale and, surprisingly, grace that ties it all together. Too bad the accompanying plot is overlong and monotonous, somehow both thin and under-explained. We skim from one location to the next like a sightseeing tour, but that often seems like it's more for show than to further the story. It's a shame, because in some senses this is the franchise is at its best - Dave Bautista's Mr. Hinx, for example, fits in right alongside the franchise's classic henchmen - but in others it's an undercooked egg. A more daring conspiracy and better character motivation would've made this worlds better."
" the James Bond franchise should have ended decades ago
",0.0,0.9268,2017-07-10 00:00:00,1,"Back when Sean Connery played James Bond, the movies were all about him being a suave dude who bedded a bunch of hot babes. He left the role because the movies were getting too tacky. By the time that Pierce Brosnan rolled around, the movies were nonstop gimmicks. When 2006's ""Casino Royale"" got released, a bunch of reviews called it the best Bond movie in years and said that it had brought the franchise back to its roots. I eventually saw the movie. Sure enough, just more gimmicks. The 1967 ""Casino Royale"" is the good one.And so, ""Spectre"" is still more gimmicks, and mark my words: Daniel Craig is NO Sean Connery. I'll admit that Léa Seydoux is a real babe, but that doesn't cut it. I have no plans to ever see ""Quantum of Solace"" or ""Skyfall"". I don't care how many people praise them. This franchise wore out its welcome mat decades ago. Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Revolutionary Road) should be ashamed of himself.Avoid it!"
" It's a big misfire.
",0.0,-0.9791,2017-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Spectre is certainly not the best 007 film and I don't think it's Daniel Craig's fault entirely. He's just being the same 007 as he has in the three previous 007 films, bland, glum and brooding. So why did this film fail to capture the reason why 007 movies were once so fun? Mendes is good at orchestrating stunning cinematography, camera angles and such. But why does the whole 2.5 hours of film seem to drag on and on? My assertion to this flop is that everyone involved is misused. The characters' roles are either too brief, too underdeveloped or just poorly conceived. Lea Sedoux, although beautiful, is just too boring to watch. Bloefeld is too effeminate and odd to be taken seriously. That whole scene where he is torturing Bond is just goofy and insipid. Bloefeld just isn't sinister our cunning enough to engender much fear or awe. And what about Monica Bellucci? She was the best addition to this film and she's completely wasted. Her eight minutes of screen time are the best minutes of this movie and her role ends way too briefly. Her coy allure sets a stunning backdrop to the cold and desolate funeral procession. The chemistry between her and Craig is palpable and far more interesting than the, bland as goatmilk, Sedoux.It's a shame they couldn't combine all the good aspects of this movie and construct something exciting. The result was a wasted opportunity."
" Hard to Rate This; First Half Okay, Second Half Bad
",-0.4588,0.9447,2017-07-07 00:00:00,4,"Overall, I recommend watching the first half, and just stopping the movie half way though, or skipping from the half way point to the last ~15 minutes.What stood out to me from this movie, is that this seems like an attempt to return to the more classic Bond type of film. He's overly aggressive with his approaches on women, just like classic Bond, and the action is absurdly unrealistic, again like the classic films. But the action scenes are so well choreographed, that it's easy usually easy to over look. At least for the first half of the film. However, the absurdity of the action, and the way some characters seem to escape what seems like certain death, without explanation, starts to become annoying and detract from the story. Sub-conflicts that should have ended sooner, and progressed to the next plot point, just keep going and going.There isn't enough substance to this movie to justify its length. Although the premise certainly had the potential to justify the length, if the story had more to it. I usually feel that the typical 90 minute length of movies is too short, and am a big fan of longer movies, in theory. But the writers only wrote enough for a 90 minute movie, yet this was stretched out to 148 minutes. This movie could have been decent if they cut to down."

Opening is above avg Bond opening and car chase is great. The problem is that pretty much everything about Blofeld is silly. The story, the acting, the stupid banter/insults while torturing, the surviving a huge explosion looking like he was in a sword-fight ... all silly. I loved Waltz in a couple of films, but he plays Blofeld like he plays every other character & almost ruins the last half of the film."

" Sam Mendes misunderstood the goal.
",-0.34,0.9439,2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"What made Martin Campbell's Casino Royale, and Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace an innovative success? It was not the plot, full of twists as many other Bonds in past. It wasn't due to the special effects, which were much used in Brosnan's movies too. It was not the English charm of Craig, and I do not need explanation for this. Well, I worked on my theory and finally I decided that existed 3 Bonds in total, in spite of the seven actors who played that role. The first Bond was The Bond: Sean Connery; a strong super human, charming, the embodiment of perfection and courage, with a special agent's physique due role. He was the real incarnation of Ian Fleming's character. Then all the other Bonds till Craig and finally, the third, Daniel Craig. However Craig lost the mysterious charm that was surrounding Connery, he brought back Bond in state of credibility. Craig was suffering, really suffering. He had pains, addictions, age, he definitely had really human problems. And many time, during the first two movies, he was overcoming seemingly insuperable obstacles, in a very human way: just fighting. He was fighting such as anybody, with a survival instinct, would do. For sure less charming of the predecessors, but more credible, and closer to the audience that could finally identify themselves with a new super human. He made possible to transfer the state of super humanity to the spectator. This has been the key of success of the Nolan's Batman too, but this is another story. I won't go further and I do not want to spoiler. I gave a disappointed 4 stars. The last Bond missed all these aspects, resulting in some granted, lacking surprises, sometimes ridiculous but very expansive and megalomaniac movie. The decline started already with Skyfall, and was very noticeable in the apex. But – at least – it was ruined only the final. I cannot save almost anything of this last Bond. I just save the very cured movie photography, the locations, and few other things. I hope the next movie won't be directed by Sam Mendes, who misunderstood this: nobody wanted an ""expansive Steven Seagal's movie"" (and Steven played in better action's movies then this one)."
" Cummulative Review For 007 Agent James Bond Starring Daniel Craig
",0.0,-0.8205,2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"Even though I watched 007 Agent James Bond Spectre at Cinestar Varadin November 2015, somehow, I feel the need to write a cummulative review for 007 Agent James Bond starring Daniel Craig which means from 2006 until 2015. I only liked watching a Daniel Craig as an agent from 2006 Casino Royale and that is because of Eva Green. I am not sure why others watch James Bond, probably for gadgetry, but I watch James Bond not for a bonding with James but for his girl. Namely, I am a girl and girls love fashion. Bond should be all about girlie fashion. Eva Green was fashionable. And the story with Craig should have stopped there. I really hated James Bond starring Daniel Craig themes, I puked all over the world because of an erased Adele and her theme Skyfall. Awful. Should I okay such an erased stupidity. No, I should not and I did not. I am not okaying as I write nor speak. Than Spectre came along and I was like, maybe this time, James would be something to admire to. But it was even worse than with Skyfall. An introductory part of the Spectre showcased Monica Belucci and it would be all well and good if Monica with her fashion impressionism was a James Bond girl. I am really unhappy with Daniel Craig starring a 007 James Bond.

",-0.6588,-0.5389,2017-05-29 00:00:00,1,"I was really enjoying the Daniel Craig Bond movies until this one came out. In all honesty, I can't remember anything about the film whatsoever, except that I absolutely despised it. I did not watch the entire thing, and that makes Spectre the ONLY Bond movie I gave up on throughout the entire series, from Whatshisname to Connery to Moore to Dalton, Brosnon and Craig. This movie will disappoint like no other in a collection of over 20 films. I came back to rate it because I see it's a 6.8 right now, and that is hugely misleading. Kids who haven't seen any other Bond movies may like it, but that's the only demographic that will. It absolutely sucks!"
" uninspired and disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9912,2017-05-24 00:00:00,4,"This work includes all fan-service expected from the franchise: babes that will fall madly in love with the character after two minutes of knowing him and after the guy tells them he killed their loved ones, playing with cool gadgets so everybody sees he is a spy, bad dudes that instead of shooting him in the head when he is standing in front of them first they have to tell him their convoluted plan and leave him for a convoluted death after they leave the room, being so awesome that bullets fired from a close distance don't touch him yet he kills all the bad guys with his eyes closed while keeping the balance over the nose of a shark while he juggles chainsaws over the top of a volcano (because he is that awesome).. OK, I am making things up, but he is awesome, all babes love him after just seeing him the first time (I wonder if that also happens in real life to the actors that characterize the guy).. and all that stuff. That's not the disappointing part, since that is actually the reason everybody would go see a movie of the franchise; though is getting old rather quickly.But concerning inspiration.. this movie comes from a plot arc where we wanted to know who killed his loved one, then who kept killing the loved ones from the following movies (and so on).. and we wanted to know what was with that; which one was the sinister organization that was making him miserable and was hinted in all movies (except previous one) where the character was represented by current actor.How about uninspired: it turns out all terrorism around the world, all evil was orchestrated by an unknown step brother, who organized all world terrorism expecting that specifically him, who would become a spy, would deal with the most cliché villains (including the one from the previous movie that was not related with this arc), and also expecting to kill his loved ones.. and it was all because of brother jealousy. And only he could save the world, while some other guy tries to stop a world wide system that will doom everybody but it starts after a countdown (instead of just some guy pressing 'enter') and that apparently can not be stopped after it starts (it's not as if after discovering the system was bugged they could just say 'stop the system' or something like that). Boo hoo. I mean.. how pathetic can you get when creating a story to justify the supposedly evil organization.."
" It's so sad to see James Bond being dragged through the mud
",-0.5563,0.7234,2017-05-18 00:00:00,1,"I have been a fan of James Bond for years and every bond film was good up until Daniel Craig took on the role. In 2006, the James Bond films changed. The original creators were now no longer part of creating the films and the new generation has taken over and because of this change behind the scenes, it's had a major effect on what we see in the films. The James Bond films that star Daniel Craig are terrible! He looks nothing like the original character. His presence on screen isn't suave and sophisticated (he has a typical lad look about him). The gun barrel sequence was removed which was an iconic trademark that draw your attention to the screen straight away and it was one of the elements that made the James Bond series different and unique to all the other spy thrillers. The one liners and double attendres that made the films a bit more fun have been removed to make the films more serious which James Bond was in the books but isn't in the films (there is a difference which the new generation has not got a grip of). The iconic sets and outfits have now been made to be more subtle and somewhat boring. The clever intelligent script writing has been changed to suit a more action packed film with no real substance. The iconic villains and bond girls are now just men with a grudge against humanity and girls who get 2 seconds screen time before they are put away to give center stage to an actor who doesn't even really want the role himself. The elements that made James Bond, James Bond, have all been removed to suit a brain dead audience. It's sad to see that most of the new generation of film watchers actually prefer Daniel Craig's half arsed attempt at filling the shoes of the iconic hero, when all the actors who preceded him created something magical that will stand the test of time. The older films were innovative and creative. They were fun and dignified. The were typically British and iconic. They gave us an insight to the times when the films were made. There was so much to the older films that is overlooked. The new films will be forgotten in 20 years. The 5 actors before Daniel will always be remembered. My opinion, is that really matters in film making, but then again, some directors don't care about that and just make something predictable and unoriginal to make money and this film made the money... but that's it."
" Lower your expectations and you will enjoy it for its action and its quick wit
",0.25,0.9975,2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"After the colossal success of Skyfall director Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig return to bring Bond's origin story to completion. It is a bumpy ride.Bond is on the ropes once again at the MI6, M has him grounded after he causes chaos in Mexico City while hunting down a man the previous M had secretly instructed him to find. This leads Bond down a path to further discover his past, and a conspiracy that links all his previous missions. Meanwhile, MI6 faces a merger with MI5 to become a new intelligence agency without need of double-oh agentsIf Skyfall was The Dark Knight, Spectre is The Dark Knight Rises. With its previous instalment being such a huge success as well as being incredibly unique in the now twenty-four entries of the franchise, Spectre is completely up against it. Unfortunately what appears to be a more traditional Bond film from the outset, is exactly that. Spectre (or correctly spelt: S.P.E.C.T.R.E) relies on a lot of mystery and a lot of setup in its task of tying up the underlying plot of the last three films. But avid fans have already called it out; much as with the ""twist"" of JJ Abrams' Star Trek Into Darkness, Spectre's title isn't the only problem undermining the film's attempts at mystique. It feels like an conspicuous attempt to remake the series.The film is surprisingly slow and sporadically paced (a bit like Sam Smith's whining, warbling theme The Writing's on the Wall, which has not improved with time) especially for a Bond film. We leap from location to location at the drop of an editor's hat. Most of the story is expositional and setup for a payoff most people already know is coming. The dissolving of MI6 is positively dull, Ralph Fiennes as M working with an unimaginative script, a battle of wits with Andrew Scott (Moriarty from BBC's Sherlock totally not playing a villain) Action scenes are haphazard and quite baffling. Compared to Skyfall's train-top earthmover stunt, or the fight in Shanghai, Spectre has you more likely scratching your head asking Bond what exactly he hopes to achieve. A lot of stock is put into Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) as Spectre's silent lead muscleman (who has apparently watched too much Game of Thrones) but apart from an excellent punch up in a train, his scenes feel more like the completion of a checklist than anything relevant.It isn't all bad though. It earns respect for thematically tying the last decade worth of Bond films together, heck it even references the often reviled Quantum of Solace more than once! The film is in line with a more traditional Bond experience: a globe-trotting plot; a larger than life villain henchman who hounds Bond at every turn; a romantic train journey; isolated super villain hideouts; a comedic edge to proceedings. Indeed, if one thing saves the film it is actually the comedy. Bond and Q have a great chemistry still. Christoph Waltz as the villain of course is good, although he is playing the character he has always played. If Daniel Craig's Bond films are the first films you are watching, this works as a decent segway into more from the franchise, even if it is a clear sign that the future will be either more derivative or remakes.It has none of its predecessor's smarts or uniqueness, and while it is perhaps the most fun of Daniel Craig's films it is laboriously slow at getting to the point. Skyfall was a peak that Bond perhaps will never attain again, and bringing back a reluctant director and lead actor to capture that lightning once again was likely a mistake. While the predecessor was a celebration, this is more of an homage.Lower your expectations and you will enjoy it for its action and its quick wit, its more classic Bond call backs and Daniel Craig still delivers Bond's more severe personality well. But I found it a slog to get through, with too much setup for a reveal that was completely expected."

BANGGG... it really hit me like the old ones. It drove me through ups and downs lefts and rights with lots of surprises. I felt like a child again with eyes wideee opened. Ah yes it was wonderful.

It had had it's dull parts and at times the plot was a little predictable, but it also had some quite enjoyable action sequences and the story wasn't that overly boring.The characters were used well and were definitely not as flat and boring as some from previous bond films, and it revisited the character of Blofeld and his link to the character of James' younger years. It also delved a bit into the Spectre organization and it's attempts to infiltrate the governments of the world.So on the whole I thought it was a decent film, and for anyone deciding on this film, I'd recommend you see it as I think you'd enjoy it, it's one I will watch again..."

",0.0,0.0024,2017-03-30 00:00:00,1,"James Bond is K.N.A.C.K.E.R.E.D. All the writers and producers can do now is lean back on the older Bond movies, taking scenes out of previous films and stitching them back together into a new product. Some Bond movies are good, some mediocre and some bad. This one is the latter. In fact this one is up there with Moonraker and A View To A Kill as a Bond Stinkbomb. T.e.r.r.i.b.l.e. - in fact.If Daniel Craig had turned in the sort of brain-numbed walk-through of a performance in Casino Royal that he does here all those internet keyboard warriors would have been right. Craig is clearly bored to death by the role; and so was I with this film. T.e.d.i.o.u.s.The story is about MI5/MI6 being merged and SPECTRE controlling it all. Haven't a clue why - the writers don't seem to know. And enter a villain so obviously working for SPECTRE that you will spot him five minutes after the credits. The Bond song. A.w.f.u.l. T.A.T. Not exactly Goldfinger is it?Bond kills about 200 baddies in this one; most be close to Roger Moore's record by now. The guy is so invincible you might as well stick a superhero costume on him and have done. Bond at the end of his tether.Good cast totally W.A.S.T.E.D. And I want to get totally wasted after watching this.Even when a Bond movie is bad it usually has the saving grace of some well done action scenes, startling stunts, etc. Nothing to see here. This is arguably the worst Bond movie ever for such stuff. It's boring and predictable.Lots of inaudible dialogue in this movie, presumably to hide how bad the lines actually are. Some of them are pretty funny. Not in a good way.SPECTRE and Blofeld. Worst group of villains ever. They are like the Stormtroopers of Star Wars in Armani suits. Blofeld is so weak in this movie it's laughable. Best Bond villain ever, great actor playing him. Result is total C.R.A.P. At least Pleasence, Savalas and Charles Gray had some juicy lines. Henchman. I can't even remember his name. At least Jaws was a laugh in his day. They couldn't think of anything to do with him so they just did a From Russia With Love Red Grant thingy.Bond meets the usual Ice Maiden. Who predictably melts. Hitchcock would sue if he was still with us.Bond's obligatory torture scene is hilarious. ""No, Mr. Bond I expect you to, er,,,lose your memory as I drill into your brain.""No wonder Craig doesn't want to do any more Bond movies - he can see it sliding into the swamp. The relatively serious first three of his Bond movies are way way better then this; even the pretty average Quantum of Solace. I liked his portrayal in those movies - he was the best Bond since Connery. Here he makes Roger M look animated. Just walk away, Daniel.SPECTRE is T.O.T.A.L. G.A.R.B.A.G.E."
" Decent James Bond movie
",0.0,-0.4042,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"The latest edition of James Bond is one of the most expensive films made ever. For this reason alone, even if you have never seen James Bond films, Spectre is worth watching.The opening scene of this movie in addition to the opening soundtrack is well done. It sets the tone necessary to start a great movie. After the start, there are many scenes throughout the movie that have beautiful scenery coupled with thrilling action. However, there are some scenes at first glance that are enjoyable, but in turn have absolutely no meaning towards the impact of the movie. I never felt bored during the movie, and despite a couple of irrelevant scenes, the film progressed forward. Still, I would have liked to see a bit more scenes with the main villain and less violent action scenes during some parts.There was a bit of a plot twist towards the climax, but it was left virtually unexplained, which made it a bit confusing. The ending is decent in my opinion, but many other reviewers disagree. I am more of a fan of the Ian Fleming James Bond novels, but at this point in the Bond franchise, there is not much from the books being used anymore (aside from character names). There are some major thematic alterations from the books which left me unsatisfied, but I think this is necessary to capture the progression of the Daniel Craig Bond throughout the four films he has acted in. I should note that watching the other 3 Bond films with Craig is useful for understanding more in this film, but it is not completely necessary."
" Good Movie
",0.4404,0.9075,2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,This is a great movie with full of action. But I must say an action movie must be based on reality not something super natural. But in the end I would like to rate this movie seven out of ten due to the story line. All the characters did great work. Also one of the best movie of 2015.
" The weakest of the Daniel Craig Bond films
",-0.5106,0.3922,2017-03-01 00:00:00,2,"The ending of Skyfall was very promising, as it showed James Bond finally manning up and becoming the brilliant secret agent that everyone knows once again. He was ready to take on new missions and possibly provide more stories that could expand on his character. Well, we got a partially traditional Bond, and it sucked. If not for other disasters like Moonraker and Die Another Day, I would call this the worst of the Bond films. Why, might you ask? Well, for one thing, the film is too long and too slow. Two-and-a-half hours is pretty extreme for a Bond film. Yes, Skyfall was slightly shorter, but it truly felt like ""the"" epic Bond story that gave people something special. Here, we have a typical Bond adventure that has additional pieces of filler that we didn't need like the talk about drones and surveillance that Skyfall weaved into its story much better. Other old Bond tropes come about that I'm really tired of at this point; it's been a while, though, since I've seen an action scene on a train in one of these movies.Another problem is the performances. Ralph Fiennes is fine as M and shows himself to be very capable. Ben Whishaw is also good as Q, and he's almost as fun to watch as Desmond Llewelyn was in his Bond films. However, Craig is inconsistent this time as Bond. Sometimes he looks invested, but other times he looks tired. Lea Seydoux was also very dull as the newest Bond girl, Madeline Swan, and Christoph Waltz as Blofeld (let's not kid ourselves here) sucks. He's more like an annoying cartoon villain I would have expected from some of the earlier films than a worthy threat. He's no Le Chiffre or Raoul Silva. And the fact that Bond didn't just shoot him dead at the end like a truly tough Bond would left me feeling very unsatisfied.The story is that after a mission in Mexico that he undertook himself, Bond is suspended from field duty and undertakes a secret mission when he finds a video that has M telling him to seek out a specific target if something happened to her (Was there any reason she couldn't have told him about this during the end of Skyfall?). In Rome, Bond finds out about a secret villainous organization named Spectre (not an acronym), and is tasked by Mr. White from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace to protect his daughter, Madeline. Together, they find Bond's believed-to-be-dead half-brother, Franz Oberhauser, who claims to be responsible for the events of the previous three films(????). This is basically the main plot condensed into a single paragraph, unlike the movie. Hmm.....The big ""twist"" about Oberhauser being responsible for the previous films and being Blofeld is what ruins the rest of the film for me. It clearly demonstrates that the film can't decide whether it wants to be a traditional Bond adventure, or a more serious adventure like Casino Royale. The whole backstory is that after Bond's parents died, Oberhauser's father took Bond in and Franz got extremely jealous and offed his dad...instead of killing Bond and making it look accidental for some reason. Then...for some reason he decides to call himself Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Blofeld was his mother's maiden name, conveniently). Then...for some reason he decides to form Spectre and have control of the world. Next thing, he'd be saying that he lost Le Chiffre's money so the events of Casino Royale would happen or that he got Silva out of his jam with the Chinese so he could take revenge on Bond when it was clear that Silva was acting out of more personal motivations. What bull. What in the name of God were you thinking, Sam Mendes? You ought to be ashamed of yourself for allowing such poor writing to be part of your movie. And I'm not invested in Bond trying to rescue Madeline because the performances don't move me.Bottom line, if the 25th Bond film features Craig again, I hope that that film can correct the mistakes of this film. However, as it stands, this is the final Bond film with Craig as of yet, and it's a truly sucky way to end things. This franchise has seen better days, regardless of how few and far between they were."

" Only For Those Who Know Their Bond History (And Even Average Then)
",0.0,0.9825,2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"In 2006, ""Casino Royale"" changed the game in James Bond movies, as it was the perfect combination of great story, cool action, and even relevant character development (something a bit new to the Bond franchise). Unfortunately, that wonderful effort was followed by two clunkers, ""Quantum of Solace"" & ""Skyfall"". ""Spectre"" pretty much splits the difference between the Craig original and the other two sequels, producing a thoroughly mediocre film.For a basic plot summary, ""Spectre"" sees Bond (Daniel Craig) on the outs with M (Ralph Fiennes), as the 00-program is being phased out of British intelligence. As usual, Bond gets sucked into a scandal involving a shadowy figure (played by Christoph Walz) that seems to be behind the dastardly events of all three previous films via an organization called SPECTRE. With the help of Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Bond does some reconnaissance of his own, along the way meeting up with Dr. Swann (Lea Seydoux), who has a personal connection to SPECTRE as well.The main selling point of ""Spectre"" is that, like ""Casino Royale"", it works pretty well as a prequel...at least for those who have seen the previously Connery/Moore flicks. I have seen them all, so (without spoiling them) I can say that there are a number of iconic moments here. The film also hits all the usual Bond cues and does them pretty well.Unfortunately, ""Spectre"" is also a film riddled with problems, such as...-Though SPECTRE and its history may be able to hold my attention, it likely will not do so for more modern fans who haven't ""done their homework"". I was watching the film with a sibling who has only seen the Brosnan/Craig Bonds, and he was pretty much disinterested from beginning to end. Thus, it works as a prequel...but only to an audience that is probably getting narrower as time goes by (seeing how those old Bond flicks don't really hold up all that well). -It should have been combined with ""Solace"" and ""Skyfall"" into one super-movie, where all those plots could have been examined in one whiz-bang type of film. Unfortunately, production decisions have only drawn out these recent Bonds instead of made them tighter. It's almost like after the disaster of ""Solace"", they tried to go back to formula with ""Skyfall"". Of course, then fans said ""but aren't these supposed to be prequels?"", so it was back to prequel-land for this one. -The whole concept of ""Bond girls"", which the franchise now doesn't know what to do with. Nowdays, you can't get away with Bond saving the girl and then, well, you know. That doesn't fly anymore. I'm not saying its good or bad, but I just think the Bond franchise may need to re- evaluate how they use their heroines. Right now, they are trying to have it both ways...adding a beautiful female, but then not really knowing what to do with her. Besides her looks, Swann's character added little to ""Spectre"", and thus her in a ""sidekick to Bond"" role felt strange.All in all, then, I thought that this was a decidedly average Bond effort. As a fan who has seen all the previous installments, it was fun to see the history behind the crime organization most prevalent in them. As stated above, however, I wish that the franchise hadn't drawn out the character so far from his ""Casino Royale"" days. Had they been able to use Bond's love for Vesper and rage at her death (from ""Solace""), his roots (from ""Skyfall""), and his discovery of SPECTRE in one single film, it would have been great. Instead, for probably a number of different reasons (chiefly, we ""can't give Bond too much character development"", right, lest we completely drain the idea well?), that character development was spread over three average (or below) movies.Bottom line: If you are a fan of Bond's history in the older films, ""Spectre"" will at least entertain you (although I can't promise much more). However, if you only know Bond from ""Goldeneye"" on (and I think that comprises a large number of Bond-goers these days), this will be run-of-the-mill at best and confusing/uninspiring at worst. In this case, it's all about what previous knowledge you bring into the theater with you."

Decent believable special effects, no C I G nonsense, and a darned good snappy script. This over hyped over budgeted effort, was a very disappointing production. I have watched it twice, and give it a big thumbs down, it fails in just about every way possible, the story was bad, script worse, action scenes ridiculous, and Spectre info was non existent. What a waste of Waltz, as he could have done with an 18th century composer, to aid his performance. Avoid this, poor daddy trying to tell his kids what the heck is going on, is challenging to say the least."

",0.7184,0.9871,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Spectre is the 24th bond film and Daniel Craig's 4th turn as James Bond. It took me some time to get used to his rugged turn as 007 but I was won over after the superlative Skyfall. This film is quite uneven in its plot and dialogue yet still satisfies. The plot revolves around a cryptic message from the past that sends James Bond on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci, who at 51 is the oldest and undeniably one of the most beautiful Bond girls) the widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organization known as Spectre. Meanwhile, back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of Spectre. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of Spectre, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz. The action sequences are thrilling and Dave Bautista gives a solid supporting turn as a menacing assassin called Hinx. The third act of the film is borderline ridiculous yet solid entertainment none the less that it should satisfy any Bond fan and serves as a superior action movie."
" Traditional Bond at it's best.
",0.6369,0.9986,2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"As a fan of James Bond since childhood, I recognize that a majority of the films are fun escapism; but various tones with different actors and themes that reflect their respective time periods help to give an interesting variety. The 21st Century has seen layered storytelling in blockbuster franchises receive critical acclaim and box office rewards, which I've gone into some detail about in my other reviews. With two hits and one film that's been dragged through the mud under Daniel Craig's sleeve; Spectre while positively received by some fans has received backlash by others.Putting aside all of this and glaring comparisons to Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation; Spectre is a strong chapter in the Bond series. Sam Mendes is one of many directors who has gone from thought provoking Dramas, to translating action scenes with near perfection and being able to handle increasing budgets. Skyfall and Spectre are neck and neck with the scope of their set pieces but are just as entertaining.Almost every scene in Spectre is brewing with energy, whether it's the gunfights, chase scenes or the witty banter between characters including Bond and Q; the film is almost never dull.Spectre makes a controversial yet bold attempt to tie in Daniel Craig's previous adventures into this installment, and for me it mostly works. Allusions to the Patriot Act and the Illuminati are present with Blofeld's master scheme to impose drone surveillance on all of Great Britain, and possibly the world. Secondary villain C's motivations are clear as he yearns for security for the world and believes secret agents are outdated which allows him to be manipulated by Spectre, and his arrogance to get the best of him along with his rivalry with M.Lea Seydoux, fresh off Blue Is The Warmest Colour, is charming and whip-smart as Madeleine Swann, a love interest that surprisingly works. Growing up with an assassin for a Father, she truly understands Bond; which results in her confessing her love for him as he's strapped into a classic torture chair routine by Blofeld.Mr. White is one of the most meaningful characters in the series. He also comes full circle in Spectre; he's not a cheap plot device. His disenchantment with Spectre being involved in sex trafficking pushes him to have Bond protect Madeline; somewhat redeeming both Bond and White.The only deficiency I wish was corrected regards Blofeld's backstory. How did he come to be the overlord of Spectre? How did it tie in with his grievance towards Bond for stealing his father's love? A few flashbacks could've fixed this.So while not everyone agrees with Sam Mendes voyage into more traditional Bond formula; it's surely one of the most entertaining and substance filled Bond adventures yet, that farewells Daniel Craig who is one of a kind in the actors who've gotten a turn at one of Pop Culture's most iconic characters.Grade- B+"

Ever since Snowden, Hollywood has went wild with this government collecting mass surveillance data plot. And this is just another stupid one. One bad guy who wants to control the world and 007 stops him. It copied every cheap action movie sequence you can imagine. Rope around the neck, time ticking bomb in a building, falling villain... you will find nothing new in this. And not to mention, Daniel Craig is one of the worst Bond. He's just an action actor. Not Bond. James Bond is supposed to have this playboy style but Craig just doesn't fit. My fingers and toes cringe when he's in any romance scene."

My advice: After the first truly electrifying 13 minutes, turn this off and keep your happy memories. In this one, Bond goes rogue after receiving a message from the beyond, in a way. He infiltrates a secret meeting and learns about the evil group SPECTRE. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there's a new M (Ralph Fiennes) and a merger with MI5 and a decision to kill the Double O program. Might be a good idea, in fact.Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old enemy, may have the clue to finishing off SPECTRE. A good cast includes, besides Craig, Fiennes, and Seydoux, Christopher Waltz as the head of SPECTRE and Sherlock's Moriarity on PBS, Andrew Scott, one of the best of the new crop of British actors.But all that doesn't help the script. That great budget and no one can write an exciting story. Car chases, sex with women Bond met 2 minutes ago, cartoon villains, torture - it's all there in small enough doses to make the 2-1/2 hours go by like the original Birth of a Nation. I've seen Craig on stage twice - he's wasted here. About as exciting as flipping channels with a remote."

I know we are all equality for women but.. Really? The I.T. villain picks up and aims an automatic pistol at M without noticing its light weight due to no bullets. The whole color of the film never departed from brown and grey. James makes some several consecutive kills with a submachine gun from what looks like 500 yards. They should have used a different lens."
" Another Great Bond Movie
",0.6249,0.9872,2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"To all the haters, Spectre is just another amazing Bond movie. Intensive from the very beginning to its end, very thoughtful and non predictive story, excellent acting and as usual, you never know what would happen until the end. 10/10. I have already seen the movie 4 times!Soundtrack is really a winning side as well. Sam Smith's - Writing's on the Wall is another great compliment to Adele's Skyfall.I truly hope Daniel Craig will accept the next Bond role. He is just the perfect actor to play Bond. With that being said, I can't wait for the next movie."
