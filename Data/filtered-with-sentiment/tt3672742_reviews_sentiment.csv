" Very underrated film
",0.0,0.9045,2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love this film. Very comic booky, funny and gory. I've watched it way too many times and anyone I've shown it to has really enjoyed it. Great post apocalyptic film with a retro futuristic dystopian vibe"
" An eccentric but feel good movie
",0.5927,0.6486,2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,Very little in this movie makes sense but you can enjoy it nevertheless. It's got the gore but is also heart felt .
" Though I give it 9 stars, I wish I could rate it even higher
",0.4019,0.7515,2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,"This comes close to being my favorite movie of all time. I don't think calling it a 'B-movie' does not do it justice, unless you're going to call Evil Dead a 'B-movie'. It's simply very 80s.Where it falls short is that there are a few slower parts, or sequences that could have used a rewrite or reshoot, that stop it from being a perfect movie in the genre for me. But the parts that are good, which is most of it, is just perfect."
" Not for Me
",0.0,0.1901,2021-01-28 00:00:00,3,"This is made for a cult or those who had their childhood in late 80s watching action flicks.I can understand the sentiments of people who rated it high and I agree with them. But for me personally, I had to skip through the movie."
" Mad Max/BMX Bandits
",-0.4939,0.9913,2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"A quality homage to bloody 80s post-apocalyptic wasteland movies. Less high octane than Mad Max but perhaps a more realistic view of a future in which fossil fuels are no longer around; that is to say that all the main characters spend the movie riding around on their trusty bicycles.
Our hero is a innocent and cautious young lad who stays safe by mostly hiding out alone and reading his favourite comic books. But a chance encounter with a quirky, energetic and beautiful stranger leads him on a journey to become so much more.
Visually fun, with some colourful characters and costumes, plus some over the top blood and gore. This is definitely a fun flick and a great throwback to 80s flicks of this ilk."
" god bless!

" Not road warrior, more like roadkill.
",0.4201,0.621,2020-08-02 00:00:00,1,"This film is compared to a mad Max or road warrior film, on pushbikes, with some ridiculous three wheeler pushbikes thrown in. I don't remember mad Max riding a pushbike, with a siren attached to his head, chasing a group of 'bikies,' with Mohawks down the highway. And Jack the ripper would've done it either.Mad Max this film ain't. It isn't in the same league. That film, is a classic. Even the Kevin Costner film Waterworld had more substance. Siam sunset had plot, as did shipping news, even Elysium. As well, as a story line.
The outstanding Australian film chopper, (2000) had more chop to it than this, and wasn't a b film.
Let's not compare this film to mad Max.This film is rated PG. It should be r-rated, as a b film. The characters have hideous names Zeus the tyrannical warlord, who looks like he was brought out of the old people's home, but he and his army, ride pushbikes around, while wearing overalls. And Apple, a woman who clearly is missing a few brain cells.The film looks like it was made by a group of University students.
The special effects are amateurish. The story and plot should've been developed more.The backlot it was filmed on, doesn't resemble any post-apocalyptic world I've seen. It's filled with power poles.The name turbo kid is a misnomer. He doesn't live up to his name. Spiderman, Superman, and man of Steel all lived up to their names. Had there been less violence, it would've made an excellent children's show.If Stargate sg-1 was still running, they would've made a very successful parody of this, which would've been way more popular than this film. And that actually had a soundtrack, and they didn't wear overalls, neither did they ride pushbikes. Even a SNL episode, or a porn parody would make more money, and they wouldn't be called a classic either.The film stars Michael Ironside, why he choose to be in this film, is beyond me. His talent's are wasted here. Aaron Jeffrey, Laurence lebouf, and Munro chambers also star.Please someone make a parody, or kill this film."
" Doesn't get more awesome than this.
",-0.544,0.9565,2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie has virtually everything that I enjoyed as a child and still enjoy today. Post-apocalypse themes, BMX bikes, excellent practical effects, killer soundtrack, likeable characters and god damn Michael Ironside! It's just a fun, honest and heartfelt movie that I get stoned and watch on my birthday every year."
" Yeah!
",0.3595,0.765,2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,Definitely a solid 7. Just a fun movie start to finish.

" A wonderful movie that shouldn't work but it does
",0.3291,0.2732,2020-06-17 00:00:00,9,Turbo Kid is a movie that is well made and works on almost every aspect
" It's Turbo Time!
",0.0,0.979,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"This is one hell of a cheesy B-Movies, but you know what, I really enjoyed it!!Set in a dystopian future (1997!!) where resources are sparse and survival is not guaranteed, the Turbo Kid movie follows a sole survivor who is trying to make a life for himself. A kid, The kid, - comic book fan obsessed with his hero Turbo Rider, all his family and friends are dead, he has his BMX, a safe place to live, he's managing to scavenge enough to trade for food and water, but he's alone. One day a pink haired stranger wanders into his life, Apple, the mysterious stranger who he feels has more to her than meets the eye. While enjoying life a little more with each other's company, Apple and the kid eventually get hassle from henchmen reporting to Zeus - an evil overlord who wants to control and rule everything and everyone. Apple is kidnapped and it's up to the kid to find the courage to rescue her.This is my kind of cheesy trashy crassy B-Movie goodness. This is akin to a Troma style film, without being made by that great production house. Taking inspiration from the likes of Mad Max, BMX Bandits, Tron and goretastic films like the Evil Dead and even the likes of Hobo with a Shotgun - and without a doubt taking inspiration from the decade of the 80's with its neon bright lights, big shoulder pads and heavy synth music - this film has a little something for all you wrong 'uns who find yourself watching it. Michael Munro is the kid, while Laurence Leboeuf is Apple; both do a great job acting out their roles - I was rooting for them throughout. The pantomime villain of the piece, Zeus, played by Michael Ironside is fantastic; he's just begging to be hated. The premise of the film is that modern life ended in the 80's, the 90's is an apocalyptic waste ground which only knew the 80's as a reference point for life, fashion, music, a clothes. As such the film is basically Mad Max on BMX bikes with a bit of Tron, with a sprinkling of Evil Dead - heck, you've even got a Don Johnson/ Indiana Jones/ Ash from Evil Dead style hero in the film. The humour is a little hit and miss at times, the gore sometimes is a little over the top - but those are things I really like!! The set and filming locations in general feel authentic enough, even if it's just all been filmed in a demolished school site.Fun, fun, fun! Giving a nostalgic feel, this low budget action, horror, comedy may not be for everyone, but the audience that like this sort of thing will absolutely love it! 8 out of 10 from me."
" You need a bit more than a rousing synthwave soundtrack to make a good film
",0.4404,0.9924,2020-02-19 00:00:00,5,"This film is 'alright' but is overly reliant on the synthwave soundtrack to give a sense of punch-the-air excitement and adventure, the kind you remember from watching 80's films as a kid, which it is otherwise lacking in.Quite often in fact, the rather upbeat and uptempo soundtrack doesn't really fit what is happening on screen, either because the events are rather dull or the editing is too slow. Or worse, both, like the scene where the punchy music blasts out while we watch a rather lethargically-edited game of tag.Given the rich soil of 80's films and the things we all think about when reminiscing of movies from this period (BMX bikes, adventure, exciting music, friends and the general feeling of magic and wonder), you would think it relatively easy to produce a fun and engaging film that is not only influenced by but is an ode and homage to that period of cinema.Yeah they've got the rinky dinks - the BMX bikes, the kids as lead characters, the sci fi element, the retro clothing and paraphernalia, the sense of adventure, the music. But it falls a little flat and is a little dull.I can't fully put my finger on it but maybe it's the story that is rather bland and uninteresting which makes this seem underwhelming overall.Ready Player One is a much more satisfying throwback to 80's films despite its flaws. Super 8 is a decent throwback too. Yep, they are bigger budget films but it's the substance as well as the style."
" An Absolute Gem
",0.0,0.9689,2020-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie. From the retro production, pulsating soundtrack, tounge-in-cheek vibe, to the heart of the characters.Michael Ironside is great as always as an over the top villain and between him and the retro poster art was the reason I began watching this movie in the first place.Lawrence Leboeuf as Apple stole this movie, and did so with so many great characters on screen. Her perky, naivete, style, and charm made her character an instant cult classic. The film makers did make a short story prequel with her as the main character, and although it's a great addition, I would love to see a feature length film with her as the main character.
""How'd you find me?""
""The bracelet.""
""How to you take it off?""
""Oh, you just don't."" 😂I could go on.
I'm done...go watch this movie, or don't and keep living your empty life, I'm not the boss of you."
" Fantastic!
",0.5983,0.9931,2019-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I just got done watching this film, and found it endlessly entertaining. It's clever, the sets and effects (apart from all the blood squirting and gore...it's post-apocalyptic, what're you expecting?) were great - really immersed you into their world. As mentioned, there is a lot of bloody parts and the like, but they weren't so bad to me. Which is saying something, considering that usually I'm quite squeamish around things of that nature. Don't get me wrong, I did have to turn away at some points - but overall, the use of them often times feels outrageous and comedic. It gives it a fun aspect to it, and something to giggle at. Back to the story and the world portrayed, it was wonderful! The acting was great, too. In my eyes, Munro really shined. I definitely recommend watching this :)"
" Finally, A Nostalgic Film For Me
",0.0,0.9589,2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"The Kid is a typical movie protagonist in his story arc. He goes from being a boy who mostly runs away from his problems. This tactic has served him well in this post-apocalyptic wasteland. However, once he makes friends with Apple, a spritely excitable and scary elfen girl, he realizes that not all things can be out run. With the help of a cybernetic ally enhanced arm wrestling cowboy The Kid dons a space age blaster glove and confronts the evil water baron who killed his family.Ok, so maybe it's not typical in it's particulars but the broad strokes are pretty standard. Character starts weak and flawed. Character is exposed to conflict and mentors/allies. Character confronts their flaws. Character ends movie as a more complete person. Pretty standard stuff really.Where this movie shines is in its surface only treatment of anything resembling an emotional plot point or thematic core. It delves briefly into moments of friendship, family, and personal loss, but only briefly, before heading into another round of nostalgic shots, props, plot points, and of course, stomach-churning laughter-inducing violence. Normally, this would be a strike against a film on the old Michael-Opinion-Meter but not this time.""Turbo Kid"" is a film that knows its appeal is in the blending of Saturday morning cartoons style plot with 'Mad Max' style setting, and slasher flick violence. Because of this, it doesn't spend any more time o developing deep character connections than a typical kid's super hero show. No one watches TMNT and thinks, 'I just didn't buy it that Leonardo and Rafael really cared that much about each other."" If that is the kind of connection you are looking for from ""Turbo Kid,"" prepare to be disappointed.That isn't to say that the film doesn't make you care about the characters at all. It does. In fact the main character I ended up feeling connected to is the one character I thought would be the most annoying.That's a pretty impressive feat. Most movies that feature a talkative, annoying, yet lovable sidekick really land more on the annoying side than the lovable one. At first, that is what I thought this film was falling into as well but as the movie progressed I really found myself drawn to Apple, the flighty, pixie-like, elf who accompanies Turbo Kid on his adventures.Another huge highlight of this film is its gore effects. They are 95% practical and look great. Way better than I was expecting and way gorier too. What this movie gets right about these sorts of gore effects in this kind of movie is that it plays as a gag. The violence never made be feel like it was exploitation. I only found myself laughing out loud at the difference between what I have come to expect from movie violence and the gore in this film."
" Exactly what the posters promisse
",0.0,0.927,2019-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I was realy lucky when i first saw the last 10 min of this Movie in the late late tv on a small tv channel.The next day i directly buy this Movie to wach it.
And its insane it's realy driping of pure esence of 90s the Story is 100% from this Time but also complete fresh and new.
The Soundtrack ,the costumes, the bikes, the time where the movie calls future just everything is pure 90s retro and makes the immersion perfect.I can't say more if you like this classic 90 movies there is a perfect new one !!!"
" Charming but also silly and stereotyped!
",-0.1386,-0.8318,2019-07-09 00:00:00,5,"I was so impressed to see how much popularity this movie has got from 2015 to 2019. So I decided to watch it.
Turbo Kid is very ispired to classic movies, video games and TV cartoons from the 80s. The movie looks like a mix of ""Mad Max"" and ""The Fist of the North Star"" anime.
A 13 years old kid finds a high-tech suit and decide to use it to fight crime and an evil tyrant that turns people into...water.
Cultural references apart I found the movie silly and stereotyped.
The story is thin and full of clichés, the characters are stereotyped and some scenes are unintentionally funny.
The splatter and gory scenes are good, perhaps they are the best part of the movie. Apple is an annoying character (to me) and Frederick looks like a clone of Indiana Jones (or some cowboy performed by Clint Eastwood or John Wayne). The performances are overall ok to me. There are some memorable scenes.
I think the movie would be perfect for kids if it weren't for the gory and gruesome scenes, and it would be perfect for adults if it wasn't for its silly story and characters.Final verdict 5.5/10 (Meh..)
Turbo Kid is charming but its brutal violence and its silliness make it hard to reccomend."
" So much fun, comical amounts of gore
",0.5542,0.672,2019-04-14 00:00:00,9,"So violent but in a silly way, it's ridiculous fun.Thoroughly enjoyed the look of the film, the characters you genuinely care for (and the Laurence Leboef character could have been very annoying, but wasn't).The plot was gruesome with unexpected twists and reminded me of the fun 80s kids films I grew up watching, except with blood and gore, a lot of blood and gore."
" Preposterous but not unentertaining
",0.0,0.9299,2019-04-13 00:00:00,7,"In post-apocalyptic 1995, a youth who models himself on comic hero Turbo Kid takes on the evil Zeus.This 2015 Canadian/New Zealand co-production espouses 1980s sensibilities as it sets its apocalypse at the time when it pretends to have been made. It looks cheap, like 1980s video fare, and probably was. It is set on BMX bikes, like Australian teen films of the era, and features gallons of gushing blood and much fairly amusing gory and unrealistic dismemberment. Oh, and a cheesy synth score.The kid playing lead is OK, if a bit unmemorable. The lass playing his ""girlfriend"" Apple gives what turns out to be an amusing and engaging performance. And Michael Ironside collects a paycheque, but gives good value for it.This really is dreadful stuff, but I quite liked it."

" Good effort
",0.4404,0.9311,2019-03-22 00:00:00,5,"While the filmmakers should be commended for attempting such an ambitious project on an independent budget, you can't say it doesn't show.It's an 80s B-Movie hommage, and may work great for genre fans willing to forgive some missteps, but the general audience might want to steer clear. While there are visually memorable scenes throughout, nothing really feels inspired and the movie manages to overstay it's welcome even at 90 minutes. It starts to feel a little tired very soon, and would definitely have made a much better short.The fact that the effects were cheap can even be charming and the visual style sometimes shines through, but the script problems are unforgivable
The writing is simply tedious, the lines are cringey and although some might say it's a B movie norm, I think this shouldn't be a crutch.Some of the filmmaking choices (shots, angles) were also odd, and the music was very intrusive at times."

" Good design but tropey
",0.2382,0.8695,2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,"This film was well executed in terms of production design/art direction, but it almost pains me to recommend it because the portrayal of female characters is truly pathetic. It really surprised me that a woman was involved in writing it because it falls victim to every trope about women that exist. The only female characters are a mother, manic pixie dream girl trope, and a POC girl whose only job is to stand around and look cool and she gets no dialogue, character development or even a name.This film doesn't even come close to passing the Bechdel test, which isn't the be all end all of the representation, but in any case, this film fails spectacularly. A lot of the dialogue was super lame and redundant and it surprised me that a film with such juvenile dialogue got funding.But the art direction, the production design, the homage to 80's films were brilliant. It's a good film to watch in order to learn from the mistake that was made."
" Crazy little nostalgic number.

" Something different
",0.0,0.9511,2018-05-05 00:00:00,6,"TURBO KID is an enjoyable independent science fiction flick that enjoyed some attention on release from cult and B-movie fans, who it seems to have been made for. It was shot in Canada and funded by New Zealand, and it's very much a budget version of MAD MAX, set in a quarry pounded by acid rain. Vehicles are extinct and characters travel around on BMX bikes while '80s-style pop music plays. The cast is unknown, but the actors give fun, larger than life performances, none more so than guest villain Michael Ironside who still has it all these decades after coming to fame. The film is most notable for featuring a string of exceptionally gory special effects utilising both CGI and prosthetics. The gore is cheesy, camp, and way over the top, very much like the Japanese B-movie cycle of films including MACHINE GIRL and TOKYO GORE POLICE. This alone makes it a fun watch."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9062,2018-04-29 00:00:00,6,"Saw this on the Horror Channel in the UK. It's certainly not a horror movie but a post-apocalyptic fantasy one. A kid dons a superhero costume and takes on evil Michael Ironside with the help of a female robot and an arm wrestling cowboy.
It's pretty fast paced and good fun, Buckets of gore & violence. Ironside as always is an effective baddie but credit too to the rest of the cast."
" Black humor + Tribute

It is a tribute to cheap science fiction movies of the 80's, including film score. I loved it! And one of the reasons why I loved it was... Laurence Leboeuf."
" Smiling from start to finish
",0.4588,0.9476,2018-03-20 00:00:00,8,The easiest way to put this is that they made a film for 10 year old me but knew I'd be mid 30s when I watched it! So much fun. Some of the best kills I've ever seen and the most awesome synth soundtrack ever!

Most importantly, it makes sure to keep the internal logic of the movie sound, so despite the tiny budget, it's a solid movie despite the references and throwbacks. This was everything Kung Fury wasn't!
Imagine if Dead Alive era Peter Jackson made a 80's BMX kids movie."

Fun, action packed throwback to the eighties with a thumping soundtrack and great actors. A superhero movie that rightly doesn't take itself too seriously, all the actors did a great job and the special effects were awesome (DC should of hired these wizards to handle Superman's moustache)."

" Turbo Kid Review
",0.0,0.9964,2018-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The 80s is arguably one of the most influential decades of movie history. Films such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Back to the Future have often been credited as the inspiration of many directors of today's generation. One film series in particular pretty much kicked off the entire post-apocalyptic film genre, Mad Max. Created by George Miller, Mad Max was a series of movies that followed titular hero Max and his adventures in a post-apocalyptic Australia,usually meeting with thieves who are oppressing a certain people and then fighting them in several gun fights, brawls, and car chases. The Series overall while having varying degrees of quality has been a mainstay in pop culture, kicking off many more movies about nuclear wastelands.
 
This brings me to Turbo Kid, a 2015 Canadian sci-fi action comedy made to mimic the over the top action films of the 80s, Mad Max especially. Synth heavy music dominates the soundtrack and the effects are purposefully cheesy. While the movie may not be perfect, it certainly is an entertaining adventure.It's the distant future of 1997, atomic war has devastated the world, what few remains of civilization there are live their lives as Scavengers and Barbarians. Add in the fact that a water shortage is leaving the world thirsty and the one person who controls the water is a mad tyrant, the World is not a very happy place.The Film stars Munro Chambers as ""The Kid"", A scavenger and comic book lover who looks up to his idol, the superhero Turbo Rider. He leads a simple life of collecting junk, selling the junk, and then getting his small rations of food and water. One day, he meets a slightly insane girl named ""Apple""(played by Laurence Leboeuf) who follows him around believing him to be his best friend. The two get involved in a series of incidents that has them end up getting pursued by the leader of the civilization, Zeus (played by the underappreciated Michael Ironside). In order to combat Zues's forces, The Kid takes on the persona of the Turbo Rider, to end the oppression caused by the warlord.The Story does feel generic, hitting beats that can be seen from a mile away. However, where the movie does excel is in its characters. While the acting is (purposefully) cheesy, the characters really do start to grow. Laurence Leboeuf's portrayal of Apple is charming and genuinely funny in some parts and with a twist midway through the movie, Her character gets deeper and you start to feel for her even more. Another should be given to the previously mentioned Michael Ironside, of Total Recall fame. His performance is so over the top but not too much to where it belittles his character, even though his actions in the movie is mostly played for laughs.Speaking of laughs, the movie's comedy is hit and miss. There are some jokes and actions that made me laugh, while others were..OK at best. Most of the comedy comes from action, more specifically the heavy amount of gore in the film. Many heads and body parts get cut up, usually with heavy sprays of blood. While Gore in movies can go overboard sometimes, mainly using it for shock value, This movie uses it well, The setting in the film is built well enough to make the gore seem like the kind of action that would occur in their world. The fight scenes could have been handled better though, with some of the hand to hand combat looking extremely cheesy. But in a way, that's the whole point of the movie, to be cheesy. The world, the characters, the story, the action all is made to mimic the cheesy feel of 80s action films. It wont leave you with any lasting message or theme. Its main goal is to entertain and to that end, I genuinely enjoyed the movie. I can easily recommend it to any fan of action movies, and sci-fi movies, especially if you enjoyed 2014's similar film ""Kung Fury"". 3/4 stars: Check it out."

" Weirdly compelling, fun story
",0.4588,0.945,2017-08-08 00:00:00,7,"This movie illustrates what happens when the director/producer can tell a simple story very well with layered characters. Films that are internally consistent and coherent can be wonderfully fun.Okay, the last act is a little bit of a let down, but the rest of the story is so well told it's still good.Don't watch if: you don't like gore. The gore gets more and more over the top so that by the end it is a straight up parody of itself. Then again, it's mostly played like the gore in Monty Python (with some better effects).Do watch if: you like wonderful, quirky post-apocalyptic movies."
" Don't Make me throw a disc blade at you
",0.0,0.9635,2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"Hilarious movie, with quality substance, quirky action, upbeat atmosphere, bangin soundtrack, fun plot, enjoyable characters and unexpected events. SPOILERS This movie is the perfect length, it had some questionable moves with the android girl, I thought the fact that some kid on a bike finds a megaman-esque gauntlet and uses it to kill a disc-gauntlet guy was funny as ****. The Cowboy was funny too, not really sure why they put him in there, but it fit. Caesar is an accurate depiction of a boss(or really mini boss) in a post-apocalyptic world that only the strong thrive and the unlucky die. The movie was highly enjoyable to me, though I've found weirder films lately have brought me satisfaction. This is a simple tale, that will make you laugh, cry for a companion robot, root for the good guy, and GORE!! LOTS OF GORE!"
" Perfected and accurate look at the cheesy B-movies of the 80's.
",0.5719,0.9882,2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"It's no thought-provoking masterpiece, but it is a gory, blood-filled, action-packed dystopian 80's style movie! With an 80's soundtrack to kick it off, brains splatter and limbs are cut off as a superhero saves the day and goes in search of a better future. The film knows well the style of the B-movies from the 80's and creates itself as a perfect replica of them, while also referencing the films that inspired this intentional cheese fest. I love B-movies from the 80's because they have a special atmosphere to them which I cannot describe, a fun, silly one that doesn't require itself goodness to be good. Overall, if you like B-movies from the 80's, you'll love this! However, if you don't, then I don't think you'll enjoy this. It's for a certain audience, and you should know if you're in it."
" So good I could hope the apocalypse!
",0.7683,0.9736,2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"So good I could hope the apocalypse! This film is a true masterpiece in the homage to low budget 80s action films about the future genre. It kept me engaged through the entire film, made fun the genre it falls into and it legitimately funny. I look forward to the second one and hope for a nationwide release."
" Heart, not gore, makes Turbo Kid a winner
",0.5859,0.9418,2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Plot; In the post apocalyptic future of 1997, a young man adopts the mantle of his comic book hero and takes on a tyrannical warlord.Quirky indie flick out of Canada feels like a winking love letter to the Cannon Films catalog from the 1980s. But under its copious amounts of gore (and I do mean copious) beats a real genuine heart, and in the end that's what drives Turbo Kid past the red line. In particular is the performance of actress Laurence LeBoeuf as the infectiously enthusiastic Apple. If you don't fall in love with her, you may want to check and see if you have a heart."
" So much of a Troma feel...
",0.0,0.9621,2017-04-26 00:00:00,7,"...that I had to check at the end to see if they made it(as a note it turns out they are still in business but didn't make this one). Personally a fan of the B movie classics like Toxie and et al, but to each his own.To the movie... campy but fun. Very low budget and it looks it. Acting over done. Special effects over done 80s vintage. Script is shallow but amusing...well you get the idea.Bottom line if Plan B or the Toxic Avenger bring a smile, if you can't wait for the next Tarantino film or next Sharknado flick then you will likely enjoy this film."
" It left me wanting more, and that's a good thing!
",0.5355,0.9647,2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie that owns what it is. The gore is over the top, there are some clichés, and they have no qualms departing from any sense of reality. That said, each of those come across as benefits rather than burdens.The characters have great chemistry. The acting is solid. The soundtrack is perfect. At the end, you are fulling engrossed in the universe they've created.I really hope this gets some more love, and we see more of Turbo Kid!"
" The Kid let me down / semi spoilery
",0.0,0.8324,2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this movie. The trailer hit all the right notes for me and I was psyched to go see it. Turbo Kid played one weekend in my town and I missed it. Luckily Netflix came along and made it available. I will not say it is a waste of time, just a waste of potential. Here is where spoilers may dwell. I thought it had a decent opening, following this lonely kid as he scavenged a post nuclear apocalyptic landscape. The walkman cuing up the 80's montage song was funny, but like the kid who collected artifacts from a bygone decade that's all this movie really does. It takes from all the BMX movies, the post apocalypse movies. Definitely Zombieland with his list of survival rules. I don't need all that nostalgia without a payoff. Turbo Kid gets some life when Apple shows up. An oddly cheery blonde female who isn't quite right. Leboeuf steals the show with her character. Not much of a show to steal but it's hers. The script was solid when it centered around this young odd couple. Where the writing failed this project was nearly everything that wasn't them. The Aussie/Kiwi Cowboy was very out of place. He seemingly maintained the peace in this ""village"" that was under the thumb of a cycloptic warlord. Zeus, yep his name is Zeus and he is portrayed by Micheal Ironside who is what you would expect. No let down there. The settings are not well established at all. This town/village is never shown or established in a competent manner. I know, I know, B-Movie here. That does not excuse a lack of fundamentals in story telling. Weather it's a comic, a game or a movie. You still need to set the stage for everything to play out in. So it's a hodge podge really. Then there is the splatter. Which really I think is another weak link. The gore for the most part is not exciting or all that grotesque. It's just kind of there. The laser blasts are well done. Turbo Kid eviscerates quite a few baddies and that all looks good. All the cross section, dissections are clunky. Like bad 70's samurai movies. I know, I know B-Movie. But you have to have some consistent effects work to get some thrills. These are not thrilling effects. From the mid point on the film becomes predictable and follows all the tropes of the movies I assume they are paying homage to. When the girl is captured and the Kid comes to the rescue. Later on the Kid and the Cowboy are surrounded and she (Apple) comes to the rescue. So on and so forth. It has feeling and that is it's best quality. I'm not a teen or twenty something so I need a bit more than that even in a B-movie schlock fest. Turbo Kid has the coherence of the Toxic Avenger and that is what broke the spell for me. It worked when I was naive but I have more discerning tastes now. I think this could have been a solid film had they focused mostly on the couple and had the rest of the story and characters run through them. Oh well not a total waste. Set laser to meh."
" A good homage to cheesy 80's movies
",0.4404,0.9695,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"This movie is clearly meant not to be taken seriously. It is a very clear example of an homage to the 80's.Let me start wit the positives of the film. The actions films are bloody terrific (no pun intended). Actually I felt that this movie needed more of that gory action which reminded me a lot of Evil Dead 2 (which is one of my favourite movies). The soundtrack is also really cool and catchy and the movie has the style of an 80's action movie. The movie is over the top in the perfect ways.Unfortunately, this movie is really style over substance. While you laugh at the over-the-top moments of the film, you are also thinking about all the plot-holes in the movie. The biggest problem in the movie is the script, which has boring dialogue and a LOT of plot-holes. Some people also praise the ""original"" concept of the movie which is really a less exciting version of ""Mad Max Fury Road"". Of course you might argue that mad max has a much bigger budget for the action scenes, but Mad Max also has much more interesting characters and dialogue.The performances are mostly okay and it is truly amazing that they were able to achieve such incredible practical effects with the low budget that they had.In the end, this is exactly what you expect from an indie movie about a super kid in the Mad Max wasteland.One other thing I find hilarious: The ""super-glove"" in the film is nothing more than Nintendo's ""Power glove"" but painted in a different color. I found that hilarious (in a good way)."
" An Endearing Adventure w/ Campy Violence, Made with Love
",0.34,0.997,2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Turbo Kid is a fun little post-apocalyptic adventure, heavily evocative of certain landmark films from the 80's, particularly Mad Max; however, the creators do not rely on cheap references, but instead revel in the stylistic nuances of their influences to create something new and, for the most part, novel. Their love for what they are making is tangible throughout, giving the entire experience an earnest sincerity that most films, particularly those with a larger budget, simply don't have.The film is quite bloody and violent, to an extent that could easily alienate viewers who are averse to such things; however, the violence is so incredibly campy and over the top so as to mostly be endearing, or even funny. That said, the film's main characters, The Kid and Apple, are so lovably innocent and optimistic that the overall tone remains lighthearted and fun. Their friendship gives the film a wonderful heart. The villains provide a good counterpoint, though they are fairly one-dimensional. The original music is also absolutely fantastic, matching the tone perfectly.The world itself isn't developed much and occasionally the film's small budget becomes slightly detrimental to the viewer's immersion. The creators are mostly very clever with their budget though; all the characters riding bikes instead of driving cars is just adorable and matches the film's tone perfectly. The costumes and overall visual style are also top notch.The amazing thing is that despite the silliness and low budget, this film still manages to have far more heart than most big budget films. It's a genuinely endearing and fun experience."
" Great Cinematography
",0.6249,0.9835,2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie have great cinematography a lot great shots in this film is so beautifully laid out. I love the pacing of the movie it's so realistic base on the aftermath of living and surviving in a post apocalypse wasteland. Compared to Mad Max, Turbo Kid did it more realistic by the tone. They even had everyone riding on BMX bikes which I think makes more sense having no vehicles in a post apocalypse wasteland. Turbo Kid is a indie film mix with action and sci-fi I also like the dark and light tone in the setting of The Kid (Munro Chambers) scavenging in the post apocalypse wasteland for junk items and then later he meets a weird teenage girl Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) very animated and lively. She's has a mysterious backstory later on in the movie.I recommend you give this movie a chance it's a whole lot different then a lot of Hollywood films. It's colorful,dark and the two lead actors Munro Chambers and Laurence Leboeuf did a fine job portraying they characters. I truly enjoy this movie. 10/10"
" Overrated by some sick freaks. Don't waste your time.
",-0.3331,0.9582,2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie, for some reason, was rated 80%+ on that Rotten something site which fooled me into it. To sum up in few words. It's cheap, boring, predictable, disgusting, idiotic. It's like a Tarantino wannabe just finished a mediocre film school in Canada and then was able to lure the government people who has no experiences in film industry to give him some subsidized money to produce a low budget pointless movie just so that they can promote the location where the film was made. If some point in your life loved watching the Japanese-made Power Rangers or some kind of low budget candy super heroes thingy, this might be the movie for you. But you also have to like some disgusting things like blood and gore too, because this Tarantino wannabe made blood splashed like the waterspout in Yellowstone. Human's organs was cut and throwing around like it was supposed to be funny. Well, yeah, if you are a fan of Happy Tree Friends. The only thing that kept me watching this is the bimbo robot that made me slightly wondered that she might be hot in real life. Sometimes, there are movies you think they are not worth spending money to watch, this one was not even worth your time. I think some people rate this good just because they are nostalgic about the idea of 80's apocalypse, which was executed badly, or they just simply sadistically sick people."
" A Great Action, Adventure and Sci-fi Classic indie film
",0.7506,0.9973,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Turbo Kid is an instant classic in the making. I recommend this movie to anyone that's into 80/90s dark comedy movies, mix with daytime or old school silly cartoons. It start at slow pace in the beginning when the kid (Munro Chambers) Scavenging in a post apocalypse wasteland collecting junk items trades it for water. Later on as the movie progress we get to learn more about his character and the people he meet along the way. The thing I like about Turbo Kid is it's characters. All of the characters The Kid, Apple and Skeletron are easily memorable. Skeletron(Edwin Wright) is a villain like Michael Myers, Jason, and leader face that doesn't utter a word just kills. The thing that separate Skeletron from those other villains is his humor; he so different an original villain of his own because the expression he gives a funny humor vibe killing his victims. Skeletron is a live action cartoon villain with humor base on his expression. Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) is energetic, very lively, animated and active, but her character keeps progressing and you will see a lot of development in this character. She start to tone down her active status throughout the movie. You will start to learn more why she's that way if keep watching.The movie start at slow pace in beginning but delivers in a lot of other areas which I enjoy. The main scenes I enjoy was the fight scenes (the pool party) and (the final battle) a lot of Gore and slicing which I find interestingly weird and creative in a unique way. I'm myself really not into Gore but once you keep watching the movie over and over again you find yourself getting use to it. I Also like that this movie had all the characters traveling on bikes the whole time.I here a lot of people comparing Turbo Kid to a lot of 80s classic and Mad Max. I watch all those films and Turbo Kid is far different. I have to say Turbo Kid is more violent than Mad Max because the Gore. The first Mad Max had more romance than Turbo Kid; Turbo Kid is not a romance movie because Apple and The Kid was just friends; more like a buddy duo not much romance. Turbo Kid is all Sci-fi, action, adventure and a little fantasy. Mad Max 1979 is action mix with romance. It show less adventure and sci-fi than Turbo Kid. Many Mad Max fans don't want to admit that it's less violent. Turbo Kid is way more creative and violent it's like retro mixture of cartoon violent for adults. The only problem Mad Max fans holding a grudge over Turbo Kid because it's more brutal than Mad Max with the Gore two completely different movies. Mad Max 1979 is ashamed to include the romance genre because it's adults and young male audiences it tackled to but theirs way more romance in Mad Max then in Turbo kid. Turbo Kid doesn't really have romance because the friendship was shown more. Max character was to soften for the romance. Turbo Kid wasn't mocking anything from Mad Max or The 80s film. This movie has some originality of it's own. The only thing is the same is both set in post apocalypse wasteland.Back to Turbo Kid I love Apple and the Kid friendship so cartoon and quirky; everything about this movie had some originality and creative. All the characters costumes designing was original and creative. Skeletron iron skull mask, saw blade was so different created for a character. The Kid and Apple first and second wardrobe costume was original and creative as well. The fight scenes shows a different form of originality from high budget action movies Turbo Kid separated itself from high budget movies by showing it's creative side during a fight scene. Like in the final battle we have body on body which was unique thinking about weird stuff happening in cartoons that's the vibe I get from that scene. This movie had a lot of creativity behind it that separates from Mad Max 1979 and 80s classic. I never get why fans call action movies like marvel and dc masterpiece with no creative art in those film. As a artist you can call Turbo Kid and any indie film a masterpiece. It's a lot of different forms of art in this movie sci-fi, Gore artist; Some colorful mix with dark. When Kid blast the giant man (at the pool party) I say that was art with blood and guts. Some of these art you can see in art galleries, museums violent Gore painting. Some may not get a film like this because they never been into art. In the movie I like the bond between Frederic and The Kid its like a father and son relationship that I hope continues. All the characters connects well throughout the movie it shows more when all three characters The Kid, Frederic and Apple work well together fighting off Zeus( Michael Ironside) and his crew. After watching this countless times; this movie earned the title as my new favorite movie. It's been a long time I felt this way because Turbo Kid really is something different that you can enjoy for yourself."
