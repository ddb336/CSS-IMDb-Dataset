" One of the Most Predictable Movies in the History of Film
",0.0,0.7269,2021-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Spoiler Alert - not so muchThis is exactly what you guessed. A boxer is champion. He has personal problems and hits rock bottom. He gets himself together. Resumes training and then gets a title fight. He wins the title fight, and the last image is him hugging his daughter. The fighting cinematography is good though.Yawn."
" The Fighter receives on Oscar but not Southpaw?
",0.0772,0.6705,2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"The best comeback film. Watch it and I'm positive you will come back and give this a 10. If you don't, you are partnered with Rotten üçÖ"
" Counterpuncher
",0.0,-0.9042,2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Middleweight boxer Jake Gyllenhaal is a champion boxer with a glitch: he only turns fierce enough to win after taking a lot of punishment, Loving wife Rachel McAdams worries he is going to end up punchdrunk. Then she is killed and Gyllenhaal hits bottom. He goes broke, his daughter is put into the system and he has to struggle back. He goes to trainer Forest Whitaker, who is tough and honest.In other words, it's a fairly standard boxing movie, informed by Gyllenhaal's typically expert weirdo performance, the all-too-marginal presence of Whitaker, and director Antoine Fuqua's love of brutality. For once, I think Fuqua's predilection is justified, as Gyllenhaal gets beaten up by everything: the boxers, the court system, the loss of his wife, and the anger of Oona Laurence as his daughter.Gyllenhaal's character seems to be based on two real boxers, George Chuvalo Miguel Cotto."
" Southpaw
",0.0,-0.9124,2021-02-06 00:00:00,3,"Boxing movies are a dime a dozen. Some movies such as Somebody Up There Likes Me or Rocky have a heart and soul.Others like Raging Bull have a central character that is heavily flawed but made up by bravado filmmaking and acting performance.Southpaw is just creatively bankrupt. It is really a downbeat nihilist rehash of Rocky 3.Jake Gyllenhaal muscles up as Billy Hope. An orphan turned light heavyweight boxing champion. He has money, cars and a luxury house.His devoted wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) wants him to turn his back on boxing now he is nearing the end of his career. Spend more time with her and his young daughter Leila.Billy's manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent) wants him to take on a few more easy fights as a good payday.Lurking menacingly is brash contender Miguel 'Magic' Escobar who is trying to entice Billy to a fight with some bad behaviour. Just as Clubber Lang did with Rocky.In a public fracas with Escobar, Maureen ends up being shot dead with no one convicted. Billy's life descends in a haze of drugs, booze and violence. He loses custody of his daughter and his wealth.The only solace is to start again at rock bottom. He wants to join up with trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) but he does not take on professionals. Tick also knows that Billy needs to learn new life lessons. His behaviour by engaging in a brawl with Escobar that led to Maureen's death when Billy should had simply walked away.Simply put, Billy makes one stupid decision after another. Even at the court hearing dealing with his daughter's custody. He cannot stop swearing in front of the judge.Like a mediocre boxer's jab. Southpaw is a blandly predictable movie with everything telegraphed in advance."
" Rubbish....
",0.0,-0.296,2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Imdb 7.4 are you kidding, this film is crap.
Why review is too short, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish...."
" Formulaic, but executed well.
",0.3919,0.9682,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"The storyline of the movie follows an expected formula but doesn't overdo it. The protagonist never acts in a way that wouldn't fit into the previous development. The four things that make this movie good for me are, Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, the cinematography and ""The Notorious B.I.G - Notorious Thugs"" (eventhough it is the censored version). Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker deliver great performances that give a sense of realness. The fights add to this realness, punches connect and the power of the blows is felt. The cinematography is good overall. Especially during he fights there is a great mixture between realistic camera angles; like you'd see in a real match, and creative POV shots or other creative angles.Overall a decently good movie that I recommend watching!"
" Southpaw
",0.0,0.9953,2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Southpaw, directed & produced by Antoine Fuqua, was thrilling and emotional, but couldn't help but being another clich√© and predictable boxing tale. The one massive plus I give to Antoine Fuqua, is that he didn't make a regular boxing film with a choppy narrative, and sloppy script - He balanced out the boxing, and the narrative well enough, to keep the narrative afloat, with some decent pieces of dialogue.Jake Gyllenhaal went from Prisoner, to Nightcrawler, to now Southpaw, and he transformed into each role very professionally! Gyllenhaal puts on such a great performance, as a down & out boxer, portraying his emotional scenes at such a deep, sentimental level. In almost every boxing film, usually the main antagonist is who our protagonist is fighting, but here, Jake Gyllenhaal is his own antagonist. I thought that was very creative, and brought out some deep character development in his character. Our other antagonist is Miguel Gomez. He was nothing but a plot device, and a pretty weak one at that, other than his sly remarks. Oona Laurence, at such a young age, put on a very good performance as Laila Hope. She really makes you feel for her character, while Gyllenhaal & Laurence' chemistry is nearly flawless, for their first production together. Rachel McAdams also puts on a great performance, while her character having the most impact on the film, with probably the least amount of screen time. I'm a big time fan of Forest Whitaker, and it was awesome to see him in this film. Forest Whitaker portrays a boxing coach so well, I was thinking about signing up for Will Tik's gym myself. For all the artists that think they can act now, like T.I. & Vanilla Ice, 50 cent is one of the best artist out there, in film. He does a decent job in this film, with his character having a decent twist.The screenplay by Kurt Sutter, being Sutter's only film, was pretty good; Kurt Sutter gave this film a personality. He created a lot of great emotional dialogue, that helped you bond, and feel for the characters.The score by the iconic James Horner added this deep, sorrowful score, that enhanced the feeling during the emotional, and break down scenes. The music soundtrack by Marshall Mathers (Eminem) was awesome!Overall, this film is a decent time, but doesn't really set itself apart from the other boxing films."
" Wicked
",-0.5267,0.9601,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Jake Gyllenhaals performance is amazing and so was Rachel McAdams for the part she was in it - although a vital plot for the movie it was a shame her character died because she complimented Gyllenhaals character so well. I enjoyed how there was no other love interest other than his drive to get his daughter back, made the movie much more intense. I feel like it would have been cool if the daughter came out to the ring at the end that's the only flaw I see in the ending however it drew more focus to Gyllenhaal speaking to his wife in the corner. Very emotional. Hard to flaw."

",-0.5562,-0.8495,2020-10-12 00:00:00,5,"The story of a boxer who loose his wife and career after an incident. He also loosing custody of his daughter and house too. This part is takes too long portion of the movie, so movie getting boring at a point. Only last part is watchable. This movie does not worth for 7 and above stars. Jake Gyllenhaal did not impress so much as he ought to be with his one eye presence most of time. Forest Whitaker is again in a role of boxing coach. He and Billy's daughter did well job for acting department. Last sequence of awaited boxing match is made long for result even after the match was over. Overall it seems an average movie with long part of depressed life of a boxer and finally predictable end."
" Split Points!
",0.0,0.9948,2020-09-26 00:00:00,6,"Antoine Fuqua's Southpaw is really well made, has a great cast, rugged in - the - ring action, but a storyline that is too formulaic for its own good.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a compellingly real performance as Billy ""The Great"" Hope, who begins the movie as the undisputed light-heavyweight boxing champion of the world, before his personal world, slides out from underneath him. Good as he undoubtedly is, Gyllenhaal still can't stop himself channelling Sylvester Stallone's Rocky persona, especially in the way he moves and delivers much of his dialogue in mumbles. During one particularly emotional moment, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear a wailed A-d-r-i-a-n shouted skywards, except here Hope's wife is Maureen, played by a strong Rachel McAdams, in what really could never be honestly described as a lead role.The Rocky parallels continue further with Forest Whitaker playing a larger, black version of Mickey, Rocky's trainer. Where Southpaw does differ from the earlier franchise is that the narrative is almost relentlessly downbeat, remembering that this is 2+ hour film. Things do get pretty bleak for a large portion of the movie, though the underlying theme of the movie is one man's personal redemption (as if that hasn't been done before too ... and in boxing films).Southpaw's derivative conventions preclude it from achieving any real pretence to greatness, though undoubtedly many fans of the genre will happily go the distance, barracking supportively for The Great Hope."

üìú Plot: A champion boxer fights to get his daughter back from child protective services as well as revive his professional career, after a fatal incident sends him on a rampant path of destruction.

.

üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Review : Southpaw is Cinematic Masterpiece which involves a heartwarming, moving and inspiring tale of Boxer Billy Hope played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The Plot and Premise is nothing phenominal but the fact that how realistic you can make a movie matters. The movie oscillates events from the life of Billy which were tragic, hurting and heartbreaking and how he fights all odds to win the world and her daughter over. This Antoine Fuqua Sports Drama is completely engrossing and leaves no stones unturned when it comes to screenplay, extraction of brilliant performances and immervsive BGM which elevates the experience.Jake Gyllenhaal is a revelation in this one, unlike any other roles he has done in the past he is lean and seems to fit into the physique quite extra-ordinarily. His performances is magical. With a bunch of brilliant actors like Forest Whitaker and Rachel McAdams there is no complaints on anyone's work behind the camera.Overall , One of the finest Sports Drama i have watched yet. A definite watch if you like engrossing sports like Boxing and how a simple sport matters everything and cas cost you everything in real life.

" Highly unoriginal but rescued by some phenomenal acting
",0.6243,-0.7564,2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"There are so many flaws and cliches in this movie that with a weak cast it really could be unwatchable. However, the lead performance from Jake Gyllenhaal and his on-screen daughter Oona Laurence are so mesmeric that it elevates a poor script into something extremely captivating and memorable.I have no idea why there wasn't any attempt whatsoever at originality as it really is a waste of such a brilliant cast. The Rocky formula seems to be virtually inescapable and I don't really understand why- it never felt particularly authentic in the first place."
" Amazing movie
",0.5859,0.9002,2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"The first 45-60 minutes of the movie is very tough to watch through, i mean he is broken down to his very basics, if even that, i mean it was like a combination of Titanic and Rocky in the best way possible. Would recommend to everybody who loves satisfying ends."

" Simple idea executed to perfection
",0.5719,0.6908,2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"While the idea of southpaw is nothing new, the side stories happening outside the ring is very refreshing. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely phenomenal. His character, Billy Hope, has so much character development despite its short runtime of just under two hours. This ripped emotions out of me, this being one of only two movies to have ever made me cry. On top of all of that the soundtrack is great with multiple songs by Eminem."

",0.0,0.9392,2020-03-31 00:00:00,5,"I can't really say the movie was all bad.. but neither all good.. Basically it is another boxing movie.. A Boxer at the top of his career looses everything like a bolt from the blue so he can win most of it back after few weeks of training.. I found the plot really boring, the main characters were not described sufficiently.. Billy overshadows them all.. and Jake Gyllenhaal plays his role really well and you get to see a lot about how he's ripped if that catches your attention... I would however recommend the movie Cinderella man better.."
" MASTERPIECE
",0.6249,0.9898,2020-03-11 00:00:00,10,"The best boxing movies are the ones where the real fight is outside of the ring. It invests us so much in all the characters so when ultimately the protagonist steps in the ring, we care so much we find ourselves bobbing ourselves fearing he doesnt get hit.THIS and ROCKY are the two boxing movies that had stories where it made me care like so much was weighing inside the rings and that can ONLY be done by executing a brilliant story and narrative and then ultimately let the viewers feel like they finished watching this like a champion view in life. This movie provides me with that and I fell in love with Billy and his daughter who embodies her mother at the end.""Your mother would be so proud of you.""THAT got me and how about his daughter, incredible actor and so cute emulating McAdams looks Wise and Jake. So proud of this movie and feel it's a great injustice has been done because of the low ratings and prolonging or people maybe never even finding this in their life"
" UNDERRATED!!!
",0.0,-0.6062,2020-03-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie should be in the same conversation as Raging Bull. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in this film made me a fan of him, it was incredible. I just can't believe how this film didn't win any awards and Jake definitely deserved at least a nomination."
" Forest Whitaker and Jake Gyllenhaal were fantastic
",0.5574,-0.4577,2020-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Getting a 10 year old girl to be that expressive and emotional is hard. Oona Laurence was part of the glue that kept the movie together. When she wrapped her legs around her dad at the end, I cried. The fight scenes were not fantastic, but ok. In my opinion, it was the interplay between Forest Whitaker and Jake Gyllenhaal that skyrocketed. I do think that they should have added one line, in the gym, the night that Hope heard that Hoppy died, and Tick swore three or four times, Hope should have said, ""Give me 50 for swearing."""
" Great
",0.6249,0.948,2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,"The first 45 minutes are basically Murphy's law for the protagonist: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. But you it's also true that when you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up. What follows still isn't predictable here, but takes a lot of effort, sweat and tears. Once the film is over, you realize it played you with the conventions of the sports drama you've seen a few times before. But while you're in it, you're on the edge of the seat and feel for this deeply flawed man and his adorable daughter. That's no small feat. Director Fuqua could rely on an incredibly strong cast, especially Gyllenhaal, delivering one of the best performances of his career."
" Southpaw
",0.0,-0.4697,2020-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The boxers had always confronted many hardships in their life, whether its family or fame. At one point a boxer is flying in the skies: full of arrogance, catching the words of support from millions of people. But just one little mistake, one little out behavior in their careers deteriorate their life for ever and they become the piece of trash until their death. Movies like Southpaw, The Fighter, Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, Raging Bull, and Rocky are brilliant on the subject."

The first half is so bad that it is very hard to reach the second half, and the second half is actually good and it is worth to endure the first half.The script is absolute s*hit and character development is just does not exist. But fast forward the first 50 minutes and it is ok."
" Would've been rated higher
",0.0,-0.8218,2019-03-20 00:00:00,7,This movie is great in almost all aspects. The biggest problem is the child actor. Every scene she is in I get taken right out of the movie. And this is especially unfortunate because most of her scenes are with Jake Gyllenhaal who is giving a great performance of a father who is desperately trying to reconnect with his daughter. The worst case however is during the last big fight when they keep cutting away to show the child actors reaction. Which completely ruined it for me.
" A man of good faith.
",0.6908,0.9971,2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Every person is capable of good intentions. And within intentions lies the phenomenon one might term "" good faith"". That is, can a person make the utmost of the moral understanding at their disposal to translate their good intentions to the material and practical world in a profound and honorable way? If you can, you have ""good faith"", regardless of how far that falls short of objective justice. One example of good faith would be a slave master, in a world where all they know is slave-keeping, from their parents, religious leaders, and culture, but yet they find their way to treating their slaves with great compassion and respect, and eventually even to setting them free. Is this enough to satisfy objective justice? No. Should we demand from them that they do far more? Yes. For example, the slave master should obviously fight against slavery in general, not just let his own slaves go free. But what we can do with such a person is respect their good faith. That is to say, we can appreciate their good intentions that they have translated to the world around them, and we can sympathize and identify with that part of them. Because after all, none of us are immune to grave moral error. We must salute the flag of good faith in all people, regardless of their moral condition in other respects. Southpaw is a movie about just such a person. He comes from a world of extreme violence and survival. But in the end no one can deny how hard this man tries, to do justice to his wife and daughter and himself. And that quality we should salute in him, a quality that raises him in stature above other human beings who have the benefit of far better moral understanding, but who have made less of what they were given. This movie benefits from an extraordinary performance by Forest Whittaker, and some excellent moments from Jake Gyllenhaal and Oona Laurence."

" This isn't just a boxing movie but a movie about redemption
",0.0,0.9863,2019-02-12 00:00:00,9,"First of all, I love the underlining themes of this film. Yes, this film is a boxing film but it's one of those films where you have to watch it to get the deeper meaning behind it. One of the meanings is that you have to lose once in a while to get better. Billy has to change from when we first see him at the beginning of the film to the last time. Which is another reason why I love this film is the character development in this film. Billy doesn't stay the same from beginning to end. No, he has to change in order to get his life back together and you see that not just instantly but over the period of the film. I also really liked the pacing in this film. None of the scenes felt rushed or slowed down at any point. They all felt like the speed it should be going at for a movie like this. But I can't say the same about the transitions in this film. Some of them were awkward and took away from the emotion in that scene. The acting in this film was spectacular as well. Which ties in well with the emotion because all the actors and actresses easily showed the proper emotion that was supposed to be seen at that moment. When a character was upset or angry you could easily see it in their facial expression and body language. But obviously I knew Jake Gyllenhaal was going to be good in this film but somebody who shocked me was Oona Laurence, who plays Leila Hope. She acted way beyond somebody her age and she could easily steal the scene from any of the adults and I hope she has a great career in the future. In the end, this film isn't just a boxing film but a movie about how you have to lose once in a while to change and grow as a person."
" Actors credit due
",0.3818,0.8705,2019-02-03 00:00:00,8,"The movie plot is same old. However, Jake Gyllenhaal's acting, frustration (situation based) is so real. I love the dialogue delivery, body language and body transformation that he has gone through. McAdams, although for a short role delivered powerful performance.
Cliched slow Mo moments (right after a boxer would throw a punch) is something i didn't want to see.All in all, good movie. Worth watching. Highly recommended."
" There Is Always Hope
",0.4404,0.9528,2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,"'Southpaw', although it doesn't bring anything new on the table in the boxing movie genre, is still one of the best boxing film outside the 'Rocky' saga and beside 'Raging Bull'. Jake Gyllenhaal is pure force majeure in this one and he is supported by Forest Whitaker's dedicated performance. Oona Laurence was wonderful as Billy Hope's daughter Leila. Although Rachel McAdams's screen time was quite brief (considering 2 hour running time) she still managed to leave impact. And all these dedicated performances turned 'Southpaw' very vivid emotional roller coaster ride. But don't think that without these great acting jobs this movie would have been just another cliche ridden bore. Although Jake Gyllenhaal's Billy Hope was most memorable part, Kurt Sutter's screenplay packs enough punch, and the author really knew (perhaps not on Stallone level with his Rocky movies) how to use these cliches the way they work.Pretty straightforward and simple story, but Antoine Fuqua's directing style and superb acting make 'Southpaw' must see for every boxing movie fan, and like 'Rocky' movies, this one also holds re-watching value, even though the training montages aren't nearly as cool."

" Gyllenhaal is Wonderful, the Script not so much...
",0.5719,0.4283,2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"I really can't say enough about Gyllenhaal in this film. His Billy is possibly his career performance and he gives a deeply committed layered performance. Gyllenhaal is raw, emotional, and trans-formative. The film is very much worth seeing just to see him. Billy manages to feel like the archetypal boxer while coming off as a three dimensional person in the process. Gyllenhaal also manages to do the boxer mumble while be understandable. I just loved Gyllenhaal in this.Sadly, much of the rest of the film doesn't stand up nearly as well. The script is good but highly predictable. (I was able to say lines before they happened). The story is overcooked and goes too dark in places. Hops' fate was hugely overwrought. Too much of the time this story feels depressing for the sake of depression. It is engaging but a shadow of what could have been.The fights are good but not as engaging as lot of other boxing movies. There was too much subjective POV camera work in the fights and the editing rhythm doesn't seem to build right.This is a good film but it is no Creed."

Whitaker, McAdams and young Oona all terrific. At the top with it all, for an incident, accident or illness to change everything. Many things had to fall in place for Billy to get back and the slightest shift could of altered things drastically, but nothing unrealistic.

Other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are well done, but not exceptional. These elements aren't easy to achieve. It's hard to make a good movie, because ALL of the aspects of the film have to come together.In this case, the plot was formulaic and not a single dumb melodramatic trope was left out. (Oh, I guess no one got cancer, so they mercilessly left out one manipulative trope).This plot is just a pathetic, unoriginal manipulation of the audience. As a lover of good movies, I expect more."
" a great comeback story
",0.6249,0.8262,2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that the human spirit will help you keep going but also being taken down a peg so you are forced to be humble in order to get a head. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Emotional rollercoaster

Even though Southpaw never quite reaches the Oscar-winning caliber of other boxing films, it still manages to stand on its own as a perfectly decent sports drama. Well directed and demonstrating (for those still in doubt) Jake Gyllenhaal's impressive acting range, the combination of brutality and emotion help outweigh an otherwise predictable plot."

He can only be restored to strength by strong black males who have far superior survival skills and values. Gyllenhaal is such a great actor but even he cannot act out becoming a black man. Nothing rings true. Fuqua, like many far-left zealots, revel in the decline in white males and want them to be as pictured here. Many have become this stereo-type, which is why it exists, and while so many white males actually enjoyed this, and gave it a high rating. The negative reviews were a more precise description and obviously came from those still opposing this crest. They refuse to wear it and extol its virtues despite the reality it represents."

" New Favourite Boxing Movie
",0.0,-0.9846,2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Lets be honest, there are a number of boxing movies preceeding this one. The entire Rocky series for instance. Because of that, I see that alot of the reviews are touting that this movie feels formulaic. I would agree insofar as there are some cool montage scenes meant to get the viewer fired up. However, the difference here is that the music is much more modern as opposed to 'Eye of the Tiger'. Outside of that, I was thoroughly impressed by the directing and action scenes.Speaking about the movie as a whole, I was completely floored. McAdams' death was so traumatic that I literally had to stop watching for a few minutes. It is impossible not to feel heartbroken at the grief and anguish Gyllenhaal carries afterwards. As his life is turned upside down, the viewer is left to contemplate how they themselves would cope with the emotional turmoil of having their loved ones violently taken from them. His subsequent self destruction is a fear at the core of every human that has suffered the loss of a bond as strong as love.Whether you're a boxing fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. Its message reminds us all that no matter what happens, we need to keep fighting for ourselves and our loved ones. For me, Billy Hope has become a new icon of perseverance. Don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling at the TV or physically reacting to certain scenes.That all having been said. the reason that this movie gets an 8 and not higher is very simple.. McAdams' death was unnecessary. Dont get me wrong, the whole movie is centrifugal around this particular plot development. However, if you review the movie chronologically, you will see that Escobar wanted to fight Hope and the feeling was mutual prior to the ensuing tragedy. 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) turns down the fight which eventually leads to an altercation wherein Escobar is taunting Hope. All of this makes sense, however the part where Billy's wife gets shot in the altercation does not. Was it intentional? Was it an accident? Was 50 cent in on it? We never even really find out what happens to the shooter. As twisted as it sounds, the movie would be even more compelling if the death was targeted. Given the impact it has on the movie, more details surrounding the reason and aftermath of McAdams' death would have provided more closure."
" Same old
",0.0,0.6622,2018-03-06 00:00:00,4,"SOUTHPAW is another same old-same old boxing drama about a boxing champion going through personal tragedy, losing it all, and then having to train to get back to the top again. You've seen this kind of gritty tale play out loads of times before in the likes of RAGING BULL and the ROCKY franchise, and I found this was a rather inferior version of the story: full of cliches and bad language, but with little wit or heart. A near-unrecognisable Jake Gyllenhaal plays the unsympathetic lead and doesn't really do much with it, although he's in good physical shape. Rachel McAdams is my favourite part of the film and appears in a crucial role early on. Forest Whitaker shows up late on as a trainer but only gets to go through the motions which is a pity. The running time is overlong and the character drama is a bit overwrought, with a lot of flaws throughout preventing it from really zinging; the actress playing Gyllenhaal's daughter is another misstep as she's totally cold. Antoine Fuqua has directed other films very well but he's merely middling here and the boxing scenes lack dynamism."
" Very Entertaining Throughout

It did decent at the box office and receive mixed to good reviews. The film is highly engaging and entertaining throughout and the main reason is the acting and performance of Gylleenhall, as we can see the emotions and pain he committed for this film. Although somewhat generic and filled with cliches in which we have seen in previous sports dramas, Southpaw still delivers on what it was meant to, as in an interesting and fully rich story. With these type of films, the criticism may be because they are predictable, and although true, the joy is watching the story unfold and see the performances. In short, Southpaw is a rare boxing film with heart, emotion and one which keeps entertained throughout."

BEGIN!Round 1: Main character name. The champ comes out swinging with the titular title character ""Rocky"" invoking a time, place and ethnicity. The laughably bland main character name in ""South"" - Billy ""The Great"" Hope - sounds the writers were trying to come up with some intriguing name but eventually principal filming needed to start and they couldn't answer the question ""The Great"" what? Did they mean he is the Great Hope? But not the Great White Hope with it implicit kinda racist overtones? Anyway, few real boxer nicknames and no movie boxer nicknames can stand again the memorability of the ""Italian Stallion"". And the challenger is down and the fight end early!Round 2: the kid: The challenger avoids the early knockout with Oona (that's a name?) Laurence's portrayal of Billy the Goat...er Great's daughter who is traumatized by the shooting death of her mother and Billy's incompetent parenting. While Laurence winds up just shouting at the televised climatic fight much like Ian Fried's Rocky, Jr. does, at least she has a character arc and some dramatic moment. Looks like the fight is on.Round 3: the death that pushes the champion into a downward spiral: and we got ourselves a battle! We had 2 fully ""Rocky"" movies to come to know Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill so his heart attack before the first Clubber Lang fight is affecting. However, given how much Billy and Leila rely on Maureen to parent them both, her shooting by Miguel Escobar's squad equals the pathos of Mickey's death.Round 4: the baddie: Oh, and the champion comes back hard! The monster of 80's cheese Mr. T. somehow projects both a menacing and ludicrous screen presence. He plays the hungry, scrappy underdog that Rocky was before his Ferrari and house robot made him soft. Miguel ""Magic"" Escobar amounts to little more than off-the-shelf disrespectful thug with little to distinguish him from his crew.Round 5: the savior trainer: But the challenger isn't done yet! The excellent Forest Whitaker plays the also unfortunately named Tick Willis (seriously, who came up with these character names?) He is kind to street kids and who takes on Billy when he is at his lowest point despite Billy treating him like crap and he is some kind of boxing training savant (his expertise is never explained). While the round goes to ""Southpaw"", Carl Weathers Apollo Creed (see, that's a great character name) is a mostly one note Rocky support system for Rocky but his physical attractiveness and easy smile makes his a highly engaging actor to watch on film.Round 6: the big fight: And the challenger is against the ropes! The eventual Escobar Vs. Hope or ""Magic"" Vs. ""The Great"" battle excels at verisimilitude and therefore not so much at drama. An open Hollywood secret director Antoine Fuqua missed in film school is that while audiences complain about the lack of realism in movie boxing matches, they actually want them to include dozens of uncontested punches per round. Balboa Vs. Lang includes enough haymakers to give both men CTE before the ring girl strutted around the ring with the ""4"" card. When Jim Lampley's monolouging during the climatic Miguel / Hope showdown is the most interesting part of the proceedings, your fight staging is a little too accurate.And the challenger is out! There won't be no rematch or a ""Southpaw"" sequel for that matter. The plodding, overly serious, staging of a story that's been done better multiple times before unfortunately wastes Gyllenhaal's impressive physical transformation. In short, ""Rocky!"", ""Rocky!"", Rocky!"""

Billy Hope is an immature and brash man with a wife, son and a strong left hook. He's rolling in dough, material possessions and fame. Suddenly, a surprising tragedy strikes and his life as he knows it is altered forever. The tragedy caught me off guard as if I was the one taking one to the jaw. Will Billy be able to claw his was back to his level of fame or will he be KO'd (couldn't resist) by the weight of the tragedy? Will he learn to be humble to learn what matters most in life? The story is told with strong emotions and dramatic scenes. The rise is rather predictable but felt fresh. Strong acting and quality cinematography help make this above average for the boxing genre."

I think Jake Gyllenal is better than this.

Yes the storyline may have been done a few times before, but there's a reason for that and its simple, it makes for a good story and it works, and Southpaw does it very well. Jake Gyllenhaal is nothing short of a revelation as Billy Hope who goes through every human emotion possible as his ideal life is shattered and he has to pick up the pieces. Although her role was very brief Rachel McAdams likewise turned in a brilliant performance as Maureen and as is Oona Laurence as daughter Leila whose world is turned upside down by event not of her own making. Forrest Whittaker as trainer father figure and mentor Tick Wills was superb, and 50 Cents as your stereotypical boxing promoter did the job solidly enough. Miguel Gomez as the antagonist likewise turns in a surprisingly good performance as someone who wants what the protagonist has. The boxing scenes were really well done and were authentic thanks to the use of the HBO announcers and Jimmy Lennon Jr. To summarise Southpaw does have a plot which has been done before but it does it very well and thanks to the acting, the movie is worth watching and owning."

I do not like boxing movies, but in this case, as it is not a normal boxing film, it does not focus on boxing, it looks better.The best of the film, by far, is Jake Gyllenhaal, plays a very good role, it's a shame that the film does not accompany him.Why do not you go with him? It is long, too, it does not get to capture you, at times it seems more a television movie than a great movie, is not well shot and that is not bad at all, especially the boxing scenes you at least see what happens.There are times when you try to get excited, but you do not get it, I explain it in the spoiler zone.The Cinematography is not bad, but it is not very good either.

" Redemption doesn't need to be so over the top and rushed to attain
",0.2648,0.9986,2017-06-14 00:00:00,5,"I pretty much decided to watch this because I figured it would be a formulaic yet entertaining little respite which wouldn't require much in the way of deep thinking on my part... something I could just sort of zone out and put the old noggin on auto- pilot and maybe shop for stuff on amazon or update my Instagram or check my email on the side too, you know? Basically I'm just saying that I wasn't at all expecting something groundbreaking and transformative here, okay? And Jake Gyllenhall is a solid actor no doubt. The actress who plays his wife is good, too. Rachel McAdams right? I get her confused with Elizabeth Banks all the time. They're both good... whatever, that's not the point here obviously. Anyway, the movie starts out more or less how I would think. We have a boxer dude, Billy Hope, who is a hard-nosed, street wise family man with all the heart you would expect, but of course with the clich√© below-average intelligence to go with it. He's a veteran, undefeated 43-0 light heavyweight champ who has a gorgeous wife who loves him deeply and genuinely, and a daughter around 10 or 11 who waits patiently in her bed at home for her mommy and daddy to come back after the fight which he wins, and is still able to tuck her in and give her a goodnight kiss as she counts the bruises on his face so lovingly. He then caps the night off with some well- deserved nookie from his beautiful lady... a seemingly perfect life. Obviously we know things are gonna go downhill. But how his perfect life just falls apart after our expositional introduction is so dismissive of any realistic premise whatsoever, it is miles and miles beyond the standard suspension of disbelief that should be expected from any type of moderately intelligent audience whatsoever. The writing of this movie at this point, and for the rest of it is essentially just throwing any and all credibility it may have established out the window just so that it can hit you over the head with the notion of redemption at the end. Billy loses his gorgeous best friend wife to a stray bullet after an altercation at charity event with a fighter-in-waiting who's been whining on the sideline for his shot at the champ. One of this antagonist's crew pulls out a gun in the middle of a fight between the two boxers in a room full of witnesses as if this was a teen gang violence movie or something. Basically it's a ludicrous way for Gyllenhall to lose his wife and begin his necessary breakdown in order to come back at the end. But this murder pretty much gets brushed aside, and NOBODY seems to do a damn thing in finding out who actually pulled the gun...including Gyllenhall. Then everyone seems to expect the dude to keep on business as usual with apparently no time allotted to grieve or be given a break. Oh and also even though he's the champ and undefeated, he's also of course somehow on the verge of bankruptcy right after losing his wife as well. And his manager.. played so laughably bad by 50 Cent.. is seen right after he loses his wife sitting ringside at the next fight with the same fighter who's crew murdered his wife. I mean... really? I'm not even going to bother going through the rest of all the ridiculous plot points.. how he loses custody of his daughter becomes the crux of what he needs to fight for... and that's when the story actually starts to become engaging and emotive. But the way we arrive there is so sensationalist, almost Kafka-esque in an unintended fashion due to the authority the state plays in removing his custody. If his fall had been more his own fault, perhaps he would have lost some standing in the viewer rooting for him but it would have been something that real people could identify with even more. It would have benefited with more real mistakes made on his end and simply not just being reckless in his grieving with seemingly no help from any friends even though he clearly has a crew of good guys he was surrounding himself with in the beginning. It just makes the journey he goes through ring hallow, and all it would have taken was more earnest care in actually developing a believable arch instead of just rushing to the redemption. In fact, if the writer was so eager to get to the comeback, the rising from ashes of tragedy.. if he really just wanted to rush the audience to seeing Billy Hope restore his own hope and all that stuff etc etc... I think we shouldn't have ever actually seen any of his perfect life exposition at all. It should have just been gradually discovered through reference in the dialogue. That would have been more effective and sold the premise a lot better in the end. Gyllenhall makes the movie work enough because he's a great actor, but there were a lot of missed opportunities in the script because the writer was too eager to make the story about the breakdown and building back of a champ who loses his compass in the form of wife. This movie would have been a lot more interesting if the first scene was Gyllenhall showing up at Wills gym, the first scene that Forest Whitaker is introduced in. If that's the opening scene, then we as the audience wouldn't know who Billy Hope is yet, we would just know he's a big deal to the other kids training at the gym in how they talk about him. That would have delivered a lot more intrigue to the story. The whole exposition sells this movie short and makes it almost laughable at points. Opportunities missed."
" Southpaw Movie Makes You Cry
",-0.4767,0.9992,2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Boxing drama Southpaw (2015) hit silver screen in Australia last night.Regardless how tough you may be, during over two hours of Southpaw movie, emotions and bugs are all over you and basically ripping you apart. Toughness has nothing to do with the muscles when it comes to living your life aspects.The plot of the picture is very simple, it is all about ordinary life. Involvement of boxing simply generates that comparison, clearly demonstrating that very thin line between toughness and weakness.Hope Dies LastOne of the taglines of Southpaw movie is ""Never Give Up Hope"". It obviously reflects on the last name of the main character Billy Hope. However there is much more deeper meaning behind it.The definition of both ""life"" and ""live"" is obviously about people. It is also always about other people, those important for you. So basically when you lose a person from your life, but this person is still in ""life"", there is always hope to get this person back in your life, if you know what I mean.The hope dies together with that person. Simply saying when that person is gone, there is no more hope to get anything back in (to) ""life"". This is when the responsibility on the third person comes into action. It is very important to take that responsibility. The responsibility that drives you and not letting to give up.You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamedThe drama in Southpaw starts when Hope looses his better half. It develops into a more difficult situation when the system is taking his daughter away from him. The one, he is responsible on. The way that renowned system works we all know quite well. This is also and always a human factor which this system is made of ‚Äì made by different people.I believe, the responsibility on others is the only thing which keeps all of us going. Prove me wrong when you find a happy person who has all of the ""materialistic features"", but nobody to bring him a glass of water, and not because they are paid for doing it, but because they care and responsible on this person.Hurt, But Never DefeatedSouthpaw movie demonstrates the power of the will. It clearly shows that there is always a certain way to come out victorious. This way ‚Äì is to do what you've been always doing the best. In the movie it is boxing, which is easy to put as an example, with the ""winning inside the ring"" feeling of being a champion. But in fact ‚Äì it can be anything. This is where the new plan is not applicable.Plans Never WorkOne of the scenes in Southpaw is when they are talking about the next step. Hope mentions that it has never been him drawing those plans. It has been always his wife, who is now gone. Being lost, but responsible he, though, finds the way. The way I've just mentioned above ‚Äì he does what he does best.One man, no manThere is an old Russian saying which is translated in English as ""There is safety in numbers"", or maybe a closer definition will be ""One man, no man"". Basically it means that we all need help. This is where Hope finds that needed person, the trainer, who helps him dot the i's and cross the t's. This how it is always in life ‚Äì you meet people with the same spirit as you, combining together a Win Team.Love, Hope, BelieveEverything done because of love ‚Äì is always beautiful. Simply because love is the most beautiful feeling. About hope I have just written above. So finally, when it comes to believe in love, never giving up on hope featuring doing what you do best ‚Äì this is that required plan.Keep living your life, cause it's your timeIf the hope faded away with that person, which is obviously not under your control, ‚Äì you have to let it go. You must success because you are responsible on those who need you.If there is hope ‚Äì you must prove wrong¬Ö if you really believe that you are ""The King"".History Repeats. AlwaysI believe any top athlete, celebrity, ""the king""¬Ö basically any of us can apply this Southpaw movie life story on ourselves. It is known that higher you get, worse it hurts when you fall. You like it or not, the falling aspect is always on the books. Life is a very balanced thing.Injured, Hurt, with a horrific Loss¬Ö but still the champThe Southpaw movie itself is the top Hollywood production. It has all necessary features and characters to demonstrate the reality of life and everything involved. Em was right, saying ""everybody smashed it."" I, believe, am right, saying you must watch it.After the movie, we've kind of laughed on the way back home, that us fighters who get kicked and elbowed on the daily basis, have almost dropped into tears, while watching the picture. This is how emotional and true story the Southpaw movie is. It does touch your heart and makes you think."
" Hard to like a movie with such an obnoxious main character
",-0.2263,-0.0225,2017-05-24 00:00:00,5,"I like boxing movies. I'm almost a sucker for them. Cinderella Man, Rocky 3, Creed, and on and on. I do like the hardworking underdog/redemption story theme, and a well-choreographed match.And these fight sequences are okay, plus Gyllenhaal clearly got in shape for them.BUT he SO overacts, and the character is SO obnoxious, that it just isn't that fun to watch.Whether scripted or not, you feel like Gyllenhaal is ad-libbing a constant patter of nonsense babble in many scenes. We're supposed to care a lot that he loses his great wife, and his daughter is taken away from him. But BOTH happen because HE DOES NOT LISTEN, and he never really confronts that killing flaw.Even in the courtroom scene, when the judge is informing him what's going to happen, Gyllenhaal (I can't feel it's the character) is mugging and clowning and yapping at his daughter across the room, clearly not taking the trial or the judge seriously -- and so, predictably, when the sentence is finished, he says ""What?"" Yeah, Enstein: what she said while you were acting like a dimwitted toddler.What arc there is feels jerky and lacks credibility. He's an idiot, he's an idiot, he's an idiot...oh, okay, now he's really going to train for this fight. Well, great, so I guess everything's all fixed now. And if he can beat that other fighter, he'll be a fit father. Great.It left me more irritated than entertained, and not in any good way.I gave it a 5 because the fight sequences are decent, and the little girl who plays the daughter (Oona Laurence) is one of the more consistent, empathy-provoking characters."
" Full of fight movie clich√©s
",-0.3818,-0.2161,2017-04-28 00:00:00,4,"I couldn't even bare to watch a full hour of the movie that is riddled with clich√©s that are so typical with fight movies. A street kid, orphan or someone else who had a rough childhood rises up to be a champion or a star or something else, only to gain millions of dollars, having everyone leech his money and end up losing it all. I mean how is it possible with every movie? I already lost hope when this movie started to repeat Rocky: A fight ends with a win. A contender opens his mouth immediately. It just seemed so stupid to come out of a winning fight only to have people pushing you to take the next one immediately. It's so stupid.When 50 cent came up on the screen and opened his mouth I lost all hope. That man is a bad actor. Period. Just horrible.It was just unbearable to watch because it repeats the same stuff that every other movie does."
" This movie is about a famous boxer trying to better himself in order to get his daughter back from child protective services.
",0.4404,0.9884,2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"All Billy Hope knew was how to fight inside of the ring but he was never prepared to take life's greatest punches in Kurt Sutter's Southpaw. As a young boy, Billy Hope is in the child protective service and gets into many fights. He doesn't have anyone to teach him how to take life's greatest punches. Until he meets his wife Maureen in the child protective service. She opens up a new door in his life and helps keep him in check.Southpaw begins with Billy Hope fighting recklessly in a match. He comes out bloody and beaten up. Maureen tells him to stop fighting recklessly otherwise he won't be around for her and their daughter. Billy's life takes a drastic turn when he lets his quick temper get in the way and he gets into a fight during a press conference with a newcomer who wants to challenge him. The fight ends in gunfire and Maureen is shot in the stomach. She dies before the ambulance is able to reach her, leaving Billy devastated. The one thing that was stable in his life is now gone, all because he lost his temper during a press conference. His actions become suicidal and his daughter Leila is taken away from him by child protection services. When the last remaining person that he loves is taken way from him, for the first time, Billy becomes determined to change himself for someone in order to get them back. After seeking a new trainer to help him train for an upcoming fight, Billy's entire character changes from cocky and not wanting to follow directions to wanting to follow the rules to get his daughter as soon as possible. He looks to the new trainer with admiration and realizes that Maureen would've liked the new trainer because they both care for his well being.Billy slowly becomes more responsible by maintaining his job and focusing on getting his daughter back. When Billy is called back to the court to determine if he can have his daughter back, the judge demos him not stable enough to get her back. After finding out that she has to stay another month in child services, Billy's daughter wishes that he were the one dead, not her mom. Billy is more determined than ever to win the boxing championship. This time it is not for the money, but for his daughter. His determination to get his daughter back is relatable because that is what I would do in Billy's situation. Come the day of the match, Billy fights responsibly and not with his anger. To end the fight, his trainer tells him to use a Southpaw. When his opponent is knocked out, Billy finally gets his daughter back. Proving to himself that he does have the skill to take life's greatest punches. This movie is a great example of perseverance and grit. I love how realistic the training and fighting scenes are. The characters are very relatable and the viewer is able to connect with the characters and experience the emotions that they are feeling. It's a good reminder that everyone, no mater the age and skill always has to work their way to the top in order to achieve what they want."
" Has All The Necessary Clich√©s, But None Of The Necessary Character Development
",0.0,0.8971,2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"Despite the fact that boxing really hasn't been all that relevant for quite some time, boxing movies (or ""fight movies"" in general) are a favorite of mine. I count the ""Rocky"" series, ""The Champ"", ""Real Steel"", ""The Fighter"", and ""Warrior"" to be some of my favorite films of all-time. The reason? Boxing movies really aren't about boxing. They are about revealing character. There may not be a more straightforward sport: hit the other person repeatedly until him or you can't continue. Yet, it is through that ferocious simplicity that great character stories can be told and relationship examined. Sadly, ""Southpaw"" doesn't do nearly a good enough job with that character/relationship-building, instead just content to throw out all the old boxing clich√©s and hope they meld into something inspirational. They do not.For a basic plot summary, ""Southpaw"" tells the story of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light- heavyweight champion at the top of his game. He has beaten all-comers, has a beautiful wife (Rachel McAdams), and a lovely daughter (Oona Laurence). The only problem? Billy can't walk away from any fight (in OR out of the ring) and it leads to a brawl in which a great tragedy befalls him and his family. Starting over basically from square one, Billy finds a new trainer in Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) and begins to rebuild both his own life and that of his newly-shaped family.Despite my earlier praise for the ""fight movie"" genre, many of its movies do use rather predictable clich√©s when dealing with the actual boxing portion of the flicks. In ""Southpaw"", every single one of those clich√©s is used in order to try and create a large amount of drama. There is the riches-to-rags-and-back-again story, the grizzled old trainer with the odd methods, the fracturing of the family life due to a violent sport, and the corruption of the entire business. Heck, ""Southpaw"" even rips off the old ""Rocky IV"" sequence of having interspersed shots of two boxing training with different styles...this time just set to an Eminem rap tune instead of a score.Unfortunately, all those clich√©s do is cover up for the fact that the characters in this movie are not well-written or well-conceived whatsoever, and the plot adds absolutely nothing new to the genre. It is completely hollow once you look past the surface material. Sadder still, there really isn't even anything that I can point to as being really good about the film, besides perhaps the acting of Gyllenhaal (which itself is even ""just okay"" as there is no dramatic meat for him to work with). To be honest, a more accurate rating of this film for me would be 1.5 stars. I'll round it up to two stars because it at least as some coherency to it, but that is truly the only reason. Nothing else made me care about what I was seeing.I was very disappointed in ""Southpaw"", as (when I first saw its trailers a few months ago) I predicted it would be perhaps the best movie I've seen all year. Boy, was that ever a ""punch to the gut"" (pardon the pun). Instead, it ended up as one of the most bland, hollow movies I've seen in quite sometime. Unless you've never seen a fight movie in your life and want to catch up on the mechanics of how they work, ""Southpaw"" will likely underwhelm you to the point of boredom. It just doesn't have any dramatic substance."
" Nothing new
",0.0,0.9722,2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"The movie is good, actors performance is excellent, but we have already watched excellent and even better similar movies in the past. I think that Raging bull, Million dollar baby, Cinderella man, Rocky ...etc. are much better !! I also recommend the wrestler or warrior if we want to extend the genre. If you haven't watched previous movies you will enjoy this movie, otherwise you will just find a remake or recompilation of some of the scenes of the previous mentioned movies."
" One of the bests of 2015
",0.0,0.9782,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Jake really lived the character Billy Hope....a perfect portrait. While winning at every thing just at that moment Hope lost everything.His wife,his daughter,his fame,his house everything.but eventually he won everything back at the cost of his wife though,that is totally heartbreaking...gaining back his fame & hugging his daughter at that moment make everything so much touchy Jake shook the whole earth up again...he never stops to amaze me...his emotion,his anger,his extremism,his passion,his love,his intensity everything couldn't be more accurate....he keeps me falling in love with him again & again & again.Finally a good movie after ages. It made my eyes teary ..a complete knockout i would say (just my opinion :P ) a sure watch movie."
