" AN EMPTY CHILDREN'S MOVIE MADE JUST TO MAKE MONEY
",-0.2023,0.0,2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,The movie offers nothing new and the characters are so hollow and graceless that it makes it just a regular movie that doesn't transcend beyond that.
" Soulless marketing scheme
",0.0,-0.9271,2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,"This studio is one of the worst, not just because they make bad mediocre films, but because they have changed the animation industry for the worse. No longer is children's entertainment about preparing them for the future, they have now turned it into some sort of money making machine with little to no regard about their audience. This is the definition of a shell of a film. Shame on Illumination."
" I hate minions
",-0.5719,-0.9323,2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a cheap cash grab made for 3 year old children. Not a single joke is funny. It was made exclusively to sell toys. The minions are the most obnoxious little things and they are the worst part of the movie. If the worst part of the movie is literally in it's name, you know it's a horrible film."
" this movie is fine garbage don't watch and stay away
",0.2023,-0.4019,2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,This movies sucks the writing is terrible and shouldn't be condoned I think they could've done way better on the character development it was actual trash
" Definitely NOT funny and a little inappropriate
",0.0757,-0.138,2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,"I watched this with my 5 year old and must say: so disappointed.It's a little violent at some places and weird. In one scene there were three guards dancing, throwing their clothes in the air and then spanking each other.Yeah, so i wish I could rate this movie less than one star.I might be over-reacting but this is completely INAPPROPRIATE for kids younger than at least 6."
" MINIONS
",0.0,0.7003,2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,Its cute.still watchable.all the jokes and gags are there.story is there.music is subdued.for rhythmic gymnastics they should win olympuc medals.
" Minions is annyoing and not funny.
",-0.3412,-0.5727,2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,"I watched movies with these characters, they are not funny, they are annoying. I recommend watching the YouTube video ""Grobir Reviewer evaluates: Overrated animated movies"", in which the critic and his companion looked at the trailers and video clips of things like ""Minions"" or ""Despicable Me"" and then started fighting the minions."
" Cheeky
",0.0,0.9291,2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,Such a fun and cheeky flick! The little minions are little rascals and super cute. Definitely in my top 10 favourite movies to watch.
" Umm...
",0.0,-0.9618,2020-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Did anyone ask this? This might be the worst family/spin-off ever made. When you decide to make spin-off about the side characters in different movies, they often found up bad. This film is an example of it. Minions are so annoying and don't fit as the main characters of a film. Scarlett Overkill is also an unmemorable villain. The plot is also lame and too simple."
" You can't spell WASTE OF MY GODDAMN TIME! Without minions
",-0.3073,-0.8848,2020-09-11 00:00:00,5,At least frozen was alright this on the other hand is a passable movie I think minions are a parasite that need to be wiped off the face of they earth but this film is just pass not good not bad just pass I'm gonna stop talking about it now because it's just a waste off my time!
" Normal movie
",0.0,0.5916,2020-08-30 00:00:00,6,"A average to good film, nothing special or new to push the movie into a exciting and memorable film"
" Nails On A Chalboard
",0.0,-0.67,2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie was really difficult to focus on. It was padded with filler, and the minions themselves are just repetitive, annoying testosterone pills that taint the big screens because general audiences are too stupid to buy anything of higher quality. Good for young kids, I guess, but not worth the watch."
" A worst movie.
",-0.6249,0.995,2020-08-21 00:00:00,1,I like minion jokes in despicable me but in here it is so boring to see.I think minions film is better that despicable but in my opinion the worst movie in whole series.They are doing silly jokes in here and they are not funny to me.I think this is a great fun for children under 5 years but this is not a fun for me and a very short story to me.A small story going around this story and no characters like in despicable me.Only minions.despicable me is much better than this movie.To me I want some comedy in animation movies or some adventure scenes like in toy story series.I think this a great comedy but I got really disappointed when I watch this and I an animation film must to more to entertain children and adults.To me still toy story 3 is the best animated movies to me.It is good for adults too and it is not boring.I think that is how a film would be.In this story only they are showing how they found a leader and nothing else.An animation must have a comedy scene anywhere.I know some like this but to me it is worst movie.I am not recommend it to others because it is boring to me.I hope a better minion movie will come to enjoy and have a fun.
" Despicable
",0.0,0.8357,2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,I liked the second and third act of the movie it was really good with action and the beginning was funny
" Legitimately the worst movie I have ever seen
",-0.6249,-0.2263,2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,I want my 90 minutes back. There is nothing redeeming about the movie at all. Avoid it at all costs.
" Silly and cute
",0.4767,-0.4836,2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,Is this movie a cynical cash-grab? Yes. Is the plot flimsy? Yes. Is this movie art? Oh hell no. As movies go you'll definitely see much better. You'll also see worse. Taking it at face value - a film aimed at five-year-olds who are going to whine at their parents for the tie-in products - its a adorkable time-waster that managed to keep my attention for the duration.
" Not as bad as I expected
",0.431,0.9494,2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"The minions have a reputation for being annoying characters so I was hesitant to watch this at first. It was better than I thought! True, the minions are only funny in small doses so their presence gets tiresome in a feature length movie, but there is a surprisingly heartfelt plot to tie it all together. However, the film is let down by some of the awkward and overly long gags that slowed down the film. Also, there is a big emphasis on Scarlet Overkill who is just not as interesting or memorable as Gru from the main Despicable Me series. To be honest, I had the most fun watching this film once I realised that the minions were actually speaking real languages and tried to guess the origins of each of their phrases."

",0.431,0.9494,2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"I was really put off by the annoying trailers and memes so I didn't watch this film for many years. Well, it was better than I thought. The minions are only funny in small doses so their speech gets tiresome but there is a surprisingly heartfelt plot to tie it all together. It is quite let down by some of the awkward gags that slowed down the film, and by Scarlet Overkill who is not as interesting or memorable as Gru.

" good entertainment for children
",0.6908,0.296,2020-05-20 00:00:00,4,"The film was silly, childish and funny, just the right thing for kids.
Adults will probably get bored, like me."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9574,2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,Very amazing. Very good. Very good. Very well. Beautiful
" Minions
",0.0,0.9744,2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Having mostly gibberish for script, this movie is a prove that visual antics and a few timely noises go a long way to induce laughter. In a throwback to classic setting and comedy, this spin-off might not be bigger than most animations in recent time, but it's still an enjoyable foray. The style of 60s world and era appropriate soundtracks enhance the atmosphere as these peculiar creatures dabble in feeble mischief.Story follows three particular minions on their way to find the most dreadful villain there is. The journey takes them across the globe until they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Graphic-wise Minions is presentable. Though not all of the set pieces are magic, some of the displays, such as the rainy night or monarch architecture are still engaging and presented with nifty details.The mostly simplistic nature works well, bringing visual cues and lots of squeaking mumbles. It doesn't use elaborate word plays, but this is actually an advantage as the humor is readily accessible for any casual viewer. Several of the jokes are distinctly amusing, though it doesn't fall flat even when a couple of them don't hit the high note.It also boasts notable pop references of the time, from the ironic quips and its zippy tunes. The human characters can be a bit stereotypical or over-the-top, since these are mostly spoof version of action flick baddies. Its actual villain portrayal might take the name Overkill way too seriously for comical purpose.The presentation for visual humor is fine and the references are easily relatable. Minions is not a cerebral endeavor or emotional adventure, though these awkward yellow simpletons are notoriously delightful."
" Saw a very happy movie
",0.6115,0.9892,2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"The first two movies are very good and very funny. The expressions and movements of the characters are very funny, especially the little yellow people, still so cute, sly. It was also cute to sing on the draft stage by mistake, which touched all the judges, even the tall and mighty muscle men were treated by them. The place to take a shower is completely occupied by them. The little yellow man practiced weightlifting, and two strong men helped lift the barbell. I'm laughing. The child is also very happy to see. The little yellow man is super strong and must be strong!"
" Sigh..
",0.0,0.9565,2020-04-21 00:00:00,4,"This is what started illuminations laziness and blandness. ""As long as this film will make money and it certainly will let's forget to work hard on a story like we used to"". I could imagine this movie being good but it just wasn't. It's got some funny parts but it's hard to tell a good story with generic main characters you can't understand. That's this films big issue, dialogue is bare. This entire movie in a nutshell: Stupidity followed by laughter, over and over, and over again. It's like if Seinfeld did an entire episode where Kramer just kept manically entering rooms. Where do you go when you need relief from the comic relief?4/10"
" Mediocre sequels
",0.0,-0.4023,2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,This derivative work looks mediocre and the story is not strong
" Fun heist
",0.5106,0.982,2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I'm kind of surprised that this was as good as at was. Considering the Minions don't speak English, I thought it wouldn't really work as a full length movie if most of it was in Minion-ese. However, it does work and somehow you can understand what they're saying perfectly. This is an absolutely hilarious film. I'd say it's one of the best of the year! It's even got references to the original ""Despicable Me"" movie. Most of the humor is visual, rather than from the writing. It was great seeing everything tie in from this prequel to the original movie. It helps explain some things. Although it took away my theory that Gru created the Minions, their real origin is no more ridiculous than mine. It's fun for the whole family, and I look forward to ""Despicable Me 3."" I need more Minions, and I need them now.Grade: A+. 10/10. 5/5 stars"
" unneccessary
",0.0,0.9134,2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,Unnecessary but cool. an animation that shouldn't exist but is a lot of fun. Minions are very good
" very funny
",0.4927,0.9097,2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,Very funny this animation for all ages. very beautiful and the history is awesome
" Makes you realize how much you miss Gru
",-0.1531,0.8505,2020-02-21 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately, this movie just really lacks the charm of the previous movies, and this is mainly due to the absence of Gru. My favorite moment was the very end when Gru turns up for a brief cameo. Hoping for better in Minions 2."
" Needed to exist.
",0.0,0.4767,2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Nothing close to the emotional powerhouse of the first two movies, this is simply a parade of gags of variable quality.A charismatic villain from an usually on point Sandra Bullocks enlivens the movie and overall it is a pleasant distraction for people fond of the franchise like me."
" Very Disappointing
",-0.5413,0.7855,2020-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Minions is not a bad movie, Let me get that out of the way, I know everyone hates this movie, But it's definitely not The Emoji Movie or Ice Age: Collision Course. Minions has good intentions and some very funny moments, But it suffers from the fact that characters like the Minions cannot sustain 91 minutes and that is very sad considering how funny they were in the first two Despicable Me films. It's not the worst film on the planet, But however it's very disappointing."
" Best Music Ever!
",0.6696,0.9459,2019-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Everyone's favorite little yellow guys are back for their very own movie! You don't necessarily have to watch the first Despicable Me to understand what's going on, the film is set B.G. (Before Gru) and tells the story of what a minion is and their purpose. The best part of the movie is without a doubt the great soundtrack! If you love music from the sixties you will love this movie!"
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9737,2019-10-23 00:00:00,10,Very good movie. Very funny. Awesome. The story is great. I thing that i laugh a lot. Its a great movie
" Thanks, I hate it
",-0.2023,-0.5526,2019-10-23 00:00:00,2,"Years ago, Illumination made this little movie called ""Despicable Me"", and it was a fine movie. But Minions? Oh naw, now this is a kind of kids movie that their families wouldn't understand on what is going on throughout the whole movie!! As we all know, Minions are getting old and will never see the lighter day by every single critics on the planet!!"
" Minions

" Too Much Whipped Cream
",0.0,0.9377,2019-09-04 00:00:00,6,"The Minions in the Despicable Me movies were used perfectly - within moderation and only for embellishment. A side-character is their role for a reason - because their isn't much more of a story beyond that (or at least one worth exploring).Giving the Minions their own movie is like putting too much whipped cream on a Sundae - too much of one loved added flavor that totally overrides the actual course of the meal. The Minions were the whipped cream that added great flavor to the movies, but making a whole meal out of a topping usually doesn't last long and in the end is not that great of an experience."
" My Review!
",0.0,0.5093,2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAFamily movie, Kid's and Adults laughed their guts out. lol.Peace Out!"
" Harmless but also charmless.
",-0.4939,0.9472,2019-08-25 00:00:00,5,"The first two Despicable Me films were charming and funny while the third one was trying to do too much with too many characters including the minions getting too much screen-time. And that's exactly what made their own movie subpar, they can be fun in small doses as background characters, but simply do not stand strong enough to be the main focus.I did not have any high expectations towards, because I thought to myself that I'd get exactly what the title promised me, a movie starring the minions doing funny stuff in different situations. But here's the thing, since the minions are supposed to be funny and disappointed in being exactly that, their solo movie ended up disapointing me.I guess if you absolutely love seeing the little yellow oddballs getting into trouble it'll be harmless, but everyone else will be disappointed. You have been warned, Minions does not posses the same heartfelt charm of the Despicable Me films."
" One of my personal favorite illumination films
",0.4588,0.7764,2019-08-19 00:00:00,8,I'd like to start off by saying that this movie is appeals to the younger audience . Aside from that it was a solid film .The antagonists are very unique and quirky . For this movie what they had to work with is minions and the end result is was very good . Walking into the theater to see this film for the first time with very low standards and I walked out very pleasantly surprised with the outcome.😀
" The law of the strongest (and of those around him)
",0.4404,-0.053,2019-08-18 00:00:00,6,"The intuition belongs just to the firsts two chapters of the saga. ""Minions"" works like more or less all the mascot spin-offs: his aim is confirm to the audience the reason of the mascot's success. So ""Minions"" is none other than a tracking shot of gags, supported by the fact that the yellow little monsters have to reach the despicable and associate with him. The most interesting element is in this archetypical need of survive and fraternization with the strongest specie: something of cruelly Darwinian is hidden behind the small banana-lovers. But for the rest, the line is weak: a movie to take for what it is, a funny tribute to a character impossible not to love. With also some undercurrent philosophical hint."
" Should have stayed as background characters.
",0.0,0.9658,2019-08-14 00:00:00,2,"Here's the thing, I liked the minion characters when they were introduced in ""Despicable Me"". They provided some of the comic relief but were generally harmless. But they made such a splash with kids they had a much larger role in the second movie which I felt was too much. Much like Mater, from Pixar's Cars, he was popular with the kids so they gave him a much larger role in the second movie to it's detriment. So it wasn't a surprise that Illumination decided to give the minions their own movie.The whole thing just feels soulless and corporate. And I admit the only reason I watched it was because I was on a plane and I had either seen or rewatched all the movies I wanted to see and figured it would at least help to pass the time. And it did. But I was not entertained nor did it help with the boredom I find myself in when flying.The problem with movies like this is they rely too heavily on a character or joke carrying the movie. In this case, it's the minions that need to be minions. They are supposed to follow the strongest and most powerful villain they can find whether it be a dinosaur, Napoleon or the main villain of this movie named Scarlet. And along the way they mess things up in their attempt to be minions to these villains. And that's the movie. Are you laughing yet?I totally get why they made it. Hollywood isn't interested in making a good movie. They're interested in making money so anything that could net them a profit is then produced. And in Illumination's case it's literally doing whatever they can as cheaply as possible.Sure their products look good and are popular with the kids but is is asking too much to have a movie that adults can appreciate too?"
" Boring and surprisingly violent
",-0.6124,-0.9313,2019-08-05 00:00:00,1,"Terrible movie, worse than I imagined. My girlfriend dragged me to see this atrocious waste of time after seeing Despicable Me. The attempts at humour in Minions were juvenile, tiresome and plain dumb. What's worse is the action sequences thrown in were excessively and unpleasantly violent, and I actually like mob movies."

" Unpoular opinion alert!! Better than despicable me!
",0.7163,0.9449,2019-07-07 00:00:00,7,"This is a very short statement, so here we go.This Movie is better than despicable me in my opinion, not as good humor... But has a better villan, and that alone is enough. I did NOT like the antagonist in despicable me. And some people may say that a better villan does not make a better movie... But i disagree. Can you replace the villan of this Movie with any other one and would it stay the same movie? No.So yeah, better villan, and for me... A better movie.But if you like a more structured movie, then go watch despicable me."

It is lazy, incoherent and mindless. Everytime it trys to be funny it comes out as obnoxious and rude to the viewer.
This wasn't a movie, it was an ad for the insane amounts of merchandise that was inevitably made. Minions is like a much worse Lego Movie.
Any hidden good points are really just invalidated by this movies true sinister intentions.
I hate this movie so much.
It's a shame I can't rate this lower than 1.

Minions is such kind of animated movie which fantazises you to go into their innocent world.
The minions are really cute and you tend to adore them in the whole movie. The innocence showcased is pretty creative and fun to watch.Kevin, Bob and especially Stuart are really mind-boggling but I was a bit dissapointed with the villain's character. The animation of the movie is just awesome.
If you like animated movies I would definitely recommend you to watch this movie."

",0.5563,0.9587,2019-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I'll never forget the first time I watched this film. I woke up early, pulled off my minions blanket, ran to the bathroom, pulled aside the minions shower curtain and began my shower, thinking all about the movie that would change me forever. Fast forward a few hours to the midday showing of minions, as my stepdad drove me to the movie theater, I honestly had moderate-severe anxiety. It's like the feeling you get right before graduating middle school, so many feelings of excitement. I have to admit though, I've never felt more confident with my appearance as I stepped foot into my local 2 star theater decked out in my minions overalls, as well as my minions gloves & boots. I walked up to the front counter ""minions for one please"" i said as I handed the attendant my weekly allowance. ""Would you like any snacks or popcorn?"" Asked the attendednt. ""Oh no thanks, I'm fine"" I replied. But little did they know, inside my overall pouch lay hidden away, 3 minions twinkies, and of course 1 ripe BA-NA-NA, so I could maximize my viewing experience. I walked to theater number 4 & found a sweet front row seat, directly in front of the screen. Eventually the trailers came to an end and the lights began to dim. ""Here we go"" I said as I pulled my minions goggles over my eyes. The next hour and a half was pure ecstasy."

",0.5777,0.9499,2019-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Gosh, I'm fascinated to see how critical a lot of the reviews for this movie are. Quite honestly, I don't watch animated flicks to pick them apart for how bad they are, I'm just looking for a little entertainment. I think the Minions are an incredibly cute bunch that resonate very comically with their Minionese gibberish. The film and story were OK by me, I liked the Sixties soundtrack with a little Turtles, a little Doors, a little Hendrix and a little Monkees, with a nice nod to the Beatles with the Abbey Road sequence. I have to be honest though about the celebrity voice cast, it's entirely lost on me, as I don't research who's doing what character before watching, and can't really identify them while the picture's in progress. It's an opinion I've shared before in some of my other reviews, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference to me if the characters were voiced by some unknowns looking to break into the business. The only thing that bothered me about the picture, if that's the right word, is that the Minions were on an ages long search for a villain boss. Why a villain boss, when the little, yellow corn balls are such a delight otherwise? I actually have a five year old nephew that looks just like one of these Minions, without being oval and jaundiced looking. He even talks a little bit like a Minion, which is more a function of my hearing impediment than his elocution. All I can say is, you can have some fun with this flick if you aren't as critical as some of the haters out there. Gee, lighten up a bit, it's for the kiddies."

Cause don't forget, the stars of those movies are these yellow small people! So here you find them as the main characters and the funny begins!The plot is not bad at all. The idea is that they explain us where do the Minions come from and what were they doing before being with Gru. So that means, one funny scene after another. They are going everywhere to find the baddest ass ever, and finally the find Scarlet (voiced by Sandra Bullock, who really gets into character). Then, the fun continues and goes on, and goes on.There isn't much of a dialogue here, well there is, but please let me know if you understand anything that they say about it! Which is even more hilarious cause you might get some words in your language (whatever the language is). So, if you wanna laugh go and watch it, cause remember, the Minions were the best thing in the Despicable Me movies, so now they don't need to steal the show as they have their own one!Just one more thing: BANANA!PS: Stay until the end credits and some more"
" One star, but only because we cannot rate a film no stars
",0.3252,0.9821,2018-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Minions - good grief. An hour and a half that I will never get back.Back in 2015 my son went with his cub/scout group, for a special treat, to see this movie. When he got back I asked him how it was; as a family we all liked the Despicable Me films, and this was part of the deal. Surprisingly he was a little reticent - he loves going to the cinema - and non committal. I now know why.This is an utter abortion of a film. They could have made 18 five minute cartoons, or maybe two good ones, rather than invest the time this move took to drag out in a full length feature.There was a plot; not a good one, admittedly, and - weak and lame as it was - it looked like someone had taken just two minutes to outline it on one side of a damp sheet of toilet paper. In crayon.
There were characters; again, not good ones (mostly forgettable, in fact) and the director appeared to have tried to make up for the lousy plot by telling most of the voice talent to ham it up like their lives depended on it. There was also quite a bit on national stereotyping, always the sign of a lazy scriptwriter, or a director looking for an easy life.
Even the animation appeared to be of a lower calibre than the usual Despicable Me quality (!); maybe because this was a movie set in the past, possibly to give the trainees and apprentices some on the job experience, but I suspect it was more just to save money.
The soundtrack was the best thing about this film, but then all you can credit Illumination with is choosing it; yet the target audience is 15 and under - who amongst them is going to listen to or even care about a bunch of songs from nearly 50 years ago?I like the Minions, as characters. It is a concept that has a history in slapstick, and they can be as violent as can be gotten away with in cartoon form because they are quite obviously not human and appear to be indestructible. They work well as criminal, erm, minions in the Despicable Me films and they do make for amusing five minute fillers on the DVDs; this was one or two five minute cartoons stretched full length and packed with filler to pad out the slack. And there was lots of slack.I doubt if we'll see a Minions 2 anytime soon. I certainly hope not, anyway.
But then, at the time, we would have thought the same about Sing..."

They reused assets from other movies and used the same assets over and over again. There are continunity error all over the place. The story is that the minions want a new master but when they find one they kill her right away!

It depicts their search for the most evil genius in order to obey him and serve.I really like the idea, it is a clever concept to turn around the usual search for a hero and make the main characters search for a villian instead. However, I think producers soon noticed that there is a little problem with that because there sure is a reason why magically the plot stops before the beginning of the two World Wars. Apart from that it is a so-so animation movie, including some nice and funny moments and parts that seem a bit unnecessary. I didn't get the feeling that they just wanted to milk the cash cow but unfortunately this is not more than average.All in all this film shows the difficulties of including actual history in what is supposed to be a funny animation movie for kids.

For one thing, I just didn't feel like I was laughing as much as I expected and some of the dialogues and jokes just didn't feel, well, ""Despicable Meish"" as much. It did have a solid ending I will say (most people could probably just as well guess what it is story-wise if they know the series enough). As I would agree with one other audience critic: it did lack the Despicable Me charm I will admit, which is really the only real negative to this besides one of my overall opinions: I feel like it would be hard to make a film only starring the minions (Gru stole both shows the most I would say, with even the minions not quite making second place).

It moves around the world and while of course there are going to be stupid parts, if you come in expecting a movie about little yellow guys, the nice touches on the parts of the minions traveling through New York in the 1960s and the beginning with the minions evolving from organisms go a long way.

So we spend an hour and a half that we'll never get back watching them trying to find their appropriately evil master.Sure. It's cute. So cute, in fact, that it comes across as almost a kiddie movie. Which is completely unlike the ""Despicable Me"" movies, which were enjoyable to people of all ages. But in those movies, the story was driven not by the minions, but by the evil Gru - who made things a lot of fun and added a touch of humanity and even emotion to the story. But basically in this, it's the minions. Yes, there's Scarlet Overkill - but did anybody really take Scarlet Overkill seriously as an evil super-villain? It's certainly possible to get a few chuckles out of the minions playing around and being silly - but it wears pretty thin after about the first 15 minutes or so, without any ""meat"" to go along with it.I confess that this finally put me into a stupor and I nodded off for a little bit -
 meaning that I actually missed how it was that the minions managed to save England. And I didn't really care. I'm just glad that I did wake up in time to see the best part of the movie - when the minions finally find their true master - the young Gru! (4/10)"

Neither Sandra Bullock's ""Scarlett Overkill"" nor Jon Hamm's ""Herb Overkill"", the principal speaking characters, added much to the story and I quickly grew tired of the Minion gibberish/language. Comedy may be the most subjective of genres, so this is especially ""IMO"" but, unlike ""Despicable Me"" (2010), I didn't find ""Minions"" to be either particularly humorous or particularly entertaining (never-the-less, it made a boatload of money, so others must have)."

So here's the plot, the minions are in a search for a master(villain) and one becomes the king of England another one Jacuzzis with two fire hydrants just to make an innuendo for some weird reason, the plot always falls into plot twist and they are not even consistent.And on that year they discouraged kids to watch the lego movie even though it shows good morals and responsibility, they want to dumb them out by watching a minions movie how stupid is that"
" Good silly fun

We see how they have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, always trying to find the most evil beings to serve and then accidentally kill! Eventually they can find nobody to serve and as the centuries pass they fall into a depression. One day Minion Kevin decides to do something about it; he, along with sidekicks Stuart and Bob set off to find a new evil master to serve. They find themselves in New York in 1968; there they hear that Villain-con is taking place in Orlando. They make their way there and find themselves working for top villain Scarlet Overkill. She has plans to take over England; the first stage is to get the Minions to steal the crown not surprisingly things don't go quite as Scarlet hoped and then the Minions are in her sights.The little yellow minions were one of the highlights of the' Despicable Me' films so it isn't a surprise that they got their own film. The main story isn't particularly original but that isn't too much of a problem as it is just an excuse to put the minions in a variety of amusing situations where all their attempts to help their new mistress lead her to think they are actually working against her. Most of these set pieces are pretty funny in a way that should amuse children of all ages and adults who enjoy slapstick silliness. The '60s setting provides a good excuse to incorporate music of the era; sometimes sung in the minions' gibberish! The story ends nicely in a way that links into 'Despicable Me'. The animation is impressive with good character designs and detailed backgrounds. Overall I'd say this was a lot of fun and would recommend it even if it isn't quite up to the quality of 'Despicable Me' it is very silly but it is also a lot of fun."

The characterization of Minions are excellent and Visual Effects (CGI, VFX) are brilliant. The movie looks very good visually. I watched the movie in 3D and one can literally feel all the little Minions jumping out of the screen.The performance of Pierre Coffin (as the Minions), is must watch and it is positive point of the movie. Its entertaining and worth watching. Minions is directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. The directors have done a satisfactory jobs in creating a good prequel/spin off Minions Movie. Their creative vision of crafting those awesome and amazing little Minions is amazing. The performances are good. Pierre Coffin as the Minions is great. The character of Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill is OK, but not up too the mark, somehow it misses the perfection mark. Michael Keaton and Geoffrey Rush as supporting characters were OK, and the rest of the cast characters were good but sidelined.Minions has lots of flaws too. The story plot structure is bad, the script and screenplay seems to be underwhelming at certain times and there is no strong support to the movie from the story point of view. There are lots of unnecessary and underdeveloped characters, especially the character of Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) is very under utilized and does not feel too good. The story plot line is somewhat weak, its like anything is happening anytime without any proper effect.Minions are delight to watch.

If you want to get an idea of much you might enjoy this film (out of 10), you can simply take the inverse of your age and multiply it by 10. For example, a 1 year old would rate this film a 10/10 and a 25 year old will enjoy this film 0.4/10.OK now onto the real review. I'll first preface this by saying I really liked the first Despicable Me, and I watch many animated comedies - I'm not some sad old man with no sense of humor. But the attempted comedy in this film is so dry and stupid that it's honestly hard to laugh. Perhaps you can laugh out of pity. At least the emoji movie is a film had expectations so low and responses so bad that we could laugh about it. All this film does is have minions laugh and ""speak"" (more like make random sounds) in an annoying voice. Honestly there's no way you wouldn't hate minions after watching this film. The jokes in this film are unoriginal and poorly integrated.Plot: There is no plot.Characters: Lol. (can you really call minions ""characters"" when they have no personality and all look the same?) Setting: OK I'll be honesty, the animation and setting is pretty well made, but there's no reason to watch it for that.

However, three brave Minions named Kevin, Bob and Stuart start feeling that they should have a boss and decide to leave the freezing climates and head North. They eventually end up in 1968 New York City and start to look for a boss. They eventually come across an ad for the most evil villain in the world at the time, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and head to Orlando to work for her. They eventually get chosen and Overkill and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) reveals her next evil scheme which is to try to steal the crown of Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders) and the rest of the movie is basically indescribable chaos.The biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the movie is not very funny. Don't get me wrong though, the movie does have humorous moments including the aforementioned opening scene and a pretty hilarious scene involving a crazy family played humorously by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney. Aside from those two moments, I was hoping something funny would occur, but nothing really made me laugh. This is where I realized that the movie was lacking something. It was lacking the other characters that made the ""Despicable Me"" series work. It needed characters like Gru, Dr. Nefario, Lucy, the girls, Gru's mother. The newer characters just weren't that funny or interesting. I also thought Scarlet Overkill wasn't that evil especially with her extremely weak crime that she's committing. The film doesn't even really have that much of a story. I honestly don't know what it was going for and felt like it was just there to make jokes which was the most likely reason. ""Minions"" was a real disappointment. It has some humorous moments, but not a lot of them. It just doesn't really have the charm that the ""Despicable Me"" movies were so good at capturing. It's honestly a harmless waste of time for very young kids, but it's certainly not something for the whole family."
" This One's Just For The Kiddos
",0.0,0.9812,2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Nowadays, when I see an animated movie like this, I pretty much expect it to entertain me as much as the target audience of children. The bar has been set that high. Unfortunately (at least for me), this one is pretty much just for the kiddies.For a basic plot summary, ""Minions"" tells the story of, well, the Minions! While the little mischief- makers were well established in the Despicable 1/2 films, this one explains how they came to meet Gru. For thousands of years, they wandered the earth looking for the meanest bad guy to serve, from cavemen to dinosaurs to Yetis. In more recent times, they fall in with Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who is intent on stealing the Royal Crown (quite literally) from the Queen of England (Jennifer Saunders). As per usual, the Minions' frantic antics make this an almost impossible task, with one even being crowned King himself (King Bob!).Simply put, ""Minions"" is a fun romp for any audience of children. The gags will elicit laughs, and just the concept of Minions in general is still enough to hold interest. Kevin, Bob, & Stuart (the main three Minions featured) will enthrall kids for the whole 90 minute runtime.Because of how high the animation bar has been set, though, I can't help but rate ""Minions"" a pedestrian 3-stars by my own standards. Maybe that isn't fair to the film, but it is from my own personal perspective. This one doesn't have, say, the wry humor of a ""Toy Story"", and emotional punch of other Pixar efforts, or even the sincere sweetness of its two predecessors. It's just silly, goofy fun.So, if you have kids, put this on and it will be a rollicking hour and a half of laughter. Just don't expect to become invested in the cartoonish fun like you probably have been in the past."
" Stupid but Harmless
",0.0772,0.9941,2017-02-16 00:00:00,5,"The first two Despicable Me movies were delightful movies, thanks to the relationship between Gru and the girls, the interesting stories, and of course the cute minions. For some reason, they became the most popular characters in the series, so much so that Universal wanted to make a movie based off these guys. Where do I begin on how that doesn't work? 1) The narrator. This guy speaks in the beginning and end of the movie. While I don't hate the narrator completely it causes the audience to lose investment in the characters, because the narrator is doing their job of figuring out the situation or letting any emotion sink in. 2) How do you make a movie solely about the minions? It was one thing to make a movie about the Madagascar Penguins, because they were great stand alone characters. The Minions on the other hand have little to no personality and speak mixed languages (with no subtitles added). The only reason they were likable in the first two movies was, because they were cute side characters that could make anything they did mindlessly adorable, and they were under the main character's leadership. Even the movie knows that on their own, they aren't that great, so the writers just throw the minions into whatever crazy thing they think of, from the evolution of the characters to one getting crowned king for pulling out a sword, causing Elizabeth the Second to resign, to constantly finding a new master. 3) The villain. Scarlet Overkill is built up to be the greatest super villain of all time. What is her big diabolical plan to prove her worth? Steal the Queen of England's crown. Pretty underwhelming plan. It would be more impressive if her plan had been to kill the queen and become queen in her place. Also, in the end, she's defeated by boy Gru. That's gotta be a sad day for a villain to be defeated by a child. And she's pretty whiny. Why are the supposed to be ""greatest villains"" whiny? While her weaponized dress is cool, her plan and character development are just not that impressive. 4) The ending. (SPOILERS) So Scarlet's defeated, the minions return Elizabeth's crown, she knights them, they're heroes, they come across young Gru, and follow him to be villains again. The motivation all along had been for them to find an evil leader to assist. Now they're England's greatest heroes and are their own masters. Inserting Gru and reminding us of the motivation at the last minute was the movie shortcutting its way into trying to tie into the Despicable Me series. It doesn't work anymore. They're heroes and their own masters. The minions now have no point in working for Gru anymore now that they're worshiped by England, since they would be given anything they wanted now. Okay so is there anything good? The animation's good of course. The weapons Scarlet gives the three minions are awesome and I'd love to see them in the third Despicable Me movie. Please put the lava gun, hypnotic hat, and stretchy suit in Despicable Me 3! Occasionally the minions are allowed to have a few emotional moments when the narrator doesn't get in the way, and it always feels genuine. And as much as I hate to admit it, gigantic Kevin kinda makes the movie worth at least one viewing. Aside from that, the movie's completely pointless. It's not a terrible movie; it's just stupid while also being harmless. I still refuse to believe it's the prequel of the Despicable Me movies. I still stand with my theory that the minions are vitamin pills that Gru brought to life."
