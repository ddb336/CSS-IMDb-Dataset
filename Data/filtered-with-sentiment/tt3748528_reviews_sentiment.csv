" unnecessary
",0.0,0.1655,2021-03-26 00:00:00,5,It is a cool sience-fiction film but noone asked for this. It's such obvious that this movie is only made for money and nothing else....
" Of the best Star Wars movies
",0.1531,0.8625,2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"An excellent film from start to finish, with an unparalleled variety and characterization of characters, the most serious story of the entire saga and the most consistent with its universe; a final battle scene unprecedented in the series, the most heroic sacrifice of the series and of course, spectacular cameos that did not feel like filler. One of the best of the saga without a doubt."
" Second time falling asleepar Wars movie
",-0.6369,-0.4215,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,I've got to say this is the first first time I had no interest in watching what happens in a Star Wars film. I fell asleep in the cinema.
" This is what Star Wars is supposed to be
",-0.5574,0.9874,2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This movie is definitely not the best Star Wars movie but it is definitely a good one. This new set of characters is very fun and the way they are written and the way they are presented to us helps us to like them and to relate to them. When they die, it doesn't hurt as much as it would a regular Star Wars character, but it still hits because we went on an adventure with them and were able to experience what they went through. The most amazing aspect of this film was definitely Darth Vader. I like how the creators of this movie really dug into the potential that Darth Vader has and presented it in this film to the best of their ability, and I am so satisfied with the result. I just wish that people would see that this movie is really, really well made and worth a spot in the Star Wars top 5 movies."
" weapon plans
",-0.296,0.2263,2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I didn't think this needed to be made but it really works because of it shows how difficult it was to get the death star plans for ""a new hope"".Darth vader's scene from the beginning of ""a new hope"" at the end was awesome seeing."
" This is Star Wars
",-0.5574,0.6486,2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"The title says it all really, this film feels like a Star Wars movie, it keeps with the original trilogy and is a great entry into the universe."
" A masterpiece
",0.6249,-0.5574,2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,"This has become my favourite star wars movies, hands down"
" A Martin Scorsese version of Star Wars, grim and disheartening
",-0.8779,0.7322,2021-03-04 00:00:00,2,"In the adventure classic The African Queen, the heroes had a very dark ending. Thankfully, director John Huston changed his mind, showing that after all they had gone through they had earned the right to a better fate.What does this have to do with Rogue One? I think that this movie would have done far better if John Huston had been directing. This movie is a cynic's delight and its entire purpose for existing is to fill the details about the lives lost retrieving the plans to the Death Star. Pointless, heartless, and with a perverse ending."
" The Rogue Star Wars Story
",-0.5574,0.9768,2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"ROGUE ONE is significantly darker than most SW films, and in mostly good ways. Its atmosphere reminded me a bit of Empire, which is my favorite SW, so that's probably one of the main reasons I loved it so much. It's really good besides that, though, notwithstanding Vader's dad joke (yike). The music was pretty underwhelming, especially considering how good Giacchino usually is. Anyway, this is better than most SW films, like TLJ, AOTC, TROS, and TPM."
" Emphasis on Wars
",-0.5574,0.8957,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Great story, great characters, and the best battle scenes of the entire franchise"
" Yeah that felt right
",0.296,0.8619,2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I don't know how, or why, but this movie felt just right.I liked everything in there, and the lack of jedi are a great plus. It is interesting to see for a change, normal people in a galaxy far far away to strangle with the state of their world and try to do something for it.No space wizards that magically make your problems disappear.What was a hit right in the childhood however was the space fight scene with the cut scenes from the original films with red and gold leader. Oh that brought back memories ok!Also in the end that they die on Scarif, yeah that was a great closure. There is no need to ALWAYS have every good guy survive. They died heroes and that made them memorable!"
" Great Addition to Star Wars Story
",0.128,0.4404,2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,Excellent film that fills in the gaps between episodes 3 & 4. Also a brilliant stand alone Star Wars film..
" Another good movie in the STAR WARS franchise
",-0.347,-0.6198,2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"I have always liked the STAR WARS movies, especially the first one, and I saw almost all the recent ones. Of the recent ones my favourite is THE FORCE AWAKENS and I knew I had to see this one. And while I didn't found it excellent, I still liked it.As there are more than 1,830 reviews to date, I'll briefly summarize the plot and I'll talk about what struck me most.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a rebel scientist forced by the Empire to build a weapon of massive distruction known as the Black Death. Jyn has tried for 15 to forget her dad, until a pilot doesn't give her a message of returning home immediately.. Along with Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his droid, the girl goes on a voyage for finding her dad and stop the apocalyptic plans of the dictator.The design is very good as always and the creatures and robots are very nice to look at. Although there is even C3PO joining the ride, the characters are not designed with marketability towards children and it makes for a movie for older audiences. One of the few low points of this movie is that especially toward the ending almost everyone dies (and it has a few cameos by some famous actors of these years). The locations are great, especially the tropical ones towards the end.Overall, a pretty good entry in the franchise very worth watching."
" On par with the original Star Wars movies
",-0.3182,-0.4845,2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"I think this is on par with the original three Star Wars movies. If you liked the original three but did not like the three newest episodes VI, VII, and VIII made around 2015 to 2020, then you will probably like Rogue One. Rogue One is very like the style and story line of the original three movies."
" I wouldn't say I overly enjoyed it, but it's worthy for the purpose it serves
",0.4587,0.9735,2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"A pretty cool prequel to 1977's 'Star Wars'. I wouldn't say I overly enjoyed it, but it's worthy for the purpose it serves.What stopped me from loving 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' was probably, mostly, the pacing, which I found to be too slow in parts. It never majorly affected my viewing experience, but I could feel it slightly dragging here and there. I also didn't like the cast on anything more than a neutral/standard level.Felicity Jones does an admirable job in the lead role, I did like how they set her story up at the beginning. I also found any scene with Mads Mikkelsen good to watch, while Riz Ahmed and Forest Whitaker are solid; Alan Tudyk is OK as well. Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn, however, didn't do anything for me.The story itself is satisfactory, the ending to it is more meaningful than I was expecting and features a few nice shots; the whole film looks lovely in fairness. I personally would've shaved 10-20 minutes off the run time and got more devilish antagonists, though.Still, it's at the very least a good film no doubt."
" Best Star Wars film since episode 5
",0.1531,0.0,2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,This had a ton of heart and story. Completely blows the new trilogy out of the water.
" The Best of the Star Wars Universe films by far
",0.1531,-0.7713,2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Never my the Skywalkers. They're cool, but they can't hold a candle to the Rogue Squadron. Action on the ground, in the air and in Space, with some very familiar characters thrown in to boot. If you're not a fan of the Star Wars films particularly, give this standalone/add-on film a go.."
" Best Modern-Day Star Wars Movie
",0.1531,0.9209,2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"This one movie beats the entire sequel trilogy by far. I'm not going to say any spoilers, but it kept me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it in theaters. Wonderful characters. This is definitely a movie I can watch multiple times and never get sick of."
" A story of the rebellion
",-0.128,-0.8009,2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not about the Skywalkers, it is about the rebellion against the Empire. This movie is my personal favorite star wars. People may ignore it when watching Star Wars because it is a ""spin-off"".
This movie shows us a side of the Empire which we hadn't seen before in the movies. We had seen many battles in the Original Trilogy but this movie just depicts it in a very different way.""Stardust"" is the name of the DeathStar project, and to Galen Erso that means his daughter, but to the empire it just means that the DeathStar is capabale of turning planets into dust.
I loved the characters in the movie, they don't feel forced at all and the last scene when the DeathStar is used to destroy the city, they know that they'll die, but in the long run they know it matters. Even as they die, they have hope. Another thing about this movie is that it shows us the suffering which the original trilogy ignores and i understand that, because they were targeted more at younger audiences, but regardless older audiences love them too. It shows us what it was like on Jedha when it was destroyed. The emotions. A New Hope shows Alderaan being destroyed but it doesn't have much emotion associated with the destruction of Alderaan in it.
Perfection"
" Amazing.
",0.5859,0.7964,2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"Incredible casting, incredible story, incredible soundtrack. Basically an incredible film altogether. By far Disney's best star wars film and fits in perfectly with the original 6 film trilogy."
" The Best Star Wars ""Story""
",0.1531,-0.9993,2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"A captivating tale away from the common combats, lightsaber duels and classic 'good guy vs bad guy'. 'Rogue One' is a Star Wars story showing life away from the legendary Skywalker's and Jedi Knights, mentioning those who weren't initially credited for their work in the saga. The film opens with Research Scientist Galen Erso and family hiding on the desolate planet of Lah'mu, Galen is played by Mads Mikkelsen (who you may know from the Carlsberg adverts) and embodies the caring father stereotype, as seen in his nickname 'Stardust' designated to his daughter Jyn. An Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star - a mobile space station and galactic super weapon formulated to wipe out any planet - Galen's wife, Lyra, is killed in the confrontation while Jyn escapes into a nearby cave. Worried about the uncertainty of her parents, young Jyn is soon rescued by by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera. The journey advances 15 years from that night and features Cargo pilot Bodhi Rook who defects from the Empire, transporting a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon, Jedha. The Rebel alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star from an informant and frees Jyn from an imperial labour camp at Wobhani. The introduction co-protagonist Cassian Andor is a very much ordinary officer, brave in his work but lives life at max pace, determined to complete missions and follow his orders. His appearance is typical, a belt holding a firing pistol and a fitted leather jacket, with the occasional fluffy coat when necessary. Andor brings Jyn to Rebel leader Mon Mothma, who tells her to find and rescue Galen so that the alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him. Jyn, Cassian and reprogrammed imperial droid K-2SO travel to Jedha - where the Empire is removing Kyber Crystals from the holy city to power the Death Star. Gerrera and partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against members of the Empire. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Îmwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus. The pair also differ from the Jedi characteristics; Îmwe is a peaceful warrior who's instinct combines with his wisdom, making him so successful in battle, with the use of his dynamic lightbow. Baze is a powerful figure, who's forceful blaster proves extremely effective in combat, he particularly stands out with his layered uniform and distinctive long hair. Jyn reunites with Gerrera, he shows her Galen's message, stating he had secretly built a vulnerability in the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial databank on the planet Scarif. On the Death Star Krennic commands a low-powered test shot of the super weapon, which destroys Jedha's capital. Gerrera had been holding Bodhi Rook captive and Jyn takes him and her group away from Jedha. Gerrera remains to die with dignity amongst the city. Grand Moff Tarkin (another Imperial leader) congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take the lead on the project. To pause and consider the film so far, it is evident that the Empire are fixated on completing the Death Star, a weapon that can't be surpassed; their finalisation is set to be counteracted by the Rebellion who are aware that this weapon has the ability to cause major damage. The last minute response by the Rebellion issues conflict on the Empire, who lead by Darth Vader, need all the fire power in the Galaxy to prevent the Rebellion succeeding. Bodhi Rook, a man with great knowledge of the Empire, leads the group to Galen's imperial research facility on the planet Eadu, where Mikkelsen's character is located, in an emotional reunion with his daughter Cassian recognises how he makes her feel, and disobeys his orders, refusing to shoot him. Before Rebel bombers attack the facility, Jyn shares a moment with her father, who she hasn't seen for 15 years, the bombers take aim and Galen is wounded mortally - leading to his inevitable death in the arms of his daughter. Jyn, mastered by Felicity Jones, possesses extreme courage throughout the film, even when she is a young girl she lives with the harsh reality that she may never see her parents again, her progress through the watch is phenomenal, her bravery and leadership skills flourish, not to mention her knowledge of the Galaxy and the Empire's threat. She escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial Cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by Vader to answer for the Eadu attack. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the Emperor, but Vader, instead force chokes him, ordering him to ensure no further breaches occur. The feeling of trepidation sets in on the Star Destroyer, and an anxious Darth Vader is concerned that his plans may deteriorate. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time we see Darth Vader in action fully suited, in order of the episodes, 'Rogue One' follows Episode 3 'Revenge of the Sith', the last time we saw the evil villain, he was medically treated and on the verge of death. Jyn in all her wisdom makes a plan to steal the schematics for the Death Star, with the help of the Rebel fleet. But with her lack of experience, she fails approval from the Alliance council, who feel victory against the Empire is impossible. Leaving Jyn frustrated, she leads a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank themselves - referencing to the title, they are going 'rogue'. Upon arrival at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs as ""Rogue One"", disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO, while other Rebels attack the Imperial garrison as a diversion. K-2SO sacrifices himself so that Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data - personifying the form of teamwork. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploys in support. Îmwe the great blind warrior is killed after incredibly activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, Malbus is killed in action shortly after. Rook is killed by a launched grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics but are ambushed by Krennic. The Imperial leader is shot and wounded by Andor. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin in all his wickedness sets of another low-powered shot to destroy the compromised base; killing Krennic, Cassian, Jyn and all remaining ground Imperial and Rebel forces. The Rebel fleet prepare to jump to hyperspace, however, many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's arriving Star Destroyer. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and kills many of the Rebel troops in a bid to regain the schematics, but a small starship escapes with the plans onboard. Aboard the ship, a familiar Princess Leia declares the schematics will provide hope for the rebellion. An intense and despondent finale of a brilliant film. Presenting the unsung hero's of the Rebellion, each individual took a risk and sacrificed themselves, for the future of others."
" Slow, poor script
",-0.4767,0.8128,2021-01-18 00:00:00,3,"Felicity Jones almost rescues this film but even with her talent there is a maximum one can do with no script. She does a lot with her face and posture but really needs some memorable words to give her character a character.
It is slow, serving only to remind us why the first film, with its bouncing plot, simmering chemistry and punchy dialogue, was so successful. If Rogue One had been the first in the franchise, there would have been no franchise."
" Solid movie
",0.1531,0.9837,2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I guess it's not a very unique opinion that I find this to be the one good Star Wars movie to come out of Disney (Solo is ok, but not as good; the sequel trilogy is horrible, all three movies).
That is not to say the movie is perfect; CGI Tarkin and Leia for instance, are not quite right and Leia especially takes me out of the movie by how ""fake"" she looks. Then again, these kind of things are somewhat inevitable given at what point in time the story is set. That also answers some of the accusations of ""nostalgic pandering"". The movie shows a lot of things we know from the OT, to make us think back of that time, and therefore like it. Examples are: TIE's, x-wing''s, AT-AT, AT-ST, Death Star, etc.
But the thing is, for me, unlike in the sequel trilogy, it makes sense here. In the sequel trilogy we randomly run into the Falcon which seems to have been luckily standing around, ready to fly, on that same desert planet. And there is the old type Star Destroyer, and Rey lives in an AT-AT. 30 years after the fact.
But in Rogue One, the story literally takes place about a week before A New Hope. So of course we would see the same vehicles in action (in fact, I'd argue it is more of an issue that we see different crafts, like the U-wing and the other TIE model that we never see in the OT). People also take issue with the R2 and C3PO cameo; but it makes sense that they would be there.
But still, showing Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba threatening Jyn on Jedha is taking it a step too far; not only where they apparently lucky enough to leave Jedha before it was blown up, but they also happened to go to Tatooine next, in time to get one of their arms cut off by Obi Wan? That is too much.So, you could certainly argue that the decision to set a movie at this point in time is nostalgic pandering, and to an extent it certainly is. But I'd rather have a good story with pandering than a bad story with just as much pandering (i.e. the sequel trilogy). And I much prefer Jyn to Rey. Yes, her arc is pretty fast (or thin): she doesn't want to be involved, and then her dying father convinces her, that's it, basically. But Rogue One only had one movie (instead of three), and she is not perfect in everything like Rey. And of course, she actually dies in the end, which is certainly an interesting decision!"
" Super boring
",0.3818,0.7184,2021-01-14 00:00:00,2,"This is a story that was already told in A New Hope. So it's basically a long re-telling of something that was covered in one sentence in an earlier, better, film.
I got bored after a short time, and then turned it off half way through, as I had been given no reason in the first half to care about what happened in the second half."
" Good movie, forgettable Characters
",0.4404,0.6901,2021-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Overall this movie is very good. It has great action, both in the ground and in space. It has a story that fills one of Star Wars' biggest plot holes, and is edited nicely and has a great score too. It even has some nice callbacks/cameos to rebels and clone wars characters. The only problem with this film is the main characters are kind of forgettable. Jyn or Cassian don't really offer anything new in terms of characters in the Star Wars characters and while characters like k2 or Chirrut have some great lines and moments they're kind of just gimmick characters with no real depth. The others on the rouge one crew hardly get their name dropped much less getting and sort of character arc. It's a good movie but it tries to focus on too many characters and it ends up focusing really on none, making most of them very forgettable."
" BAD MOVIE
",-0.5423,-0.6808,2021-01-09 00:00:00,3,This movie sucked in the only good scene was when Darth Vader killed them all
" A lack of meaningful characterization drags this film down
",-0.1779,0.9909,2021-01-09 00:00:00,6,"""Rogue One"" is a simple movie: A group of rebels have to fight against the Empire, and steal the Death Star plans in order to deliver a fatal blow to Vader's evil regime. You've heard about this in ""A New Hope,"" and in ""Rogue One,"" you get to see the group of rebels responsible for pulling off this daring act. But is it actually worth watching?""Rogue One"" in an interesting flick. The first hour of the film is relentlessly mediocre and forgettable, filled with practically zero interesting scenes except for one or two cool action sequences. The character building, except for Donnie Yen's character, is practically nonexistent, with almost zero substance being given to our main protagonist Jyn Erso, played by Felicity Jones. Truth be told, all of the characters in this movie are not very well fleshed out, and are pretty boring to watch, except for K-2SO, who is absolutely hilarious and entertaining every time he is on screen.That said, the movie moves along at a steady pace for its first hour, mostly because of how gorgeous it is to look at. The special effects are top notch, and are stunning to see. The movie looks so immaculate that you can almost forgive the boring first hour... almost.When the second hour comes into play, ""Rogue One"" picks up exponentially. The last act of the film is full of explosive action and riveting set pieces. ""Rogue One"" has been described as a war film set in space, and that's what it feels like. People engaged in combat play dirty and use guerilla tactics, and the violence feels more real than you'd expect in a science fiction film. The movie has a dark edge to it that sets it apart from other films in this franchise. However, because of the lack of meaningful characterization, I found it hard to care about what was happening, because frankly, I didn't care about any of the characters.Also, the movie ends with a very obvious scene of fan service, but it's fantastic fan service. The final few minutes of this movie are truly jaw dropping, and contain a scene so intense that you'll find yourself overwhelmed. I applaud them for including this scene in the film, but I couldn't help but feel like it was tacked on, as the film ends shortly after, and rather abruptly. However, the movie does end on a remarkably high note, which is always a plus.""Rogue One"" is a good Star Wars film, but it isn't great. It has a disappointing lack of characterization, and as such, is not very engaging throughout. However, if you want to see a cool action film set in the Star Wars universe, you can't go wrong with this."
" THE BEST Star Wars movie of all time
",0.3254,0.3561,2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie is better than all of the star wars movies before and after, because the plot is not black and white! All of the characters have different stands and are not as in previous movies only 100% pro or con the empire!
This leads to stronger characters struggling to achieve their goals.
All other aspects (like storyline, picture, CGI) of the movie are between 8 and 10 out of 10
I think it's a blessing, that there is no sequel, because most end up to be written worse than the original and pull down the original with it!"
" Highly recommendable, a lot of fan service...!
",0.3802,0.9909,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great and really enjoyable for those that like analyzing films, it has so many Easter-eggs and references that you'll need to watch it more than once.The cast is very diverse and has a lot of interesting characters, I personally love Diego Luna's character and K2SO is also very funny and sarcastic...! But so many main characters create a new issues, how do you develope them in 120 minutes? This movie wants to go into the internal problems of all the characters but it just doesn't make it well, Gareth Edwards tries to show us all the internal conflicts but he doesn't make it softly and subtly using Film techniques, he just throws to the viewer all this characters and his problems very fastly and also trying to create entertaining action scenes, it's really difficult. I think the plot is very well structured and it answers a very interesting question, how did the rebels got the charts of the Death Star...?The movie is really well directed, with a lot of action scenes and entertaining moments, you'll really fell Gareth Edwards is a real fan like us, he knows the Star Wars lore very well and throws you constantly very satisfying easter-eggs! The plot is entertaining and the resolution of the movie is dramatic but just SO EPIC! It's a very satisfying movie for the fans.In this movie we're also able to enjoy one of the greatest battles in the Star Wars saga, the battle in and above Scarif are just perfectly made and so complex...!
The villains are also charismatic and the ""conflict"" between Krennick and Tarkin is very ""funny"".
All the stuff with Jyn's father is very forced but I perfectly understand that's necessary for the correct development for the whole plot.
The ending with Darth Vader is also one of the most epic sequences in this wonderful saga and the direct ending with the start of ""A New Hope"" is so satisfying!The OST by Michael Giacchino is really nice and the cinematography is very cared.In conclusion, it's a very solid movie with a lot of epic and emotional moment that with a better character development could have been a lot better!"

" Rogue One: One of the Best Films Of The 2010 Decade
",0.6369,0.9592,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I am not a Sequel Trilogy hater. Heck, I would go far as saying that I might have the deepest connection with TLJ out of all the SW films. But no piece of Disney's Star Wars material had come close to the magic and absolutely exhilarating 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'.
I have had a very strange relationship with this films 1st viewing- I LOVED IT. 2nd Viewing- I NEARLY HATED IT. My opinion was always mixed about this film but as the years and year went on, there was always something about it that made me go back to it more so than any of the other Disney material.In 2020, I watched this film during quarantine. Nearly 4 years after its release. And the more and more I watch this movie the more it feels like a TRUE STAR WARS FILM and certainly one of the best films of the 2010s. From beginning to end, RO knows what it's doing as a movie. Ignore the behind the scenes drama, and enjoy the story presented to you and it WORKS.This is my 3rd favorite Star Wars film after Empire and A New Hope because it takes risks in a bold new direction and it succeeds! and I will never forget seeing this movie with my brother and dad and being super excited after the release of TFA for this film. Personally, this is my Star Wars. It's a self contained film that had everything I wanted as a fan and as a beginner filmmaker as well. I cannot recommend this movie enough"
" This is the best Star Wars ever
",0.1531,-0.6696,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"This is the best Star Wars movie ever. They should hire Gareth Edwards for the future Star Wars movie. Most of the Star Wars movies are so boring only this and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that I like. All scenes are superb, acting, drama, action, you name it."
" How They Brought The News From Aix To Ghent or Better Call Saw
",0.4404,-0.8791,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Star War buffs should be aware that this story of how the plans for the Death Star were put in the hands of the Rebel Alliance, stars Felicity Jones as the scrappy young heroine, with the usual pair of young men chastely lusting for her. It's nicely done and I started ticking off the stolen shots, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Hiroshima, Mon Amour that should please all us people who are so proud of having seen so many Great Movies (and many more crap ones). With Allen Tudyk as Marvin the Robot and Forest Whitaker as Nathan Bedford Amin, one can only admire the facility with which they plaster Peter Cushing's face on a living actor and duplicate his voice.However, what made this more than another interesting technological artifact detailing the doom of real actors (and, indeed, of SW canon, as I spotted a vehicle with WHEELS!) is the battle that makes up the second half of the picture. After the people in charge of the army decide not to go after the plans, a small group of people volunteer to steal a ship with Miss Jones, just going in and inevitably drawing the hotter-headed members of the Alliance as a small chance opens up. And since it is a very small chance and since no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, what happens when you're doing an Indiana Jones and making it up as you go along? The most messed up battle sequences since the opening of Saving Private Ryan."
" A blast from the past

Recently viewed it again and I was choked up. The deaths were moments and not shown in overblown ways. I appreciated that.

I also liked how we actually see the might of the empire in this movie because in the original trilogy we were told that the empire ruled with an iron fist but but never shown, while in rogue one we see the empire's might all across the galaxy."

Drop the first word and that's be correct - everything bad about modern films with awful directing, minimal development and anti white male rhetoric.I have no issues with a decent backstory or Disney per se but this typifies the corporate watering down to appear modern.The direction is awful documentary style. Why do this? It adds nothing and is a hackneyed way to add drama to cover up failings. Add in close ups and quick editing to make this whole thing is just irritatingly unwatchable. Then there is the caucasian male = bad; united nations or young = good.All just screams PC aimed at the youth market with no attention span, needing invented drama where it doesn't exist and showing how any ""minority"" is catered for.This was an abomination and was awful."

It really starts off the original trilogy off a great feeling that the Empire can be beaten.Also, I know C3PO's job was to be comic relief, but K2SO is funnier and much more realistic."

Yeah the first and second acts are a little slow to begin with. But it all pays off in the final act of this movie. Both the ground and space battles are phenomenal. Krenic's demise and betrayal at the hands of Tarkin is well played out. This movie adds so much to the original Star Wars, providing more context while wrapping up some ""plot holes"", while also standing alone as its own film. Cassias and K2SO stand out as exceptional characters and their rapport with each other is a stand out. I can't wait to see the Andor show, and hope we see how he meets and concerts K2 into an Ally of the Rebellion."

" Have they run out of American actors?
",0.0,0.8344,2020-12-26 00:00:00,2,"What is it with Hollywood and casting 80% of all roles now by foreign actors? I find the accents annoying and too distracting. I mean one here and there is fine, but 80% of the actors? Come on, man. Diego Luna was the worst one. Why does everything in the US get exported to foreign workers? I think I counted one American in there.That's just one problem. The second is the melodramatic acting from everyone. The concept and idea were good, but the execution was horrible. They needed a better director. I could literally spend hours writing the problems with this.There was not enough time spent between characters to build a meaningful relationship to care about. The hugging moment in the beginning between Jyn and her father is just not enough to care about them. They needed to spend 10 minutes or so developing that. In New Hope Luke spent substantial time with his adopted parents before they got killed so we cared. Also Jyn and Saw Gerrera was a throw-away relationship. It was pretty much build on a few exchanges of looks. Again, not enough to care when he faces his doom.This would be akin to cutting out all Luke's scenes with his parents in New Hope, except showing him leave saying goodbye and then returning to see their burned bodies. Luke and Ben Kenobi spent time together so by the time he met his fate we cared.This is due to lazy writing.Any why did they change the opening music? If you are making Star Wars, don't get rid of the main theme that identifies it. It makes no sense.So many things, like Darth Vader's dialogue didn't fit at all. Even Vader's costume didn't look like the real thing and his voice was off even though they appeared to have used Earl Jones.I mean, how many times do they have to use the phrase ""Hope""? Too on the nose with the references.They go from not believing what she says to believing within 5 minutes without any substantial reason.It's like they just kept the plot and cut out the heart of Star Wars. And it's NOT made up in silly dramatic speeches about their pasts. SHOW, don't TELL. Show us their struggles, don't talk about them.This is just over praised by fan boys. Too bad."

It's a play for Disney to make money. Every real Star Wars fan repressed this, sadly over time and thought. Sorry Disney, this just is not how it went."

There are some nonsense or exaggerated things but it is acceptable. And I still can't get why Disney keeps trying to introduce new things (in this movie in particular I'm talking about ships). A lot ones.
I guess that maybe this one is the best of the new Star Wars movies.Soundtrack: its good but there are some original musics modifications that can bother fans.Conclusion: even if you are a Star Wars fan this movie will not let you down like the other (in my humble opinion) Like I already said there are any errors. Maybe there will be some things that will bothers you, but I think that it worth it."

",0.7964,0.9871,2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"A scientist is forcibly recruited by the Empire to help build the Death Star.In my opinion Rogue One is (to date) the best Star Wars movie produced in the Disney era and one of the strongest entries in the overall franchise. I enjoyed it for its darker tone, excellent performances and in particular how well it fits into the overarching narrative of the Star Wars universe.There are a number of memorable scenes, particularly in the final act which packs a double emotional wallop with the fate of the main characters and what we know is to come in events portrayed in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.The action sequences and visuals are fantastic throughout, with a strong combination of great cinematography, sensible computer generated imagery and effective fight choreography. It's difficult to go into detail about the best bits without major spoilers so I'll just say they get the fan service spot on with a great blend of the old and the new.All performances are solid with Felicy Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk all compelling as the main antagonists. Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen give great support. The standout performances for me are Ben Mendelsohn as a memorable villain and Forrest Whitaker in a slightly unhinged cameo.Any fans of the original trilogy should enjoy this one, particularly when compared to the prequel and sequel movies which largely miss the mark."
" Lackluster movie again
",0.0,-0.9,2020-12-20 00:00:00,4,"So far the only thing Disney is getting good at it's making boring stories with uninteresting characters. I am seeing high reviews for this movie and I honestly don't understand. Disney is determined to just ignore the established history except when it suits them. The Bothans were responsible for stealing the Death Star plans. So why create an entire story that just changes that? If you want to make Star Wars on the name alone then advertise as not actually Star Wars. I just watched Episode VII, VII, and Rogue one. Everyone dies and it does not matter to me. I don't know anything about the characters. They show bits and pieces and tragedy and then expect you to develop an attachment based on 15 minutes of history. They keep bragging about this director and that director. They keep writing new stories. He is an idea. Watch the original trilogy and then make a Star Wars movie. Just because you can make a decent movie does not mean you can just make any movie decent. Do better."

The story is well told and stays within the bounds of what Star Wars is (unlike the other overly ambitious projects by disney). Only issues with the film is Forest Whitaker is pretty awful in this role, but other than him, the acting is top notch. The other issue is not exclusive to this Star Wars film, but what is the point of storm trooper armor?? They get beat up with sticks! I'm not understanding how they have hyperdrive tech, but their helmet tech can't protect them from sticks!? That said, I'm a pretty rough critic, and I can turn this in whenever I can't find something else. Good stuff."

" The Star Wars Spectacle
",-0.5574,-0.296,2020-12-05 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a science-fiction space opera movie set in the Star Wars universe. The movie takes place before Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The movie is about a rag-tag group that takes on the Empire to steal the plans for the Death Star. The movie is directed by Gareth Edwards and stars Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, and Donnie Yen.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the different Star Wars movie from the rest of the Star Wars movie catalog. The movie is a focused story on the Death Star plans. The movie frequently has cameos of villains in the chronologically later movies. Among these are Empire officer Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader. These cameos strangely take precedence over the story that Rogue One wants to tell. This is one of the detractions from the movie that prevents it from being able to stand alone.The action scenes are the best aspect of this movie. It is visceral in the minute details and epic in the scope. The effects and setup for these action scenes were the best in the entire Star Wars series. This movie had solid effects, solid action setup, solid choreography, and solid story to explain these action scenes. The audience truly feels the scale of the Rebellions battles against the Empire in this movie. Gareth Edwards does a great job with presenting the situations that the protagonists find themselves in.The fault with Rogue One is its plot and story. The plot and story are present here to provide the action scenes instead of the other way around. The action scenes are the driving force in this movie and plot and story are merely vehicles. This goes doubly so for the characters involved in this movie. There is simply not much to characterize them other than they want vengeance against the Empire. Each of the characters has different flavors of this vengeance, but ultimately they are all the same. One good aspect of this is that each of the characters do have distinctive traits about them. All of them are played decently as best they could have been. A distinction needs to be made for Forrest Whittaker's character of Saw Gerrera. The character felt like it should have been important, but was relegated to small roles in this movie. More fault is directed at the script rather than the actor as there was not much to work with.Despite the story problems, I would recommend 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'.Grade: C"
" Best of the Bunch
",0.6369,0.872,2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"I was almost thirty when I saw the first Star Wars movie. I've seen every one since; in a theater; some on opening day. I've stood in lines for hours that wrapped around the theater. I mention this so you know I've paid my dues. Of all eleven movies, this is the best of the bunch. It is a powerful story, well told, well acted. The plot line concerning dedication to,
and sacrifice for a cause greater than ones self resonates throughout time. If you nitpick details, you miss the bigger picture. This is one fine movie and the best of all the Star Wars stories."
" A Star Wars Movie
",-0.5574,0.9473,2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"This is what a Star Wars movie should and could be under Disney. Instead of creating unconvincing and uninteresting lore, they focused on the lore that already exists, of which there is so much. They did such a good job with this movie and it actually felt like on unlike the new Rey movies. Use the lore that the genius George Lucas made to make new movies and shows. Three movies on the Old Republic would have been so much better. Rogue One is a must watch for Star Wars fans that want and expect better from Disney. Excellent character development, plot, story, great characters and lore."
" Maybe Better Than Empire
",0.4404,0.915,2020-12-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie was so good, because it is dark and all the characters die. I like how its original and tells its own standalone story.That was all just a joke. Characters dying and beautiful shots don't make a good movie. I have to care about the characters, which I just can't. Each one is a bland paper cutout, especially the protagonist. The story is really just a vehicle for fan service (like Darth Vader killing a bunch of rebels, AT-AT Walkers)."
" A Good Story
",0.4404,0.9903,2020-11-30 00:00:00,8,"A good story that nicely ties into Episode IV. That, in fact, is the best part about the movie. It does a great job of providing background information of the new characters while at the same time making us interested in a story we, frankly, already know the ending to. The new characters are real and likable. I especially like the main character Jyn Erso. She is not bigger than life and still manages to capture your attention.Now for the not so good parts. This movie would have been a whole lot better had they kept the classic iconic character involvement to a minimum. First the CGI on Tarkin and Leia is obvious. I understand why they did it but the technology simply is not ready to make characters who can endure long on camera balanced against live action. It would have been much better to keep this to a minimum or find some way around it. Truthfully, Tarkin simply was not necessary. He could have been replaced by any number of characters acting on his behalf. (Though whoever did the voice nailed it). The brief scene with Leia could have been done completely from behind. We did not need to see her face.The scene with Vader and the director was also unnecessary. It would have been better if Vader's dialogue had been up to par but it was not. He is not a long winded character and never needed to be. To be blunt, he talked too much. Also he did not look right. I cannot explain it any better than that but he seemed off somehow.A good movie overall and well worth eight out of ten stars. Better by far than most of the prequel movies."
" Really good!
",0.54,0.9552,2020-11-28 00:00:00,8,I thought before watching it that it was going to be a silly cashgrab but it is not actually the case.

Really satisfied with this one. Hope further movies go in this direction.
" Nice
",0.4215,0.9782,2020-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Another example where the trailer is better than the movie. ""Rogue One"" relies on established movie names, such as Mads Mikkelsen and Forest Whitaker to sell their fish. Watching the movie, disappointment takes over. The aforementioned actors pass away from a good performance and are only there as supporting luxury. Who has a lot of participation, does not show a good service. It is the case of Felicity Jones. This actress has a serious problem, she cannot convey any feeling to the audience that watches her. His partner in the lead Diego Luna is really a perfect match for Felicity. The actor also can't express what his character demands. I think the biggest fault of all this is the director Gareth Edwards. Here the director has one of the biggest responsibilities of his career. Here we are not talking about ""Godzilla"", which was a remake, that is, if he did a bad job there, nobody would even call, it was a job that was going to pass But here it demands much more. And so, as in ""Godzilla"", the director leaves the best for the final part. Better action sequences are presented in a sensational way right there at the end. Something we didn't see in the beginning and a half of the And contrary to what they said, Donnie Yen has very few action scenes, well executed, but very fast. I mention three important points, which worked well in the plot. First: The soundtrack. It is a separate show. In each scene, we have new sounds, something that impresses. Everything perfectly synchronized with the scenes. Second: The effects. fill the eyes. The battles between ships is to leave anyone jaw-dropping. The colors that are used are very vivid, and that further enhances the experience on the big screen. A film to be seen in the cinema. Third: Darth Vader.Film seen on the 22nd to the 23rd of November 2020."

The surprise of the return of certain characters is also a delight to see. This film is just so well written and I think Disney can learn another from it in way not everything needs to be so family friendly sometime you just need to give the fans what they want. The action is also superb in this film the battle scenes just pump the adrenaline up from what rubbish Disney have put in the new trilogy I can't understand how they went from this to that. I give this film a well deserved 10 as I loved every second of it and its just worth it for the final 5 minutes that is something fans have wanted for a very very long time and yes the hype is real.

Several decades later, the genius that is Gareth Edwards came up with and made the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy.

They appear little surprised after a world is distructed and then think about their individual problems again. It is very hard to predict what they will say as they can suddenly change their thoughts. Like the guy on the planet (that's being destroyed) who in fact decides to die just because.The CGI is amazing except for Tarkin who feels like an angry doll. He's evil, concentrated in a doll. Not really human anymore as the real Tarkin was in the previous movies. Darth Vader feels like the most stable character and again chokes his subordinate when he feels like it, the same way as we've seen in other movies. And uses his typical cute hand gesture. This is the most cruel type of violence, because the people who die in this movie feel like computers simply shut off (because there's very little connection
with the dying character and when he lies on the floor, looks like he could jump back to life if he wanted to).For me the movie was utterly boring."

",-0.3182,0.9543,2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"""Rogue One"" is pretty average. With a few years of retrospective, and the Disney-produced sequel trilogy behind us, I've decided to review all of the ""Star Wars"" movies. ""Rogue One"" used to rank a lot higher on my personal list, but this most recent viewing has definitely made me reconsider the franchise as a whole.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is an Imperial prisoner who is freed by the Rebellion. They want to track down Jyn's father, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who is an engineer working on the Death Star, a planet-killing super weapon. The Rebellion is looking for the specifications to the space station so that they might find a weakness and exploit it. Jyn is accompanied by Rebel spy Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his droid sidekick, K-2SO (Alan Tudyk). Together, the travel to the desert moon of Jedha to find Jyn's caretaker and guardian Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), who is also a friend of Galen's and will help them find him.All of the most recent movies are just so bland. There's no soul in the Disney ""Star Wars"" films. They're all filled to the brim with cringeworthy humor and numerous callbacks to things that you liked about the original trilogy. Which gets really stale and boring after five films. The initial luster of ""Rogue One"" and it's cool Darth Vader finale have definitely worn off. Maybe this could be seen as a critique of big franchise blockbuster movies in general. None of these movies are made to tell interesting stories or take any sort of risks. ""Rogue One"" is probably the most redundant movie in the entire series. Did we really need to learn how the Death Star plans were procured by the Rebellion?I guess you could say the exact same thing about ""Solo"", which I gave a much more glowing review of. But that movie at least had a fun western aesthetic to it. Woody Harrelson and Donald Glover were also both really good. ""Rogue One"" has nothing. This movie gets a 7 simply because I do like a lot of the action scenes set on Scarif. But the callbacks, ranging from the cantina guy from the original movie to the awful CGI effects used to bring the dead back to life (Tarkin and Leia) just really take me out of the movie. And none of these new characters carry any of the charisma that Luke Skywalker and Han Solo brought us on their adventures.This movie's pretty mediocre. ""Star Wars"" fans will really like it, but I don't recommend it as a necessary watch to any sort of casual fan, and certainly not for anyone brand new to the franchise. You'd want to watch the entire original trilogy first and also maybe the prequel trilogy as well."

" I don't see what's so fun about this.
",0.6418,0.9886,2020-09-03 00:00:00,1,"There is no element of attachment to the protagonist. A movie needs an element that makes the viewer feel for the protagonist. In this movie, there is an element of sympathy for the protagonist, but that's not enough to keep the movie alive. The main character's passion to do something about it must be conveyed. You can't feel the protagonist's enthusiasm to do something. If the story goes on like that for more than 30 minutes, it's boring to watch. If the protagonist discovering his purpose and feeling passionate about his work later, there needs good methods. For example, you could show another person's enthusiasm and then use that person's charm to attract viewers. Or you should make the audience feel why the protagonist has no intention to the problems despite his potential. If there is such a thing, the audience can get into the movie. However, Ando is just a plain character in this film and there is no explanation of his motivation or enthusiasm. The scriptwriter assumes that the story is so well and the audience will understand the gravity of the situation. In addition, each episode is not interesting. No, the episodes don't even seem to be there. It seems to me that the story is just going along in a bland manner. I call this kind of story ""the story of a timeline"". They're trying to make a blind character look cool, but no action is going to do any good when the story isn't thriving. All I could see was him striking out all over the place."
" A surprisingly really great spin-off story
",0.7645,0.9882,2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"I was a bit skeptical in the beginning as the movie was moving very fast, moving from planet to planet and character to character too quickly with little information on what's going on but the movie really improves from there.The movie does a great job of recreating the time when the Empire was in control with all the stormtroopers and overall tone and look. It really takes us back to the time of the original trilogy. This movie also has a very clear plot and does its job of explaining how the rebels got the death star plans. It had a clear direction and tone that was filled with incredible action, emotional stakes and suspense.This movie also has one of the greatest final battles in Star Wars behind ROTS. The combined use of practical effects and CGI was really well done and looks magnificent and the action is exciting, fast-paced but easy to follow and had a lot of suspense and the victory feels well-earned and satisfying.This movie also makes a great risk of killing off its characters in the end, making the victory in ROTJ feel more earning and heartfelt and it provides some very emotional moments.I do think the characters could have been a bit more interesting and have more defining personalities and the pacing was slow at times and the movie could have gotten its runtime cut down by around 10 minutes but all in all, it's a great spin-off Star Wars story that I'd highly recommend to Star Wars fans and non-fans."

",0.0,-0.9589,2020-08-21 00:00:00,6,"What a hodge-podge of characters, plot devices, special effects, and settings. To understand any of what's happening you have to have seen the sequel, ""Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope"" (1977) and then you at least can say ""I know where this is heading."" However, having seen Episode IV you already know that the plans for the Death Star were successfully smuggled out of the Empire's fortress and sent on their way via Princess Leia to Rebel headquarters. The only mystery is how our new cast of ""Dirty Dozen"" heroes accomplishes the feat and how much destruction and death ensue in the process. Several observations: (1) The Stormtroopers were just as lousy at shooting here as they were (will be?) in ""A New Hope."" (2) Our heroes have apparently learned how to use today's way of advancing with a weapon i.e. arms holding the gun fully extended forward. Down the road, on the Death Star, Han Solo and Co. apparently will forget this technique completely. (3) Like all the Star Wars movies, the names of the characters seem to be drawn at random from spilled Scrabble board pieces. (4) Using posthumously CGI of Peter Cushing as bad guy Wilhuff Tarkin can only be described as creepy (and maybe a new Academy Award category?)."

2) Despite its epic art direction, it's a relatively easy watch with a lot of comedy
3) A group of unlikely heroes getting thrown into the deepest and most profound plot elements of the star wars universe, where they embark on an extraordinary journey that actually adds to the bigger picture and can be slotted in before watching ""a new hope"" as part of the full set of star wars filmsA must-see really if you're into sci-fi in general and star wars specifically."

" No fanboy footnote, but a bold blockbuster in its own right.
",0.8462,0.9894,2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"With Rogue One Edwards has achieved a masterful balancing act; he's stayed faithful enough to the ethos of the original Star Wars universe to appease the fans, whilst bringing a unique, darker, sinister and more adult edge to his film which appeals to a newer audiences. Quite a big ask, but he's more or less succeeded. The action is great, SFX outstanding, the plot easy enough to follow for the non-initiated without being inconsequential and there's some great comic relief from a new sarcastic robot side-kick. Sounds a similar formula. However the menace of the empire seems less comic book here. The stakes more real. The consequences more serious. Perhaps it's deliberately more allegorical considering the times we now live in. Or maybe it's simply a braver film than George Lucas would have made. Whilst it is a fine addition to the Star Wars canon, Rogue One isn't merely the fanboy footnote it could have been, but a bold blockbuster standing on its own merits."

There are shootouts, explosions, huge ships ramming into each other, hand to hand combat, and more. There are also thrilling space battles and heists. This movie delivers!It is also the funniest Star Wars film to date. This is mostly due to K2S0, who totally helps make this film. The other characters have some humorous lines, but K2S0 delivers the best ones.The only reason this film does not get 10/10 is because the movie score is no where near the quality of John Williams. There are still some catchy themes though.Overall, this is a thrilling and entertaining edition to the Star Wars saga, and indicates that the future of the franchise would benefit more by veering away from the mainstream Skywalker saga."

paper thin characters... Although there was potential - main protagonist Jyn is as interesting as grey toiler paper. Supporting characters are weak. it tell you something when robot is more interesting than anybody elsestory is boring, predictable (yes you can have good story even if you know the outcome!), brings no emotional engagement at all.manipulation. Characters and story are weak...what to do, what to do?! Of course bring fan service and hope that it will take away their attention from bad movie. It seems it worked.All of those things made me not care at all about what happens with the characters. Which makes their last stand even more comical.

All the actors do have a vital role to play in the movie. No one is put in the story just to fill out any gabs. Everyone brings something important to the story. Even the bad guys are a great pleasure to watch as you have a very good understading of why they do what they do.

Disney as usual wants to monetize on their big investment buying Lucasfilms and produced this one in 2016. I think they did a good job preserving lots of the well known classic Star Wars elements. Even CGI Peter Cushing and a young CGI Carrie Fisher doesn't hurt this flick though the overall feel of the post George Lucas productions seems different than from the original classic trilogy.

Great ground battle footage. It felt believable. I didn't like most characters at the beginning but by the end found myself mourning along side them.

It opened up for such a powerful story of self sacrifice and giving outside of yourself. Jyn's mother and father, Saw Gerrera and ultimately the whole of Scarif and their sacrifice for something that may not even reach its destination. All this was done without any Jedi's or distracting ship battles, instead it was a beautiful story told within a Star Wars world.Great movie and on a much better path to where Star Wars should be than the latest trilogy"

" Truly a Great Movie!!! Beautiful.
",0.9149,0.9995,2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"The Greatest Star Wars Movie since the Originals, not even to throw any shade at the PT or ST or even Solo, but this movie is just Great.
There is great characters, it is really inspiring, and it provides context and makes A New Hope better.
This movie was released 4 years ago on my birthday. I waited a few days to see it, but loved it ever since then. It took me a few years to re-watch it, but it is just as good every time. With my interest sparked in Star Wars books, the books of Thrawn and Catalyst (The prequel book to the movie) have given even more context and made the movie better. Though it was not lacking in providing the relationships and backstory of the characters. I do not think the movie is dependent on extra material other than the movie.
Jyn Erso is the main character of this story, and grows more than any of the other characters through out the story. We meet her and she is lost she has no love for the empire, but also no real love for anyone. She is just an average criminal, but this story reunites her to face her past and she seizes the moment with an act of heroism. I think that the change happens a little too fast, but is still great. Both her and Cassian have to win you over, and by the end I cared, the first time and still today. She makes the greatest most powerful speech of the movie and another. This is the moment when she truly wins over the audience, and shows the faults of the Rebellion at the same time. Many of the are cowards and are not willing to fight and die to bring down the Empire. But Jyn is the Hero and is not afraid, (Given she is motivated by her father's death), and tells them that they should not run and hide while they ""become like the ashes of Jehda"".
Cassian Andor is a rebel. Is true to the cause he believes in, but has crossed the line of what he though was right in the process. They establish his moral grayness when he kills the man at in his first scene, it was not without reason, but many other better men would have tried to save him. By the end he realized that doing what you believe is right is more important than following orders. After Jyn's speech though he already believed her he set out to make it right and gathers men to fight along side Jyn.
K2SO is awesome. He is hilarious and gives the movie heart. ""Don't resist you are being rescued"" ""I thought it was boring and you were in trouble""
Chirrut Îmwe and his side kick Baze Malbus are great. Chirrut is a man of faith and it guides him to be fearless and plays an important role in their success. Baze upon Chirrut's death takes up is faith and fights until he can't no more. ""I am one with the force the force is with me"".
Orson Krennic, the villain of the story, is a man searching for power and wants credit, but with all the stuff he gain he failed and Tarkin took credit and killed him with his own weapon.
The action and the effects are great. The final act with the infiltration and eventual battle at Scarif is truly awesome. It is inspiring. They keep taking chances. They almost get lucky, but it is because their is drive, passion, and the will to fight to their last breathe.
The mission was a suicide mission, non of the characters expected to come back, neither did the audience, but that does not cheapen their deaths one bit. (They were sacrifices for the greater good the we have see unfold 40 years ago when people first saw Star Wars.
The premise was great, the wrote the story from a line in the crawl of A New Hope, and made it great.
Also Darth Vader was in the movie for just enough time, and the hallway scene is spot on and One of the greatest Darth Vader moments Ever. C-3PO and R2-D2 have a great cameo.
It still is not the OT, but it is so close to it. Really the worst thing is that CGI Leia and Tarkin. I think what holds it back from being one of my favorite movies ever is just that these are characters we only get to know from this movie, where the characters from the Episodic films are legendary in our world and the galaxy far far away. Though the characters are likable and they are heroes and their deaths are impact, and the movie leads so well into the originals I wanted to go home and watch A New Hope right then.
I am glad that this movie is highly regarded even in an era of hating Star Wars, it truly deserves it. With all the negativity in the Fandom, it is heart warming when people agree that something is awesome."

Sadly, i was dissapointed like everybody else.... the last two were almost painful for me.
Episode VII had some attributes, but the one picture who did capture THE spirit, essence and joy of the saga, is Rogue One.
A lot can be said from this movie, but i would like to assure you this: you won't be dissapointed."
" Unremarkable action-laden sci-fi adventure, which does little but bridge a gap.
",0.1655,-0.9989,2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"Well, at least we now know how THAT happened... I'm not sure what it means when all you can illicit after a film like ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" has come to its crashing, thrashing, resounding finale, is a shrug - a frown and a meekly appreciative nod of the head at how far special effects have come along, but it can't be good. Look, I don't necessarily dislike ""Star Wars""; I just came to it too late on in life to be able to adore it. But is a film which bridges the gap between the events of the first trilogy and the second of the famous filmic brand really what the die-hards wanted? If what transpires therein ""Rogue One"" was any other science-fiction war drama, would we really be all that interested?It strikes me that the mind behind Star Wars, George Lucas, did neither himself nor the name of Star Wars many favours when he decided to sell it on to the Disney corporation, a brand name more synonymous with child's films, or at the very least entertainment for children. That is not to say that all of Disney's output has necessarily been made for the youngest among us, but there is something inherently childish about ""Rogue One"" - it is a film for people who like noise and colour; its nucleus of heroes battling villains (toward an outcome we already know) is strikingly simplistic. By the end, I was struck by just how uncomplicated it all was.Gareth Edwards' effort here is, as stated, the conduit connecting the first three episodes to the latter three - that seemingly dead filmic space between the coming of Darth Vader and the evil empire he seeks to use to command the galaxy, and the plans of a weapon of mass destruction being stolen from one of said empire's bases. I cannot say that said dead-space, never mind the events that transpired therein, especially captured my imagination having actually seen all six episodes, but I cannot speak for other people - one assumes they are not the same as those who were desperate to learn about what Hans Solo was like as a younger smuggler, or what the origin-story of Vader himself was.Principally, there is a thematic in ""Rogue One"" somewhere about morality and good vs. evil. It is epitomised in two characters whom both work for Vader's Empire: Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a technician who has first developed the Death Star and then gone on to develop second thoughts, and Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic, who works with Vader and is very much in love with the idea of a WMD. Anyone who has seen Mendelsohn's work in other films, particularly his native Australian ones, will know that he is probably one of the best actors working today, but is wasted here in being asked to snarl into the camera and pull exasperated expressions. Galen should be, and I suspect probably was in an earlier draft, the film's protagonist with Krennic the principal villain. This, I would surmise, was changed at some point to encompass Felicity Jones, who plays Mikkelsen's daughter Jyn Erso, as the lead - a move which was probably supposed to have an eye on feminism or diversity or something, but actually hurts the project.As ""Rogue One"" rolls on, you can see what the initial, more interesting film, might have resembled: two men working for the same organisation seeing things from different sides; both working to thwart the other and building to a climax whereby these ideas blossom into a tense finale atop a skywalk, as all-out war unfolds around them. This is not the film we are presented with, but we get something instead with enough going on to engage us - the being taken to new worlds; the thrill of a pursuit; the quirky supporting acts which bump us along the road - commendation is in order for Edwards for refusing to pepper the opening acts with differing robots; aliens and other idiosyncratic creatures for sake of selling them on the shelves of toy stores.Jones, as a young girl, is hiding on her parents' farm when Krennic comes calling for her father so that he may finish the Death Star. His refusal causes a tiff, a tiff from which Jones escapes into the world of underground resistance led by the eccentric Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), whose mob is far from wholesome, and we appreciate how the film is trying to paint good in characters associated with the dark and bad in those synonymous with the alliance. Again, these ideas seem left over from a different, better, project and eventually come to nothing. Eventually, Jones takes it on to seek the Death Star's weak spot her father purposely created by way of the plans hidden in the depths of an enemy base. Tossed into the mix is a defecting Empirical fighter-pilot played by Riz Ahmed, which is an interesting idea, but we had seen this line of attack executed more efficiently the previous year with the John Boyega character in ""Force Awakens"".For almost its entire runtime, ""Rogue One"" consists of hits and misses until its head-banging climax: the Death Star, when we see it, and despite knowing exactly what it's capable of, still manages to awe us when it gets going, which is good. One particular character, an ally, is a blind Chinaman whose forté is that he is good at marital arts and spouts Eastern philosophical tidbits, which is bad. Ultimately, Rogue One is an expensive diversion; a project Lucas probably wishes he himself had thought of when he had the rights to this pandemonium; an answer to that annoying question fans and whoever else like to ask pertaining to the Death Star's weak spot and how someone could be so stupid as to put it there in the first place. Well, after much thrashing about, that has now been buried. Congratulations..."
" Respect for Rogue one
",0.4767,0.743,2020-05-21 00:00:00,10,"One of the best star wars movie. Rogue one they are so underrated and unsung heroes of star wars. Jyn Erso is everything Rey wants to be, a real badass. Thank u for this masterpiece."
" A true war film, meticulously planned film for Star Wars fans, who will have the chance to vibrate with the battles and Imperial Ships, as well as connections with A New Hope.
",-0.3182,-0.629,2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"At the same time that Disney started a new trilogy with the main saga in ""The Awakening of the Force"", it also decided to invest in parallel stories that take place in the same universe of Star Wars, and may even collide directly with some of the main stories seen in the series until today. ""Rogue One"" is part of and is the first in a new series of spin-offs produced by Walt Disney and its narrative is established between the events of ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope"", beginning thirteen years before the explosion of the first Death Star. Six years had passed since the extinction of the Order of the Jedi Knights, the disappearance of the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker, the appearance of the cruel Sith Lord Darth Vader as well as the fact that Emperor Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic into the fearsome Galactic Empire. In a few minutes, the story moves forward and runs almost simultaneously with the events of ""A New Hope"".In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) was estranged from her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), as a child, due to director Krennic's (Ben Mendelsohn) requirement that he works on building the most powerful weapon in the Empire, the Death Star. Created by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), she had to learn to survive on her own when she turned 16. As an adult, Jyn is rescued from prison by the Rebel Alliance, who wants access to a message sent by her father to Gerrera. With the promise of freedom at the end of the mission, she agrees to work alongside Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and the K-2SO robot.The idea of the film was born from a detail present in the classic ""Star Wars"" of 1977: in the initial signs, it was said that the plans of the Death Star had been stolen by Rogue One, allowing the Rebel Alliance to have new hope. Who they were, none of the films released responded ... until now. Director Gareth Edwards brings many of the much loved elements of the universe created by George Lucas. We see different types of beings (many of them are created only with the intelligent use of makeup and prostheses and when there is a fusion of digital effects, they work in a transparent way), robots with their own personality that offer a certain dose of humor and the duality of good against evil encouraged by idealistic issues. ""Rogue One"" brings a heavier climate inherent to the growing threat posed by the Empire, on the eve of inaugurating its most powerful weapon, the Death Star. However, more than just appropriating revisited icons, the script is concerned with bringing new contexts.Of course, watching Rogue One knowing the original trilogy allows for another layer of appreciation, but in a well-written script sign, no reference to the universe already known to fans is intrusive or in any way disrupts the narrative, something that is a real relief to the world we live in today, where scripts are practically written around references. And the best part of this observation is that Rogue One, if we stop to think, is nothing more than an immense unique reference, but that, so well-structured and developed, works independently. In addition, the Force approach in this film is also quite different from what we are used to. The plot shows the various levels of belief in this almost magical power that is able to influence that universe in different ways and how it can motivate, or not, someone on their journey.Gareth Edwards delivers a true war film, a mission with little chance of succeeding, with constant losses, battles on the ground and also in the stars, defeats and moral conflicts that add much more colors to those who are considered the heroes. The characters in ""Rogue One"" are excellent and assume with all the lyrics that they have already made damn moral and ethical decisions, but assume as part of who they have become and what they are willing to do in the name of a cause. There are good bows for Cassian Andor, a son of war who puts Rebel interests above all else, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), remnants of times when the Force and the Jedi were not just legends, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), the Empire's deserter looking for redemption, and even K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), the sincere reprogrammed droid. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who should unite them all, seems to be forgotten. Felicity Jones is a charismatic actress and quickly manages to overcome her character's conflicts, especially in her broken relationship with her father and how she has a chance to fulfill her greatest desire. Presenting weaknesses, the protagonist is also extremely courageous. On the other hand, Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera also brings new nuances by presenting an extremist rebel, something hitherto little explored within the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, an actor of the Whitaker level is used to put the plot in motion, only, not having a relevant role in the next acts of the plot.Only two digital appearances are a little uncomfortable for the experience: Tarkin and Princess Leia. Tarkin was played by Peter Cushing in ""A New Hope"". With the death of the actor, the appraisal of Tarkin - extremely necessary so that Rogue One could be ""fitted"" in the mythology already established since the villain was the one who would destroy Alderaan - was all digitally inserted with the result falling short of the expected. The same can be said about Princess Leia, even though her face is seen for only three seconds and at the end of the projection, the moment is a shock to the viewer. And the worst thing is that, unlike Tarkin, his presence was unnecessary to the plot. Your presence from the front, I say. It was enough to have seen the heroine from the back for the whole message to be passed on.There are excellent action sequences, such as the scenes on the planet Jedha, at the Imperial research facilities and especially on the planet Scarif, where the group of protagonists invades the database and obtain plans that show the vulnerability in the newly built Death Star. The work of the photographer Greig Fraser helps in his composition of the different planets that we travel through the projection. From a green planet in the prelude to a commercial warehouse crowded with people in an asteroid belt, passing through a semi-desert planet, another with rocks and torrential rains, culminating in a Caribbean paradise, we see their work completely change and adapt to the demands of narrative. General plans are contrasted with medium and American plans used to work on the threat tone and the proportion of the military power of the Empire with the small Rebel Alliance.""Rogue One"" does not fail to explore elements and characters well known to fans. Darth Vader's few appearances are always striking, there are several comic situations involving stormtroopers in order to give them some personality and even the Death Star appears imposing, allowing the viewer to follow the damage caused by its destructive ray from the planet itself achieved - something also unprecedented in the series, as well as the combat carried out in the midst of a paradisiacal scenario. The soundtrack, written by Michael Giacchino, wisely uses excerpts from the iconic compositions made by John Williams.With more action and battle scenes than any of its seven predecessors, ""Rogue One"" serves as a prep for the events of the original 1977 film. It combines nostalgia and ingenuity to fill gaps in the canon and reveal other sides of the galaxy, with soundtrack, characters, creatures, vehicles and new, but familiar planets. While the good guys get more nuanced, the Empire's attacks become more brutal. The destruction is seen much more closely than has already been portrayed, and surprisingly it is more beautiful precisely because of this more personal view. It is not something that is happening only in a galaxy so, so distant, it is something that affects places that have just been visited, that you knew the routine and some of its inhabitants. But what makes it especially special is how it fits perfectly into the Star Wars timeline and connects events we already know by heart with others we've never considered. It makes us question how many other untold stories are in the dark corners of the galaxy far removed from George Lucas. With an electrifying ending, we see exactly how valuable a film derived from Star Wars is. He can walk on his own legs, he doesn't have to worry about leaving countless details prepared for what comes next and he can surprise the audience as it hasn't been seen in the franchise in a long time. It is a meticulously planned film for Star Wars fans, who will have the chance to vibrate with the battles fought by X-Wings and Imperial Ships, as well as connections with A New Hope. There is a clear respect for Gareth Edwards and his team to what the original trilogy represents, not only as a story, but as an ambience, in the sense of delivering something consistent with what has already been produced without sticking to a mere revisit."
" Worse upon second viewing
",-0.4767,0.7934,2020-05-20 00:00:00,7,"POSITIVES:1) The entire third act is almost flawless
2) Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn give the best performances in the film, they're great
3) I like the darkness of Cassian being introduced by shooting his informant in the back
4) THAT Vader scene: WOWNEGATIVES:1) I hated pretty much everything about the first act, for example how it hops from planet to planet and introduces each planet with generic text on screen like ""imperial mining base""
2) The second act could be taken out almost entirely to shorten the runtime, everything on Edu is irrelevant to the story
3) Forest Whittaker's line delivery reminded me of Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas, and I never believed that he was the same character as the guy from The Clone Wars
4) The dialogue can be very cringeworthy, especially the constant mentions of 'hope'
5) I didn't mind CGI Tarkin, but CGI Leia was terrible
6) What on Earth was the deal with that mind reading giant squid thing?!?! And why does Saw say it'll make the pilot lose his mind but then he's fine pretty much straight away???"
" Fantastic
",0.5574,-0.9607,2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic movie with a sad ending, I loved the whole concept of this film and after the full Star Wars franchise this is still my favourite of the whole series, it has a feel to the original unlike most of the sequels. The characters you feel their emotions and you feel attachment, with their choices and their actions. The ending was a real hit because the almost all the main protagonists die in a sad and horrible scene. It really hit when Jyn and Cassian are sitting together as the whole planet is being exploded it's horrible and sad. The movie shows you what the people that worked for the Rebels and there story on how they helped the main protagonist in the main movies, win the war. I liked this and how it showed a whole different side. The movie itself is really good and a must watch and explains how Princess Laila and the Rebels get the plans to the Death Star and to be honest at the end what they did seem pointless at they sat there waiting to be murdered by the Death Star. A MUST WATCH."
" The best of the lacklustre Disney projects
",0.6369,0.7257,2020-05-17 00:00:00,6,"I for one am completely underwhelmed with Disney Star Wars, they lack everything that made the original trilogy so great! However Rouge One is the best of what's come out of the House of Mouse since 2015 and I'll leave it at that."
" Hope
",0.4404,0.9221,2020-05-16 00:00:00,9,"Yay, an original story finally this is the best of the Disney era Star Wars films and I loved how this tied into the 1st (4th) movie perfectly with Princess Leia's ""hope"". Story is solid and follows a ragtag band of freedom fighters including a former soldier turned prisoner, a rebel alliance insider and a blind Jedi who work together to steal the Death Stars blueprints -and, according to the battle briefing in Star Wars we all know how well that worked out for them. Anyways this was super good, what I'd been hoping for all along with these new movies. No real review here just random thoughts.Fun references to original trilogy throughout, the guy with the face from the bar on Tatooine that bumps into people and picks fights apparently as a hobby, Leia's father Jimmy Smits -had to wrap my brain around the timeline for his character appearance, loved the blind Jedi Samurai dude, the battle on the beach is very Pacific WW2 feeling, Darth Vader's castle and him in the healing bath, cool but they should have shown his missing limbs, the longer I'm watching and the more I get attached to the characters the worse I feel for their inevitable outcome, Diego Luna and Felicity Jones are now in a scene reminiscent of Tea Leoni & her dad in Deep Impact, Vader kicking ass at the end is awesome how I always felt he should be, powerful and super angry, blew my mind a bit actually but he says too much, Vader is better with less James Earl Jones, the ending is 10 stars, Hope line with CGI'd Carrie Fisher, sigh."

I went to see it in theaters and couldn't believe how amazing it was! The characters were awesome and really cool, the story was so original, more original than I imagined, great script, and the whole plot just fits perfectly into the original trilogy. Felicity Jones was perfect, Diego Luna did a great job with his character, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, Forrest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn and Mads Mikkelsen are fantastic characters. I enjoyed it so much, this one of star wars best films ever and why? Because it is not dependent on the original story. It may be a spin off but it is great as it is."
" Probably the best of star wars movie outside the clones wars and empire strikes back
",-0.6705,0.9937,2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"This captures everything star wars should be a star war it has a cast of well acted and good but flawed characters who are put up against a superior force and pull off the impossible but unlike the original trilogy it doesn't end well for our heroes which is a great twist on the normal formula where you expect all the good guys to live.
On to the truly great bits the action scenes fast paced and incredible visuals and sound make them very effective unlike a lot in the sequels and prequels and even some in the original trilogy they have a lot of weight to them you feel the harshness of the rebel struggle like in the battle of both, also a rebel ship Rams a star destroy into another one and Darth Vader cuts up a bunch of rebels at the end it's absolutely class.
There are notable bad parts like the underuse of Mads Mikkleson or Forest Whitaker and the weird grand moff tarkin CGI also Diego Luna is a bit bland in it compared to Donnie Yen and Felicity Jones Eve Alan Tudyk as the cool Droid does a damn sight better job than him the pilot guy I can't remember his name is also good got some fun lines nothing to special, overall great acting brings a lot to the star wars brand more than the sequels and prequels do it's no clone wars but it's probably better than return of the Jedi definitely worth watching even if you don't like star wars it doesn't rely on nostalgia to be good like force awakens clearly does."
" Best Star Wars movie
",0.1531,0.9779,2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised to see the rating of this movie is not as good as the original trilogy, let alone The Force Awakens. This movie This one fits perfectly between Episode III and IV and fills at least one major plot hole in the latter. This movie introduces lovable characters which I would've loved to explore more and this all happens without any forced cringeworthy love interests (looking at you casual incest and Episode IX). Yes it does benefit
a little from the nostalgia bonus but not far as much as the original trilogy and the sequels do, despite including some original characters. Including those is a necessity for continuity and it isn't what makes this movie great.
The story revolves around Jyn Erso and the tragedy of her family, the conflict between that, the empire, the rebels and the blueprints of the Death Star. Eventually they are lead to Scarif, which is the final destination of our main characters who are once not (as heavily and obviously) guarded by plot armor. The atmosphere created in this whole segment is simply mesmerizing (not only limited to Scarif) with great visuals and the characters sacrificing themselves one by one for the greater cause. When recognizing the rebels' plans, the empire has the great solution to simply destroy the whole planet literally firing all hard working people without notice. They were successful at that but so were Jyn and Cassian, managing to finish the necessary deed before. As the Death Star's ray hit the planet, they were down by the seaside. Knowing that this is the end, they just hugged (not kissed (!)) one last time as the light eventually swallowed them. This was a tragically beautiful end for the remaining characters of this story (while not overdoing it) and what happens next simply serves as a direct transition to Episode IV."

" It was ""meh""
",0.0,-0.9696,2020-04-10 00:00:00,5,"While enjoyable for a movie, it falls way short of Star Wars standards. To be blunt, the movie was a pointless cash-grab. First, it was hard to even get invested in the characters, as it was obvious that none of them would survive since none were in any of the other movies. But perhaps the biggest issue the movie has is that it literally revolves around addressing a so-called plot-hole of A New Hope (something that isn't actually a plot hole if you think about it.)So, yeah, we all know about the Death Star flaw in A New Hope. Shoot a rocket down a shaft until it reaches the core and the whole station goes boom. This is the apparent issue that so many people had a problem with that they even going so far as to call it a plot hole. Apparently, it was such a big deal that Disney made an entire movie centering around it, but to me, it was never a problem. The flaw, while having big consequences, was so small and so outlandishly impossible to use against the Death Star that it took a space wizard to pull it off. Think about it, a single exhaust port only two meters wide required a small ship to fly down a trench full of guns to fire a torpedo in such a way that it makes a perfect 90% angle at the exact right moment and then travel down a thin shaft in a perfectly straight line, all while a moon sized battle station is expelling gas and exhaust, which should have pushed the torpedoes out if anything, or at least disrupt their straight line course. This movie makes it so this design flaw was intentionally built into the system, but that's far from believable. The shot was literally impossible to pull off unless you were a Jedi, which makes the whole idea that the flaw was actually an intentional trap built into it completely ridiculous and even more outlandish. That's not a trap, it's bait to a slaughter. This just made the whole plot of Rogue One completely stupid and pointless to me.However, this movie did give us that awesome Vader hallway scene. That alone made this entire movie worthwhile, even though it was a complete cash grab. Although that scene does now make the whole fight between Vader and Obi-Wan in A New hope seem that much sillier in comparison. I know this movie has gotten a lot of praise, but other than the Vader hallway scene, it was completely unnecessary, and I almost wish it didn't exist, as the trap rather than flaw in the Death Star's design is, quite frankly, really stupid."
" Disappointing new characters
",-0.4939,0.9469,2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Had quite a good cast of characters in this, Darth Vader was the best character but unfortunately he didn't get a lot of screen time. New characters were lacking, the droid had some funny lines but other than that it was a pretty useless character. Cassian had some interesting backstory but it was very underdeveloped and seemed to lack much personality and uniqueness. Jyn was a bit interesting, but not much. The action scenes and special effects were brilliant but I disliked there wasn't any lightsaber duels, though the Vader scene at the end made up for that a bit. Some of the space battles were entertaining. It was nice to see Mustafar again.The characters overall were too fresh, they only had one film to get the viewer to know their character and for such a huge franchise like Star Wars having the main characters as new characters with hardly any personality is very disappointing. They should've at least made the major new characters relatable to previous well established Star Wars characters, the lack of interesting new characters is the main reason I can't give this film a 9/10."
" The perfect portrayal of a gritty war movie
",-0.0516,-0.9975,2020-04-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie wasn't perfect all-around, but it is a perfect portrayal of the ""wars"" in ""Star Wars.""Let's start off with the few problems with the films:1. Pacing - The first part of this film was kind of lacking in pacing, but I won't bug about it too much because this is a film that you need to be emotionally attached to the characters, hence it would be difficult to do that for just a standalone film.2. Jyn's Story - I feel like the way of portraying Jyn in this film was kind of off. They put too much effort in explaining Jyn's story such as full-on flashbacks (didn't mind the opening scene though) which aren't always needed when they could've done it in more subtle ways.Let's move on to the many strengths of this film:1. Cinematography - This movie takes cinematography to Star Wars in a whole new level and is not even challenged by the cinematography of the other movies. Every single shot of the Death Star or its victims are purely outstanding, and The Devastator (Vader's Star Destroyer that came in late into the Battle of Scarif) exiting hyperspace was both aesthetically pleasing and stroke fear into the viewers.2. Portrayal of the Empire - The Empire in this movie was portrayed to perfection. In the Originals, most Imperials, especially the Stormtroopers, were portrayed as a weak force in comparison to the heroes of the Rebellion, which is fair considering Stormtroopers are grunts of the Empire against heroes of the Rebellion. However, this film really portrays them as a scary force, and they are even portrayed as elites that are much more skilled than the rebels (an example being the Death Troopers).3. Portrayal of the Rebellion - The Rebellion in this movie was portrayed as a group of hopefuls and not an unbreakable shield. The Rebels are also portrayed as literally terrorists (i.e. Battle of Jedha) and would favor guerilla attacks regardless of the risk of civilian casualties. They are even portrayed as ""just an alliance"" who would constantly argue on things.4. Battle of Jedha - The Battle of Jedha was a perfect portrayal of the Imperials as Marines on-duty and the Rebels as actual terrorists. It shows how Rebels would naturally prefer guerilla attacks and would favor hiding within the civilians instead of going head-on against the Empire. It also shows us how Stormtroopers should genuinely be able to hit their targets and actually use their scopes unlike in the OT.5. Battle of Eadu - The Battle of Eadu was a great mid-movie battle to keep you interested. It even gives you that gritty war theme due to the battle being set on a rainy evening. The X-Wings flying through the rain is a beautiful scene before the start of a short but satisfying battle.6. Battle of Scarif - The Battle of Scarif is, hands-down, the best battle in all of Star Wars (both ground and space). The fanservice of rebels exiting hyperspace was a good way to start the battle along with the appearance of Red Leader and Gold Leader. The Star Destroyers in this were portrayed as extremely menacing but had a vulnerability, which is nice. The fleet of TIEs exiting the hangars was absolutely outstanding, and Vader intercepting the rebels' escape with The Devastator was a great portrayal of him.The ground battle really nailed the portrayal of how much better the Empire is than the rebels. The Stormtroopers can actually hit targets. The Death Troopers jumping out of the TIE-Reaper was also a great show of Imperial intimidation. It also shows how rebels shouldn't really be able to win a fair battle against the Empire without them all dying in the process, and they usually just retreat after succeeding at their goal (in this, it would be stealing the Death Star plans)7. Vader's Portrayal - The use of Darth Vader in this movie was so good. He was advertised a lot, so he wasn't just some cameo character, unlike another villain we know from the Sequels. However, they didn't use him too much to the point that he wouldn't steal the show until all the heroes were dead. He was even portrayed as pure evil with the final scene and shows why he's really worth fearing.8. Krennic's Portrayal - Krennic is the perfect example of a man who just wants to earn recognition within the Empire. He isn't a ruthless dictator like Tarkin, isn't a glorified warrior like Phasma, isn't a Sith like Vader. He's just a man who wants recognition from the Emperor but is stopped by his superiors (i.e. Grand Moff Tarkin) The way he's portrayed is actually kind of sympathetic. You could actually feel more sorry for his death than most of the heroes' death. Ben Mendelsohn did a great job with him."
" Cracking spin-off that hits all the right notes
",0.0,0.9996,2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"In a galaxy, far far away.....I was slightly disappointed to not hear the usual rousing Star Wars music at the beginning. Then I thought to myself, this is not strictly a Star Wars film, but a standalone spin-off. I accepted the loss of the music shortly afterwards, but upon reflection now, I think it was missed opportunity. Every time that music starts when you're at the big screen, it makes the hairs on the back of your neck raise. Mistake not including it there I think. Staying with the music, the old familiar scores are there, but many are slightly different, changed. I personally would have kept with Williams' perfect orchestral scores in their original format, but I guess over time things slowly adapt. None of this is to say the score is bad because it is not. The score is fantastic and those familiar sounds are heard in all the right places.Anyway, Rogue One is the story of the rebels who steal the plans to the death star. This is what happens immediately before Episode IV: A New Hope. Where A New Hope starts off Rogue One ends. For once I'm not going to give any details anyway or review the start of the film as I often do. If you want to know the rebels story then go and watch it. The script is above average for this kind of film and Disney do seem to have made a good effort of getting this one right. If you were less than impressed with A Force Awakens then this title will surely keep you happy. I thought this was a more like a cross between A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. The story is interesting and reasonably well told. I managed to keep myself spoiler free for this so was pleasantly surprised with what I watched. Any fan of the franchise (and certainly fans of the original trilogy) kind of know the back-story to the rebels obtaining the plans, but it is enjoyable to actually see that story and their sacrifice.The acting for the most part is pretty good, but let us be honest here, with the odd exception the Star Wars films in general have not been known or their Oscar worthy performances. Rogue One is no different really from any of the other films. Everyone plays their part reasonably, even the relative newcomers. The 'returning' characters (especially one in particular) are a joy to behold (in this reviewers opinion) and certainly heightened my enjoyment of the film. There has been some backlash from some of the CGI use but it never felt out of place to me though at times it's not quite perfect. As for the rest of the effects they are top notch indeed. This is a fantasy science-fiction film. It is Star Wars. The CGI and effects are strong in this one. But it is all done for the most part brilliantly. It truly is a big screen spectacle as any film in this franchise should be.The cast is also a high point for Rogue One. While there are many unfamiliar faces, there are also many many returning faces from not just the prequels but also the original trilogy. This certainly was nice to see and gave us old fans something to smile about. If you have been following our Facebook page then you should know I was excited to see Donnie Yen and he does not disappoint. His solo scene is well done (and was probably expected from his fans) and I enjoyed his screen time though I wish he had more of it, or perhaps a more important role. Wen Jiang (who I am also a fan of) is also great as Yen's side-kick. As usual for Star Wars of late, the comedic relief comes in the form of the droids and Rogue One is no exception. K-2SO is a great character who is dry, witty and sentimental. Felicity Jones does a reasonable job as the lead and it's also good to see Mads Mikkelsen on the screen. Pity his screen time is very short though.There are some continuity issues and the ending leaves some unanswered questions regarding the start of A New Hope, but hopefully these will be cleared up with a longer version release. The directing is more than adequate and the cinematography, set design and locations are all fantastic. The film does suffer from some slightly dragged out scenes at times but these are usually quickly followed by frantic action sequences. And those sequences come think and fast. With Rogue One Disney have truly captured that Star Wars feeling with a grand entry in the space opera saga. Many people, myself included were wary of Disney acquiring the rights to Star Wars and perhaps feared which direction they may take the franchise. After A Force Awakens I was personally still on the fence, but I knew what to expect with that particular film. Rogue One has definitely dispelled any reservations I still had. I'm actually glad Lucas sold it as in my own humble opinion he was starting to ruin the franchise. Disney's plans for the franchise are certainly ambitious (as you would expect given the price paid, they will want a substantial return on that investment).Overall Rogue One is a very solid entry into the Star Wars universe and certainly the best film of the newer titles. The Empire Strikes Back will always be perhaps the best film, with A New Hope perhaps being the mostly fondly remembered, but Rogue One sits firmly alongside those two classic titles. Not as good as Empire for sure, but a very worthy addition to the saga and one that should surely please all but the purist of fans.
The Sage's Rating: 8/10"
" From the five I watched thus far this one was the weaker one, still good though.
",0.0,0.9849,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, it's now time for Rogue One. I read some reviewers stating this was one of the best one but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. It's still good enough for me though, just found the story confusing sometimes. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the fifth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one tonight will be A New Hope in the hope the quality stays the same, looking forward to it."

" Does Justice to the Original Trilogy
",0.6908,0.9564,2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One takes place right before the beginning of A New Hope.And it fits in perfectly with the original trilogy!The story, characters, visuals, CGI, and light humor are all superb.I love the ruthlessness of Director Krennic, Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader.The different planets (especially Scariff, where the engineering plans for all of the Empire's bases are kept) look spectacular.The fight scenes (ground, space and aerial) look so realistic.I have to give Gareth Edwards and his people 10 stars for such a magnificent effort!"

" The best Stars Wars Film of them all - HONEST!
",0.7118,0.9529,2020-04-03 00:00:00,9,"Oh yes - in my honest opinion, this is THE best Star Wars film of them all. Even better than The Empire Strikes Back, and that is some claim so at least I should attempt to explain myself (I may struggle!).I stand by opinion 1000%. Up until Rogue One appeared on our screens, The Empire Strikes Back was the go-to movie. Dark, sinister and moody with spectacular set pieces, the film took the Star Wars universe to a different level, focusing on the desperate fight between good and evil (which in essence is what this franchise is all about). Nothing before or since this film has come even close; in comparison, most of the other movies are either a bit tame or just plain dreadful. So watching Rogue One was not an experience where I had the feeling of much hope (but then Rebellions, as they say, are built on hope!) After 2 hours and 13 minutes, I realised that I had not just watched a great Star Wars film - I had watched the best one of all.Why? OK, here goes.The Plotline
It's ingenious. How the writers managed to take a line from Mon Mothma in 'A New Hope' and turn it into a 2-hour long film is smart, to say the least. And it works too. The idea of creating a back story focusing on how the plans for the Death Star come into the hands of the Rebel Alliance is a stroke of genius. The story is compelling and introduces an entirely new cast and with one fundamental difference between all Stars Wars films. There is no hope for the main protagonists; there is no happy ending. Here lies true heroism in the face of Imperial annihilation.The Cast & Characters
One of the difficult hurdles that Rogue One needed to get over was creating characters that the audience could believe in, and the producers achieved this in most parts, flawlessly. It helps that, unlike in previous iterations, the cast of this film act exceptionally well. Felicity Jones (as Jyn) does a fantastic job and at times, delivers a barnstorming performance. Cassian's objectives are shrouded in mystery, and he gives a brooding, tortured performance. Baze (Wen Jiang) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) are bickering buddies and stellar, triumphant heroes. Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) plays the villain of the piece gloriously over the top. However, the laughs and the stand out performance all come from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO. A literal, caustic and sarcastic droid who delivers his lines with a blunted severity that has you laughing out loud. No gimmicks, no ingenious tech. It is the character aspect that makes K-2SO the best droid of all.Set Pieces
It's easy to forget how many fabulous set-pieces there are in this film. The most expansive is the battle on and above Scarif, but there are so many more. The fight scenes and destruction of Jedha, the attack on the crystal mining colony. There is, of course, a lot of CGI going on here but it is delivered at such a pace and in such an exhilarating way that it immerses you in the Star War Universe and gives you the box seat.Bad Bits?
Well, there are some but thankfully very few, and not enough to detract from what is an epic movie. Saw Gerrera is dissapointing which is a surprise considering Forrest Whittakers acting credentials. The film also delivers an astounding piece of CGI and then near the end, an utterly laughable one. I thought Peter Cushing had miraculously come back from the dead or there was a doppelganger in the acting world, for at least for a few seconds. The way the filmmakers did this with CGI was impressive, using a real actor and a voice that sounded very similar. However, Leia's appearance at the end was shockingly bad, totally unconvincing, and one intelligent step too far. It was unnecessary in the scheme of things. Vaders voice didn't work either which is nobody's fault since James Earl Jones is now 89, and his voice has lost that sinister grit. He could have been helped with some better dialogue to be honest. ""Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director"" seemed a bit contrived to me. Not the least bit scary.Still, Rogue One is an unexpected gem. When compared to all that has gone before, it is better written, better produced, better acted and does one thing that all other Star Wars film failed to do apart from Empire. It makes you care. For me, there are only two Star Wars films worth watching. This one is the most fulfilling although the Battle of Hoth for me is still the standout sequence of any in the entire franchise.Please take note Disney - originality, competent acting, real drama and not so happy endings make better films rather than the regurgitated nonsense of the Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.Today's children are intelligent enough to take it."
" The best
",0.6369,0.9889,2020-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Some might consider this heresy, but the truth is this movie is far better than any of the trilogies. It has a tight plot, it keeps its pace ideal throughout, the production values are outstanding, award-winning score, and excellent acting.There are simply no weaknesses here.For a script concept based off the intro screen crawl from Episode IV: A New Hope, it was amazing what a brilliant story this movie told. It also answered the age-old question about why a flaw would exist in the original Death Star, something that was the object of more than a few on-stage jokes. Well, the joke is explained in a realistic and intriguing way.If all of the Star Wars movies could reach this level of overall value, there would likely be no ongoing fan conflict. This is must watch material."

This is a story we haven't heard before. The characters are awesome (and without giving anything away, let's just say it pays off if you watched the Clone Wars tv series), the action sequences are amazing, and it feels like classic Star Wars while at the same time providing something new. The comic relief character is extremely well written with how a bit too honest he is. This has some new genres being explored in the Star Wars universe, which was something I liked about the Clone Wars tv show. My only complaint is that at times the CGI used to make some of the cameos of characters from the Original Trilogy look young looks a bit fake, like you could tell it was CGI. It's not as bad as young Jeff Bridges in ""Tron: Legacy"", but it looks a bit too shiny and at times like it's from a video game cutscene.

" Easily the best of the Disney Era
",0.765,0.9851,2020-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I always liked this movie since it came out in 2016. But for some reason, when I rewatched in August 2018 it really struck me. I just went from thinking that it was good to loving it. The movie itself doesn't do a great job setting up the characters on its own, but I've read some books surrounding this movie since that help flesh it out. A book called Rebel Rising which was all about Jyn, and a book called Catalyst which was all about Galen, both of which were pretty good. Especially Rebel Rising. So this time with the background knowledge, the movie was more effective.Well now for the actual movie. All the technical aspects of the movie are fantastic. There is great action and visuals all throughout. I can only recall one or two scene where it felt at all fake. (Borgullet & the resurrected actors). All the backgrounds and all the planets felt real. And the Death Star effect was spectacular.The characters, like I said before, are better with the books. I guess that is kinda lazy on the movie's part, but it doesn't bother me personally. The best character in this movie if you exclude any literary content I'd K2-SO. He's hilarious and his death was the only one that really made me sad the first time I watched it. The comedy in this movie is great and it's mostly thanks to K2.And the movie has an interesting story to tell as well, and it answers probably the biggest question left by A New Hope. Pretty much all the details of getting the Death Star plans. For most of the movie, it's interesting to watch this plot unfold. It is a little slow at points unfortunately. Though it never makes the movie unbearably boring. Most of the characters deaths are effective as well. Although I could care less about Bodhi.And finally. This movie probably has my favourite scene in all of Star Wars. The Darth Vader hallway scenes is just perfection. It gives me chills and I have a smile on my face every time I watch it.This movie gets 92%"

The line the guy says about how ""we've all been spies, assassins, saboteurs, all doing things we'd rather forget for the good of the cause ... "" explains his rather curious action at the beginning of the movie. The scientists all lines up on the bridge look like *scientists*--like Wernher Von Braun or U.S. scientists here, caught up in ""Operation Paperclip"" and other shenanigans, having to do with War and where the Work Went for Scientists to Do.

" Boom! That's how it's done!
",0.0,0.8831,2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Rogue One may be my favourite Star Wars movie. It's smart, funny, dark, gritty, exciting and tragic all at the same time.The designs in it are awesome, and Jyn Erso is an instant hit as the film's lead. Cassian and K2 provide the perfect back up for her, Cassian used to inject a little darkness into the light of the Rebellion and K2 bringing the humour. The rest of the team are fun but inevitably less mmorable given there's only one film to get to know them. Where the film really shines though is its villains. Ben Mendehlsson portrays their nemesis Director Krennic, and is one of the best Star Wars villains we've had - the perfect mix of villainy and humanity. The ghost of Peter Cushing stands behind him with the CGI reconstruction of Grand Moff Tarkin - a very impressive feat and perfect return for the original imperial officer. Perhaps its greatest accomplishment though is Darth Vader - swaggering back onto the big screen, more dangerous than ever, and stealing the film with only a couple of short scenes. That last scene though is the one that has had everyone talking ever since.The film gives us a chance to see the darker reality of the conflict between Rebels and Imperials, showcasing the futility of Rebellion and the power of hope side by side. It feels real in a way perhaps no other Star Wars film does. Bravely, it doesn't shy away from the inevitability of its ending, embracing it in a powerful show of a true last ditch attempt and one of the most moving battles in sci fi cinema.Freed from the constraints of the Skywalker saga, Rogue One feels free-er to do its own thing and stand on its own two feet, but its close proximity to the main series is its strength, feeling relevant in a way Solo didn't and far more powerful.It might be a little long, slowing down a bit in the middle, and the darker nature of the film might not be to every Star Wars fan's taste but for me: Rogue One stands out above the rest at the top of my most-likely-to-rewatch list."

",0.0,0.9688,2020-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Hands down the best in this new generation of Star Wars movies. Rogue One steps back in time, slipping right in between episode III and IV, to witness the daring adventures and perilous gambit of the brave souls that captured the Death Star plans for the Rebellion.Our ragtag group of rebels is a mixed bag. The lead two, I actually feel pretty ambivalent on. They're not bad or anything but they don't exactly wore me either. Then you look at Alan Tudyk's hilarious, movie stealing, battle droid or Donnie Yen's remarkably universe expanding blind monk and I can't help but think they're some of the best Star Wars characters we've had in a long while (don't worry Kylo, you're in that list too).The film is fun, adventurous and fits quite nicely into the Star Wars universe, expanding on the lore without detracting a thing.The problem here is that it's still a Star Wars movie. As such, they just have to add a bunch of nods and callbacks to the other movies in really obvious and forced ways. Among these is a downright disturbing glimpse of a CGI rendered fan favorite that straight up creeps me out. If they could have dialed the fan service back a bit, this would have been an exceptional journey.Still, the ending is so amazing it makes up for a lot and we left with a movie that's a lot of fun, feels relevant and builds the universe. Definitely worth a watch."

Felicity Jones tries to help the rebels obtain the plans for the planet-blasting ""Death Star"" that was designed by her father (Mads Mikkelsen). It's end-to-end action, with great special effects and a whole slew of new characters to get to know/like/loathe, without having to have seen any of the other films. Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn don't quite cut the mustard for me; and indeed the cast could all gel a bit better as actors; but the story is exciting and much closer to the action-packed style of the first trilogy.

It actually delved into the force a little bit which was refreshing. Rather than people having super powers you didn't know they could do until the plot demands it; they had a good look at what the rebels actually want. Not all of them want to be Jedi's some of them just want to fight with laser guns and space ships too. Honestly that's more interesting to me than anything Jedi related. And that's what was cool about Star Wars to begin with! They appealed to people on both sides like Luke and Han! Pretty cheesy speeches, some nonsense scenes, the constant nostalgia tropes and over the top drama earn it a 6 in my book"

The story is executed near perfectly, and I was very surprised how much I was able to care about the characters despite them not being in any other film.

Disney, pay attention: This is how it should be done.The film is not without flaws - the obvious problems are the couple of prominent CGI characters. The CGI on these two is noticeably uncanny. The second of these characters in particular is so jarring in appearance as to really throw you out of the moment. But it's a passing moment towards the end of the film.Immense respect to Gareth Edwards and the writers for crafting a coherent story in the Star Wars Universe, without falling back on the over-done Star Wars cliches, but still somehow keeping very true to the spirit and feel of the saga.Highlights for me:
The final battle; very well shot, genuinely thrilling; brings some menace and exhilaration back to classic Star Wars designs and characters.The droid - a genuinely original take on the faithful droid sidekick.The main characters - what a pleasure to see heroic characters written with some actual nuance.Thanks Mr Edwards and co.

This and The Mandalorian show are the best things to come out of Disney thus far. The fact that the Force Awakens has a better score than this movie is a testament to the mental capacity of our society. I don't feel like writing a long-winded review as most people do on here. The movie is well done and was a great prelude into the original Starwars trilogy. It had a good story, suspense a lot of action, great battle scenes and a compelling climax that leads perfectly into episode IV.. Including past characters from the old Trilogy throughout the movie was also a nice touch.. This was simply about a good story and movie without all the other crap.. The only progressive part they stuffed into this one was to make the radical rebels resemble Muslim Freedom fighters, but other than that it was just focused on the story..
In summary this was a more riveting and serious take on Starwars that felt authentic, yet less juvenile. ...Force Awakens in contrast had a very teen ""Disney"" feel throughout the movie with a cast you would expect from Disney..If our society made sense, the ratings would be similar to
Force awakens mid 6's
Last Jedi 5-6
Rogue one 8-9+

" Middle-ing Star Wars Fun
",-0.0772,0.9944,2020-01-07 00:00:00,6,"""Rogue One"" is the definition of a mixed bag. I find myself in a similar position with this film as I am in regard to ""Solo."" I like the movie but would never dream of defending it as a great film.It really is a mess. The characters are mostly uninteresting, the connection between father and daughter that should be the core of this film feels anemic, and the progression of the plot from one sequence to the next is done in an incredibly slapdash way so that even after multiple viewings, I found myself having to refresh my memory about basic plot points.Luckily, this film is not without its bright points to make the ride more fun. The first of which, for me, is K2-SO. Alan Tudyk (""Serenity"") does a brilliant job voicing the reprogrammed Imperial droid with sarcasm, near nihilism, and an endearing love/loathe relationship with Jyn (Felicity Jones, ""Inferno""). In fact, K2-SO has become my personal favorite amongst the droid characters of the Star Wars universe. The most meaningful and moving scene of the film may actually be the sacrifice of this character who is more human than the humans in this movie.Another character to highlight is that of Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, ""Hero""). A non-Jedi force believer who harkens back to Blind Swordsman or Warrior Monk tales of Japan and China. His role in the rebellion on Jetta and Scarif is minor but flavorful and brings out the depth that is hinted at in other films when they speak of the force and the legend of the Jedi Knights.Sadly, this film leaves little more for us to enjoy when it comes to characters. The protagonists are thin and change motivations on a dime. They eat up screen time with their monologues and leave us wishing we got additional time with the minor characters, who are more interesting and endearing.Another high point of the film is the climactic sequence on the planet Scarif. Not since the assault on Hoth (""The Empire Strikes Back"") have we been treated to a battle so engaging and complex. Ground forces tactical movements, an orbital battle that recaptures the magic of the battle over Endor, and numerous moments of personal sacrifice, twists of fate, and moments of triumph make this sequence one of my favorite Star Wars battles. Period.I for one am not a big fan of using CGI to insert original actors into new films. I personally think they should get other actors to play the part or even simply write around those characters. That being said, the CGI is remarkably good. A few moments of wavering believability do not erase, for me, the incredible achievement that this film has managed to pull off. Grand Moff Tarkin looks great, Leia, a little less so but still solid and serviceable. Even using footage from ""A New Hope"" to supplement and create the illusion that the fighter pilots from that film are the same as the ones in this battle.To be fair, though, that is the majority of what I like about this movie. I wish these Star Wars Stories were not so plagued by production, script, and directorial difficulties but they have been and they have suffered for it. Rogue One is no exception.It has suffered but, if you wade through what is a wildly uneven film, there are truly wonderful aspects of this film to enjoy."
" The most humane Star Wars of all
",-0.5945,-0.2148,2020-01-07 00:00:00,9,"It really touched me. It is not just a Star Wars movie. It's much more than that. It's a movie that you don't have to be a Star Wars fun in order to watch it. It's a war drama, a story of resistance against the tyrrany, a resistance made by common people just like us. They are not indestructable ,they don't have superhuman powers, they are human beings of flesh and blood. And they die. They all die because they can be killed just like anyone and because they are fighting against overwhelming odds. It' a pattern which has been repeated countless of times during the human history. Common people fighting and sacrificing their lives for freedom. It could be a story taking place in Nazi Occupied Europe during WWII as well. It's a movie that everyone can watch regardless of which type of movies one preferes. It's worth it."

" Best one
",0.6369,-0.9509,2019-12-31 00:00:00,6,"'Rogue One' is the best Disney Star Wars film, which is not a high accolade, and the best Star Wars franchise film since the original trilogy, which is a similarly low threshold sadly.In its own right 'Rogue One' manages to tell a decent tale; plus show respect and sympathy to its originating source material and, as a vehicle for Disney, it manages to establish a reasonable start to Disney Lucasfilm's desire to produce self contained anthology spin off Star Wars films.Built upon a foundation of such films as 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'The Magnificent 7' a random ragtag group of individualists pursue a common purpose for an almost common goal against the backdrop of a powerful military threat 'Rogue One' tells it's story straight and without too much originality. As it is attempting to justify its own newness as a Star Wars anthology film this is probably a reasonable restraint in narrative invention.However there is a more involved level of treatment in the films themes, which focus on generational split, trust, manipulation, opposition of agendas and the experience of youth in an already established world created for them, by their elders, not by them. All these themes are played out via character traits, interactions and discoveries and under the pressure of the sprawl of an oppressive, destructive and hateful Empire pressurising every enmeshed characters realities.As an anthology film 'Rogue One' is positioned as an unofficial prequel to 'A New Hope' which it respects in its iconography whilst expanding on in cannon: the idea that the oppression and extortion that the Galactic Empire functioned by had caused the Death Star itself to have deliberately had a design flaw worked into it as a personal rebellion by its Chief designer.There are certain problems with the narrative delivery of 'Rogue One', the plot development and characters that prevent me from giving a higher rating however.The plot is overactive and loses a lot of its focus with jumping left and right at every opportunity to the next world and set piece action routine.There is an overall loss of direction for the actors and scenes as the film enters it's second half.Too many supporting characters fail to be characterized in their own right but are instead given just one identifying feature/function; this may be due to the declining directing of the film, or the writing: simply put there are too many characters doing similar things to satisfactorily differentiate.The juddering midpoint sequence of the film where the ""Rogue One"" team and mission forms up is not so well prefigured and is therefore uneasily established.The level of contrivance needed to get a desperado team (Rogue One.) from within an over cautious rebellion at that juncture takes some accepting.The climactic battle, happening in and around the imperial library has the sense of being designed for a computer game and not a film. It's echoing of infiltration on the Death Star in 'A New Hope' and the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader in 'Empire' doesn't outweigh that it is utterly unbelievable as a developing story.The space fleet battle around the planetary shield gates in orbit above the library is even more garbled. The entire shakedown of that battle suggests the imperial forces affording every opportunity to the rebels. Again like a computer game opponent.I rate 6/10 for a Star Wars film that I prefer to any other made in the last 35 years. It honours it's sources and builds carefully upon the visuals and themes of the original trilogy. Whilst developing it's own comments about the damage done by tyranny and resistance via it's own characters. Larger problems with the film are balanced by these strong attributes."
" One of the best Star Wars movies ever made
",0.1531,-0.021,2019-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Rogue One only comes very close to being the top SW movie and maybe if I was a bit younger I'd voted it so, but it has some minor moments that hold it back (ep IV and V being top for me).The movie starts a bit slow, but very quickly picks up the pace, builds its characters very well, so well in fact that every single team member death brings a tear in the eyes of those of us who cry at movies. Action is on point, pacing and storyline as well. What impresses most is the realism, if such a thing is possible in fantasy (SW is in my opinion fantasy in space rather than sci-fi), that encapsulates the entire movie. People, who matter die, just like unnamed innocents, a suicide mission is not just a word to build tension, but actually proves to be just so, and that is rare thing in today's cinema - to achieve a finale where everyone dies, tragic yet knowing that the mission is a success, transitionning smoothly into ""A new hope IV""."

" The best SW movie since the original trilogy.
",0.7579,-0.4831,2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy. I honestly assumed beforehand that this was going to be one of the worst of the new Star Wars films, considering the plot - I mean, did any Star Wars fan ever really cry out for a movie telling us how the Rebel Alliance got hold of the schematics to the Death Star? I for one certainly didn't. It's sounds like filler, and a complete cash in. Yet, against all the odds, my prejudices and presuppositions, somehow they managed to make a really enjoyable Star Wars movie, which is more faithful to the style, themes and quality of the originals than any other Star Wars movie to date.'Rogue One' demonstrates that you do can wonders with a very simple, yet effective storyline provided you make it fun, interesting, well paced with likeable, underdog characters. Heck, they even nailed the comic relief here as well - it's (thankfully) employed sparingly but tactfully, never feeling forced, and generating a genuine chuckle here or there. The battles scenes also don't feel generic like in many special effect driven movies, but felt quite gritty and visceral. And the brief scene with Darth Vader in pursuit of stolen plans in the narrow corridor near the end paid more respect to his character than any of the prequels did, which more or less sabatoged his reputation and legacy.It's the first time since the originals you get a sense of real menace from from the Dark Side (with perhaps the exception of Darth Maul), and that the stakes for both Rebel Alliance and the Empire are high, and the deaths of the rebels actually counted for something. A worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise, which is more than can be said of most SW movies since the original trilogy."

",-0.4676,0.9798,2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Especially after watching Episode 9 Rogue One may not be the most entertaining of the new Star Wars movies, but it is by far the most coherent, since it has a perfect balance between realism, fantasy, humor, action and character development. I wished episode 7 to 9 were that good.Rogue One is a complete Story with good characters and an interesting story idea. The overall look and feel i enjoy the most and it overshadows a bit a lack of overall tension - in a positive way.It may is an advantage that Rogue One did not need to tie into the Skywalker Saga, just being a side story and have an independent story to tell with new characters.Although i generally did not like the type of ending they choose, it's the perfect and best choice possible and it's also different from any other Star Wars movie."
" Easily my favourite Star Wars Movie
",-0.296,0.9918,2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Its taken me a long time to watch any of this Disney Star Wars films after the terrible reviews they have been getting.
But having just watched Rogue One I was really pleased with what I saw. Great story, great action, great characters, just a really great movie. I absolutely loved the K2 droid, after seeing c3po for so many years, K2 was a definitely a welcome change, he was so funny.
So disappointed with myself for not wanting to watch this a long long time ago."
" An unbalanced but enjoyable film
",0.5927,-0.6115,2019-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Rogue One contains many scenes that would likely satisfy Star Wars fans and general viewers alike in the second half of the film. This film appropriately acts as a reasonable ""bridge"" between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.The action sequences and aerial battle scenes were exciting, breathtaking and are definitely worth watching. Several references to the Original Trilogy as well as the Prequel Trilogy were excellent additions to the film.However, the first half of the film had a somewhat ""messy"" plot and unbalanced direction. The pacing was also very confusing and incoherent for viewers to follow. The film also suffers from unbalanced development of some of its characters.Overall, this film functions well as a Star Wars-based war film, and an Anthology film for the Star Wars universe. However, it does not have much to offer to the expanding lore of the Star Wars universe, and has issues with the introduction of new characters."

" Just One Long Video Game Cutscene Posing as a Star Wars ""Film""
",-0.5574,0.5323,2019-12-24 00:00:00,3,"I put film in quotations because this is not a film (nor was it even shot on film) but instead a very expensive and glorified fan boy..... I guess I can call it video?Where do I begin?Well the acting is awful (except for the robot, ironically). The action scenes are so uninspired that I actually fell asleep during one of them. Rogue One has zero inspiration and the lead character's personality is about as wooden and stiff as a bird house in the middle of winter. The film is off fan boy nostalgia with showing Darth Vader in between the prequels and original movies. However, James Earl Jones voice sounds tired and bored, just like I was when watching this. So this kind of digital cinema fodder is what we can expect from Disney for the next infinite amount of years?.Bottom line, Rogue One is an uninspired, uninnovative fan boy cash grab for the Disney Mega-Corporation. Stick to the Skywalker sagas, those films at least still have the ""feel"" of Star Wars and avoid this ""film"" like a dirty toilet seat at a Truck Stop. Rogue One simply adds nothing to the franchise."

Containing another robot would seem like a ripoff of C3PO, but to be honest it is quite surprising that the movie does not try to copy anything from the previous movies. No unnecessary scenes about wannabe Jedis relying on the force. The only ones handling a lightsaber is the one and only Darth Vader. Even he gets a spot in this movie together with his daughter Leia.Definitely a movie for Star Wars fans and enthousiasts!"

I love how Jynn Erso falls in love with a Hispanic man, that'll definitely get her brutal white Imperialist ancestors out of her children. I loved how Jynn's smelly white feet gently pounded on wet soil in this film, I found that very cute. The battle sequences were amazing and the special effects were out of this world. Could've been better if there were some transexual's, homosexuals and pansexual's in it though as a reminder that diversity is a strength. As diversity is a strength there should've been far more animals, mentally disabled people and robots in this film as well."

It shows how the rebels actually got their hands on the Death Star plans. This is a great self contained story, as it introduces many new characters. This is also a bad self contained story, as none of the newly introduced characters appear in any of the other films, so you kind of know who will be killed off. It is for this reason that I gave it seven stars. Had the movies been released in order, this would have been a solid 9."

" Men on a Mission
",0.0,0.8797,2019-12-19 00:00:00,7,"It's a man on a mission story that focuses way too much time on one of the members of the gang to too little emotional impact, even though that's the obvious desire, to create an emotional impact. The movie ends up working despite the repeated emotional faceplants involving its main character because they're a relatively small part of the overall film, the rest being a pretty straight forward telling of a The Dirty Dozen type story...in SPACE!!!!The emotional problems with the film stem from the fact that Jyn Erso's character is caught between two father figures and neither one of them develops a relationship with her in the film itself. There's her father, the Imperial scientist with whom she, as a child and through a different actress than we see through the rest of the film, has a very brief scene where her father, Galen, tells her to run and hide from the Imperial officers coming to their remote farm in the first act. The other is Saw Gerrera, an extremist Rebel who takes in Jyn, but we never see them together in the first act. If the point of her journey, and the movie's emotional delivery, is supposed to be Jyn dealing with her absentee fathers, the movie never gives us a scene where Jyn is actually with them in any normal capacity. So, when she gets reunited with both of them at about the 30 minute mark of the film, the scenes are played with sweeping emotional music, but they fall flat. She's crying at reunions with people we've never seen her with, so it feels like it comes out of nowhere because it does. Everything feels incongruous to the situation because of the distinct lack of emotional connection.The majority of the film, though, isn't dedicate to Jyn's empty emotional connections but to the assembling of a team in a gritty warlike setting. The rest of the characters outside of Jyn have what feels like the correct amount of character. They're individualized enough visually to stand out with strong enough individual motivations to get them on board with the adventure believably. It's the sort of thing you would expect from a man on a mission type film.The mission itself is, of course, to locate the plans to the newest Imperial weapon, the Death Star. It all hinges on the lead engineer, Galen, having built a failure mechanism into the plans and getting that information to the nascent Rebel Alliance. As a side note, I've always preferred my pet theory that the fault was because the thermal exhaust port lead engineer couldn't get the funding he needed for all of the safety mechanisms, so he just finished at least one of them without the proper safety protocols. Anyway, this fault exists and the ragtag group of rebels end up going to the Imperial data storage facility on Scarif.The setup around Scarif is complicated, presenting the band with a series of obstacles that are clearly defined. The storytelling of the final large action sequence is some of the clearest in the movie, despite the visual chaos on screen. The rebels need to go from a landing pad into the tower of a facility, grab the plans, and then get to the top of the tower and the large satellite to transmit it to the Alliance. There arrives a space battle as well when the reticent Alliance comes to support the rebels on the ground who left without Alliance permission.This sequence is some of the brightest and prettiest of any action sequence in Star Wars, especially the stuff in space. There's also an inventiveness to the action, like the ramming of one Star Destroyer to hit another Star Destroyer, that feels fresh and fun at the same time.The antagonists of the film are a mixed bag to a certain degree. We have three, and only one was really necessary. The best of them, and possibly my favorite antagonist in all of Star Wars is Director Krennic. He's purely a bureaucrat who's driven by the fact that he feels like he's not getting enough credit for the completion of the Death Star and that he got passed over for a promotion. It's the sort of tangible motive that's missing from most characters in general in big genre films. His drive is really fun. Then we have Tarkin, the CGI recreation of Peter Cushing (that really isn't that bad, just still inside the Uncanny Valley), who functions more as Krennic's antagonist. He still fits the film, though I would call him as much a distraction as anything else. And then we have Darth Vader, who was obviously added greatly in reshoots. His contributions to the film don't move anything in the film, including his much ballyhooed fight in the hallway which looks cool but happens after the central conflict is over, providing just one more meaningless obstacle that wasn't previously established and is only there to give Vader, who doesn't matter to the film in any way, a moment to shine.So, the movie has some biggish flaws, like Jyn's emotional black hole and an overabundance of villains, but it also does a lot right. The men on a mission story is well handled. The central villain is great. The movie looks good, and it ends with a very good final sustained sequence. Not great, but a solid entertainment."

" Aimed at the under 10s?

I struggled to watch this beyond the 30 minute mark as I am considerably over ten years old and so far only the original first three films have been any good. Badly cast and acted with a bad script and gross overuse of CGI in a failed attempt to disguise the many flaws, the music was not up to much either. Take away ""Star Wars"" from the title and its IMDB score would be considerably less as this would result in reviewers being more honest and not biased towards it with ""Star Wars"" in the title. The only character with any personality was the friendly Imperial Droid with the biological actors being very wooden and not connecting with the audience. The abilities of the blind monk were ridiculous and laughable even for a sci-fi film and removed any trace of believability that the film might have had."
" Another Star Wars movie (yawn!) - but another Peter Cushing movie too!
",-0.4374,0.9833,2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"""Rogue One"" is officially a ""Star Wars Story"", which means we get many familiar elements: a rollicking (and explosion-filled) adventure in outer space, almost human androids, switches to pull, chasms to leap and weapons to destroy, and dehumanised stormtroopers to kill (the fact that stormtroopers are hidden behind protective uniforms including face masks makes them more frightening adversaries, but also removes any moral complexity associated with their annihilation). The original Star Wars movie was partially filmed in the North African desert, and a desert environment has also featured in some subsequent movies in the series; in this one, a substantial section seems more inspired by the experience of American troops attempting to police Baghdad. The film contains various other nods to previous films in the series, without recapitulating their plots as shamelessly as 'The Force Awakens' did; as an immediate prequel to the 1979 film, it also uses digital technology to resuscitate now dead actors to reprise their roles, including Peter Cushing (brilliantly) and Carrie Fischer (less successfully) - perhaps the fact that Cushing's character has aspects of the undead in the original makes it easier to bring him back to life. The ending is nicely judged in theory but marred by the failure to lift the digital Fisher out of the uncanny valley.The film features a feisty female heroine, praised by many for providing gender-balance to the previously masculine Star Wars world, but she's a bit too perfect for my liking. One of the things that made the original work for me that none of the naïve Luke, the money-grabbing Han nor the sarcastic Leia are obvious role-models. We also get one character who channels the force to become a martial-arts superhero; I much preferred the subtler demonstration of the force's power shown by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original film (and indeed, the theme of the force is much stronger, to my reckoning, when presented as the power of self-control and focus than when it appears to confer mystical powers).'Rogue One' is considered by many to be their favourite 'Star Wars' movie since the original trilogy; for me, the shtick has grown a bit tired (I loved 'A New Hope' on release, but I was seven years old at the time!). Still, the film mercifully lacks the over-busy aesthetic (and tedious dialogue) of George Lucas's later films in favour of something closer to the mood and spirit of the original; it works as entertainment, even if I suspect this fictional universe doesn't really have much new to show us beyond what has already been done."
" Love this movie

" The Best Disney Star Wars Movie.
",0.1531,0.9891,2019-12-16 00:00:00,8,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does the unthinkable. It makes an already amazing film (A New Hope) even better by fixing decade-old plot holes. The reason for the simple destruction of the infamous Death Star is finally explained. We finally get a movie about the heroes which quietly get pushed away on the sidelines. This movie is essentially the first paragraph of Episode IV's opening crawl. Gareth Edwards proves that he has the eye to produce A-level blockbuster action. Effects are always top notch, acting is good (even though Forest Whitaker seems to be overacting as an older Saw Gerrera), but the movie does tend to jump from place to place. A great tie-novel to read aside seeing the movie is Catalyst by James Luceno. The characters of Jyn Erso and Galen Erso are fleshed out very well in both the book and the movie. It is unfortunate that Bodhi (the Imperial pilot-turned Rebel), Baze (heavy weapons specialist), and Chirrut (blind man who's one with the Force) are somewhat treated like throwaway characters. The relationship between Jyn and the leader of the group, Cassian, left me wanting to see more. Having K-2SO in the mix was a perfect addition to the group and provided rewarding moments. The CGI used to recreate the late Peter Cushing as Tarkin does not always work and seems to be given too much screen time rather than use Darth Vader more. The recently deceased Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia is also brought back to the big screen via CGI and is so brief, yet her 10 seconds on screen may leave you feeling misty-eyed or possibly even in tears. Back to Darth Vader however, his voice does sound a bit off as James Earl Jones does seem to indicate his age. Despite this, Darth Vader's final scene in Rogue One is arguably one of the best Star Wars moments of all time. I have seen the movie three times in theaters and find the pacing improves each time. The music mostly works, but given that the brilliant Michael Giacchino was only given 4 weeks to produce the score (after Alexandre Desplat left the project), it's not very memorable. Overall, this is a great movie (not quite as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion) that deserves to be re-watched again and again."

" Fantastic Movie
",0.5574,0.9344,2019-12-15 00:00:00,9,"Rogue One A Star Wars Story. A fantastic story in the Star Wars series that adds alot to A New Hope telling story of how the Death Star Plans where stolen.The characters introduced are great Jyn Erso is an amazing character to bring into the Star Wars Universe.
I also really like what this adds to the Star Wars Universe even answering questions like why the Death Star has that weakness it was her father who put it in on purpose to give the rebels a chance.The effects are amazing and the technology used to bring back Tarkin and Leia look amazing and seeing Tarkin in Star Wars again was really nostalgic for me.
Krennic was an interesting character and played a decent villain.Darth Vader has some really great moments in this one and definitely one of the best moments in Star Wars with him killing the Rebels at the end such great scene.
I also really like the moment on Mustafa and Vader on that planet again ties in the Prequels really well and the fact they got James Earl Jones back was genious.My only real problem with this movie is we don't really get a chance to bound with the characters it's more about the mission rather then the characters.
However there are still some emotional moments like when Jyns find out her father died but its more about mission and what that mission does for the big picture in Star Wars.
And the journey this film takes us on is awesome.The space battle on Scariff was amazing and definitely the best in Star Wars it was Phenomenonal to watch and the effects where amazing and its definitely my favourite moment in this film the whole third act up to seeing Leia is just pure Star Wars.Verdict 9.8/10 a fantastic Star Wars movie with a great action and great new characters it also adds alot to A New Hope and answers alot of questions about the Death Star and how the rebels stole the plans. Some wicked Vader moments aswell and the final act is just pure Star Wars."

Nostalgia 3/5Visual 5/5
It just looks amazing. They really did an amazing job catching the Star Wars feeling and spicing it up with modern technology. From the amazing designed city of Jedha, over the hands down best space fight scene in Star Wars to the freightning end scene and reconciliation to episode IV. Everything just feels so good to watch.Sound 5/5
Just as the visual design the sound design is very good. The soundtrack written by Giacchino feels like Star Wars without copying the original. In cooperation with the overall awesome sound design it manages to create an intense atomsphere. I still hear this alarm from the Tantive IV when i think about the movie,Story 4/5
I honestly dont know what bugs me about the story. Its very good for the cannon and explains a lot before episode IV. Its well written and narrated, its not boring or feels unnecessary and still there is something that does not feel right. Maybe its the rather teenie-like rebellish Jhin Erso at the beginning or the badly explained mindset of Cassan which often leads to weird changes of actions they make. Overall the story still is very good and adds a lot to the canon.Cast 4/5
If you like to watch big hollywood stars on screen this movie is nothing for you. With Felicity Jones in the main role you dont get a big star but its still a really good perfomance, just like with the rest of the cast. They manage to show emotion and passion for the rebel movement. With K-2SO they added a droid supporting role which is worthy of his colleague R2-D2. Forest Whitacker and Mads Mikkelsen are by far the most famous of the cast. As long as you can live with a CGI Grand Moff Tarkin and young Leia or the fact that you will not see a Tarrantino like star ensemble you will have a great time with the acting in this movie.Nostalgia 3/5
While its still a Star Wars movie and I absolutly had a great time watching it (a lot) I have to admit that it doesnt really tickle my nostalgia nerve. Maybe because im not the biggest fan of episode IV. So because of that some of my ratings might be off a bit due to nostalgia glasses but I think I managed to give you my honest opinion."

I am truely surprized that Disney approved a movie this dark, and , yes ill use the word again, uncompromising.For me this is easily the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy. It doesnt lean on the popularity of the franchise to succeed. There are no Jedi, no lightsabre battles and none of the original characters (apart from some cameo's but they dont influence the story).This is how the intellectual property should be treated. Just make a good movie and use the rich lore of the Star Wars world as a context, not as a main focus. I think this movie should be seen as a stand-alone product, and not be judged in the light of the dissapointing main movies.In the end this movie provides hope.

" The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films
",0.1531,0.9934,2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try."

They don't care about George Lucas.Just because they own the rights doesn't mean that they can contribute to Star Wars. They own it in name only.

" Lacks in character development, but excels in literally everything else
",0.6956,0.9337,2019-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Overall a very solid and entertaining film. It's a bit weak in character developement, as very few of the characters feel fleshed out (however, Mendelson as Krennic is a pretty good villain in my opinion). However, the film is technically proficient in every way and the special effects are incredible and convincing. All the ships look real and there aren't many shots that look fake, perhaps with the exception of CGI Leia at the very ending scene. There are plenty of action sequences that are a blast to watch, especially the final battle on Scariff, which is a visual joy to behold. Also, the Darth Vader scene at the end is as amazing as everyone says, however brief it is. These are mostly scattered thoughts but overall, I really enjoyed the movie and it's overall pretty damn good and really feels like Star Wars. I probably will give it a 7.5-7.8/10"
" This IS Star Wars. At its best.
",0.1531,-0.7269,2019-11-12 00:00:00,10,"What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars."

I was absolutely blown away by the third act. Whatever pacing issues and plot holes the movie had up to that point, and there were a few, that was a real war movie. Exciting, brutal, fast and merciless. And: No politics. No preaching, no forcing down female force and all that Kennedy agenda down our throats. I don't mind a female hero, as long as she is a person, with some character arc and not perfect at everything she touches from the beginning, looking sharply at you, light saber fighting, force mind tricking, perfect falcon piloting and repairing, Wookiee and droid understanding, swimming, mountain lifting.... etc. Mary Sue Ray.

" My personal favourite Star Wars movie.
",-0.5574,0.9795,2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Granted, I haven't seen the original trilogy in some time, but as of right now this is the best of ALL Star Wars movies for me.I will not go into plotpoints because many other reviews on here do that excellently, but I will rather point out why I love this one so much.And that is because in this movie you can FEEL the stakes. In this one we SEE characters we love die. We see what it took to take down the empire.Our main hero Jyn doesn't get to live. She is a part of the giant picture and a part of what ultimately ends in the emperors demise.Basically all main characters of this movie die.An this is why this movie is so good."
" Lords of the Rebellion.
",-0.128,-0.999,2019-10-30 00:00:00,9,"In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. After Revenge of the Sith came out, it seems that Star Wars as a film series was over. That was until 2012 when George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to the Walt Disney Company for 4 billion dollars and the studio announced that they would be making more films set in the Star Wars universe. One of these films would focus on a group of Rebels stealing the plans to the Death Star. When I first heard about the film, I was quite gritty about it and when the first teaser trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story dropped in April of 2016, I was even more pumped to see it as it appeared that director Gareth Edwards would be taking a more serious approach to the series and give us something in the vein of Saving Private Ryan. Of course, when I did go see the film later that year, I was at first blown away by it but as I thought about it more and more, I began to love it less and upon rewatching it earlier this year in preparation for The Rise of Skywalker, my feelings on the film haven't really changed as while I find Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to be a highly enjoyable film thanks to its action scenes, acting and musical score, some elements of the film leave a lot to be desired in my eyes.The film opens with Imperial scientist Galen Erso hiding with his wife and daughter on the planet Lah'mu where Imperial weapons maker Orson Krennic finds him and begs him to help finish building the Empire's new superweapon, the Darth Star. Galen's wife is killed in the stand-off but his daughter, Jyn, escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera. We then cut to a defective Imperial cargo pilot named Bodi who is captured by Sal's extremist group of rebels on the desert planet of Jedha while carrying a message for Saw. Meanwhile, rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star via another agent and rescues Jyn from an Imperial labor camp and brings her to the Rebel headquarters where Mon Mothma persuades Erso to aid in finding her father so that the Rebel Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Together with Andor and a reprogrammed Imperial droid named K-2SO, they head for Jedha. Now, the trio must find Galen, assemble a rag-tag team and steal the plans to the Death Star before it's too late.What's interesting about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is how the film feels split between two frontiers. On one hand, it's a spectacular war film in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down about a universe that is ensnared in disorder between a plucky rebel alliance and an evil imperial empire. Though the world of space fantasy, Rogue One is able to arouse the viewer with all sorts of fascinating ideas about the battle that is at the core of the Star Wars saga. What would a war in space look like in the 21st century? What is the viewpoint of this massive conflict from outside the cockpit of an X-Wing or the Millennium Falcon by those on the front lines or those people caught in the crossfire? These are just a few of the points that Rogue One focuses on as a war film that so happens to take place in the Star Wars universe.On the other hand, Rogue One does in some ways feel like a bunch of deleted scenes that intend to link the prequel films with the original Star Wars trilogy. The essential idea of Rogue One results in the stealing of the plans for the Death Star that move the plot of A New Hope which in theory should be enough to connect Rogue One to its parent. But much like Solo: A Star War Story, Rogue One feels the need to pepper the screen with various cameos and callbacks to previous Star Wars films in order to pander to the hard-core Star Wars fans. Much like Solo: A Star Wars Story, some of the Easter eggs and callbacks work in the film's favor but others just feel tacked on and don't add anything to the story at hand. So, Rogue One feels imprisoned in-between being a thrilling look at a familiar film series with a new perspective while at the same time feeling a bit too much like Star Wars fan fiction. It's no shock that the war angle of the movie is far more interesting than the fan fiction angle.The most compelling element of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the bold promise of the entire film. With it not being a main chapter in the Star Wars saga, there's a feeling that Rogue One is able to have a bit of fun with one of the most beloved movie franchises ever put to screen. It can acquire the current framework that the previous Star Wars films have built and undo or question what has already been established. Think of a spy film set within the Star Wars universe starring Jyn, Cassian, and K2 or a heist movie on a grand scale. Envision seeing the Star Wars saga without the Jedi and Sith playing a central part in the story. That is the kind of film Rogue One is.Words can not explain how much Star Wars has become engrained into our culture since 1977 and the fact that most of us know the saga inside and out, even the most casual of moviegoers know of the iconic imagery and mythology that the saga has given us over the past 42 years. People who don't go to the movies that much sometimes hum the opening Star Wars theme like a Beatles song. Yoda and Darth Vader are the go-to for Star Wars imitations that are the easiest to read even if the impressions themselves may be awful. So the Star Wars saga is as much apart of our culture as Coca Cola and is something that lends itself to being tampered with. Unlike some people who think the saga should be preserved in glass and put on display, I have always felt that's room in the franchise for improvement and exploring new worlds and characters. Sure, the Star Wars films do invite moviegoers of all ages to admire and be wowed by pure wonder and ask questions but the true delight of watching the saga that George Lucas created is the ability with which a single line of dialog can lead to endless hours of discussion between moviegoers and fans alike. The universe of Star Wars is so vast and endless in scope and yet so flawlessly created. When watching a Star Wars film, it's always fun to picture yourself dancing below the raindrops of continuity or recalling images of a pop art depiction of 2001: A Space Odyssey to Star Wars.Certainly, that was perhaps the best part of the controversial plan by Disney to scarp the Expanded Universe and start over and by doing so, had erased several decades of novels, comics and video games that were built around the films. Now, it must be stressed that what has been tossed out of the new Star Wars canon doesn't mean that the books about Thrawn or Prince Xizor should cease to exist simply because Disney doesn't consider those stories part of their Star Wars universe. The stories are still there and the fans who love those stories can still love them and even Lucasfilm has been using elements of the EU in the more recent comics and TV shows so it's not like the EU has been snapped out of existence. As for me, while I did read some EU stories when I was younger, I never cared for it nor do I care for the new Star Wars canon mostly because I see them both as simply filling in the gaps before, between and after the films. When writing fan-fiction, the urge is to focus on building a universe from the inside instead of the outside as there's always a passion to link every important event or character to a slice of the continuity pie. Taking out all of the material that isn't considered to be apart of the canon allows the creative team to put their own stamp on certain events.There's a ton in Rogue One that works perfectly in that respect. There are quite a few points that Gareth Edwards seems content to set free of the assumptions of a big blockbuster film. Right when it starts, Rogue One gives us a multitude of considerable ritualistic shifts from various tropes found in the other Star Wars films. The opening score sounds much different than the John Williams fanfare that usually opens the other films and there's no title card or text scroll as well as on-screen captions that show the various planets rather than having them explained to us. These departures from what we're used to seeing in the other Star Wars films are small but still critical. Over the course of the first hour of the film, Edwards gives the viewer his own touch to the greater Star Wars universe. This is a film that is steadily rooted in the background characters with none of them being a chosen farm boy or princess but rather mere footnotes in the lager Star Wars universe. In this regard, Rogue One builds upon the storytelling choices that The Force Awakens had already established.At its finest, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gives us a view of the Star Wars universe for the ground floor. The film includes all sorts of classic Star Wars icons but the scoop and scale are so much more massive than what we've seen before. These affairs and clashes seem to happen on multiple levels above the heads of our main characters. The Death Star and the threat it presents itself as are what drives the story with different forms and descriptions of the battle station have shown up in four of the seven Star Wars films, however, Rogue One still finds a way to make the superweapon look intimidating and epic at the same time. The film looks at the Death Star from the surface of Jedha. At one point in the film, the weapon appears over the surface of the planet like a moon while another time, the Death Star places itself as if it's eclipsing the sun. When it does fire its laser, the viewer doesn't see the destruction from the freezing vacuum of space but rather they see"
" A top Star Wars movie
",-0.4215,-0.8118,2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"As far as Star Wars movies go, this is the only one I can honestly say I enjoyed as an adult - the others being the original 3 I watched as a kid but no longer care for.This is what I wish Star Wars movies were all about, rather than the cliche eye-rolling fluffiness that the franchise has mostly produced.
A very brave entry overall that surprised me.
Why? It's ominous and bleak, no 'cute and fun' characters (unless you count the robot drone, who grew on me fast and was a worthy addition), and most importantly, none of the main characters survive this suicide mission of a plot. All those people on the poster... they all die. No one's sugar coating anything here, there's no 'coming back from the dead' type tricks. Now that's space opera cinema I can get on board with."

",0.1531,-0.3539,2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,"This is almost perfect Star Wars. By far the best Star Wars of the new era (including the prequels). Hard to find any fault with it. If only Abrams, Johnson and other took more note of this it might have saved us from some of the faults in those other movies."
" The best of the Disney re makes
",0.6369,-0.1779,2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,This is (in my opinion) the only good disney Star Wars episode so far
" Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon.
",-0.1779,0.9796,2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Really enjoyed this film. The action scenes are good, all the characters are well cast, have depth and are relatable. The scene with Vader at the end is absolutely brilliant, love how it ties into the original trilogy. It's a fantastic story that makes sense while watching, is well paced and had me engaged throughout."
" A refreshing prequel though not the best Star Wars movie, but better than the failed sequel The Force Awakens
",-0.6229,-0.998,2019-10-15 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie when it came out and it was at least mediocre when it came to Star Wars movies, though let's get things straight.First of all, everyone was calm and it wasn't hyped like the Justin Bieber concert known as Ep VII - The Force Awakens that left everyone on Earth and even the natural animals erupting like crazy into thunderous applause.
Yet there was no screaming anywhere or even at the end with this movie.It's better than The Force Awakens, because that was a rehash of the original trilogy.
Now people did say this was really dark for a Star Wars movie, and it was definitely darker than most, but NOTHING like the Force Awakens or even Ep IV - A New Hope (where Alderaan and everyone on it got destroyed), as the 1st Order destroyed the planets with the Starkiller Base killing all the inhabitants.
The Death Star in this was at minimal power and the results were just localized areas being annihilated, like cities and towns.
Yet good characters died in this, but they were NOWHERE near as important as Han Solo, who was killed off by his son Kylo Ren in TFA, traumatizing me and many others.In fact that's the biggest problem with this movie.
All the good characters were killed in this, and that's become an unintended thing in the movie.
Plus there was blood in this multiple times (more times than on Ep III - Revenge of the Sith that's for sure).Yet the 2nd biggest problem was that there were no lightsaber duels, which are a staple in the Star Wars franchise, and if Rogue One had those, it'd be more popular and get better ratings.Another problem was that it failed to warn guests about the filming technique because the camera work was shaky for the majority and looked more like a vlog on the set of Star Wars than a typical movie.
Something that doesn't usually happen in the majority or entirety of a Star Wars movie.
I know it was supposed to be a gritty war movie, so that it would look like live footage of a war, but just think about it.
Imagine watching a 2 hour 13 minute YouTube video/vlog from one of your favorite vloggers who teleported to the Star Wars Galaxy vlogging his/her experience on the planet Scarif or Jeddah.
Yet some people are prone to dizziness and motion sickness, so there should've been warnings about that at the entrance and on tickets.The plot focused on the fact that it took place somewhere between Star Wars Rebels & A New Hope (both after Revenge of the Sith), though near the end, the good guys were trying to save a town and facility on it, before the Death Star came and fired its laser (again at minimal power) on the target, killing off the last good characters in the movie.
Though ironic how the ships near the end moved like bath toys in a tub.Though in the end it felt it was gonna continue leading to the beginning of A New Hope, though it was still different scenery (and Leia was clear in this and nailed her CGI well).Overall it was a MUCH better movie than the Flop Awakens and certainly had great visuals and was a great idea that they decided to make a movie between Star Wars Rebels and A New Hope in the timeline."
" A good prequel for Star Wars though not up to Original Trilogy standards
",-0.3944,-0.9754,2019-10-15 00:00:00,5,"When Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens was released, everyone went crazy and in many theaters around the world went into thunderous applause.
This didn't do any of that when started.When it continued, there was no Star Wars theme song as it's obvious John Williams wasn't composing the scores for this movie.Now for the real thing, the plot and story was a potential for being great as it was hoped to be the best Star wars movie since the Original Trilogy movies.
However all the good characters died.
That's in fact the biggest problem with this movie.The bad guys won in this movie and it was too much and hard to watch all good go away like that.
I mean near the end of the movie, it seemed good was gonna happen, but then it was blasted away by the Death Star.The Death Star in this also used only minimal power, therefore only able to destroy local areas like cities.Now the other parts were pretty good and the visuals were stunning, yet it felt realistic and it was very vivid and detailed.
Yet there was a new perspective on the Death Star, though unfortunately it and many other objects were CGI, proving the downfall of traditional work, which is really hard and artistic.There was lots of violence, MUCH more than your usual Star Wars movie and beat Revenge of the Sith in that matter though NOTHING like The Force Awakens even though they said this would be really dark, though it was PG-13.Yet the camera work was unlike anything ever made in a Star Wars movie before it.
It looks like it was filmed Hunger Games style (I know I'm saying that as those were released around that time) and therefore it was that way for the most of the movie.
Therefore this movie failed to add warnings of motion sickness because you know some people get sick.The ending felt like it would be the beginning of A New Hope, and after all this was a prequel to it.
Though Princess Leia (from Carrie Fisher which btw R.I.P.) was entirely CGI and so was Grand Moff Tarkin.
I know this was made 39 years after A New Hope but this was just insane.This movie had good and bad moments, and I would've given it 8 stars if it weren't for all the good characters being killed."

" The Best
",0.6369,0.1531,2019-10-08 00:00:00,9,Rogue one is the Best of all Star Wars movies even its only side story
" A pleasant surprise.
",0.6597,-0.8636,2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"What's this? Can it be? A STAR WARS prequel that's actually -- GASP! -- great? Believe it or not, yes. Although technically not a prequel -- it's more of a spin-off ""anthology"" movie -- ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY could very well qualify. It's easily superior to the prequel trilogy (even REVENGE OF THE SITH, good as it was, was held back by flaws, none of which exist here, thankfully). While not necessarily a better made film than THE FORCE AWAKENS, I actually enjoyed ROGUE ONE a lot more than I thought I would. Which was not something I was expecting to say.But ROGUE ONE works as both a movie and a bridge to the opening moments of the first STAR WARS movie (rebranded as EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE). It's also one of the few STAR WARS movies to actually show the tragedies of going into war -- something that we have not seen from entries in this galactic saga. A new cast of characters propels this tale, of which K-2SO is easily the most successful. Voiced by Alan Tudyk, this droid is very much in the vein of C-3PO, what with his deadpan, dry humor and prissy personality. He's also very badass -- can you name a scene in which C-3PO wielded a blaster to save his colleagues? No. The fact that this robot does makes him a very memorable newcomer.The most surprising moment of the movie is the return of Death Star Governor Grand Moff Tarkin, as portrayed by Peter Cushing in A New Hope. Apparently CGI was used to make this possible, but honestly, I'd be hard-pressed to know if it were, because the onscreen results are convincingly real. Since the actor has now passed, Stephen Stanton supplies the motion capture work for him. His voice is supplied by Guy Henry, who does a dead-on job of impersonating the character's chilling mannerisms. (The same is true of a surprise cameo at the very end of the film -- you'll have to see for yourself to find out.)The real jewel is the return of Darth Vader, complete with James Earl Jones' unmistakable baritone. Unlike the prequels, we get to see this iconic villain as his usual nasty self, berating an Empire leader one moment, and at the climax, slashing at rebels with his familiar crimson lighter. Although his appearance is brief, he is still the highlight of ROGUE ONE. In fact, the last thirty minutes are where this movie really dazzles.Fault-wise, ROGUE ONE has very little to speak of, other than the fact that it starts off somewhat slowly and occasionally dips into lulls. However, performances across the board are very well done all around (a commendable feature of these Disney-produced STAR WARS movies), and while their characters don't register with us in the same emotional way as Luke Skywalker and company did, they are at the very least soulful and believable characters as opposed to anyone in the prequels. And of course, as usual, the visual effects are of the same standard we've come to expect from the STAR WARS trilogy. It's refreshing to have this movie refrain from overusing computer graphics except for necessary purposes.One could easily ditch one of the STAR WARS prequels and replace ROGUE ONE with the one in question. This movie really is that good."

Without comment, a blind Kung Fu teacher in this saga? It doesn't even stick with a tail. What's up, that the screenwriter is a fan of the old films of Jackie Chan and Jet Li?The only change is that this movie is conceived more like a war story, focusing on the battle between the Imperials and the Republicans, but it is not even there that it has emotion, the Imperials shoot three hundred shots and do not hit a rebel, the rebels hit four shots and they take them all down, that's all the thrill of battle the movie sells. Depressing.To all this this is very long and it becomes infinite, because they have to be so long ?, If there is not even an argument or what is happening or what happens, you do not know anything you only see ships, shooting jokes without No grace and pointless follies.

",0.6597,-0.7886,2019-09-14 00:00:00,9,"Not sure whether it posted or not, but I wrote a positive review a few days ago and watched Rogue One again since then and I respect it even more. RE watchability is a sign of a great work. Mediocre oeuvres almost always lose their shine after repeated experiences.
One negative remark then all positive. It's an epidemic in movies today that important lines or character introductions receive muddled and often muddied treatment. At home, one can repeat or use subtitles, but in the cinema if one doesn't understand a line because the actor raced through it or the sound guys added so much atmosphere noise that the viewer missed info. This combined with Star Wars tendency to cast guys with thick accents means the first time viewer may be wondering what's going on. The names are fanciful and unfamiliar and then the movie often lacks scenes firmly establishing identities. I know some hate when exposition is too obvious, but it's their job to find graceful ways to do it. Characters are talking about Cassian and I had no idea who he was until much later cuz I don't remember the ID scene. Maybe it's there and I'll see it the 3rd time. I saw Star Wars in 1977 and I understood what was going on, and I was an easily distracted kid. Very different with Rogue One: Riz Ahmed raced through his crucial lines about being an Imperial pilot defector with plans to hand over to Saw so fast, I had to rewind.
I don't watch nearly a many movies as most folks, but I see enough to know I'm sick of CGI. Rogue One had just the right amount and use. It was never annoying or excessive IMO. My first review stated I wish for a better score. The second time I listened more carefully realizing Michael Giacchino was responsible and I have great respect for him. I think he could have equaled or rivaled John Williams ,but I suspect he may have held back. Just a theory, No factual basis.
I miss the cast. I so wish they didn't have to die. I remember not giving a s--t whether Qui Gon? Liam Neeson died. I still don't care about Re or Kylo, but I hated to see this bunch of heros die. I like them a lot more than the people in the other Disney StarWars films.Their humor and lack of stiffness recalled the rapport entre les i.e. the rapport among the '77-'83 cast."

Still, this movie comes off a bit bland. Having seen it, I didn't find it nearly as memorable as any of the other movies in the Star Wars franchise. It's just a fun one-time watch, and something I don't think I will try to see again, or buy on bluray, despite owning the entire Star Wars franchise on it. It's fine. Just a little sideline story that should have come out much sooner for it to be relevant. If you like Star Wars, watch it. You won't regret it, but it's not quite as good as getting a full-on sequel."

",0.0,-0.6985,2019-08-07 00:00:00,2,"Rogue One was so boring, I fell asleep 2 times before being able to watch it all. I hated this movie. But at least unlike The Last Jedi, it didn't crap all over the first 6 SW films.Jyn, Cassian and the gang were not memorable or interesting, except for the blind guy. Whittaker & Mikkelsen were criminally underused in their roles.
The best parts of Rogue One were K2SO, the over the top & wonderfully hammy villain, Krennic, and the final Vader scene. As a Vader fan, however, I was disappointed with the Mustafar scene, as it looked nothing like Hell-planet it did in RotS. And Vader's dad joke was so cringy. It's blasphemous to say this, but James Earl Jones's voice is too old for Vader. It may be age, or dentures, but he did not sound menacing in the least. CGI Tarkin sounded scarier.I know I'm in the minority, but this was not a good movie. It came off as bad fan fiction."
" Boring Cash Grab that lacks the soul of the franchise.
",-0.3182,0.7681,2019-07-29 00:00:00,3,"I don't understand the positive reviews for this SW film? The characters, plot, dialogue, well, everything is slow, uninteresting, and dried out. The robot was the only character with any personality. I was happy to see these boring characters die off at the end. I've never fell asleep in a movie but I literally dozed off 20minutes into this expensive snooze fest. The fact that I think takes me off is that they shot it digitally (didn't use 35mm film) which breaks continuity AND they did not use an opening crawl. I don't care if this is a spin-off, it's Star Wars rules must be followed or it doesn't work. This film is a sacrelig to the franchise and has about as much soul as a piece of wet cardboard drying out in the sun. If you're a true fan of this series, stay away from this pile of junk that wants to cash in on fan boy service by being all serious and I guess ""adult."" Yeah throwing the Vader slaughter in there was cool but looks like something that belongs in a video game not a motion picture."

Love all the scene on Jeda with the Rebel's attack the tank and the At-St. The Bodi Rooke side plot is annoying and kinda confusing first or second watch. Some parts of the second act can kinda drag but it is all worth it for the especially awesome 3rd act Battle Of Scarif. The Battle of Scarif is everything I want from a Star Wars battle in a movie. Space battles with Rebels attacking the planet gate, to ship battles in the air of Scarif, to the awesome ground battles with Rebels on the ground near the Citadel tower. I love new Star Wars ships and troopers and stuff like that and this movie gives you plenty of that with stand outs include Shore trooper, Tie Striker, Combat Assault Tank, U-wing, At-Act, and Death Troopers.

",0.1531,0.9581,2019-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I was awed, spellbound, moved and impressed. This movie did what none of the other recent Star Wars films have done. It was one of the best told stories in film that I have seen in a long time, but it also just happens to fit in the Star Wars universe. Like the Force Awakens I felt like it borrowed heavily from Miyazaki films (growth of a young female scavenger discarded by society and forced to live in a world of war that is beyond her power, epic worlds and beautiful visuals, heavy thematics with a focus on environmental impact). And the pace of the story increases and accelerates to a perfect crescendo and ending. I loved every minute of it.I will say I did miss the crawl during the credits but that's really a small quip. But what I didn't miss were the clever winks and nods to fans of the newest Star Wars films. The plot is very dire and grim at times and it doesn't hold back from being emotionally heavy. The action sequences were gripping and the characters were morally ambiguous at first. I thought all of it was very well polished and the final third was breathtaking. One of the greatest war/action/sci fi films ever made in my opinion. Fantastic."

Quite possibly the best looking Star Wars film while still telling a compelling war story that feels more like a World War 2 film set in space. Rogue One definitely gives us a deep feel for what the actual war in Star Wars is like, something that only the Clone Wars series had done before. It also features compelling characters who are all flawed yet sympathetic because of the various situations each is thrown into. Also do not forget a fantastic performance by Ben Mendelsohn as the villain! All of these things lead to a terrific climax of a finale to put an exclamation point on what is the best Star Wars film."

As for the graphic-visual design of the film, I can say with certainty that it is of a superior quality to other deliveries, just incredible, both in its presentation and execution. But the movie doesn't stop there.It is an entertaining movie, full of tense moments of action and exciting scenes.

Gareth Edwards did a fantastic job with all the grittyness, (space-)battles and despair and the many small references to the classic trilogy as well as the logical lead to A New Hope. Finally the two meter wide exhaust port makes sense.
It's a pity that Edwards seems not to be considered for any other new Star Wars projects. Now I have to build a Blue Squadron costume for the Rebel Legion! :-) as well."
" Shot amazingly
",0.0,0.9332,2019-06-15 00:00:00,9,"The cinematography is amazing. But not in the way that other films like blade runner are. It looks like it was shot in 1977, which in any other film would show a lack of quality if it doesn't look ""modern"" but my God they put so much effort into making it look like it was part of the A New Hope timeline, which I imagine would be constricting but feels so natrual, so much so that you don't even notice it but it makes it so much better.
To quote Futurama. ""When you've done something right people won't know you've done anything at all.""
It fits in with the Star Wars legacy so well while being something fresh and different so you know it's not part of the main saga. I originally hated the fact that it doesn't have the main roll and it has labels for the planets, which makes it more Star Trek than Star Wars, but on a second viewing it doe a great way of separating itself from the Saga.
Only thing that brings it down is I didn't feel that emotionally attached to the characters as much as I wanted to be."
" Best Surprise Ever
",0.743,-0.9912,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Imagine a tiny film made by unknowns, starring mostly unknowns that becomes one of top grossing films in history?
Darth Vader, James Earl Jones reprising his voice role, chilling, Mustafar thrilling, Vader in his tank, the lava lake reservoir Citadel, the place where Obi Wan left him hacked and burned, but now the source of his spiritual strength, read Darth Vader comics by Charles Soule, issues 20-25, watch Star Wars Rebels and Clone War cartoons to learn about Mustafar and its link to the eternal, and lastly a mostly disregarded comic by an unpopular author called Darth Vader annual 2 that came out last year which is the prequel to this prequel it's the story of Darth Vader, director krennic, Governor Tarkin and Geonosis and how that all connects because an entire new world of Star Wars comes with Rogue One, that's how good this film is.
Felicity Jones is so good in this role the rest of the cast also terrific, the male lead from Mexico his accent is so thick that it made some of his lines unintelligible that's really my only flaw in the film and that we don't get more Vader and Tarkin.
The scenes on Jeddha, don't miss the Jedi mountains lying alk over Jeddha, the destructive power of the Death Star, that travels in hyperspace, the sacrifices on Scariff, terrible tragedy in Jyn's family all make this a true tearjerker and it's also an action adventure Thriller the Space Battles the battle with the planets force field on Scariff, all of this is just A+ material and it's much better than the last Jedi, The Last Jedi and even Solo, neither are as good as this film, this film becomes Maybe the second best Star Wars movie after Empire Strikes Back although I love the prequels I think they get a lot of bad press just because people who don't know anything about Star Wars shoot off their mouths remember the prequels are really George Lucas's Opus where he lays out the real Canon of Star Wars.
The final 20 minutes of the movie when you realize things aren't going well and the final scene with Darth Vader might be one of the best scenes in Star Wars history the fear the awesome power of the force used by Darth Vader against those troops and the clever use of actual footage of Carrie Fisher at the very end, it's a real tear-jerker and now we know exactly what the crawl in episode 4 is all about when you read the crawl in a New Hope they're describing this film you always took it for granted that somebody showed up with the plans for the Death Star, Rogue One a Star Wars Story finally tells us exactly how we got those plans and what terrible cost.

Especially with the film being helmed by Gareth Edwards. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, special effects, screenplay, editing, score and acting. It's an action packed thrilling ride. All the actors portray interesting, captivating and remarkable characters. The plot revolves around the origins of the Evil Empire's most feared and devastating weapon, the Death Star, and tells the journey that is taken to destroy it's completion.

",0.0,0.6896,2019-04-24 00:00:00,8,I am sad to say I have only recently watched this movie as when it was released I heard nothing but negative things about but after watching it on Blu Ray years past its release I regret not giving a chance sooner.The movie is a prequel to Episode IV A New Hope and the story of how the death star got built and how the flaw in its design came to be and how the rebels came to possess the information the story on paper doesn't sound groundbreaking but it is honestly very good as it sets the stage for the original trilogy.This is look into the other side of the Star Wars universe putting the Jedi aside and focusing more on the rebels who turned the tide of war against the empire which isn't something we see a lot in Star Wars.The movie is very well shot and plays on the strengths of the Star Wars Universe with even with an all new cast of characters we have never seen before you feel at home in this movie the battles and effects are well done making this movie look and sound incredible.I urge anyone who is a Star Wars fan to watch this movie it truly is a worthy entry in such a beloved franchise and will not disappoint you despite what others say.

And what a pace it is. The ending that builds is one of the best battle scenes followed by a link ending which is a nostalgic tribute to A New Hope beginning.The droid was so good and funny. The rebels were acted well by characters that seemed like genuine people fighting for a cause. That 'Darth Vader scene'. The blasts from the past (tbh I wasn't a fan of the CGI characters). The ending of endings. This film encapsulates the Star Wars universe far better than any of the prequels.This is what a Star Wars universe film should be.

" Some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series
",0.1531,0.946,2019-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is directed by Gareth Edwards and takes place between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars series. This film is highly entertaining, as it contains some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series. At moments the CGI is jaw dropping. Visually this movie is great. Also the storyline is quite interesting, as explains unknown information which leads to what occurs in episode 4. The characters were likeable and well acted, although they were not given enough depth. The audience knows little to nothing about most characters and it really makes it hard to connect and feel for them at times. Also the score by Michael Giacchino sounds a little rushed at times as he was only given 4 weeks to write the music. I feel that there could have been more creative sounds based around the themes by John Williams. Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One.

",0.1531,0.3962,2019-04-01 00:00:00,9,"After the disaster that was the Last Jedi and with the entire ""new"" trilogy in shambles Rogue One is now clearly the best Star Wars movie of the Disney Era.
The movie is really quite good especially the final third of the movie which has most of the action."
" Good movie, maybe not great for Star Wars though.
",-0.6116,-0.9802,2019-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Unpopular opinion for a longtime Star Wars fan, but I thought this movie was unnecessary and underwhelming.
Jyn Erso is almost an entirely blank character.
Cassian is fine. Nothing more to say.
K2SO was good. I despise ""jokes"" in star wars movies, but comedy is completely welcome.
Chirrut, Baze, and the Temple of Kyber change the entire lore around the Jedi, Lightsabers, and Kyber Crystals in a way that I thought was far more simplistic and far worse than the original lore. However, I did enjoy both characters, despite all of that.
'Director' Krennic is a generic imperial dude that holds a rank that nobody has ever really seen in the old movies, the old EU, or the new stuff, and it's unclear how high that rank actually is. He is intimidating and very believable. The rank-related gripe is all the negative I have for him.
Vader is 100% Vader in this movie and is therefore above reproach.
Saw Gerrera is MUCH older than when we last saw him, even though that was only like 20-25 years ago in-universe. It's a little jarring, but Forrest Whittaker plays the grizzled old warrior phenomenally. ""Bor Gullet will know the truth!"" However, it was really stupid that he didn't get on the ship and instead chose to get killed by a Tsunami of sand. ""I'm done running."" What the hell is this going to accomplish? Are you going to fight the mountain that's about to hit you? Just get on the dang ship.
The fight scene at the end threw a wrench into the banter between Vader and Leia in ANH. Her ship clearly participated in the battle. It's not like they jumped in and jumped out. Also, wasn't the ship supposed to recieve a transmission? Because they brought a physical disk on board. That's not the same thing.
Overall it was a good movie, but maybe not great for Star Wars."
" Over 1 bln dollars in sales...

The series has become heavily monopolised and not at all what George Lucas' vision of Star Wars once was. Such a shame. In saying that, the special effects and every other element of an ideal film were there."
" A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars.
",0.2263,0.8331,2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Years ago, when Disney acquired Lucasfilm, I had worried that they would ruin one of the most beloved sci-fi franchises ever to grace the big screen. That being said, Lucasfilm's prequel trilogy showed us all how it could happen. Around the same time, I started to notice the quality of Disney's animated fare was drastically improving, even outpacing Pixar. The proof to finally win me over was the way they have expertly handled the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With all this in mind, I was curious how this side-story to the main Star Wars saga would play out.First off, anyone worth their salt in nerd-cred knows that the original Star Wars is based off samurai films. Gareth Edwards (who directed the Godzilla (2014) reboot) certainly made this influence obvious in Rouge One, especially in the opening sequence and with the inclusion of a Zatoichi-like blind swordsman. At this point, all he needed was to add in the ""war"" to Star Wars, and suddenly we have a gritty plot that ends exactly how those who have seen A New Hope (1977) expect it to. In fact, there were moments where these scenes could have been the beaches of Normandy or the jungles of Vietnam, it was so easy to see the references.While I found many of the characters to be somewhat one-dimensional (since their main objectives were either survival, duty or revenge), I did appreciate the scene-stealing K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) to lighten the otherwise oppressive mood of the plot. Visually speaking, the battle sequences (especially in space) were phenomenal, and the first firing of the Death Star was a fantastic scene embedded in my memory for its sheer awesomeness. Even so, the CGI Governor Tarkin was still on the edge of the uncanny valley, even if it was on the more realistic side.A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars, I give Rouge One 3.5 stars out of 5."

As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it.
" Fantastic spinoff
",0.5574,0.6345,2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Gareth Edward's entry into the Star Wars universe with his spin-off 'Rogue One' is a bold move, getting rid of the Skywalker family completely. In place of them are a group of unmemorable characters who are an exciting story filled with many callbacks and use of nostalgia. 'Rogue One' is a very good Star Wars film, with an exciting score by Michael Giacchino, and a creative fun 'Saving Private Ryan' take on Star Wars, showing the war aspect of the saga. The comedy in this film works with the main cast and the fight scenes are very well done, and the acting is very good among most of the main cast. The only fault I see with this installment is the lack of reason to care for any of the main characters other than our main heroine. The film introduces these characters very quickly and gives them a quick sad story. It will be difficult to walk away from this film saying that you remembered all of the main characters names. However this is a stand-alone, regardless still manages to be a fun Star Wars flick."
" Emotion , thrills , noisy action , super-spectacle and impressive aerial combat effects
",0.4019,-0.9768,2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Set after the rise of the Galactic Empire in Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and before the Battle of Yavin in Star Wars (1977) .
In a short time period right before the events of A New Hope , we find ourselves in the middle of a galactic war between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire .The synopsis of this film starts in the entire opening crawl with the traditional text from Star wars (1977) : A long time ago in a Galaxy far , far away . It is a period of civil war with rebel spaceships....but instantly leaps to the action . No long opening crawl . In fact , this film is set days before the events of Star wars . It follows the outcast Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and how she came to join the Rebel Alliance in a dangerous move to steal the Death Star plans . Her kidnapped dad Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) has built a terrifying super-weapon : The Death Star that contains kyber crystals and revealed to be used as fuel for it , it is a battle station capable of destroying an entire planet . With a desperate goal of saving her daddy from the Empire and retrieving the secret plans for the weapon of mass destruction : The Death Star, we follow a group of rebel spies (Felicity Jones , Diego Luna as Cassian Andor , Donnie Yen as Chirrut Îmwe , Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus , Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook) and including the ordinary robot : K-2SO (voice : Alan Tudyk) , an Imperial enforcer droid who's been re-purposed to work for the rebellion. All of them have hope to restore peace to the Galaxy , being commanded by the high staff (Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa , Fares Fares as Senator Vaspar , Alistair Petrie as General Draven , Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma , Ben Daniels as General Merrick , Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna) and to vanquish Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and other empire enemies as well as eliminate the destructive super-weapon or it will be too late . A risky rebellion built on hope . Save the Rebellion. Save the dream.Delightful follow-up to the trilogy that George Lucas always said was intented to be for children . However , because of its imagination , scale , spectacularity , and style , it results to be a fabulous entertainment for all ; both , kiddies and adults . Interesting and engaging screenplay by Chris Weitz , Tony Gilroy from a story by John Knoll , and based on characters created by George Lucas . And being the first Stars Wars franchise to introduce location on-screen caption . Some marvellous new creations , especially state-of-art robots , and the unbeatable special effects more than make up for a slighly overlong movie . Although it is more a spin-off than a sequel , it is more different and original than its predecessors ; if it's no less enjoyable or uplifting . To wonder at the way in which heroes and heroines steer their aircrafts and fall off in high-speed against the large enemy crafts . And the breathtaking dogfighting and overwhelming piloting at the end restore it to the realm of super-spectacle to which it belongs . Felicity Jones is acceptable as Jyn Erso joining the Alliance, Jyn finds herself in the middle of the ultimate conflict between the Rebels and the Empire as well as to cripple a super-weapon . She is well accompanied by an enjoyable support cast , such as : Forest Whitaker , Riz Ahmed , Mads Mikkelsen , Jimmy Smits ,Genevieve O'Reilly and many others . Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing in Star wars is now played by Guy Henry with a CGI replica of Cushing's face superimposed over his . And special appearance by Darth Vader , voice: James Earl Jones, who is meticulously patterned after his look in the original ""Star Wars"". And Carrie Fisher-CGI Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher) who is asked what the plans mean and she answers , ""Hope,"" signaling the start of the first Star Wars film... Star Wars (1977) . However , Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Drewe Henley (Red Leader) all passed away in 2016.It displays an attractive production design , over-the-top scenarios , appropriate photography and adequate costuming , as costume designer David Crossman stated that some of the original costumes used in Star wars (1977), The empire strikes back (1980) and The return of the Jedi (1983) were reused here . It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Greig Fraser And rousing musical score from Michael Giacchino , taking parts of original soundtrack by the classy John Williams ; Michael has composed every film directed by J.J. Abrams except Star wars episode VII , though composer Alexandre Desplat's original score was rejected . Michael Giacchino, his replacement, had only one month to write his musical score. The motion picture was well directed by Gareth Edwards who exposed their three of his influences for film-making are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino. He has made succesful films , as the hit of ""Monsters"" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"", being produced by Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, directing the successful ""Godzilla¨ . Finally directed this ¨Rogue one¨, a tremendous box office hit smash , grossing a lot of money worldwide ."

",0.7412,0.9973,2019-02-10 00:00:00,9,"BLOWN AWAY is what comes to mind with Rogue One as yes i grew up on the Star wars franchise but this movie is a more grown up & darker in tone & actually gritty & a real sense of danger so to me it's actually as great as the classic's.
My personal favourite Star Wars movie.The group of rebels are excellent & the story is exciting & dangerous so the atmosphere is very dark & often emotional!!!
A fantastic sci-fi Thriller not just a great star wars movie as this is a brilliant sci-fi film that's excellently directed & it looks amazing.
Rogue One stands out as easily the best of the franchise, yes even better than the original Trilogy, here this movie feels like a War film or a mission movie which it is both & has a dark overall atmosphere. I love men-on-a-mission movies or ladies & gents-on-a-mission such as DC's Suicide Squad & Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds or Black Hawk Down or Triple Frontier among many others & Rogue One fits in perfectly to that sub-genre.
The battle scenes are fast, frantic & furious with gritty impact like a battle would be like & for a fantasy sci-fi Thriller it's one exciting & at times emotional wild ride.
The cast is great as is each interesting character & performances especially from Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, a daring freedom fighter & the heart & soul of the movie & Diego Luna as Cassian Andor the rebel spy & they with the others band together to go on a desperate & danger mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, which is the prequel story to the very first ""New Hope""
Yes the other movies are of course iconic classic's but this is an instant CLASSIC & a brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure/Thriller with meaning & a much more urgent excitement feel to it & in my opinion a better more grown up star wars film & a perfect film in the franchise. A deadly Suicide mission & an exciting journey."

Seriously; watch this movie with mystic eyes and the universe will be one but whole.
Still, despite being just a plot device to fix a major gaping plot hole of the original trilogy, this is one of the most coherent star wars movies to date. Granted that, at this point, no one should really expect good story telling from a star wars movie! So, watch it as mindless fun, as it is meant to be. Star wars is fantasy more than science fiction after all. You'll be rewarded with interesting enough characters that you will not see ever again and with a story so unbelievable, another couple of movies will be made to fix the plot holes of this one.

Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you."

" A darker, different, and ultimately brillaint take on the Star Wars universe
",-0.5574,-0.918,2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"The characters in this film do not start out heroes. They are legends of the rebellion by the end of the film. The choices they make are what makes them heroes, making this the most realistic hero story in this universe: and the gritty realism of the characters doesnt dampen the fun star wars atmosphere. This band of characters are ultimately likeable, especially Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe and Alan Tudik's K2SO. The feel of them all working out together in the end is remniscient of 2012's Avengers Assemble. And when people say this is a war movie, they are right. This movie's action scenes go out of thier way to show you the distress and horror of war, even giving a few emotional seconds to random soldiers on the battlefield. The film shows how the rebellion's attacks, however justified, are dangerous and horrific for the people involved and the bystanders, and shows the extremism that comes with rebellion. I personally love the darker and grittier take on the rebellion- empire war. The music by michael giaccino is something to behold. In the emotional scenes, particularly the peak final one, the music makes the moment and very nearly brought me to tears. And fear not, as this is a seperate story, it ties in excellently and neccessarily to old favourites like Tarkin, Darth Vader (who gets an amazing action scene at the end) and Mustafar.
Overall, this is not a pointless entry to the star wars universe, but in fact my 3rd favourite yet."

" Darker But More or Less of the Same
",0.0,-0.9025,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"26 December 2016. Without giving too much away, consider the dilemma of trying to tie in a prequel to the original Star Wars movie, and you'll get some of the darkness that this movie might entail. Missing are all the epic, royal court melodrama and trappings of the Empire. The audience only gets flashes of what is about too come, almost not enough. The beginning is a hodgepodge of flittering scenes that almost require a voice-over to explain what is going on along with a loud musical score to retain audience interest in these initial less than spectacular scenes.What this episode attempts to present is a substantive storyline about sacrifice, parent-child loyalty, betrayal, and most of all ""hope"". There is no Harrison Ford persona to capture theater replaced by an evolving one in the form of a young girl transforming into a young adult. Overall, this episode is more about terror and rebelling against it at small odds and a lot of shooting, explosions, and killing, and dying. The premise that the larger the better as is profoundly used in this movie, may not always be better than the quality of the story."
" Hits the spot which The Force Awakens missed
",-0.296,-0.8527,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Not only is this film good in itself and fully respecting the the lore of everything before it, it ties into Episode 4 literally seamlessly and actually fixes plot holes (or at least open questions) from Episode 4 - i.e. Why the Death Star had a design flaw and why there was only one copy of the Death Star plans. This is really where TFA misses the mark...and where TLJ turned up to the wrong archery tournament two weeks late with a set of golf clubs.The characters and acting are great, the story line makes sense and the tension is held at the right level all the way through the film.The fact that it ends up being a suicide mission, has drier sense of humour than we're used to and the rebellion is portrayed as being ruthless when necessary means that it's not so suitable for younger viewers, but that's no complaint.I would say an 8 is a bit high for this as a stand-alone film, but fitting any new film into the existing Star Wars universe introduces constraints, and when those constraints are handled this well, it deserves some credit.All in all, if Disney could churn one of these out each year or two, the fans would keep coming, and I would die a happy man."
" Rogue One is what the Star Wars saga can boast of itself
",-0.5574,-0.9961,2019-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Well after a long time I finally got my hands on first Star Wars anthology film that is Rogue One. Being a cinephile I simply couldn't control my excitement to begin with all those teaser-trailer stuff and jumped onto the Star Wars saga and what I saw can be summarised in a single word that is ""amazing"". Yes you heard it right, ""amazing"" is the term which is best suited for Rogue One. Finally after a long time I can confidently state that this movie is a well crafted peice of art to find its way under Star Wars belt. Gareth Edwards has done an impressive job by directing this film and in my opinion he should have been given a Star Wars trilogy of his own to direct. Rogue One like every great movie has its own sets of strengths and flaws which are discussed below.
First lets begin with the strength:
1. Story- Rogue One being an anthology film is something that perfectly fills in the void between the Revenge of Sith and A New Hope. It brilliantly bridges the gap between these two movies. Story is engaging, interesting and on the same hand has strong essence of emotion that creates a lasting impact on your mind. Infact it is one of those trademark star wars film in which emotional part takes the upper hand.
2. Screenplay- as I have stated earlier Gareth Edwards has done an amazing job which can be seen here.
3. Characters - a lot of people have stated the lack of character development as weakness of this movie. But in my opinion the lack of character development is more overshadowed by some really great characters that are introduced in this film and have the calibre to be remembered for a long time in the entire Star Wars Saga. Characters like chirrut imuwe, cassian, bodhi and K-2SO are simply among the best characters of star wars till date.
4. BGM - background music of movie as usual is good and syncs well with the situation. Infact the signature soundtrack of star wars can leave your heart brimming up with emotions during and after the film.
5. Visuals - visuals and CGI are one of the best part of the film. Though some people criticized the use of CGI to create General Tarkin and Leia Organa but according to me if you see it in another way that shows the hardwork done by the director and his efforts to make this film a treat for star wars audience. The film consists of some of the best war scenes between Rebel alliance and Empire along with the bunch of believers that strive to make this rebellion a success.
Now lets come to the flaws:
1. Opening Crawl - this is the first star wars film till date that has no opening crawl in the beginning along with trademark music of John Williams that used to grab the attention of audience from the very first scene reminding them of the tension brewing in galaxy (which I think is the most important as we come to know that what actually happened after the last star wars film ended and what is the situation in galaxy now)and that they are watching no ordinary scene but a Star Wars film.
2. Another problem is with the potrayal of Darth Vader. The scene in which the Vader is introduced in the film, he seemed to be a bit off from the Vader we are used to see in the previous star wars movie. Though the light saber battle involving Vader on spaceship during climax is one of the best Vader scenes I have seen till date (trust me it is intense), still the potrayal of Vader in his introduction scene is a bit weak which I think is a injustice done to the character of one of the most dangerous villains of galaxy.
3. Another thing that I would regard as downpoint is that the character of Galen Erso and Saw Garrera should have been given more screen time. They were killed off soon without some significant contribution to the story. Though Galen Erso builds a flaw in Death Star which enables rebels to destroy it still his character was off-screen the entire time and on-screen he died sooner he made his appearance in front of general. Saw garrera's character should also have been given more of screen presence as it was played by a prominent actor and his death was not an essential requirement of story.
4. This is first star war film in years where there is no jedi and no trademark light saber battles between dark force and bright side. Though it was important for the story but conflict of jedis is something I always look towards in a star wars film. Though there is light sabee batter involving Vader but it is a small scene against rebel soldiers and not some light saber wielding jedi.
In the end after pondering over all the strengths and weakness in the film I will conclude the Rogue One is one of the best star wars film ever made after original trilogy and had the capability to be the best one if some flaws were eradicated. But still I will regard it as an amazing star wars saga in years a film that has completely worthy of its inclusion in your must watch films list and my favourite star wars film after the original trilogy in star wars cinematic universe."
" Rogue One: A Worthless Story
",-0.4404,-0.9989,2019-01-08 00:00:00,3,"As is customary when reviewing a Star Wars movie, I am obligated to begin by explaining my own connection to the franchise. I love Star Wars, but I am of the opinion that George Lucas' six-part saga is the only story worth mentioning in the cinematic history of the franchise. I find the post-Lucas sequels to be a disgusting affront to what is left of artistic originality and creativity in Hollywood. A hostile corporate takeover of what was essentially a uniquely auteur piece of pop art. I am against Disney/Lucasfilm's fan fiction on principle, but that doesn't mean I can't still enjoy it for what it is; Disposable science fiction action with a Star Wars branded coat of paint. That is especially the case with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Unlike its big Disney brothers, Rogue One doesn't try to pretend to be part of the same ongoing saga. Instead, it does what I might've hoped Disney's fan fiction would; fill in the gaps with a unique, smaller scale trifle whose purpose is only to entertain. Still, even with tempered expectations, I got little out of Rogue One. The sad fact is, this is a bad movie, littered with terrible decision after terrible decision, leading to a trite waste of the Star Wars name.Rogue One is a different kind of ""Star Wars Story"". As a tangential ""one-off"" story about a group of Rebels only mentioned in A New Hope and their mission to capture the plans to the original Death Star, Rogue One is not aiming to be a new chapter in the saga. It is more like an attempt to recreate Marvel's reliable pattern of standalone films that bolster the ""main storyline"". And like those films, it feels unashamedly manufactured. There is a lot of heavy speeches and overblown melodrama, but really, this movie is only superficially ""big"". The story is small-scale all the way through; A tension-free, low-stakes, TV-style lark for action buffs. And all of this is despite the fact that director Gareth Edwards pulls out all the visual stops to make Rogue One feel like a war epic.I understand that Rogue One wants to be a war epic, but the visual style of the film, for the most part, is a major disadvantage. Edwards does scale well, and the extended, multi-layered battle that takes up the film's last half hour is pretty spectacular. It's everything else that took me out of the experience. Edwards and DP Greig Fraser are obsessed with close-up, out of focus, handheld camera work, and the film's color palette is disgustingly drab. With the exception of that final battle (which takes place on a beautiful tropical military base), Rogue One is awful to look at; closer to a moody TV ad than an epic war movie. The visual style is a major miscalculation, but it is one of many.Most notably misjudged are the characters. From the writing to the casting to the acting, this thing is a disaster when it comes to portraying people we are supposed to care about. Felicity Jones plays the protagonist, Jyn Erso, an insipid take on the lazy ""orphan-turned-leader"" formula that gave us Rey. She meets, among others, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, and Riz Ahmed. I don't find any of these actors particularly appealing regardless, but all of them give bad performances here. Whitaker makes some truly bizarre decisions as a Rebel extremist, and Jones is even worse. Her face lacks anything but a blank, detached, dopiness, and when she is forced to give grandiose rallying cries, it's impossible to not roll your eyes. The only one in the whole cast that comes out relatively unscathed is Donnie Yen as a blind wannabe Jedi with a pointy stick.There is not much keeping Rogue One from being a mildly enjoyable sci-fi action flick. The story, as trivial as it is, is enough to hang some battles on and call it a day. This film should have been, at least, exciting. The final battle is, but the journey there is filled with far too many ridiculous errors in judgement. For all the production designs and cutting-edge CGI, Rogue One can't keep from shooting itself in the foot. The characters stink. The cinematography stinks. The dialogue stinks. If these aspects were merely tolerable, the action (directed quite well by Edwards) might have been fun. But there is so much that is not tolerable, so many distractingly bad elements, that it is hard to lose yourself in the battles. Even when Darth Vader shows up at the end, I could only get partially giddy. If you must exploit the Star Wars name, it has to be more worthwhile than this.35/100"

" New hope...
",0.0,0.9925,2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie which is also a prequel of Star Wars in which we watch a desperate mission of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. The mission's goal is to steal the plans of a new super weapon that the Empire has, the Death Star. Since we already knew that Princess Leigh had the Death Star plans, we will now watch how she got them and what exactly happen.I liked very much this movie because it had an amazingly interesting plot with many plot twists that I couldn't even imagine. Since I had already watched all the previous Star Wars movies I had some questions and one of those questions was how Princess Leigh had the Death Star plans, and in this movie, this big question is explained. Regarding the direction which was made by Gareth Edwards, it was simply outstanding with many great scenes, much of action and plenty of mystery. About the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Felicity Jones who played as Jyn Erso and not only reached her potential but I also believe that she was simply amazing. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Donnie Yen who played as Chirrut Îmwe, Diego Luna who played as Cassian Andor and Wen Jiang who played as Baze Malbus.Finally, I have to say that ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a great prequel movie which answers some very important questions. It has a very interesting plot, many great interpretations made by its cast and an outstanding direction. If you are a fan of Star Wars then you just have to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to love it and you won't be disappointed at all."
" A Surprise Addition to the Classic Trilogy
",0.2732,-0.8442,2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This is probably my 2nd favorite Star Wars movie. (My favorite will be revealed shortly.) The team that wrote, directed, and scored this film should do all of the future movies. Not since The Phantom Menace have I seen a movie worthy to be called a Star Wars film. (The other 2 prequel movies were cool, but I consider them Palpatine's story. And rightly so, as Palpatine is probably one of cinema's greatest villains.) Rogue One could have been a true fiasco by riding on the strands of story about the capturing of the Death Star plans, and if it was made any later, it would have been probably considered ""yet another Death Star film"". But Rogue One had character, characters, heart, dialogue, grit, and pacing just as much as the original/classic trilogy had, and I feel is a welcome addition to be embraced. It truly made you cheer for the rebel alliance, and weep for their sacrifices against the fearsome Empire.My favorite Star Wars film is The Empire Strikes Back."
" Great 1970s sci fi returns with better special effects

The only let down for me was the poor quality of some of the speech near the beginning. Were the actors whispering or mumbling? I missed some of the early dialogue of the characters playing the rebels.
Overall, I enjoyed this film, and the end was one of hope."

" Best New Star Wars Movie
",0.1531,0.1666,2018-12-03 00:00:00,9,"The idea of the Star Wars series making movies outside of the main story was questionable at first, given the sheer amount they could explore, and how that would tie in to the main story. If they're all as good as Rogue One, then they're good to go. It follows the story of the Rebellion, and how they came to acquire the Death Star plans, which was the central conflict of the original 1977 Star Wars movie. While it may seem unnecessary to explain that, it does it well enough to keep us interested with a new set of characters, some mysteries explained, and some absolutely fantastic action.There's a whole new set of characters. The main character is Jyn Erso, the daughter of the architect of the Death Star. She's not the type to get involved in the war, or to really care about it, at least at the start of the movie. She's joined by a gang of new characters, the best of which is Chirrut. Chirrut is played by Donnie Yen, popular Chinese movie star. He may or may not be Force sensitive, but he's an excellent fighter and a very wise man. The other major character is Captain Andor, the morally ambiguous leader of the group. However, it's impossible to talk about Rogue One without the ending. Everyone dies. Every single member of that crew dies. Not even K2-SO, the comic relief droid, is safe. While that may put a lot of people off, it was necessary. It avoids the giant plothole of not having them in the Originals.It's very different from most of the Star Wars movies for a host of different reasons. The first, and most notable, is that there is very little usage of the Force. The Force is at the center of the main conflicts in the core Star Wars series, Originals, Prequels, and Sequels alike. Despite the lack of the Force, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. This is, however, owed to the fact that several classic characters and vehicles return. The other notable difference is that it's the most violent movie in the series, bar none. There's no question about it. While the main Star Wars series has all sorts of Science Fiction violence, Rogue One felt more like a straight up war movie set in the Star Wars Galaxy. This is likely due to the presence of familiar weapons and ships.There's no denying that Darth Vader is the best thing about the movie. He's the reason a lot of people saw this movie. For anyone who didn't see the Originals in theaters, this was the chance to see Vader on the big screen. He only has two scenes, one with Krennic, and then ""the scene."" The scene is the ultimate fanboy moment; watching Vader rampage through a hall of Rebel soldiers. The other nostalgic callbacks are welcome. Since it's set just before the Originals begin, you have the TIE Fighters, the X-Wings, the Star Destroyers, and of course, the Death Star. The Death Star was so cool. The best shot in the whole movie was the one where it forms an eclipse over Jedha. The Battle of Scarif is, dare I say, the best space battle in the entire series. The battle on the ground was very well done too. Seeing the Rebels and the Empire clash on the big screen again was a great experience, especially for those of who were born after the Originals came out. The cameos are awesome. It's an excellent addition to the Star Wars canon, and I'd say it'll be the best of the spin-offs for quite a long time."

Being a prequel to A New Hope, it explores the events that took place immediately before Leia got her hands on the detailed plans of the Death Star, including its weaknesses. A ""gift"" only possible thanks to the efforts and sacrifice of many. They somehow managed to capture the atmosphere of the original trilogy, which felt pretty good. The cast selection was intelligent, with everyone getting along and portraying interesting and somewhat relatable characters that aren't your usual ""justice fighters"". The tension and emotion in the darkest moments is palpable and the ending was fitting, leaving me sad due to wanting more from these characters, despite knowing from the beginning how things would go, which in itself speaks volumes...

The hero witness the worst (two times) and has a great motivation.
The Supporting actor doesn't steel story from the hero's story (they didn't cast some big name male hero actor to distract from the her story).
The droid is aggressive rather then passive.
The antagonist has a clear motivation (bureaucratic power plays was cool to watch).Cinematography
Great visuals (From the farm planet to the desert out post, rain planet, tropical beach with a space battle squeezed in).Story
It was dark. The hero is trying to save her dad while her partner is sent to kill him.The story shows characters not trusting anyone (even the droid) which is refreshing to watch in a Star Wars movie.The force is just a myth or abstract idea that some guy who didn't have it but believed in it so much he did amazing things based on faith.The story ends with a lot of death for a lot of people but ends with hope."

" The Best Star Wars film of the 2010s
",0.1531,0.9953,2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Yeah, we can ALL agree that TLJ was a major joke and shame to everything Star Wars. The Force Awakens was okay, but did not spark as a legitimate Star Wars that could be at least on par with the original trilogy, but was entertaining. Rogue One is the greatest well crafted Star Wars film outside the original trilogy from way back in the day! No, it is not about the characters who wield light sabers, so do not expect a lot of saber duels in this film. Expect A LOT of gun fights instead! I know, Sabers are to Star Wars as the whip is to Indiana Jones, or even Iron Man is to Tony Stark, but this film managed to make a lack of sabers make sense. About the characters, they are all FANTASTIC!!!! No, there is not a lot of character development, but that is a sliver of an issue that fades away VERY quickly, because all of these characters really have their shine and it is impossible to dislike any of these characters, well with the exception of a couple of villains. These characters are not even wooden or generic, but feel like people who are worth caring about, and they are. There are a few characters who are more fleshed out than others, but all of these characters are fantastic! Considering this is a movie under Disney, humor is spread throughout this movie, but hits EVERY time! The character who carries his own humor is K-2SO, a reprogrammed android who fights alongside the Rogue One group. He is a very unique android unlike the most known, including C3PO and R2D2. He is an android who acts very human like, even though there is nothing that looks human on him, like Terminator. He looks like a robot, but speaks very much like a human would and has human-like expressions. He steals just about every scene he is in! He is the comic relief of this movie. This is the kind of humor that should be in a SW film, if done right. Rogue One is a very dark and dramatic story that is REAL SW material, believe it or not! I wish more newer SW films were like this! The cgi is fantastic, the story is fantastic, the portrayals are fantastic, the emotions are fantastic, and the battles are fantastic! About Darth Vader, yes he has only 4 min of screen time at least, but he is very crucial to the story. His appearance is nothing short of how menacing he is the original movies in any case. Plus, HIS SCENE!!!!! His scene actually makes the ENTIRE film, even if the rest of the movie was fantastic! That scene, even with the music combine and acting of the rest of the rebels who 'survived' his attack, he shown his darkest moment he has ever had in the SW saga and it was INCREDIBLY chilling, even when he had an objective during that scene that was so simple, and that scene was basically a horror movie moment. This movie, believe it or not, even being under Disney, is a special masterpiece that is very dear to the original SW saga! Forget the meaningless Solo film and sequel trilogy... This movie is also an anthology that actually is a prequel to the first SW, A New Hope, just happening shortly before A New Hope begins. One last thing, I wish the Rogue One team didn't all die, because of how much I love the characters, but it only made sense for that to happen, because...this is a prequel....and obviously they are not in the main saga..."

The odds are that blablas running Disney and ruining everything they touch will unlikely see it this way but still; one can hope that this highly watchable piece of entertainment will turn out to be a soothing spirit for some nostalgic old fans and in some cases even create new followers.Overall this movie has glimpses of the highly regrettable trend in todays Hollywood where the real talent hides itself in lesser known products while keeping away from traditional popcorn blockbusters made for those representing the idiocy of today.

" the best on this movie is Darth Vader
",0.6369,-0.9876,2018-10-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie wants to appear plausible but in vain.
Problems are the structure of the movie in general, and the usual succession of events too fast to make the characters reliable, furthermore there are too much apparent stupid choices, such as:
1) the imperial pilot traitor has long hair and beard;
2) the protagonist becomes the lead of resistance since the second meeting of rebellion;
3) the imperial regime could finish the Death Star but needs the help of a rebel scientist who makes the death star faulty. It's obvious;
4) the appearance of the rebel soldiers infiltrated is not plausible (they appear as rebels): ""cutting both beard and the hair so to appear as an imperial soldier"". As I said too fast events to make the movie plausible.
5) the movie is too much linked to the past narrative structure to be original - the viewer recognize this weakness so to be annoyed from it.
Another big flaw regards the possibility to introduce the original deleted scenes during the capture of the rebel cargo by the Imperial star destroyer when Luke observes the light in the sky of the fight as well as the dialogue between Luke and Biggs (you can see it on youtube) which would have enhanced the past events matching well between the Rogue One and A New Hope episodes in a wonder way.
I save only the final battle in the space although the absurd believer-fighter of rebellion who is not shot by imperial soldiers just because he repeats a stupid litany.
These reasons make both the storytelling and the directing mediocre as well, persuading me that by now Star Wars franchise is able only to give nausea to an illusory hope."

",-0.3182,-0.8951,2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,"This is a pointless, poorly written and acted cash-in, that wrecks several points of series continuity for no discernable purpose while adding nothing of value to the canon.Godzilla (2016) director Gareth Edwards has another visually well crafted but otherwise empty action spinoff to add to his short CV; concerned with telling the story of the rebel spy faction that stole the plans of the first Death Star, mentioned in passing in A New Hope (1977), Rogue One is a sloppily contrived fan film peopled by two-dimensional (in some cases literally, with both Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher represented by doll-eyed CGI clones) characters and a tired storyline, the conclusion of which can surprise no-one who has viewed any of the original episodes.Felicity Jones makes little impression in the lead, her permanent expression of sulky insouciance failing to endear, while Diego Luna is possibly the wettest leading man since Patrick Duffy. The supporting cast, including Donnie Yen as an amateur Jedi and Alan Tudyuk as a sarcastic droid fair a little better, but are given distressingly little room to develop.Pace, narrative focus and dialogue are all of highly variable quality, and the shrill, hand-me-down score can never reach the evocative heights of John Williams' venerable theme music. FX (CGI Leia and Moff Tarkin aside) and visual compositions are predictably impressive, but without an emotional centre to the story it becomes hard to care, and with the outcome already known it's ultimately a wearisome affair, made worse by some egregious plotting that bungles the attempt to link with the original trilogy.At least we are spared any embarrassing histrionics from Darth Vader, ala Revenge of the Sith (2005), but it's small consolation in a totally misconceived and gratuitous exercise in cinematic fan-fiction, that adds nothing and only further degrades the canon while trying to enlarge it."
" A gritty but fantastic film
",0.7096,0.9885,2018-09-23 00:00:00,9,"The first of the Star Wars Anthology movies has a lot to offer here.Not only are we back in time to just before the events of A New Hope, but we get to see how events unfolded leading up to the opening scene in the original.The cast were all fantastic. Felicity Jones, Ben Mendolson and Donnie Yen were the standouts for me. The remaining cast were just as good. It was great to see Stormtroopers again and even better to see the return of my favourite character, Darth Vader.The movie is a lot darker in tone compared to some of the other Star Wars films. You kind of expected to know what happens at the end. In that sense it was predicatable. But the journey getting there was one hell of a ride.Director Krennic was the perfect villain and played by a fellow Aussie as well which made me happy. And he was the perfect person to have an argument with Tarkin (resurrected through pretty good CGI). The only character which I didn't like was Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera. His motives were not clearly explained in the movie. Like me, if you watched the Clone Wars or the Rebels cartoon you know why he does the things he does. For those who don't watch these or read the books you don't get a sense of what he is doing in the movie, besides being a terrorist. It should have been better explained to the audience.I think this film is far superior to the likes of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It's just a shame so many scenes in the trailers were not in the movie and that a lot of reshoots has to be done.But in the end it worked our brilliantly. And speaking of endings, the scene at the end with Vader was every fan boys dream come true"

" What Star Wars Films Should be Moving Toward
",-0.5574,-0.1117,2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"A grittier, darker, more adult treatment of Star Wars. For once, a Star Wars prequel takes full advantage of its chronology and the lore of the series, by fully taking advantage of the many opportunities to connect and tie itself into that herritage. The ending alone, warrants high praise. The action is also much more intense and mature. The feel is closer to a war movie (which the story really demands) as opposed to mere action-adventure. The tragic sacrifice of the plot marks the series finally taking full ownership and responsibility for the full scope and consequences of the subject matter used to form this now-classic story. This might be my new favorite film of the series!"
" It's not a problem if you don't look up
",0.3089,-0.9667,2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"There's two kinds of Star Wars fans in this world: Those who think that Rogue One is easily the best Disney Star Wars film so far, and those who are wrong.Okay, I'll try to get off my high horse for the rest of the review.Rogue One, to me, is the perfect example of giving fans what they expect in a Star Wars movie, while simultaneously putting a new take on the franchise. Here we see characters who are jaded and war weary. Characters who believe in the ends justifying the means. Rogue One did for Star Wars what Deep Space 9 did for Star Trek. While some will criticise the film for this I personally think it was necessary to allow for the continued evolution of the series. Nobody wants to see new Star Wars films be nothing but a hollow rehash of previous films in the series (Hello Force Awakens). Nor do we want to see a Star Wars film completely destroy what came before it in a nonsensical and childish way (hello The Last Jedi). Rogue One skillfully skirts between these two traps and shows Disney exactly where the franchise should be headed.Ultimately Rogue One gives us enough familiarity to keep us in the Star Wars universe, while simultaneously giving us a reason to watch new films in the series. In my eyes this film is even better than Return of the Jedi, and I don't say that lightly."

I absolutely loved it and, for me, it was the perfect bridge between Revenge Of The Sith and New Hope, new and old, old and new, Bad Lucas and Good Lucas, fiasco and success.
It didn't end happily and reminded us of the sacrifices the rebels had to make for the rebellion to have a chance.

" A rebellion built on hope
",0.34,0.9248,2018-08-30 00:00:00,8,"In between the events of Episodes III and IV, it seems like all hope is lost for the rebellion when they find out the existence of the weapon known as the Death Star, which is well-known in the movie universe as a weapon that can destroy whole planets. However, when it is learned that there is a weakness in the Death Star plans, the rebellion - led by Jyn Erso (played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones) - go all out to get the plans to the Death Star so that there can once again be hope in the galaxy.All in all, a great movie! The actors are all great in their parts. Felicity Jones plays off the plucky, rebellious hero well; she is dealing with the absence of her father, who was taken by the Imperial forces when she was a young child. Diego Luna is fantastic as her right hand man, while Emmy Nominee Alan Tudyk (who by now is well known for his voice over roles) provides comic relief as K-2SO. We also get some accomplished veterans that join the Star Wars universe; Academy Award Winner Forest Whitaker plays the wise Saw Gerrera, while Mads Mikkelsen portrays Jyn's father.While the only well-known director in the Star Wars universe used to be George Lucas, in recent years, it has gotten more well-known directors in the directors chair, such as J.J. Abrams, Rian Johnson and Ron Howard. This time, it is Emmy Nominee Gareth Edwards, who is well-known for his direction in Monsters and the big monster blockbuster Godzilla. Here he takes the Star Wars direction to new places, and while I did miss the lightsabers, it was a refreshing change of pace for the Star Wars franchise. He focuses more on the war aspects of the story and not just the characters or the flashy moments.All in all, a great Star Wars film! Go and watch it!"

It yells the story of a bunch of rebels fighting to get the plans. The entire movie was a non-stop thrill ride and the ending with the battle on Scarif and Darth Vader. The Scarif battle was very cool and showed each member's job and how they completed it so that the rebels got the plans. But the ending is what sold it to me. Nobody knew who the rebels were and they all died which explains how you don't hear about them in other movies. Them there's the Darth Vader scene where he goes through the ships slaughtering the rebels. It was fantastic!!"

The story of Jyn and her father is genuinely touching. The rebels are wonderfully portrayed as ruthless, morally ambiguous, and very unsure of themselves. Don't forget, this is all before Luke Skywalker emerged to give them an idealistic leader. Best of all, you get a chance to witness the buildup to the events of New Hope, experiencing the Empire as it was coming into its might.Forget the prequels with their CGI spectacles, forget the sequels with their flaccid, simpering emo crybaby villain, Kylo Ren. Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we've desperately craved since Return of the Jedi."

There will be a review for Solo as well once when I have got round to see it.If you want an example of a good Disney Star Wars movie I would highly recommend Rogue One.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.

This shows the answer to the Rebel Spaceships, striking from a hidden base. How did those plans get nabbed? Who did they go to? The final battle over Scarif, as well as showing just how really relentless and evil the Empire is, as well as Vaders appearance at the end made this an instant classic. Just an excellent movie."

It could have been two movies, if written with more care by a creative storyteller. There was absolutely NO character development at all. Everyone played a two-dimensional role and dialog was boring. The story was rushed to give us just enough to see what happened without putting us into the people and places that made it happen. As a result, the acting felt like a bad script reading.There was a lot of visual nostalgia, for sure. The effort put into the CGI was astounding. The idea for the story was great. Challenging, because everyone knows this story. Everyone who's familiar with Star Wars knows exactly how this ends. But this story deserves a character study. It needs to make the audience want to be involved. Instead, we got an epic 2 hour commercial for more Star Wars merch. It was beautiful, it was big, it ended with a shrug."

For the first time it wasn't about heroes who are always right(eous), but it took a more mature approach of each individual having his or her personal reasons to join the fight. Which I really liked, because it makes them way more relatable. The characters might be a little underdeveloped, but there is a pretty good reason for that (as most of us know), so that doesn't bother me at all. The story itself was also interesting and kept me hooked during the movie. Top that off with stunning visuals and audio (duh) and you've got a movie that you can enjoy for years to come."

I remember going to the drive in and seeing the original Star Wars and empire Strikes Back when it first debut. I was Amazed to say the least along with millions of other fans. I didn't have questions like where did Vader come from or what year is this set in. I always wanted to know from the first ten minutes of the original Star Wars-A new hope is how did they get plans to the Death Star. Ive imagined my own story of how they got the plans, Ive talked to others over the many years when star wars came up in conversation but then this movie came out and answered my question better than I have ever imagined. I have no idea why this movie got bashed. Was it because of the prequels, was it because it didn't involve hans solo, or luke skywalker. People this tells the story of 1 specific part of the whole star wars story. Watch it again, I promise you will love it for that. If you are a true fan of everything star wars then there is no possible way you can hate this movie. The only thing bad to me is now I have another question that bothers me. What happened to the Death troopers. They came, they looked awesome and they vanished after this movie."

Didn't Leia steal those plans? Let's dig Carrie Fischer up and check in with her... but I'm sure she's happy; not only have we effectively killed Han Solo the character, but we killed Han Solo's legacy.
Interesting parallel with the whole consolidation of power to a single woman in this universe and how we glorify that just because she's female, while scorning men whose power is equal or greater--out of fearing the things she can't understand.

It had it all, a proper convincing well put together storyline. A film that never paused to breath and everyone died as they had to ..... and I was in tears and just watched R1 for the 7th time and still in tears ....So after this and despite seeing some dodgy reviews of TLJ I saw it and no more Star Wars for me - Episodes 1-7 plus Rogue One is ALL I need now. Farewell Star Wars, from when I was 5 to 46 you have kept me gripped, gave me hope and this is how I want to remember you and not the farce you have become under JJ Abrams and Johnson ....Adieu"
" Not much connect with the series yet interesting
",0.4019,0.5423,2018-06-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie shows the lead in the Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso who assumed the responsibility of cracking down the plan of the Death Star (a potential weapon capable of destroying an entire planet). A team of rebellion forces has been formed against the dark forces yet the optimism which is triggered by Jyn.
This movie largely underlines the sacrifices made by the rebellion forces for a larger cause.
Chirrut is shown as an interesting character. Also interesting was the significant role was also played by K2-SO. An emotional story with breathtaking fighting scenes took is enough to take you into it. 
Finally the plan is handed over to Leia, the head of the organization fighting against dark forces. On the horrific side was the entry of Lord Vader who has turned invincible and unstoppable. It would be interesting to see how Jedi manage to restore the balance."
" One of the best Star Wars movies ever!
",0.2244,0.9411,2018-06-14 00:00:00,9,"When I first saw this in the theater I thought the best part was the war in Scarif. You really think that something might go wrong for the Rebel Alliance but they desperately work it out! Another good thing is that the heroes die in the end, which doesn't make a happy ending (which is good in my opinion). And the last best part of this was the romance between Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, they die holding hands! 9/10. Great entertainment!"
" Could Have Been Good, But Ended Up Boring and Forgettable
",-0.25,-0.8499,2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"When I heard that this film was basically another prequel and not just an bland retread like The Force Awakens, I was actually somewhat looking forward to it and thought it would be a good home viewing - boy was I wrong. Long story short - a lot happens in Rogue One, but almost none of it really means anything because it has almost no substance. The idea on paper was still good and the Vader scenes were well done, but other than those two scenes, the entire film is horribly bland and completely forgettable. The characters are about as cardboard as they come and have almost zero character development. There are only three characters in the entire film who I found myself giving an iota for as I watched it, and those were the droid (can't remember its name), Jyn, and Galen - and even all three of them weren't given enough development; they were just better than the other characters. The score is also unbelievably ""bleh"" and does not help the film at all. I have heard other reviews argue that this film is ""deep"" - yeah, maybe for a 13-year-old. But for someone simply looking for a good film, there is no substance and it feels like a two-hour waste of time. It is so boring that it is almost the perfect opposite of entertainment.So, at the end of the day, this is yet another fine example of how to sell a film with its name. If this film didn't have the Star Wars name on it, its Rotten Tomatoes score would be incredibly low and I doubt it's IMDb consensus would be a 7.9/10. Normally I would rate this about a 3/10, but considering how high the current IMDb consensus is, all it's getting is a 1/10."
" A Ranting Review.
",0.0,-0.9132,2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"Do not read this if you liked this movie. I cannot fathom why people liked this over the last Jedi. Yes, Last Jedi had a lot of issues, but it had a lot of good stuff in it too. But I thought this whole movie was a problem in itself. I am at least thankful, like I was for Last Jedi, that whoever was fighting for a good story picked the right battles to win. I'm happier that the actual new Star Wars movies are decent and that this one is bad instead of the other way around. This was one of the most overall generic movies I've ever seen. There's nothing compelling about it. We have a flat heroine, flat supporting characters, a flat villain, if you can even call Krennic a villain, generic dialogue and there's not even any suspense because everyone know how it ends. What was really annoying about it was that I could tell that the writers (or whoever was giving them orders) were trying to make the movie cool and fun and interesting at a lot of points. But when you don't give your characters respect, there's only so much you can do. Jyn Erso doesn't make any active decisions, which is basically the litmus test for a weak protagonist. And none of the other characters don't really help her out at all. Seriously, I only finished watching this to say that I had seen it and to see the Darth Vader scene at the end that I'd had hyped up for me (to which I say ""Mediocre""). Also, the whole premise of the movie is not that good. There is a reason that A New Hope did not detail how they got the Death Star Plans: it's not that important or interesting. It's just a thing that happened. Any conflict that came up in the movie felt completely contrived and fake. The characters basically get mad at each other to make it seem like tensions are high, but it's fake. None of them really have distinctive points of view, so the conflicts are only as interesting as the subject of each argument, which is pretty weak to begin with. Anyone in the Rebellion that doesn't think they should destroy the Death Star or try to steal the plan and stuff is just wrong, and we as the audience know that, so there's nothing interesting about seeing them argue about it. This made the one debate scene near the end possibly my least favorite scene in any Star Wars movie. It could have been good if it had been a character moment for Jyn. Had I written this movie, I would have made Jyn be more reluctant to join the rebellion and go along, just doing things because she had to. Then when the rebellion realized that they needed to go get the plans, they would ask for volunteers and that could be the moment when Jyn decides she's in. The supporting characters could have reflected the different sides of her internal argument, with one fully believing in it, another feeding her apathy and influencing her throughout. I think that would have been a much better movie. Cassian's line at the end ""Your father would be proud of you"" really put the last nail in Rogue One's coffin for me. First of all, that line should be banned from movies along with ""we got company"" because it's been used so many times and is basically just tacked on nowadays. More importantly, Jyn was never looking for approval from her father. Yes, she completed his mission, but that's not the same thing and a line about her doing that would have been much more thematic.I don't particularly think that this movie should have been made, but it could have been much better than it was. Like it if you want, but I don't see a whole lot to like. I haven't heard great things about Solo, but I think it will probably be better than Rogue One because it contains characters that the writers know they have to do a good job with. But if this is the way that the spinoff movies are going, count me out. Overall Rating: 4.5/10."

I'm a Star Wars fan from waaay back, and as I'm watching this for the 15thish time I felt compelled to sing its praises. I just saw SOLO for the second time and was very happy with that, as well, but ROGUE ONE is just a bold, beautiful addition to the Star Wars canon. Tarkin, Vader, and loveable new heroes. KRENNIC is an awesome bad guy. Freaking great. And what they did to revive Peter Cushing was just amazing. As I mentioned, I'm a SW fan from waaaay back, and RW is 3rd on my all time fav list. That's a pretty big deal. 1. Empire

" What the VII episode didnt become
",0.0,0.9083,2018-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Long ago, when I had a poor understanding of the cinematographic universe, when the plot of films was deeply indifferent to me, I saw a wonderful film in which the hero escaped in the belly of a dead unknown beast, and giant metal elephant-turtles walked along the snow-covered planet. And, I did not think that these feelings can be repeated in adulthood.Unexpected discovery: Rogue One, one woke a child in me, although the plot was clear, and there was no infantile desire to jump into tact with gunfights and fights. It was just great. It was just a classic trilogy, elevated to the absolute. It's just the same as many years ago. And, what is very important, without any hidden pathos, without an obsessive director's ""wink"" in the style of ""well, you realized that this character returned and everyone giggles and applauds.""So, Rogue One, of course, is a fresh look. This is another camera work. These are other perspectives and, as was rightly noted in trailer analyzes, this is an amazing work with scales. The director and the cameraman made things that you believe in. You believe in the size of the Death Star. Believe in the size of the Star Destroyer. And, okay, it would be one thing: launched a comparative infographics, and finished on that one. No, here all objects of space are constantly involved in some kind of action. The Death Star moves, the Destroyers engage in battle, the transport workers, fighter jets and bombers are fighting alongside. This is a ""wow"", this is ""super"", this is the star thriller we wanted. The fighter in which the fighters actually shoot down the enemy, and the bombers cause point torpedo strikes, where the technique creates a real cover, and not just ""hanging around for the crowd"", as in the Awakening of the Force. And, yes, this is the very setting of the fights that was in the original trilogy. I am delighted. This is a new operator's view of the old scale of star battles.The next moment is the preservation of the style of Lucas. Here everything pleases not less. This is a city similar both to Naboo I episode and Tatooine IV episode. This is nature, similar to what we saw in the second part (during the rapprochement of Anakin with Amidala), or on Kashyyyk with its battles in the woods. Everything looks natural and beautiful. There are no eared adherents of the dark side, wading through unnatural winter forests, built on an old 3D engine. The whole environment looks beautiful, relevant, familiar in the atmosphere. It seems that this is called landscape design.The plot of the film is not snotty, does not shine with pathos. Everything happens naturally. Heroes look vital, at first glance, there is no logic. The actors also played very well. Emotions want to believe, the motivation is clear.VII episode of the Star Wars exported at the expense of the name. If you remove the name, you will receive a parody of the IV part with comical physics and a trash story. But Rogue One is a terrific epic saga. One of the best films in the universe of Star Wars."

I respect Gareth Edwards for some of the choices made in the end of the movie which mainly landed. One of the bigger issues with this movie is the pacing of the movie as I have said that the first half of this movie is very slow but eventually gets going and thats why really I really it up to and 8/10 for me.

Giaccino is one of my favourite composers and he did a fine job this time.The problem I have with Rogue One are all the continuity errors, plot holes and bad CGI.Bad CGI is a huge problem. It really breaks the quality of the movie. The Tarkin (played by now deceased Peter Cushing in Episode 4) looks like a character in a 2008 video game and not to even mention Leia (played by our beloved Carrie Fisher in previous movies), who was much worse CGI than Tarkin.Continuity errors and plot holes such as things like locations, the presence of Death Troopers in both this movie and TLJ and unexplainable behaviour of Tarkin.Watching this movie was bitter for me since I really loved legends and the original expanded universe and I seriously hated how it replaced my beloved characters as Kyle Katarn.In my opinion, this movie is average. It is not the worst star wars movie, but very far from the best."

Just because it's perhaps the best Star Wars film since 'Return Of The Jedi (1986)', where the talking teddy bears had more depth than any character here, doesn't mean it's particularly good.

But, I suppose all the years of experience have taught them plenty about character development."
" Disney Does it Again
",0.0,0.9942,2018-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Many were skeptical of Disney's take on the Star Wars saga, but after the stellar Force Awakens could they do it again, the short answer YES-Rogue One is interesting as it is the first in the Star Wars anthology series, these films won't take place in the Skywalker Saga, but instead tell other stories that have happened in the universe filling in the glass. Hence Rogue One the tale of a band of rebels who discovered the Death Star plans, many people have sighted this as one of the best Star Wars films, and I think it's great, but it's not perfect. So let's start with the good, the characters are fantastic from our leads Jyn and Cassian to the scene stealing favorites K2-SO and Chirrutt, to the fantastic performance from Ben Mendelsohn portraying Krenic. The effects are fantastic and Michael Giaccinno's Score is very well done, I'm also a huge fan of the darker tone in this film, it doesn't go super dark, but it's nice to see another film with a tone that compares to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" So let's talk about some of my least favorite parts, the film is written quite well but it drags a little in the middle which would be fine if the direction left something to be interested there, and while I definitely don't hate Gareth Edwards direction (I mean I love his take) he just had a specific tone (evident from Godzilla-2014) like I said the darker tone is fine but sometimes that can stray into a dull feeling. There is also some unessesary fan service moments, upon first viewing it's really neat, but after you've seen it a few times it can feel awkward, some of them work and are really cool to see (C3-P0, Darth Vader hallway fight) and some of them just feel weird (The bar fight guys from Episode IV) All in all I love the film and think it's another solid Star Wars entry that I'm proud to call one of my favorites."
" Really quite dark.
",0.0,0.891,2018-04-24 00:00:00,9,"To be honest I was never a 'true' fan of the Star Wars genre. Don't get me wrong , I watched them all (even ... the second three ... NAFF or what ?)
But the reason I say this is that they were never truly 'hard' science fiction, more like Flash Gordon ... might I even go to far as to say kid's science fiction ! But they were always well made, and I watched them all.This film however crossed another line. It is actually a really a dark film, not so much kid's stuff at all. In this film there is a streak of 'Alien' and even of 'Blade Runner.' It doesn't present warfare as a struggle where the guys in white hats do away the guys in black hats. It shows that there must be sacrifice in any struggle ... good or bad. It is a dark movie ... but it's beautifully honest, and for me, the best Star Wars movie I've seen so far."
" A Decent Holdover For Those Who Waited For TLJ
",0.0,0.9923,2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,"I saw The Force Awakens opening night. The moment the film started with the iconic Star Wars title crawl, the theater erupted in cheer and applause. Wide smiles were all around and everyone was finally about to see what happened to our favorite characters after a lackluster prequel series, and the original trilogy's last film having came out over 30 years prior. I was among the excited film-goers. As the as of yet untitled eighth film does not arrive until next year, Rogue One would have to tide us over in the meantime. So how does it fare?It starts with a complete absence of a title crawl.Now this might seem somewhat of a silly complaint, but hear me out. Not only is this the first Star Wars film to ditch the title crawl, but seeing it in The Force Awakens made me realize that we had something to look forward to. We would get a three decade long closure. Rogue One features a cast of characters the likes of which we have yet to see. As the film takes place after Revenge of the Sith but before A New Hope, nobody featured in Rogue One really matters aside from the fact to serve as a reminder that we are watching a spin-off. Does that really lead to something overly thrilling if it does not really add to the main film series? Something about the lack of a title crawl served as a harsh reminder that unlike The Force Awakens, I didn't feel I was looking forward to much. But onto the rest of the film.After the aforementioned odd absence of a title crawl, I found myself, unfortunately, incredibly bored during the first half of the film. I found myself not connecting with the characters, not caring about the mission the characters were undergoing (which takes a long time to really get going), and overall just sort of ""meh"". Many of the characters are not very developed and generally the script seemed ""okay"" at best. Aside from a few notable parts of the Star Wars score appearing throughout, John Williams was also replaced as the films composer as well, with the new composer unfortunately not bringing in the same ""oomph"" as Williams. Overall It wasn't particularly bad in the sense of ""this film is total rubbish"", but rather that the film was just sort of there, not really serving a purpose.However, there comes a lovely silver lining to all that I had wrong with Rogue One in the end. And that is that luckily, the second half is much better than the slow first half, with the last quarter of the film being worth the cost of admission on it's own. The finale was a highly enjoyable powerhouse and I found that all my previous complaints began to drift away. Slowly, I came to appreciate Rogue One more and more. Among some of the films higher points include: The beautiful scenery and sets. The Force Awakens pulled this off as well, and for a spin-off, I was glad to see Rogue One was able to look as good as it did. Some characters of the previous films also return for varying levels of importance as well, which was a welcome surprise, as well as tons of cameos of other known characters throughout the series got a few smiles in as well.Overall, what started as a dull and worrisome entry of the franchise (in my non-professional opinion), turned out to be decent hold-over for the upcoming episode eight. Just make it through the first half, and you will probably come to find that in the end, Rogue One is a fairly welcome entry to the franchise.(THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BACK WHEN THE MOVIE WAS FIRST IN THEATERS)"
" KYLE KATARN MUCH??? JAN ORS MUCH??? LEGO DESIGNS MUCH?? *one heavy spoiler*
",0.0,0.916,2018-04-14 00:00:00,2,"So if you're going to make a movie about popular video game characters and change their names, you should realize that people will notice. But as with everything in life, most people won't notice because they don't understand what they're watching. Lot's of things in this movie were cool conceptually and lots were not. The story was just like a video game in that the characters ran from objective to objective pulling switches. A shameful rendering of Peter Cushing fooled many, but not me. Pitiful word play for the names and planets. A bloated Darth Vader helmet with red eyes was surprising as well. In episode IV his eyes had a ""red tint"" but were not red. NOW, thats not to say that Darth didn't have a replacement helmet at some point with fully red eyes but why so bloated in the neck. Also why did he carry himself like a teenage girl when he walked across the bridge of the Star Destroyer?? Go back and watch Darth take girly steps. Even in the slaughter scene he was a bit effeminate. Just sayin, no offense to the effeminate among us. Watch the originals and Darth's helmet changes gradually in each film until the perfect rendition we are treated to in 'Return of the Jedi'. Forrest Whittaker is so bad it's flabbergasting, but then again when was he ever good? ""Im one with the force the force is with me"" was the signal that Disney no longer cared about Star Wars and clearly had no idea what these films are about. There's no arguing about that... They see Darth Vader as a one liner character like the terminator. I love James Earl Jones, but he sounds like he's 175 years old now and it was super sad. BUT, it was cool that they understood that all these Mofos were gonna die by the end , and they did, which was legit AF. I could keep going but I wont because it was a MASTER PIECE compared to.........'The Last Jedi' (barf barf barf barf barf barf barf and barf) ALSO the battle droid they stole from KOTOR was BY FAR the best character in the movie."

The acting is absolutely first class in what is a complimentary SW instalment explaining and tying everything together to perfection as a lead-in to A New Hope and the original trilogy that everyone knows and loves.I can only hope for more Anthology films like this as the Last Jedi and new trilogy has left me disappointed.Rian Johnson could learn a lot on how to direct here."
" A very interesting plug
",0.4576,0.4495,2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"In my opinion, this film is a very interesting link between trilogies. Yes, the timing was unfortunate and very ""cash-grab"" but as for the review of nothing more than the movie itself. to a true fan of the franchise, it did not lack substance. It may not have had the backing or be canon of the original story line. But to an imaginative person, it is quite fun to imagine. My only negative opinion would be that because it is indeed a bridge movie (Between 3-4) it is impossible to have any sequels (Since pretty much everyone, with exception to Darth Vader and Tarkin (for obvious reasons) is confirmed or presumed dead. Which leaves an impressed viewer feel wanting after seeing this. But reviewing this as just a connecting stand alone film to bridge between episode 3 to 4 and not in the horrid fashion of clone wars, I would say for what it was supposed to be and for what it is... it is not too bad. 
TL;DR : If you want a sequel, don't expect to like it. If you are a Star Wars Nerd, you will probably like it. Take it for what it is. A bridge movie between trilogies."

" The Least Appealing of the Star Wars Movies
",-0.5574,-0.5347,2018-03-20 00:00:00,5,"In the Star Wars anthology series, taking place just before the very first film in 1977 (which was fourth in the actual series): Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is on a mission to disable a planet-destroying device (the Death Star) that is owned by the Galactic Empire - a device that her father was forced to create.As could be expected, the set design and special effects are breathtaking. But in fairness, without such technical superiority, the film would be bland. The story and characters are not captivating enough and occasionally, there is too much happening for the average viewer (as opposed to a sci-fi-geek) to follow without getting confused and even bored at times.There are many scenes in which front-line soldiers for the ""bad guys"" are killed off in droves with an attitude that is meant to be comical. This is an old gag that cheapens life for those that are considered to be 'nobodys'. The filmmakers could do better than this in their action scenes instead of regurgitating old crowd-pleasing techniques that have worked in the past but are now outdated.While there were fine scenes and excitement in the beginning, these virtues were not maintained throughout the remainder of the film. There is also a very questionable use of CGI to recreate actors as they looked a long time ago (but not in a galaxy far far away). While the technology is brilliant, such usage is more than questionable.I made the mistake of thinking that this film was the follow-up to last year's entertaining ""The Force Awakens"". It didn't follow that film in either sequence or in quality."

The only reason I went to see this movie was because I was dragged along by pretty much my entire family. Due to all the hype around this movie and the good reviews, I was actually planning on enjoying this movie. I didn't. Sights and Sounds - This movie is relatively well shot. Most of the effects are ok. The sound design is pretty bad, and its pretty hard to understand what the characters are saying most of the time. Plot - The plot is simplistic and full of holes. The first half of this movie is somewhat decent, but after that it quickly falls apart. A lot of the character motivations are flimsy. Overall, aside from a few scenes, the script is terrible. Action - The only thing that kept me from screaming at how stupid and illogical all the fighting tactics were was the fact that I was in a movie theater. The action in this move is so bad. I'd heard that they're bad in the previous movies - but that's no excuse. Characters - Most of these characters are extremely unlikable. The only one I liked was a robot (K-2SO). The characters are dumbed down and infuriating. The acting may be good, but the script isn't. If you don't like watching stupid people run across a screen, I'd recommend skipping this movie.The more I remember about this movie to write this review, the more I remember how bad this movie is, and the angrier I get. I guess fans of the series like this movie, but I just couldn't. The characters are stupid, the action is terrible, the plot is boring, the effects are sub-par.

",-0.2263,-0.9743,2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One is the emotional equal of The Empire Strikes Back.Anyone who knows anything about screenwriting knows, or ought to know, that the bottom line when attempting to judge whether a movie is good or bad, is ""Were you moved by it emotionally?"" Depending on the genre of movie, the viewer will be moved to different emotions. But the viewer will be moved to the emotions intended by the writer and director. The emotion will not be bafflement resulting from confusion.Rogue One puts the war in Star Wars. It is more of a war movie than a ""space opera"". The tone is unusually dark for a Star Wars movie. Think ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Hacksaw Ridge"" for example. It includes one of the most spectacular climactic battle sequences in recent memory. Rogue One is the equal of the best Star Wars movie to date, The Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps even better. Rogue One spared none of the protagonists. It sacrificed every one of them to the rebellion. It is hard to put into words the pathos that evokes, which paradoxically makes Jyn Erso and her fellow rebels even more heroic and more unforgettable than major characters such as Leia Organa. That some viewers have harshly panned the film utterly baffles me."

Upon first seeing the trailers, the main character reminded me of the ""badass"" characters I tried to write in middle school. The time it's set in (literally right before Episode Four) appealed to me, but that was about it. And working at Galaxy, the trailers got old. So, when it came out, I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't angry, I was just passive towards it. Once it came out, some of my coworkers said it was actually great so I had slightly higher hopes. And then I saw it. There were many more negatives than positives, and it kind of sucks. It's a Star Wars movie, I wanted it to be good. 
Throughout the movie but especially in the beginning, the pacing and tone was really scattered and unclear. It introduced all these characters, and never let you get to know them. I barely knew anything about any of the characters except their occupation and a bland view of their personality type. This also made me not care about the characters or events until the end of the movie. Like with Jyn, yeah okay she's a rebel but why? Is it because of her father? Was she angry that her father was working with the empire? Was she just pissed she was on her own? It didn't even show us her committing some crime like stealing food and giving some to a starving kid, then getting arrested. Since they (I think) were going for a ""rogue with a heart of silver"" archetype, this would've given us some insight into her character. Or maybe, once she's been arrested, have her trying to charm or fight her way out of it to show us what kind of person she is. But no, we just get her roots, then her in a cell, then going to a work camp. Why was she going to the camp anyway? We don't even know what she did to get arrested until she's at the rebel base.
Forest Whitaker's character was completely unnecessary. It felt really shoehorned and flat. And once Jyn is with the rebels, they suddenly trust each other? And care about each other? Why, why I ask you?? There was no characterization like at all, so I didn't believe the character's relationships. A lot of it didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie; adventurous, fun, emotional. I'm not saying it had to have the exact same formula, but it could've fit in a bit more with the rest of the Star Wars movies. It was different, which is good in theory, but it was different in an off-center way. Like it almost hit a homerun, but just missed in an unclear way. The whole thing didn't feel like a beginning, which it is because it essentially sparks the rest of the movies going right into New Hope. But it didn't feel like a beginning, it didn't even feel like it was passing the torch, it felt like an end. Which is this case, it felt like a stand-alone movie that was made after the originals, which it was, but it should've been an unspoken thing where it should've been made in a way that if someone were to watch the Star Wars movies chronologically, it would flow well.
However, the positives. I like that the end glided right into the beginning of New Hope. It felt nostalgic and gave a nice handshake to the originals. Despite the horrible CGI Carrie Fischer. But I digress. It sounds surprising, but I actually liked that everyone died in the end because it was refreshing and realistic, since it's a rebellion and not everyone would always survive. I also like that none of the main characters were a Skywalker or a Jedi. Same with the fact that they have a rebel character that's not totally good and pure, and they have an Empire character that wasn't totally evil. I also loved the lightsaber scene with Darth Vader. The robot K-2SO was also amazing, and surprisingly the character with the most heart."

The main characters are more realistic than the ones we usually see, not mighty jedis nor terrifying siths, but normal people living in a galaxy far, far away; not perfect heros, but people that make mistakes but at the end try to do the things right. We also have the dark side of the Rebellion, we see people trying to do it right but making some choices that aren't the best for all. It humanizes the idealistic Rebellion. One thing that I really liked about the movie is the continuity it has with the whole Star Wars saga, it perfectly fits before Episode IV: A New Hope. Even more, there are a lot of eastern eggs from the original trilogy and some series that Disney have been releasing. The special effects are awesome and the music just perfect for the movie. We also got to see some commedy that doesn't seem forced, but natural and relaxing. In the other hand, we have all kind of fights (except the ones with lightsabers) that are really well-film-scences. This movie is a piece of art that every star wars fan will love and non-fan will appreciate. YOU MUST WATCH IT!"
" Was it really necessary
",0.0,-0.936,2018-02-01 00:00:00,1,"I struggle to find a purpose for this spin off. It was boring from start till end, no message, no metaphore and no notable contribution to the franchise. It has nothing to do with George Lucas and it is a lame attempt to walk into the footsteps of a legendary epic story. Major disappointment."
" A good surprise - no spoilers
",0.4215,0.9916,2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"To put this into context: before I saw this movie, I was against the idea of this movie (milking the franchise), I didn't like the main actress because I didn't really see her in the role of a badass violent rebel spy and we didn't see to know any of the characters in the trailers (except Mon Mothma).Well, that movie shut me up for 2 hours. It's a bit messy in the beginning, many new characters, planets, and you change scene every 3min. 
But the second half of the movie is glorious. Soundtracks are epic, especially the music for the last 10 minutes. No spoiler but you know which soundtrack I mean, and if not, it's called ""your father would be proud"". Visually it's wow, nothing to envy to what would call ""a real star wars"". The last battle (no spoiler I swear) has really really cool and good shots.Casting is good, Felicity Jones was a good surprise and so was Diego Luna. The droid and whoever is ""inside"" is pretty good too. He drops like 1 or 2 jokes but overall, there's no humor. Which leads me to my last point: it's not funny. People are dying, the rebels are seen as terrorists, there is no Anakin line ""This is where the fun begins"", it's not funny Anakin, we're at war god damn it! People aren't smiling, they're sad, dirty, there's few hope. it's pretty dark and I love it. Just a small points about the last scene (go watch it) which I can't spoil... wow. We all wanted to see this since we were kids. It's a bit of fan service but who cares, it was glorious. Ignore the last jedi and go watch this."

But there are plenty of storm troopers in this movie?Regardless, the movie was boring and the story was meaningless. This doesn't even feel like Star Wars, even the original music is absent. There's little reference to the force and there's no real meaning to the story.Disappointing."

" Enjoyable
",0.4404,-0.8818,2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Ever since George Lucas created the first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, millions of people have fallen in love with the classic good vs. evil dynamic that has been very straightforward from the beginning. Rogue One has finally broken the cut-and-dry mold that has been, in my opinion, the downfall of every Star Wars movie. While this is arguably the best Star Wars movie to date it is also painfully similar, almost to the point of redundancy, to every film prior to it. From the harsh background of the main characters, the seemingly all-powerful villain, to the fact that R2-D2 and C-3PO make a guest appearance; watching this movie felt like I was rehashing all of the Star Wars movies that I grew up loving. There were many redeeming qualities however, the graphics and special effects used to make the alien planets won me over. Comparing the Empire to the current administration in the United States and the Rebellion to all those opposed to the current administration, I feel like the choice of planets was impeccable. Many of the places the rebels were camping out were barren planets with very harsh conditions to live, with Jedha being incredibly overpopulated and crowded. On the contrary the planet commanded by the Empire, Scarif, is beautiful, tropical, and pristine. With this being a Star Wars movie I was slightly disappointed with the lack of lightsaber scenes; however, the one that was added topped the cake in terms of Vader's fight scenes. Again, I contribute this to the advancements in special effects and CGI. The themes of sacrifice, faith in the greater good, and disobedience made this film more than the typical Star Wars movie every one was expecting, and was key in making it so successful. I feel like having a more realistic ending, ie: killing all of the main characters, transformed this movie from the feel-good campy Star Wars movie everyone knows and expects into a brand new war film with a lot to offer."

ny overall fellings about rogue one was i enjoyed it and i was great that they would finally fill a mystrey which has been presant since A New Hope so that made me happy there were some awesome moments like seeing vader in the hallway and seeing the CGI Carrie Fisher and while most people don't like it I do and I think that it was awesome to see Tarkin and a young Leia and looking back now with the passing of Carrie Fisher I think that it's Important to honor them even death. By far my favorite character was K-2SO everything he says is so funny and I just love him. Overall I would have to say that rogue one is good but it's not Amazing it has it's flaws but what movie doesn't and it's solid star wars movie."

There isn't any forced political correctness and all the characters in some way have their merits. And in the end it is a story story about sacrifice for a greater cause. And it pulls it off rather well. Imagine an action movie in the Star Wars universe and this movie hits the mark, I just don't understand how Disney is so hit-or-miss with the quality of its films."
" A dark but brilliant side tale to the star wars story (spoliers)
",0.0772,0.9797,2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,"I am puzzled by the negative comments to Rogue One as a lot of people rate ESB as the pinnacle of star wars movies and i'm guessing the whole reason for this is it's all about the plot, the end being of course a real WTF moment. Whilst i still think ESB still holds the ace card for being the best in the whole series, i think Rogue One is a close second.Again, the reason for this is plot. I loved Rogue one for being gritty and there is a real sense of desperation in this movie (people being murdered for knowing too much and orders to kill, also loved the flashback to jin as a child and her father associating with director krennic). The rebels are on the back foot with the empire creating the ultimate machine to inflict terror on anyone who gets in their way. And this is another great point, we see the true terrifying power of the deathstar and its ability to obliterate anything in its path.I have also read comments about there not being enough of the jedi, and I would ask people to look at the end of the first 3 movies (ok, they're not great) but the jedi were almost wiped out and so are hasbeens of a cult long forgotten with only a smattering of believers still left. Again, adding to the desperation of the rebellion.There are moments which are a little annoying, it's a little erratic at times jumping around a little too much. but it is trying to tell a true story of self sacrifice.As for the finale, the beach scene, i personally think it will be remembered as one of the best scenes in a star wars movie. It is truly beautiful and i don't think even Crait in the last jedi comes close to the magnificence of scarif.Coupled with some light humour from K-2SO, a reprogrammed imperial droid who is a lovable and brilliant.I also read that people are commenting on the lack of character build up, but in truth this is a one off story there isn't time for complex character build up. You have to appreciate the sacrifice that the characters made in order to get the plans away and i think it does this amazingly well.As for the darth vader scene at the end, i don't think i have ever seen a darth vader more menacing, brutal and brilliant. If there was ever a scene that conveyed this mans anger, power and general hatred, this is it and its given to us in spades.Its not without its failings, but I will forgive some of the minor flaws in the storybut all in all i loved it. In terms of the force awakens, i just found it a rehash of the original movies. i'm sorry, I wanted to like them, but I didn't find anything original in them at all.In my humble opinion and im sure that I will be flamed, but Rogue one was brilliant."
" Loved It
",0.5994,-0.8906,2018-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Recently I just viewed the film ,""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"", for class and I loved it. The main reason as to why I loved this film was majorly due to the way the story started out with the suspense and underlying tones. It all starts out with Jyn running away from the stormtroopers in order to save herself. However when she does start running, she turns around and tries to come back for her family but when she does, she witnesses her mom dying. This was most likely put in the film to show that Jyn remembers when her mom died, which is unique because it sets up the suspense. 
 Also when we first meet Cassian Andor, he kills the man he is talking to without any note of pain. This is almost like he doesn't care about this man, or he is used to killing people. The reason I feel for this is simply the facial expression he makes. He doesn't show the audience any kind of hurt when he kills the man in point blank range, in order to flee from being captured. 
 Another major thing I love about this movie is the CGI technology they use to bring back characters that have already passed away. Grand Moffe Tarkin is one character they brought back since he passed away but they used CGI to represent a younger Princess Leia. I honestly feel they did this to make the feeling of the film, that much more real. By doing this, it can make the audience more comfortable and relatable to this film. 
 However, there is one thing about this film I do not like at all. The ending is not my favorite. I'm not a big fan on how everyone at the end of the film dies while saving the plans. This frustrates me because the hero aspect of the film is destroyed. Normally in films the hero survives and there is more content on them but with this one, all of the heroes die, making it so there can't be anymore films based around them."
" An average story, despite its Star Wars background
",0.4449,0.9412,2018-01-28 00:00:00,6,"After being separated from her parents since she was little, Jyn Erso ends up collaborating with the Alliance in a desperate attempt to gain the original plans for the Death Star. Together with a group of rogue rebels, she will venture on an Imperial occupied planet, against all odds, in order to bring hope to the universe regarding the infamous Death Star.It's a movie which tells, as its title suggests, a story related to the Star Wars universe, told from a different perspective, which ultimately affects the events from the franchise. Although it brings a sad and apparently thrilling premise, the story fails to impress in any way. It is good, it has consistency, but a bit too predictable and a bit too simple to provide much satisfaction. The characters are on par with the story, not bringing something which might raise the bar. They are quite underdeveloped, some even useless, almost without a clear direction, doing what they do just because they were supposed to do it, not because they actually felt that they should. Or at least that's how it is seen from my point of view. You simply don't get to care about their fate, maybe with one or two exceptions, thus making the finale as dull as it was predictable. To be honest, Cassian's robot was the only one which made itself pleasant and even funny, thus becoming the most cared for character of the movie. And this is, if you ask me, a bad ball for it. The effects are very good, making it a visual pleasure, but this is nothing unexpected when talking about this type of movies. The sad part is that the visuals are the only very good part of this movie which ultimately fails to create something great. Although it had quite a good idea, the actors weren't able to bring something extraordinary to their ""ordinary"" characters, which, to be honest, were the disappointment of the movie. It felt lame, something made just to be there, not managing to transmit emotion to the viewer, which simply awaits the finale, instead of enjoying the story. Yes, I am disappointed by this one, not because I had big expectations regarding it, but because it failed to be a good movie, not to say that it had the whole Star Wars universe at its disposal."
" Not Impressed
",-0.3724,-0.9824,2018-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Going into the movie I wasn't expecting much, I didn't think I would like it much or care for it as it was the first Star Wars movie I've seen. Overall I felt the movie lacked detail, in the character development that was imperative for the audience to build the connections and be invested in the characters well beings. Jyn has a little amount of backstory shown in the opening of the movie that bring some detail into who she is as a person as we see her mother getting killed and her father being captured. Later we see her crying at the hologram her father sent, and even later you get to see her being with him as he dies. These should have been emotional and moving scenes but the actress didn't portray the part and emotions well enough which resulted in me not caring much for her character. She was a very flat character, we didn't get insight into her thoughts or how she was feeling. Without these insights the film lacks the scenes that are crucial in getting the audience to invest in the characters. The movie displays an abundance of Implicit content as shown with the relationship between Cassian and Jyn. They seem to have some sort of connection as they share long looks and close embraces. Cassian disobeys orders for her and helps her start a rebellion of their own. It's seemingly obvious they have something going on, but the lack of it being stated in the movie is another reason for the flat characters. If they had built their relationship up it would have given their characters some depth and helped involve the audience emotionally. There were also many inconsistencies in the character's actions that led the me to question their integrity and the believability of the characters. Such as Saw being described as a ""extremist"" then when he was shown in a questionable situation where the city is blown up he quickly gives up, no longer fighting for his cause or his life. Secondly when Cassian is given the opportunity to kill Galen, he disobeys orders and doesn't follow through. Though as he later describes, he dedicated his life to the cause since the age of 6, and earlier in the movie he showed no problem in killing people. It shows the lack of depth in the characters that creates questionability in their true self and credibility. Overall I felt the movie lacked depth in the character development which was a major flaw in the movie. They didn't allow the audience to build the emotional connections to the crew that was vital in getting people interested in the movie. Due to this lack of character development, I wasn't phased when the whole cast was wiped out in the end by the death star. It just made the movie more boring as they weren't people I cared about or felt a connection to. In conclusion it wasn't a movie I was impressed in or would watch again."
" Different, but not Necesarilly Bad
",0.5824,-0.9825,2018-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Rogue One: A Starwars Story takes a largely different approach to the fantasy-like feel of past Starwars movies. Where the focus of earlier films was on the politics, jedi, and the force, this film follows a more realistic and war-like scene of the battle to retrieve the death star plans, as ships crash while trying to escape, and heroes commit controversial acts. On my first viewing of this movie, I was nearly thoroughly unimpressed. I say 'nearly' as K2SO did make me laugh. I found myself sitting down expecting to see lightsaber duels and chaotic masses of clones or storm troopers waging battle. I was then very disappointed when I found cinematic scenes that immediately took away the natural feel of a Starwars movie, poor character development, and practically no lightsabers! I did however, come back to watch it a second time, this time with a better idea of what I was getting into. This time I viewed it more as a war movie. What I mean by this is that the movie has a beach storming scene, and quiet reflective scenes, scenes exemplifying un-heroic deaths, and casualties galore. I came to like it on the second viewing as I accepted the more realistic take and came to feel the earlier movies were too fantastical, with one on one duels, and ship lifting with the force, etc. I do believe this story has flaws in how it fails to explain certain scenes and instances, however, also believe it did fairly well to describe the struggle of ordinary people in the fight for the galaxy. Instead of focusing on the Jedi, consulars, and emperor, this story focuses on people without grand talents, mainly people with simple blasters, ex-convicts, and even a blind guy with a stick. Overall, I believe the film was refreshingly different, even if the plot followed a very similar trend with daddy issues and the death star. It focused on a more realistic viewpoint of the galactic war, and on more realistic characters, characters that may not be wholly heroic for once."

After about ten minutes, I had absolutely no idea what was going on and quite frankly did not care.
How anyone can watch such utter shameless drivel is beyond me, so unless you are part of the depressingly large cult of star wars addicts I strongly advise you to spend your time on something substantially more worthwhile - like watching paint dry for instance."
" Mostly terrible with some decent space battles
",-0.6908,0.9933,2018-01-19 00:00:00,4,"I hated The Force Awakens but Rogue One managed to be even worse up until its redeeming final act. The characters are dull and boring. They have no life to them, no personality, no positivity. They could win a lotto ticket and still find a reason to be depressed.At least Rogue One isn't a remake of A New Hope the way TFA was. But it's story didn't interest me much. It has a lot of little references to the original Star Wars trilogy, perfectly matching the details. From the little black robot that buzzes around to the cool style of door that closes after Vader fights Obi-Wan in ANH, from the costumes and hairdos to the bright lights and machinery of the Death Star. But it lacks the life of the original movies. It's all style with no substance. Half the costumes look like they've just been made and are being worn for the first time. It lacks the dirtiness of Star Wars, where everything looks used, likes it been through a lot, even though it's futuristic.The music is terrible. Michael Giacchino has composed great music for Pixar movies like Up and Inside Out, but this score sounds uninspired. He references the first few notes of various Star Wars themes, only to fall flat with some other vapid theme. There's no impact, no energy. No chills down your spine moments like John Williams' scores are full of.The finale brought this movie from a 1/10 up to a 4/10. That's impressive. Parts of it are quite exhilarating, but only briefly. There are inspired shots that take you back to childhood for fleeting seconds. It's not because they imitate the spaceships from the older films, it's because space battles are exciting, especially when the effects, editing and cinematography are good. Having sophisticated vehicles juxtaposed with palm trees and a generally tropical location is also refreshing.Rogue One lacks the intrigue of the force. One character repeats the mantra ""I am one with the force, the force is with me."" over and over again. This is more grating than interesting. The story is often far-fetched, falling into a common problem where we constantly feel we're simply at the mercy of the writers. Maybe a character will dramatically die, maybe they'll have a miraculous close call, maybe they'll do that thing where they shoot and get shot at while having a conversation. The danger is only there when the script calls for it. It's shallow and inconsistent.What made the original movies so great was a combination of rare things: good characters, great music (amongst the greatest ever written IMHO), state-of-the-art special effects, iconic heroes, villains, vehicles and gadgets and good direction. At best, Rogue One has some sections of good special effects combined with good directing and some decent dramatic moments. But otherwise, it is woefully subpar for most of its running time, on the level of a TV show. I think it will age poorly."

But I have to say I came out of the film happy with the end product. Visually it was stunning and looked like a war film. While the plot wasn't amazing I enjoyed the new characters, with Donnie Yen's character standing out in particular, and really liked the new villains. I loved all of the references to the original trilogy, with the nod to Obi-Wan being a highlight. Sidenote both the Ewan McGregor and Alec Guinness versions of the character are my two favourites in Star Wars.And finally, the ending Darth Vader scene is easily one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a Star Wars film."

YIKES the hero is about to be killed, WOW he's been saved at the last second (repeat ad nauseam). There is a decent squid monster and a few nice touches. The white male villain puts in a solid performance. The geophysics of the exploding planet is very poorly thought out. BUT the kicker was at the end. The baddies know the plans to Death Star have been stolen and that the plucky rebels are on their way to the top of the transmission tower to send them - the main villain even watches them climbing up the tower with the plans. Now you don't have to be a tactical genius to realise that one simply has to destroy the big radar dish on top of the tower to completely scupper the rebels. Instead they try hunting them down inside the tower, blast these small moving targets as they run around the perimeter, confront them in hand-to-hand combat. ANYTHING but destroy the huge radar dish that will enable the rebels to transmit the plans. The Imperium is doomed."

Now after seeing it a few times, I can honestly attest that was because I was too stupid to see the forest for the trees. The plot blasted off leaving me in the dust. I told people I didn't like it, but the strange urge to see it again kept coming back, again and again.Rogue One is the first movie since the original Star Wars to make me well up with tears out of inspiration. The first act is a mess of loose, seemingly unrelated plot threads, and this is a detriment to the first viewing. But upon subsequent viewings, these threads are the beginning of something beautiful.The tone is the thick, oppressive cloud of the Empire and its forces looming around every corner. Characters are walking on eggshells to avoid attracting attention, vigorously going about their business or solemnly complying with invasions of their privacy... all this in the background as plot rolls forward. This movie is dense, the setting is alive.The pacing starts out at a jog, but slows into a brooding strut when things escalate and subtle characterization becomes more prominently noteworthy.The second act sees our ensemble cast through their devastating ties to the project and the devastation it leaves instigates discussion and a time for deliberation and action. There is some great character drama here. There is a gray moral area our characters must navigate, but it bears little consequence on the final act... but rather it serves as a tool for character growth.The structure between the second and third act makes for a cause and effect rather than a direct consequence. The second act is all about the events and character growth that will decide whether or not the third act is even going to happen. The third act is very much a rich emotional payoff to a crowded yet kinetic busy second act. The first act, for me at least, is given value through exposure to the second and third acts, which facilitates or necessitates second viewings. The threads scattered throughout the first act are merely plot elements being teed up at first glance, but in actuality, it will become retroactively apparent that there is a lot of subtle character set up here as well. So the structure is weird in that it folds back into itself. It is built to be watched again and again.I can't express how touching I find the main lead Jyn Erso's plight. The ending of this movie inspired me and moved me to tears. Every element of a classic Star Wars film is present and accounted for, and amplified to modern standards. This is Star Wars at its absolute best. It won't stand up to saga films, since it stands alone, but it is the best Lucasfilm has given us since the Disney regime started up.New characters will insert themselves at the drop of a hat, and it seems like this is nonsensical and lazy until you think about why it happens. It becomes clearer the more familiar you are with the film, which gives each viewing a new layer of information uncovered. The writers injected something I value immensely from the prequel trilogy, which was layered story-telling. Every time I watch it, I notice something new. This movie is a phenomenal middle ground between two divisive trilogies and a perfect bridge between Episodes III and IV.Visually, Empire and Menace were artistic monsters that pale any other installments in comparison. But in my humble opinion, this movie blows either film out of the water. This film has excellent framing and some truly unique points of reference that Empire really only touches once. The once stunning CGI cityscape of Menace's Coruscant are dwarfed by the mixed digital and practical set pieces in this film. The worlds in Rogue One are living and breathing, a true testament of the power of modern film-making.The side characters are charming once you get to know them. The themes are wonderfully illustrated through natural dialogue and action. The plot is solid. Any oddities in plot that one might notice upon first viewing will be ironed out with small details or simple imaginative thought the more small details are taken into account.Compared to its formulaic predecessor, this film is a masterpiece. As for where it fits into the episodic saga, it is a classic. This film alone is worth the Disney sell-out. Even if all the new trilogy films flop for me, I'll have one more phenomenally crafted film to add to my collection.I consider this film to be flawless."
" An excellent movie that is something different for Star Wars
",0.0258,0.9862,2018-01-06 00:00:00,9,"This is an excellent movie which breaks new ground for Star Wars, focusing for the most part on a band of unknown heroes rather than the Skywalker clan. It is suspenseful, poignant, hopeful and perfectly captures the feel of the era of the Star Wars galaxy just before ""A New Hope"". The Good:1. The Atmosphere - this is difficult to put my finger on, but something about the atmosphere of this movie is spot on for Star Wars. The director has simply done an amazing job of bringing the Star Wars universe to life, and making it authentic and believable. I suspect this has a lot to do with attention to the smallest details of the sort that the moviegoer doesn't even consciously recognize, but would have missed if they were not there. 2. The plot - gripping and suspenseful, it is also great fun as it answers those nagging little questions you might have from ""A New Hope"", such as why did the Empire leave a gaping flaw in the Death Star plans anyway?3. The visuals - stunning as I would expect from a Star Wars film, including the final space battle which is remarkably crisp and easy to follow visually even though it is all presumably CGI.4. New characters - from Jyn Erso to K-2SO, we are given enough time with them to get some sympathy for them as they face their destiny. We also are led to understand how much courage it took to be a Rebel facing off against the seemingly invincible Empire. Say what you will about the Rebels, but they all had guts. 5. Director Krennic - one almost feels sorry for this character. Yes, he is a slimy little weasel, but one senses that he began life as an ordinary joe and climbed the Imperial ranks through sheer merit, only to always be one step behind his competition including the icy and aristocratic Tarkin. His struggle gives us insight into the ambition and treachery that permeate the Imperial ranks. 6. The Death Star - a character in its own right, it was thrilling to see the original Death Star on screen again, with a powerful musical score to match. We even get to visit some of the same iconic locations from ""A New Hope"", and the awesome power and menace of the Galactic Empire has never been more clear. This is all the more so since unlike ""A New Hope"", we get to see and spend time on the planets (or parts of them) which are destroyed by this technological terror, which makes the emotional impact of the superlaser's devastation much more powerful.7. CGI Tarkin - some people didn't like him but I can't understand why. This was a thrilling performance, and it was great fun to see a classic cinematic villain resurrected on the silver screen. Peter Cushing's estate of course fully approved of this, and I am sure Cushing himself would be very happy to know that his performance was so well received and remembered that fans would want to see him return to the screen in this way decades later. 8. Darth Vader's Castle - this is something completely new and off the charts cool! (And also leads one to wonder if Darth Vader and Sauron share the same architect...) It appears to be on Mustafar, in which case it says a lot about Vader that he would deliberately put his retreat on the same planet where he lost everything - presumably so that he can relive his rage every day, thereby strengthening his power in the dark side of the force. This leads to the next point...9. Darth Vader himself - it was beyond awesome to see this legendary villain stalk the silver screen once again. Vader in this film is as he originally was, a monster feared across the galaxy. The last few minutes of the film as he faces off alone against the doomed Rebel Troopers are fantastic, and by themselves make this great film worth the price of admission. We can also all be thankful that we still have James Earl Jones with us to reprise his voice work, as there is no Darth Vader without that wonderful voice. The Indifferent:1. Not exactly different but mixed, was the appearance of young Princess Leia at the very end of the movie. This is meant to inspire hope, and normally would have, but sadly I happened to first watch this film in the theatre on the same day as Carrie Fisher's tragic passing. So, albeit this is a very personal comment, this final scene for me was very bittersweet and caused the film's high note at the end to fall flat. However, this obviously is in no way the film's fault, and presumably over time as the pain of her loss diminishes, future audiences will be able to watch her appearance in the final scene of the movie and feel the hope and optimism it is meant to inspire. I am quite sure Carrie Fisher would have wanted it that way.The Bad:1. Really there is nothing bad about this movie.Conclusion - you don't need to see this movie to make sense of the Star Wars legendarium but that said, if you don't see it you are denying yourself a richer understanding of the Star Wars universe, not to mention two hours of great fun!"
" Lame Characters and Overrated
",-0.4215,0.9357,2018-01-04 00:00:00,4,"I found that a lot of people loved this movie, but I sense it's just because they were happy to have another Star Sars movie. When I went to see it, I was excited because I didn't really like the first Disney Star Wars movie. At first I actually enjoyed the movie, they had managed to add a comedic robot who made me laugh. But not a single character ever laughed at the robot's jokes, and they all had the same personality; brooding and brave. Either the acting was really bad, or the writing formed some of the lamest characters I've ever seen. Either way it ruined the movie for me."
" A lot better than Episode VII
",0.4404,0.9854,2018-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I don't get the hate on this movie. It actually poses a great chance to introduce people who aren't Star Wars fans yet to the world, as it is the first completely independent movie, that introduces all characters seen. At the same time it does a great job at delivering the Star Wars world we fans know and love. The major reason why Episodes VII and VIII are bad in my opinion, is because they completely mess up the continuation of already existing characters from the original movies, they do a poor job at creating new characters and they consistently made the wrong decisions with the design, making everything look more cheap and childish. Don't even get me started on the horrible ""hero moments"" and ""punchlines"" that felt out of place.
On the other hand, Rogue One didn't do any of these mistakes. It perfectly delivers the feel of the Star Wars Universe, with more flashy effects of course, but without fundamentally changing parts that shouldn't be changed. Funny scenes are only placed where they are appropriate. Character development and behavior is the way we know it from the original Star Wars movies, but with new Characters and a new Story of course.The bottom line for me is: this movie is great for both people who have never seen Star Wars movies before, and for the people who have seen Episodes 1-6 and are curious what Disney has pulled of since buying the franchise. They managed to do a much better job on this one, than on Episodes VII and VIII."
" Best SW in a long time.
",0.6369,0.4601,2018-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Have to say, this was one of the best Star Wars movies in a long time. 
It pulls a lot together while being action packed and not full of any sort of happy and sappy ending. 
Gritty movie."

Script matters, having the guts to deal with political issues matters but moreover directing matters. Thank you Gareth Edwards."
" Solid Star Wars film - not mind-blowing, but doesn't detract from the originals
",-0.25,-0.9884,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Rogue One' (or ""Star Wars Episode 3.5"") is the first standalone Star Wars film (excluding 2008's CGI 'The Clone Wars' film), which is both its strong point and part of it's burden. It's hard to write a review objectively, since Star Wars is one of my favourite things ever, and almost every second scene is a reference to something from the Star Wars universe, so it's hard to imagine it from a context of someone coming in not having seen anything else Star Wars. And frankly, if you haven't seen the original trilogy, you need a good hard look at your priorities in life!I say this is like episode 3.5, but it's actually more like episode 3.9, with the ending leading directly into 'A New Hope'. The film centres on how the Rebel Alliance obtained the Death Star plans, that allows Luke Skywalker to blow it up. The introduction of Krennic (Mendelsohn), Galen Erso (Mikkelsen) and his daughter, Jyn (Jones) is done well, but there's not that much backstory. Basically, Galen's forced to build the Death Star, explain why there's a clear design flaw, and the rebels are sent on a frantic chase to steal the plans and get them to Princess Leia in time.There's a decent cast, with Yen & Jiang probably the best (even though I'm not sure you learn their names?), Rook (Ahmed) as the Imperial defector who grows in importance, Cassian (Luna) the rebel pilot who's had to do plenty of unpleasant deeds, and the droid K-2SO (Tudyk), who steals almost every scene he's in. Saw (Whitaker), Mon Mothma (O'Reilly), Bail Organa (Smits) and the CGI Tarkin don't have that much to do. There's obviously a few cameos, with Darth Vader getting two scenes. I did like the film, but I probably wanted to like it more than I did. It tries hard, but it's hard to connect with the characters, especially as we know how it's going to end. The best bits by far are seeing the new planets, the Death Star in action, the set-design/feel of Yavin 4 and the rebel fleet, and the space battle at the end."
" Movie title was mistakenly swapped with Marvel's
",-0.296,-0.8574,2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,"More properly titled as Suicide Squad, whereas the Marvel's should be called as Rogue Ones, nobody really got hurt in the Marvel's movie.
It's pretty good action movie with somewhat (not much) believable characters you could concerned at, about 7.5/10 if I would rate it.
But I don't like depressed ending with all those characters are dead, or as my kid said: ""a sad happy ending"". It sucks."
" very good
",0.4927,0.9153,2017-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie, the six rogues were all good. Ben and Felicity were fine actors in their roles.The action was good ,the plot was good."
" A Poorly-Paced Heist Film with a Thrilling (And Slightly Redeeming) Third Act
",0.4767,-0.9421,2017-12-31 00:00:00,7,"Set shortly before the events of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, Rogue One tells the iconic, yet never shown, story of how the Rebels got those Death Star plans that led to the station's destruction at the hands of them, ultimately igniting one of the most iconic story arcs in film history.Rogue One is a unique example of a film where the ending was written first, and it became the filmmakers' jobs to write a solid beginning and middle to help ground and justify a conclusion that audiences would be guaranteed to love. Unfortunately, it becomes apparent that this unique obstacle was a challenge for them.The first and second acts are a mess! The film establishes too many characters at once that would eventually form the core Rogue One team to initiate the Death Star heist, and, due to poor pacing, makes the characters' roles and positions in the storyline so ambiguous and convoluted that it becomes difficult to keep track who is who in the film, and who is doing what in the film's storyline. What was the pilot supposed to do? Who was he sent by again? Not enough time is dedicated to clarifying these details in this complex storyline; the lack of decent pacing leaves unanswered questions about our characters, and makes otherwise important characters appear useless to the storyline (Forrest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera, for example).It's only with the third act does everything that was confusing about the first and second acts start to make sense. Having said that, this heist film seems more like a mystery given the audience has to piece together the confusing parts of the first parts to figure out how they make the last part make sense. Maybe, by this time, who cares how they got together? We just want to see the heist! What I love about Rogue One is the fact that it manages to enhance the original Star Wars by providing a compelling storyline; by the end of Rogue One, you feel the sense of urgency that everyone on the Rebel ship in the beginning of Star Wars felt. The Death Stars plans matter, and it was about time we FELT why they mattered. The diverse cast accentuates the sense of ""group effort"" it took to extract the Death Star plans.The use of CGI to revive certain characters was distracting and unnecessary. I couldn't tell you what happened during certain scenes because I was distracted by the thoughts I had, mostly deciding whether I was watching a film or a video game unfold on the screen. The CGI is obvious and looks like a simple computer animation; no attention to detail could fix it, in my opinion. It was better to leave certain characters as cameos rather than give them full scenes and dialogue. Definitely the most cringe-worthy part of the film.For the nerds out there, I was blown away by Darth Vader's scenes in the film. Rogue One is finally the film that properly portrays how terrifying Darth Vader is as a villain; he's not just a man, he's a monster.Overall, Rogue One is a film that, from the start, has a fantastic ending. How the film gets to that ending is a bumpy road filled with poor pacing and underestablished characters, but everything falls together with a prewritten conclusion, making Rogue One a decent addition to the Star Wars saga for any film fan."
" Rogue One
",0.0,0.7614,2017-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Rogue One is a standalone chapter in the Star Wars saga. This movie takes place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and is about a rebel group called Rogue One, which steals the plans of the construction of Death Star (previously mentioned in the pre-text of A New Hope). Talking of positives, this film is beautifully shot. Many scenes and visuals were breathtaking, all credits to Gareth Edwards. His direction, like his previous feature, Godzilla, is fantastic and is probably the best in all of the Star Wars saga. This film continues the use of more practical effects which started with The Force Awakens, and I highly doubt this film will age visually atleast another decade.This film is unlike any other in the Star Wars saga. It darker, and isn't an ""epic"" film by any means, and I'm happy to see that they didn't try to make one, as it would make the film feel bloated.Coming to the script, the dialogues aren't wooden compared to the prequel trilogy, although there are some issues with the characters. None of the characters other than Jyn Erso are given a proper back story, so it's very hard to care for the characters. The father-daughter dynamic between Jyn Erso and Galen Erso is cliched, and Forest Whitaker's character, Saw Gerrera didn't impact the story much as he is killed off too early in the film.Cassian Andor's decision to join hands with Jyn Erso doesn't feel justified, and their chemistry completely fails, due to lack of screen time given for that. The side characters suffer from this as well, although the scenes are highly entertaining with them in it.Darth Vader's scenes are great as usual, although I wished to have more of him in the film. Since the stakes are much lower in this film, than any other in the Star Wars saga, it makes sense to have a lesser involvement of him in this film, compared to the OT.This is a pretty good start to the Star Wars spinoff saga, and I really hope they go on to make better ones.7/10"
" great star wars movie!!!
",0.3348,0.7955,2017-12-29 00:00:00,9,This movie is up there with the best of the original trilogy!!
" What Episode 7 and 8 should have been.
",0.0,0.9854,2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"I'll be plain with this review: this film fills the void that was created by Episode 7, and now Episode 8.To point out some of the negatives, the script is pretty basic, but on par with every other Star Wars film, so it works. The use of CGI characters may annoy some viewers as it is done quite a bit, but thankfully it is done well enough to not stand out. In fact, I would say that it would not be noticeable other than the fact that we know the actors are deceased or just older than what the film portrays. Finally, there are a few ""Easter eggs"" and nostalgic elements which makes the film a little too self-aware at times, but far fewer and more relevant than what we see in Episode 7 and 8.With that said, the rest of the film is excellent. The plot is solid, the characters are interesting and unique, the film is well paced, the humor is actually funny but fitting for a Star Wars film, and the seriousness of the story is never lost. The action sequences are well choreographed and fun to watch, and the ending leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. Some actors/characters that had been part of the prequels made an appearance, which was nice to see; I don't like the idea of ""forgetting"" that the prequels happened. I remember feeling a bit speechless and shocked when the credits rolled, because I had actually set my expectations really low thanks to the ""Episode 7 Effect"". Once I came back to reality, I felt a sense of hope that a fantastic Star Wars film was still possible. I personally believe that this is one of the top 3 Star Wars films ever made."
" Empty
",-0.2023,0.987,2017-12-28 00:00:00,6,"Although I thought Rogue One was ok overall, for a spin-off, anyway, it is among my least favorite Star Wars movies largely because it is the most unnecessary. Rogue One is clearly a better movie than, say, The Phantom Menace; however, in my opinion, Rogue One has the least merit of all of the Star Wars movies due to the fact that it is the most irrelevant to the overarching Star Wars narrative. It's a movie that really didn't need to be made and one that was, ostensibly, only made to cash-in on the Star Wars brand. As flawed as the prequels are, they give the original trilogy much exposition that it, for better or worse, would not have had otherwise. This exposition is nonessential and arguably even detrimental to the original trilogy, but it is nowhere near as irrevelent as Rogue One's, which doesn't shed light on all that much, and which doesn't answer any questions that really needed to be answered. In addition, neither the story nor the characters are very engaging. I can't recall a single moment in the movie where I sympathized or identified with any of the characters, and was disinterested in both the story and the characters during the great majority of the movie. The entire movie seemed inconsequential to me, like it didn't matter whether the main characters succeeded or failed, whether they lived or died. In its defense, I think it would have been extraordinarily difficult to have made Rogue One good. As a spin-off of off and a prequel to one of the greatest movies of all time, which really didn't need a spin-off/prequel, Rogue One was almost destined to disappoint.To conclude the review, I would like to clarify that I didn't dislike Rogue One. There are a few things to like about it. The CGI is amazing, for one thing, and the ending couldn't have been much better. The way it bridges the gap between Rogue One and A New Hope is perfect. That said, I still kind of wish Rogue One hadn't been made. From a business standpoint, releasing a sequel/spin-off every single year is a good move; from a business standpoint, I don't blame Disney at all; however, from an artistic standpoint, Disney's milking of the franchise and relentless marketing dilutes and cheapens the magic of Star Wars. There's frankly something concerning about the degree to which Disney is willing to capitalise on fans' seemingly insatiable appetite for new Star Wars movies. Rogue One is a stark reminder that Disney has already begun to convert Star Wars into something much like itself: a money-making machine, sleek and durable, but cold and lifeless."
" Re-imagining Star Wars
",-0.5574,0.2952,2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"When I first heard that there would be stand alone Star Wars movies, I was skeptical. But this film left me more optimistic. Seeing a Star Wars story without having to relive the structure/character/pace of the first seven was pretty freeing, actually. It was not necessarily original (plenty of old school westerns and war movies felt similar), but it worked. And just as Winter Soldier imagined super hero tales as a spy movie, Rogue One imagined Star Wars as a classic war adventure. The characters work, the homages are well done and I was sucked in. Plus, it answered some fun questions from back in the day. I just wish we could have avoided CGId versions of actors from 40 years ago."
" A Well-Done Addition to Star Wars Universe!
",-0.5983,0.568,2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"I will start with ""I AM A NEW STAR WARS FAN"", because of the hype for ""The Last Jedi"", I've marathon-watched the whole Star Wars from I - VII for 2 weeks and just today finished this. I must say it gives a quite good coverage to the whole story, I'm pretty fresh about it because I just watched Star Wars IV that follows what's told in this Rouge One.And I totally love this movie, why? It's because we can see how big is the Star Wars universe. Yes, I know some people are disappointed because there's no lightsaber fight, or not much Jedi scene, or whatever else. But I personally love the idea that focus on the point telling that it's not only the Jedi that contributes to the victory in the war. There are so much more of it and it gives life to Star Wars.I""d like to see more about it, not only the Jedi and Sith and so on, but the whole universe of Star Wars. I think that's what makes Star Wars very engaging, it's because of its universe. And I love the characters too, especially K2! I mean, guys, why not??? And may the force be with all of us!!!"

All of the bitterness was erased when this movie was released. It more than lived up to all the praise with stunning attention to detail, excellent acting, and a screenplay that never at any point disrespects the series. From the opening sequence to the thrilling climax there is never a dull moment. An extended version would be an added bonus. I hope to see one in the future. I am so glad that this film was made. Not just because it was great but also that it instilled confidence in knowing that a new Star Wars can be crafted properly and respectfully as opposed to one being done basically just to be the next ""Highest Grossing Film"". I want to see a good movie when a Star Wars film comes out. I really don't care how much money it makes.This one was brilliant."

" A fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga
",0.0,0.9972,2017-12-23 00:00:00,9,"I fundamentally disagree that this movie is a quick cash-grab with overloaded fan service. 
Right from the start, it is abundantly clear that this movie is extremely well directed and written, with an introduction of rich, genuine characters who all have strong plot arches. It feels like a 'star wars' movie right from the get go, with it's 'earthy' feel and focus on the everyday life of the universe's inhabitants. 
Obviously if you watch Rogue One, expecting a dramatic hero-centric Space Opera with 2.5 hours of lightsaber duels and X-Wing v TIE Fighter action you will be a little underwhelmed. This is not a Star Wars blockbuster, it is a Star Wars story - and a very good story at that. However, the battle scenes in this movie are actually really impressive and thrilling, far better than expected given that this movie draws its true strength from expertly capturing the raw essence of the Star Wars universe. To me, it does this so well that it goes above and beyond and you get a rich and exciting story that is genuinely really, really good. The characters are fantastic, all played by actors giving 10/10 performances - with exceptional credit going to Felicity Jones, Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn.Finally, it is REALLY awesome to see Darth Vader back on the big screen and this movie did it justice and a half. It could have been so easy to overdo this and ruin the character forever. Instead, this movie strikes the perfect balance of really honoring the character - giving fans an amazing scene at seeing him in his role of 'the enforcer' whilst also making this relevant to the story and not going off theme."
" Boring, boring, boring
",-0.7096,-0.6423,2017-12-23 00:00:00,1,"It took me three attempts to watch this movie. The first two times I just fell asleep. I only persevered because I'd been told the second half was less boring than the first, which I suppose was just about true, but only just. Zero character development meant that I couldn't care less whether the characters lived or died (as they randomly and pointlessly did). On the plus side I did get a nice couple of hours kip."

" A Gritty, Emotionally Powerful, and Dark War Movie that Perfectly Fits into the Star Wars Universe
",-0.128,-0.7984,2017-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a unique star wars experience that gives you the original trilogy feeling. The cast was perfect in all aspects and couldn't play it out any better. The action and conflict build up extraordinarily and set up 'A New Hope' perfectly while also attaching all loose strings together. The best thing is that Rogue One shows the dark side of both sides of the war by telling us that even the Rebels have made murderous mistakes throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the film rushes to some spots quickly and doesn't spend the needed time during certain scenes, which in turn steals development from some characters, who sometimes also felt rushed and didn't develop correctly to become the 'team' we see during the final act."
" Not bad
",0.431,-0.9831,2017-12-22 00:00:00,6,"This is a more serious Star Wars which went a bit silly starting in 1983 with Return of the Jedi and escalating with The Phantom Menace (1999), but Rogue One does away with silliness and gets down to business. The only thing I didn't like was Darth Vader's dark tower/castle (I'm nitpicking); in fact there's lots of nitpicky things I don't like about this film (maybe I'm just sick of Star Wars). Rogue One's action packed; you get your money's worth; especially the battle at the end, and the epilogue with Darth Vader kicking rebel arse. In comparison to some of the latter Star Wars entries Rogue One's not bad. Like another review said, Rogue One's a war film."

On the way she is accompanied by some guy with an accent, a robot, a defected Imperial worker-guy, a blind guy and his friend, and other stuff happens toI'm writing this after writing my review for The Last Jedi, and so far, this film is the only one I haven't got anything bad to say about. I know what the end goal of the film is and I know it's achieved, but the story of A to B was enjoyable enough. I wanna see that old rebellious spirit shine through the characters, and mostly it does.Tarkin and Leia, both brought back to life using CGI. Not at the point where it's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes realistic, but a good start, and no I didn't think it was 'disrespectful' to the actors or any of that; it's bringing the characters to life, not the real life people. I like Jyn, but there's nothing really deep or interesting about her.I liked seeing C3PO, R2D2, Darth Vader again, with Vader having one of the best scenes in the franchise at the end. The new 'engaging' characters, let's talk about them. Cassian Andor, he's just a guy, nothing special about him. K-2S0, the comic relief droic, he was fun. Definitely felt something when he was killed off. Chirrut and Baze; both fine characters. They were there pretty much to remind the audience that the force exists (well that, and to sign off on the diversity quota). I liked Chirrut's belief in the force aiding him through his blindness, and his whole ""giving Jyn hope"" arc. The defected Imperial pilot Bodhi was a little interesting, definitely gives you the realisation that some, if not A LOT, of empire members aren't actually evil; most are just doing their jobs in the face of being killed. That was an interesting idea to include. Forest Whitaker as Saul Gerrera, what a joke. Does nothing, and dies like a chump. A stand out character I guess was Krennic, but by the end I got bored of him, and I knew he'd die by the end anyway. It was also nice seeing Mon Mothma again.Overall, I don't love or hate this movie. I guess for the longest time fans always wondered ""who was it that got the rebellion the Death Star plans"", so here we are. It's the best Star Wars fan film to date. Could have had any characters or settings fill that mystery, and they did it well. Gareth Edwards did a fine job."

It feels new, because its darker and more grown-up as the old ones but it had the heart at the right place, the look and feel is so awsome and intense, Vader, Deathstar, the Imperium itself... even the alliance feels so impressive to me like it was back in the old days.And it shows me how terrible the new sequels are and how unbelivable it is, that all this films came out nearly at the same time in the same universe..."

Let's say that the story sits right to the Empire Strikes Back, but in my opinion, Rogue One is a better movie.
For me, it seems that Disney want to close Skywalker saga and to concentrate to new movie in Star Wars universe. We will see more about that when Han Solo will hit theaters.
Nevertheless, I will go again in cinema to watch The last jedi."

I suppose anything with the name Star Wars is going to automatically earn half a billion dollars because all the fans including myself just have to see it in the hopes that it will bring back the star wars magic we know of.

This was a simple adventure movie set in the star wars universe that does a fantastic job portraying the world as it was prior to a new hope, it has some fun characters and the writing doesn't do anything to try to say ""we're new star wars!"" which is great, since this is set in the era of the old trilogy and rather than try to break free of it, it compliments them.The ending felt a little rushed and it could have gone a bit darker in certain parts, fleshed out 1 or 2 characters but besides that it was a great addition to the star wars series."

First time I watched, found it enjoyable - 7, maybe 8 outta 10 - a good if not exceptional film. But on second and third viewing I found the characters and story to be highly involving - surprisingly so given the context. If there ever was a SW tale of good vs evil, people acting despite the odds stacked against them and a story that, even if you know what happens in the end, how it happens is perhaps the most important part - then this is a film that stands out in its own right."
" Whats the point?
",0.0,-0.5733,2017-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Throughout this film that what I was thinking 'Whats the point?'
I had been made clear even before the film was released that it was the run-up to episode IV, and would end with Leia being captured on the Rebellion ship with the Death Star plans.
So going into this I knew how it would end, none of these characters have anything to do with the rest of Star Wars, so they'll either all die before the end or just fade into obscurity and so who cares.Also the CGI Tarkin and Leia looked very plastic, and after the CGI Schwarzenneger in the new Terminator film I know it can be better.
Strangely they also towered over everyone else, regardless of how the original actors had looked.I understand fans of the comicbooks etc will like it as they see comicbook characters on the big screen, but why not have done a sensible thing by going further back in time and making this a trilogy? Maybe that would have been better, there's no shortage of material."
" Fun but shallow
",0.2846,-0.9789,2017-12-16 00:00:00,6,"Rogue One is an odd movie - going in, we all knew roughly what we were going to see: Rebel agents breaking into an imperial facility and successfully stealing plans for the Death Star. So there was no suspense in the outcome - we all know it, we know how the story ends. The film tries to build suspense in this - will the plucky rebels succeed? - but it is a wasted effort because we as an audience know that they do. Had this been filmed before A New Hope, then I doubt myself and others would be as critical, but it comes decades later and tries to fill a hole that, honestly, didn't really need filling.Then there are the characters. Oh, what a wasted opportunity they were. Aside from the droid, all are paper thin. The tragedy is that there are moments where you begin to think they're going to really flesh this motley crew out, make us care about them. ""I've been in this fight since I was six years old..."" from Cassian is a good example - they start to flesh him out and then you can practically hear the thud as they drop the subject. The same happens with Jyn, they start to develop her and drop it. The end result is characters who the audience has no connection with and thus no feelings for when they die at the end. We're supposed to feel sad yet inspired by their sacrifice, but instead because the characters are so underdeveloped there is no emotional weight to the scene.The story line is also rather weak - it is essentially a series of fetch quests from any generic MMO. Fetch the Imperial Pilot. Fetch Jyn's dad. Fetch the Death Star plans.And finally we get to the giant, glossy black elephant in the room. Darth Vader. His action scene at the end was fantastic. Some of his other scenes however... Darth Vader telling dad jokes? Really? Ten seconds that did almost as much harm to the character as Episodes one through three.Now, that seems like a lot of negativity, but the film is still enjoyable. It is well paced and tightly plotted, there is no wasted time here. You do feel the urgency of the time limit, especially in the last act. The visuals are fantastic and Scarif in particular looks stunning. The space battle is probably the best we have ever seen in a Star Wars film and showed the Rebels ingenuity; how despite being massively outgunned superior tactics allow them to defeat their foe.This isn't a terrible film, it just isn't great. It's enjoyable but has some very serious flaws, many of which could have been averted simply by investing the time to make us care for these characters."

Even the brightest daylight scenes are physically darker...oh, there were one or two bright scenes, but they actually detracted from the overall look. The acting is slower paced than all the other movies, and only vaguely fits into the Star Wars genre...This could be a stand alone movie, for none of the story really ties into the Star Wars Universe, as we would expect. Darth Vader does show up, but this time he is presented more as a Drath Veddar kind of character, heh heh...All in all, I did kinda like this one, simply because it was ultimately better than The Force Awakens...try it out, you might just like it..."
" The worst Star Wars film yet!
",-0.8398,-0.9869,2017-12-16 00:00:00,1,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a prequel to A New Hope. It Sees a group of rebels on a mission to thwart the Empire and steal the plans to the Death Star.On paper this was probably a good idea but it just failed in every way.
It's worth mentioning Disney Studios forced reshoots. Director Gareth Edwards quit and a new Director was brought in to finish the film, hence the uneven tone. It's filled with HORRIBLE CGI!! There are two characters recreated by special effects and they look like creepy bobble-heads.The actors are dull and forgettable.
The action scenes are boring and bad-looking.
The dialogue is weak and adds nothing.
Even the scenery is dark and dreary.
This doesn't look like a Star Wars film it comes across like a crummy generic dumb action movie.I find there's nothing redeemable about this crap fest.
I don't know how anyone rates it highly. It's completely pointless!"

If this was a story where they took out all the Star Wars elements and just made them generic Sci-Fi items, you wouldn't care. You might even feel a bit disappointed. And can we talk about ""Uncanny Valley Tarkin""? They used CGI to reproduce the late, great Peter Cushing from the first Star Wars movie, and he just looks creepy. (They also do a similar effect at the end with Carrie Fisher, which is equally creepy and not just because she died around the time this film was released.) So a character we don't care about gets involved in a plot to steal the Death Star plans, and the heck with continuity from the original Trilogy. Except the Death Star is already flying around blowing stuff up. Also, they make this movie a lot grittier and more violent, and yes, all the characters die at the end, even the ones introduced to make the movie more popular in China. Heck, I'm taking off another star for that one. Now, because Disney sees these movies as a way to rake in cash, we are going to get these ""Stand Alone"" stories between chapters of the new trilogy for years, I guess. But they really shouldn't."

What can I say here? Not much than was already said or written or speculated about. This is a very fine take with that inmistakable 70's look, Felicity Jones being a very cool main hero along with a stellar cast of many including Forrest Whittaker or Mads Mikelsen. The movie is long and loud, and sometimes it lack a certain depth or psychological development but it worsk okay and goes on at a great pace so the 120 minutes are not that excrutiating at all.

There's a lot of REALLY bad movies out there, and this certainly doesn't fall into that category. At least it's not another movie of comic book superheroes throwing buses at each other :-). I know, you've got your Star Wars fanatics who are disappointed that this somehow violates the rules of the SW universe, but personally I put it in the top 3 with Empire Strikes Back, and the original Star Wars. Here's why (in no particular order).(spoilers coming)an excellent bridge story between the creation of Darth Vader, and the emergence of Luke (of COURSE there's a Death Star, people, that's what this part of the saga is about, for Pete's sake!)a credible explanation for why the Death Star contained such a blatant vulnerabilitya strong protagonist who is neither apologetic nor exploited for the fact that she is female.K2SO the best comic relief of any of the movies - clever, a tad snarky, never stupid or over playedmale/female leads who eventually develop a mutual respect for each other (as opposed to falling in love at first glance)a darker, more realistic look at the cost of war (yes, the toll is bigger than one little Ewok friend)a look inside the politics of the rebellion (and without all the convoluted plot lines of the prequel trilogy)So ignore the haters, watch the saga in sequence (Phantom Menace, Attack of Clones, Revenge of Sith, ROGUE ONE, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, ...) and appreciate what a good movie this is!"

Rogue One is a prequel insert mini movie about how the Death Star plans were stolen and used in New Hope (Ep 4) to destroy the Death Star.The movie seems like a fantastic opportunity but the downfall of the movie is the script. Along with the poor casting and the silly attempts to ""Disneyfication"" of the Star Wars franchise I quickly lost interest in the movie before the plans were even stolen.I put an equal portion of the blame on the direction because the vision of the director is an interpretation of the writer. There are countless mistakes and continuity errors in the movie along with factual and illogical scenes. The ending being the worst of them all; as if they didn't even bother to check the original movies to keep continuity.I didn't like the CG of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin was also bad, but not as bad as Leia.This is a sign of things to come and with Force Awakens I see Disney doing a repeat of their princess motif for all their movies. I'm surprised they didn't CG big droopy sad eyes on the character, Rey, who was not only a weak character, but Daisy Ridley was poorly cast. Never before have I seen a more insignificant actress on the screen since The Human Centipede.Mark my words. Disney will continue to add yet another princess to their stable of commercialism, ignoring the possibilities that there are young boys out there who deserve just as much attention than princesses."

I would like to see this director, plus script/story writers, do all the Star Wars Movies if this is the result. The the essence of good vs evil ( the force) is brought back with new characters. The fact that so many of the characters died in the movie gives it more realism, grit and impact. The way it tied into the story line of previous first Star Wars release was cleverly done with appearances of past and present actors cleverly (CGI) done.

" Epic movie.
",0.0,-0.9769,2017-11-15 00:00:00,9,"This is how a Star Wars film should be; an independent free-standing movie and not just a copy/ re shoot/ of older Star Wars movie(s). This movie is obviously a ""fan- service"" movie, but it is able to stand on its own enough to be a regular, non-Star Wars movie. As war/ combat action-adventure movie, the pace is very quick, with nary a breath of respite in-between scene and location changes. Things happen so quickly it is easy to miss the details. For example, on Jedha, Cassian tells Jyn that his contact went missing. His contact isn't missing, Cassian kills him in a previous scene when escaping some Storm Troopers. There are a few sour notes. The use of CGI for Tarkin and young Princess Leia, for example, is absurd and pretentious. Why? It would've been better if they had real life, flesh and blood actors portraying Tarkin and the Princess. Do the filmmakers think audiences are so stupid that they have to be spoon fed a character that looks exactly like Tarkin or Leia? Or did they do it just because they could? That's an Empire-type arrogance, right there. Another sour note is Diego Luna's performance. He didn't quite gel to the character of a tough, vicious, hard-bitten, cynical, warrior. All in all, this is a good first step in reviving the franchise. Instead of retreading the old Skywalker story, this movie begins to open up the Star Wars universe to a broader feature film world, not just comic books and novelizations"
" An Honest Review
",0.5106,-0.9858,2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,"So, there seems to be two main points that the real haters are focusing on.1) Fanfiction 2) SJW propaganda.Now, I do believe these are both reactions to, well, The Force Awakens. The first just being a hatred for Rey, who was a Mary Sue and one that gave the entire movie a fanfiction feel.And where that is true for The Force Awakens, its not Rogue One, at least it is not Rogue One if we are staying in the Star Wars universe...it COULD be fanfiction if someone warped Saving Private Ryan into the Star Wars universe and...yeah, not, It's not fan fiction.The Second point, the SJW one, well, that could honestly also be a backlash against The Force Awakens as, yeah, anyone that called Rey a Mary Sue was accused of being a misogynist for, well...reasons.Specifically for reasons that had NOTHING to do with why they didn't like Rey--at least why most people didn't like her...most.And, in Rogue One, if the cast is multi-cultural of ominous political agenda reasons...it doesn't really feel that way. The diversity works and it works because you don't really notice it unless people point it out to complain about it.....and the people that do, yeah, it is likely because of The Force Awakens and they are forgetting that this takes place in a Galaxy Far, Far Away and, well, by definition they are all aliens anyway, so, you know, trying to force diversity in a movie entirely comprised of according to Hoyle aliens...wouldn't that mean a LOT more alien looking aliens? So, a lot of that is lingering from The Force Awakens and, well, some of it is understandable, if not for the movie itself than because of the backlash against people that thought Rey was entirely too perfect.Another reason for that hate could be a lack of lightsaber battles and, I really feel the fanboys on this one...but, no, really this was a Star Wars movie that felt like a war movie and the lack of blatant force powers and lightsabers until the very end worked...In fact it worked so well you did kind of get a Saving Private Ryan feel off the movie, a lone rogue squad taking on the entire Nazi?...Sith?...the entire Intergalactic Empire.It was really fun to watch and, not sense the Evacuation at Dunkirk that was the planet Hoth, did we see a Star Wars ground battle that really looked like it was a war. So this was pretty cool.And then there is Jyn. Now a lot of hate gores to her and I can't figure out why. She seemed like a real character. Rey could have been a feminist SJW transplant that was made super awesome because...reasons. But Jyn had serious flaws, she had issues, she seemed like a real person. So props to Felicity Jones for bringing that awesomeness to life.No, seriously, props to her. Outside of Solo, I really don't think I've seen a Star Wars character I thought was that, well, cool, real, just fun in the way that you could point to her and say ""I could know someone like that."" There were other cool characters in the saga...but none as realistically portrayed. And that doesn't just go for Jones.The only main character that doesn't seem like a real person was Chirrut Îmwe and, well, we can forgive him for that because he was the kung-fu movie awesome that helped make the movie not just a war movie in space. He was the guy that brought the Force into the film and made it a Star Wars flick...so, who really cares if he doesn't feel like a real person? I know I don't.And the last bit of hate is because, well, it doesn't have any of the real main characters, no Solo, no Skywalker and...well...it IS a stand alone movie, so if you came in expecting them, well, that is your fault. Disney made it clear from the get-go.What you have here is a cool science fiction war movie. It fits into the saga and it doesn't, but that isn't a bad thing--prequels, the Force Awakens--as only 3/7th of the saga movies are really any good.And, as a war movie, it stands on its own. It is actually better than a LOT of the war movies people tout as masterpieces **cough** **Thin Red Line** **cough** So, watch it, you should have no complaints......unless you are complaining about the SJW, the Fanfiction, and the lack of Skywalker or Solo, and if you are, well, there is going to be no pleasing you no matter what you watch."

I settle into my seat, there's the 20th century fox fanfare, there's the Lucasfilm logo and those famous words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" then... Alright come on where's my opening crawl? You can't have a Star Wars movie without an opening crawl! How will we know what's going on? No wait this looks Star Wars...ish! I settle back down into my seat and the magic begins to wash over me.Rogue one is definitely a Star Wars movie and a bloody good one too. Apart from the early planet hopping that is more distracting to the story than helpful the movie soon settles down to a nice pace where characters interact with one another and we begin to root for them. This movie has its own feel. It's more gritty, even grimy perhaps? The characters of this movie aren't squeaky clean heroes. They have a little more depth and aren't afraid to get their hands dirty to get things done. Diego Luna's character (Cassian) displays this early on when he kills a defenseless man by shooting him in the back in order to save his own skin. Felicity Jones's lead role of Jyn Erso isn't your typical female hero either. She is a survivor at first reluctant to get involved with the Rebellion. A person who through the course of the film becomes willing to give her life for the greater good. Donnie Yuen as Chirrut Imwe has a wonderful Camaraderie with Baze Maibus played by Wen Yiang. They are Guardians of the Whillis. Monks who once protected the Kyber temple on Jedha. The temple holds the key to the Death Stars destructive power. With no Jedi left, the temple has fallen into the hands of the Empire who raid it of its special crystal. Chirrut and Baze join Jyn and Cassian along with K-2S0, a reprogrammed Imperial droid with a team of rebel volunteers to steal the plans for the dreaded Death Star. K-2S0 played by Alan Tudyk is the superb comic relief this movie needs. A very welcome addition to the Star Wars universe unlike the extremely irritating Jar Jar Binks from Episode I. Mads Mikkelsen plays Jyns father Galen Erso, the man responsible for designing the Death Star. A man who's conscience overwhelms him when he realises the monster he has created and is then forced to finish his destructive masterpiece by the evil Orson Krennic. Ben Mendelsohn relishes the role of the dastardly Imperial officer and is one of the films stand out performances.Anyone familiar with the opening crawl of episode IV will already know the outcome of this film and the fate of its heroes, but it's the journey to where this story ends and A new hope begins is what is so intriguing. The story of how those Rebal spies stole the plans to the Death Star and helped save the galaxy. Without those band of individuals there would be no New hope.A difficult task for director Gareth Edwards to achieve was to make the audience care for the characters by developing them sufficiently within the movies run time. After all we haven't grown up with this bunch of heroes like we have with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie. Edwards does achieve his goal and has crafted a movie that slots perfectly between Episodes III and IV. As soon as this movie ends you'll be sliding A new hope into the Blu-ray player with an urge to see more Vader. Bringing me on to the point why most people will go see this movie. Darth Vader. The baddest bad-ass in the universe. One major disappointment with the prequels is that we didn't get to see enough of the man in Black. Except for that horrible pantomime end scene when he wails ""Noooooooo!!!"" If there ever was a moment that made me want to put my foot through my plasma screen then that was it! In Rogue one we get the scene we've always hungered for. Vader kicking some rebel ass like only he can. I swear when his lightsaber ignites and he starts slaying those poor dudes I was like ""Yes! Finally!""Rogue one is a good Star Wars movie. Possibly my fifth favourite fitting in nicely behind the original trilogy and The Force Awakens. It stands out though due to the way it was made. The special effects are designed to look reminiscent of those from the first trilogy. Not too much CGi polish. There's a practical realism to them. More miniature models than computer wizardry. There's a texture to the environments on screen. Unlike the green screen fakery used in the prequels. The whole experience is well worth it due to the love and affection that is apparent. Everyone involved in making this film has a deep devotion to the Star Wars universe and it shines through on to the screen."
" Rogue One is the Best Star Wars Movie
",0.1531,0.709,2017-11-10 00:00:00,9,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but Rogue One is the best Star Wars film ever made.I am a lifelong fan of the series and the EU. I've watched the trilogies dozens of times, I've played the games, I've read the books. After seeing Rogue One multiple times in theaters and at least as many times at home, it holds up and surpasses every other film. Gareth Edwards has directed a masterpiece.It took me a few viewings to admit that this was better than each of the original trilogy, including Empire. A lot of reviews complain that there aren't any memorable characters, but if Jyn, Cassian, Krennic, Saw, Chirrut, Baze & K2SO had been introduced and integrated into the franchise like other characters had, they'd be just as memorable. Their flaw is that they were in a one and done film.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this film includes not only the greatest ground assault, but the greatest space battle, and also the single greatest Darth Vader scene in the franchise. The original trilogy is amazing and revolutionary. But I think a lot of fans attach that nostalgia to how they rate and rank the films. Rogue One is incredible and it's time we admit it is the best Star Wars film.Also can we please get Gareth Edwards to direct more films in this universe?"
" I am sorry.
",-0.0772,0.8363,2017-11-06 00:00:00,6,"First i reviewed Star Wars: Force Awakens that i really liked. Now comes the time for a review of Rogue One. Ahhhh....what can i say. First let me just say this is not a bad movie. This time around the problem is in me. I just did not like it. While The Force Awakens was a very fun movie that i enjoyed i need to admit this one on the other hand i was bored with watching and i did not really like it. There were a few good laughs, an OK action scene and a pretty sweet ending. The movie itself, the middle just felt boring to me. I know this is not a popular opinion but i just wanted to say what i think. And that's is why this movie gets a 6/10."
" And the Modern Movie Continues To Decline . . .
",0.0,0.9933,2017-11-05 00:00:00,5,"(Spoiler Alert?) Where to begin? Let's start with the rating. At the time of this writing - November, 2017 - it stands at 7.9. 7.9??? Indeed? Just look and see what REAL movies have gotten a 7.9 on the IMDb, and then ask yourself whether this Cartoon comes anywhere near close. Admittedly, it is easy to understand why the Loser demographic might see it that way, and it would not be the first time a movie designed like this so appealed to 15-year-old future non-achievers (as well as those still living in their parents' basement at age 27), but it is completely out-of-line with the broad spectrum of movies made since The Great Train Robbery became the world's first feature film in 1903. Maybe the IMDb should have a dual ratings system: one for real movies, and another for Star Wars / Star Trek spinoffs. Essentially, this movie is a predictably unsuccessful attempt to merge the now-venerable Star Wars genre with the more modern explosion-and-grunge-fest genre where the stars are flashes of light and smoke that go ""boom"", and the Awards at the end of the year get handed out only to the special effects department. These are two different genres that this movie proves do not blend well (even if the explosion-fest offered anything to anybody other than a zit-faced adolescent male with a C-average). The former genre was light, breezy, optimistic, good old-fashioned melodrama; classic action-adventure with the the can-do spirit tone of classic action adventure. It eschews the need to tangle with much if any moral ambiguity, something the original Star Wars was noted for as a breath (actually, more like a WIND) of fresh air in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, post-1960's-mayhem world of 1977 when it was first released. The second genre is perpetually moody, downbeat, apocalyptic, oppressive, and frequently overwhelmed with moral ambiguity. Nobody is ever very calm or confident; the actors are scruffy if not utterly grungy; and even the girls are never really very pretty, either. (I have to wonder if this genre appeals to certain people because they, too, are perpetually downbeat and hopeless in their overall outlook, and such movies are something they can relate to.) Thus, the main characters here are almost utterly devoid of humor, much less any kind of love of life, as well as much external beauty. The result is that they are not compellingly likable, nor compelling in any other way. One could be forgiven for rooting for the villains, here; at least they were true to their warped souls and they certainly believed unambiguously in their own values, such as they were, as well as themselves (not to mention being impeccably well-groomed!)Perhaps worse still, basic story-telling gets lost in all the noise and smoke. With this movie, I don't know what happened, except that the good guys get what they are after in the end. But I can't tell you just exactly how they did that. The frenetic scene-shifting is just too fast and frantic for that. And in that, the movie fails utterly. The purpose of nearly any movie is to tell an entertaining story. Being ""entertaining"" means getting you emotionally involved. Here, the story gets too muddled to follow completely, and when that happens, it loses its dramatic (i.e., emotional) grip on the audience, and what should be a powerful, compelling, even epic story becomes a gigantic, expensive ""so what?"" While this movie does a creditable job of aping interesting combat moments from modern war movies from *Apocalypse Now* to the present, it doesn't matter. It is hard to get emotionally-involved enough to care what is happening on the screen for too much of it. Whatever deficiencies the George Lucas movies may have suffered from (George Lucas did NOT make this one), he never lost sight of that. And thus, in those parts where this movie stays true to its Star Wars roots, it has some of the classic Star-Warsian features that were so significant to elevating the franchise to the lofty heights of popularity it has enjoyed. The secondary characters are often very interesting and there are a number of clever lines and plot devices that showcase that; in point of fact, they are often more interesting than the main characters. The way they are included here also evokes a certain *Magnificent Seven* quality which is welcome even if it is not a classic Star Wars flavor. If there was anything wrong with them it was that in combination with the main characters and other supporting characters, there were too many of them, with too little time available for focusing adequately on each one. Moreover, the movie has the now-classic Star Wars look and sound (if mostly lacking in its feel). The music was not bad if not as prominent as is characteristic of the earlier films. The special effects were as good as they should have been. Appropriate cameos by major story arc characters and actors necessary to graft this story, which is after all a subsidiary one to the main arc, now drilled into the audience's collective memory with the power of over forty years' retelling, onto the main story line, is present. And in that vein the ending was of a kind that was was never so welcome as it was here, finally returning to and regrounding you in what a Star Wars movie should be all about in the first place (dare I say it: a prominent, upbeat and unambiguous tone of ""Hope""). Thus, I rate this at 5/10 stars: not a compelling should-see (7/10) nor even a completely technically competent yet slow or dull effort (6/10), but simply an expensive, epic bad idea."
" Innovation and the old Charms
",0.6705,-0.8171,2017-10-27 00:00:00,9,"The movie has had something new for a Star Wars, but still these unremarkable touch. I loved this film so much, because it shows the gross and raw side of the Star Wars Universe, combined with the old settings and some characters, that this is Star Wars. This is my first review and I don't know why I do this but it's kinda funny only the length is a bit too much for me."
" Rogue One - Not Just Visually Grand But Has Heart Too
",-0.1877,0.9601,2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I don't think any Star Wars movies I've seen(at least those released since 1999) thrilled me the way Rogue One did - it has all the characters (humans, droids, aliens from different planets) and all those space ships, weapons or mammoth space stations like the earlier releases that fascinates one about Star Wars but also, the effects and the dark tone really captured my imagination.And I don't mean dark tone in a negative way. To see many of the major Alliance characters fight bravely and die in their war against the Empire only made the story of Rogue One more believable and likable for me. Of course there were moments that didn't make sense or fails to convince but that didn't matter, it was an enjoyable watch from start to end. It was also good to see many popular stars among the cast like Mads Mikkelsen, Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen or Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn as the ambitious, military director Krennic is my favorite performance among the lot. But my best part of the movie is when Darth Vader shows up in the climax - that entire scene of him is only a minute long but must have got the loudest whistles in the theatres. Verdict - this Star Wars is dark, funny, emotional, feel good, suspense...whatever I wanted or more from an action adventure, science fiction in space. A big thumbs up."
" The episode III½.
",0.0,0.987,2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"So this is like a bridge between the original trilogy and the next three prequels. A story where the main characters from the original tale are not involved. Being a big fan of this franchise, I loved it. I did not expect big, so got entertained well. But pity that this wonderful characters are not going to return. This is just a one-off film. For seeing its overwhelming success, there could be a prequel, which has a very very slim chance.The story was like that had started in a half way. That's why I wanted a prequel to tell us the Galen Erso's point of view story. When he has been taken back to the base to work for the Empire, his daughter is the only one who escapes from there. After a few years later the grown- up daughter, Jyn, end up on the rebel's side. When she hints a plan for them to strike the Empire, nobody considers it. But a rogue gang forms where they all does according to her saying. That's the story, and how it all ends are the rest.The story was simple, but the action-adventures were good. Like what a 'Star Wars' fans want to see. The main drawback was there's no familiar faces around. Even the original franchise style of title and credit presentation was off the beat. Though there were cameos. Darth Vade, Princess Leia, R2D2 and 3PO, including a small lightsabre fight at the end, just to satisfy the fanboys. Overall a worthy film, otherwise it would have not earned one billion at the box office, making one of the top 10 of all time.8/10"

It was a true trip down to memory lane with the old storm troopers, Darth Vader and the death star.The surprise of it blending in to episode four had me in tears. I was crying an cheering all at once. I am a huge star wars fan and this movie gave me the feeling of remembering old love.The only downside to all of it was Tarkins CGI. It looked good but also a little video game like. I loved it and it amazed me what they were able to do, but it was a little to stiff for me.9/10 anyways!!Sorry for the bad English."
" Not worth the time or money.
",-0.1695,0.8063,2017-10-21 00:00:00,3,"Okay its not the worst film ever made but it's definitely not good. Film movies at a snail's pace, is overall terribly boring, the acting was pretty bad if not just awkwardly shameful, literally zero likable or memorable characters, but hey- of course it had some good effects! After all, an enormous budget and forcing this film into everyone's throats guarantees the return in investment so they can continue to churn out garbage like this for eons to come! I'll say the Darth Vader scene gave me goosebumps for sure, they won my old man's mind on that regard, but that's really the only good moment in the film and many of my friends agreed, and they grew up idolizing star wars like I did. And back to the acting, I get it that sci-fi films don't usually have any good acting, but you'd think with the money they're putting into these films and getting back from them, they'd hire some people who can actually act a little bit? Come on."
" Lacked Some Action But Still Extraordinary
",0.0,0.9642,2017-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Lucas's movies has always engulfed millions of fans in his ideas and vision of the universe. Despite the fact that Star Wars was created about 40 years ago, films dedicated to the series are still being made and fans from different eras come together to celebrate the never-ending thrill ride. Yet, out of all 8 Star Wars films, ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" started off strong and ended off even stronger. Through spectacular visuals and sound and the outstanding creativity and originality lies a plot with purpose of acting as a bridge for the older Star Wars films. ""Rogue One"" is critically acclaimed for its stunning use of digital imagery and computer- based animation. Viewers are enraptured by the realism Garett Edwards achieves, especially through the vivid details included in CGI. In the movie, General Tarkin, the ruthless military power seen in many previous Star Wars films, speaks in his usual demanding and condescending demeanor to Director Krennic. To most viewers, Tarkins appears so realistically that no one would suspect he is merely a collection of millions of pixels rather than an actual filmed actor. State of the art technology is implemented to create realistic effects that seems almost real to the viewers, making them feel part of the Star Wars universe. Yet, the most human aspects of the ""Rogue One"" story is told through the perspicuous portrayal of emotion by the actors. The actors played their roles superbly. Their motions, facial expressions, tones, and volume of their voice all matched perfectly together, making their characters truly come to life. There are many amazing actors in the film, they even brought in the legendary Donnie Yen, an actor famous for the movie series known as ""Ip Man."" His character is Chirrut Inwe, a blind ""monk"" who uses martial arts and a staff as his weapons. This allowed Yen to really get into his character, fitting into a role he is most comfortable as: being a martial arts bad***. Another amazing actor would be Ben Mendelssohn who played Director Krennic, the villain. He outstandingly fits his role as a short-tempered and selfish character. He portrays Krennic's nature perfectly during a scene when General Tarkin proclaimed that he would tell the emperor the success of the Death Star; however, viewers could clearly see Krennic's facial expressions twist in frustration and anger. He even glares sharply at Tarkin and shouts, ""We are standing here amongst MY achievement."" Krennic even had spit spray in the air as he yelled this words making his acting all the more better. ""Rogue One"" proved not to disappoint by providing actors and actresses who not only could play their role, but also become their role. Through everything Star Wars is adored for, from its sound to its visuals to the acting, one thing fans could thank ""Rogue One"" for is the comedy. It has always been a Star Wars tradition to implement comical scenes here and there to lighten the mood for viewers and get a few good laughs. To be honest, there are lots of comical scenes in ""Rogue One"" that is worth bringing up, but it is better to just say a few hilarious scenes to not spoil all the good parts of movie to those who have not watched ""Rogue One"" yet. One very funny scene in my opinion occurs in Jedha. When the Death Star shot its ominous green beam into the planet's core. For the first time, Star Wars fans get to see the destructive power of the Death Star at ground-view level. That is what ""Rogue One"" did so well, giving everything the fans wanted. As imminent death approached, Alan Tudyk otherwise known as K-2S0, a re-wired imperial droid, jokingly stated, ""There is a problem on the horizon.there is no horizon."" Star Wars has always slipped in a few witty jokes and funny scenes in all their movies. Those little actions just make the movie much more memorable and helps loosen up tension. In fact, ""Rogue One"" had funny moments occur at the perfect times. There have been movies like ""Don't Breathe"" who inappropriately brings up jokes that just spoil the mood and atmosphere. Yet, ""Rogue One"" did none of that, the funny scenes were used to lighten the mood and progress the story. The reason why ""Rogue One"" was able to obtain a worldwide gross box office sale of over $1 billion was because the movie was used to explain how ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" all began. ""Rogue One"" delivers to story-line of dedication, hope, and sacrifice. It is the type of movie that you would never expect Star Wars to have in its franchise, yet it has so much importance to it. ""Rogue One"" has kept the nature and concept of the Star Wars franchise, something many Star Wars fans can appreciate, but just added new characters to fall in love with. Of course, ""Rogue One"" could not beat the original Star Wars films in the original franchise in terms of rating, but it still holds a special place in many people's hearts because of how the movie kept the people at the edge of their seats and was able to grab their attention all the way throughout. Truly in my opinion I believe everyone who has not watched the Star Wars franchise yet should watch the entire series from beginning to end. I will admit to being a Star Wars fan myself, but I genuinely believe that non Star Wars fans will come to love the franchise as millions of others around the world have."
" Formulaic plot but reasonably entertaining
",0.5927,0.9869,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Set immediately before Episode 4, Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso, a senior scientist for The Empire. They have not seen each other in 15 years. Due to her father's position, Jyn is liberated from Empire imprisonment by the Rebel Alliance. Word has come to them that he is helping build a weapon that tilt the balance of power firmly in favour of The Empire - the Death Star. Reluctantly, Jyn is drawn into the struggle.Pretty formulaic but reasonably interesting. Set up is pretty basic and plot feels implausible and contrived at times, plus the characters are not that engaging. Character depth, engagement and soundness of plot are not what this movie is about. Action scenes, adventure and CGI are, and here it does pretty well. Quite exciting, with a momentum that keeps you watching. Does degenerate into fairly predictable fight scenes and plot development towards the end though.Overall: okay, and on par with Episodes 4-6. Certainly better than Episodes 1-3, though this is an easy feat."

Even that cameo from Darth Vader and my favourite, C-3Po, made it fun. Some of the deaths were a bit weird. Bodhi Rook could have survived if he had kicked the grenade out the ship he blew up in. Losing K2 was like losing C-3po. Let's hope they do Star Wars 8's new characters like that instead of not giving them a back story like with Poe Dameron."
" So Underwhelming
",0.0,-0.9682,2017-10-13 00:00:00,3,"So no spoilers from me think this time. The movie is a spoiler on its own. Really, really disappointed. Been a fan since the very first Star Wars in the 70s. I remember standing in line in the summer heat for hours. No way would I have endured five minutes indoors with air conditioning to see this one.So I understand Disney bought the franchise and it shows. Disney took an epic sci-fi series and made it less than mediocre and no more than a cliché for the pc lovers at Disney. Oh the special effects are there for sure. After all George Lucas's company handled that part of things but the rest?? Very little to attract the fan of the series. No one with the force, no Jedi nada. Just very boring script and barely watchable acting. For me watching it was painful. Being stubborn and because I spent money to see it persisted to the end. ArghSo for this old fan - nothing to get excited about. I did notice it went right to Netflix which should tell you something. Perhaps as a standalone film with no Star Wars connection rated against other sci-fi films of the year I would have rated it higher, if for the special effects alone. But trying to tie is to the success of the Star Wars series and throwing a two hundred million dollar budget at it?? Sorry not for me."
" Rogue One Review - Out of this World!!
",0.0,0.2236,2017-10-13 00:00:00,9,"The movie's plot takes place between the third and fourth Star Wars films, and shows the story behind rebel soldiers attempting to steal the Death Star blueprints in hopes of destroying the new Death Star. The film did a good job of staying true to the story, even though it was considered a filler between. It was a little too slow at the beginning, and we didn't see a lot of action until towards the end of the film, but it was understandable in that it helped with the character building. It also stayed true to the lore. It added new elements, but still managed to fit into the universe of the star wars story. With regards to lore, it takes certain characters from the Clone War cartoons and incorporates them into the movie, like Saw Guerrera. It was well woven into the overall plot of the stories, and gives you a better understanding of questions that were left answered when the original films came out, i.e. how did they manage to get the Death Star plans? Which the diverse cast of people that were involved boosted the authenticity of the film, the cast were individuals who typically weren't involved in a science fiction type story, which made some characters, like Forest Whitaker, seem out of place. The overall feeling of the movie was more gritty and darker than the other Star Wars films. Because LucasFilms is now partnered with Disney, I didn't anticipate such a grim ending where everyone dies. The cinematic shots were very enjoyable. The film had a lot of good writing, and it wasn't just saved for the stars, even smaller characters. The writing brought on a lot of emotion and allowed the audience to connect to film more emotionally. The composer of the score was different from John Williams, who originally scored the other Star Wars films. The score was different from what John Williams normally does, but it did embody the Star Wars music that we've heard in the past. Closing Thoughts - While the film was innovative in many aspects, it still managed to give Star Wars fans what they wanted. It did a great fan service to the audience, and was a spectacular addition the Star Wars film franchise."

There were scenes in the trailers that weren't even in the movie. Why? What happened? If you are a big enough fan you knew everyone was going to perish in the end. But even knowing this, I didn't care about any of these new characters. Any backstory gets glossed over quickly. One really good scene was when the main antagonist goes to Darth Vader's castle and it shows how intimidating Darth Vader can be, but still who doesn't know this by now?Saving grace: Darth Vader's 30 second scene at the end where he's kicking ass like the boss he is."

It has some SW elements, and is entertaining enough, but it seemed kind of disjointed and pointless. It feels like playing the old Battlefield video games, which is OK, but it lacks the depth and continuity and nostalgia/epic feel of the gritty Star Wars saga.Younger viewers, like my son, will love this film, and I can watch it as well(I have twice), but it just seemed kind of silly when you get serious about the SW universe.Why did we need to see all this hooplah just to find out that some scientists left a flaw in the Death Star? I mean, yeah, I guess it was an OK idea, but it just seems like one of those fly-by-night episode ideas that writers throw in for a filler episode-- only with excellent effects/visuals and a decent cast and diversity for effect. Every SW now needs a young female as the lead, and seems to just be cashing in on the SW name-dropping and young kids getting sucked into the hype.

" Star Wars for the rest of us Muggles
",-0.5574,-0.998,2017-10-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie deviates from the Star Wars Episodes as it shows parts of the wars that ""ordinary"" heroes fight, non-Force users (I am tempted to say ""Muggles""). No Jedi magic and no light sabers, people have to fight with normal blasters, ""the better times"" of the more elegant light sabers are long gone.So don't expect the usual Star Wars magic, but prepare for more like an earthly war movie, sprinkled with Star Wars goodies like X-wings, Star Destroyers, and, of course, the Death Star. Brand new, being tested, supervised by Grand Moff Tarkin brought to screen by a computer generated, almost believable Peter Cushing.The story of Luke is told yet another time; young Jyn loses her family which runs a desert farm to the Empire, teams up with some rogue pilots and a sarcastic talking android, to learn about the Death Star and fight it. Same story, much rougher environment, no noble knights but fierce warriors, less space battles but more boots on the ground. And as I said - no baroque-style saber duels but 21th century warfare in Arabic-esque cities. And not even the clear line between good and bad - the Empire is on an understandable mission to restore order in the Galaxy, while the rebels question themselves.At the end, the young heroine succeeds without using the Force, she steals the Death star plans and sends Princess Leia on her legendary mission to bring them to Alderaan, closely followed by Darth Vader, who like Tarkin and Leia looks a little CGI-ish.No question that this is a movie worth seeing and owning, and I am excited about this spin-off which gives Star Wars a true Earthly touch.There is one thing however that I would like to remark (SPOILERS AHEAD). We all know of the flaw of the Death Star: Too much power in one center, which is prone to explode if it is hit. This is the same error the dark side does over and over again: The droid army invading Naboo, both Death Stars and Starkiller Base - all suffer from being too centralized, not being distributed, not being redundant - they all are Single Points of Failure. This is the nature of the dark side, of the Sith: they gather around a powerful, authoritarian center, a dictator, a Big Brother who is meant to be the wise and powerful. Yet the dark side keeps failing because centralism and egomania is not the way you succeed, or how societies live in happiness.Or so the franchise told us.In Rogue One we learn that the flaw of the Death Star was intentionally built-in by an engineer working for the Empire but feeling for the rebellion. He built in a weak spot and documented it in the plans.Now, not only that this means the ""hope to find a weak spot"" expressed in Ep IV was rather a certainty. Also, this implies that the Empire only falls by treason. Centralism works, the movie tells us, if it were not for traitors.But that is wrong! The Death Star does not HAVE a flaw, it IS the flaw. This aspect is totally ruined by the treason story. If that one engineer would not have been a traitor, the Death Star would have worked. This is contrary to the message the other films brought.What a pity, another of these plot twists that have the power to ruin your childhood memories. But on the other hand, nothing is more typical for Star Wars than constantly contradicting itself.9/10, a great movie."
" Rogue One, but not the first Star Wars tragedy

While the actors in the original trilogy weren't quite the major league except for the few ones, with the downfall of the standards they can certainly give the new 'promising' faces in the cinema industry a lesson or two. Felicity Jones is painful to watch - who called her an actress, actually? Diego Luna is nonexistent, nothing to be gathered about his character revealed by the acting. My gosh, Forest Whitaker whom I enjoyed in some of the very silly movies like Species, caught something from the rest and is cardboard AF. Maybe a 'death' of a robot, a lame C-3PO substitute and a forced comedy effort, was the most dramatic death of them all. That should certainly give an idea of how much the actual characters don't deserve a single *** to be given.OK, 1 star for being slightly better than the Farce Awakens. 1 star for not flawless, but bold effort to reconstruct Peter Cushing with CGI. 2 stars for the non-typical for the main saga cruelty, only the Expanded Universe had the balls to show all sides of the story before, that's why I loved it so much. 1 star for Darth Vader presence, with James Earl Jones voice, as it should be, but there's something off about him actually. 1 Star for the last 40 minutes of action. Minus 1 star for SJW agenda - I don't care if they're white, black, Hispanic, Arabic, men, women, straight, gay, if they can't act to save their lives. Minus 1 star for the forced dialogues, worst of the lame video game mission briefing kind, and may the Force be with you if you actually lived through a single one of them."
" Thoroughly Disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.7614,2017-10-04 00:00:00,5,"I don't know why some many people thought this was a good movie. The writing is terrible. There is no character development. They don't even have so much as a personality, each character is just the bones of an overused trope. I couldn't tell if the actors were good because their interactions with one another were so unnatural. The main character's only defining characteristic was her relationship to her father, who had no personality either. Because all the characters were nobody, when they started killing them off it wasn't emotionally impactful at all.Rogue One had no worldbuilding to it at all, which is one of the things that made Star Wars so appealing. At best there's the introduction of a couple of new-looking droids and aliens in the background. Visually, it didn't look great. Of course the effects were fine, but many scenes had a muddy look as if large portions of them were blurred to look good in 3D. Rogue One made me decide I don't want to spend money on another Star Wars movie or merchandise because it's so clear Disney is just going to start churning out low quality movies year after year, trying to milk as much money as it can out of the Star Wars franchise before it becomes a joke."
" Almost as bad as Episode VII The Farce Awakens

Of course so is JJ Abrams and his remake of Episode IV. That film was a truly lying ersatz insult to all the fans and cinema goers. This one at least show some action, but let's face it the 5 minutes aboard the space ship that shows what happens before Princess Leia was captured is not worth it and just made for Disney to make cash.I believe I am done with Disney and this series."
" The Best Star Wars Film To Date?
",0.1531,0.9002,2017-10-01 00:00:00,9,"I went into the movie theater not expecting much to be honest. After the disappointment that was episode 7, I was honestly expecting Disney to ruin this one too. I could not have been more wrong. This film was pretty gritty for a Star Wars flick (Which is a good thing). There were a few things wrong with it, but no glaring plot holes such as episode 7 and none of this the good guys win yet again feeling. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and I hope the Star Wars films following this one are as good. How does it compare to The Empire Strikes Back? Honestly... I think Rogue One is better..."
" Well It Had That McDonalds Feeling
",0.3818,-0.7569,2017-10-01 00:00:00,2,"This film felt like McDonalds. How so? One gets the feeling that it should be watched so after some time I ordered the DVD and watched it. You know how one has a pang for a Big Mac once in a while for no good reason other than addiction to what is bad and advertising? That is Rogue One! After watching it I knew I had been had, the film was mediocre and forced and my brain regretted it (at least I didn't have an unsettled stomach feeling like with a Big Mac).The truth is one knows he or she is being manipulated into the price of a DVD by Disney. There is as much a need for this film as there is for Episode VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, the side story about Han, the side story about how Yoda got his ears, the movie about the day Chewbaca's second-born lost his hair (oh those Tabulian fleas!) and how Chewie fought to get the right medicine, the prequel about Luke's 'uncle' and the agricultural school he went to (although that blonde one in Irrigation 301 in the micro skirt was indeed very very hot - she may now get her own movie), the crossover movie in 2024 about how Darth Vader met Moana one time and let me tell you that was some steaming sex (although the general consensus is that the singing was bad), etc etc so on and so forth yadi yada yaa.Disney will not stop until there is no one at the cinema... at which time it will be reboot time again.Rogue One itself was quite dark and I kept increasing the TV's brightness. This was a fault I had found with the prequels as well. The story was convoluted and I found the human soldier domino chain aboard the getaway spaceship unnecessarily comical. The physics did not add up either. One second Darth is five steps away and the next the getaway second spaceship is already a kilometre out. The worst was the lack of Force and Jedi in this universe.I believe I am cured of Star Wars. Well, that is not true I will repeatedly go back to episodes IV, V and VI as I have for years, but future Star Wars and me are probably like McDonalds and me. We best avoid each other."
" Good to see a story outside the classic Star Wars saga
",-0.1779,0.9481,2017-09-29 00:00:00,7,"It was good to see a story outside the classic Star Wars saga for once. The movie had a great cast and great potential. The story worked itself up to the climax a little too slow to my liking, but the third act makes the wait worthwhile. Despite the fact that the ending was a little bit too dramatic for me and took a chunk of credibility out of the movie, it was still a good and satisfying movie."
" Constanstly Consistent
",0.0,0.8837,2017-09-27 00:00:00,9,"I have always been a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise and I have never been let down with any film that has come from Lucasfilms and event the more recent ones that co-produced with Disney after Disney bough the rights to Lucasfilms. Rogue One was amazing, it kept that consistent Star Wars feel to it and it had everything that a Star Wars film should entail in it. I never once found myself drifting or being distracted by something else around me, it immersed you into the film, by showing you the background of the main characters and also by allowing you to get to actually know and understand them. This is what's so great about the Star Wars franchise you get to actually know the characters and you are able to feel like you know them on a personal basis through the magic of film. Anyway back to the review, it was action packed, entertaining, funny and out right brilliant. Although the droid was not a main character I found him hilarious through his sarcasm and how pessimistic he is. Highly, highly recommend this to anyone I encounter.

The main protagonist was a sap.Even the action scenes were dull and repetitive, it was like watching transformers 3.Never again, don't believe the good reviews people.Awful!"
" A worthy addition to the beloved series
",0.7351,0.9584,2017-09-14 00:00:00,8,"I saw Rogue One on the big screen when it came out and again on TV last night: the former was spectacular, the latter convenient (especially pause and re-watch functions). Rogue One is (IMO) by far the best Star Wars move to come out since the original trilogy. The story works – skillfully linking a new 'parallel' tale to the canonic original, thus avoiding the usual problems that often arise with sequels (trying to revisit, and redefine, original characters) and prequels (often adding unnecessary and unpopular backstories). The acting and script are excellent (for an Sci-Fi action flic), as are the special effects. Peter Cushing's simulacrum looked better on the small screen (although Carrie's Fisher's still looked like it had crawled out of the uncanny valley). There were a few slow moments and some excessively improbable events, but all-in-all, a worthy successor to the originals (which, of course, also had slow moments and excessively improbable events) and a great addition to the much revered Star Wars mythos."
" The Prequel Star Was Never Knew It Needed
",0.0,0.9991,2017-09-10 00:00:00,9,"I'll be the first to admit my lack of faith in the success (critically more than commercially) of Rogue One. As a fan who, like many others, live and die by Star Wars, the initial idea of a live- action film spin-off seemed risky. How ever was my lack of faith disturbing. Rogue One not only delivers a highly compelling, exceptionally entertaining film of its own accord, it undoubtedly strengthens the story of A New Hope (Episode IV), and the entire Star Wars saga as well.This was no easy task for director Gareth Edwards and his staff of writers; to be trusted to produce a worthy spin-off story in arguably the largest franchise in the world is a daunting undertaking. The conclusion was to tell the story of the rebel team who stole the original plans to the Death Star, a team we had heard about in Episode IV but never got to see. There simply could not have been a better choice for the plot of Star Wars' first spin-off, as Rogue One contains one of the best individual stories in Star Wars history. There is a much grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling to this film, but even with the more grounded atmosphere, it still very much feels like a Star Wars movie. We see a new approach to the storytelling; new worlds, new characters, new stakes, and we also see classic vehicles, characters and more. It's a shot of fresh air into the lungs of what fans have come to expect, yet maintains the heart of a Star Wars film. Seeing the touching sacrifices that each member of the Rogue One team makes is powerful and enticing, making character connections to the audience that strengthens the depth of the film. The pacing was excellent for the most part, with some minor hiccups here and there. Possibly the greatest narrative strength, however, belongs to Rogue One's ability to tie into A New Hope flawlessly. This is, after all, a prequel film to Episode IV, and with it the foundation of A New Hope shifts heavily in the best way possible. We get so much more insight on the events of Episode IV, including an explanation to arguably the biggest plot hole in the entire saga. All throughout, Rogue One secures a spot among the best stories ever told in the galaxy far far away.As good as the story is, Rogue One's undisputed backbone is the phenomenal set of characters leading said story. The ragtag squad that is Rogue One is filled with wonderful characters, lead by Jyn Erso who is fantastic. The real stand out, however, is K-2SO, a new droid who constantly makes you smile, providing wonderful comedic relief. The new set of characters are rounded out by rebel Cassian Andor, solid new antagonist Director Krennic, Jyn's father, Galen Erso, and the awesome duo of Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus, who have great on-screen chemistry. These new characters are terrific in Rogue One and help further the roster of lovable Star Wars characters for fans to cherish.Though Rogue One introduces new characters, it's some of the age-old classics are show stoppers. Aside from Darth Vader (who I'll get to shortly), the digital recreation of the late Peter Cushing's iconic Grand Moff Tarkin is a staple of the film, and is executed brilliantly. We also get to see Mon Monthma, Saw Gerrera, Bail Organa and even a brief shot of Princess Leia herself, who also was digitally redone for her short scene. Seeing the connection of new and old characters is splendid and to see them all bridge the story into Episode IV is even better.The actors themselves bring each character to life beautifully. Felicity Jones is solid as Jyn, Alan Tudyk plays the voice and mo- cap of K-2SO perfectly, Ben Mendelsohn is aggressive and intimidating as Krennic but the gold star goes to Guy Henry, who, aided by CGI, recreates Tarkin so well that it's almost indistinguishable. Without going on too long, the cast was excellent from top to bottom.Of course, Star Wars is known for its big-budget action scenes, stunning visuals and masterful audio, and Rogue One continues the legacy of what to expect from a Star Wars film. The action sequences are intense, exciting and intriguing, especially in the third act with the superb final battle between space and on land. The different locations give way for gorgeous set pieces and CGI, and while not composed by John Williams, the score fits the style of the film and keeps the Star Wars feeling intact.It'd be a disservice if I didn't dedicate a section to the final scene of the film. Darth Vader, one of the most legendary names in all of fiction, makes his triumphant return to the saga in Rouge One, becoming the center of what is one of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history. Vader boards the rebel ship which holds the stolen Death Star plans, and in desperation to retrieve them, Vader mercilessly slaughters numerous terrified rebels in his path. The iconic glow of his red lightsaber, his overwhelming power of the Dark Side being showcased to a maximum, this is the Vader every fan has dreamed of seeing. The scene completely stole the film, and also lead directly into Episode IV, giving it legitimacy as well as being down right epic.The Star Wars galaxy is large with many stories to be told. Rogue One might not traverse too far away from the original trilogy, but that doesn't for one second keep it from being an astoundingly entertaining piece of film and a more than worthy entry into the prestigious Star Wars saga.9.5/10"
" Overwhelming movie
",0.0,0.9786,2017-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Saw this movie tonight on German sky pay TV, expected an fx focused / headed prequel to the 1977 movie. The old movies where focused on the story, fx was a helper, not the focus, that changed in episode 1, clone wars and the sith movies, my opinion, they just closed the story line. Rogue One is the absolute revival of the old movies and a perfect prequel to the original 1977 movie. The story is the main focus and extremely intensive like the first movie and empire strikes back which are my all time favorites, saw both at that time more than once in a Buenos Aires cinema, and I'm adicted to science fiction since then. Fx just helped the story look better. This is why I also love Star Wars Rebels hoped this series would keep longer, 4th season is last and shorter than awaited. Back to Rogue One, I am really impressed, this one makes it to my all time favorites. I would have watched this one in a 3D cinema multiple times having my tonight's experience.This one is best STAR WARS original tradition movie and this really impresses me, thought such thing would never come back on business regards, money makes the world go round, it seems Disney found a way to combine both, 1 billion gross box office 'til today (boxofficemojo.com) let me hope this tradition will become popular.Best, not less, not moreBest regardsRalf"

He reminded me of my pup the day after I took him to the vet for 'his little procedure'...Wanted to love it - it was outside the big episode structured thing - a chance to do something fresh and interesting. Sadly this wasn't it...Maybe Star Wars is just too big and too old...the last dinosaur struggling in a tar pit?"

The writers do an absolutely miserable job of making you want to like the characters - the ""good guy"" opens the film in possibly the worst way for a ""hero"" character to be introduced, scoundrel stereotype or not - and the main female character exhibits literally zero character growth throughout the entire story outside of ""I had it rough as a kid"". Finally, I hope you're ready for some bad one-liners, and I especially hope you're ready to hear them come from the last character who should ever be delivering one-liners.That said, the eye-candy is gorgeous and it was fantastic fun to watch the final battle, but if this is Rogue Squadron's origin story I'm genuinely afraid to see what comes next."

By keeping his character arcs on an all-time shallow, and avoiding all banter between these bands of rebels, he has systematically removed all chance of any emotion for the viewer as one by one they fight, die, and form alliances. While Star Wars has always been for the boys, it's ridiculous to presume that there would be zero female rebel volunteers, female imperial scientists, or anyone of note here when half the population or more is female. And why Jyn would choose to hug the biggest idiot man of them all at the end is amazing to me when they basically spent most of the film despising each other. Three stars for Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed, who act their socks off. But thumbs down for the blatant waste of an opportunity to add women to the cast, even in the background. Seems pretty sexist. Ya boo for not utilizing the wondrous Forest Whitaker. And yuck to the CGI characters. I was bored out of my mind in general, and was glad when the end credits rolled. What a shame."

" Very Mixed Feelings
",0.0,0.9943,2017-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Now, I'm not an old Star Wars fan. I didn't grow up on the films, and to be honest, I only watched them for the first time a couple of years ago to prep for Episode VII, and never even got around to watching VI all the way through, but I loved them. IV and V were so amazing, and yes, the prequels had problems (a lot of problems), but I understood their place and what they were trying to do. I adored The Force Awakens, and I went into Rogue One (albeit late) with high, high hopes. And then... Well.The first few minutes were stunning, impactful, and I was eagerly waiting to be sucked right into the storyline. And then we saw Jyn. And I just felt myself drifting further and further away from what this movie was trying to make me feel.I didn't care about Cassian, and I cared about Jyn even less. It takes so long for her to show any emotion, any motivation, that by the time that she did... I couldn't connect with it at all. I had no reason to feel anything but a vague shadow of sympathy that she lost so much, but then it was so... distanced. It felt as though it were a story that a friend of a friend told me about this one person that they met once, rather than this person that I'm supposed to empathize with and admire as a hero.That isn't to say that I disliked all of the characters. My heart hurt for Bodhi, and I fell in love with K2 and Chirrut and Baze, and I thought most of the references to the original movies were wonderful, but the fact that I couldn't connect with the two main characters seriously hurt my appreciation of where the film went.The climax, I thought, was wonderful. As soon as the battles picked up, it was a bit overwhelmingly hectic, but that to an extent served a point, showing the chaos of what they were trying to do. I did expect the ending, to a degree, and it have an effect on me... But to me the real saving grace was the last five or so minutes, when the connection to the first films became clear. The way that they tied things together, the line of emotional connection that they managed to pull with the assumption that you know what happens, after the film ends? Wonderful. But it just doesn't make up for everything wrong with the first 2+ hours.Overall, this movie could have been a lot worse. It very nearly was. But it could have been so, so much better, at least in my opinion."

I have understood this is about the prolonged war between the Empire and the Rebellion with lots of fights between spaceships and soldiers on the ground and attacks to Empire bases. The image and action sequences are well succeeded and keep the viewer attentive and interested. This is about a terrible super weapon the Empire has got and that is capable of destroying any planet. The Rebellion is trying to get the weapon plans to be able to turn it inoperative by activating a flaw that was put in it by the scientist who created it and was secretly supporting the Rebellion. Felicity Jones does a great role as the heroin. Well this is a movie that keeps you attentive all the time and that is all.

" A film worth rebelling against
",-0.0516,0.9918,2017-08-14 00:00:00,4,"""Rogue One"" is an American science fiction film from 2016 and actually the highest grossing film of the entire year. The reason is obviously the film's close connection to Star Wars and as the series got new life breathed into it back in 2015 and we get the next film in 2017, this one here was a bit of a filler movie that made sure fans don't have to wait for the next blockbuster for two years. What a long time! And eventually the film was nothing but forgettable filler material. And at easily 2 hours, it really dragged on many occasions. The director here is Gareth Edwards and I am not familiar with the name or works at all I think. The writers are really many and I won't list the names, but it turned out to be an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The film can easily be structured into two halves with the first ending with Mikkelsen's character's death. The first half is certainly superior to the second and because of the latter you could maybe also add war here as a genre. There with Mikkelsen I already mentioned an actor who is one of Europe's very best these days for sure and in my opinion, except the opening scene, he was completely wasted. Same can be said about Forest Whitaker, another very talented guy and the only Oscar winner in the cast here I think. I also think that Smits, Ahmed and Mendelsohn have more range than they were allowed to put on display here.And then we have lead actress Felicity Jones and there is no denying that she is really talented, recently got her first Oscar nomination too. But these kind of movies may not be her thing, maybe she is actually too talented to lead a film like this. She may not have huge star potential, even if she is stunning and that's certainly why people in 10-15 years will talk about Ridley, but not about Jones I am afraid. Her male co-lead Diego Luna may be another actor from this category. Talent yes, star potential not really. There is just no denying that this film is about nothing but the technical aspects, most of all the visual effects of course and the latter is also one of two categories where this film, mostly thanks to its box office success, managed Academy Award nominations. But in my opinion, this is a contender for weakest Academy Award nominee released in 2016, even if the work in the respective fields may be impressive. I can't deny that. But story is just so much more important to me. So yeah as you see, I had quite a few problems with this one. I think that frequently memorable villains/antagonists are more important than memorable heroes really, but the bad guys here are just as forgettable. One of the not too many positive aspects from the film is the ending, which probably let many also forget about the tons of mediocrity in the previous hour. Overall, I cannot share the praise critics and audiences had for this one.I may be a bit biased as sci-fi has always been among my least favorite genres, but I also liked the Star Wars film from the year before a lot more than this one here. By the way, the occasional Star Wars reference here in terms of character inclusions (like Leia in the very last scene) could not save this style-over-substance film either. And it is also not very original anymore to have a robot creature be the only source of comedy here, not even for the franchise. My idea here would have been extend the first 75 minutes story-wise to 100 and include the crucial parts of the rebellious attacks and make this a more focused film. That way I may have liked it more. It's a thumbs-down. Not recommended and it is a good thing that many aspects here (gonna avoid spoilers) indicate that there will be no Rogue 2. I just hope they come up with something better if they need to fill another year before Episode 9."

",0.0,0.9527,2017-08-11 00:00:00,7,"""Rogue One"" functions as a bridge between Episodes III and IV in this ongoing ""Star Wars"" film series, telling the story of the ambitious plot to obtain the plans to the armored space station The Death Star and hopefully find a weakness. A character named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is recruited by The Rebel Alliance because it was her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped to design the damn thing. Even after Jyn learns from a hologram of her father that it does in fact have a weakness (that he deliberately contrived), the RA won't lift a finger to help her. So she goes ""rogue"" with various soldiers, a Rebel spy (Diego Luna), a smart alecky droid (voice of Alan Tudyk), and an Imperial defector (Riz Ahmed).While it is true that the script isn't without flaws, ""Rogue One"" is a spirited enough adventure. We don't really get to know characters that well, but they possess a basic inherent rooting factor that does help. Director Gareth Edwards handles the scope of the material quite well, and this viewer, for one, didn't feel that his pacing was too sluggish. The expected abundance of CGI was actually fairly impressive, for the most part. The action steadily builds towards an ultimately large scale battle in space that is satisfying.Best of all, it's nice to see Darth Vader in full bad ass evil villain mode, even if his screen time is limited. Governor Tarkin is also brought back, using the digitized rendering of the image of the late Peter Cushing, and this effect turns out better than expected, if not perfect. Various nods are made to characters and details from Episode IV, such as those characters who pick a fight with Luke in the cantina.It really does throw you off at first, not hearing that familiar, majestic John Williams theme OR seeing an expository crawl at the beginning. (The score by Michael Giacchino isn't bad at all but it's nowhere near as memorable as anything Williams composed.) Fortunately, once the story kicks in, this becomes a solidly entertaining viewing experience.The performances from the international cast are decent. Tudyk is amusing as a droid who doesn't ACT much like a droid; he has a sardonic, sarcastic personality. Forest Whitaker is over the top as an extremist character who really doesn't serve much of a purpose.All in all, ""Rogue One"" shows the audience a fairly good time, right up until its conclusion designed to lead right into the opening of Episode IV.Seven out of 10."
" Amazing Movie With Great Moments of Humor
",0.875,0.9805,2017-08-10 00:00:00,9,"This is actually my favorite Star Wars movie plot wise. I'm aware that many will disagree, but this film nails everything perfectly. The comical moments did not feel out of place, and the character development was spot on. Not only does it set up episodes 4, 5, and 6 well it also gives you a heroic story of triumph and loss.This is a great film for Star Wars buffs, film fans, or just those who like a good action flick.Real Score: 8.9/10"
" A True Star Wars Film
",-0.2023,0.9928,2017-08-09 00:00:00,10,"I was so grateful for the release of Rogue One after the disappointment of Ep7 The Force Awakens. The latter currently scoring just slightly higher than Rogue One on IMDb (at 8.1). Sure Ep7 serves a purpose and clearly satisfies it's contemporary demographic. But it's one that I do not associate with, myself being a massive fan of the original trilogy from back in the day. Rogue One really understands the Star Wars ethos and plays out all the beats of the originals, staying true to the lore with integrity and originality. You know watching Rogue One that the director is a fan and is 100 percent invested, making it all the more easy for the viewer to invest also. And that I did.The real highlight of this movie is the return of Darth Vader, who's ominous presence is felt throughout and as the tension reaches it's climactic crescendo he gives us a moment of such awe and dread it's right up there amongst his most iconic scenes. With all the superficial remakes and expanded universe franchises being churned out today. Rogue One took us back to that familiar world of A New Hope, where the sense of peril and wonderment is back to it's visceral best. Kudos to Gareth Edwards for this standalone movie. It is so well crafted, brilliantly acted and tidily scripted. But more importantly it truly is the love letter all Star Wars fans have been longing for. 10/10"
" Not dark enough, too PC
",0.0,0.7988,2017-08-07 00:00:00,4,"Wanted to like it, but the political diversity agenda made me cringe too much. ""Yes, girls can do it too"" is the sledgehammer approach to casting. Yes we know they can do it too, stop forcing that message down our throats.No longer is casting a merit-based recruitment, but more about the minority group you identify with.Fully expecting the next Star Wars to have trans-gender Jedis taking the lead. Not because it makes a good story, but because it ticks politically correct boxes.After all these years of watching Star Wars, I now want the dark side to win. We need the good guys to get smashed, it's time to take things off-road. After all, the world we live in is quite a dark place these days what with faith-based terrorism, capitalist greed, environmental devastation. We need to show the true potential of the dark side rather than squashing it under ""good deeds from diversity approved roles"".Darth Vader did not appear scary or menacing. Just seemed like some actor in a suit. I actually did like the robot, K2S0 - that was the only thing I liked, and when the Death Start unleashed its weapon. Everything else was tame."

It was also magnificent to have the connection between the first trilogy which started in 1977, and the second trilogy which started in 1999, and all the questions we sought. There was not a performance that was very prominent, but it was all good. Another issue that I appreciate is that I remain faithful to the details of the fictional characters typologies.

" Rating: B+
",0.0,0.9996,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, I love the original trilogy, I mostly hate the prequels and last year's film was my number one pick for the best movie of 2015, so this is the movie I was definitely waiting desperately for since the start of 2016 ... And it did great!I'll start with my issues with this film because there are some major problems that need to be discussed. The one that's bothering me the most is the lack of emotional attachment that I had with the characters. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the protagonist and the only character with a backstory supporting her, so I did care about her and I always wanted her to be on the screen. The same can't be said for the others!Captain Andor (Diego Luna) only gets a few seconds to express his feelings from his past, Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen) have a beautiful and super funny friendship, but I never got a single scene that explained why they were like that and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) is the usual audience's favorite character due to his one liners and super funny scenes. However, when the character that you cared the most, besides the main one, of course, is a robot ... Something's not right. The emotional ending the director tried to achieve didn't quite have the desired effect.Governor Tarkin appears a lot in this film and, if you don't know, he was also a major character in the previous films of this franchise. The actor who portrayed him at the time was Peter Cushing (died in 1994) and here comes the issue: he portrayed him again. His CGI face is amazing, almost perfect like CGI is in the rest of the movie, but it's still a manipulated face and I can totally see it. I could never get used to it and I doubt that anyone can, it's too obvious and it takes away all the focus of his scenes. I'm not saying ""it's a lack of respect"" like some critics' opinions, I actually think it was a great idea, but it should have been more subtle (like they perfectly did in the first scene he was in, with a mirror reflection).Since I'm in the dark side now, I should talk about Darth Vader. Hum, this one's hard to discuss. The Star Wars fan in me wanted one of the biggest villains ever to show up constantly and kill a whole bunch of Rebels, but the critic in me knows that it's not something I should've expected since I knew that he wouldn't have a big part. With this in mind, I find myself in between something that is a problem with the movie and something that is a problem for me. Director Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is the main villain of the film and he's as good as I could wish for, as well as the actor who did a great job. However, I did feel a little bit disappointed with so little Vader. He has an AWESOME scene near the end that totally gave me goosebumps and it's the scene that I'll watch time and time again, but I wanted more from him.The first act doesn't flow really well since there needs to be an introduction to all the characters and to all the places they are, which slows down the pacing. Jumping from place to place usually doesn't work, but it didn't last that long.Don't worry, I really enjoyed this film and I think it's a great one! The visual effects are the best I've seen in the whole franchise, with action sequences unbelievably awesome. The space battle is as entertaining as one can imagine and the CGI incorporated in the film is near perfection.I loved how they made this movie different from the others. The score is slightly different (great job, Michael Giacchino), the tone is also different: it's a time of war, the Stormtroopers are not as white- clean as before, not all of the Rebels are ""good"" and there are a lot of people injured from the battles and constant attacks on the cities. After the first act, the pacing picks up and I'm in a fast, entertaining movie with great performances and characters.It's true that I didn't care that much about the characters by the end, but they're still entertaining. K-2So is super funny and I liked him very much, the friendship between Baze and Chirrut is compelling and funny as well, Andor and Jyn have the most serious parts and they're interesting and charming. All of the performances are good with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna having really great moments. Krennic is a good villain and Vader is awesome in every scene he's in (which are not that many).My main praise for this anthology film is something that I can't really explain, but Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope just got its decade- long complaint solved in the most amazing way possible. So many memes and gags around this one thing just got completely deleted from history ... Thank you! This is a movie that stands on its one, it can't really be compared with the others since it's so unique and I can't express myself through words how pleased I am with Gareth Edwards' work. Great job directing this film, amazing action scenes, either with ground combat and space battles, and a breathtaking last act.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is an action-packed film, with amazing visuals, great humor and funny characters. It does have some problems, it's not perfect, but it's not a bad movie at all. With my major issue being the lack of character's depth, this movie actually gives an entertaining two-hour runtime and a great time at the theater.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" A rebellion well worth saving
",0.3612,0.9995,2017-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.The latest 'Star Wars' entry, which is somewhat of a prequel, 'Rogue One' is a worthy prequel but seems to be intended as a standalone chapter and it actually fares even better in this regard. 'Rogue One' is not as good as the original trilogy, not being as much as a genre landmark or as influential but is certainly better than any of the prequel trilogy films combined and along with 'The Force Awakens' one of the better 'Star Wars' films since 'The Return of the Jedi'. With this being said, 'Rogue One' is going to be reviewed as if considered a standalone chapter.'Rogue One' has so many good things, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4/10 at least. For one thing, the production values (with a couple of exceptions) are amazing. Particularly good are the special effects, which are not only of outstanding and astonishingly real quality but actually drive and enhance the story and helps provide some great visual story-telling. It's wonderfully shot too, the cinematography being some of the most memorable and beautifully composed and transitioned of the year. 'Rogue One' similarly boasts a rousing, sometimes dream-like and atmospheric score from the always dependable Michael Giacchino, one misses John Williams of course and having a different composer takes some getting used to for someone who grew up with Williams' iconic themes, but Giacchino is a worthy replacement.Also impressive is a script that treats its audience with respect, rather than talking down, being bland and soulless or so dumbed down that it lacks brains. Tension, humour, action and pathos are beautifully balanced, the references and nod a delight for any 'Star Wars' fan and written in a way that is affectionate rather than shoe-horned. The story never felt dull (to me), maintaining a snappy pace and with a lot of heart and tension. There is a great combination of what made the original trilogy so great, something that Gareth Edwards fully understood, while having its own identity, this is not a re-hash yet there is an affectionate nostalgia reminiscent of the original trilogy's spirit. It makes sense, and is darker, more poignant and richer than the whole saga has been in a long time.Then there is the action, which is thrilling and has a real sense of purpose. The last forty minutes in particular are thrillingly epic. Nice to see footage of Peter Cushing and even more wonderful was seeing one of cinema's most iconic villains Darth Vader making an appearance magnificently voiced as ever by James Earl Jones.Mainly the cast are strong, with a feisty and likable heroine in Felicity Jones' Jyn, terrific support from Diego Luna and especially Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn's sterlingly played villain. The best characters are K-2SO, the wisecracking robot played with terrific comic timing and gusto by Alan Tudyk, and Chirrut, beautifully realised and 'Rogue One's' most interesting character characterised splendidly by Donnie Yen.Not without its faults by all means. Some characters are underused and underdeveloped, a few like Forrest Whittaker's (pretty wasted) Gerrera being pointless. Some of the pacing is jumpy and rushed which comes at the expense of making a cast of perhaps too many characters more consistently interesting.Design and CGI for Tarkin is ropey and distractingly artificial. While it was nice to see younger Leia again, it was cheaply recreated and like Tarkin sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the visuals, which were otherwise amazing as said.Overall, worthy prequel and a very good standalone chapter. A rebellion well worth saving. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" I was bored
",-0.2732,0.5332,2017-08-01 00:00:00,1,"Simply put there Is no character development.Character development is essential, especially in a movie of this nature. Caring about the characters is what gives action scenes their tension, and I didn't care. So as you can imagine I was bored, plus there are many plot holes and pointless scenes just to throw action in, which you notice a lot more when you don't care.In the originals, We have funny characters with CHEMISTRY. Han solo is the charming rogue (no dumb pun intended), Leia is the sassy princess, and Luke is our weak hero that grows stronger as the series continues. The action is based around intense dialogue and characters we grow to love and care about. The effects were limited but the characters carry the film like they should. The lightsaber battles may have been a bit rubbish but we were still invested in the stakes we were given.Rogue one on the other hand is all about effects and visuals. Sure it looks pretty but its bland and boring because there is nothing to invest us in the action. And there is quite an obvious ending that everyone will know.This film doesn't deserve the popularity and is more evidence that if you slap a star wars sticker on something, people will lap it up regardless"

You just need time, I get it.OK, so I'm no big Star Wars fan. But I did enjoy The Force Awakens. And as this is a huge movie with a big budget, big stuff, I was positive. I'm almost always positive when it comes to movies. And with all the stuff that is Star Wars, it kind of has to be at least pretty good, right? Well I thought so, but wrong. This movie commits the greatest sin a movie can: it's boring. It's just downright boring and dull. The main characters, the guy and the girl, have no chemistry, super dull and not even charming in the slightest. Especially the guy, he's like anti-charming. To spare you the boring details, let me just say this, it was two characters I liked, one of them is Donnie Yen. But guess what, he criminally underused! He has like one fight scene, and that's it. He is such a cool character, what a damn shame. The other character I liked is that new robot. He's entertaining.But yeah, this movie is just boring. Sure, for the ultra fans I guess there's a bunch of easter-eggs and connections, but for me, it was just dull. Even the huge action scenes really fail to entertain.Alright alright alright, yes, there is a scene with a VERY famous character, and yes it's awesome. But every scene should be at least a little like that one. You can't have ONE awesome scene in a movie. I also liked the CGI-dude.

" Star Wars at its best
",0.1531,0.9861,2017-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Very few spoilers..When I first saw the initial trailers for Rogue One I wasn't looking forward to the movie release but this is a great film, arguably the best Star Wars film ever made. I'm a mad Star Wars fan, love them all (maybe the Jar Jar one not so much) I saw this 4 times at the cinema in the first week of release It is superbly directed and acted with believable characters and a great link to ""A New Hope"". I think its very important that characters are believable in who they are playing (If you've seen Alien Covenant, try telling me any of the crew were believable, did the bumbling captain look like a leader lol) Rogue One is quite a dark film with characters being killed off almost as quick as they are introduced but it moves at a great pace, and it pulls it off as it is very well cast, hats off again to the casting crew, I thought Forest Whitaker was excellent as Saw, the whole cast were, especially Jyn, Cassian, Galen, Krennic and Chirrut & Baze and of course the droid K-2SO, for me the biggest surprise, how could they ever eclipse C3PO and R2D2, well they have. As most of the cast don't appear in a New Hope I'm very surprised by any criticism of how quickly they are killed off. Visually the film is stunning with great locations, if I was a storm trooper, I would want to be stationed on Scariff. The Death Star looks super menacing as it comes into view, I'm not sure given its size it would cause an eclipse but it makes it look twice as menacing. This film is what Star Wars fans have been crying out for, a darker version, with stunning locations and great fighting sequences on land and in space (If you are not keen on some of the CGI of Tarkin And Leigh...its nit-picking) The final scene when it switches from Jyn & Cassian on Scariff to Vaders ships as the Rebels try to jump back into hyperspace is incredible and ties the film superbly to ""A New Hope"""

Not a true Star Wars fan, I watched this movie just because it's available and have nothing else to watch. I've heard about Rogue One and thought to myself, ""Oh great. Another prequel??!?! You've got to be kidding me."" Well to my surprise, this prequel drew me in a lot more than all the other prequels did. It concludes right up to Star Wars: A New Hope, just to give you an idea of the timeline of this film. There are surprises in this movie that I did not expect. Familiar faces all across the board, it goes into the suspense of another group of resistance fighters in trying to defeat the Imperial Alliance.There are a few surprise characters that I was very happy to see and completed the whole Star Wars experience for me. It made me want to watch ""A New Hope"" all over again. That's how good it is.The beginning was a little rough because there were quite a few locations and characters involved. I got a little confused at first, but it all came together towards the latter half of the movie. It was an emotional movie for me and especially at the very end. Some of the action sequences and acting were top notch. Again, it left me pumping my arm up and down to go with a loud grunt. There were proud moments when I wish I can just go outside and yell my head off to release some energy. Yeah, it got me that into the movie. That's how you know it's a good movie. If you are moved by it.All in all, a somewhat typical Star Wars type drama. Just another prequel that adds more detail to the whole Star Wars saga and how things came to be. If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a must see. As for how the movie ends, wonderfully done! I can't explain the wave of emotions that hit me in the face when I saw who made an appearance.

" I was pleasantly surprised with Rogue One
",0.6124,0.409,2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"I found it significantly more entertaining than The Force Awakens, and one of the best of the series. I can't put my finger on exactly why I found it so much fun. I saw most of the others in theaters, but this one only on my computer screen (Netflix), so it wasn't the immersion factor.I generally dislike the whole Small, Beautiful Amazon Who Can Beat Up Lots Of Big Strong Males trope that seems to be filling our screens lately. The not-quite-yet-ready CGI tech on the dead actors' character faces was annoying. The ending was a bit too predictable for my tastes (although I guess I should have known going in ....). And of course the whole ""The FORCE"" nonsense is annoying throughout the series.Also, a bit of rank cowardice somewhere in it might have spiced it up some, setting a contrast to the unrelenting self-sacrifice.Still, I liked it. A lot. It's a well done story of 'ordinary' people taking on what they know are nearly impossible odds against a great evil."

She is a cute face and that's all. Forest Whitaker gave something worse than his performance in Battlefield Earth. All the characters act like patients in the psych ward, they're too cartoonish. It's like they spent too much time with Angelina Jolie.I object to them using Grand Boff Tarkin's likeness in digital form. After about 10 seconds on screen, you can tell it is digitized. They put Carrie Fisher in it digitally and I think this is something they should stop doing! Seriously. A crappy end to a crappy movie. Oh in case you don't know, this movie ends exactly where A New Hope begins. Let's face it, like Terminator franchise, there are some sci-fi movies where, you must leave much to the imagination, because exploring a back story ruins everything. This is another such franchise that should have been left alone."
" Unnecessary but entertaining
",0.5927,0.8316,2017-07-21 00:00:00,6,I guess you would call this an insertaquel as it is inserted between episode 3 and 4 and fills in a couple gaps leading to the very first movie released. There are certainly some characters from previous movies throughout this one. It does take 2 hours of your time to fill in the background on how the information for attacking the death star came about. That could have been accomplished in about 10 minutes. There were some good battles with good graphics and they sure were better shots than any of the other movies. I think the biggest benefit will come in marketing new toys of the new spacecraft that appear in this movie
" Some errors, yes, but a Star Wars unlike any other before it
",-0.6956,0.4795,2017-07-21 00:00:00,9,"I've seen this movie several times, in the theater and at home. This review is mostly to set expectations, and counter the complaints. The idea of the movie is 'Ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things'. This movie is about heroism, at all costs. The Star Wars bar is so high it's unrealistic, I think each episode appeals in their own way. Yes, they sometimes fall flat but I disagree with others who feel this one did, I thought it was profound. People have a 'Han Solo'/Vader / Luke Skywalker expectations for character development. I want to to stress that strong character development wasn't necessary for Rogue One. I LOVED this aspect, a 'stand alone' story with finality. We're so used to flashbacks in movies now; revisiting dead characters so often the expectation is now a cliché. Rogue One had plenty of tie ins and FINALLY explained the reason Luke was able to blow up a massive Death Star with one shot (A joke that's festered for 40 years). The end of the movie AND the lead characters (literally) left me amazed and applauding the choice the creators made. After seeing the movie again, the realization that completing the mission involves their own demise is presented early and without ambiguity. The acceptance of this is fully acknowledged in the last scene. Their demeanor wasn't of shock at all, and their embrace was the mark sealing their known fate. These quickly forgotten characters set the direction for the entire Star Wars story line, it's an homage to the ''little guy, if it weren't for their sacrifices, this wouldn't have been possible''The only thing that really bothered me was all the damn levers, it seems like nothing major happens unless a lever is pulled... watch it again and it will make you laugh. - thanks for your time."

I was worried Rogue One was going to go the route of Suicide Squad because of the reshoots. After watching Rogue One with a friend and my mother last year, the movie is one of my favorites beside the Original Trilogy and The Force Awakens.The main thing I like about Rogue One is it does an amazing job explaining how no one in the Empire knew about the weakness in the original Death Star that was exploited by Luke in Episode IV-A New Hope. It's also great in leading up to A New Hope. Also, Rogue One shows the Rebel Alliance in a different light. It shows that the Rebels are willing to do some dark things like killing people. I found that to be very interesting.Rogue One isn't without its flaws. One of those flaws is some characters don't have their backstories fully fleshed out. We get a bit more info about Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor than the others. The other members of the Rogue One team are just there for the ride. The movie's main villain, Orson Krennic, and K2-SO were the stand-out characters in Rogue One. It was awesome that James Earl Jones returned as Darth Vader. His appearance in Rogue One was a highlight for me. I had issues with certain characters appearing in the movie because of really obvious CGI. It was very distracting when those characters appeared.The movie's score was another flaw for me. I loved Michael Giacchino's previous works on movies and shows like The Incredibles, Doctor Strange, and Fringe. His work on Rogue One had to be done in three weeks because the previous conductor, Alexandre Desplat, because of reshoots and he was unavailable. It's obvious that the music was rushed because of that.Despite those flaws, I really enjoyed Rogue One. It added much needed information and background to the Star Wars Universe. The movie had a great cast. Also, Rogue One is way better than The Force Awakens. Definitely worth adding to my movie collection to watch over and over again. It's also worth a watch for any Star Wars and sci-fi fans."
" If you know Starwars watch this film
",0.0,-0.9252,2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"To me star wars has always been a space opera, and although CGI had to ruin the mix, it still felt like one in this film. Grand admiral and Leia seem really large, their features seem like the camera creates an up-close image and doesn't trick anyone. The plot is worth watching to understanding star wars. Rogue one, not to be confused with rogue squadron, is a rebel band of misfits whom create an alliance with the rebellion. The misfits have set against the rebel empire and call themselves rogue one as they enter the force field. They have an imperial cargo pilot, whom so dashingly escapes the unavoidable to retrieve the Deathstar plans from the planet Sariff, i mean Scarif. My guess is the empire really is stupid. If not for the CGI, and if this movie were made in the 80s, in tradition of star wars, it would have worked well. The bots and planets actually are convincing, where we conclude there are times to use CGI and not to use CGI. The ships not so much. Yet space opera is very much so British scifi space opera here. No plot holes here, death star doesn't need a force-field. The empire must have thought it was invincible. Some of the American acting however, I can not swallow. For instance, Forest Steven Whitaker is good, but his part was too short and overplayed. Yes, star wars fans, the death star does have a slow class 4 hyperdrive. I rec this movie, if you are a fan of star wars, and not Disney in general. I can't say this is bad, actually the props are well done and something tells me this is an 80s TV series or movie and it screams starwars novel or comicbook as well. However the cgi looks pasted on and the fact that its the British side of star wars may throw the continuity out the window. Is obi wan kenobi a British hermit, last of his race, or part of some race on the other side of the galaxy. i can't say its a starwars movie, but a starwars extension or prelude to the movie. Its good for one watch, but just one."

Considering that pretty much all of the main cast in this movie is killed I am not surprised that they didn't go into to much depth. However if the creators of the movie don't care about the characters, why should I as a viewer care about them? The story wasn't very exciting neither. It's just about how they get the plans of the death star. There aren't even any surprises in the story. Some of the effects looked horrifying and I am not talking about the Darth Vader scene. His scene is actually the only thing that was memorable about the movie but not enough to safe this flick for me.Wasted opportunity..."

With all of that said, this is one the worst movies I have ever seen about anything. This film doesn't do anything to me. I was sitting there knowing I am being manipulated out of my cash. If I was to doubt that the original Star Wars ever happened, this movie would make me a non-believer of the series. This prequel/sequel is predictable, badly shot, has one of the worst scripts and the pacing looked more like a holiday camp than work camp from space. Through out the whole picture there is not one moment of believability. You want to see huge spacecraft bump each other to nudge movement? This is it!

However, I remember the big preview for Rogue One peaked my interest so I decided to finally give a new one a chance. At this point, I don't really see how movies like this can be ""original "" since I've seen so many of the same stories done before between ""father-daughter or father- son"" beginnings and as the basis for films. Sure, some things were different in minor ways, but generally that's very familiar at the beginning, so I was like, ""I've seen this all before a thousand times"".However, it is a well made movie. Even as someone who hasn't followed the franchise in 25 or more years, I really liked the visuals, score, and the action scenes were good. It was a bit ""uneven"" throughout in quality, but it did reach enough good moments. The end was great.Still, without being an avid fan and follower, I don't see how I can call this a great film. If I was a fan, maybe I could, but I can say that it is a good film and it was fun to break the ice and catch up after all these years having missed the new ones. I'll be watching in the Force Awakens, which has higher ratings on most review sites, next. 8/10"
" Trite and predictable
",-0.2023,0.9109,2017-07-14 00:00:00,4,"I'd seen the trailer and thought it would be worth watching. Well, it wasn't. The plot is pretty much of a rehash of A New Hope and contains very few original ideas. As has been said, the characters are pretty bland, have no background and nothing to draw the interest. The Jyn character is either tearing up over her father or demonstrating that only her suffering and loss matters. When the Cassian character tries to explain that they have all suffered loses, she stamps her little foot and refuses to accept he has a point. And then later, the scene that really made me want to shoot the TV is the one where the leaders of the rebel alliance are all gathered together to decide what to do next, Jyn starts on a 'rousing' and 'inspiring' monologue that ends with the alliance leaders all going ""Gosh! She's right!"". So all these rebel leaders who have been fighting for years are put to shame by some know nothing humanette. Such a clunky way of making her seem like a redeemer, a leader. From whiny brat to whiny inspiration. The character is obviously aimed at pubescent girls who can easily identify with her. The Rey character in The Force Awakens was a much better drawn and believable female lead plus she didn't go into pout mode every five minutes I have a confession, after that scene I called it a night. I just could not take any more. I watched The Force Awakens and it was like a breath of fresh air after this stinker."

" Mediocre and disrespectful of the original franchise
",0.3182,-0.9831,2017-07-08 00:00:00,4,"The main character is unlikable and almost irrelevant. Without about 15 other people she would have achieved nothing. She has no powers, no character, nothing to make her stand out as the hero. I did not expect a new Luke here, but she has nothing at all.The movie is way to long and packed full with CGI, battle action and all sorts of unnecessary or comedy relief dialogue. The movie had undertones of conflicts of our current time - often you can imagine watching a movie taking place in Afghanistan or some Arab states. Bad idea to bring in these aspects of conflicts that can not be reduced to ""we good -you evil"".The story is plain and full of logical problems. It's all ""just because"" - the core of it is a problem from the original movies: why build a super-weapon that has a total failure trigger built in that is quite easily accessible? They made an over 2h movie to just explain that - and failed, as the explanation is as weak as none at all.In their wake of destruction producers ignored just so many things about the Star Wars universe that you can't count them.The magic is long gone."

After the very disappointed Star Wars 7, Rogue one is offering a new story, which really stands up. We can feel the respect for the movies that were already made in the same universe, which is a relief if you are a fan, like me. The viewer's attention is total from beginning to the end of the movie. What I really enjoyed was the way the characters were presented, one by one, and their strong relationships. For once, I had the pleasant impression that the story was at the heart of the movie, and the characters were here to stand for a cause and not to make a presence and discuss about their lives. There was this very inspiring movement of solidarity and pure friendship between them. People fighting for what's right, and nothing else. I could mention the fact that Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor don't kiss at any point, how surprising? I mean nowadays big firms from the cinema industry, as Walt Disney and Lucasfilm, are making blockbusters movies based on the same weft: violence and love affairs. It really means the world to me that the characters from the movie have been all spared from useless visual and physical feelings, in a way the emotions become even more intense. The viewer is frustrated, he would like them to kiss, but there's not need to show it as we feel it. Not to forget that special effects are breath taking. We're witnessing beautiful landscapes and very realistic explosions. As if it wasn't enough, the presence of some well know characters form the Stars Wars saga, recreated thanks to CGI and old footage, is so well done that I almost missed it (I'm thinking mostly about princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin)Even if I wanted to, I couldn't find any negative facts about this movie.

" Easily the worst film of the Star Wars franchise.
",-0.743,-0.9883,2017-06-25 00:00:00,5,"So the prequels are starting to look pretty amazing compared to the two most recent ""Star Wars"" films. The Force Awakens was a terrible remake that wasn't even supposed to be a remake and this film is some sort of off-shoot that was just terribly done from start to finish. Let's start with the casting. The Jyn Erso girl was annoying and had nothing redeeming or interesting about her. Not sure if that one is on the writing or acting but the character is very bland. Forest Whitaker tried way to hard with his character and he ended up just sounding like someone doing a bad impression of Bane from Batman. Diego Luna was out of place the entire movie. I think he thought he was on set of Zorro instead of a Star Wars film. The CGI characters were disgusting. I've never seen such terrible work in a big-budget film. Tarkin looked like a guy from a PS2 game and Leia looked like a light bulb. If they so badly wanted those characters in this movie, they should have just cast some look-alikes and that would've looked much better and not taken away so much from the film. You couldn't pay attention to the movie when either Tarkin or Leia was on screen because they were so distracting with their awkward CGI. I do not understand how when screening the film before release someone didn't tell the director/producers that Tarkin and Leia were laughable and they look awful. The script was clumsy and cluttered, and the names of things were even worse. Bor Gullet? Seriously? At least Lucas came up with legitimate sounding names and didn't just use words from a human anatomy book. K2-SO was alright but his attempt to be different from past droids was all too obvious. Yes, this wasn't supposed to feel like a part of the seven episodes and was supposed to be darker, but it achieved those in a very bad way that just made for a bad movie. Nice idea, but terribly executed."
" Better than The Force Awakens, at least
",0.4404,0.9843,2017-06-25 00:00:00,6,"As a STAR WARS movie, ROGUE ONE is another mixed-bag affair, thankfully better than the last in the series (THE FORCE AWAKENS) but not exactly what I could term 'great'. I don't think that the overrated Gareth Edwards makes a very good job of the direction, relying on cliché too much (the good guys hitting everything that moves, the bad guys constantly missing) and doing the stupid inter-cutting of fight scenes that result in headaches and a lack of flow. He certainly showed promise with his debut feature MONSTERS, but both this and GODZILLA have been more than a little disappointing.Unlike THE FORCE AWAKENS, ROGUE ONE is a stand-alone prequel that sets up the events of A NEW HOPE. The bits that tie in to A NEW HOPE are done pretty decently, and I liked the appearance of Dareth Vader (great to have James Earl Jones back once more), a young Princess Leia, and a CGI Peter Cushing, who all add to the flow (a shame Cushing's voice was wrong, though). As for the new cast members, the leads (Diego Luna and Felicity Jones) are bland but the supporting members are better, particularly Alan Tudyk's sarcastic robot and Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen as an ass-kicking tag team of Jedi fighters.The first hour and a half of this film are slow and stately and more than a little boring, with long stretches of setting up where little happens. The CGI is okay but too much of it looks like CGI. Thankfully, things build to a great beach assault battle sequence at the climax, which is very well achieved and brings some fun and excitement back to the franchise; it's the best scene in a STAR WARS film since RETURN OF THE JEDI."

Jyn hides in a cave waiting for Saw Gerrera, he then takes care of her until she was sixteen years old. Then she was a prisoner of the empire for whatever reason, she gets rescued by the rebels because they wanted her help because her dad built the blueprint for the deathstar.

Movie was also a shameful attempt for Disney to turn this into a political campaign, seemingly vindicating the war with insurgents in Iraq, in my opinion. This will do nothing but promote more people to become radical religious idiots, fighting against the ""american superpower"" which they correlate with the Federation.

It gives meaning to the ""Star Wars"" throw away line that the plans were not easy to obtain.This movie is about those plans and the effort it took to steal them.There are two major flaws with ""Star Wars"". Storm troupers couldn't shoot and how could such a giant flaw could exist in the Death Star. This film addresses the later and does so very well.Because it does it so well, this movie makes ""Star Wars"" a better film. Virtually every other Star Wars movie after ""Empire"" detracts from the legacy, this does not, and that's why I like this film so much.One issue, the computer generated characters are underwhelming. I don't blame the directly, he was likely promised something that the special effects wizards couldn't deliver."
" Some people just don't get this movie.
",0.0,-0.9833,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I am a big star wars fan, and this movie is probably my favorite out of all of them (except for Empire). The story fits together very well, although there are some slow spots. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the CGI faces on Tarkin and Leia, but when you think about it, it is relatively new technology that they have not perfected yet. My favorite part of this movie is Vader's lightsaber scene. It makes me disappointed when I see his next battle with Obi-Wan. People complain about there not being a opening like all of the other Star Wars, but I should remind you, THIS IS NOT THE OTHER STAR WARS. This is called Rogue One: a Star Wars Story, not Star Wars Episode 3.9, so of course it will be different. Anyways, besides the kinks I mentioned, I think Rogue One is a great movie everybody should see."

",-0.7579,0.7471,2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Without going into details, this was a refreshing and enjoyable departure from the main Star Wars films. It plays more like a war movie (think The Dirty Dozen, the Guns of Navarone, A Bridge too Far or even The Magnificent 7) than a sci-fi genre movie, especially when compared to the rest of the series. Characters have flaws, things go wrong and no one is truly a hero for most of the film. If you are looking for a fun, well-made action movie with human characters (even the nonhuman ones) placed in a science fiction setting, this is the movie for you.

" No good characters means little emotional investment
",0.2516,-0.976,2017-05-18 00:00:00,6,"While some might claim a movie about the theft of the Death Star plans is pointless, it need not be if we can get involved with the characters. Rouge One (2016) was a nice enough theater experience, but I am shocked by just how bland the cast is, particularly Jyn.There is no reason why Jyn should be such a dull character. This is a young woman who shuns political activism because of what it cost her family, who feels abandoned and bitter. Her journey from passive to active rebel should have been moving, but it isn't. What is she like outside of the line of duty? I have no idea! It's much the same with the other rebels, who are one dimensional: spiritual monk, cynical gunner, reluctant pilot, the rebel dedicated to the cause. We don't know much about anyone's past in a movie where the past seems to hang heavy over our heroes and gives them additional emotional fuel to fight the Empire; they don't have any inter-team chemistry. This lack of a memorable cast really dragged the movie down and I admit I was bored for the whole first half. When the characters met their tragic ends, I cared little. This movie was a wasted opportunity and it makes me skeptical about the SW spin-offs to come."
" Disney does it again
",0.0,-0.9798,2017-05-16 00:00:00,3,"Stupified characters with nonsensical motivations that can't be ignored no matter how hard you wish to neglect them. For example, why does Gaylen confess when the Empire is about the kill the engineers, kill the very men who non-conflicting assembled the Death Star for the destruction of innocents? He should have enjoyed seeing the Empire destruct their personnel, as he so masterfully played his hand to stifle and destroy their intentions. And, additionally, he designed a critical flaw in the Death Star to explode and destroy the hundreds of thousands of people on-board, to begin with; what would he care if a few engineers died? Why does he feel guilty about the death of what are essentially sci-fi Nazis? Because Disney wants to impose its simplistic and dumb morality for a 'family friendly' b-rated, blockbuster that has little grounding in reality and is such a contrived and overacted, unfounded piece of garbage that it holds little integrity on its own. Just give me a job writing scripts, I'll give you a better narrative and more character integrity than this hack-job catastrophe."

" Rogue One: (A Semblance of) A Star Wars Story
",-0.5574,-0.9725,2017-05-13 00:00:00,6,"Right off the bat, I am going to clear up the major issue Rogue One: A Star Wars Story presented for me: despite its claim to fame as the story of a fully-fledged suicide mission, it failed utterly and entirely due to the lack of empathy I felt for the Rogue One crew. Despite the heavy-handed 133 minute running time, this movie devoted such little time and attention to character development that it has sadly forced me to dub it ""a generic echo of something once great"". I was certainly apprehensively excited for this latest installment in the Star Wars universe; however all hopes for an equal to The Force Awakens had fallen flat by around the halfway mark. It meshed well with its predecessors, yet lacking the heart that it so sorely needed, I felt the tons of money poured into visual effects were wasted. Considering the effort, both financial and physical, as is always the case, it definitely fell short.First off, I'd like to talk about characters. Not only are they integral to every story, but they are especially integral to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The rebellion is built on hope, and the film is built on its characters. My pre-sentiments of the movie, gathered from spoilers and marketing, left little to imagination as to the pain and sorrow which surely must swamp its viewers by the final, heartbreaking scenes, detailing the brutal fates of our dearly beloved cast. Yet, surprisingly, not only did the supposedly tragic end disappoint me – it bored me. I read someone's thought someplace that the movie did not rush through its plot – yet I would argue it rushed so much that by the end I felt no connection with the characters! Somewhere else, I read another person's view: ""All the characters were introduced very quickly all in one movie and yet by the end I still loved them enough and felt the significance of their sacrifice enough to cry a bit."" I wish it had been so, but I sympathize with the first eleven words more than the remainder. It was only too brief. Having seen the film, I barely know any of the characters' names, and why? Because they lacked matured, developed personalities. And so they meant nothing, when they should have meant everything. I should add that I generally disagreed with the cast choice; however, that is my personal preference.Related to the subject of characters is plot. I find its lack of soul disturbing. I can't personally fathom how many decades of inaccurate storm troopers, smouldering Death Stars and falsely christened nostalgia moments humanity can or will stand – I, for one, am tiring of rehashed synopses. As is wont to happen in real life, people never tire of returning to historical events from all number of viewpoints, and that is essentially what this film does. However, I consider the plot to either lack sufficient material or utilise what it has poorly. The film felt generic, non- engaging and dry. I would suggest that Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manifests Disney's true nature – an avaricious company concerned not with producing original, momentous pictures, but rather with mass- producing template-made blockbusters that draw on cheap emotions in place of deeply rooted tales of virtue and vice.A great lesson I wish movie-goers would learn: Visual effects, however expensive and impressive, never guarantee a movie's success. This is also true for Rogue One. Surely a large portion of the budget was expended on spaceships crashing into one another, and while that is all nice and well, I consider such efforts wasted and vain in contrast with the film on a whole. Peter Cushing's digital resurrection was a lovely piece of artistry, to be sure – victorious to the degree of convincing unsuspecting viewers of its authenticity – and sometimes the movie- makers use their incredible capabilities for better purpose, such as when they animate the droid K-2SO.Finally, morals are dangerously dubious. Obviously nothing explicit or obscene is shown throughout the duration of the film, yet disturbingly (and irritatingly) enough, the ""spreading of the Force"" goes on. I am always relieved when these erroneous religious principles are kept to a bare minimum, yet this story is replete with a conversion to the religiously dualistic belief in the Force, utilitarianism in Cassian's ""pragmatic"" murder of his friend, and general selfishness on the part of every character. These are subtle, yet mind-altering details.Altogether, I give Rogue One: A Star Wars Story six stars for good production, a decent if forgettable score, effects and a clever touch of comedy. If I were feeling harsher, I could rate it lower, but I hardly have the heart. Flawed morality, token characters (especially Vader), something trying hard to be nostalgia, and a soulless watch in its entirety see the removal of four stars. I think people need to realise that classics cannot be re-lived in our modern day and age, but rather we need to be forward-thinking, creating original content appropriate for our place in history. I appreciate the ""war"" element, but largely we are seeing nothing new in this film. Slipping, the Star Wars franchise is."

" Excellent - Finally the script writers are back
",0.5719,-0.8475,2017-05-12 00:00:00,8,When the Force Awakens came out I was sorely disappointed. Sufficient to state that my last review summarised it as a poor remake of Episode IV.This is a great offshoot from the original script. Equally it is now clear why Disney opted to purchase this franchise at what was an incredible amount of money - there is ample scope for so many different story lines.SPOILERS!! For all those that recall the original Star Wars there is a moment of sadness when a lady declares that many lives have lost in the pursuit of the Death Star plans - enough said - the rest you need to watch
" Finally, a Star Wars prequel worth of the name
",-0.4019,0.9958,2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"So I grew up with Star Wars. I was a kid when the original came out, and I loved it from the start. And each following movie was great in their own way, concluding with Return of the Jedi. The movies had the ""magic"" for lack of a better word; they had the right blend of likable characters, compelling stories, drama, and humor that make a movie great.And then came the prequels...The Star Wars prequels are basically proof that Lucas forgot how to tell his own story. Instead of using dazzling effects to help tell a story, he wrote a story that would showcase his effects. Flat characters, a plot line that was an uninspired confusing mess, and truly horrific direction. For many, Star Wars died with the prequels...especially after the beloved originals were edited for the umpteenth time and the theatrical releases basically impossible to get.So when Rogue One came along, I was hesitant. The story was intriguing; always wondered how the Rebels got the plans for the Death Star. And hey, Vader was back, and Tarkin, and that was something I really wanted to see. I was a bit worried about the director; Edwards has talent and tells a visual story really well, but his ""people"" stories are often lacking and can be flat; just watch 2014's Godzilla, and you'll see what I mean. But wow, was I pleasantly surprised at this movie! It has all the things that made Star Wars so great in the first place. The story is simple, yet compelling and above all LOGICAL; none of this bizarre non-sensical plot lines from the prequel trilogy. The story made sense from start to finish, and that was a huge plus. The characters are likable, as well, though you know if you've seen the original that things can't end well for them. The blend of drama and humor is spot on, with the humor largely provided by the voice talents of Alan Tudyk as K2SO, a snarky droid. And as any Star Wars movie has, the effects were eye-popping. And I don't just mean the space battles and such; while excellent (and this is where Edwards can really shine), they were not the most amazing thing about it. No, that goes to the extremely clever way that characters from A New Hope were fit into this film in a seamless way. First you have Tarkin. Played in the original by Peter Cushing, the idea that he would be back bothered many fans; that's a guy you just don't recast. But with advances in computer tech, and using a good actor to play the part, Tarkin was back and bigger than life. He even has a bigger role than in the original, and unless you knew Cushing was dead you'd never know it wasn't him on the screen. It's nearly flawless, how it was done. And other characters were brought back as well; Red and Gold leader from A New Hope were in the film, too, by the simple trick of using unused footage from the original to get them in the story. It really helped make the film ""feel"" like it was happening at the same basic time as the original. The attention to detail was impressive as well. Vader has the same costume as his original; it's not as advanced and ""shiny"" as his outfits from Empire or Jedi. The storm troopers and Rebel fleet troopers have on the same outfits as in A New Hope; indeed, some actually ARE the same costumes, pulled from storage. Everything looks and feels right, and that's a huge plus for the film.And while one iconic part of Star Wars history wasn't involved - John Williams, the man behind the music - Michael Giacchino does a great job of putting his own twist on the classic themes of Star Wars while adding new ones of his own. All in all, this was just a great movie. In many ways, it's not even really a Star Wars movie as much as it is a story like Where Eagles Dare or The Dirty Dozen that takes place in the Star Wars universe. But it's so well crafted and blends the surrounding story elements (from the cartoon series Rebels to the movies themselves) that it fits just fine even if it's not a classic Star Wars kind of story. If you haven't seen it, and you didn't like the prequels or even The Force Awakens, give it a try. It just might be the movie you've been waiting for. It was for me, and I couldn't be happier with it."
" Sheer Enough To See Through
",0.0,-0.7864,2017-05-10 00:00:00,5,"On the surface, this is a well-made action movie set within the Star Wars universe filled with nods and homages to ""A New Hope"" that will make you tingle with warm nostalgia. The reappearance of sets, costumes and characters from our favorite childhood movies might make you say ""Now, THIS is a Star Wars movie!"" However, nostalgia and making copious amounts of money on that nostalgia seemed to be Disney's primary strategy with this movie. It's mimicry, plain and simple. The CGI recreations of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher felt very dirty and a flagrant disrespect to the departed actors, not to mention jarring, for a first time viewer. The digital appearance of Grand Moff Tarkin disengaged me from the frail story and made me settle my stomach with a handful of antacid tablets.The story, writing, characterization is on-par with what you'd expect from modern cinema and the movie serves it's primary purpose of being entertaining. But, as a long-time Star Wars fan, I just couldn't help but feeling pandered to while watching this movie."
" Extremely Disappointed
",-0.5256,0.0035,2017-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I grew up a big star wars fan. I may not have gone geek over it like some do, but I have been a fan of star wars all the same from the time the very first one came out back in the 70's. 2 weekends ago we had the torrential rains and flooding here in southern Missouri, so the kids going outside to play wasn't gonna happen, on top of that, both kids and my wife were all fighting the crud that was going around at the time, so going to church on Sunday wasn't gonna happen either. Therefore we decided to go to the video store, and rent about a dozen movies, and this was one of them. I was kinda looking forward to seeing how this movie would turn out, but after watching it, I kinda wish we didn't rent it. This was nothing more than a plot hole filler, and was really just to push the story line forward between the last prequel and the start of the original movie. The dialog and special effects were lackluster and boring. A couple times during the movie I felt myself trying to nod off from sheer boredom. I really think when they finally make the last movie, that they need to just stop. They should have just stopped at return of the jedi to be honest. Was not impressed with this movie at all, so rent at your own risk. If you're a star wars geek, then you're probably in heaven with each movie release, but if you're just a regular fan like me, you're gonna be sorely disappointed with this movie."
" Star Wars A snoozefest story
",-0.5574,-0.9859,2017-05-07 00:00:00,3,"Wow this is a really dull movie, I could hardly stay awake. Edwards continues his trend of making movies that put intelligent people to sleep and entertain the simple minded masses. Three thirds of this movie don't even feel like Star Wars, could be any other sci if film. There are no jedis, no lightsabers and no space battles. Although darthvader does show up for a couple of minutes, he breaths some life into this hollow husk of a film but not enough to save the viewer from boredom. There are a lot of newly introduced characters in this movie, and they are all uninteresting and one dimensional. The actors do an okay job but it seems like they are phoning in there performance, especially the lead actress she seems very unemotional and boring. she's probably the least likable. It seems a lot like Edwards is purposely directing his actors to show as little emotion and interest in the events that are transpiring in front of them as possible. Rogue one is a weird movie in a sense; it's to fast paced at times and also to slow sometimes. Generally it's a very slow paced movie but when they're are dramatic or emotional moments that require a slower pace for them to work properly and sink in. The movie just blazes past them at a lighting pace, not allowing the audience to digest whats happening. It ends up making the more dramatic moments feel superficial and rushed. The last fourth of this movie is were it goes full Star Wars with a big space battle accompanied by a land battle going on simultaneously. This part of the movie is admittedly a little fun, but it's to late, to little to compensate for the rest. which is dull, drab, vanilla and down right boring! I really don't understand how people find this fun. My father watched this movie, and he normally loves sci fi regardless of the quality;and even he thought this was boring. It seems to me like Disney is just trying to milk the series for all it's worth, they don't care about anything else. Rogue One is defiantly the most overrated movie of 2016; it's sad that people have such low standards."
" The REAL Star Wars Prequel. It kinda has annoying problems but I like it.
",-0.1227,-0.7694,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"When I went to the theaters all I was hoping was that Rogue One doesn't mess up the entire backstory to Star Wars like The god awful prequel trilogy did. I honestly thought this was gonna be one of those Star Wars movies that's ""Just there"" but not really.... I was blown away posting at the ending. It was GRADE A Star Wars! It perfectly described what the Opening Crawl told us in A New Hope. Rogue One actually feels like its in the same Star Wars Universe as the Original trilogy And The Force Awakens(Yes I said it, GET OVER IT!) Some of the problems the movie had was that the pacing was kinda slow and sluggish and it had call backs even more unnecessary than the force awakens.... Was showing Dr. Evanzan on Jehda really necessary? Let Alone R2D2 and C3PO on the Yavin 4 base? If they showed them getting on the Tantive IV I would have forgave it more. And the lacking of character development. Chirrut and K2SO were the most unique characters in the movie. The Battle of Scarif on ground and in space was amazing. It was exactly how I imagined Star Wars. I like the idea of Jyn Erso not killing Krennic because Krennic getting killed by his own creation is a bit better than getting killed out of revenge. Hopefully they get the callback stuff out of their system and not make the pacing slow for The Last Jedi."

" The Best Star Wars Film since Empire Strikes Back
",-0.2263,0.7964,2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and the first film made since 1983 that can truly rival the original trilogy,It's better than the Prequel Trilogy (not that high of a bar other than Revenge of the Sith).It's better than the Force Awakens and it's even better than Return of the Jedi. It might even rival or be better than the original Star Wars.It's the first Star Wars film aimed at adults (although smart kids will enjoy it as well). The characters are the most realistic we've seen in a Star Wars film, but the characterizations are subtle and you have to actually pay attention to the film to truly appreciate it (which is sometimes a problem for modern audiences).The effects are pretty easily the best we've seen yet and the space battle is the first space battle to rival the one in Return of the Jedi (amazing considering that film was made in 1983).The last act of the movie is incredible, arguably the strongest act of any Star Wars film and the final sequence is simply amazing.If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't seen Rogue One stop what you are doing and watch it now."

Except...(Spoiler Alert, an indefinite spoiler). My ""except"", which is why I only rated it as a 7, is the ending. I hated it. It gutted the film for me. There, I said it.

" Good as a prequel, just OK on its own
",0.7034,0.9957,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"This movie was my most anticipated movie of 2016. I was insanely excited to see where they'd go with the story and with the characters who, based on the trailers, looked like unique and deep additions to the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, I feel as though they only got it partially right.As far as positives go, I loved what this movie did for the universe. We got multiple great new locations that all felt tangible, dirty and real: Scarif, Jedha, Eadu, and Ring of Kafrene were my favorites. The creatures, costume design, and set design were all top notch just like they were in the Force Awakens. The acting was also great across the board; I don't think there was a single performance that wasn't as good as the rest. The action is also the best in the entire franchise by far. I enjoyed every action sequence in the movie, especially the stuff on Scarif. I thought that there were two great characters in the movie: K2SO and Director Krennic. Krennic is one of the best Star Wars bad guys that we have gotten to date; his ambitions feel so grounded and he is a very different kind of character than we've seen in the past. I loved K2 because of his sarcastic personality; he is one of my favorite Star Wars droids to date. Also, this movie enhances a New Hope in so many ways. We get so much rich history on the Death Star and the intentional flaw added so much to the overall story of it. The biggest problem with this movie, however, is the characters. They, for the most part, were bland, boring, and distant. Jyn Erso's backstory is fairly confusing and is not conveyed in a way that would make the audience connect with her. She also basically has no personality; she goes from a semi-jaded Han Solo-type character in the beginning to hopefully idealistic general in the end without any real charisma. She doesn't feel like a real person. Cassian seemed to be intriguing at the beginning, but they really did not give him much of an arc and he was incredibly one- dimensional. Bodhi is the one character that was truly given nothing. He is just there as a plot device. Chirrut and Baze were fine, but were really there for humor and action and nothing else (although their friendship felt so real and tangible). The first act is also incredibly choppy and jumps between locations way too quickly. The plot really doesn't get going until the beginning of the third act because of how much they had stuffed into the first two acts. The movie just feels too overcrowded with ideas and it could have benefited from being more simple. Also, Tarkin looks fake to the point where I feel as though he should have had a smaller role. The movie, in general, also has way too much fan service. Having a cool Darth Vader scene does not make for a great movie; having great characters, on the other hand, does. Overall, Rogue One was a massive disappointment, especially after the excellently written and lively Force Awakens. Rogue One's positives outweighed the negatives, but just barely. If the characters were great, would have been able to easily overlook some of the flaws I have listed (such as the choppy story), but the characters are what make Star Wars the franchise that it is and unfortunately this movie dropped the ball in that area.5.5/10 Grade: C+"

",0.0,0.9759,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Quite how ""The Force Awakens"" can poll 8.1 while this only achieves 7.9 is beyond me. I'd award Episode VII at best 6/10. This one is significantly better - perhaps on a par with Episodes II and III - weaker than the original trilogy though.So what did it get right, and what did it get wrong? Well, the original movies succeeded so well because there were only a small band of characters to get to know - e.g. in the first film: Hans, Luke, Leia and Ben. This one introduces so many characters it's hard to know who's going to be important - then even when we work out who the main characters are, the interplay between them leaves a lot to be desired - there simply isn't enough TIME for them to properly build the characters and their relationships - everything feels a little rushed. Because of the nature of the plot, it's considerably darker than any of the other SW movies - there's very little for kids. It feels a bit like the later Harry Potter movies did - same material, but a more serious and sometimes disturbing presentation. Definitely more Terminator than Wizard of Oz.The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent - it doesn't come across as a SFX showpiece - everything feels just right - in this respect it is by far the highest quality SW movie to date.If you're a SW fan, you'll really enjoy this movie - it's almost good enough to make you forget how bad the last one was. Just not perfect. Next time, please can we focus more on a small group of characters and their interactions please!"
" This franchise has lost its way
",-0.3182,0.9719,2017-04-29 00:00:00,5,"For younger viewers Rogue One was probably just wonderful, especially if they have not seen episodes 4-6. I was a boy when the franchise began and its now utterly disappointing. The effects were always and still are unbelievable. Not so much now, but 40 years ago they were jaw dropping compared to anything we had seen. However, what made Star Wars was the story and characters. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher were visually appealing, but they were generally pretty good actors with loads of chemistry. And you got to know them because they were around for subsequent episodes. Throw in Alex Guinness, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader...what memorable and entertaining characters. There was adventure, romance, humor and the story line was night and day compared to later episodes. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna cannot carry this movie. And who comes up with these dry-as-a-bone side kicks like K-2SO? Watching Rogue my son (14 years) and myself fell asleep. Yes, its that boring and lifeless. I'll pay a couple bucks to rent the movie, but seeing it at a theater and paying ridiculous sums of money is out of the question. How to fix? Get a better script with some humor and a little sexual tension, actors and side kicks with actual chemistry and presence, and keep them around for awhile. Bring back the Star Wars we all loved and now miss."
" Not as Good as I Expected
",-0.3412,0.992,2017-04-28 00:00:00,6,"When I heard the reviews for Disney's first standalone Star Wars film, I was sure I was going to adore it. After I watched it, though, I didn't exactly feel that way.it was good, but it was not nearly as good as everyone praised it to be. It looked beautiful, that's for sure. The tone and atmosphere was awesome, because such had never been seen in a Star Wars film before. That in my opinion was the best part. The characters had the potential to be awesome and unique to the franchise; instead, they were flat without much development, some even feeling wasted (I'm talking to you, Saw). It was hard to feel their pain and like their chemistry, because we didn't have a reason to and they didn't even have much chemistry. The character with the most personality is K-2SO (who was awesome by the way, and probably the most redeeming quality. By no means is Rogue One all bad. The Darth Vader scene was amazing (the second one, of course). The scenery and character designs were awesome, and the call backs to the other movies were expertly done. I simply think overall this film is overrated and could've been a lot better."
" This film almost never goes 'Rogue'

The first two acts are a drag, but I do have to give the film credit for a couple of things: the last act is amazing and so are the two sequences featuring the best villain in cinematic history, Darth Vader! Only watch/buy this film if you want the complete knowledge of the Star Wars saga. Stick with Star Wars Rebels."
" The Star Wars space war Movie
",-0.8176,-0.455,2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"A worthy successor to the Star Wars Franchise has arrived. Gritty & realistic War movie that takes place in the fictional Star Wars universe, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like this movie. Action packed yet full of clever Star Wars references this movie digs deep into the Star Wars mythos to bring us an exciting Space Epic. Dark forces rule the Galaxy and with the absence of the Jedi Order it is up to a band of discontents led by a reluctant heroine to save the Galaxy from the newly built Death Star. The characters are all shadier than their counterparts in the Original Trilogy. In this era they are all like Han Solo. The visuals are what you would expect from a major blockbuster and once again ILM studios bring back the inventive new creatures that made the 80's installments so great. By having so much of the film set in or around a city it really brings out a war atmosphere that we see so little of in the Originals. This is a real war between two sides that really hate each other. A fact that is underscored by having figures such as Director Krennic, King Organa, Supreme commander Mon Mothma all set the scene and given greater attention than lightsaber battles."
" Now THIS is a REAL ""Star Wars"" prequel!!
",-0.6351,0.8427,2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"This was just excellent all around!! I was literally on the edge of my seat, more and more as the film progressed, right up through the end. I also was in complete awe of how WELL this tied into (and definitely had the FEEL of) the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy (Eps. IV-VI)! It sure did this long-time ""Star Wars"" fan's heart good to see maybe the BEST ""Star Wars"" movie since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - and it was about time! How anyone can say this movie isn't part of the ""Star Wars"" canon is beyond me - but in the long run, I don't care because *I* will always consider ""Rogue One"" an INTEGRAL, canonical ""Star Wars"" story. Jyn was probably the best female protagonist I've seen in an action film since Princess Leia and Ellen Ripley (of the ""Alien"" series). Also loved seeing a certain Sith Lord kick some SERIOUS butt, even though he's the ""bad guy"" - didn't matter to me - it was awesome! Lucasfilm & Co., thanks for FINALLY giving us the prequel we've been wanting so badly to see for a VERY long time!!"
" Well crafted story, well portrayed on screen
",0.4939,0.9683,2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"So, this isn't your parents' Star Wars. The first movie I ever saw in theaters was Episode 4, A New Hope. It was 1977 and I was at the ripe old age of 5. This event forever created in me a passion for the franchise. I preface this review with that statement for a reason. I had to watch this movie twice to really get the story. Not for anything done wrong on the part of those who made the movie, but more because I had gotten very use to seeing a certain set of characters in Star Wars movies to this point. This movie is well written and works within the boundaries set with the previous movies to maintain continuity, but with a whole different set of characters. It's like taking your favorite sitcom and making it from the neighbors' point of view. This is not a bad thing, but if you walk in expecting the usual, you will be disappointed. Go in expecting to see a 'fleshing out' of the Star Wars Universe, as it were, and you will be satisfied if not happy.After two viewings, this is definitely heading for my collection and will be viewed more times until I can recite lines from it as well as I can from the rest of the collection (I have destroyed VHS tapes by how often they get watched, digital is my savior).Overall, two thumbs up, ten stars, standing ovation and whatever else you want to toss in there for good measure. I liked it, then I loved it. Go watch it now!!"
" Very close to what a real fan of Star Wars universe may expect!
",-0.3802,0.9788,2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I'm a very big fan of Star Wars, especially (and like most of the people) of the first and original trilogy. Its good for any reader to know this :)First of all, I have to say that I haven't much hope about this film and its storyline, but after having watched it, woh, I was completely wrong. There is a notable variety of new characters, and their personalities engage the viewer to the story, as they have a good mixture of simplicity and charisma (particularly two of them).Apart from this, the sound-effects and the sceneries are astonishing, recovering one of the essential aspects of Star Wars films.The storyline its well constructed, connecting perfectly with the episode IV that comes consecutively. It includes a considerable number of reminders of the original trilogy, with some unexpected appearances and moments.If I had to comment something I would change, avoiding to make spoilers, is that in the opening the must have maintained the classical one with the downgoing text and the music theme.In general terms, I urgently recommend this film, all ages, with a beautiful and frenetic story, amazing OST and landscapes and unexpected situations and ending.Almost brilliant!Let the force be with you!! ;)"
" war movie with excellent special effects
",0.3612,-0.9284,2017-04-23 00:00:00,7,"this time they pick up the story before ""a new hope"". the death star is under construction. the story is about espionage activities, interrogation and sabotage. the rebellion vs the empire. it is not always clear who is good and who is evil. to me it lacks of emotion and the typical star wars strong characters and story. there is a slight attempt of the old star wars humor using the new droid but he is also more of a combatant. many combat scenes are included until the end and dominating this movie. the story and the characters are secondary and expendable it seems. power struggle within the ranks of the empire and performance of the new bad guy ""Ben Mendelsohn"" is outstanding. the effects are amazing. the end is not so very happy."
" if you love the Star Wars universe you'll love Rogue One
",0.7003,0.4826,2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"First my thoughts on the haters, if you read crap on this movie they either never liked anything about Star Wars or they aren't going to be satisfied by any new Star Wars project. Craping on Rogue One or Force Awakens is something that makes sh*t heads feel good. The fact is Rogue One was the perfect start to the Star Wars anthology series and the darkest and most adult Star Wars tail by a wide margin. It you have watch the original many time like even the mildest fans have, you will have a pretty good idea about how this is going to end but the well told story and character development will make you care about what happens to the team that sent the Death Star plans to the rebellion. If the Han Solo and Boba Fettmovies are half as good then the anthologies will do well."
" Soulless Cash Cow
",0.0,0.9706,2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"I am not a Star Wars fan, but must say that the old trilogy was and is very viable and cool, whereas newer trilogy started well, but then plunged into a total mess of a horrid making. This new pre- pre- prequel is not good. Why? Let's be honest - it's slow, it's very long, fat too much longer thane it has to be in fact. Be it 90 minutes, the world would devour it better. With its 2 endless hours run and very boring slow scenes it seems an eternity. Honest. The plot? Ah, rubbish, the obvious exploiting of far too well known scenery, places and even monsters. The main hero? Nay, she is just okay, but in a deeper sense, she is none above average and is paled into insignificance when displayed in relief of better stars. The effects? Good, but again, we have seen it all time and again. So, what remains? Nothing, in fact. Even all the recognizable characters and places do not warm up our hearts, all 2 hours an undying feeling of exasperating discomfiture does not leave us. We've been had by and racketed by greedy studio bonanzas."
" An awesome prequel and spin-off
",0.6249,0.9983,2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Well, at first I didn't know what to expect from this movie, because I tough it was a bit useless for the development of the saga. I went to the theater having watched one or two trailers at the most and I was absolutely amazed by this movie. It's like a war film in the universe of Star Wars. It's more mature and dark than many of the other movies in the saga (and by far better than Episode VII). It tells us the story of a group of rebels who stole the plans of the Death Star to try to save the rebellion. The story is well established in here, with the feeling of a Star Wars movie but with no need of light sabers and the Force (well, at least not directly). The character of Jyn Erso is portrayed by Felicity Jones in a superb way, making you feel what she feels and making you feel her pain, anger or hope. The other actors were also great, with the Mexican Diego Luna in the role of the Captain Andor, and also the two Asian actors in the roles of Chirrut and Baze, and the Hindu pilot Bodhi Rock. I have to mention the father of Jyn, played by Mads Mikkelsen, another great actor with a great performance. Also a special mention to the new droid K-2SO which surely will become a favorite, and Ben Mendelshon as the Imperial Director Krennic, an awesome new character full of power. There are other secondary characters that felt like a bit off place, like Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker).One of the best parts of the film is the last third of it (no spoilers, don't worry), with all the space battles and so that remind me a lot of all the other Star Wars movies, and that makes you feel like the director is a true fan of the saga and he tried to give it that feeling, and for me, he achieved it. It's true that some parts around the middle of the film make it feel a bit long, but it's worth to watch it just for the beautiful and awesome cinematography and visuals, all with a score by Michael Giacchino (not Williams but still great) and one of the best scenes of the whole Star Wars saga (when you watch it, you'll know it)I recommend it to any fan of Star Wars who wants to expand this universe, to the fans who felt the Ep VII wasn't bad, but wasn't great neither (a bit mediocre), but also to anyone who is not a fan of Star Wars but wants to enjoy a great action film with spectacular visuals."
" Darth Vader is truly impressive :)
",0.8481,0.9982,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Reviewing the movie: ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (8/10 stars)The previous film; ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", was such a disappointment to me that I wasn't expecting R1 to be any good. However, I'm glad to say those 2 movies are nothing alike.R1 felt true to the original spirit of the first Star Wars movie (episode4) and feels like it sits perfectly as episode 3½ (which I suppose it's aiming for, although not officially, given the story- line)There was nothing that felt out-of-place or 'wrong', in how it told the story preceding episode 4, which actually is a bit stunning considering the movie is made 40 years after episode 4.This is VERY well done! :)Not even the hair-styles felt out of place.Also, thank the force, there was no Jar Jar Binks.So, the story fits, the visuals fit, the sounds fit, in pretty much all regards R1 feels like a true Star Wars film. Understanding how much Star Wars have become almost a kind of religion to fans, that is a really huge accomplishment.George Lucas himself messed up with episode 1, 2 and 3 (and to some extent also with his re-makes of episode 4, 5 and 6 (although, in all fairness, I do like the remade version of Jabba the Hutt more than the original human character (played by Thomas Declan Mulholland) that was supposed to be in the very first release of episode 4, but ended up as a deleted scene))And Jeffrey Jacob ""J.J."" Abrams, who directed episode 7 is just no good at directing (He's good at producing though). Even though he has a cool middle-name he has not directed a single movie I liked (""Mission: Impossible III"" was OK, but the rest of his directing- work is all terrible)So, as a long time fan of Star Wars, watching episode 3½ was like seeing the first real new Star Wars film since episode 6 (from 1983) So for me there are 4 real Star Wars films; episode 4, 5, 6 and now; 3½.So is there nothing wrong or bad to say about this new one? Yes; the 3D version was 'fake 3D' (as in; a conversion from 2D to 3D), although a very well made 'fake 3D'. If you don't know what to look for, you may not notice it's a conversion, but once you know what 'real 3D' looks like; you can tell it's a conversion. It's not really a problem, unless you're a purist. In my world; 'fake 3D' (conversions from 2D) is to 'real 3D' what CGI-characters like Jar Jar Binks is to real people; just stupid and annoying.Speaking of CGI-characters; it was actually quite fun to see how Governor Tarkin and princess Leia was brought to life in this. In episode 4 Tarkin is played by Peter Wilton Cushing (He made some seriously cool cult horror-films in the old days. Actually he's made a ton of cool films. A magnificent actor. One of the few really great ones), who passed away in 1994. I guess in the near future real actors will no longer be needed, since it's now possible to hire any face you want. They weren't perfect (the facial movements and eyes still don't look fully natural), but they were close (If you don't know the original actors It IS possible you wouldn't notice). Especially Leia (although she only had one scene, where Tarkin had a full role)About the story; ever since the original in 1977, female protagonists have been common. This one is no exception. Actually it takes it a bit further; this time the main-lead, Jyn (played by Felicity Rose Hadley Jones), is a full-on solo lead. I guess you could say it does in fact deviate a bit from the originals here, in that we only really get one main-lead. She does have friends that help, but it's not quite the band, or group of close friends, of leads, all with their own personal story-line, like we saw in the originals.It gives it a bit of a Joan-of-Arc feel, which actually works very well for the story and how it plays out. I don't know if that was an intentional decision, but it happens to fit the story perfectly.Finally; Darth Vader is, and here it comes across even better than in the originals, just the most formidable villain in all movie- history. The main scene he has in R1 is just too cool. So super awesomely cool that it is down-right epic! Who ever designed that scene... wrote it, filmed it, edited it, lighted it, the lot... that crew is just a pack of pure genius talent! I was just blown away by that scene :) THAT was the REAL Darth Vader right there. Fantastic.That's it. What a cool film :)"
" stand alone movie
",-0.25,0.659,2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"As a stand alone movie barely OK (so the 5 was generous). Character development is non existent for example. Some information about whats going (hopping between planets).As a part of the bigger story, 1 star, mentioning something about the force perhaps? And consistency is a real let down here as well, robots in the past where far more advanced then in the future?"
" A good Star Wars prequel
",-0.1779,0.7832,2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"That almost sounds like a contradiction in terms, after the last three efforts. For the first time in decades, we have a Star Wars film with a good, solid story that hangs together. It also ties in nicely with Episode IV.There is a great multinational cast. The acting is good, and the characters are unusually believable and vivid for a Star Wars film.It is still your classic space opera, with space battles, laser gunfights, and the usual smorgasbord of visuals. However, there are darker, more gritty elements in the story. Some Star Wars devotees might find that a bit of a con, preferring their entertainment more lighthearted. There are others, though, for whom it makes the film more absorbing."
" Very good movie ......
",0.4927,0.9599,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"30I just watched it again and I will say that on the first go around I was not impressed or should I say I thought it was boring. But then I watched it this morning on PPV from 7:30- 9:30. It had me in suspense and glued to the TV this morning. It ties right into the original one, which I say back in 77-78 at a theater on Randolph AFB in San Antonio. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie, the acting is very good and the story line fits. Oh and the special effects are over the top. All the characters fit the story line."
" Good Movie with Some Major Plot Holes
",0.4404,-0.9887,2017-04-20 00:00:00,7,"When I watch a movie, I want it to make sense. There were numerous scenes in this movie that do not make sense to me. Here are just a few of these issues.When Cassian is sent to assassinate Erso, their ship crashes and there is no communication back to the rebel base. At this point, the rebel commander sends in his ships to bomb the entire place. Why not just do that in the first place?Secondly, why do the rebels want to assassinate Erso? The death star is already operational. His only value to the rebels now is to get information about how to destroy it. The kill order makes no sense; capture would make much more sense.Finally, at the end of the movie there are hundreds of tie fighters flying around and not one of them gets the order to destroy the satellite. Have a fighter shoot down this satellite and the death star plans will never leave the planet. They use the death start to blow up the entire city just minutes after the plans are received by the rebels. Why not before?This all being said, it's a very interesting movie and is thematically different from the rest of the Star Wars movies."

" Skull-burningly boring, miserable.
",-0.6705,-0.8803,2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"While I did not grow up anywhere near the release of the original trilogy of the star wars series, I did grow up watching them again and again on VHS tape. The original trilogy, and even the prequels to a degree, presented a bright, fun world full of intrigue, action and adventure.The fact that on my very first viewing of 'Rouge One', I actually fell asleep half way though the movie, tells you everything you need to know. I attempted to watch the movie a second time, and once again dozed off at a few points, relying on my family to periodically wake me up so that I didn't miss the plot too much.This movie's attempts to breakaway from high fantasy action-adventure, and make a dark, gritty sci-fi, has resulted on one of the most insultingly dull movies that I have been made to sit through. Most of the story is an unintelligible confusing mess, impossible to follow plot, no lovable or relatable characters, and an annoying monk who won't stop chanting (which is WAY more annoying that it sounds, trust me).This movie attempts to fill in the gap between Episodes 3 and 4, and does a pretty poor job. If the first hour and twenty minutes had been cut from this movie, and the last forty or so left in, it would have turned out exactly the same, in terms of plot. We didn't learn anything worthwhile or important during the set up, just a fairly good action climax at the end. Even the ending stand-off between the opposing sides felt like a watching a video-game, rather than a good movie.I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie, as it is a failure as a Star Wars title, and a movie in general. Or, just skip three-quarters of the way into the run time, and watch from there. The anti-hero side character has an annoying voice too. Everything that's meant to be chilling or gripping, like the monk or the anti-hero, come across as boring, or annoying, and in this case, both.I do not believe that the director could have watched this movie back and felt proud of it, as it is just outright uninspired. Pointless Star Wars title that should never have been made. I would EASILY consider this to be the worst Star Wars movie that I have ever seen. (yes, even the Phantom Menace was better. WAY better.)"
" A good movie, an average Star Wars movie
",-0.1779,0.8831,2017-04-18 00:00:00,6,"This film had a lot of hype which had me thinking it would make up for the rather ""rinse & repeat"" story that was used for episode 7. But I don't think it was as good as episode 7.I love aerial dogfights & ones in space are even better. So with a title with a homage to Rogue Squadron I was hoping for a lot of spaceship on spaceship action.Sadly, there was only one big ship fight at the end (which was quite good but nothing better than what's been in other Star Wars films before) & a hit & run strike attack by some X-wings on an Imperial base. Some what lackluster given the title of the film.Most of the characters were interesting enough but I only felt bad at the death of K-2SO. However the two lead characters weren't as iconic as I would have hoped. Cassian just felt like a poor mans Han Solo & we were told about how awesome Jyn was & were just expected to like her. It's hard to love a character when you only hear about their actions & all their on screen actions are bland & uninteresting.The final fight between the Alliance & the Empire had its moments, but it was mostly just duck & cover generic blaster fighting. No one/moment particular stood out.Vader's appearance at the end was a welcome change of pace & a much needed refresher of just how badass of a character he is. Outside of videogames, we've never seen Vader be so brutal & ruthless in a combat scenario. But again, this one 20 second scene just reminded me why made Star Wars stands out from all the other generic scifi films there are out there. I'm not saying Star Wars can't have a good story without the force, lightsabers, Jedi, Sith etc. But rather that a story needs great characters for it to be truly memorable & I feel Rogue one did not live up to those standards.Overall the film was good. But for a Star Wars film I would expect much better."
" Very poor
",-0.5256,-0.9093,2017-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Not sure this adds anything. It is disjointed, there is some appalling acting, and too much mumbling. The picture is dimly lit, there is far too much cgi (including the infamous cgi mask of Peter Cushing) and quite frankly the story often makes no sense. Perhaps Sir Alec Guinness was right when he thought the Star Wars trilogy was tosh. If only it had stopped at the trilogy. Now it's just about making more and more money."
" Instant Classic
",0.0,0.9927,2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One is comfortably the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. So I'll tell you where I'm at. I love the original films - I grew up with them as a child of the 80s. I think the prequels are rubbish, I don't really watch cartoons and the Force Awakens left me cold. Personally I thought Star Wars was done. But at least I had the original films. Untouchable. So I thought...I walked out of the cinema totally satisfied I had seen an instant classic. It is bold, exciting, funny, tragic and most of all entertaining. I won't go into the story, as most people know that its how the rebels stole the plans to the Death Star, which was destroyed in Star Wars (1977) Rogue One manages in its 2 hours 10 mins run time to bring together a motley crew of characters, give them each sufficient screen time for you to care about them before putting them on a suicide mission. Its a true ensemble piece, and almost feels like The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen or the Wild Bunch in space. As the film was playing I felt it was good, then towards the end I thought wow they are actually going to do it. They are actually all going to die and the last 40 minutes are incredible. As I was reeling from this, the director Gareth Edwards then produces the real moment of the film. The jewel in the crown. Darth Vader after taking a back seat for most of the film, after many security failures by Krennic (a fantastic little worm of a character played by the terrific Ben Mendelsohn) takes matters into his own hands in brutal fashion. Following this scene, the film ends with Princess Leia, as Star Wars begins.The film has many strengths. Gareth Edwards being the key. He hasn't just made a lazy remake of the original. This film stands alone, yet fits totally alongside the first three in style, execution and with panache.I just want to touch on the humour as well. It has moments of humour that does not resort to slap stick as seen in the horrific prequels, where CGI creatures fart or C3P0's head ends up on another droids body (really? yep it really happened) Yes, finally a film that cares for its characters more than the CGI. Yes, this is the film that gave Darth Vader his balls back. Yes, this is the film that dared kill off the whole cast. Yes, the Star Wars film that highlights how bad the prequels and The Force Awakens is. Yes, I loved it. Can you tell?"

" Not perfect but a massive improvement on Force Awakens
",0.459,0.9412,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"I didn't turn out to see this at the cinema - the first Star Wars movie I've ever missed. I was so disgusted with JJ Abrahams' soulless, shameful plot-holed rip-off The Force Awakens I stayed at home and saved my cash. But, like the dutiful Star Wars fan that I am, I gave this a try on blue-ray....and was pleasantly surprised.Rogue One is not perfect - indeed its third act, the one supposedly changed by the studio, merely rehashes the original trilogy again to a large extent. with Imperial Walkers guarding the storage facility where the Death Star plans are hidden, charges planted, etc. The ground battle resembles Return Of the Jedi's sans Ewoks!But I liked the story overall. This is a grittier version of the Rebel Alliance than any yet seen. It had some weight to it; and the sense of desperation engulfing the rebels is well-realised. This is not a romp. And it isn't intended to be.The cast felt better than those in Force Awakens. A strong female lead, yes; but not a perfect jedi master without training Rey, or a sanitary attendant leading an assault on the 3rd Death Star. No emo sith-lord wannabes. Hurrah!Characters are good. Needed a little more depth to really work. Donny Yen's character is great, but he needed more screen time. The best of them is surely the reprogrammed Imperial droid. He was great. Diego Luna was excellent.Some downsides. Vader looked odd in his brief scenes. His mask/helmet was far less imposing; almost like something is missing. His first scene was pretty poor, his battle with the rebels much more like it. The CGI Tarkin was not good. The actor voicing him sounded nothing like Peter Cushing to my ears. If only Peter were still with us. What a class act he was. Leia's CGI was a bit better - probably because it was much briefer.Director Garath Edwards did a fine job with this. Much better than the hack Abrahams. I enjoyed this film, liked the references to Kyber Crystals etc. but please no more Death Stars. Star Wars needs to move forward now, and give us something new. Not sure Last Jedi is going to deliver it...but fingers crossed."
" Episode 3.9
",0.0,-0.7774,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Rogue One has finally accomplished something that I might not have known was possible, Retro-Science-Fiction. Fads like steam-punk may be a stylized play on outdated technology, but Rogue One is something special. With prequals like The Phantom Menace and Prometheus, they are made after their source material but it's hard to believe they take place prior. Try as they might, filmmakers can't help themselves, they gloss up the production value and inert updated technology that undermines the story that should be taking place in the past. Rogue One fits like a forgotten puzzle piece to the Star Wars Universe, a veritable Episode 3.5. Everything down to the knobs on the control panels fit into the ""New Hope"" aesthetic. And with how the story hugs so satisfyingly closely to Episode IV, it might be more appropriate to think of it at Episode 3.9.The story of Rogue One is mentioned without many specifics in Episode IV. Once by the roundtable heads of the Empire and also by the rebel base, referring to a great sacrifice made to obtain plans for a weapon of unimaginable scale. Rogue One takes our intimate knowledge of the original trilogy and monopolizes on it, sometimes shamelessly. Fans will never forget the look on Leia's face when Alderaan is destroyed with a single blow, followed by Ben's philosophical understanding ""Millions of voices cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced."" We know the deadly potential of this machine, Rogue One counts on it. The movie doesn't earn the audience's investment in the story so much as throw fuel onto a fire that hasn't been snuffed in 40 years. When an Imperial Engineer named Gelen Erso is forced out of hiding to build the moon-sized weapon, we will the story to throw anything familiar at us. Rogue One has almost nothing new up its sleeve, its greatest strength.The daughter of Erso is Jyn (Felicity Jones), a rebel to both the Empire and Rebel Alliance. One of the beauties of Rogue One is how it doesn't paint a hard line between the Empire and Rebels as good guy/bad guy. The Empire has made the galaxy too desperate. Our idea of the Rebel Alliance from Episodes 4-6 may come across as endearingly rag-tag, but Rogue One presents them as a nearly lost cause with dark characters we begrudgingly accept. The rebels take what they can get, and some vibrant pseudo-heroes make up the bulk of Rebel Fighters. Cassian (Diego Luna) fits these criteria. We first see him painted into a corner by Storm Troopers, how he escapes can't be called ""honorable."" Jyn has reasons to hate the empire, but the methods of the Rebels don't act as a lightning-rod for moral unity.Jyn is much like Leia, beautiful but not ""gifted"" with abilities. Her heroics stem more from a firm heart than a midichlorian count. She is not taken into the rebel base because of skill, but because of heredity. Erso is the head engineer in the Death Star project, and a glimmer of hope comes when Jyn reveals his allegiance is not one of morals but desperation. He is playing a dangerous game of wits, in the heart of the lion's den. Erso's counterpart is a sinister rebel, Saw Gerrera (Forrest Whitaker), who shows what will become of a man who opposes the Empire physically. Decades of fighting have left him more machine than man. There is the obligatory wise-cracking robot, but Rogue One is far and away the darkest chapter in the Star Wars universe.I mentioned that the film can be shameless in its monopolization of our knowledge of Star Wars. This allows for clever bits of dialogue and references that will make you nudge the person next to you. Things go a bit too far when CGI characters like the bullies from the Tatooine Cantina show up and disappear for no other reason than familiarity. However, for every scene like this there a dozen that respect the viewer and hone the edges of the story to fit into the saga seamlessly. Liberties are taken with cinematography and art but never story. If The Force Awakens was an enjoyable addition to the series, Rogue One is invaluable excavation of the holy trilogy, giving everything deeper meaning."
" My new personal favorite
",0.4588,0.864,2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"Fabulous, a Star Wars movie that takes its theme completely seriously. I ditched High School the day I saw the first movie, and I don't think I've found any of the sequels quite as satisfying, until now. Having met Peter Cushing as a young teenager at the 2nd Annual Famous Monsters of Film convention, it was great to see him resurrected for the film in a role most sinister. And having lost Carrie Fisher recently, her digital appearance as a young Princess Leia is also too cool. I've had some trepidations over the idea of Disney taking over Lucas Films. But frankly, if this is an example of the caliber of what they will produce in the future, this galaxy is in good hand."
" Why so serious?
",-0.1513,-0.1393,2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"Rogue One is a quality movie. However I have a hard time seeing it as a star wars movie. It's very dark and depressing throughout the movie, Even the prequels, which were absolutely horrible movies, were more fun then Rogue One. Also in the begging of the movie the movies cuts to like 3 locations in 5 minutes. I know they want to build the setting, but its too much. I still find this movie quite enjoyable and it deserves most of the praise it gets, however it will never be a true Stars Wars."
" The missing piece
",-0.296,0.9976,2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"When Rogue One was released, I didn't have any particular expectation about it. I was quite disappointed by the Force Awakens released a few months earlier but as many of my friends who happen to be great Star Wars fans begged me to go see it, I've given up and gave it a shot. And I don't regret anything about it.Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we should all expect to see. It has the sense of epicness the previous trilogies have, the same taste of visual and sound marvel and they have characters we could truly identify with. It has also some very well placed dose of humor which is welcome to enlighten the mood a little.Because we should not be mistaken about it: this movie is very dark as it's the direct prelude of Episode IV where the Empire is ruthless as ever without any sight of hope to see. The Alliance is still burgeoning and struggling to survive and almost to the point of breaking up and surrender. The only hope will come through this bunch of ordinary heroes who are willing to risk everything including giving up their lives to give the Alliance that will which would allow them to defeat Evil.Jyn Erso has nothing special just like we thought Luke was before we learned of his past. She is the daughter of a genius scientist who got kidnapped by the Empire to create what will become the Death Star. Trying to survive on her own, she is rescued by the Alliance so she could help them locate her father and destroy the Death Star before it's becoming operational. Here begins an epic journey which will drive them to go straight in the clutch of their enemies to steal the blueprints of the deadliest and most powerful weapon ever and finally give the galaxy a new hope to triumph from Evil.This movie has so many assets and it uses it very efficiently. First it has a true purpose as it's the last piece of the puzzle. It explains us and give us many answers to questions which were left as a mystery. For example we never knew if that fatal flow of the Death Star which caused her explosion was an accidental mishap or a deliberate attempt to thwart the project. With Rogue One that mystery is answered. We also know how Tarkin got control of the Death Star or how Leia got involved with all of this. Rogue One in that aspect was necessary.Second it allowed us to meet again characters we fought long gone like Governor Tarkin, Gold Leader, Red Leader, Bail Organa or young Leia thanks to the incredible ingeniousness of Light & Magic. Those people are so talented it's mesmerizing. They deserve an award just for being able to recreate those legendary characters and inserting them into that newly created story. It was ambitious and risky but it worked to the perfection. I had a chill watching them coming back to life once again. It was eerie. And of course we meet Darth Vader once again. That part was probably the best one ever of the movies. Rogue One surely wrote another part of the legend of Darth Vader. The two scenes he appears are chilling and breathtaking truly showing how raw and powerful this legendary character is! That was something Gareth Edwards did very great.Now let's talk about the locations: Scarif is breathtaking. It truly looks like a postcard place with its sandy beaches, teal waters and tree palms if only it wasn't used as the Archives of the Empire and the main scene of a destructive and bloody battle. Jeddah is the recurring sandy planet each Star Wars is obliged to have but it's still very interesting to see with its atmosphere and great array of population communities, one of another recurring theme every Star Wars Movie has to show.Finally the musical score. As a Star Wars movie, its score has to match the epic feeling of the movie, the tension of the scenes. Michael Giacchino did a great job at it especially the final battle which was a real pleasure to the ear. If it was John Williams well I wouldn't be surprised one bit, but for a newcomer, it's impressive so great job Michael.So to conclude, Rogue One deserves to be considered as canon. It has it all: the epic story, the great cast, the visual masterpiece, the music score and the creativity. George Lucas once told that among all the movies Disney released since they took over, Rogue One was by far his favorite. Well I cannot agree more when you see how disgraceful Star wars has become since then."
" Unnecessary Sacrifice
",0.0,0.9289,2017-04-14 00:00:00,6,"Recently Star Wars Universe has become more laid back and entertaining. With younger auditory oriented animation series, Rebels and Clone Wars, and the greatest fan fiction of it all, The Force Awakens, Star Wars seems to loose its burden of tragedy and titanic struggle of few against many. So, Rogue One is an effort to remedy this...Nabooo sunshine with some inferno of Mustafar. Does it work? Well, what does work is a path well trodden - establishing a likable company of heroes, to become the core of future movies and probably TV series. Felicity Jones is energetic, dark, impulsive and virtually non-stoppable. Diego Luna is absolutely stunning and very charismatic. Donnie Yen is a great addition to Star Wars universe, his role is sadly smaller than it should be but he is definitely an actor and martial artist new Star Wars need. And thus, the company gathered, and they all together proceed to...And here follows a strange turn of events. You see, true tragedy lies not in numbers but in depth. There are many deaths in this movie. And they all sort of look like...unnecessary. They all happen in period of ...about 20 minutes of movie time and look more like a hasty wrap-up of urgent movie production issues than a coherent movie story.Agreed, sometimes numbers are in place. In episode III, the massacre of jedies was in tune with the dark storyline, descending into the abyss, but here....it doesn't work. Jyn Erso's struggle to clear her father's name and to become his legacy of freedom and redemption, aspiring higher and higher up to the top of Scarif tower, is impressive and visually symbolic. But the sacrifices....however justified by the highest goal and the better good...do not, historically look like the Battle of Iwo Jima, but more like the trenches of World War One..."

" Who would have thought that a Star Wars film could be dreadfully dull?
",-0.875,0.9546,2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"After the disappointing fan-ficish feminist retread that was TFA, I for the first time had no anticipation for another Star Wars film. It wasn't so much that I was determined to boycott the franchise, as much as there just didn't seem to be much of anything to interest me in it anymore. So when Rogue One came out, I felt no desire to see the film. It came to the theaters and went with little notice from me.But I read many reviews that claimed this one was significantly better than TFA. So I decided to give it a shot on RedBox, and I'm sorry I spent the money. It was indeed better than TFA, but not much.This film did do some things well. The art direction for one. In TFA, the warmed up Ralph McQuarrie leftovers made the franchise feel like it was cannibalizing itself. Here though, the McQuarrie designs are welcome since they go a long way to depict this particular period in Star Wars lore. I would also argue that visually, Rogue One does capture the epic nature of a galaxy wide war, in contrast to TFA which visually felt like a small made-for-television effort.The special effects are great, and the battle scenes are well done.Unfortunately, the plot and characters fall flat.I have to admit here, that the unthinking political rants from the screenwriters biased my viewing, so I was expecting empty social justice drivel. Thankfully there's little of that, but ultimately the plot was a story that didn't feel like it needed to be told. Stealing the Death Star plans. It seems that the few lines in Episode IV that summed this up were quite enough. A 2 hour film to flesh out a detail just doesn't feel necessary here.The characters were intensely uninteresting. There's an eye rolling moment where Jyn beats down about a half dozen armed, trained, and armored stormtroopers with a stick. Apparently this was where we were supposed to hear Jyn's womanhood roar, and there really doesn't appear to be more to her character than that. There's a couple of scenes where Jyn is lecturing the older and wiser leadership of the Rebellion, and giving a speech to some grizzled soldiers in an attempt to inspire them. Why wasn't anyone asking who let this naive inexperienced girl into the room? Why would anyone listen to her?The robot attempts at humor fell flat. The blind Jedi wannabe would have been far more interesting if he had been made a last remaining Jedi with an actual lightsaber. What is with Disney's obsession with having heroes bringing sticks to a blaster fight? Cassian felt like a poor man's Biggs Darklighter. Forest Whitaker was there for gravitas apparently. The rest of the characters were just...there. Oh, and the evil Empire was a bunch of old white men. Surprise, surprise.The last Darth Vader sequence was pretty cool, we never really saw DV in full action like that before. But I could have waited for that clip to come out on YouTube.This diminishes my interest in Episode VIII, which I just saw the trailer for today. It looks like Rey is still wearing her stanky Jakku fatigues. Pew!Behold; you are witnessing the death of a franchise in slow motion."
" Convincing nostalgia shipment
",0.4019,0.9917,2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,"Convincing nostalgia shipment.Congratulation to the producers and directors. A classic fantasy action flick, well entertaining. A worthy sequel of the Star Wars saga. Although you'll see a lot of its known gear movie-recycled again, robots, space ships etc., don't worry, it just adds to the fun. Way better IMO than the new sequels of the Star Trek saga. Graphics, CGI are remarkably excellent, and yet without excessive overuse. The story is surely simple, but solid, good enough. For the sake of the fun, a new robot is introduced, with better entertaining qualities than the previous R2-D2 IMO. Also in general the humor is appropriate and adds to the fun. A great Forest Withaker in a minor role.The movie rides on nostalgia wave, intentionally maybe, but never mind, it pays off."
" This is the best Star Wars movie
",0.1531,-0.7506,2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,My god is this movie good. This is what I have wanted from Star Wars since A New Hope came out. This is better than any other movie in the Star Wars universe. I left with my jaw opened. This is what you stuck through the prequels for why you forgot that they made episode 7. This is Star Wars the way Timothy Zahn would have showed it. This is what we have always wanted in Star Wars. Forgive and forget the Force Awakens and watch this.
" Star Wars Suicide Squad
",-0.8442,-0.99,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job with the slimmest of story lines, which consists of the rebel alliance stealing the plans for the Death Star that lead into the original Star Wars, A New Hope.The Good: The cast is excellent, and the new characters are hugely likable. The best of these are Baze and Chirrut, one a badass warrior and the other a blind monk with some serious skills and a love of The Force. I could easily have watched a whole movie featuring just these two as the protagonists. Felicity Jones is believable as Jyn, the daughter of the Death Star's chief architect who joins the rebellion to lead a rag-tag team to retrieve the plans for the Emperor's ultimate weapon. Diego Luna and Riz Ahmed also bring their A Game. The droid K-2SO is also a welcome addition to the crew, a classic Star Wars droid if ever there was one. Ben Mendelsohn is a decent villain, if a little one note, and both Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen provide good support.The battle scenes are fantastic, possibly the best I've ever seen in the Star Wars universe. Even the smaller street battle scenes are masterful and expertly crafted. The Death Star has never been better or more fearsome. Its destruction of a city is just visually stunning. The space battles are pure old skool Star Wars and full of excitement and tension. There's one scene in particular where a ramming ship pushes one Star Destroyer into another and it just looks incredible. But all this eye candy aside the ultimate scene is towards the end when Darth Vader makes a last ditch attempt to retrieve the stolen plans and takes out a whole squadron of rebels single-handedly in a small corridor, in a scene so badass it will surely become iconic.The Not So Good: There's not much here I didn't enjoy, and it feels harsh ragging on such a great movie, but it wasn't the greatest idea to include a CGI Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin. He just isn't convincing, and it was giving me bad flashbacks to some of the terrible CGI in The Phantom Menace. If they'd used him for one small scene maybe shaded in darkness it could have worked, but he appears in quite a few long scenes and it really takes you out of the moment. Princess Leia looks even worse, and again was there really any need to show a close up of her badly computerized face? Maybe a long distant shot would have worked better. Small complaints though, and they don't spoil an otherwise hugely enjoyable experience.Leia's final words in Rogue One are ""hope"". Well this movie has given me hope, hope that those soul destroying prequels are fading into the ether and the Star Wars franchise is back on track."

It is right in the middle of episode 3 and 4. I was talking to my wife about this, saying how it makes you wonder how Star Wars would had fare if they actually released the movies in the true order or like how it it was with the bouncing around the different chapters. I will say none of them could ever be as good as the true first released episode, but this movie is the closest to being on par with the first one. Truly a cinematic masterpiece."
" A lot better than Episode 7
",0.4404,0.921,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"I became a Star Wars fan after watching the original trilogy in the 70s onward. Yeah, I am already old. I was disappointed in the prequels and Episode 7 for the simple reason that they did not get the flavor of the original trilogy, in my opinion, and relied too much on special effects instead of storytelling and characterization. Rogue One, on the other hand, had that feel of the original Star Wars and even though the film was almost like the original trilogy in terms of having characters that were like Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca in android form, and Ben Kenobi (the purpose and traits of each character are a bit similar to the original characters), the story was a good prequel to A New Hope, Episode 4. It might have fight scenes reminiscent of the old trilogy but overall the storytelling was gripping enough to hold my interest and made me see why the original trilogy was such a hit critically and commercially. I am glad I watched this after seeing Episode 7 which made me vow to stop watching its sequels, especially now that Carrie Fisher is dead. Oh, this reminds me that the film could have benefited with a better CGI for two well-known characters."

There is nothing left to learn on this subject except why Stormtroopers always move at the trot. IMDb suggests a budget of $200mm. Clearly less than 1% spent on a script that makes any sense at all. Seems to consist of bits and pieces badly stapled together...with little plot or continuity from scene to scene. This is a shame...as...some of the characters had great promise.

I liked the disparate group of characters so much that I almost felt as though I didn't need any glimpses of the original cast (CGI versions and robots).Some of the 70's design sat a little uneasily in this 21st century effort - the plastic cubes representing rank for example and of course the computer graphics - although necessary -looked very old school - but were charming all the same.The battle scenes were very well played out - and extremely violent - so this was not a kids film like the 1977 classic. If I have a small criticism of the war scenes I thought the editing was a bit perfunctory in some sections - it could have been more inventive along with the score. It was as though - this is what a Star wars battle should look like - so we'll edit it this way.Overall though a very enjoyable - and dark - film. I would have liked to have seen more of this group in another adventure - but alas it cannot be.
" All out British casting, sounds like a gang from South London
",0.3612,-0.4995,2017-04-10 00:00:00,1,Is it just me who is irritated by this or? Nearly the whole casting is British speaking with strong British accent. So they are trying to sell us that in the far far future where nations have unavoidably become so mixed they managed to find a group where 90% are from London or a London suburb. And they kept their British accent after 2000 years intact. That is ridiculous and very off-putting. I personally live in London and the dialogues sound like some people talking down at the pub...Just couldn't get over it. Imagine that you are from Paris and the whole crew in the film speaks with Algerian accent. I mean what are the odds? It's something like that. very stupid and very unrealistic. Is there anybody else annoyed with this?
" An impressively dark 'Star Wars' story
",-0.1531,-0.9239,2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan."

The supreme enemy guerilla commander is as useful as an appendicitis or Ivanka Trump. But, now all markets and shops are full of the new characters and dolls so mission accomplished. Disney and its directors seem more worried about merchandising that the film itself. Now we have a rejected teenage chick with serious psychological problems (yes chick all lead characters nowadays by law have to be chicks btw I am a girl and I am being insulted!) who is killing his father (looks like Disney loves to copy and replicate this plot line every single time) again. A girl who lived on a deserted planet and finds a rebel with a secret message, wow, what an explosion of imagination.

Anyway...My comment would not be a review if the forums were still alive but here it goes.This movie is truly a respectable tribute to Star Wars. It should have premiered before that awful episode 7 from J.J. Abrams. And definitely should be the box-office hit that episode 7 was.The story is believable, the narrative is well paced and has a clear direction. The characters are well introduced. The casting is great. The actor's performance was amazing (Forrest Whitaker, although I love the guy, might have overacted a bit). Donnie Yen was amazing. I would definitely watch a movie with his adventures.Lots of throwback moments: great sceneries, loads of vehicles (Tie-fighters, X-wings, AT-AT, Shuttles, Imperial Destroyer, Death Star,...), Darth Vader (he even fights rebel troops!), R2D2, C3PO, dogfights, storm-troopers vs rebels, etc.My only pet peeve was the human CGI characters (Tarkin and Leia). Although the animation was great you can clearly notice they are CGI. They could find another way of tying this story to the other story lines (eps. 1 to 7).That's pretty much it. Money people should give this director some credit and some more monies and let him do his thing.(bring the forums back m0r0n5)"
" Not as good as I thought it would be SPOILERS
",-0.3412,-0.862,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"As a long time Star Wars fan and collector of course I was interested in seeing this film and add it to my video collection.We knew most characters would not make it into the storyline of the first film.I am disappointed with the film.Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera character. He did nothing. Save Jyn then disappeared just to send her on her way to get the Death Star plans. Killed off before half way through the film. Disappointing.New droid K-2SO. Did not like the character at all. Former Imperial Droid. They sure did not reprogram that droid well. I did not like most of the characters responses & actions. So the only good droid activity in the film was the R2-D2 and C-3PO appearance.CGI Tarkin I liked how the character looked but they did not get the voice, close but not quite good enough. The short CGI Leia. One word & very short screen appearance. Did not really liked how the character looked, not as good a job as they did on Tarkin.I was looking forward to seeing Vader. Does not get much screen time but I was disappointed on how his voice sounded. They got James to do the voice again so why did it sound like they turned the sound down on the voice? I did not like that, otherwise his limited screen time was good.The final battle with the X-Wings and the AT-AT's was good. Overall though some of the effects were not up to Star Wars standards.So sorry to say as a long time fan I was disappointed & awaiting The Last Jedi."
" So Good, You'll Almost Forget There Were Other Prequels
",0.379,0.985,2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Visual story-telling takes over for clunky dialogue in what is surely the most mature ""Star Wars"" entry since ""The Empire Strikes Back."" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" -- the first of many planned off- shoots for the rejuvenated franchise -- goes back in time to tell the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and a crew of rebels who are tasked with finding the plans to the original Death Star, all leading up to the franchise's ""proper"" beginning, ""A New Hope."" Not your kid's ""Star Wars,"" this story is a little deeper and a lot darker than the fare we've grown accustomed to since ""Return of the Jedi"" and the cartoon-ish prequels.Stepping into the director's chair is Gareth Edwards, who brought us the revamped ""Godzilla"" just a few years back. His strong visual sense serves ""Star Wars"" well. While the script doesn't always deliver much for surprises, the lush landscapes and mind-bending special effects more than make up the difference. Unlike, say, ""The Force Awakens,"" this is the sort of movie you could put on mute (or, better yet, isolate the soundtrack) and still get sucked into. Showing a restraint with CGI that few filmmakers in this day and age understand, Edwards even somehow manages to make CGI renderings of two iconic but absent actors -- a dicey proposition -- without slipping into some Playstation 3-grade graphics (think Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""cameo"" in ""Terminator: Salvation"") or offending the viewer's intelligence. As always, your mileage may vary, but to the unbiased eye, this is as good as it gets. It helps that these elements are used sparingly and only out of necessity.The merry band of rebels here are a varied bunch. We get Forest Whitaker playing a kook and loving it, while Mads Mikkelsen works towards shedding his typecast role as a creepy villain. Fittingly, the best of the bunch would be Alan Tudyk's turn as the droid K-2SO, who steals virtually every scene he appears in. We also get a taste of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and cameos from C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee stepping in for the late Kenny Baker). Heck, we even get Bail Organa, as played by Jimmy Smits in the much maligned prequels. There's just enough fan service to whet our appetites but not so much as not to distract from the main story. Likewise, keep your finger on the pause button for all of the visual callbacks and sight-gags sprinkled throughout.While it's true that the film has a built-in audience, it is definitely not for everyone. It has humor, but goes darker than ever before, which may be off-putting to some. However, if your love for the series begins and ends with the original core trilogy, this one's for you. Lean, mean and a feast for the senses, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is more than just a distraction or a place-holder until ""Episode VIII: The Last Jedi"" comes out later this year. It's so good, you'll almost forget there were other prequels."
" Rogue One puts the WOW-factor back in Star Wars
",-0.5574,0.9268,2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Just when you thought JJ Abrams buried Star Wars six feet underground, comes the glorious resurrection of the franchise in the form of Rogue One.This is the first Star Wars Movie since 1983 that had me say WOW! out loud many times throughout the film.From acting, to camera, to music and characters, everything in Rogue One felt genuinely impressive, fresh and exciting.Rogue One will make you laugh, make you cry, wow you and keep you on the edge of your seat for a wild 133 minute ride.With the bar set this high it will be interesting to see if the next Star Wars film will be able to keep up with Rogue One."
" Sheer joy except for two small details
",0.5859,0.9805,2017-04-08 00:00:00,9,"Gareth Edwards did everything right. Rogue one is better than most recent biddings; a lot in many ways. This being despite the fact Rogue One doesn't have the benefit of the old characters or the Falcon. To begin with it has a story fitting more into the original saga and not borrowing from other episodes. There are more than a few nods to ep 4-6 and in particular ep 4 since it's ending more or less where A new hope begins. Second, Gareth has continued Abrams ambition of making special effects look real. Of course they use cgi but he really wanted to shoot on location etc. The result is everything I liked about A new hope but way better. As for the characters they are pretty much spot on. Even more so compared to ""Force"". The actors in TFA did an goodt job but the ones here seem more real or logical. Now, the only two things I can think of are these: Removing the classical intro with the crawling text is a bit like removing the barrel shot from James Bond. It's really a small thing but I feel it´s essential. And why for Gods sake did they alter the masterpiece by John Williams? I mean REALLY?? Why not ad Metallica-ish guitars to Beethoven?? If it hadn't been for those two the movie would have been a 10/10."

Most of the designs will be familiar to aficionados; especially the battleships and fighters. And there is a nod to the original cantina scene, with an assortment of exotic aliens.The story itself feels rushed in the beginning of the film. The main character, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), is introduced and the drama is set on its path, but Felicity is an interesting character and she deserves more exposition. The basic story is predictable, filled with time-sensitive saves and the usual battle action.A droid character, K-2SO (Alan Tudyk in motion-capture gear), steals scenes with humor. He is my favorite part of the film. Donnie Chen plays Chirrut Imwe in a Blind Monk homage that is also a highlight.The film delivers plenty of action, which will satisfy many fans, but most of that action feels like scenes from previous episodes and fails to stir the emotions."

Some of the old set pieces are even re-used - attacking a bunker, for example.I love science fiction (although Star Wars is not science fiction - it's fiction without any science; cowboys and Indians in space) and sat through the first three movies but the interminable prequels were boring and, let's face it, only there to generate $ courtesy of fans. Apple manages to pull off a similar feat.So whatever anyone says, the fans are going to see this and probably love it. If you're on the fence you won't, simple as that.

" Brilliant movie from start to finish!!!

For the respect it has shown in creating the movie around a story that started nearly 40 years ago :) for anyone who grew up with Star Wars (now known as a new hope) would know the iconic beginning of the movie. Rogue one is created back to back with a new hope with a gap of nearly 40 years and end only minutes of the next movies beginning.Another thing I love about the Star Wars movies is the respect of creating the universe around the previous movies to detail and the continuity with characters and small/big details. The cast was superb and the cgi of Tarkin and Leila is amazing!! Can't wait to see the next Star Wars - the last Jedi and it's story line :)Well done Garth Edwards, cast/crew and team :)"
" Creative, entertaining, and worth seeing
",0.7717,0.9403,2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Rogue one creatively gives insight to many unanswered questions from the original trilogy. The plot was (in my opinion) perfectly conceived. True Star Wars fans will enjoy the incite it provides to the overall story and fans new to the Star Wars phenomenon will be absolutely blown away and hopefully hooked for life. The characters will undoubtedly be remembered as some of the best Star Wars has ever produced. I honestly have nothing negative to say about Rogue One. It stays true to the original Star Wars ideals as opposed to the criticisms that episodes 1, 2, and 3 that many believed strayed from the true heart of the franchise. Overall, it's a must see and I for one look forward to what's to come in the world George Lucas started...the world of Star Wars."
" A lifeless replica of what once was.
",0.0,0.0772,2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"If I were to re-purpose Biblical language for this review, I would say that Rogue One ""having a form of Star Wars, lacks the power thereof.""The movie makes every attempt to look like a Star Wars Movie, with its admittedly beautiful sets, gorgeous locations and elaborate costuming.Unfortunately, it fails to do what it needed to do - feel like a Star Wars movie.Rather than a fun and immersive cinematic blockbuster with interesting characters, Rogue One - in spite of all it's external trappings - feels like an empty shell of what we know and love.Not one character earns the viewer's investment. Not one action piece holds any gravity or weight. Not one note of the soundtrack is memorable. Character motivations are difficult to grasp; with main characters having personalities that change erratically.Perhaps the saddest thing was seeing terrible CGI flooding the film, a bitter reminder of where the prequels failed.Director Gareth Edwards proves once more that Godzilla was not a misstep on his part, it's his modus operandi - shallow characters, clunky exposition, and a handful of impressive shots that make for a trailer good enough to lure fans into a theater."
" Very Good
",0.4927,-0.8725,2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"The Empire takes scientist Galen (Mads Mikkelesn) back to work on the Death Star, a weapon that will destroy planets. Jyn (Felicity Jones) is raised by Saw Gemera (Forest Whitaker) and when she comes of age she knows how to defeat the Death Star as she sees her father, Galen, in a hologram and he tells her he put a loophole in the Death Star Plans that will destroy the deadly weapon so others will know how to defeat it. Jyn joins the Rebel Forces now known as Rogue One to find her father, Galen, and to get the plans and transmit them to the rebel forces. This is a prequel and we know this because we see Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), C3PO, R2D2 and at the very end: Princess Leia (Ingvild Deila, but the voice of Carrie Fisher) The CGI cinematography is simply incredible and just to watch these scenes is worth the viewing with the sound off. Kudos. The music plays all throughout the movie and is very good.Captain Andor (Diego Luna) is the supposed love-interest for Jyn, but nothing happens between them until the very end when they embrace. Felicity Jones as Jyn does an incredible job and she is very pretty too. HA!Comic relief was very good with the robot K-2S0 (voice of Alan Tudyk) and he was given some spot-on lines. For example: when Jyn shoots a similar looking robot, the real K-2SO tells her, ""You knew that wasn't me, right?"" HA!Most of the movie, of course, is all about CGI battles and it could put one into La La land, but they are exceptional and there is no denying that. Kudos. Notables: Jimmy Smits in a very small role as Bail Organa, a Senator with the Rebellion; Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera and we see him again during the last big battle; and Ben Mendelsohn as Director Krennic, the Empire's chief engineer. What I didn't understand was this: why didn't the rebels go after the Death Star Weapon, but only went after the Plans for it. I would have thought they would have gone after both.

" Like 1995's Judge Dredd but much worse
",-0.5267,-0.5742,2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,"This movie reminded me a lot of Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd from 1995 except it is way worse. Judge Dredd was a good bad movie that at least had some fun moments. Rogue One is just drab and boring.They even managed to make Darth Vader boring. When Darth finally appears, he looks small and his voice seems off.None of the actors had any charm or charisma. The only one with any kind of personality was the robot. The writing and dialogue were just stupid. The filmmakers were clearly more concerned with forcing a diverse cast on us than making a good movie.This movie was so lame and boring that I could barely finish it."
" Best Film Of All Time
",0.6369,-0.9751,2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"At this point, pretty much everyone that has been planning to see the new Star Wars story in theaters has already watched it. Perhaps there might be some out there that feel that an eighth movie in any franchise isn't worth seeing, and maybe some out there saw it, but didn't understand how much effort, love, and time went into each second of the movie. I will now recollect every right move that the crew over at Disney did in order to make a movie impossible to hate, without spoiling it of course.There is a little known rule in the movie industry called the Bechdel test, which is put in place as more of a guideline than anything for gender diversity in the media. What entails inside it are three vague rules making one vague sentence: at least two female characters that discuss with each other something other than the opposite gender. The test doesn't specifically state how long those characters have to be in the movie or if their talking plays a prominent role in the story, making it confusing as whether or not Rogue One correctly passes this test.There is a scene where the actress of Mon Mothma from the prequels (Genevieve O'Reilly) speaks to Jyn Erso about what her mission is. That scene is probably what some would think to be not enough for Star Wars to pass the test. However, I propose that Rogue One correctly allowed gender diversity without having to pass that dumb test. If Disney decided to use exactly two main female characters, then they would be pandering to a suggested rule more than anything. They would be following a rule that they don't legally need in their movie. If Disney had three female characters, that would be too much woman at once for a saga like Star Wars, which may lead to people thinking that Disney is attempting to be too equal in gender roles. Whether or not Disney theoretically did that is only guessing. In short, by having only a single female character that is also the main protagonist with no relationship, even implied with any man in the squad she's in was the best choice to go, and possibly the only correct choice.Multiple interviews with the creators and cast talk about how this Star Wars film is not like the other ones, where there's no optimistic Jedi such as Luke Skywalker or any members of Rouge One who are even close to having the cunning accuracy of Han Solo. Some come close to being like them, but in truth, they aren't. This was the first Star Wars movie when you felt that at any point one of the heroes could die just from not ducking under a blaster bolt. Before this, all of the deaths in Star Wars were implied before they happened or mentioned years later, with the entirety of the Jedi Order falling to Order 66 mentioned in A New Hope. In the new movie, not a single thing is mentioned about the squad besides that the Death Star blueprints were transmitted, beamed to the Tantive IV, the ship that R2 and Threepio are on at the beginning of the first Star Wars released to the public. This led to many speculations as to why these characters were never mentioned again. Maybe they became the Knights of Ren in Episode VII, maybe they left the rebellion afterwards, or maybe they died in action, or all of the above?All questions about who are these characters are and what happens to them are answered throughout the movie, leading to an ending that is even more memorable now only months after we first saw it, for obvious reasons I won't spoil. In my opinion, it is the best story."
" This is how The Force Awakens should've been made
",0.0,0.9908,2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Surprisingly solid and lively blockbuster filled with everything I expected from the Star Wars sequel The Force Awakens - a bit of adventure, a bit of laughs, a bit of tears, a bit of tension and tons of action. The picture is very pleasing to the eye - new interesting ships, new beautiful planets and new interesting creatures. The story itself is pretty straightforward as all we see is actually the Episode 4 opening crawl made into a movie, so nothing new in general but the way it goes on screen tells us: they've made an effort. And when somebody makes an effort it always shows. Even the secondary characters have their own small story. Even the smallest backstreet in some alien town is populated with life. Battle scenes are epic. I mean, epic. Probably, the most beautiful space battle in all 8 movies (so far) and the most engaging ground battle ever. It's literally a war movie in space. So, it's Star Wars!There are hundreds of carefully placed cross-references to other SW movies, books, animated series etc. which is undoubtedly entertaining for SW lovers but you can try to watch this as a standalone movie (though you probably won't understand a half of what's going on on the screen). CGI Tarkin and Leia are... er... promising. There's definitely more 'magic' than 'light' in ILM nowadays but we are still 'almost there' I think. Anyway, digital characters are surprisingly convincing, not overdone and really fit in the picture. Frankly, I expected worse.The only drawback is, sadly, the music - inexpressive and somewhat bland, it shines only when some classic SW themes come through. Yes I know Michael Giacchino had one month only to make the whole score but who cares, it's not mentioned in the credits. The bottom line: go watch it, it's the best Star Wars made without Lucas (so far)"

Sadly Ep 7 the force awakens lost that look and feel.I did not think it could get worse. Rogue One is even worse.The acting was mediocre at best. Half the time the musical score was terrible and at times it was starwarish but not enough.The worst character by far was the imperial Droid K2SO. In the entire STAR WARS universe there has never been a droid that did not act droid like until now, very poorly done Disney! This movie is mindless fluff, but does have lots of action and battle scenes and should appeal to children and the mindless tween crowd. If you forget this was supposed to be star wars it can be entertaining.Star Wars fans especially those who sat a theater in the seventies will be horrified by what has become of the Star Wars universe and may find it a disappointment.In sort if you loved The Force Awakens you'll love this, If you hated ep7 this one is the worst Star Wars yet.I would not waste money on the DVD or BLYERAY it will be on TV Soon."

While it was cool to see some old Star Wars outfits/ships and the robot Alan Tudyk plays was well done I just thought it was a poorly written/acted flick that had amazing potential. 6.5/10 for me."

Maybe I'm growing old, but watching Rogue One felt so cheesy, and unconvincingly boring. The acting, was sub standard. The aliens looked like total retards, and were used more for props than being part of the story. Come on Star Wars what kind of alien is it if it looks like a cartoon fish? Anayways, I was not impressed."
" A Rich, Stargazing Concept with Serious Problems
",0.1531,0.9591,2017-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Feels like I wanted to like this more than I actually did. Behind the dazzling effects work, the colorful character designs and the back-bending efforts to make everything feel at home beside the beloved original Star Wars, the story itself has deep-seated problems. Despite a very long, convoluted setup, most of the cast feels deeply underdeveloped and the plot comes across as overly simplistic and predictable. Even moreso than one might expect from a direct prequel to a film most of the target audience has watched dozens of times. The injection of late rewrites are obvious, too, as the third act flows far more smoothly than the preceding hour-plus. Most of the successful elements fall into the domain of the visual and the atmospheric. The constant attention to detail is impressive, going to great lengths to establish vital credibility, and I was amazed by the controversial, convincing CG stand in for the long-dead Peter Cushing. Another computer-generated character just before the credits isn't nearly as effective, but that's more of an Easter egg than an integral part of the story and I'll let it slide as such. The action scenes sing, particularly when they also twang the strings of nostalgia by dropping familiar forms into a new setting, and the grand climax, while somewhat saccharine-drenched, is nonetheless effective. A good demo-reel for the viability of the extended universe, but some day soon the sentimentality will lose its edge. Better get things tightened up before then."

",0.3346,0.2226,2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Disney made a complete pigs ear of their first attempt at Star Wars so it comes as a massive surprise to find they've done so much better with this prequel. Given the lead times from shooting to finished film it can't have been the public criticism of the first. I must therefore assume that someone at Disney knew they were selling rubbish and had the clout to correct it for the second effort. Well done that man / woman or committee.This is everything that the first one wasn't. The clichés were dropped, the tie in to the original films was (largely) dropped. They bothered to include a decent story without a pointless comic relief character like Finn. This is aimed squarely at an adult audience unlike Awakens with the baddies behaving like true baddies and not some 10 year old's idea of them.The only real fault was with the cgi in resurrecting actors from the grave or their youth. It's still obviously cgi and I'd rather see a look-a-like actor or actress doing the job than a cartoon character.I'll finish with a couple of points I'd like to whine over and they're both of a rather inconsequential nature.1. Why is storm trooper's armour not stick proof? 2. Why does Hollywood insist on an English accent (you know that really posh one that all British actors and actresses have to adopt to get work in Hollywood) that comes from just a small percentage of the accents we have?"
" Rogue One is flawed, but still a hell of a time
",-0.8126,0.9887,2017-04-03 00:00:00,6,"Despite having a number of problems and flaws, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a whole lot of fun and another solid entry into an already great franchise.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first anthology Star Wars movie and what many are calling ""Disney's experiment."" If this movie succeeds, Disney can feel confident in releasing additional anthology movies, if it's not then Disney will need to reset their course of action. With it's release well underway, Disney can feel confident in the direction they're going.Rogue One simply tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance stole the plans to the Death Star and sets up the plot for the Original Star Wars.Now, there is a lot to like about this movie. This is a very good looking and well shot movie. The cinematography is beautiful at times. It's very well directed and the action scenes are breathtaking at times. The third act alone is incredible and is a visual feast.The movie also does a very good job at connecting things to episode 4. If you are familiar enough with the episode 4 and the Star Wars franchise you can hear a line, or see something happen that connects to it and it's just very cool. It's like finding a piece to a puzzle and watching it fit in to the rest of the picture.The CGI (for the most part) is incredible. When the AT-AT Walkers in particular are jaw droppingly realistic. The space battles are exciting and thrilling and while Darth Vader doesn't have a huge role in the movie, he does have one incredible scene in the movie that may just be my favourite Darth Vader moment of all time.The performances are all universally pretty good. Felicity Jones is very good in the lead role. The movie mostly rides on her performance and she does a very good job. Mads Mikkelsen is also very good in his role, I wish he was in the movie just a little bit more, and Ben Mendelsohn is really good as the main villain of the movie.However, while the performances from the actors are all great, the characters are not. There is absolutely no attempt to develop any of the characters save Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso. She's the only one we ever learn anything about, she's the only character we are meant to care for, and she still is not developed well. Everyone else is just so poorly developed. Take Donnie Yen's character Chirrut Îmwe. All we're told is he is very in tune with the force, he's blind and he protects the temple. His friend Baze Malbus we learn even less about. He's really good with his gun That's it.That's what every single other character is like. We are told one or two character traits and that's it.The Force Awakens cared for its characters so much more (I'm only comparing because both movies had to introduce new characters.) We learn so much about Rey, who she is, why we should care f0r her. We learn about what she yearns and desires for, we see her discover things about herself. We learn so much about Finn. Who he was, and his desires. Kylo Ren is probably the most interesting new character in the Star Wars franchise. We see this villain, so conflicted within himself. We learn a little about his backstory, his struggle. These are characters. These are well developed characters.Rogue One just puts people on screen and is like, ""here are some people. They're good guys and they tell jokes so you should care about them."" It just doesn't work. The characters need to be developed otherwise there is just no emotional weight in the movie. Just think of how much more emotional weight could of been felt in the last act. Sure there was some emotion, but I just found myself not really caring what would happen to the characters and I didn't feel the emotion the movie wanted me to feel and that is because of how poorly the characters were developed.The other big issue with the movie are the two CGI characters. I don't want to spoil who the characters are, but there are two characters from the original movie that make appearances and well, they couldn't really use the actors now so they had to digitally recreate them. As stated, the CGI in the movie is mostly incredible. I did however have issue with the two CGI characters. The one at the end isn't a huge issue. The other one was very distracting and he is in the movie quite a bit. Every time he was on screen I just kept thinking, ""He looks like a video game. It just doesn't look real."" It was very distracting and he is in the movie a lot and it just pulled me out of the movie every time.The pacing of the movie is also uneven. Within the first 5 minutes or so the movie jumps around so much from planet to planet and it feels very choppy. The movie also has a lot of exposition. From characters introducing themselves and saying who they are and what they do, to the movie literally putting lower thirds up to tell you where you are, it just felt kind of lazy.Overall however, despite the flaws the movie has, Rogue One is a really good movie with incredible visuals, very good performances, and thrilling action sequences. Plus, it's Star Wars."
" By a distance, the finest Star Wars movie
",-0.5574,0.4341,2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Let's not lie about this, for all the colossal and justified popularity of the Star Wars franchise, they are not cinematically the greatest movies ever. They are fun, endearing, charming, captivating, but the acting could be better, the effects (for those who have seen the originals) are pretty weak and for his iconic imagery, Darth Vader is not the scariest or most intimidating movie villain ever.So there was definitely some room for a genuinely high quality story to join the Star Wars world, and while Force Awakens made a good fist of it, there is undeniable irony that a 'stand alone' adventure with character cameos is by some distance the strongest in the whole saga.Rogue One is the story of the team who managed, by hook or crook, to get the secret weakness plans for the Death Star back to the Alliance so Rogue Two and crew could destroy it. What exactly happened to that team I will not spoil by describing, because that is the story here in a nutshell.Felicity Jones, in her first headline act (unless you count the bizarre mess that was Inferno) is Jyn, daughter of the chief scientist behind the Death Star, separated from him at a young age and forced to live her life raised by an outsider before ending up alone. She finds her way into the Alliance and a plot to kill her father, and her attempts to save him lead to a domino effect which will eventually lead to the end of the Death Star.To say more would spoil the meat and guts; but it is safe to say this is an impeccably filmed, directed, produced and conceived stand alone adventure which gives avid fans some excellent and worthy back story while winning a few new ones thanks to the lack of need to have seen any of the other movies in the series.This is the first Star Wars to actually make you care about the characters - in that what happens to them truly matters - all the rest while enjoyable, simply didn't connect emotionally with the audience in the way this one does. Not in the opinion of yours truly anyway - and it's that control it exerts over its audience which makes it so strong - it respects its viewers, both seasoned fans and brand newbies, and produces a fine result for both.There is some character development, subtle though it may be in places, more obvious in others, aided by direction which gets the pacing dead on, and the cinematography is as good as any you'll see in any movie.The visual effects too are up to scratch, even certain cameos, and it really does neatly tie in with the rest of the franchise, with some fine humorous moments as well which don't feel as cheesy as the gags from the earlier efforts.Overall it's a rip roaring ride and hard to really fault on any level. Some characters ARE a bit wasted, which is a shame, but that's about the only thing wrong with it.Highly recommended."
" Worse than mindless action movies usually are
",-0.7184,-0.8086,2017-04-02 00:00:00,3,"The movie's title doesn't have the words ""Star"" and ""Wars"" in it. I call this honesty. Rogue One is non-canon filler taking place in the Star Wars universe. Pure milking basically. While this is not necessarily a bad idea as pure mindless action is often better than movies which try to be smart, but fail miserably - Rogue One's only redeeming quality is the CGI budget. There is nothing that stands out. Nothing positive I mean. The most memorable part for me is the hideously bad acting - which sadly was the main basis for any entertainment value this holds. Mads Mikkelsen is pretty much the only person who can act. The rest are fellows you would expect to do kids' reality TV for living. Somehow they end up here. The OST is horrible. It's basically Mad Max with 5% success ration. The movie is pure mindless action. There is no room left for character development, world or plot building - not even for pandering. Just space lasers making sounds in space because that's how science works and people hunting down a 3,5'' hdd because the future is so advanced and sci-fi. Truly one boring experience which doesn't have anything to offer. Except great amount of overused clichés, logic failures, character flaws and visually told scenes which execution you can't but laugh at."

With imposing villains, unscrupulous heroes and a straightforward story that enters some pretty dark territory, this stand-alone prequel to a New Hope is not only funnier than any previous Star Wars movie, but also the most captivating installment since the original trilogy.Unfortunately, however, this white sandy beach episode doesn't feature any bikini-clad Wookies.

" Could have been so much better
",0.4902,0.7859,2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"I have seldom been so disappointed by a Star Wars movie. I guess, in part, this is due to how much Rogue One had been hyped. Visually, it was everything you might expect from a Star Wars movie. The characters were somewhat better drawn than most films in this series. Where it really let down was in the editing. In my opinion, no movie better illustrates the impact that editing has on a film. The editing here was analogous to having the perfect flowers and a beautiful vase, and putting them together blooms down. It just bogged down in long stretches of tedium in between short bursts of brilliance. I would gladly watch it again, if it were cut down to 90 minutes by a talented editor."
" Bit disappointing, predictable and not as good as SW7
",-0.6814,0.7875,2017-04-01 00:00:00,5,"I found myself falling asleep during the movie (even though I was well rested) which is always a bad sign... Something failing to keep the interest.Won't say a lot, while the CGI was great, especially in the latter scenes where a lot is done is broad daylight, open spaces and against a marina background (always looks a lot more realistic when there are real-world backdrops), I thought the plot was very predictable with few surprises. Planet-busting Death Star, rebel scientist forced to build puts flaw in core reactor - spelled out in embarrassing clarity DOH! - must get plans for, and destroy...Jyn Erso seemed more like a little-girl-lost rather than a feisty Leia - was this deliberate? Stormtroopers always look impressive in their white armour, but how come they fall like tenpins at the first whiff of a blaster? Only at the end does Darth Vader show what Imperial forces should be capable of.I've long thought that the way battle is conducted in Star Wars movies is very WWII-ish, I don't see much evidence of advanced or futuristic methods, even though the machinery may be different.How is it that star-cruisers (or even stormtroopers) can't be protected by forcefields, as can an entire planet? Anyway, having one rammed and brought down in rather conventional way sure looks impressive - fans are happy and I guess in the end it's all about keeping the $$$ flowing in.Getting the Death Star plans out of that assembly looked suspiciously like 20th century storage technology dressed-up, complete with giant floppy/hard-disk... hmmm. Again it makes for the drama but is not very advanced.As I am a SF nut I will definitely keep this one in my collection if only for the great CGI scenes... too bad about the cerebral lack."
" Rogue 1 is a great example of a well told story
",0.7351,0.9966,2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I personally found this to be one of the better movies I've seen in a while.I thought the Force Awakens was fine, but I can't say I really got enthusiastic about any of the characters or the story.With Rogue One I thought it captured the magic of good story telling in which both the world and all the characters within it came alive so that you actually cared about what was happening.Whoever played Saw Gerrera and Orson Krennic they were fantastic characters that really boosted the background of the story and made the main character's struggle more compelling.I find the more I watch this movie, now that I have it, the more I like it while there's many other movies that have the opposite effect on me.The acting, dialogue, and the theme were all very tight and well done with little details like hand gestures and body language that made each conversation a little story in itself and so when you reach the climax you actually get excited about the action because your emotionally invested and care about the outcome.A really good example of classic fairy tale story telling with modern issues. Anyone who sees this movie and thought it should be more political or socially critical can go watch the Battle of Algiers instead, this is sci-fi fantasy.PS. I had a big argument with my friend as to which movie was better and he argued Force Awakens was better. I've seen Force Awakens 3 times and now I can't watch it without getting bored and turning it off while Rogue 1 is a movie I keep getting more and more fond of each time I see it. But I guess somehow there is something about Force Awakens people like which I don't understand."

",-0.296,0.7336,2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Just a few statements here: This is the first episode of Star Wars I truly enjoyed watching. Putting aside usual nonsense like sound in space and laser fire visibility and sounding, this is the first intelligently written and directed Star Wars episode. Now all of the story (I mean the whole saga) makes sense and is beautifully connected. The cast is very good, and so are their performances (which I cannot say for the rest of the movies). This is also the first Star Wars movie with almost nothing stolen from already told stories like John Carter and others. No J.J. Abrams (""damn the story! just shoot and kill and destroy! and do it fast!"") here and no G. Lucas (""I love fairy tales!""). Almost perfect. Too bad this was not filmed before (by the same team). And - yes: the ending of the movie is fantastic. Recommended with all my (old) heart."
" X wing vs Tie Fighter action at last
",0.1531,0.8566,2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"I am a huge SW fan so this was a great and fan movie for me to watch. As I watched it with my wife though, I had to explain A LOT of things, and it became apparent that it was a bit confusing to a non-SW fan. The plot is basic, flat, and practically an excuse for the magnificent battles after the first hour! The performances are very disappointing if you think of the wonderful actors in this film. I do not feel that the stars were really into Star Wars to be honest, so they failed to deliver their lines convincingly. Regardless!!! It's all about the battles! Excellently choreographed, fully satisfying, and exactly the thing I have been asking for since ROTJ.So, do not expect anything story wise, but the battles alone are worth watching this movie time and time and time again. 8/10 for the X Wing VS Tie Fighter Action !"
" Unbelievably overrated
",0.0,0.8259,2017-03-31 00:00:00,6,"We have reached a point in this franchise that the hard core fans of the franchise skew the rating very easily by giving so called ""automatic 10s"". This movie while not absolutely horrible, it has severe flaws that should not let it deserve more than a 6 with the most objective view possible. The characters are extremely uninteresting, cookie cutter and banal, the writing extremely predictable, the humor is embarrassingly bad and the tropes of the star wars franchise extremely forced, predictable and unfunny. Honestly, if anyone must watch all star wars there is,sure, watch it, it won't be a painful experience, but if you expect a masterpiece walk away as fast as you can. This movie is not the greatest of the year, not the greatest of the month and probably not of the week. The only redeeming quality is that it is watchable. You won't feel completely horrible about it. But don't be fooled, without the humongous budget this 6/10 would be a 5/10 at best."
" My 3rd favorite Star Wars film.
",-0.1531,0.7005,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I was 8 years old when ""Star Wars"" blew our minds in 1977. It was a work of genius and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was a worthy sequel. Finally we get a worthy Prequel. This is actually the first Star wars film since Empire that i consider to be a truly good film in its own right. I thought the performances were terrific particularly by the 2 leads Felicity Jones and Diego Luna. The supporting characters were memorable and i found myself actually worrying about these people. Also, it is action packed and as others have said, puts the War back in Star Wars. Darth also has some cool scenes and reminds us why you do not mess with Darth Vader! Great movie."

I really was excited for this, i mean everyone who loves the originals must have wondered what happened before that amazing opening to one of the greatest films ever!. But now i feel it was pointless to even make it. If you actually go back and watch New Hope after watching this film you would be confused. It doesn't even coincides with the original film(s)! Let me get this, so The whole rebellion attacks the whole planet and it got wiped because of that yet in New Hope Lord Vader says it was ""spies"" that took the plans? Honestly why? (i asked my self when they attacked the planet). Look i know they had to do a pre-equal to the originals but did it have to be so mediocre and so feminists!(yes you read it right). But one very positive about the film is the CGIs of the old characters, it was very brave thing to do and they did it well. I know nothing ever is going to be like the originals but this my least favorite star wars film for sure."
" Boring characters. Stilted acting. Boring plot. Beautiful scenery and special effects
",0.4588,0.922,2017-03-29 00:00:00,4,"I honestly don't understand how or why this movie is getting so much praise. Without getting into spoilers, there were so many parts of this movie that just did not make any sense. Jyn's attempt at a rousing speech was stilted and weird. She was an incredibly flat character. On that note, none of the characters were interesting or memorable. I don't even remember any of the other characters besides the robot...and you know your characters are bad when a robot is the most memorable one. Grand Moff Tarkin as a CGI character was a bad move. Any time he talked I couldn't get over how fake he looked, which was very distracting and it was hard to concentrate on what he was saying. The same could be said for another prominent character who was brought back with CGI.A lot of the attempts at instilling hope were just kind of cheesy and unconvincing. Contrary to what you see in this review, I am not at all a cynical person. I'm not typically the type of guy who tries to pick apart movies, either. But this one was so half-baked that I really felt the need to. I wanted to give a balanced review that contrasted the heaps of praise that this movie has received that I simply do not understand. Just for reference, I really liked The Force Awakens."

And a lot of winks to the original trilogy.Music: Michael Giacchino did an incredible work in creating new themes (you hear the ""essence"" of John Williams sometimes -The Imperial Theme for example-) and mixing them with the well-known and beloved original themes.

" Some of the true magic of STAR WARS is back!
",-0.4263,0.4163,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"I was a huge Star Wars fan. I say ""was"" cause I grew up with the original trilogy and the true magic that surrounded it. That same magic went out through the window when George Lucas decided to ""complete"" his saga with three additional films, The Phantom Menace, Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was very delighted to hear about this, but boy, was I in for a surprise when I saw The Phantom Menace. What was a saga for adults and children had now become a saga for children... under 10. I was really sad about the direction GL took with Star Wars and I felt how Star Wars no longer meant anything to me. I actually hate those movies. I started to dislike Star Wars from head to toe and I never watch any of the original movies anymore mainly because of GLs horrible CGI add ons. I don't know how GL manage to destroy his own masterpiece. I thought of him as a genius, but now I think it was more likely the staff around him that created the magic and GL was just lucky to have such a great film crew. Star Wars was a big part of my childhood fantasies and dreams, but they were now gone. Forever I thought. Until now, when Rogue One was released. I didn't dislike The Force Awakens but it still felt like a movie for kids. But Rogue One is not only a movie for kids. Its back were it belongs, and I actually felt the nostalgia return a bit. IT was a great movie and I salute the director, cause he manage to bring back some of the true magic!If I could erase I,II,II and the cartoon franchise that came with them, from movie history, I would in a heart beat. But I cant. I will never get back the entire true magic that once surrounded Star Wars, but Rogue One sure made me feel good again!...and Felicity Jones is great!And I can say I will watch Rogue One many times!"
" on par with the first two
",0.0,-0.9925,2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"this is by far the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back. why? because even though being very different from the main stream star wars narrative it pays homage to the one quality of the original star wars movies that we know and love them for i.e originality. this is more of a war movie than a sci fi. and granted there are some war movie clichés, never have I seen a more rooted in reality space wars film. you can really feel the WARS in star wars, even more than you can in the first two films dare I say. I can understand why die hard star wars fans don't like it, because it takes a leave from focusing too much on the defining traits introduced in the original movies e.g light saber fights and jedis using the force but the prequel trilogy was all about that and remember how it turned out. instead rogue one takes a different approach and focuses more on the struggles of the characters to survive in this brutal rule of the empire. unlike previous films, nothing is easy in this one. you can really feel the tension and danger and lives are lost in the struggles. plus I loved how the characters were very different from the original trio unlike those of the force awakens which should be a defining quality of the new characters since they are by definition NEW characters. also the character building of cassian was very good, in the start you see him murder someone because he will be a burden and I thought wow, what a jerk. but by the end you see him risking his life for jyn and nothing seems out of place"
" Over-hyped movie, would give it 6 star at best
",0.6369,0.9922,2017-03-28 00:00:00,6,"I consider myself an above average Star War fan (seen all the movies, knows all the main stories, played a lot of games, can call out most of the spaceship types and how many laser cannons they have etc.) but seriously I think this movie is mediocre at best. IMO SW movie values is held together by three aspects: quality of the space battle, quality of the jedi/sith battles, and special scenes or eye poppers; and recent SW movies' been poor in all three aspects. Maybe it's the fact that I'm not the die-hard type fan that I can keep my neutral judgment when it comes to movies from this franchise, but here are my two cents:To start with I know it's difficult to really make a SW movie; you gotta appeal to those who's been loving it since the 80s for episodes 4 to 6, and connect with episodes 1 to 3 which I believe has great effects and lightsaber choreography despite the stereotypical story. I don't really want to comment anything about the story anymore; not sure about others but I'm really sick of seeing the Death Star for the 6th time. The special effects + costumes felt carried over from episode 6 and 7 in a way that it maintained an 80s sci-fi look; but seriously nowadays we've seen too many neat tech effects that I find it kind of lame. I'm not really sure if I'm watching this movie in ultra high definition with dolby sound effects or from one of those old TV with antennas on top.Story-wise, given that the previous movies weren't that great in this aspect either, but they all have good effects for their time and some eye-popping scenes. For example, people loved Darth Maul in episode one with the dual light sabres and wowed when Yoda start dueling the Duku in Clone Wars and takes on Sidious in Revenge of the Sith. In Rogue One there were two scenes that could've been done very well or lengthened: one being stranded on a planet getting blasted by a death star and the other being Vader's killing spree. Both were almost non-existent and could've been done much better.What really got me to write this review is that movie ratings have really become untrustworthy nowadays. Too many credits (and Oscars) were given just because movies explore some minority issue(s) or have too large of a fan following, or very artsy and glamorous but with the most important factor ignored: and that is ENTERTAINMENT VALUE. Beyond all else critics and viewers really asking themselves, ""am I enjoying this movie?"", if not, don't give it kudos in the wrong area. I admit that great effects may add to this entertainment factor, but it really depends. For example I can't imagine the superhero and Sci-Fi movies being good without good effects, but then again you got old movies like Shawshank Redemption remaining at the top of the list despite whatever new comes out. I'm really shouting out to the industry and the movie makers to ""keep giving us quality movies"", and from that stand point, I can say that Rogue One isn't one of them."
" Could have been something really special !!!
",0.5952,0.9946,2017-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Another year, another Star Wars film. Only this time it's a spin off, a story relevant in the overall context of the Star Wars saga, but it still doesn't directly fall in line with the Skywalker stories in the episodic films. Let's first talk about what I liked:First of all, I have to somewhat admire Disney and Gareth Edwards for trying to do something different. 'Rogue One' certainly does feel different from the other Star Wars films, both visually and tonally. The word 'dark' gets thrown around quite a lot nowadays, but this film certainly does have a darker edge to it in comparison to the others in the series, although the seriousness does get undercut from time to time whenever some teddy bear-like or frog- like creature appears on screen with a blaster in it's hand, but to be fair that has more to do with the inherent juvenile nature of the Star Wars universe as a whole than this film in particular. Even though there is some fan service in it, at least 'Rogue One' doesn't completely play out like nostalgia porn(like Force Awakens did at times) for viewers who only want to watch scenes that overtly rekindle their memories of childhood and their experiences of watching Star Wars.Secondly, the concept of the specific story that this particular film explores is interesting. A film that shows the process by which the rebels somehow steal the Death Star plans and thereby adds a bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy, is actually a creative idea.Thirdly, the action scenes in 'Rogue One' are really well executed. Gareth Edwards showed in 'Godzilla' that he has a knack of not only staging huge magnanimous action brilliantly but also making them look weirdly grounded. In 'Rogue One', Edwards skillfully juxtaposes the aerial space battles and shots of Starfighters colliding in space, with the battles being fought on the ground and the beach where the camera remains at eye level, giving the viewer a proper perspective of the chaos in motion. Gareth Edwards' visual style and flair in terms of action sequences is truly on show here.Having mentioned what I liked, I'll move on to what I didn't and that's the characters. There is not a single character in the entire film that I can say I truly connected with emotionally. Whenever there is a film involving a group of individuals coming together to accomplish a mission, an argument can be made that it is difficult to give depth to each and every character. But I think an easy solution for that is to focus on one or two of them and give them depth and layers while the rest of the group gets certain individual personalities and characteristics to enrich the squad. In Seven Samurai Kurosawa focused on Mifune and Shimura's character and their interactions with the other members of the group with their own distinctive personalities made Seven Samurai have thematic depth and emotional resonance apart from the badassness of the action scenes. The two main characters of Gyn Urso and Cassian Andor are really bland and are not given any scene to add any personality to the film. Gareth Edwards found it very difficult to get good performances out of his actors in 'Godzilla'. It's pretty much the same here. Unlike the charismatic Daisy Ridley in 'Force Awakens', Felicity Jones and the rest of the cast are extremely unmemorable and nothing about them jumps out as something we can hold onto to like them. The lack of personality and the lack of attachment to the characters actually ended up diminishing the satisfaction I derived from the climactic action scenes even though they were expertly executed. The somewhat romantic entanglement that the film hints towards between Urso and Andor is extremely unearned.'Rogue One' is a solid action film, it has great visuals, great action scenes and it tries to do something different with the Star Wars franchise. However the lack of any sort of character depth and emotional density taints the film's overall effect. It could have been something great, but in the end it's just good, but in a dispensable way."
" Will surely please hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure
",0.6369,0.8509,2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Following their procurement of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise with it, it didn't take long for Disney to announce an all-new trilogy, continuing the legacy that was somewhat tarnished by George Lucas' terrible prequel trilogy beginning back in 1999. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, aka Episode VII, predictably made a ton of money in 2015, despite being a thinly-disguised re-hash of Episode IV with a few new characters thrown into the mix, and soon enough announcements were being made of spin-offs and origin stories aplenty. Many rolled their eyes at what appeared to be an easy money-spinner, but many more were excited to see this vast universe - which had been explored to no end in books, video games and comic- books - come to life on the big screen, and Gareth Edwards' Rogue One is by far the finest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. Set some time after The Revenge of the Sith but just before the events of A New Hope, the universe lives in terror as the Imperial Empire, led by the feared Darth Vader, seeks to crush the Rebellion and rule the galaxy. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is forced by Imperial weapons researcher Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) to complete his work on the Death Star, a device the size of a moon capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's young daughter escapes the Stormtroopers and is raised by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Years later and now a young woman, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is freed from a labour camp by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and is taken to Rebel leader Mon Mothma, who convinces her to help persuade her father to defect so they may learn more about the weapon he is building. Joined by a rag-tag gang of fighters and criminals, Jyn unwittingly finds herself at the centre of an impossible mission to steal plans to the Death Star, and playing her part in rescuing the universe from oppressive rule.Continuing the series' line of strong female leads after Carrie Fisher and Daisy Ridley, Jones' Jyn Erso stands out by not being a princess or a 'Chosen One' character, but a tough orphan without any stand-out skills other than sheer will and determination. She doesn't get any special treatment due to royal connections or suddenly start wielding the Force, but must shack up with an equally gruff and battered gang of unlikely heroes to stand any chance of survival. Her companions are as equally memorable and played by strong actors, without ever being defined for a unique attribute. With C-3PO off elsewhere, the comedy robot is K-2SO, a re-programmed Imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk who offers the movie such much- needed comic relief. There's also blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, who really looks like he's enjoying himself), his gun-wielding mercenary pal Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), and defected pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed).Any fans who adored the Easter eggs barely hidden in The Force Awakens will be pleased to know that there's no change here. As the timeline inevitably crosses over with A New Hope, many faces and events will be familiar. Even Peter Cushing is brought back via some impressive CGI work as Grand Moff Tarkin. Edwards ensures that these crowd-pleasing moments of nostalgia don't distract too much from the central plot, and he really goes all-out with the action scenes. Apparently, futuristic helmets were placed upon the heads of real soldiers in old war photographs by Edwards as an idea of how he felt the aesthetic of the battles should be. They pulled it off, as there's a real immediacy and grit to the fighting. and a clarity in the way it is captured. Donnie Yen going to town on some Imperial soldiers with a staff provided, for me at least, the film's highlight. While the film does move too fast for its own good on occasion, this is a thrilling experience, with characters far more interesting than those involving in the main story. It will surely delight hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure."

Galen refuses to work on the project. However his wife is killed in the ensuing argument and he is forcefully taken prisoner. Galen's daughter Jyn escapes and is taken to safety by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera(played by Oscar winning actor Forest Whitaker).Galen soon finishes the Death Star. Realizing the enormity of destruction this weapon would unleash upon the universe, he implements a flaw in the design of the Death Star whereby it would be destroyed by a single lazer blast at a specific point.Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook(Riz Ahmed) defects from the Empire, smuggling a holographic message from Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon Jedha. Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma(Genevieve O'Reilly), who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered by General Draven(Alistair Petrie), an Alliance military officer, to kill Galen rather than extract him.Watch the film to find out what happens next... This film has incredible action sequences you have to see to believe. The very latest of CGI imagery is used to bring the character of the late Peter Cushing, the Grand Moff Tarkin to life. Sound effects and background music score are spot on. Gareth Edwards who has worked on such movies as Monsters(2010) and Godzilla(2014) has managed to keep standards the visual brilliance of the Stars Wars saga alive.Verdict: Though The Empire Strikes Back is still my all-time favorite, this entry is my third choice, whereas Revenge Of The Sith is my second.More Space Movies To See: 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, 2010 The Year We Make Contact 1984, Alien 1979, The Black Hole 1979, Nightflyers 1987, The Last Starfighter (1984), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper."

Incredibly, it was not.This is the darkest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and unlike the other prequels it didn't feel like a kiddy flick. I was pleasantly surprised, and even impressed.Standout performers: 'Mad' Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Orly Schuchmacher, David Sobolov, and that black guyThe use of CGI to recreate Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia was absolutely jaw-dropping. I hope they do more of this in future.I rate Rogue Force One: A Star Wars Saga Story at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, at which works out as a flirtatiously pert 8/10 on IMDb."

The first hour is the most boring Star Wars movie hour ever made. My son was hyped for this cinema visit but fell a sleep before the movie finally picked up. Besides a short street fight there is almost no action in the first hour. After the first hour the movie is enjoyable, but my thoughts of leaving the cinema during the first hour is probably the only thing I will remember in ten years from now. The three first made Star Wars movies were a 9 or a 10 for me, this movie shouldn't been allowed to wear the Star Wars name."

It needed more comic relief, instead of endless dialogue that really didn't bring anything to the table. Donny Yen was a nice breath of fresh comic relief for a while,but sadly they didn't go with that.They went with more stupid dialogue instead What makes me most mad is,If that dumb broad had just fired the damn gun in the beginning, none of the people would have to die. I also found it a bit annoying that rebels can hatch out a feasible plan, even when they have the enemy right in front of them.They have like gazillion ships,yet they use nearly 10 minutes to decide to attack a star destroyer,that's been hoovering right in front of them the whole time. And why do they always attack them from above? They are clearly most vulnerable from underneath,yet they persist with the tactic that gets them shot.But what annoyed me the most,was all these damn dramatic pauses they gonna have all the time. When ever they stare in the face of danger,they always gonna freeze and stop for a moment.Instead of just taking action, or even better run."
" The Odd One
",-0.3182,0.8228,2017-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Although I would rate this episode very high in terms of visual effects, cinematography and production value, however, it was difficult for me to place the story on the time-line of the Star Wars series. As we were given to understand that it's a prequel to 2015 release ""The Force Awakens"" – I was expecting something like the background of characters like Rey – or a story that would extend into the near past of episode VII. However, the plot is completely disconnected with the latest episode and there is an entirely new set of characters whose relation with the existing set of characters, as we know in the Star Wars saga, is at best unclear and vague.If you are a fan of science fiction movies and love to watch fancy space ships, humanoids, droids, friendly alien species, interplanetary warfare, then you must watch this movie.However, as a Star Wars fan, you will find absolutely nothing that would qualify as any meaningful addition to the original tale. Nor there is anything you could expect to see in any subsequent episodes.After enchanting us with The Force Awakens, Disney has given us Rogue One as a filler, perhaps with a message: ""Hey, we're working very hard on the real one – The Last Jedi – till then, here's a Star Wars story you might like"""

I forced myself to sit through the entire movie and it was very challenging to do so. There were notable gaps in the plot, portions of the movie that really made no sense and/or followed no discernible logic, and the acting was horrid. Not nearly good enough to be a ""made for TV"" movie."
" Went in with low expectations. Was completely blown away.
",-0.2732,0.9951,2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"I actually had an IMDb account since 2010 but deleted it in anger when they did away with the message boards. However, I had never written a review before. I usually relied on the message boards to get a general feel for the movie as I found it hard to trust reviews. Since this is our only way now I read through the reviews before checking it out. I saw many either very good/ or very bad ratings. I tend to be pessimistic when it comes to Hollywood so I gave it a go with very low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I decided to remake an account to help others who may be needing average Joe opinions.You will know very few of the characters aside from a few that are brought in from both the originals 4-6 and the newer Eps 1-3. I won't give away who they are but you will have a few nostalgic moments and smile when you see them. Let me state that this movie was created with substance and storyline and forewent the graphical technology so prevalent in Hollywood over the last decade or so. For me this was a breath of fresh air and something that has been sorely missing for quite some time. The less is more was evident here. The story itself was very intricate. It wasn't shallow and built just as a popcorn flick just to make an easy buck. I felt as though they really put their hearts into creating something special for the audience. The acting was spectacular from all involved.Here's something else I was pleased with. I have really gotten sick of franchise films (or films in general) such as Marvel and the newer Star Wars movies relying on the cheesy nostalgia gimmicks, cheesy humor/ joke scenes, and general fear of making serious story lines that aren't basic formulaic packages they feel the entire family of all age groups can be brought to. Where's the serious story lines that really encapsulate the thinking person. Do any of you go into a Marvel movie and get swept away in imagination like you would in a really good book or do the cheap ""same old formula"" movies like Marvel and the new Star Wars movies make you groan with their attempts to win you over with their overkill of ""humor scenes"" and CGI? This Star Wars was made for those who fell in love with the original Star Wars 4-6. Who were swept up in the story and were in the movie for its entirety. This movie, in my opinion, stands up there in greatness with the original Star Wars trilogy unlike eps 1-3 and the newer Star Wars Ep. 7. It had that ""feel"" to it you only got from the original episodes 4-6.Sorry if I made this review a bit long, but I didn't know what to expect with the either extremely high and low ratings. I watch a ton of movies and shows and so I have pretty high standards. I want to see movies with substance and storyline and could care less if they have over the top graphics. I wrote this review for those of you out there like me that look for the same. I rated it 10 stars, but have a tendency to do that for any movie or show I really enjoy. I would imagine most who look for the things I do as mentioned above would rate this an 8-10 star though. We don't have the message boards anymore so hopefully more average joes like myself begin writing reviews. I'm not looking for ""professional critic"" like reviews, just honest opinions."
" Good but not great (Spoiler warning)
",-0.5409,-0.9952,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"People can say what they want about Ep 7 but I enjoyed it far more than Rogue One. While I liked the darker aspect of Rogue One, I wish we could have seen it before all the reshoots were forced (heh) upon it. Ep 7 was more fun and developed it's new characters better, and there was some great humor in the movie. By comparison, there is very little humor in Rogue One, save for the new droid (probably the most entertaining character to me).In terms of this movie, I personally didn't care about not seeing the opening crawl, but more jarring to me was the use of titles explaining the planets/locations, which I didn't need (it was never done in any previous Star Wars movies - why start now?). The music didn't feel like Star Wars at all (I understand it had to be composed rather quickly, but sorry - not my problem). There was very little use of the main themes and even when they did appear it was like ""hey, you know it's Star Wars - here's the music to say so"". The CG actors were OK but still not 100% convincing enough for me. They could have been referred to in the story and I would have been fine with that. At best they should have been shown from afar or as one of them is first shown in a window reflection and left it at that.In terms of new characters, I liked Jyn but the other lead actor with her had too thick of an accent to be that much in the foreground. His voice should have been dubbed, and his character was generally unlikable to begin with. It seemed like there may have been a subplot to show him turning around (character-wise) or at least being morally ambiguous, but the final cut makes it clear that any potential for this will never see the light of day. The other characters were all throwaways and was no point in getting attached to them. Watching them get killed off later on has basically zero emotional impact because of this. Also, there is no Han Solo type of character, and all the fun interplay between them (like in Empire Strikes Back) does not exist here whatsoever.I did like the rebels vs rebels idea, and the new Droid was fun without overdoing it. The new villain was good, though indirectly undermined by including two old characters along with him. One neat idea that did work was that you get to see the Death Star's weaponry being used and it's not perfect off the bat. There is little combat to be found for the first two thirds of the film, so the battle in the last part by far has the most action and felt the most ""Star Wars""-ish. However, the combat is all shot in that completely overused and overblown shaky cam style that is just revolting to watch at this point, and it felt completely out of place for a Star Wars movie.The scenes with Vader were the highlight of the film by far, as short lived as they were. I found his last scenes to be the most entertaining....And then the film basically just ends. A rip off if you ask me. There was a perfect opportunity to have him appear sooner, more often, or even just make him the main villain again - none of which happened sadly.Overall, it really didn't feel that much like Star Wars, but more like a war film disguised as Star Wars with just enough fan service to get by. I really didn't expect much, but there really was no point in this movie being made in the first place. In the long run, it serves no real purpose in the story line considering you will never see these characters ever again in any other movies. Personally, I'm getting tired of Hollywood feeling some need to explain backstories to characters or story events (stop doing it, we need some mystery in our lives), only to be done so in a completely lackluster way. That, combined with boring characters that ultimately serve no story purpose. Had this been a short film, or done in a short episodic format like the Clone Wars cartoon was years ago it would have worked far better.In the end, it's not a horrid film, but it will be the first Star Wars movie in 40 years that I will not buy a physical copy of. As a result, I have no faith in the upcoming Han Solo movie. Nice try Disney, but you better step it up if you intend to milk the Star Wars cow for all it's worth."
" Looks solid, but feels uninspired
",0.0772,-0.9558,2017-03-24 00:00:00,5,"Not a long time ago, in our very own galaxy, the filmmakers decided to create a prequel to Star Wars: A New Hope. And they really wanted to do it by the book: by putting in a list of recognizable actors, a plethora of characters and locations and tech, old and new, making the story emotional with the force of family bonds and the sense of duty. They even showed us a glimpse of Darth Vader as a cherry on top. Sounds cool, right?True, on the surface Rogue One looks very grand. But, as we have learned from the case of Death Star, even grand things may have very small flaws that ruin everything. And for Rogue One those flaws are characters and pacing.Indeed, with so much bound to happen and with only 133 minutes of running time, you must move quick to cram everything into the timeline. But for some reason Rogue One doesn't feel consistent in its density. At times it's painfully slow and almost boring, with people talking and arguing and debating some more. And at other times it flicks through characters and hops planets like a mad rabbit, causing a degree of ""what is this place/person again?"" frustration even in a prepared SW viewer, while outright alienating the freshmen (although the same freshmen could digest The Force Awakens just fine).Another stone pulling Rogue One down is the main characters, or rather the actors playing them. I don't mind Felicity Jones or Diego Luna at all, they are fine actors per se. But they are not fit for the action figures. Jones may deliver a sharp punch at times, but mostly she makes that sad puppy face - and you just quit buying into her fighter spirit. Same with Luna: no matter what he does, he looks awfully tired and overwhelmed, dragging our mood down with him.Maybe if we had characters as vivacious and fierce as Rey and Finn as protagonists, the whole story would feel different. But we have what we have, and despite all the graphic lushness, a number of nostalgia-inducing moments, characters twisted and conflicted inside, and actual space fights, Rogue One feels like one major drag, where everyone does something, but only the bad guys actually believe in their cause. The space fights are overly long and tediously repetitive, the graphic lushness mostly resorts to cold space or desolate deserts, and even the character twists and development, with an unexpected sense of common purpose and a timely remorse for the former wrongdoings, have a whiff of generic movie psychology. Two slightly redeeming points of this film are the blind monk, but even he gets annoying towards the end with his repetitive chanting and inconsistent potency, and the Ben Mendelsohn's character, who is a typical Mendelsohn's not quite good but not entirely evil guy. As a mirror character of Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux from The Force Awakens, he's done a much better job. Too bad it wasn't enough to salvage the whole enterprise.When The Force Awakens turned out to be a soft reboot instead of being an independent story, I was hoping that maybe it was for the best and that way the filmmakers would be able to expand on the original story and give us additional depth, the chance that was skipped back in the time of the original trilogy. Rogue One is definitely an attempt to fill the blanks and deliver some background. But so far it's more of a miss than a hit. So hopefully it will be a lesson learned for the SW film crew: that spin-offs require as much effort as the main story films. You were inspired enough to bring the Star Wars back to life - now use that inspiration again and put it to good use."

" Unnecessairy, but it builds up what TFA broke down
",-0.5719,-0.577,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"The original trilogy still stands its ground, while many fans may ask if the next trilogy was necessary. Storywise it was, in a saga that holds more than 3 movies can contain. TFA ruined that with a story that added nothing except disappointment, being a sequel that turned out to be a blatant remake, and thus an insult.Rogue One however, connected between the 1st and 2nd trilogy. It didn't have the annoying lead characters, the rushed story and the horrible acting that came with TFA. Rogue One almost stands on its own, while connecting some loose ends and introduces characters that are almost memorable, and certainly not bad or useless.And it succeeds in (re)introducing Darth Vader, in a way that Revenge of the Sith couldn't. Not a classic, but a respectable effort and a decent follow-up that might ease the pain after TFA."
" The power that Rogue One dealing with...is awesome
",0.6249,0.9768,2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,"One of the best prequels of Star Wars is here, I love this movie, it's so good, Gareth Edwards you have delivered a great film. Let's go throw the positives: Expanding the galaxy, I like all the new planets, characters, creatures, droids and more, Rogue One builds on the Star Wars universe. The music, its not John Williams but the composer for Rogue One did a good job, only one problem, the songs he did I remember that well but John Williams songs I can remember, even non Star Wars songs, I don't like how the songs change some of the John Williams songs. Original Characters, I like how they included characters from the original trilogy like: Mon Mothma, Princess Leia, Tarkin, Red Leader, Gold Leader, The two guys that would to kill Luke in A New Hope, That Old Rebel Captain or General, C3PO and R2 D2 and most of all...Darth Vader. The Ending, who didn't like Darth Vader killing rebels, cutting them in half and choking them to death, it is the best scene of Darth Vader and Rogue One. Let's go throw negatives: Less Darth Vader, I really would Darth Vader to be in the film longer, even if it a minute longer, I would love it, I think they should done less Tarkin and More Vader. Deaths, I like the idea of everyone dying but I think that one or two people should have survived. Like K2 and Baze. The battles, okay just to let you know I love the battles but the final battle in Rogue One didn't fill right, they keep cutting to an other scene, one point it Jyn and Cassian and the next it's X wing and then it's Baze and then K2 and then......, there is too much going on, too many stories in the battle. The last negative: Darth Vader's joke, I don't think I have to explain this one. So there my review of Rogue One, it was awesome, I recommend this film."
" The Star Wars Movie Adult Fans Have Been Waiting For
",-0.5574,-0.9734,2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One: easily the most adult of ALL Star Wars movies. To some, saying ""adult"" would mean ""boring"", ""unexciting"" or ""lifeless"". ""Rogue One"" is none of those adjectives but it's fair to say it is the most ""kid unfriendly"" of all the Star Wars movies. Director Gareth Edwards made it his quest to make a Star Wars movie for the middle aged fans, the ones who were, 8, 9, 10 or even 15 years old when they first got introduced to George Lucas' space opera. Yes, I'm one of those fans. It's unavoidable comparing this movie with the prequels. While the prequels had their charm (and were made by the CREATOR himself, Mr. Lucas), it wasn't really what I was expecting. I don't hate them at all, but I don't like them as much as the originals (I do think however, ""Revenge Of The Sith"" is superior to ""Return Of The Jedi""). Gareth Edwards completely understood that there was a huge need for a more ""serious"" Star Wars movie. ""The Force Awakens"" was a move in the right direction, despite what the unfaithful might think or say. ""Force Awakens"" had a perfect balance of serious, dramatic parts with more lighthearted fare (without ever falling into Jar Jar or ""ani"" territory). With ""Rogue One"", Gareth Edwards went all out to make a grim, bleak looking movie. Certain scenes reminded me of ""Bladerunner"" and ""Alien"", two masterpieces of adult science fiction. We get to feel the rough edges of the rebellion, that it's not all peachy and good and that sometimes violent decisions must be made for the sake of the cause. Reviewers that have also mentioned similarities to ""Saving Private Ryan"" are also right. The fights are violent, the storm troopers are scarier (something that JJ Abrams got positively right in ""The Force Awakens""), the rebels have their defects. It's not all ""good"" or ""bad"", there are grays, there's a middle ground.What we basically have with ""Rogue One"" is a prequel. The most ""prequels"" of the prequels, if there's an adjective to describe Gareth Edwards work here. The movie truly ends with the beginning of ""A New Hope"". We finally know how the rebels ""stole"" the plans to the Death Star: a lot of casualties, a lot of deaths, a lot of sacrifice. ""Rogue One"" was the REAL suicide squad. Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor and their band of mercenaries are heroes as much as Han Solo, Leia Organa or Luke Skywalker. While the latter three lived to celebrate the destruction of the Death Star, I wonder how many of the rebels know the sacrifice that went into stealing the plans. The acting, the pacing, the effects: everything was brilliant about ""Rogue One"". It was a daring project that could've backfired but it did not. Yes, I too missed the intro scroll with the triumphant Star Wars theme playing loud in the background. Yes, I missed the familiar themes of John Williams. Composer Michael Giaccino had one hell of a task but he pulled it of. The main prevalent musical motif in ""Rogue One"" (could be ""Jyn Erso's"" theme) is similar to ""Rey's Theme"" in ""The Force Awakens"". It could be a friendly nod from Giaccino to Williams. Only a couple of Williams' classic cues were used: The Imperial March, the Imperial theme from Star Wars, the Force theme and of course, the end credits have a good portion of classic Star Wars music, but almost 90% of the score is brand new music. It had to be done and Giaccino was the right choice.I have nothing but praises for ""Rogue One"". If you were expecting something like ""The Phantom Menace"", this movie is NOT for you, I'm sorry to say. For me, ""Rogue One"" hit all the right buttons. It was the Star Wars movie I was waiting for."

But like any movie, there's always room for improvement and the only issue I really had with it is Donnie Yen's character. The writing for him was not very good at all and it felt almost like they couldn't figure out what to do with his role to make it more relevant to the story. His opening fight scene was one of the best I've seen in any movie and it was downhill from there. Mr. Yen deserved better in the writing for his part in my opinion. Repeating the same line over and over quickly became annoying and there was so much more that could have been said and done with his ability as an actor. He clearly had a grasp of the ""force"" and I was expecting him to be some kind of spiritual mentor even if he wasn't ""officially"" classified as a Jedi and perhaps not central to the plot. The rest of the cast did very well and each role was clearly established.As for the story, the only other improvement that I would have expected but wasn't entirely necessary was for more on the back- story of Forest Whittaker's character.Overall, this movie is a 9 out of 10 for me and will definitely be in my collection when the Blu-ray comes out!!"

Other than it being an open and blatant cash-in attempt by Disney to hoover more money from me and you it has a girl who performs feats of athleticism that are almost jedi like, a Chinese guy who never gets hit with a bullet and performs martial arts better than jedi, a villain whose only role is to give a boring monologue and a forcefield that can be overcome through some creative domino play.Guys, do something productive with your lives.

" Dull Wars
",-0.743,0.2999,2017-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Some films can make you feel interested in the main characters within minutes. Rogue One to me is just another of those overly long movies that fails to create any form of empathy with anyone, even at more than 120 minutes. If a filmmaker doesn't care about the characters he is creating, then how could I as a viewer.The beginning was promising, with Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn having an interesting showdown in a wide poetic landscape. But the longer the film went on, the more I felt that there must be a book titled ""How to make a Star Wars film"", and some studio executives got their hands on it. That said, the film is very well produced and superficially looks like a Star Wars epic in every way. But the bland acting (Diego Luna especially) and the constructed story line put me in a rather dull mood. Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic was one of the few interesting appearances. There were some good attempts in showing the moral ambiguity of the rebellion, which had some potential to suck me into the story. Unfortunately the fight scenes in the holy city made the Storm Troopers look pretty silly, almost comedic, and took away any sense of menace. I do think there is an interesting dramatic story at the heart of it, but somehow after decades of film making, Disney seems to have forgotten how to build a gripping tension. When certain decisive moments in the film occurred, like the arrival of the rebel fleet, I just didn't care. For me, this is a product leeching off the sentimental memories people have towards the original films, me included. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone above the age of 11, and I surely won't watch it again.Finally, I found Leia's CGI face pretty horrible, but the film had already lost me at that point, so I wasn't as shocked as I should have been."

I wish I had been taking notes during the movie so I would have more to say on the subject but the one that bugged me the most is ""THE MASTER SWITCH"". Okay guys, we need to be able to beam up the Death Star Plans but first the shield gate must be destroyed and we need to find the MASTER SWITCH. Don't know what it looks like and have no idea of where it is but get out there and find it. Somehow a battle cruiser was disabled quite quickly - why couldn't that have been done in subsequent movie battles? - and pushed into the gate. Okay that's accomplished.Then magically the MASTER SWITCH appears on a console in the middle of the sand box fight. I'm surprised that there wasn't a sign on it saying MASTER SWITCH.

In fact, if they could erase the other 4 star wars movie and just leave this one and the original 3 and that would be perfect. Rogue One is a great movie, no doubt about it. The only thing I didn't really like is the choice to use Diego Luna as one of the main characters. I've never seen him before but I wasn't impressed. He seemed like a one-dimensional character throughout the whole movie and was not up to the standard of everybody else in my opinion. He just had this annoying grumpy face in every scene and weird accent which was a bit annoying and monotone. But apart from that, I'm very happy that we finally get to see a great star wars movie after all these years. Well done to everybody, especially the director. Bravo."

Imperial shuttles are apparently all a special different snowflake, that suddenly becomes uniform when you get back to the original trilogy.Shields make no sense, if you can shield a planet from the planet, why the heck cant you shield the death-star from the death-star? Also, in the movie the ""gate"" blocked the shield by dropping blocks that blocked it therefor creating the opening. Can someone explain to me how destroying the gate somehow creates an opening?Everyone dies, the only good part. I lied, the death star firing at lowered power is also pretty much the bomb.Lighting round: AT-AT's appear out of nowhere, how many ground troops fit in this one shuttle, the rebels can run faster (while staying unseen) then a transportation system can get the main characters to the place, crystal sub plot that is quite literally a waste of time, dumb power struggle between uncanny valley and generic boss villain, do they follow any rules with the colored squares that obviously denote rank, What's with the super AI bot you never see in any other movie?It's a pile of steaming bantha excrement, but it's warm, and you get to watch the death-star be awesome."

However the great cinematography, interesting locations, and classic Star Wars aesthetic are merely a veneer, a carefully crafted charade that hide the superficiality underneath.The film is not devoid of value. The action sequences are good and certain elements of the story are interesting.Possibly its best but least explored dynamic is the class divisions within the Rebellion itself. At the top are upper-class elites who are timid about getting their hands dirty and on the other side are hardened extremists like Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) who is an inverted Darth Vader, kept alive by a mechanical apparatus.However, despite a few genuinely fun moments, the film does not stand up to hard scrutiny upon second viewing, nor does it actually add anything of significance to the franchise.The dialogue is clunky and repetitive.The characters are two dimensional and none are really given enough time to develop.The plot is generic and doesn't take any stylistic risks, sticking to a very familiar Star Wars structure.The pacing is too fast, constantly moving from location to location.The music lacks the subtlety, sophistication, and acoustic quality, of A New Hope's.The cameos are buoyed by unconvincing performances that, for a film so obsessed with banking on nostalgia, should have looked and sounded exactly as they do in the following film.Rogue One could have been an interesting experiment into fusing different genres into the Star Wars franchise, but it ended up as a generic filler film that fills a gap in the narrative no one needed to have filled.As a mindless action film that puts you in the space of the Star Wars Universe it's effective, but as a story that adds any value to the Star Wars lore it isn't."

Cinematography is astounding. But after a while, the pretty images don't make up for some hollow characters and a tired old story line.There is also some nice use of real props and prosthetic costumes which blend well with the CGI.Again, the craftsmanship is great, they just needed some more of it in the script. But it's Disney right? They know just the right amount to get away with.However, there is some god awful CGI as well, when they digitally recreate dead actors. It's very unsettling. I'll have nightmares from it now.The characters have no chemistry. They're just plot devices. No character bonding, no quiet moments between action scenes. All the lovable qualities of the original characters are not apparent.I guess it's a serious Star Wars movie, but does that make it Star Wars?

I had high hopes that this spin off would leave the franchise feeling grounded again and make a little more sense than the last flick... oh boy did it NOT.While some of the visuals are certainly cool, overall the film is gray and bland, much like the story it aims to tell. The plot couldn't go wrong... rebel spies stealing plans to the Death Star certainly is a story worth a feature length motion picture, definitely a story I wanted to see fleshed out... but now that I've seen it, I changed my mind! The musical score is loud, obnoxious, and distracting. The CGI is pretty unconvincing. The special effects range from ""awesome"" to ""please stop"". The movie flows like paint dries. There are some interesting ideas in there, but anything remotely so is executed with the competency of a 12 year old boy's fan fiction. The acting is all around hammy and cringe-worthy with the exceptions of Papa Erso and the charming Imperial droid that most certainly deserved a better movie and script to work with, the lovable K-2SO.Not a single one of the characters has a clear motivation. I was constantly left wondering, what does this person want? What little information I received came through vague theatrical self-important dialogue that didn't seem to reveal anything substantial as much as provide loose context for why characters were going from point A to B. The bad guy wanted to stop the rebellion, and the protagonist wanted to find her father... but beyond that, I was never quite sure why anything was happening other than, ""save the rebellion!"" and ""rebel scum!"" for the sake of violence.The plot is a vehicle for shaky cam style action and haphazard fan service... much of the fan service creating all new plot holes to make up for the non-existent plot hole this movie promised to fix. At least C-3PO being owned by Uncle Owen in Episode II can be explained by ""oh, he just forgot... racism against droids or whatever."" The plot holes here are just baffling... leaving me wondering if whoever came up with this ever actually saw the original 1977 film, or if anyone involved had half a brain to question the blatant contradictions to the already shaky continuity. Maybe nobody really cared. Gotta get dat money.This movie is boring at best, and utterly infuriating at worst. There's one insanely awesome scene between this heap and a 0 rating. The Force Awakens stumbled with its derivative revival of the franchise. But this movie completely ruined everything it touches. If you like Star Wars references, puns, shaky cam action scenes, archetype characters cut outs, the Empire's fashion sense, or religious chanting, this is the movie for you. Don't expect the rich in depth story telling Star Wars is known for, and don't expect to see the deep reflection of war and sacrifice the delusional fans will insist this is... don't listen to them!

What most annoys me is the fact that the Stormtroopers most of the time just produce hot air by their shooting, their armor is good for nothing (even with a stick you can knock them out - well, I know even the little teddybears in Episode VI did it with stone axes) and the inconsistencies in the movie(s) are countless - a planet-sized shield breaks down because two star destroyers hit it... Also, they still use discs for storing data :D And a little group of ground troops of the rebels engage a whole imperial garrison - I mean common, at least an outflanking maneuver should be included in the training of the storm troops if they already cut down the target exercises and spend money on fake armor. Some more examples!?1. If the building of the Death Star is such a secret operation why use human pilots for transporting crystals and other stuff. Aren't there droids in the universe (or maybe just spaceships with an autopilot-system!?)2. Why the stormtroopers transported the crystals with the tank through the (hostile, rebel-infested) city instead of using air transportation as vertical takeoff is standard there should be enough space for that kind of maneuver or you just make SPACE.3. Why killing the engineers!? If the Deathstar is flawed I would use that team to find the weakness. And really 6 engineers!? I guess you would need for whatever system you are planning and engineering for a project big as the Deathstar dozens if not hundreds of engineers. Even the toilet/waste system for the Deathstar would be a great challenge to manage.4. Last but not least why using Stormtroopers at all and not just Droids (ofc not those dumb ones of Episode I to III)!? I mean K-2SO is a droid specialized on tactical analyzing and he alone killed over a dozen stormtroopers - how many a killer droid programmed and equipped just for one purpose: for killing would have finished off!? Hundreds!?I just listed those as a few examples because I could go on and on and on - the mistakes and logic-bending issues are countless (no counter-espionage, the rebels can move and do whatever they want, the Imperial Army is always surprised, even bases with thousands of rebels are possible etc. pp.)Star Wars imo is highly overrated - if I compare this with classics like the first Alien movie or Blade Runner this is nothing more than storytelling on a level of John Wayne movies (his mediocre, mass output movies). Yes, the first 2 Star Wars movies were epic (the 3rd to a certain degree, I always hated the Ewoks-part) and I re- watched them countless times, but all the other movies and series were just disappointments. And as I watched the first trilogy I was of very young age and the (for that times) epic visuals may have clouded my judgment a little. Even Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe!) or the first movies/show of Battlestar Galactica are Noble Prize worthy masterpieces compared (storyline, construction of the respective ""worlds"").Don't get me wrong on a technical level Rouge One is superb, but the story and the ""world"" itself are at most mediocre and with every additional movie it shows more and more that there is not much substance to it - just compare it with the Star Trek universe (I am no Trekkie) and you see easy which one is a more coherent and interesting universe. Rouge One is better than The Force Awakens but still nowhere near to be a masterpiece. Final words: if my country would be ever threatened by such incompetent invaders like the imperial forces I would take my pocket knife and maybe a stick too and start a revolution and by tea time I would have defeated them - alone ;)"

Also i didn't like ""The Force Awakens"" which i gave a 4, and it's top 3 most rated review for that movie here on IMDb.So the way i saw it, failing director meets failing franchise, what can go wrong?. Well apparently, it went surprisingly well. This is in fact one of the best Star wars movies to this date, probably the third best only beaten by ""Empire Strikes back"" and ""A New Hope"". And wow, that was not what i expected at all.Where ""The Force Awakens"" leans too much on nostalgia and has very little fantasy and originality, this movie stands much better on it's own feet. And i criticized ""The Force Awakens"" for having yet another Death star in it, they do have that here as well. But in this movie it's different, as this is the direct prequel to the original Trilogy.This movie has surprisingly well made battle scenes, i just had to get that off my chest, it's made the right way. I feel i get to see what i need to see most of the time. The camera angles, the view of the battles and the pacing, is all well done. It feels like the director really knew what he was aiming for, not just throw in mindless explosions whenever they feel appropriate.Rogue One is a breath of fresh air. Not a masterpiece my any means, the movie has to much of the usual stuff to be called that. There are few surprises in the story. Except the ending, which was quite nice, i could not predict that one. :) Everything else is just as you expect. It's classic star wars, it has good acting (for the most part anyways), it has a good plot, it has great visuals, a flamboyant soundtrack, impressive spaceships, immense action scenes, awesome villains and some nice surprises.This movie could probably have been lifted up one more star if it dared to be a little more original. But hey, it's not a big deal, for many kids watching this movie, what they are seeing is completely original and never been done before.7/10 - Quite Good"
" Not bad but very far away from being great
",0.8213,-0.8827,2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"This so called Star Wars movie is definitely not bad, it is an OK story telling, filled with good actors. Compared to Star Wars - The Force Awakens (Star Wars - The Force falls in to a deep sleep and may never wake up again), which is on top of my most worst movies I ever had to watch in my entire life list, followed by the 2015 Fanatic 4 movie, it took me a week to watch that unbearable two hour nonsense of a movie, directed by Jar Jar Abrams, Star Wars - Rogue One is quiet entertaining. This movie suffers a lot from the fast cuts. In one scene you are on this planet and on the next scene you are on an other one. And this happens about 10 time or so. That is really hard to handle. The characters on this movie are a little bit flat too, even they are played by great actors. So over all this movie is watchable. But for me, Star Wars what is used to be, do not exist anymore. The magic is gone, only the commercial part has been left."

" The prequel Star wars deserved
",-0.5574,-0.6597,2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Watching 'Rogue One', it felt like seeing one of the original trilogy. The aesthetics and story line where as such to make it feel like i was watching 'A New Hope' or 'The Empire Strikes Back' again. I also have to say that after seeing 'Rogue One', I will never be able to watch the beginning of 'A New Hope' the same ever again, knowing the story behind the plans. Now, to address the controversial animation of Peter Crushing, I do not see what is wrong with it. Using CGI to bring back to life a deceased actor, if anything, says that he is irreplaceable, there is no disrespect for him. So, what I have to say for 'Rogue One' is that it defiantly deserves its place in Star Wars and in 20 years time should be thought of as one of their greats."
" Excellent Movie
",0.5719,0.886,2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I think my 4th favorite Star Wars movie behind the original trilogy (much better than The Force Awakens). If this was a stand alone SciFi movie and I never saw any other Star Wars movies I think it would be one of my favorites of all time. I can count on one hand how many movies I've gone to see at the theater more than once and I saw this one 3 times. It did an excellent job of tying in Episodes III and IV. Cinematography, acting, writing, special effects were all spot on."
" Perfect Star Wars movie finally
",0.0258,0.8762,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One is my kind of sequel to saga I have always wanted to see. If you liked Force Awakens you will love Rogue One. Movie have many hints to old Star Wars movies, especially to A New Hope. Many don't like the way they brought back some of the old characters, but to me it was OK. If somebody had any questions how Disney will treat Star Wars and can they keep saga alive after this movie movie I think there is no any questions about it. Disney is a perfect home for Star Wars and I hope we will see many Star Wars movies in the future. In Rogue One makers had free hands to handle the characters because there is no need to make sequel for it. You could think that story is dull, because you already know the ending. Despite that movie is full of surprises and script is clever. Without a doubt Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars movies.Star Wars movies has always been my favorite movies since 1977 first movie. It was a good choice to sell Star Wars to Disney after not so good episodes 1 to 3. This way we Star Wars fans get a chance to enjoy many more Star Wars movies in the future. Rogue One is an excellent continuum to Star Wars saga."

First of all, these characters are bland and uninteresting. The film lacks pacing in the first and second acts, and seems to be moving through mud until the ending.

They put it into two hours, when the backstory is simple and could only take an hour, maybe an hour and a half.The movie is nice though. If you were looking for special effects, you have possibly one of the best movies for that.I'd give it a 7/10, clearly lacking, but still enjoyable."
" Not a Star Wars movie and just bad
",-0.1471,-0.9147,2017-02-28 00:00:00,5,"Rogue One isn't a terrible movie, but in my opinion it is bad. It has very few characters which I cared to learn more about after their initial introduction and in the end, I cared about nobody's death. The pace of the movie was far too quick with an extremely saturated cast of characters. The first 15 minutes I literally laughed out loud as a new planet was introduced on screen every 3-4 minutes with a name I was not interested to remember as it was a place I had no connection to, and never would. I didn't know anybody's name or care at the end because so much was thrown at me in 2 hours and I didn't love any of the humor/backstory of the cast. Jyn was relatable as her parents protected her from the Empire and her mother died to save her. However, I thought her motivations for the rest of the movie as an adult were strange and unexplained other than wanting to find her father for answers. The BEST part about the movie was the spaceship battle in the third act of the movie; I was in awe at how good the action looked and sounded. I thoroughly enjoyed that....then got cut back to characters dying on a beach like Saving Private Ryan.....why? This is not Star Wars, this is terrible.The most confusing character was Saw Gerrera (I had to Google that name, I didn't hear or remember the name even while I was watching the movie). What was his relationship to Jyn and why should I care about his movement or town or? What? Why is he weezing and Forest Whitaker talking like that? It makes the expositional dialogue even harder to understand as the movie in introducing characters are such a rapid rate, I can't remember anybody's story or why the main characters are moving from one planet quickly to another. This was suuuuch a bad character, I shed no tears as he died and I quickly realized ""Ah, everybody is going to die at the end, aren't they. Makes no difference to me.""And here comes, in my opinion, the worst aspect of the movie, in that I feel the movie never had to be made. The whole premise, from how I observed the story, was to explain the engineered weakness of the Death Star by Jyn's father so that Luke and the Resistance have an explanation how they could topple the Empire in A New Hope. Who cares? Because I definitely did not. You are supposed to suspend your disbelief when watching fictional movies and the thermal exhaust port on the Death Star was OBVIOUSLY a deus ex machina for Luke to begin his path towards power and learning to become a Jedi, for Anakin to meet his son and ultimately restore balance to the Force by killing the Emperor. Are we next going to explain why Death Star II had a flight path from the outside to the core, so that Lando could destroy that Death Star now? I don't think so, because the audience bought that such a movie trope needed to be there so that the story could keep moving.Please do not make more movies like this, with characters rapidly being introduced then dying with little emotional weight, with planets rapidly being cast on screen then forgotten as they are not visited for very long, and please forget about explaining small details in the Star Wars story and instead create new intellectual scenes in the Star Wars galaxy. Create new characters separate from the main conflict or a long ago back story to the Jedi/Sith conflict. People care about Anakin Skywalker and his story, about the Force! Not side stories with ultimately little meaning. Just my thoughts. This movie gets a 5/10, maybe even lower if I would see it again. Oh and I liked the Tarkin CGI and thought he was a good character, however I thought the Leia CGI was unnecessary and almost symbolism for how not needed this film was in the Star Wars saga."
" Finally a Star Wars movie to put on the same shelf as the originals!!!!!?####
",-0.6973,0.5858,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars Rouge One is at last the prequel we've been waiting for. It retains Lucas's flavor and at the same time isn't afraid to be original. The action sequences rock, Darth Vader was better then ever. The only problem was the Japanese samurai warrior and his bamboo stick. However as a whole this movie had a simple plot, like a the original Star Wars movies, the characters were very well crafted and lovable. And all the criticism about the CGI is crap, rouge couldn't of done without it. The film has all the right story elements which makes it not only a great Star Wars film, but a awesome movie. The film also should've at least been nominated for Best picture, but being that it's on the surface apolitical it couldn't be nominated. Instead Moonlight and fences are nominated, two crappy films with the same agenda. Well maybe Star Wars 8 will scrape a nomination. Anyways rouge one rocked, kicked the force awakens to f***n mustard, and can be placed on the same shelf as the original trilogy."

I know, I'm late. Poor uni student, blah blah blah. I had a free ticket that was going to expire tomorrow so I dragged my housemate out into this blasted heat and went to see it.And oh my google. My face leaked from every orifice.Both joy and sadness, mind you. I'm a long term fan of the movies (sorry television and written work, I'm just not that into you), so whenever there was even the slightest throwback it hit me in the feels. For fans of the franchise you won't be disappointed in this installment and it can stand up next to the original series as a great.For those who haven't seen the other Star Wars, don't worry. It's a 'stand-alone' meaning you don't have to have seen any of the others for it to be a complete story to entertain and thrill you. However, this *is* a linking story so there is a before and after that you may wish to explore after dipping your toes into a universe far, far away. The story arc is not dented as it sometimes is with add-ons and it's satisfying on it's own.SPOILERS INCOMING.My biggest disappointment with Rouge One was actually in the very first minute. There was no rolling text. Something that every movie has had so far. It was jarring and the fan in me was waiting for that big trill of music and the story so far. It never came.In this way, I also became a little disorientated with the fact that they messed with the original score of the films. It was like walking into your best friend's apartment drunk after they'd moved the furniture. I get what they were going for, pairing off from the older films but in my opinion it didn't work.These are trifling things though. In the big picture the story was complete and contained, embellished enough for the fans and understandable enough for the newbies. The CGI for the old characters who have ages or passed on (Carrie, I love you) was superb.While my brain knew how the ending must go (having seen the movies after it) I was still shocked and amazed at how it panned out, the ending was amazingly tense and choreographed and yes, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.In all, 8.5 out of 10 in my opinion. I love it, I will watch it endlessly and K2 will forever be the sassiest of droids, but there is room for improvement. A classic, entertaining and endearing watch I recommend for all."
" First ""Star Wars Story"" A Rousing Success
",0.0258,0.7761,2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"When the Star Wars franchise was turned over to Disney from George Lucas, many worried that it would be ""commodified"" too much, to the point that their would be an over-saturation and dilution of the material. ""Rogue One"", the first ""Star Wars Story"" (not featuring the canon roman numerals or opening scrawl), would be the initial test to see how the material would be handled. By almost all accounts, it was a tremendous success!For a basic plot summary (only minor spoilers), ""Rogue One"" tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance steals the plans for the Imperial Death Star weapon, which sets up the events of Episode IV: A New Hope. The film focuses on Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), daughter of the Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) forced to work for the Empire on the Death Star itself. When of age to join the Rebel cause, Jyn meets the mysterious Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and then is sent on a dangerous mission with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). On the ""Dark Side"" of things, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is tasked with making sure the Death Star is fully operational, overseen by Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry/CGI) and even Lord Vader himself.When coming into this movie experience, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Suffice it to say, it pretty much blew away even those ambiguous expectations. It doesn't try to do too much, yet at the same time it isn't too sparse and thus is filled with call-backs or ""easter eggs"" to ""A New Hope"". It really does find that perfect balance. One thing to be prepared for is a lot of material to be throw at you in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film. It jumps around to many different planets and puts a lot of balls in the air. To be honest, halfway through the film I was a bit worried that it was going to be ""just okay"". The final half or two-thirds, however, sees everything come together in a way that is just as impressive (both dramatically and visually) as any piece in the rest of the Star Wars canon.It's amazing to me how a single scene from ""A New Hope"" (evaluating the stolen Death Star plans) could inspire an entire film, and I'm even more impressed that a really solid movie could be produced as a result! It would be very, very easy for Disney to start cranking these movies out (they are guaranteed money-makers right now) irregardless of quality, but fortunately the Mouse House seems (at least so far) to be taking the utmost care of the franchise. My brothers and I will be arguing for months over where to watch this movie in the grand scheme of things, and I consider perhaps the best compliment I can give a Star Wars film."
" ""if you continue to fight, what will you become?""
",-0.3818,0.9939,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"The biggest fear I had for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was that it would lose the propulsive and mythical identity the rest of the saga carried. At every point in the seven film franchise, regardless of quality, Star Wars was about finding your place within the context of your life. Whether it be Anakin, Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia, Han...even Rey or Finn; everyone sought to identify and accept the role they felt was offered to them. The seven films were tied together by a vague thematic connective tissue; a powerful thru-line of mythical narrative beats and rousing spectacle. So how does Rogue One fit into all this? What story could it tell to find a place among those giants?Turns out I underestimated the flexibility of that connective tissue; because Rogue One is right at home within this franchise. Here we find Jyn, another brilliant heroine lost in the world offered to her. It's made apparent that she is indifferent to that which doesn't directly effect her; apathetic to all things not immediately down her path. As the film progresses, she finds a reason to fight and to believe in the power of hope. That's a key word in this movie, hope. Another fundamental thru-line to this entire saga. The hope to become the person you aspire to be. The hope to resist a dangerous tide of tyranny and maintain systematic order. The hope to remain faithful to a diminishing religion. The hope to overthrow a tyrannical superpower in hopes of equality and justice. As the film blatantly asserts, this is a franchise built on hope. Misguided or not, Rogue One taps into that sincere yearning, that basic bravery required to oppose that which towers over you.Rogue one includes just as interesting characters such as, Diego Luna's comedic and assassin-esque Cassian Andor, Donnie yen's blind staff wielding Chirrut imwe, Ben Mendelson's villainous Director krennic, hell even K-2SO is a well written character. Each and every character strives on their unique features and combine to make a perfect cast, Donnie Yen outshining them all. The child-like brilliance of George Lucas' original Star Wars returns in Rogue One as it brings new and enriching characters throughout.It's action is amazingly done, combined with set pieces so beautiful, Rogue One brings an action/sci-do film for the ages. The final beach scene was both fantastic and emotionally satisfying I cried. I didn't know what they would do to have it end, but the entire last half of the film is worth seeing this alone. Packed with depth, emotion, and love, Edwards made a final sequence unprecedented by anything else. The conclusion to the film was also satisfactory in its connection to the original film; Darth Vader's brilliant murder rampage, the destruction of the planet, Princess Leia in all her GCI, was so beautifully done.In my eyes, Gareth Edwards' masterclass of Star Wars comes from it's enriching story, flowed beautifully, excellent character development and end, and above all his brilliant way of telling a complete story without nostalgia or a sequel. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story took me by surprise, I loved it. It's possibly better The Force Awakens, damn this film was phenomenal."

With ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" Lucas Films and Walt Disney Pictures have started the analyzing elements of looking at different ways to tell the stories of some of our most beloved characters, while introducing new ones. Gareth Edwards' firm direction, in partnership with Greig Fraser's stunning cinematography, makes for a lavish and intense new chapter in the ""Star Wars"" mythology.The first of the Star Wars standalone films, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" tells the story of a group of unlikely heroes that band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction.Boasting an impressive cast that is led by Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones, it is one of the film's best attributes. Diversity in film has been called upon by every corner of the cinematic community and ""Star Wars,"" Lucas Films, and Walt Disney do not get enough credit in being of the first to fully embrace this notion into its most profitable franchise. As Jyn Erso, Jones leads with intensity, delivering a near heartbreaking interpretation of the most unlikely hero.Of the players, the fanboys of the universe will scream the names of Chirru Imwe, played exquisitely by Donnie Yen, or K-2SO, played with spunk by Alan Tudyk. You'll have your fill with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), whose stern presence isn't always a standout, but Bodhi Rook (played by Riz Ahmed) seems like a spirit animal of Poe from ""The Force Awakens.""Villains here have no shortage of complexities, as Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic is sensational, given alongside some other ""amazing"" surprises. I'll leave them for you to experience yourself.Technically speaking, this is one of the franchise's most vivacious productions. The aforementioned Greig Fraser delivers grit and action in his abilities to capture them with the lens. John Gilroy, Colin Goudie and Jabez Olssen cut the film to an impeccable action- adventure that stands toe-to-toe with anything delivered in 2016.Having big shoes to fill in John Williams' illustrious classic score, Michael Giacchino rises to the occasion and then some with his compositions. It's one of the year's best works. Doug Chiang and Neil Lamont's production design opens the doors to a new world that doesn't feel too familiar or too standard for the average fan.""Star Wars"" is only as good as its story and script. Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy, John Knoll and Gary Whitta lay the foundation down for an alluring tale. On paper, hearing about how the rebels acquire the Death Star plans is not particularly compelling cinema that we are running to see, but this group accepts the challenge. With the exception of some shoehorned entries of new and classic characters, ""Rogue One"" finds its balance in presenting this world to an avid die-hard fan and a casual movie-goer that is walking into this universe for the very first time.Early reports of a ""darker"" and ""more gritty"" film have been around for months. We definitely have that here, but the insert of comedic beats often feel inserted so the audience can feel some joy in this tragic tale. It's safe to say that we are more than prepared for a devastation story that wrecks the minds of viewers everywhere – perhaps with ""Episode VIII?""Here is the main takeaway: this film has perhaps the best Darth Vader scene in franchise history. Let's talk about it in the comments after you see it.""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" successfully achieves everything it sets out to do. Action-packed and glorious in its engaging and oftentimes exotic dimensions of storytelling, it is absolutely stirring. Fans will be overjoyed and it becomes another classic chapter that we will be able to revisit in a weekend-long marathon somewhere in a galaxy far, far away.GRADE: (★★★½)"
" The fall of the Empire begins with ""Rogue One.""
",0.0,-0.8784,2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Having lived through the initial pandemonium that was the original Star Wars film, I have been a loyal follower of the evolution of Star Wars over the years. Now we have a stand alone film set within the Star Wars universe, which is certainly a curiosity. So for ""Rogue One"" I was very open minded, not knowing what to expect and willing to form an opinion based on the presentation. In other words, I tried not to have either any expectations or preconceptions when I went into the theater to see the film.I have to admit I had to overcome an initial feeling of ""this is boring"" before I became immersed in the story. Once I did so, I found a movie that was expertly crafted. From the dialogue to the action sequences, the various details were handled in such a way as to create an experience that ended up being very effectively bittersweet, much like ""The Empire Strikes Back.""*Spoilers Ahead*Star Wars fans know that the Death Star plans were stolen and used to help destroy that planet-killer in ""A New Hope."" ""Rogue One"" is the story of how those plans were actually acquired, and the sacrifices made by many people in order to get those plans. ""Rogue One"" is the most adult Star Wars film, and the characters are not one-dimensional. The film shows a side of the rebels fighting the Empire we haven't seen before. These people are gritty, not necessarily nice, and possess personal baggage appropriate for those involved with an underground war against an established government.The direction, by Gareth Edwards, is quite probably the best of the entire Star Wars series. The story moves along crisply, and the actors are put through their paces with aplomb. There aren't any wasted moments, and there is an underlying seriousness that is absent in all the other Star Wars movies. There is no over-the-top acting in ""Rogue One,"" and the screenplay doesn't possess that element of corniness we've come to expect from Star Wars films. I wish Edwards was directing Episode VIII, but that film is being directed by Rian Johnson. I just hope Johnson does as good a job with ""The Last Jedi"" as Edwards did with ""Rogue One.""Of special note are the set designs in ""Rogue One."" The locations and sets are unique to the Star Wars series for the most part, and the look and feel of the props, costumes and sets capture something that seems missing from the other Star Wars films. I guess the best way to put it is that there was an element of realism in ""Rogue One"" that seems missing from the other movies.I suppose that with the success of ""Rogue One"" we will be treated to other stand alone films that will fill in gaps in the overall Star Wars saga. I hope that happens, but we'll have to wait and see."
" Neither the best nor the worst
",-0.0191,0.902,2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"So, I went to see the movie, but I kind of forgot to write a review. While most reviews I saw here made me believe this would be the best movie, it sadly wasn't. The plot was extremely simple and looked like an RPG game (go to A spot, get an item, get it to B spot), while at the same time it moved so slow. It put a lot of characters, that weren't developed at all and if you have seen it, you know that there was no need for so many characters. The main ""couple"" had no chemistry AT ALL. However, a really good thing this movie had going for it was the action. Sincerelly, it had the best action scenes in the series, along with the coolest Vader scene.A sad thing is that this movie is literally a story that had no need to be a movie. It covers just the quote ""Many spies died for these plans"" in Episode IV. I am hopeful for a future movie with better story with the action scenes of this one, like maybe an Empire-based movie.So, knowing what most people think about this movie I'm expecting a lot of people to disagree with my opinion. However, this doesn't change that the things I've said are the truth."
" Enjoyable, but overrated. So much potential lost.
",-0.339,-0.9224,2017-02-12 00:00:00,5,"In layman's terms, I feared this movie would be Jurassic Park 3, an unnecessary sequel that adds nothing to the series. But it turned out to be like Jurassic Word, a fairly entertaining sequel that does add something, had bland characters, and an exciting new world that became unexplored scenery, but it did end with a pretty entertaining climax. Rogue One was better than I feared, but not as good as I hoped. It had so much potential and wasted nearly all of them.It tried to be a war movie in Star Wars, but fell into that trap of trying to be serious but just coming off boring. Ironically, when the real war started in the climax, it became less the ""war movie"" it's been trying to be, and more a standard Star Wars movie, where battles were fun and exciting to watch, not horrifying and grim. The ending was a mistake. The main characters died, and the movie rushed forward and pushed the rest of the movie behind it, diminishing the movie as a standalone movie with its own ending. It was just a big set up for A New Hope.This movie has too many new planets. It jumps from one planet to another, hoping to make the universe appear bigger, and tried less to make each location actually interesting. The Phantom Menace had a beautiful planet that needs to be protected, a desert planet with chariot races, and a city planet, capital of the Republic. Each location plays a role in the main characters' actions. All other Star Wars movies did this too. Rogue One did none of this. On Jedha, the only interesting planet, the giant statues and remnants of an old Jedi-like culture were pushed to the background and became nothing but scenery. No exploring ruins, no interacting with the culture, nothing. Most of the characters had some pretty good story ideas, but also fell short. Like many movies before, this movie had too many new characters, and struggled to make all of them interesting. In A New Hope, Han Solo was a self-serving outlaw antihero, and this personality echoed throughout everything he did in the movie. Unfortunately, in this movie, the characters introduce themselves, and then audiences have to carry this first impression with them throughout the rest of the movie.Jyn Erso lost her family, yet there was little to show she missed her family and hated the Empire. The scene with Jyn in prison, suggest that she is rebellious and antisocial, but in the movie, she showed little memorable attitude.Cassian shot an innocent man out of necessity, introducing himself as an antihero who represents the dirty side of the heroic rebels. This is the only controversial act we see him do in the whole movie. He had a chance to assassinate Jyn's father on orders, and he ultimately chose not to. There was so little prior character development for him, that it's hard to tell if he was a changed man, or merely adapted to the changing situation. K2SO, the reprogrammed imperial droid, was arguably the only character with an interesting personality. I could close my eyes, and he was the only character I enjoyed listening to. He was the only one who provided some much needed attitude.Chirrut Îmwe, AKA the Asian guy, was unfortunately a token stereotypical Asian guy. He used martial arts against the bad guys, never does it again, and just mutters one quote about the Force throughout the movie, establishing himself as deeply religious. The movie never used him as a teacher/mentor-figure to the others, or anything. We don't know why he followed the other main characters. He got swept up for the ride, and never left. Baze, Chirrut's friend, whose name I had to look up, was just there to grieve for Cirruit's death at the end. The ex-Imperial pilot who defected from the Empire, well, there's really nothing else to say about him. We don't know why he defected, and I never did remembered his name. Saw Gerrera was an extremist in the Rebellion. Like Cassian, he could have represented the murderous side of the rebellion. And yet, the most grim things he did was put sacks over people's heads (like terrorists?), and interrogate the pilot with a silly tentacled creature that reads minds(?). And the main villain had more personality than most of the cast. Unfortunately, the film did very little to show how evil and menacing he could truly be. He was responsible for the death of Jyn's family. And yet, when these two enemies finally face each other for the first time, the villain was swiftly shot down by somebody else besides Jyn, and the confrontation ended with no real climax. This movie started a lot of bold and innovative ideas, but stopped after barely dipping in. It was a serious war movie that dragged for the first half, then became a standard Star Wars movie with an exciting climax. It created a bigger but less interesting world. It introduced the main characters and made them interesting quickly, and then forgot to actually KEEP them interesting. And it couldn't decide if it was a standalone film, or an overly long introduction to the next movie. Much of the genuinely deserved love and praise for the movie depends on the exciting climax, where most of the content was less original and more familiar. And it really was a pretty damn good climax. Whether or not the audience can take the excitement of the epic climax and walk away from the movie with that same impression is up to each individual viewer. As for the rest of the movie, if anybody finds the characters and story just as strong, interesting and compelling to watch, I would really need an explanation why."
" A Decent Addition to the Star Wars Saga
",-0.5574,-0.996,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Star Wars Rogue One puts the ""war"" in Star Wars. It is gritty, dirty, and a dark trail that eventually leads to hope. It starts without a crawl, but we quickly meet Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and her parents on a remote ring world. An Empire Officer known as Orson Krenic craves the power and grandeur behind the building of the Death Star and forces Jyn's father, Galen Esro (Mads Mikkelson) back to the Empire to help build it. Jyn was raised by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) for several years. One day, he disappears, seeking to join an extreme wing of the Rebellion against the Empire, and she is now on her own. Another faction of the Rebellion liberates her from an Empire transport and she finds herself flung into the Rebellion. Her two allies, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and a droid K2SO (Voice of Alyn Turdyk) are on a mission to find an Empire pilot who has defected. He has knowledge of the Death Star. On their way to find him, they find two more allies, Baze Mallbus (Wen Jian) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen). A series of events leads our rebels to a lonely planet where Jyn is reunited briefly with her father, to find out he has a plan of his own. Once they return to the Rebel Base on Yavin 4, rebels contemplate deserting their cause out of fear. Jyn, Assian, Baze and Chirrut cannot walk away from it, though. Finding a group of rebels determined to forge ahead, they make a run at stealing the plans of the Death Star. First out, this has good action, paced with some character development and story development. It is a dark side of the rebellion that has soldiers who have gone to extreme measures for their cause. Moreover, they have been hardened by the gritty, dark side of war. And this is the troops part of war, lacking the Force, light sabers, and duels. the closest we get to the Force is Chirrut, a blind man who would rather chant his way with the Force instead of emptying himself. Of course, the sinister Darth Vader is back, with the voice of James Earl Jones. He did have ample screen time and a pretty good battle scene against some rebel soldiers. The best part was the epic battle between the Rebellion and the Empire in the effort to steal the Death Star Plans. And for all the nitpickers who griped about the design of the Death Star will find a very satisfying answer. The characters are not fleshed out as well as the original trilogy, and the CGI used for the return of Grand Moff Tarkin was used way too much and will likely kick an audience out of the story for a while. Still, overall, this has it all for Star Wars fans: fights, space combat, droids, and decent stories, decent characters, and the perfect cameos."
" Entertaining new take on the Star Wars universe
",-0.1779,0.961,2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Rogue One: A Star Wars story is the first Star Wars Anthology film. First the positives: the action scenes were gritty and well filmed, K2SO was great comedic relief. And the final act of Rogue One was excellent with high stakes and tense action. Unfortunately Rogue One suffers from weak characters and a thin story. In short if the previous films didn't make you like Star Wars, this one definitely won't. It definitely is entertaining and not dull like Episodes I&II but it also isn't as engaging as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens. All the characters had their moments but I never cared about them truly. Overall my favorite part of this film were the brief but effective scenes featuring Darth Vader. Voiced once again by the ever great James Earl Jones."
" A real Star Wars story after so many failures
",-0.7832,0.8084,2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"For me this is a Star Wars movie, although I admit it contains some weird, unusual elements which are not generally welcome by many fans. Still I felt the Star Wars feeling for the first time since ROTJ. It presented complex worlds and the empire, space combats, ground assaults were presented as it has to be on the big screen. The story is reasonable and good: The only thing which is hard to accept its more darker tone than the original trilogies (prequels and the latest night-mare under SW name better to be forgotten forever). The plot is like a dirty dozen plot. We have a bunch of not really nice people (it was already said by Cassian in the movie) or lost"" people (like Jyn or the blind Jedi Kung Fu Master) for a suicide mission in the world of SW. Dark, isn't it? It is a SW tale, but for the adults and I liked it. I liked all the characters as well: I liked even the Jedi Kung Fu Master who lost his eyesight and his lightsabre as well. It worked and it was fresh. And the Universe is big much bigger than our world, so it could be weird, but far more enjoyable than the lame, Tatooine folk costume uniformed jedis. I understand that Darth Vader's fight scene was completely useless, but it was so good. Let that amount of special effect be afforded for the sake of entertainment.And what I liked the most: I said during watching it, a SW movie without uselessly starring the droids. And then Bang! They were there as cherry on the top, but their timing and limited presence were just perfect.I would score it 9.5, as it was not perfect only for its darker tone, as SW is a fairy-tale for me not a tragedy. (Although I understand why everybody has to be perished, but after some time I would be able to fiction a better ending)."
" The darkest Star Wars movie so far
",-0.7783,0.8308,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Rogue One, detailing the story behind the theft of the original Death Star blueprints, was a pleasant surprise for me. It's the first major Star Wars film ever made that is not part of the original saga of trilogies and thus it was a bit unclear just what niche it was going to fill. And don't get me wrong, I like the plot for this movie. It was alluded back in the original Star Wars that there was a mission to steal the blueprints that eventually allowed Luke Skywalker to destroy the Death Star, so why not tell it. Plus, I'm not at all bothered by the fact that I already kind of knew how the film would end, like some complainers have been. It's like complaining about the fact that a Disney movie is going to have a happy ending no matter what.But still, it was a bit unclear just how much effort was going to be put into this, and luckily they didn't disappoint. I'd say that this is just as good as Force Awakens. It's instantly recognizable as Star Wars, broadens the universe and gives us exactly the kind of action adventure we want. The final battle especially, over and on the garden world of Scarif, is one of the best battle scenes we've yet seen in Star Wars. It's creative, easy to follow and filled to the brim with tension. It also contains one of the best Darth Vader moments in history. That alone was worth the price of admission, in my mind.The story is also very good. It's a lot darker than the trilogies, by which I mean that it's told as a war story. The Rebellion versus the Empire feels like a proper war, with both sides willing to commit atrocities in the name of their cause. There are casualties aplenty and people don't come out unscathed.The movie is not without its flaws, however. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the main character, is unfortunately a bit flat, as is the main male character Diego Luna (Cassian Andor). Neither of them is terrible, but they're not all that identifiable either. The supporting cast is very strong, however, which makes up for this failing. I especially like the droid K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk.Some have also complained about the fact that the first half of the movie drags a little bit, but personally I didn't notice.All in all Rogue One is more than a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga. If you liked Force Awakens, you're going to like this one just fine."
" A delight for fans and casual movie-goers
",0.6908,0.9962,2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"WHAT'S ROGUE ONE ABOUT? Disney's first Star Wars spin-off film (read: not a Skywalker ""Episode"") is part heist movie, part war film as Rebel forces steal the plans to the Death Star.IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: A) At this point one can look at the Star Wars franchise as a series of individual films or as one giant story; I prefer the latter, as the connective tissue between prequels, excellent animated series, original trilogy, and new trilogy is part of what makes the saga so satisfying. Rogue One ties in to most of these in incredibly rewarding ways, but also serves up a unique story and characters, dazzling action and effects, and a moving arc about fighting to give others hope.Gareth Edwards proves a wise choice for director, composer Michael Giacchino is a fine stand-in (but could never replace) John Williams, and the cast is terrific. Disney's emphasis on strong writing and acting is much appreciated, though I would have enjoyed a longer film if it had meant getting to know these characters better. Still the performers do strong work, with Felicity Jones providing an inspiring lead, Diego Luna nicely-layered, Alan Tudyk delivering wry comic relief as a reprogrammed Imperial robot, and martial arts superstar Donnie Yen giving us impressive moves and the film's best line. Forest Whitaker (as Clone Wars character Saw Gerrera), Mads Mikkelsen, and Ben Mendelsohn all shine.Rogue One strengthens the story of A New Hope, patching up a few holes, and improves the prequels by association (much like the fantastic Clone Wars animated series does). You may know how the basic story ends, but the fates of the individual characters gives the film its heft. Casual moviegoers will have a great time; fans will be ecstatic. Don't miss it.IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Rogue One is rated PG-13. There is no language, drug use, or sexuality. There is plentiful action violence with persons and aliens killed by lazer blast, explosion, and debris. There are many intense moments and some heartbreaking deaths. Several of the protagonists are self-described shady characters who've done ""awful things"" but want to fight for a good cause. One scene near the end may be terrifying for small children (or they may love it; to say more would be to spoil it).ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? No matter what you've done in the past you can do the right thing now. Liberty and standing against oppression may require you to risk your life. There is no greater love than to die for a friend. Evil can only be overcome through unity."

It turned out to be epic in scale, building up to the amazing climax. The story fits in perfectly with Episode IV, and is likely to please most fans of the original trilogy. There were a lot of characters and places that are new to this film, so that it doesn't feel to similar to the other ones. Still, it's familiar enough that you could believe all these events had really happened during their place in the timeline. One disappointment was the character of Gran Moff Tarkin. One of my favorites from the first film, I didn't think we had any memorable lines or moments from him. For the work they must have done to create the performance, I'd hoped they'd use him better."

",0.1531,-0.9516,2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Mostly taking place days before ""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,"" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" puts us at the tip of the spear of the Rebel Alliance. Said tip is headed by two rebels (played by Felicity Jones and Diego Luna) who volunteer to infiltrate a heavily defended, Imperial base to steal the plans to the Empire's dreaded, new weapon, the Death Star.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is the scene when Darth Vader boards a Rebel ship. Invisible within the dark hallway, his breathing can be heardthen the red light saber ignites. Vader straight up murders dozens of rebel soldiers within a span twenty seconds, an unstoppable, evil force moving forward as he kills. It is Darth Vader's most terrifying moment in all of the ""Star Wars"" movies.What makes ""Rogue One"" more satisfying than the last four ""Star Wars"" movies (Episodes I, II, III, and VII) is mostly due to a tight screenplay that does not contain many head-scratching moments that put off ""SW"" fans; and a more brutal depiction of combat where characters that you grow to like may not survive. The ""dogfights"" are also faster paced, have better dialogue, and have great choreography. And last but definitely not least: the numerous characters from Episode IV that are brought back, either through CGI or from unused film footage from the 1977 movie.My ticket to ""Rogue One"" was money well spent, and this title will be part of my Blu-Ray library in the near future.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" An uneven space war movie that's a departure from the Star Wars formula
",-0.8176,-0.9966,2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"This review spoils the entire movie so don't read if you haven't seen it yet.There are all kinds of Star Wars fans - those who adore the old movies but hate the prequels, those who defend the prequels and accuse 'The Force Awakens' of being a sell-out and a copy-cat, and those who think the animated show 'The Clone Wars' or the video games 'Knights of the Old Republic' are the best thing to come out of the franchise.I'm in the camp that liked 'The Force Awakens' but wasn't too impressed with 'Rogue One'. Maybe I'm just a nostalgia fanboy who can't stomach anything new and different - TFA did the Star Wars formula by the book, whereas 'Rogue One' is daring and original. 'Rogue One' is not a proper installment in the Star Wars saga but rather an addition to one of the installments. It leads up to one of the most iconic movies in history. It's a difficult task, especially 40 years after that movie came out. If you watch 'Rogue One' and 'Star Wars' (also called 'Episode IV: A New Hope') back to back the difference in age is noticeable. The pacing is different, the special effects are different, the tone is different.But 'Rogue One' has a tone that's different from any previous Star Wars movie. It's darker and faster, it introduces many characters and kills them off by the end, it features political scheming, and it has morally gray acts of terrorism. Other Star Wars movies are fantasy adventure: 'Rogue One' is more like a war movie. Its characters are agents of political powers, soldiers and spies, and it tells the story of a single operation in a larger conflict. It just happens to take place in space.Does it work? I would say yes, although it stumbles at places. The script feels a bit unfinished at places, a sign that there were many changes to the movie during production. The character of Cassian is introduced as a back-stabbing scoundrel but ends up having a heart of gold, a bit like schizophrenic, exaggerated version of Han Solo's arc in Episode IV. The scene where Jyn's father is killed by friendly fire seems like it sets up Cassian as a troubled and twisted antihero but doesn't follow through, leaving the character half-baked. Saw Gerrera is similarly set up as an interesting, complex political agent, but is killed off before he has a chance to do much of anything.Highlights of the movie were the intense space battles and the brief appearance of Darth Vader at the end, and I liked the scene where Chirrut walks through laser cross-fire unharmed. Maybe I'm just a sucker for space fantasy.I have to mention the controversial CGI recreations of real actors. Peter Cushing died in 1994, and yet here he is on the big screen again in a new role, and he has a surprising amount of screen time. Carrie Fisher only appears briefly, but her appearance has unfortunate implications as she tragically passed away when the movie was still in cinemas and she is due to appear in future Star Wars installments as well, making the end of 'Rogue One' a rather morbid experience in hindsight."

Time and again, however, I felt cheated - ""Wow, what a great scene!"" - whoops, where has it gone? I was enjoying that but I'm rationed to one and a half seconds (""because every Star Wars Fan has seen something like that too often before""? I wonder).Big disappointment with the music, sorry, it attacked rather than enhanced the imagery and narrative.To me it felt like every creative input was handcuffed and manacled by the past, by the need to ""live up"" to something, to, ""satisfy expectations"".The whole Star Wars concept is a most fantastic piece of modern science fiction.""Star Wars"" is to cinema what ""Dune"" was to literature.I still love the original, first and, possibly, the best - but then, I've seen only a few.Those historic and impeccable CGIs should, please, surely have featured, however briefly, right at the start.The Chess Scene was one of the Great Moments in the original, that uniqueness, the Magic, simply cannot be recaptured. There is only ever one First Time. It could, however, be woven in as ""part of everyday life"" something with which we the viewers are presumed to be familiar. It is so brief, it serves as no more than a reference or a reminder.The ""guest appearances"" of C-3PO & R2-D2 were for me too brief and lacked the, how can I put it, ""red carpet"" they deserved. I would like to have seen them for a few more moments at least.I loved the peculiar aliens in their rocket machines, but again, Now You See Them Now You Don't, gone in the blink of an eye.Those ""Other Worlds"", wonderful vistas, I wanted to gaze upon them and drink in the ""Avatar-meets-Blade-Runner"" landscapes but no, whoosh, they're whisked away before you can see the mountain tops.Clearly, many fans love this prequel; the real test, to my mind, is how does it come across to Newbies? Perhaps that is as hard as finding an impartial jury for a world-famous crime (if you'll excuse the analogy).The ""Star Wars"" epic-drama suffers (shock horror) from decades of astounding, hard-earned and much deserved success.Long may the Force continue to bring us great screen moments."
" Rogue One:A Well-Thought But Poorly Executed Story
",0.0,0.9972,2017-01-31 00:00:00,4,"Rogue One is a first spin off in a Star Wars franchise and a first movie in Star Wars Anthology series. It's set right before ""A New Hope"" and shows how the rebels stole the Death Star plans. It's directed by Gareth Edwards, the director of Godzilla (2014), which I loved, bit still I didn't feel a lot of excitement going into this, but I did expect it to be pretty good. And it actually managed to disappoint me.It's not entirely bad, I will say what I liked about it first. Darth Vader, he shows up in only two scenes, but boy does he make an impact in those two scenes. We are reminded of why he is one of the best villains ever and the scene near the end, shows us the Vader we all missed since episode VI, but never got. Well, we've got it now and that scene at the end may quite possibly be the best in the series. The movie has some visually wonderful moments and the action is well- handled. The story helps close a plot-hole about Death Star from a New Hope, I really appreciated that. And now I have a new favorite droid in the series - K-2SO. That guy is brilliant. If you love sarcastic and sassy characters like I do, you will love K-2SO.The sad part is, those are probably the only good parts. Darth Vader is great, yes, but he's barely in the movie at all. Instead we get an extremely uninteresting and paper-thin villain. And why waste such a good opportunity? I'm not asking for Vader to be a main villain, but if you have a chance to put him in the movie, use it a bit more. That's too good of an opportunity to miss. And yet they miss. I just talked about uninteresting villain, and the rest of the characters aren't much better. Some of them may actually end up being interesting if they aren't immediately killed and we're moved to the next plot point. I didn't even care about the main character. We barely knew who she was too. We're just watching things happen before eyes, but we don't feel it. At least I didn't. And how could I? The story itself is good, but it's so poorly executed and fails to grab any interest. Except if you only want to see action. The movie also had re-shoots. And it shows. It really does show. Everyone complained about Suicide Squad for that, and no one complains about this. I'm not a DC fanboy, so if I sound like one, I apologize. But I liked Suicide Squad. It was choppy, yes, but it wasn't terrible. It had the charisma, it had the appeal and it was a lot more fun. Here, nah. There is barely anything interesting about this movie and how this story was executed. We just jump from a plot point to a plot point like nothing happened. The movie just doesn't have any soul. It has a few highlights that don't stop it from being a disappointment. If you just like expensive action sci-fi movies, let alone the quality, sure, enjoy. But this was not my cup of tea."

While director Gareth Edwards paints a vivid picture with state of the art whimsy and a decidedly darker vein with its epic sequences of battles both in space and on terra firma (with grand locales like a sandy beach planet) the screenplay by Christ Weitz and Tony Gilory (based on a story by John Knoll and Gary Whitta) doesn't truly enthrall nor give enough oomph to its new characters to truly care about.

" Gets better with every viewing
",0.4404,0.9906,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"I have seen the film 3 times since it came out. Twice on standard screens of varying quality and once on IMAX in 3D. As expected the IMAX experience was the best by far and enhances the film even more but the main thing that has come out of the multiple viewings is that my estimation of the film is far greater. This is my first review on IMDb and sitting during the thrilling climax it came to mind to do it. I am going to try to get across what i had in my mind at that time to make me want to take this step and do the review.I am a Star Wars fan for sure. Not an obsessed one but it's purely down to seeing the first film at 10 and then growing up with the films in those impressionable years. I wasn't particularly bothered about episodes 1-3 and didn't even see Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith in the cinema, but The Force Awakens was a superbly constructed episode. I was intrigued when i heard about Rogue One when i heard about it, and once the main story line was announced we knew the point of the film, but it was all about how they told the story.In the end we get a film of 2 hours 13 minutes and to me they couldn't of dispensed with any of that time in order to do it properly. The pacing is great and the film builds and builds to the fantastic climax which shows the director knows a bit about the elements which make Star Wars films so great. Not that it's not evident in the whole film, but that climax is outstanding, with snappy editing so we go through swooping fighters in space, to gritty battles on the ground. Some people have likened it to a war film, going from battle to battle and I can see what they mean for sure. I don't agree with people saying the middle bit is hard going, and not sure why people sometimes just say things for the sake of saying something when reviewing films. I suppose there are bits which don't match up to the rest of the film but films need those bits for the overall story. All the best films in history have suffered the same.I won't go into detailed views of the cast and performances but a shout out to the portrayal of K-2SO by Alan Tudyk. A classic Star Wars robot character. Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe is also excellent, and Ben Mendelsohn plays a nasty Krennic well. Also a mention about the score. Not John Williams this time but Michael Giacchino's music is brilliant and every now and then pulls in some of those classic themes from the old movies.During that final 30 minutes the emotions were stirring inside of me. Some tears and a few deep intakes of breathe. Then I realized that on each viewing i had been pulled in the same way each time and it takes a good film to stir the emotions two more times when you know what's going to happen. It's at that point that i decided i needed to review it, and i hope this makes many more people want to see it. Don't go in expecting it to be up there with your favorite film of the other seven, but give it a chance."
" A welcome addition to the universe, but misses the greatness of the better Star Wars movies...
",-0.34,0.9887,2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"After the resounding success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" Lucasarts Studios has rewarded the loyal Star Wars fans with a film that would introduce us to the story about how the rebel alliance exactly got to the plans of the ' Death Star' in the beginning of the movie where it all started. In this way, the film builds on the success that Star Wars with her first 3 films has amassed, which is a very smart choice. We can't exactly say the same about the prequels sadlySay what you want but the pre- quels were now not really a bull's eye. The story focuses around Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who from an early age since losing her parents, took on a rebellious path which has proved quite troublesome for The Empire apparently. When she meets Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), a member of the Rebel Alliance, she unwittingly lands into a plot against The Empire. Gradually the two in contact with various individuals who all have reason enough to join the group. The most notable of which are the duo of Chirrut Îmwe a blind (force wielding) ninja-like fighter, his best buddy Baze Malbus and K-2SO ( a hilarious re-programmed Empire-droid, with a great use of sarcasm). The mission sounds simpler than it seems: getting a hold of the plans of the Death Star to prevent the whole Galaxy being under the power of The Empire. The 'Star Wars '-label on this film is both a curse as a blessing: on the one hand it brings the return to this ""Galaxy far far away"" nostalgia back. The grim post-apocalyptic atmosphere that the original trilogy had as well,finds its roots deep into this movie as well, the visual effects, the costumes and the overall atmosphere throughout this movies is a joy to watch and something you don't really find in a lot of movies nowadays.On the other hand, the fact that this film was clearly as a story 'leading up to' (although is already 40 years old) A New Hope, makes the film also firmly limited in its freedoms: While this movie has created so many things you want to know more about, the movie simply doesn't have enough time to go into much dept about them. The characters suffer the most here. Outside the main character, Jyn Erso, none of the Rogue-One group members get a lot of time to develop their backstory, their motives of really much of an arc. So you feel little to no involvement when they are in danger during the suspenseful scènes. You just know too little about these characters to experience a real commitment. When u have already seen the original trilogy (as I suspect you did), you also kind of know where this whole story is going. While this is not fully deal-breaking, it does take away a bit of it stakes throughout the movie. The film is also rather slow start during the first part and it really takes a while to get the movie going. The first half of the movie does need quite a long time to orient the events in the universe and sometimes this feels orchestrated. I had a feeling that throughout the movie the paths of the characters were already pretty much set and this gave me a a bit of a compromising experience. However, the biggest problem that this movie will probable face is the fact that it made bad use of its. By putting our most favorite bad guy in the Galaxy in the trailers a lot of Star Wars fans had high expectations for the screen time that Darth Vader would receive during the movie. Unfortunately Darth Vader only appears 2 scenes. Although one of the scenes was absolutely amazing to watch (you will know it when you see it), I can't deny that I was a bit bummed out by only seeing him this much. That being said, Rogue One does contain at his core something where every Star Wars fan instantly falls in love with. The fact that Rogue One also answers some questions where a lot of fans have been waiting for 40 years for, does make this movie relevant. There are also some very nice treats for the very attentive fans amongst us, who will be rewarded for knowing and remembering all of their Star Wars-trivia (bonus geek points!) Last but certainly not least the movie is also surprisingly funny, much credit here for goes to the sarcastic droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk). All in all this movie is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe. Star Wars fans that don't get their expectations too high will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. If you previously, however, weren't Star Wars fan was, this movie will not suddenly win you over.Conscensus: don't go with too many expectations to this movie (not sure if you have a lot of Darth Vader expected). The film comes when slow start but once the action starts, both action-fans as Star-wars lovers really enjoy this movie. You also want to watch' A New Hope ' again right away!"
" Another awesome addition to a great series
",0.8481,0.9919,2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"All right, my review is a little late, and for that I apologize. I wanted to make sure my pure fanboyism over Star Wars didn't take completely over. Unfortunately, this was an awesome Star Wars movie, and while it did have a few faults, they were so minor in my opinion that they did not take away from the sheer awesomness of this movie.Grade: 10/10, A+Does this movie truly deserve a 10/10 grade? That's debatable, and if you don't think it deserves that, I can completely understand. But everything in this movie worked for me, other than a few minor things, but as I don't grade on aesthetics, I can't really fault the movie for them. Should the movie have had an opening crawl with the Star Wars theme? Yes, it should have. Did it truly, completely need it? No, it did not. Should the movie have been scored by John Williams? Yes. Did it truly, completely need John Williams? No.Story: 10/10 You cannot fault the story in any way, shape or form. Everything you needed to know to tell the story completely was there. There was nothing missing, there were no plot holes, and the character development was great considering these were characters never mentioned again in the later movies. Every part of this movie led to the fantastic conclusion which was awe-inspiring in its greatness.Character Development: 10/10 Considering how the movie ends, and the fact the characters in this movie are never mentioned later, the character development for them all was pretty solid. Could it have been better? Of course. But it's not really enough to take points away for. I liked all the characters in this movie-- some more than others, yes--but everyone served their purpose and did what they had to to make this an exciting experience for me.Directing: 10/10 Gareth Edwards, who brought us Godzilla 2014, had me a bit nervous as the director, because he famously had a Godzilla movie that barely had Godzilla in it. So I didn't really know what to expect from Rogue One. All I can say is, you did a damn fine job, Gareth, and I hope you do another Star Wars movie later. He told a great story here.Casting: 10/10 Great cast! Everyone was perfect in their role and I liked everyone immensely!Acting: 10/10 Everyone played their parts perfectly!Cinematography: 10/10 Some people might have a problem with parts of the CGI in this movie, and again, I can't fault you if you did. But to me, every part was almost perfect, including the two fully CGI actors who should not have been in the movie but thankfully were. No spoilers, though I'm sure almost everyone has seen the movie by now. Again, perhaps not perfect, but it shows what Hollywood will be capable of--and in a way, that's rather scary.Music: 10/10 Michael Giacchino is not John Williams, but considering his scored this movie in 4 weeks is phenomenal in and of itself. So, I'll cut him some slack for that. The music was still very Star- Warsy, and while it may not have been as memorable as John Williams' music, it was still darn good. I can't take away points when he gave us something still spectacular in such a short time.Pacing: 10/10 Did not want to fall asleep once in this movie. It started off with a bang and kept going to a very thrilling and unexpected, jaw-dropping climax.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Everything felt and looked just like something should in a Star Wars movie. Great job!Enjoyment: 10/10 If I could, I'd probably give my enjoyment a 13/10 because I really loved this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie that didn't have anything geared towards kids in it. No Gungans, no Ewoks, not cute and cuddly creatures. This was a movie about a mission, and that mission was awesome and dark and grim and more than I was expecting it to be. Gareth Edwards outdid himself in my opinion.To show how this movie ranks against the other Star Wars movies, I'll post all my scores below:Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - 10/10 Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens - 9.6/10 Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back - 9.6/10 Star Wars IV: A New Hope - 9.6/10 Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi - 9.0/10 Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith - 8.5/10 Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones - 8.1/10 Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace - 7.8/10Before anyone says anything, I had a few problems with Empire and A New Hope that were enough to keep me from putting them above Force Awakens. None of the movies were perfect, but Force Awakens I just enjoyed more, which is why it has the same grade but is placed above Empire and A New Hope."
" Not your typical Stars Wars movie
",-0.5574,0.8443,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"OK so to start we really were excited to go see this. With it like making a billion dollars in total sales it must be awesome. First of all its a long movie 2hrs 13 minutes long and with the 9 previews close to 3 rs. Second Expecting the John Williams soundtrack with the powerful horns and strings intro. NOPE its a new score of some sort. Reminds me of the sound someone was suppose to come with each time you entered the building in Transformers Age of Extinction uninspiring and flat. Then of course the black space shot pan up or down planet or battle shot. We pan down to a planet and an imperial ship landing on it. This movie starts out slow. Really slow compared to the other ones. So sit back and wait for it. Finally we get to meet Sau Gurerro. OK Hess like the rebels Darth Vader but not terrifying like Darth is. The facial overlays the CG isn't that good Clearly their faces are lighted differently than the surrounding lighting.Now here's the important part. A lot of people die in this film. possibly billions of them. Anyone you get attached to in the movie, well Don't cuz they DIE. Everybody dies. WTH? This is the most depressing of all the films. No Jedi no force no sabers other than vader. Its really cool we find out how the Deathstar weapon is designed and what powers it. This thing is terrifying. We get to see up close very up close shots of what it does and how the planets are ripped apart.One thing I wish they did differently is not show us Anakin in his recovery chambers without the Darth life suit on. I don't know without Georges touches and Abrahams guidance on it. its turns into basically the battle of Iwo Jima and the quest for the Enigma box.WE do get see a very well done battle though a very long one. That was a new site to behold. Also loved the new U wing fighter transport and yes my fave the Y wings show up in this to. It does segway right into Episode 4 really well. I don't know if I'm adding this to our collection in the future. WE have every version of the other Star Wars movies.If you are expecting the old Star Wars film style. Don't. You are going to need to open your mind to this one. ITS NOT like the other films at all."
" Surprising for a Star Wars Movie
",-0.3612,-0.9979,2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Rogue One opens up to a rainy scene, grassland plains between rolling hills, with a little girl running in the mud. She goes home to her parents and her father who tells her ""it's time"". This episode in the Star Wars franchise started out as any other. I was expecting a movie with the same plot lines, and typical characters without any depth. But I was surprised by the Star Wars movie. We open up to a seven of the girl years later, after her mother has been killed, and her. Father has been taken by the Empire. She manages to escape an Empire truck with the help of the resistance. She learns that her father is with the Empire against his will, making plans for the Death Star, which the resistance is trying to obtain. And thus begins the mission of movie. At points in Rogue One there is some tension between the characters, which lead to these sad backstory type sentimental lines, which don't really work for the movie. But these moments don't take away from the plot line. From the star of the movie comparisons can be seen between the markets of different planets and the Syria/Middle East conflict. The Empire can be seen on the planet, with their big militarized trucks mining and looting special crystals from temples to use to power the Death Star. They're going through the busy streets, storm troopers following behind. Then gunfire erupts as a rebel group starts to shoot at the trucks. The storm troopers fight back with large army robots and grenades, all the while civilians re caught in the crossfire. The girl, Jyn, fights with resistance member Cassian, who kills another member of a different rebellion. They are captured and taken back to their base, which turns out to be led by Jyn's uncle who raised her after her father was captured. Jyn is reunited with her uncle who she's not too pleased to see after he abandoned her. He apologizes saying it was necessary to save her, after which they make plans to take the Death Star plans. Jyn is joined by a reverse team of resistance fighters. The ending scene of rogue one seems very much like a war scene. Bombs are being thrown as imperial walkers crush the land, and by the end, all of the main characters are killed, a first for a Star Wars movie. One of the reasons the episode stands out against all the others is was because of how much more realistic it was (well, as realistic as a Star Wars movie can get. In the end, you see Cassian and Jyn struggle to the shore of a beach, all of the comrades dead, their mission a success, they collapse onto the sand as the death ray blasts the planet into oblivion."
" Well, what was I doing before this movie?
",0.2732,0.9868,2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"I couldn't have been more disappointed. Is it because she's pretty? I am not sure. Everyone follows some young women with putoffish personality, isn't a jedi, and doesn't seem all that emotionally interested in being on screen. She wasn't horrible, but she could have been replaced and I wouldn't doubt anyone else they chose would be better overall.Cassian was fair to midland, as the old saying goes. He seemed realistic and believable. He doesn't have much chemistry with his costar, but I think both of them know thats on her.K2 - fantastically voiced and funny lines..... that are totally out of place in a storyline where C3PO is the most cutting edge thing that resembles a human. The lines were like haha but please, a robot repeating that twice for sarcasm? Come on. And his movements were far too human like when you realize the other 6 films didn't do any thing like this motion.Darth Vader didn't seem like Vader except the few seconds walking in the light. The electronic tone was off on JEJ's voice! And it was all too fast. He deserved another scene but apparently it was worse than these? The storyline was a bit (understatement) rushed and messy. Couldn't you have made it better for goodness sakes. The bouncing around lacked execution. It sadly felt like some great college graduate's first film.I didn't mind Leia at the end - it was real enough because they must've used her real life eyes and movements under the cgi. Its Tarkin that spoiled the film. If he were able to see this he would constantly be saying, did someone steal a wax museum replica of me and what's with my eyes??! If technology isn't up to where it needs to be to make it work - get a live actor who resembles Peter Cushing, you amateur hour goofs! Seriously. How did they not watch that and go, ""this is so wrong and distracting..."" I guess when you're just giddy you're making a SW film, believability and continuity are tossed out. I am easily entertained - and wasn't a whole lot watching this! Grade C-"
" Mind Blown!!
",0.0,0.9865,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I was so enthusiastic to see this film I went into this movie with very high expectations! Rogue One was unbelievable! I loved the story. I loved the new characters and peripheral creatures and oddities. I loved the performance from Felicity Jones and most of all I loved the action! I was in awe of the battles and adrenaline packed sequences. The design and look of this film is beautiful and breath-taking. This movie franchise, when done properly, is the best movie franchise ever created. The creativity and imagination is second to none and stimulates the audience like nothing else can. I would recommend everyone with a heartbeat and a pulse see this film! And anyone who writes a negative or hateful review of this movie is just someone who enjoys pissing on what so many other people enjoy. Don't give these folks your attention."
" Good...but the CGI characters ruined it for me.
",-0.4767,0.831,2017-01-26 00:00:00,7,"So overall, I enjoyed this film. It was interesting to see how the plans were obtained and how this film lead into the others. The action was good, although sometimes, especially at the end, the drama was a bit melodramatic.The characters were awesome! So good...wish I could see more of them.The only real NEGATIVE I have is with the CGI characters. From the moment I saw them, there was nothing real about them. I saw 3...if there are more than kudos! But WOW, Gran Moff Tarkin was awful. Leia was awful. Mon Mothma was good...but only b/c she was in the dark initially. But in looking ahead, if the Han Solo stand-alone uses CGI graphics to produce a fake Harrison Ford, and I have to endure watching that for 2 hours in the future, I'm not sure I'll be able to watch it! PLEASE NO MORE CGI CHARACTERS!!! Lucas got away with it for Yoda, but that was an improvement b/c the puppet was...well, clearly a puppet."
" Great story told badly.
",0.25,0.8749,2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"So its a great plot about how the Death Star plans get into the hands of the rebels. But, the plot gets lost in the crazy amount of people, places, and things that really don't add or mean much to the story. The most interesting character in the movie, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who plays the father of the heroine, only gets about 5 minutes of story line. Yet, he is the central figure on how the plans are made available. This movie should have been a spy-thriller, not a series of shoot-em-up battles one after the other that just don't hang together. The ending is great, and gets us where we all wanted to be - heading towards Tatooine."
" Definition of Rebel
",-0.1531,0.91,2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"A small single dialogue in Stars war movie 4 ""The Phantom Menace"" is a whole movie. Only those who have watched the star war movie series can truly understand the value of this movie. This movie is well balanced in many aspects. Even if someone who is new to star wars watches this movie, it will be intriguing to watch all the other ones. The action sequence, the story momentum is brisk till the very end. The way in which everyone and everything was connected was fantastic to watch. The chain of events the shown to achieve a success is a team play. All this was expertly interlinked and connected to sew the wonderful masterpiece. I gave it an 8 as it was close to perfection. I recommend this to ones who wanted to view very different kind of Star wars movie."
" Best star wars for the new generation
",0.1531,0.9327,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One is a very important film for the star wars saga, Because it connects episode 3 and episode 4 together. it fixes plot holes and answered many questions about the past and the future of the series. it explains how the death star plans was stolen. it tell the tales of the heroes that fought and sacrificed their lives for the rebellion which is heart breaking yet somehow satisfying.There are many memorable characters like jyn erso, the empire droid k2, the almost perfect CGI of Tarkin and the late princess LEAH may she rest in peace , is almost breathtaking and invokes a sense of nostalgia seeing them as if they never aged.The settings where great, the special effects was almost perfect. in the end this is the star wars movie fans need not Episode 7.now watching a marathon from episode 1-6 would be a treat you could call this episode 3.5 if you wish."
" Methadone for Star War Junkies
",-0.5994,-0.8065,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"If your are Star War fan it rates higher. If you are not concerned with great CGI and battles on land, air, and space you may get tired of the redundant over long fight scenes.Like with most Star War movies, the robots are as interesting as the people. There is a brief glimpse of the familiar robots and some knew wise cracking metal creations.Everything is just not quite satisfying. The new lead characters don't break a sweat. The music is just a tad off until they use the John Williams theme. All in all it's more like a Diet coke then the real thing. There's a moment with Princess Leia that jolts you back to reality.The movie looks excellent on the big screen and should be seen in a theater with big sound. Fans may be left hungry for more. Don't worry hope for new."
" Sadistic and regressive
",0.0,-0.9975,2017-01-25 00:00:00,3,"Star Wars fans are by definition sexually immature. I sat next to one in the cinema. He teared up when Jyn's father died. I judged him. My first criticism of Rogue One is that there is no sex in it. Adults like sex. Children fear sex. Instead of sex we get violence. I like violence in film when it serves a purpose: hypostasizing Radical Evil. Here its principal purpose is to excite boys and man-boys who cannot stomach sex because they are stuck in an archaic stage of psychic development in which lasers, swords, and phallic corvettes stand in for the terrifying organ of generation and its even more terrifying counterpart. Despite its superficial feminism (more on that further on), the form of the film is deeply anti-woman. Events succeed each other in an airtight masculine logic of cause and effect in which first principles inexorably lead to a predictable conclusion. All the writers have done is swap a biological male out for a biological female. This go-girl Hillary pseudo-feminism abolishes true femininity, which is the domain of ambiguity, desire, and intelligence. Women introduce cuts and gaps into stories. They get bored with the war play. This decentering power is their Jedi skill. Women don't like swords and guns. The phallic woman that is trotted out here (and everywhere else these days) is a little boy's fantasy. Women, don't fall for it. More generally, ROGUE ONE is anti-adult. The fact that everyone dies in the end makes it look adult, but it remains a child's fantasy of adulthood. Why? Because by dying, the main characters preserve the ontological closure of the Star Wars universe. Their sacrifice means something. An adult is someone who realizes that deep down, nothing means anything. Parents hide this from their children.I get the feeling watching this that if these characters could simply learn to have sex with each other, the whole overblown cycle of revolution, war, saber slashing, blaster fire, and death might end. Han Solo was a man and Princess Lea was a woman. Here there are only preteens. The chump who wrote this movie directed American PIE in 2002. It makes sense. That film too concerns the impasses of juvenile sexuality. The battle scene at the end is particularly repulsive from an ideological standpoint. The director chose to give the grunt soldiers (all very masculine-looking men, here symbolically demoted to cannon fodder) uniforms and helmets reminiscent of World War Two and the D-Day assault on Normandy. As if Mr. American Pie knows anything about battle or sacrifice. Once again we are dealing with a child's idealized fantasy of reality. Will we ever stop cynically using the iconography of World War Two as an excuse not to do the work of understanding each conflict in its singularity? I was disturbed by the way the storm troopers were slaughtered here. We are encouraged to cheer on the main characters as they murder dozens of faceless humans (probably teenagers drafted into service) with all sorts of aesthetic flourishes. Killing is fun! But sex? It has no place in Star Wars."
" We all know what's coming, but this film still delivers
",0.0,-0.9533,2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"So, any Star Wars fan can pretty much connect the dots in deducing what takes place in this film. It's literally right before the original Star Wars begins so it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.We're introduced to an ensemble of entirely new characters, half of which, you'll forget their names as soon as you finish the film. To give you an example, here's my roll-call of the main protagonists without consulting Google: Jyn, Cassien, K-2SO, Blind Jedi Follower, Buddy and Asian Machete.So Jyn Erso has more or less lived through her developing years as an outlaw. You could argue that there are many parallels between her and Rey from The Force Awakens, even down to a complete copy of the scene where she takes down a team of assailants single-handedly while the male sidekick looks on impressed.While this is officially Star Wars canon, it takes a couple of new approaches, such as not having a title crawl at the beginning, travelling to several new planets and captions describing the planets. Even the traditional John Williams score is nowhere to be heard.Despite all this, it's serviceable as a film. One distinction is that it is considerably more darker than the traditional Star Wars film. Their use of CGI is both impressive and questionable. Trying to portray characters previously played by deceased actors is tricky, so I was unsure what to make of CGI Peter Cushing as Governor Tarkin. I wouldn't have minded it as much if he was a recurring character but there are numerous scenes where he appears and every successive time he appears, the illusion gets more and more broken. The same can be said about CGI Leia at the end. I know that Carrie Fisher was still alive at the time this film was released but it's just something haunting about the glossiness of CGI Carrie Fisher circa 1977.The action in this film is amazing, especially the space battle; clearly a homage to Return of the Jedi. A number of unexpected cameos appear as well, which is a complete surprise. If there's one aspect that could be described as a weak link, it's the character chemistry. I know that these actors are good (hell, Felicity Jones was Oscar-nominated), but the overall delivery isn't quite to that same standard. For example, Jyn Erso sees a hologram of her father, whom she hasn't seen for about 10-15 years and starts crying her eyes out. She meets her father in a later scene as he dies. No tears, just ""Noooo!"" That didn't quite work for me.Also, no point getting emotionally invested because these characters all meet the same fate. K-2SO is probably one of favourite Star Wars characters now, though.This film also gave us the best Darth Vader scene ever, making me wish that we had more scenes to that degree.Overall, this film makes a great addition to the universe of Star Wars. However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has never seen a Star Wars film before, otherwise they would be completely lost."
" A Satisfying Spin-Off to the Saga!
",0.5093,-0.8506,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"This ""Star Wars"" spin-off tells one of the back stories to the fourth ""Star Wars"" episode, ""A New Hope."" It tells the story of the origins of the Death Star and of how the Rebellion acquired the plans to the Death Star. The film focuses on a group of characters who do not appear in any of the first six ""Star Wars"" films.This first ""Star Wars"" spin-off film had many things going for it. Unlike the previous year's ""The Force Awakens,"" this film had very little to prove, which meant that it was allowed to focus more on good storytelling. The media's emphasis on the regular episodes of the main ""Star Wars"" saga meant that far less about the plot of this film was divulged to the public. This movie featured more than one surprise, none of which will be disclosed here.Although this movie was a spin-off, it was every bit as engaging as the regular episodes of the ""Star Wars"" saga. The characters were interesting and likable. The film featured a nice mixture of humor and drama. The space battle sequence as well as many other visuals in the film were spectacular.While this film was not one of the episodes of the main saga, fans will undoubtedly find the film to be a very satisfying viewing experience. The characters engage the audience on an emotional level; and, the story is always exciting. It nicely fills the gap between episodes III and IV of the ""Star Wars"" saga. The film is highly recommended!"
" A Fantastic Chapter in the Star Wars Series!!!
",0.0,0.8938,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"Like most on opening weekend, I went into ""Rogue One"" fairly blind. It was known that the story took place in between Episodes III and IV, but the characters were all unknown. As such, there was a lot that I was unsure of. How would this fit into the chronology? Would it be a completely standalone film, with no connection to the other movies at all? That was pretty much how the previews made it out to be. That being said, as it turns out, ""Rogue One"" is the immediate prequel to Episode IV, the original Star Wars movie, ""A New Hope"". It absolutely is directly connected to that film, but tells its tale through a cast of characters that are mostly new (Vader and one imperial commander and a couple of reprisals of rebel leaders being the exceptions). And, the story and film are exceptional on the whole. The style is a bit more serious and gritty than the other episodes, and the first half of the film goes by a bit slow at times--but by end it gets very good!About the only drawback to this movie is its use of what I like to call the ""Bourne"" camera-work. At points the camera wobbles incessantly as figures are in battle. That was annoying, but not so much that it completely took away from the movie. And so, all things said, I have to give ""Rogue One"" 9/10 stars. It's fantastic, and falls just short of being a perfect ten. You definitely should see it!"
" 'Rogue One' goes all the way!
",0.0,0.9684,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"Since the release of 'The Force Awakens', Disney will be releasing a 'Star Wars' film every year for the foreseeable future. Well, it's been a year since 'The Force Awakens', which means it's time for another 'Star Wars' film, and luckily for us, we get 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'. I'm so glad that Disney is allowing up and coming, young filmmakers a chance to have a go at 'Star Wars', because director Gareth Edwards ('Monsters' and 'Godzilla') has knocked it out of the park, even though there were some re-shoots with writer Tony Gilroy ('Michael Clayton' and 'The Bourne' films). This is the 'Star Wars' film we have wanted for a long time, in that we get to see some characters do some truly amazing and badass things that we've never seen before, and a return to some of those classic set pieces and ships.'Rogue One' takes place in between 'Episode III' and 'Episode IV'. We all know that the original Star Wars film 'A New Hope' focused on Luke Skywalker destroying the Death Star, by way of stolen plans that Princess Leia entrusted to R2-D2 that instructed how to destroy that mega Death Star. We know how that turned out. 'Rogue One' tells the story of how and who stole those plans from the Empire and got them to the Rebellion. I don't want to give too much away here, because I know all of you will just fall in love with these characters.Every performance is excellent here from Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso to Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, and even Forest Whitaker as fan favorite Saw Gerrera. Everyone gives a great performance of characters struggling to overcome the empire and deal with their past losses. Alan Tudyk ('Firefly') voices the new droid K-2SO, which might be my new favorite 'Star Wars' character of the whole canon. K-2SO is just plain fantastic and funny in a way that C3PO could never be. It was a delight. Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn are just straight up phenomenal and have many layers to their characters and steal each scene they are in.Then of course Donnie Yen comes in and just owns every scene and proves he is the badass he has always been. There is a great story in this 133 minute film that keeps its pace with some of the best action sequences you'll ever see involving spaceships and tie fighters. Michael Giacchino has done a phenomenal job of bringing John Williams' score to this film by adding in some of the old with the new, and it just adds to every scene and suspenseful and heartfelt moment.'Rogue One' is definitely one of the best 'Star Wars' films I've seen.MUST-SEE!"
" The second most beautiful Star Wars film to date!
",0.1584,0.9943,2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Personally, Rogue One falls second to The Empire Strikes Back in my list of the best Star Wars films. This film was meant for the fans, but after watching it again, I feel anyone can enjoy the story without having seen a SW film. The various nods to both the original and prequel trilogies will make any fan jump with joy, but they're not crucial to the plot; so, again, as a standalone film, the average movie-goer will not be lost. The first half contains a great deal of exposition; with so many diverse characters to introduce, the film can't help but quickly and plainly explain what it needs to. The pace is rushed here and there and some issues solved effortlessly, but the story picks up as it goes. The third act is simply incredible. The love for the franchise becomes crystal-clear here. You can feel the film's eagerness to reach this point in the story and have fun, offering satisfying character/ story arcs. The action scenes, especially the space battles, are wonderfully shot, providing striking cinematography not seen (or fully enjoyed) in other SW films. I cannot praise the film's use of practical effects enough, and Rogue One ties-in flawlessly with A New Hope. It's a great time to be a Star Wars fan."
" Spectacular Film
",0.0,0.9949,2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Out of all the Star Wars movies made after the originals, Rogue One is without a doubt the greatest. Its nostalgic feel brings you just as close as you can get to the original trilogy, but unlike The Force Awakens(still an amazing movie but lacking in originality), you're presented with an entirely organic and fresh plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Not only is the plot refreshing, but the cast is as well. The diversity is truly worthy of special praise and admiration for anyone that enjoys seeing as many different types of racial representation on the movie screen as possible. I can honestly say that Rogue One was a special treat and an all around fantastic movie experience."
" Seriously, this was a good movie. Go see it – twice!
",0.3595,-0.9901,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-""Star Wars"" geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first ""Star Wars"" movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.One, this is the first Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and set it within the ""Star Wars"" universe.Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since ""Empire."" It wouldn't be ""Star Wars"" without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's ""Daredevil?"" (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a ""real"" war with ""real"" people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a ""Star Wars"" film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.Seriously, this was a good movie. Go see it – twice!"
" Gives me a new hope for the Star Wars franchise (pun intended)
",-0.1779,0.9917,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"I went into this movie with no expectations. Having been left utterly dismayed by the abysmal Episode VII (which I'm apparently in the minority in opinion) I was worried that this would also be a quick cash-grab for Disney. Instead, I was amazed by the leeway that this director was given and by the respect that he showed the original series given that this film is a prequel to Episode IV.The story - nothing too complex here but it's an entertaining story that pulls you in and keeps you interested to find out what happens next. The intro sequence felt a little forced (not sure what the mom was thinking when the storm troopers showed up). The first few scenes jump around a bit too much for my taste, they're meant to introduce characters quickly but it takes a few scenes with each of them before you start to get immersed in their world and struggles. Once the movie hits its pace the characters do a great job playing off of each other and making you care for them. Alan Tudyk's robot was the highlight of the character reel for me, and his jokes were well-timed and provided a welcome comic relief without being overbearing or forced (a la Jar Jar). Donnie Yen did a very strong job in his role as well with a few nice action scenes. His side-kick Wen Jiang also did a nice job in a supporting role. Felicity Jones did admirably as the lead. The ""main"" villain, a high up Imperial official was a little over-played and never felt very imposing. Diego Luna's character was just OK, I felt that some of his character development was forced (not necessarily the actor's fault on that).Pacing - the movie is fast paced and action focused and seemed to jump around a little too quickly. I think it could have used a few more slow character development scenes to break up some of the action. Being primarily an action movie this had its share of battle scenes and I was very happy to see someone finally do some homage to the original trilogy's great space battles. Donnie got a scene or two to show off his martial arts abilities, but it fit into the mythos well. All the ground battle scenes were typical star wars fare, but done well with some tense blaster fights.A few mixed bag items. The director used quite a few real sets, which I always appreciate and I think should be used more often than relying on CGI backgrounds as default (my personal preference there). However, while he did this for some of his backgrounds he decided that for some Episode IV characters he wanted to show in his movie he would just bring them back as fully CGI characters. Moff Tarkin is back as a fairly main character and very painful to see, it was a shame they couldn't have just done him as a hologram recording when needed as every time he came on scene I cringed. There's many ""easter eggs"" in the movie or overt references to things from the original trilogy. Some felt organic or at least humorously done (like two characters from the bar scene in episode IV), but then others felt forced like when the ""main"" villain reports to one of the higher ups because he wants credit for the death star being built.All in all, this is a wonderful homage to Star Wars and a worthy prequel to Episode IV. If you were scared that Disney would ruin star wars after seeing VII, then this should assure you that there may still be some gems to come out."
" Un-original :(
",-0.4404,-0.9435,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"With this movie not being an episode there was an opportunity to curate an original working title to add to the Star wars universe. I was very disappointed with the final cinema cut. At over 2 hours you would hope for some interesting deeper story lines not just providing context on previous events to ""A new hope"" but providing a further insight into the Star wars universe. Instead the first 30mins ticked by with little explanation (nor was it required) jumping between planets like a child learning how to Po go stick. This pace slowed as the film seemed to draw on inspiration from ""Interstellar's"" TARS and went into special effect overdrive similar to episodes 1-3. The fight scene logistics seemed particularly bad with plenty of repeat footage thrown in from all angles and the climax was predictable. Overall I was quite disappointed hence the midway rating."
" Awful, dire!
",-0.7424,-0.077,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"I so wished we had waited and got the DVD, that way at least I could have got up and walked away.3/4 of the film was seriously like watching paint dry. A lot of it just copied from previous and better ones, such as the mandatory bar full of a mix of strange folk from varying galaxies.The more entertaining parts, i.e. The last 20 minutes was then only passable. No mystery, no real suspense. The actors, well, a mix of old C rated actors, and young B-C rated actors. The whole thing obviously done on the cheap as not one real star was hired for this one. The cheapness showed. All in all, the worst of the entire series. I was yawning all the way through!"

The cast and crew who work on these productions come from all over the world. If national credit is to be given to promote a Star Wars film, FLAGS FROM ALL PARTICIPATING NATIONS should be revealed on screen. We need to take this opportunity to show Star Wars as a unifying force for creative and social good. This film was masterfully produced, directed, acted, edited, designed. Everyone who worked on this film should be proud of their extraordinary accomplishments."
" If you love STAR WARS you ought to hate this travesty.
",-0.8484,-0.9853,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Unlike the first 3 films, there is nothing original, nothing clever, nothing interesting here. Rather, they serve up a random re-hash of junk from the better movies. There is no all-for-one spirit, no real romance (and this isn't the fault of Felicity Jones or the young man, as they have virtually no dialog). Herein the dread Darth Vader does not hiss or look menacing, but simply waves to the crowd. The tall killing machines that look like camels don't enter the story until Empire Strikes Back. No matter. Here they are in the PRE-quil! The entire movie is just murdering white drones and spacecraft; pointlessly and without continuity. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION: If Star Wars fans not only accept this kind of garbage but literally praise it, more really bad Star Wars films will follow."
" A long time ago (but not quite as long ago as those pesky prequels)
",-0.296,0.9946,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"And lo, did Disney acquire the rights to arguably one of the most famous film franchises ever created (in this galaxy and all those before it). And, as everyone guessed, they began to milk it for all its worth. However, unlike the prequels, they did their best to appease everyone (i.e. the 'soft reboot' that was 'The Force Awakens'). However, along with what is technically the 'main' Star Wars story, they also decided to make one about just about everything from those little rodents you see briefly outside Jabba's palace, to why that Stormtrooper didn't see a door in front of him.And here we have 'Rogue One' – the tale we all know the end to about how the Rebels got their hands on the plans to the Death Star. So, if you've seen any previous Star Wars story, you basically know the end – which is technically a 'spoiler,' but never mind that. Despite us all knowing how it turns out, it's actually pretty fun.We join a young girl who has tenuous links to both the Rebels and the Empire and see her lead a band of misfits on a raid to steal and delivery the plans for the Death Star. And that's about it plot-wise. Like I say, if you've seen any of the others, you can probably guess how it all turns out. However, what's good about it is basically how well it ties the (depressing) prequels to the (excellent) originals. There are so many, not so much 'in-jokes,' but 'nods' to the original that only forty-year old fogies like myself will get. It's great to see all the faces who were in the original 'New Hope' film back here, even if some are a little 'CGI.' Rogue One in some ways is nothing new in as much as you know the story, however it is a worthy addition to the franchise due to it keeping with all the 'rules' of the universe (and not mentioning those 'midi-chlorines' or whatever they're called). Much of the talk surrounding the film centres on the use of computer graphics to restore dead actors (or 'un-age' them). I thought it was done pretty well, but there are those who say it's either disrespectful or just plain bad.But, whether you're a die-hard fan like myself, or a casual cinema-goer who can't name every single X-wing pilot in the battle of Yavin, you should enjoy this story as a fun, action-packed romp which is suitable for all the family (assuming you like action/sci-fi of course). Let's just hope all those other Disney rumours about 'prequels' and 'back-stories' live up to this one. My hopes aren't high for the 'Han Solo origin story.'"

" A new hope
",0.4404,0.963,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"What do we expect? Yet another StarWars installment, Disney's uptake on an eternal story, on a supposedly meaningful universe to tell infinite stories in. That's not the stuff of legend.With those expectations you certainly can't complain. Disney continues to nourish Star Wars back to health, adding some grim, dark side to this universe. It is a rather safe approach, using the biggest untold yet referenced mission the good old films had to offer. The characters are likable, the force is rescued from overuse and receives some mystic balm. Yet again RedLetterMedia delivered Disney's road map - not a bad thing. The cameos were a bit overdone and first get us into the film to then question the film's own comfort as a stand alone. All in all a job well done - no more and no less. The routinely qualities Disney brings in are exactly what Star Wars needed after George Lucas' debacle. However: it remains to be seen whether Disney allows innovation and growth. They do continue gathering the right ingredients to make it possible. Although it is necessary, even commendable, to cling to safety and stability for now the same concept would come down to morbid necromancy after half a dozen more films like this. They'll need courage and a keen eye later down the road, to allow Star Wars to actually change, to offer new stories in an old universe. For now it couldn't be any better. There is hope for the Jedi universe.Decent entertainment, professional through and through. Overall a good film and worth recommending to all the Star Wars fans out there. 7/10"
" Offensive rubbish
",-0.4588,-0.9873,2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I am 15 minutes in, and I find myself desperately longing for the atrocious prequels made by Lucas. That's how bad this movie is. It is boring, it has no sense of style whatsoever, it certainly doesn't feel like Star Wars, and the screen writing is abysmal. How do you make a Star Wars film that generates no thrills and fails to draw the viewers into the action in the first act? The original Star Wars started with a boom. It sucked you into the story instantly. Empire Strikes back made everyone amazed with the Hoth scenes, and hooked the audience from the start. Same thing with Return of the Jedi. These films all had memorable openings, with scenes and lines of dialogue true fans know by heart. Can anyone remember what happened in the opening of Rogue One? Will anyone pick any of these scenes and show them in film class or on TV as examples of memorable film making? No way in hell. I won't even say anything about the crap that followed later in the film, I have no more time to waste on this rubbish film.Zero stars."
" I expected it to be good and it was
",0.4404,0.9815,2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I grew up with the original trilogy and all the merchandise in the 80s, so I have lived and breathed Star Wars, it's a part of me and I know the originals inside out. In the 90s I was a young adult and interested in other things, so the second trilogy passed by quietly - altho I did see each film. I liked Force Awakens, it was a trip back to childhood and a well made Star Wars movie. Rogue One had my expectations high for a couple of reasons, #1 it being a new original Star Wars movie, but close #2 being the director Gareth Edwards. I absolutely loved his movie Monsters. Godzilla wasn't quite as good, but the atmosphere was there. I think Edwards has a great eye for cinematography, use of close ups in contrast to wide open spaces and great locations. He also clearly understands the need of drama and buildup and not going for straight up action. This was very clear in Monsters, which is basically a talkie, not much action there. Even Godzilla has relatively little action and a long build up, but the whole movie didn't work quite as well as Monsters.Rogue One looks amazing, everything is spot on. Cinematography, locations, fx, the cast and how they look. It was great seeing men with sideburns and vanishing hair, it was of course obvious to style them according to the first Star Wars movie made in the late 70's for continuity, but it was very well done. The cast doesn't look like they are superstars, they look real and gritty.The story works. In the beginning the movie moves quickly from one place to another, but it sticks together quite well. It's basically quite a straight forward movie, even to a point of being maybe a tad too long for what it has to tell. I was surprised how much this movie mirrors todays conflicts in middle east and the fact that it clearly takes the terrorist point of view. I'm also quite surprised how easily people have accepted this or not seen the connection. There is even a holy city by the name of Jedha and there is a real city of Jeddah close to Mecca. It really is not that far fetched to see rebels as extremist terrorists and empire as the ""world police"".Acting is good. While Felicity Jones' portrayal of Jyn Erso is not quite as interesting as it could be, I'd say Cassian Andor by Diego Luna is a well written and portrayed character. I also liked Ben Mendelsohn's Krennic as the villain, very well acted. K-2SO as the C3PO style comic relief works perfectly, this is really a perfect example of a well done comic relief. The rest of the cast - while quite big - are all good and interesting, well portrayed characters.Actions scenes are amazingly done, even tho I'm not a huge fan of action, but here it works.After the amazing use of music for atmosphere in Monsters, I was slightly disappointed with the soundtrack in Rogue One. The John Williams connection is there, the original themes when ever Vader or a familiar character is on screen, but the rest of the themes are a bit so-so. There are variations of the original themes, which made me think ""that's not how it's supposed to go"", slightly distracting. And the themes didn't feel emotionally that fitting. I understand you can't go with an electronic soundtrack for a Star Wars movie, but I may have tried a bit different themes and orchestrations for a movie like this.All in all highly recommended. Stands on it's own, but there are spine tingling moments for Star Wars fans, especially in the end. While Force Awakens was a bit of a pastiche of the originals, this one takes it's own approach for most part. It's more of a sci-fi war drama, but with a proper dose of Star Wars we know and love."
" Better than the last SW
",0.4404,0.957,2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"I like that this had a story rather than just a reboot! The story is book-ended by the original Star Wars, re titled a new hope. The story moves at a slower pace than I would have liked. Fell asleep twice near the same spots because it was slow, and the scene was dark for the prolonged night scenes. Did wake up in time to see the ending, with the actions and daylight views. Am I the few that noticed both the last two pictures were dominated by female heroine? More for girl power! They did bring back a few characters from the original Star Wars, so best to know who the original stars are. I guess they used a lot of cgi, or else those actors did not age much over 30+ years ago. I hear Disney plans to release one movie a year to recoup the expenses to buy out George, this is a better effort but I cannot see the franchise make mega bucks for the next one unless the story and special effects improve. Who wants to watch another remake?"

It avoids whimsy, and for the second time in a row features a strong (but still rather delightful) female lead. Last time it was the estimable Daisy Ridley; this time the even more estimable Felicity Jones. How on earth as an actor do you move from Stephen Hawking's long-suffering wife in academia to being an action hero (with the small matter of dying of cancer in A Monster Calls somewhere in the process)? She did it. She is clearly made of tougher stuff than her sweet diffident English appearance seems to show. Altogether this film demonstrates one of the reasons why movies need making - drama, excitement, action, and at the heart of it, a real person that can be identified with and/or admired."

First time watching I didn't notice that Tarkin was CGI, and that should give an insight in just how good the visual effects were.One of the things I appreciate most about this movie is that it avoids the typical cliché many Hollywood movies have, especially the ending. It is everything I wanted it to be without any unnecessary nonsense.The screenplay is very well written, the characters are interesting and dynamic, the story is intriguing, and it is not only loyal to the previous movies, it also ties-in them in a beautiful way.With that being said, this is now on the top of my favorite Star Wars movies list.

",0.7925,0.9702,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"This film certainly puts the WAR in Star Wars! Action is not something lacking in Rogue One. In fact in some ways there's SO much action that the characters back stories do suffer a little from it.That being said its a really enjoyable movie and wastes no time at all in getting to the action and the main plot points. The characters are well written and sufficiently complex enough to do the story justice. However there are parts where you feel there should have been more done to flesh the characters out a little so you care a little more about their struggle in the long run.For fans of old-school Star Wars though there are plenty of moments that will have you grinning from ear to ear! From the return of classic ships and vehicles to some very unexpected but welcome cameos. (Not the ones getting the most press I might add.)Like The Force Awakens it really benefits from a physical and hands on film-making style. It definitely expands and builds upon many things we first saw in A New Hope all those years ago and since watching Rogue One a re-visit to Episode IV now seems to give many scenes and occurrences within that movie take on a more intriguing and deeper meaning.It has its faults however I was willing to let those little niggles slide simply because this was one roller-coaster ride of a movie! (Especially the last third of the story.) Hopefully with the success of Rogue One Lucasfilm will go ahead now and make more ""Star Wars Story"" movies that give die-hard fans like myself more of an insight into this vast and rich galaxy of heroes, rogues and villains."

I would watch any movie with star wars on it even if i knew before hand that it is crappy and i think a lot of ppl feel the same way. With that being said, for the very first time in over 2 decades i was walking out of a star wars flick with a smile on my face cause the movie was great. Not because of nostalgia/childhood memories but because rogue one was actually decent. Rogue one was done for the adult fan base and not as a platform to sell toys and other merchs. This is the right direction for up coming star wars movies and i hope to see more of it.So grab a ticket and have the experience, you wont be disappointed."

Let me start by saying this film is a great war film. Its dark, its gritty, and its depressing. As for special effects they are awesome(as usual in a star wars movie). Gareth Edwards has proved that he does an excellent job at making things huge. I saw the death star in this movie and remember saying ""dame that's huge""! The cast does a good job as well. And i saved the best for last, the action scenes. Oh my god, they are amazing. You got ground troops fighting each other, You got an astounding space battle, And you got rebels fighting huge at-ats. As for the cons this movie doesn't do to well in the begging. The film wants you to accept these new characters in a very rushed manner. I wouldent say the characters are disposable, more like not as memorable. So in the end Rogue one has a slow start with a few character problems, but it then builds to an epic 2nd and 3rd act that makes all of those flaws seem very forgettable. 9/10 *2nd favorite movie of 2016"
" An enjoyable film with a zombie in one of the leading roles.
",0.4404,0.6544,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Back in 1977, Peter Cushing starred as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original ""Star Wars"" movie. ""Rogue One"" is set in the Star Wars world just before ""Star Wars"" and the studio decided to have Tarkin as one of the major characters, even though Cushing died in 1994. So instead of re-casting him, they did something that only modern technology could allow them to do--create a CG Tarkin that actually looks and sounds like Cushing!! It really is amazing and lifelike and for this reason alone, it's worth seeing the film. Now I pray that this sort of thing does not become the norm. Think about it...they COULD start making new films starring Clark Gable with Jennifer Lawrence or The Three Stooges and John Gielgud using CG-- it's getting THAT good!As for the movie, it's NOT as wonderful and perfect as many of my friends have said nor is it a bad film in any way. Instead of recapitulating the plot, I'll just say what makes this movie different from most Star Wars films. This is NOT a cutesy film. Aside from a tiny appearance by R2D2 and C3PO, the characters, including the droid, are not designed with cuteness and marketability towards children in mind. I really appreciate this-- and thank God there is no Jar-Jar!! Additionally, unlike the previous films this one is a downer with an ending where pert near everyone dies! I mention this because I would NOT advise folks with very young kids to bring them to see it.Overall, it's a well made film with a lot to recommend it. My only gripe is that you KNOW what will happen because it is a gap-filler and the audiences already know what must happen in the next film. I might be inclined to say more, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this blockbuster...so I'll end it here."

Thats not as controversial as it sounds obviously he's God to Star Wars fans but in my opinion The Force awakens ( which he didn't like ) was the best Star Wars film so far ( on par with the first film directed by the man himself from 1977 which is now the fourth film due to the substandard films George Lucas cashed in on with episodes 1-3 ) in terms of enjoyment and couldn't have been better . Rogue one was great but it could have been better , the first hour was quite laboured , the final hour made up for it and was brilliant . Felicity Jones and Forest Whitaker stood out as the stars ,there were some blink twice moments with deceased actors brought back to life by cgi , leaving you wondering where Hollywood could go next ? Can they now make a compete film with deceased actors thus saving on fees ? This has been a box office phenomenon with $900m being taken in on a $200m budget already . A very sensible investment by Disney and the first two films they've produced have been crowd pleasers too.Star Wars purists will enjoy it as well people completely new to franchise . Looking forward to the next one.RiP Carrie Fisher"
" Why did I fall asleep?
",0.0,-0.4333,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"I can't give a movie a high score when it has this effect on me. I asked my young friend what he thought, and he said the film had him on the edge of his seat. Surprising, because I was doing my best to turn my seat into a reclining bed. But why did I have this reaction? I saw the first SW in the theatre decades ago, and I've seen most of the movies since. Without being a SW geeks, I have as many viewing hours invested in the Star Wars universe as the next guy. But to be honest, I'm just not that interested in it. A lot of it is confusing to me now. It isn't intellectually exciting.Everything in, and about, this movie seemed artificial to me. None of it felt natural.I wasn't engaged with the characters at all. There was absolutely zilch in this movie to move me. I want emotional engagement, and this movie failed to deliver. Child separated from her family. Nothing. Young woman reunites with dying father. Nothing.There was just nothing new in this movie. It lacked originality. I felt like I had seen it all before. Am I too jaded for this film? Although I keep going to fast-paced action films, I'm not particularly into them. I dislike movies with hardware, explosions, gun fights and chases. This movie was all about that. Annoyingly, the theatre was full and I went to the movie with a friend who was sitting beside me. I couldn't play on my phone during the chases and shootouts.How is it possible that this movie has done so well in the box office? What phenomenon am I missing? I suppose action-craving boys and young men are most of the voters on IMDb. I think maybe I'm just in the wrong demographic. But even many of the critics like this one though. What did they see in it??Strangely, I loved Passenger and Arrival -- two movies that are not as well received as this one. It boils down to me disliking the action element. I wonder if this has to do with me never having played video games. If I remember correctly I think I had pretty well the same reaction to the previous SW movie."
" The best SW movie since Return of the Jedi
",0.6369,0.9934,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Watch out, there are some heavy spoilers ahead!After I've seen the episode VII (basically garbage), I've almost gave up seeing any other new Star Wars movie. But based on the recommendation by a co-worker, I gave this one a try and boy was I pleasantly surprised! Rogue One has everything the other post episode VI attempts lacked. It's original, but not overdone. It's intense, unpredictable and holds this delicate touch of surprise. The funny character (K-2SO) is witty, yet not annoying. And its finale might be even compared to some of the original SW episodes, also with a connection to the beginning of the episode IV. so fluent and fitting, the other new SW films can only dream about. There were some cringe-worthy moments, like the cliché and somewhat chaotic start of the movie, which eventually moved along into very nice cinematic experience though and there's also the much debated CGI characters of Tarkin and princess Leia. While the later mentioned was done much better (has also just about 2 seconds of screen appearance), Tarkin's face has this classical ""CGI look"" of a computer game character and in my opinion the effort of bringing the original character didn't add up the desired value for the whole picture. Apart from that, Rogue One is a great Star Wars film and restored my faith in the force. ;)"
" Great movie, re-energized my love of SW after disappointing #7
",0.7269,0.984,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Some light spoilers.I had very low expectations going into RO, because I felt horribly let down by #7. Sure it hit some buttons in the sense that the universe was there, some familiar faces (and ships) were present, but there was too much humour, it felt like #4 re-imagined, the plot lacked cohesion, (parts of it, like the planet sapping the suns was just laughable), emo villain (Khylo Ren) wasn't impressive, and a weak, semi-hysterical heroine who runs off into the forest when she discovers something difficult was disappointing.I almost didn't go to SEE Rogue One, because after 1-3 and 7, I couldn't take any more disappointment. I LOVE Star Wars, it was a seminal series for me with lots of attachments and importance, and I couldn't take another battering by it. I love space and science fiction, and Star Wars grabbed the love I had of that genre and made it alive in front of my eyes. I am grateful for that.My boyfriend's company had extra tickets for RO however and I went. At first I was confused a little - the story line comes together in pieces in the beginning, jumping from a remote planet to a prison to a mining colony, etc - but slowly the shape takes form.Jyn is a terrific character; she tries desperately to hold what is happening at bay, because as she says to Saw, her former father figure, ""all this has brought me is pain"", and it's believable. But when confronted with a message from her real father Galen and what is going on she becomes a dedicated fighter, willing to sacrifice anything to stop the empire and make Galen's sacrifice mean something.I loved the characters - from Bodhi, the cautious rebel who fully embraces the Alliance, to Churrit, the almost naively faithful guardian of the Jedi temple. The danger and urgency seem real - something 7 was lacking for me - and Cassian is a great character; a man hard from years of fighting the Empire who softens yet stays true to his principles.The locations are great - from Scarif, the Empire's repository of plans to Yavin 4, faithfully reproduced as the rebel base, to Jedha, the site of a Jedi temple. I loved how everything isn't all spelled out - you know for instance what Jyn has is Khyber around her neck without being told, and you are left to wonder a bit how Bodhi really came to want to help to alliance; whether it was mostly because of the rape of Jedha, his homeworld, his admiration for Galen, or even more than that.K-2SO, voice acted by Alan Tudyk, provides a few light moments in a story that feels urgent, deadly serious. The last 45 minutes or so, when the rebels decide to join the fight on Scarif whilst Rogue One is trying to steal the plans is amazing. I saw this movie in both Real 3D and IMAX, and it is stunning in both. It has some of the best space fighting and cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars movie.When I first heard Peter Cushing's voice, I was surprised - I knew he had died years ago. His CGI is better than Carrie Fisher's at the end, FWIW. Tarkin is as creepy and loathsome as you remember him, and I am glad he was able to be included here, as he is key to the continuity and it segues into Star Wars: A New Hope.The movie for me, however, wasn't without flaws. When General Dravin tells Cassian to kill Galen rather than capture him, it seemed ill advised - after all, the station is operational and Galen could be the only person to provide information on it to the rebellion. I do admit a capture operation is a bit more involved and perhaps Draven didn't want to sacrifice the forces necessary for it. Also Tarkin destroyed the repository on Scarif, which I also thought wasn't very reasonable. I don't believe he was certain about the status of any upload and the records for the ENTIRE empire were stored there. A huge loss, I would think, and if the Death Star is so impregnable as Tarkin seems to believe, then why worry even if they DID get the plans for the Death Star? Then I realised there might be another consideration - Tarkin knew that Director Krennick was on Scarif, and could have also been getting rid of a thorn in his side.Despite these few questions, I think the movie is excellent and holds up well - perhaps better - after a few showings, when you have a bit of an orientation and you can enjoy the smaller details, drink in the battles."
" Not a fresh moment in it
",-0.2411,0.7396,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"If you've seen previous Star Wars films-- almost any of them-- then you've seen this movie. The premise is rather fun: it's a prequel to the original 1977 film, ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" detailing how rebels acquire the plans to the Death Star that Princess Leia delivers to R2D2, and ultimately to Obi Wan Kenobi, in Episode IV. Unfortunately, the two plots-- this movie and Episode IV-- are virtually identical. In both, rebels plan and execute an invasion of an Empire stronghold. Little effort is made to enliven that old plot with fresh ideas, fresh humor, fresh anything.Several actors from the 1977 original are digitized in (Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher), and Darth Vader shows up (James Earl Jones' voice), and I don't expect or want anything new from them. But the rest of the characters are just rehashes of previous ones. We've seen them before. The generic Zen character (Donnie Yen) is part Yoda, part Obi-Wan. The robot K2SO is part Wookie, part C3P0. Bad guy Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelssohn) is Darth Vader but in a white cloak. Jyn (Felicity Jones) and Cassian (Diego Luna) are basically the same character. They're fine actors, but one does wish for the occasional change of pace, even if its just a different facial expression.I wish I could recommend it. It's not an embarrassing disaster like ""Phantom Menace"" or ""Revenge of the Sith,"" it's just boring."
" Not too bad but nowhere near Lucas own films
",0.2323,0.8799,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Well, it was not as bad as Force Awakens, it was quite watchable. However, I agree with all those who say that this film has not recreated the original magic in the films written, directed or at least produced by George Lucas himself. Whoever makes the film puts the stamp of their mind and imagination on it and neither of two films made by Disney has the feel and magic of George Lucas Star Wars world. In spite of any flaws that Lucas films had, he created a huge gallery of very interesting, unique, memorable characters and different worlds in universe. His films were always full of surprises. It was easy to remember all the main characters. Both in Force Awakens and Rogue one we have a bunch of greasy looking fellows, and they always come in a big pile and are hard to remember as most of them are quite boring. A lot of places in the universe look too much like Earth. Rogue one was definitely better and more intelligent out of the two made by Disney, but still, it had too much confusing, all-the-same looking action, predictable and clichéd storyline. Still, it was OK to watch at Saturday evening."
" Attack of the B Team

But it's the bestest ever Star Wars movie because DIVERSITY! - except all the main bad guys are white males.But there's a cool warrior monk! He says this mantra abut the force, ""allowing him to have full use of his senses and makes his blindness a non-issue"". That is, until he has to pull a switch. Then he flails around just like I would if I had my eyes closed.The whole Rogue One team dies - each one either while taking pivotal actions to save the mission, or just after taking pivotal actions to save the mission.A Disney big franchise movie can't miss the opportunity to re-imagine scenes from older Star Wars movies. So this has a re-imagining of the star destroyer flying into another one. It has a re-imagining of Luke facing the fiend who killed his father - the young heroine faces the middle manager who killed her mother.""I have a bad feeling about this..."" goes to the re-programmed imperial droid. But the ""this"" is cut off. It's supposed to be funny, and it is a nod at the re-imagining going on in the Disney SW Universe. We don't need the old clichés because we have diversity.There is a meaningless cameo from R2D2 and C3PO. CGI Leia has a more meaningful scene. CGI Tarkin holds his own in a few longer scenes.There aren't meaningful character arcs. People go from one thing to another without any motivation in between. There are character moments. That's better than nothing.The movie isn't bad. But it's nothing special."

The plot was good but not seamless (But that's how Star Wars always is). I bought into the romance and was glad that it was not overkill. I like how the writers seized this opportunity to make a movie that wasn't about Skywalkers, Jedi, and Sith and brought in some interesting characters. They even dove into some other aspects of the force. They also touched on some gray areas of war (it is Star WARS after all). Obviously it was super cool to see the plot line up with A New Hope the way that it did.The music was great, the shots were great, the acting was decent. 10/10 absolutely loved the film."
" Rogue One proves Star Wars is in good hands.
",-0.1779,-0.3602,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Audiences returned to Star Wars with Abrams' entertaining if unoriginal The Force Awakens. Gareth Edwards reminds audiences why we love Star Wars in the first place with his dark and exciting installment ROGUE ONE.The film presents us with the Rebel Alliance in full swing against the insidious Galactic Empire which is rumored to be building a doomsday weapon, described in whispers as a planet killer. They plan to contact or preferably kill the machine's creator by hiring his daughter Jyn Erso to track him down. Jyn Erso (Jones) is outfitted with a motley crew of killers, spies, saboteurs, and one very snarky but bad-ass droid (Tudyk). They are met with resistance from skeptical rebels, persistent storm-troopers, Imperial assassins, and Darth Vader himself! ROGUE ONE is not just a space opera but it is also a wartime adventure film. The ground battles, dog fights, and duels are all staged splendidly. Those felt short-changed by the more comedic action in 'The Force Awakens' will be pleased by the gripping and often dirty shootouts and skirmishes. Darth Vader himself gets in on the action in a short but fantastic sequence.As an ensemble action film, ROGUE ONE works in making its ragtag cast of rough-n-ready characters memorable, granted even if I don't remember their names. I at least know their personalities. Felicity Jones' posh accent might be off at first but she proves a resourceful and relatable protagonist. Her counterpart Cassian (Diego Luna) is a tad darker in attitude but no less heroic. Alan Tudyk is the stand-out as the burly but wisecracking droid K-2SO. Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed, and Donnie Yen demonstrate how the Rebel Alliance (and in a greater sense bravery) can arise from any person. Ben Mendelsohn is a different kind of Star Wars villain, the pompous prick of a bureaucrat who is smarmy enough to curry favor with Darth Vader.The first half of ROGUE ONE is a tense spy thriller and by the third act, it's a full blown war epic. It's arguably the best action that we've seen in a Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. Although ROGUE ONE is a more brooding picture, there's still humor, heroics, and more importantly hope to be had in the movie. Especially with the closing shot."
" Okay for a regular movie but not for a Star Wars film
",0.6526,-0.8393,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"I'm not gonna lie. This movie is kind of bad. The only good part of it was getting to see Felicity Jones' nice body. Other than that, this was a pretty bad movie. I actually had a hard time staying awake during this one. This movie is not representative of the Star Wars franchise and for a Star Wars film, this kind of sucks. Here comes the spoilers. There are no light saber fights in this film. No jedi vs. sith. Every Star Wars film has at least 2 of these but this film didn't have none. It's all blasters. To be fair, this was an okay movie. That being said, this movie sucks in comparison to the other Star Wars films. It's an okay movie. It's just not that good"
" Rogue Suicide Mission
",-0.6705,0.9314,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"The apparent purpose of ""Rogue One"" was to answer the question: ""How did Princess Leia obtain the plans to the Death Star?"" And, it was a very near thing. Generally, the movie may be complimented for the acting of all the principals, the action sequences and the visual effects. It was especially nice to hear the voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader.Otherwise, I found it to be a dark and depressing movie. (Was it an anti-war film in disguise?) But, I guess that is the formula for today's blockbuster Sci-Fi movie. Put the characters through hell with no real payoff in terms of their own relationships. You wanted a Leia-Hans type romance? Forget it. Where is the emotional payoff for the fan who goes to a movie to be entertained? What made the script writers decide to kill every member of the Rogue team? I suppose that precludes a sequel. Think about it. Even some of the Dirty Dozen survived, but not this movie. In fact, for the principal characters, they couldn't even be assured that their mission was ultimately successful. The final scene with Princess Leia was designed to end the movie where ""A New Hope"" begins, but it was not enough for me to be satisfied with the ending. As a side note, the CGI appearance of Leia was not well done in my view. Only consider the younger face of Michael Douglas used in the ""Ant Man"" movie, which was outstanding. The CGI Leia dubbed over the face of Ingvild Deila was not as lean and youthful in appearance as the young Carrie Fisher in the original movie, so it was not as believable as the face of Peter Cushing placed on Guy Henry. The writers no doubt wanted to create something meaningful to add to the Star Wars canon, but ultimately created a product that is irrelevant to that canon. This was one of those movies that I can say, ""It was okay, but I don't care if I see it again."" I'm not even motivated to buy the DVD when it comes out."
" Dour
",0.0,0.9885,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"A lot of my facebook friends were declaring this the best movie in the Star Wars series, so I was surprised when I saw on metacritic that critical reviews were mixed. But now I understand. Even the reviews of my girlfriend and myself were mixed; while she really liked this film, it left me cold.Rogue One is a surprisingly dour movie for a series that usually embraces a fun aesthetic. The empire and rebel leaders are almost equally unlikable, and the story is a grim slog.While my girlfriend spent the movie planning her Jyn Halloween costume, I found the character fairly bland; far less interesting than Force Awakens Rey or the original's Leia (or even, for that matter, Phantom Menace's princess). I cared for the rebel soldier in charge of the mission even less.The best characters were easily the blind Chirrut and K-2SO. These two characters had the humor and heart I expect from Star Wars characters.The basic idea of building a movie around something briefly mentioned in the original movie is a good one, and the story is pretty solid. But I never felt invested in the characters and little of the action actually excited me.I don't understand anyone who claims this is the best movie in the series. Even my girlfriend wouldn't go that far. For me it was a huge disappointment."
" Rouge one is lit
",0.0,0.9919,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,Rouge one is the best Star Wars movie ever!!! I really loved every moment of it! I honestly don't understand how anyone could dislike it!!! At the beginning I thought how good can a spin off really be but let me just say WOW it really blew my mind. The light saber scene was amazing. probably the best light saber scene in any Star Wars movie. Also all CGI was just great. Crazy how CGI has changed the film industry. It was a 100% all-round amazing produced and directed movie. I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy a movie again like I did this one. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet should jump in their car immediately and drive to the nearest IMAX to watch it! Grab some snack and just enjoy 2h 13m of pure magic. Disney really is killin' it!
" The Prequel That Should Have Been
",0.0,0.9932,2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"""Rogue One"" is somewhat an anomaly; it's the first non-Episode Star Wars film, set before the events of the original 1977 film, that is meant to show what led up to those events occurring, portraying the mission to retrieve the Death Star plans. The question is, does it live up to what it sets out to accomplish? In my opinion, yes, with a few issues along the way.One of the things this movie gets right is how much it ties into the Star Wars Universe. You have characters from both the prequel and original trilogy showing up here in the form of cameos or even as main plot devices. While some of these additions can feel forced at times, I would not have taken any of them away, and it reminds how connected this film is to the others.I also enjoyed, for the most part, the new characters. Felicity Jones does a good job as Jyn Erso and carries the movie well. We get to know a great deal about her backstory and the connection with her father (played by the always awesome Mads Mikkelson), which plays a huge role in the film. Diego Luna does a good job in the supporting character role, and his characters shows you a different side to the rebellion that we haven't seen before. Alan Tudyk is great as the comic-relief robot K-2SO, and Donnie Yen is great as Chirrut Imwe, who was a cool, almost Jedi-like character (he's not, in case anyone is wondering).The action is intense and fast paced, particularly in the film's final act, which is outstanding. You feel the intensity of every moment and the grittiness of the war that is going on. I'm not sure I would go with those who are saying that is a totally dark movie, but the film does end on a very bittersweet note that actually packed a lot of emotion within it. Visually, the film is also stunning, with most of the visual effects exceeding. Again, I love that they are using both practical and visual effects, something I look forward to see more of in the future.The film also does something that most prequels (including the Star Wars ones) fail to accomplish: it adds to the original. It fixes plot holes that were found in the original, but it also adds weight to the events found in A New Hope. You understand the gravity of this situation, how important it was and how much sacrifice went into it. It's nice to see this film accomplish that.And then of course we have to talk about Darth Vader, who plays a small but significant role in the film. This is the first time in the history of Star Wars that I was truly afraid of what Darth Vader could do. He's not in the film much, but nonetheless this is some of the best we've ever seen from the character, making you forget about the whiny Anakin from the prequels.Of course with any movie, there are flaws, and Rogue One's problems mainly have to do with its story, the character development in particular. There are some characters who were fleshed out fine (Jyn, Cassian, etc.), but then there were others where you didn't really get to learn the motivation behind their actions. I would have liked to have learned more about some of them. I also felt like the story, while overall consistent and well-written, was edited together very oddly. In the beginning of the film, we jumped from several different moments within the span of a couple of minutes. This may be due to the re-shoots that occurred a few months before this film's release, but still, it did feel like it could have been done better.Also, as good as the visual effects were in this film, there was a case of motion capture that I felt didn't work. I won't reveal which character they recreate, but anytime that character was on screen, it took me out of the movie. Sometimes it looked fine, mostly when the character was standing still, but whenever we saw their mouth move or their facial features, it reminded me of a video game. Another time it was used for a different character and it looked really good, but still, I think the motion capture could have been worked on a bit better.However, despite my problems with the movie, ""Rogue One"" is a phenomenal addition to the Star Wars universe and is, in many ways, the prequel that should have been. This is what many people, including myself, wish the Star Wars prequels had been, because not only does it connect the dots between films, it also adds weight and importance to the events of the original Star Wars. It may not be perfect, but with this film, Lucasfilm continues to prove that Star Wars is back and better than it has been in a while."

It looks like Disney doesn't think this movie is ""real Star Wars"", but they should sack Abrams and all the embarrassing things he did out of the canon and give the franchise to Gareth Edwards. This guy KNOWS what Star Wars is about.The other thing I didn't like is the music. Really, really sloppy work trying to look like Williams and actually destroying his amazing compositions.

" Better than The Force Awakens
",0.4404,-0.4247,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Last year's disaster of a Star Wars movie (TFA) left me angry and disappointed. I thought I would never like any of the new films. Rogue One is not great but I generally enjoyed watching it.I cannot help but drawing a parallel between both. Rogue One is done with a different twist: it is more like a good war drama, rather than being a western-style sci-fi picture. What I find annoying about it is the choice of Diego Luna for the main character. While he is a fine actor, I am not sure who decided that he could be a convincing bad ass member of the Rebellion. He was equally as ridiculous as Adam Driver playing Kylo Ren in TFA. The rest of the cast did a good job. Felicity Jones was much better than the actress (or is she a female soccer goalkeeper?) playing Rey in the previously released movie.The other parts that could have been done better: the dialog (and monologues for that matter). Too much explaining of what is happening and why, instead of showing it. This is a movie after all, not a radio play. And where was The Force? They kept talking about it but it was not given a chance to show itself...The story was quite boring as well but I guess it is not easy to right a good Star Wars script."
" Provides depth and feeling to the Star Wars universe
",-0.4767,-0.8681,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"In this understated tale from a galaxy far, far, away, we follow the daughter of a rebellious Imperial scientist who has masterminded the one fatal flaw of the deathstar, named Galen Erso. Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) is a despondent pawn in the fight against the empire. After becoming all but orphaned as a child by the war, the film finds her many years later; her self-destructive path has led to her arrest but, due to her connections with an extremist rebel, she is 'rescued' by 'The Alliance'. We then follow her and a group of unlikely heroes who battle their way to an imperial stronghold, eventually retrieving the blueprints that set the scene for the original trilogy. The film's title is its mantra. It is the Rogue One of the family and stands apart from its flashy cousins, almost as an independent film about rebellion that just happens to be set in the star wars universe. I think what I enjoyed most about this addition to the star wars franchise, is that it has unearthed the nuanced and slightly dejected characters that have to live out their existence in the post-jedi universe. It has, unintentionally or not, shone a mirror to the real-life struggles that overlooked and disparate individuals of political upheaval today must feel. The film barely sets the scene before darting dizzingly from planet to planet, only pausing for brief moments of slick action and to piece together the motley crew that will take on the empire. The worlds they visit are very much alive and distinct, from the origins of the force in Jedha to where it now resides in the hellish, volcanic home base of Darth Vader. The action, being on a smaller scale for the majority of the film, is gritty and visceral. The final battle brings to the fore images of Dunkirk.At a 133 minutes long, however, the cast still don't get the screen time they need in order to connect with the story or to each-other and, sadly, in this regard the characters in Rogue One are underdeveloped. With Captain Andor (Diego Luna) slightly boring in moments and the defecting pilot played by the underutilised Riz Ahmed. I would have appreciated slightly better character development in the first half, even though the second half brings what is left together very nicely. The cast being so large, none get to truly find their feet, even the father-daughter driving force of Galen and Jyn can sometimes seem hollow; with all the forced nicknames that come with it. However, the additions of the blind muttering monk and his admiral aimbot sidekick do fill their role nicely. Old favourites pop-up in sometimes forced ways, but I try to remember that this film has its heart in the right place. It is not The Force Unleashed, it is for the fans. Considering the wealth of characters, the writing does not let itself be watered down. It provides a compelling narrative with characters wrestling with themes of self-doubt; whether, in this rebellion, the end can ever justify the blood soaked means. In Rogue One's portrayal of a darker, meaningful Star Wars universe - this film triumphs. The dialogue and themes underpinning the film are surprisingly forceful (heh). It is a success in providing the much needed depth to this universe, and provides hope for future spin-offs that can stay true to the grass-roots."

",0.7003,0.9973,2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I've always been someone that went to see a film I wanted to see at the cinema, after the buzz had died down, when the seats were more empty and I had the space to take that film in more. It hasn't changed.I grew up on re-runs of the original trilogy and I loved them. Then in my 20s I saw the three new prequel films which were fun, less dark and seemed benign of any real classic moments (save the fight between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-One Kenobi - which in all honesty was brilliant, the birthing of Darth Vader and death of Anakin which should have been far more, was completely cringe-worthy). Quite a different set of films to the original trilogy but had their own merits. By no means classics though that Empire was or A New hope. Still, seeing the original films, I remembered how I felt as a kid towards all of it, it was a universe I very much wanted to be a part of and watching them, I did for the brief hour or two, it attracted me to play the old X-Wing games on my older brothers PC (when he was out!).I then, in my 30s, went to see The Force Awakens which, it tipped the proverbial hat a few times in acknowledgement to the other films and was somewhat respectful, it was still a very different film to any of the other six and I can only compare it to this decades set of Super Hero films in how it was directed, built up and let down. Still, it was better then the prequels, full of action and romanticised some of the old characters in how they were brought back into it. If this film was a torpedo aiming for an exhaust port 2 meters wide, it missed, by a good foot or so but a try none the less.Then, when it seemed all hope was lost by many including me. This film, really... was... a new hope. I could only complain that it was too fast paced for some characters to develop but other than that, it is gold, truly in line with the A New Hope, as it needed to be. Everything felt fitting for the whole universe and whilst I do agree Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher were not spot-on recreations of themselves, they were pretty flawless. This film made me feel like a kid again in all kinds of senses, the rushes of the alliance and even the appearances of a matured, menacing Darth Vader (yes, its James Earl Jones!). The main heroes and villains play their part but its important to remember this is a spin off film so I think its fair to understand why they are not developed too much but enough to warrant their places. This film made me tear up several times not just for nostalgia but it just felt right, the space battle scenes were perfect as were the various land battle. The environments, the characters, the Death star, the original Star Destroyers, all of them exactly in keeping with the original universe (now the time line is neigh on the same as the New Hope, I suppose that was obvious to expect).As you can tell, I really liked it. I wish the main villain and heroine in this film had more development or were just a little more memorable to set this film more on this own than just a add on to a legacy but I still rate it as 10. Star Wars needed a real comeback film and this was very much it."
" A Standalone But Autochthonous Rebellion
",-0.1901,0.9291,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Ten years after the terminal insertion into film cosmos begot by George Lucas (""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" in 2005), settled down the first usufruct of Disney's shrewd acquisition when it purchased Lucasfilm—studio which is interpreted as the most remarkable franchise in pecuniary terms—by a reasonable value (USD $4 billion). ""The Force Awakens"" was the channel Abrams applied to flourish the torpid force in the warsies' heart after the futile prequels. Starting with this one, Disney took it upon itself to purvey an annual movie within litigating film release schedule. Kathleen Kennedy (co- founder of Amblin Entertainment and current President of Lucasfilm) and formidable crew of the factory covet with making an empirical universe about the preternatural galaxy far, far away; and to achieve this, they have concluded to try its luck with Edwards' war experiment in order to elucidate whether it is beneficial to create a line of independent events out of the Skywalker family. Fall 2016 was reserved season to release invigorating and unsafe new invention; ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" opens by far a feasible wave of dissimilar films of a galactic anthology while focusing and securing its strongest point in the director's fervent declaration: war film which does not drink neither George Lucas' nor J. J. Abrams' lymph for manufacturing a deferential, nostalgic, cogitative, and sometimes dispiriting extension in Star Wars mythology.Despite economic success is safeguarded even with the most negligible work around this captivating constellation, its narrative or plot component emulates the scale clichés of the original trilogy: an inspiring princess, a humorous robot, a bold misanthrope, a strife between the dark side and the light side and of course theatrical display of spaceships assailing each other furiously. Conversely, this compact design takes risks as for inquiring into primitive and uncommon perspectives of the galaxy, which foster a fortification of a deeper concept around this mythology. And although as a last resort is a war celluloid more than remarkable—in spite of it merely sketches certain characteristics and focuses its plausible references in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967) by Robert Aldrich—does not manage to be a corporeal Star Wars movie since it's constantly held on by fan service and generates a quite primary treatment to the development. A prime look to unfamiliar areas from a standpoint's as ordinary as opposed, a wit tinged of tribulation and grief and one of the most honorable final thirds in a sci-fi/action/adventure blockbuster in recent times are the unforeseen top ambitions by a filmmaker who, respectfully, did not have good expectations on his hands owing to the controversial final reshoots, the script reformulations by Disney and doubtlessly the trembling replacement in musical lead from Alexandre Desplat to Michael Giacchino's baton, however, it's never too late to shut up a few individuals.It takes place before the events of ""Episode IV,"" ""Rogue One"" came up from a shallow idea of visual effects supervisor and CCO at Industrial Light & Magic John Knoll, which consisted in clarifying the time- space around what was the itinerary of the Death Star plans until being in Princess Leia Organa's hands , route somewhat named in ""A New Hope"". So this is the story of those ordinary beings who achieved the extraordinary. Innocent Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) opens with a retrospective scene about her girlhood, underlined by tragedy and misfortune. Thereon, it introduces her as a redeemed prisoner who is moved to a Rebel Alliance HQ. There, a transcendental mission has commended her in order to make contact with his fading father for locating and discovering the nature and the place of a substantially powerful weapon. And as if it were ""Suicide Squad"", ordinary people clan gradually takes form, finding its cardinal mover into the force. Although the fabled team bounces from a planet to another for terminating its commission, we figured out exiguous details about the crew captained by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) —who made me very proud;—likewise, most fans clamor for more background in Saw Gerrera's story, the leader of the Onderon rebels; something completely similar to what happened with the Joker in ""SQ"". Despite the fact that the depth was an authentic reverb, character designs and performances are what many fans were waiting for. Displaying a heterogeneous and multicultural acting cast, which delves into each contemporary civilization, the film takes advantage of the cultural range to generate a vast human-racial universe inside its world, in the same way, each performer gets its moment of glory before the decisive and evocative ending. Their performances made the audience proud, so much so that was ineluctable not yell in the credits of the motion picture.More suitable for adults than infants, more suitable for warsies than mass audiences. If it were action and conflagration scenes, the near-perfect third act would lead the film to the sublime, sadly, its burning and high-octane last forty minutes aren't enough to keep afloat lack of enthusiasm and the multiplicity of the beginning and exposition, opportunities lacking in momentum and vigor that exclusively are notable for performances and special effects. In time record, Giacchino composed an entrancing, nostalgic and fortifying soundtrack, which is assembled with the dark tone of each frame, also it testifies him as the first author in breaking John Williams' musical canon. ""Rogue One"" is more a war product, in where its spectacular music, sparkling performances, and nearly excellent action sequences invade unexplored lands and nothing irreverent in Star Wars world, also, the film gives a message of hope and encourages all us, who this year lost a great woman: imposing Carrie Fisher. RIP my Princess Leia."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,0.9934,2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"The purpose of Rogue one was simple, to fix a plot hole that had bothered Star Wars fans for nearly forty years. How did the rebels get a hold of the plans for the death star and why was it so easy to destroy? At a young age, Jyn Erso's (Felicity Jones), father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) was taken by the empire, to help develop the death star. Jyn was protected by the rebels before fleeing and living on her own, until one day, the rebels receive a message from Galen, saying that his daughter is the key to everything, and if they help get her to him, he can stop the empire.What I love about Rogue one, is the fact that for this film the franchise took a step back. If you ask anybody what their favorite Star Wars movie is, inevitably you will hear A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but why? It's because these films didn't have massive budgets, big name movie stars, the top directors in Hollywood, complex story lines, special characters thrown in for the kids, simply put they were the greatest space adventures of all-time. Rogue one leaves in the special effects, but the actors are not very well known, the director has only two films under his belt, the story is easy to follow, the characters are extremely likable, (much more so than the new ones in the Force Awakens), and most import of all the story is more narrowly focused and much easier to follow. There aren't a million different things going on here, there is one objective and it is being attempted by characters you can actually get behind.Jyn Erso, very much has the Katniss Everdeen tough girl thing going for her and she is paired with Cassian (Diego Luna), who has all the charisma of a young Harrison Ford, together the pair is infectious and you can't help but like them. I didn't feel any of that with Rey and Finn, in fact, I barely remembered their names. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention the scenery and special effects in the film, unlike in recent films, we see a multitude of planets, it isn't just all sand and sun. The planet in the final scene with the beaches and the energy shield in particular was just amazing.Finally there is the ending, I won't give anything away if you haven't seen it yet, but I will say this. While controversial, in my opinion, more perfect it could not have been. Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and I hope J.J. Abrams took notice. This is what the future of the franchise should be. Just because you have the largest film budget in history, doesn't mean your film has to have dozens of plots, and all these random characters we don't care about. Use that money on special effects, more amazing ships, weapons, and planets, and just make Star Wars fun again in a way that Rogue One reminded us it could be."
" *Spoilers* A true Star Wars film, made with love.
",0.5267,0.6102,2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a serious Star Wars film that primes the watcher for the greatest movie trilogy ever created.I've read a lot about Rogue One over the past week or two. I've seen it 3 times, twice at IMAX 3D and once in normal 2d. I've read some pretty cutting criticism, and seen some overly friendly reviews. I'm naturally a critical person and I was worried for this film, primarily because the director Gareth Edwards made a film that I didn't finish despite having paid a cinema entry ticket; Godzilla. I left halfway through.On my first watch of Rogue One, I briefly fell asleep halfway through. Admittedly I had *ahem* had a late night the evening before... Christmas drinks. I think it's fair to say that this film has some flaws and one of those flaws is a flaw that it shares with Godzilla. It suffers from a slightly bloated mid-section. It's not a major flaw, but a flaw nonetheless. Other flaws include the slightly forced fan service; the inclusion of C3PO and R2D2 felt a tad annoying and pointless, as did the addition of the ""Cantina ruffian"" in Jedha. We don't need this in every Star Wars film. We really don't. These are minor issues.This film is packing the greatest 45 minutes of action yet seen in any Star Wars film, and the rest of the film is simply an elaborate set up for this crescendo. It's a long time since I had to suppress an urge to punch the air in public, but there I was witnessing the Rebel fleet exit hyper space above Scarif - to the tune of John Williams Death Star attack music - as they arrived to support the Rogue One mission on a crazy suicide, all-or-nothing attack to get the plans on the planet below. It's exhilarating, hair-raising stuff that felt like the arrival of the Riders of Rohan at the fields of Pellenor, except... it's Star Wars. A great moment.Every Star Wars fan knows the end result of this story, but the tension as the attack gathered pace was beautifully crafted by the director, ensuring that although we all know what is coming there is still a room full of tension. There has been criticism of the character development in this story, but these criticisms feel vapid to me. Enough time was given to understand the motivation of all of the motley band of Scarif attackers. We didn't need to understand every single life nuance of Boba Fett to enjoy his character in Return of the Jedi so why do we suddenly need it here - that's not what Star Wars is about. What we do get is a tragic story arc for every character, all of whom gather under the banner of the Rebel alliance. They all have different histories, motivations, and reasons for being there, but it all comes down to the urge to fight back against a clear evil.They all make the ultimate sacrifice to give their cause a chance, and I found it exhilarating and life-affirming, sad but uplifting.The musical score does the story justice in the absence of John Williams, plucking at the heart strings when ""Star Dust"" breaks at the sight of her father, not seen since childhood, and lifting you on a wave as the action scenes unfold, with a stirring new Imperial theme as we see Vader foiled at the end staring after the Corellian Corvette that makes off with the plans.Many of the reviews I have seen have spent a lot of bandwidth moaning about quibbles, like the use of hardware seen in other films (RLM tediously spend a lot of airtime complaining about the use of At-Ats), or the fan service references, or the effects on Tarkin or Leia. These additions are not simply cheap attempts to give one positive reinforcement, but feel to me more like successful attempts to make this film fit with the feel and atmosphere of the original trilogy. I think this is done very successfully indeed.This film feels like a genuinely excellent addition to the original trilogy. It's serious in a way that the Force Awakens sometimes wasn't and it felt to me like a Star Wars film aimed towards an adult audience in thrall to the original films. So that's a hell of a lot of people. I think Gareth Edwards did brilliantly, and this is a more fitting addition to the films than the Force Awakens. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Force Awakens, and will do so again, but am fully aware of it's slightly infuriating imperfections and occasional cartoony feel. Rogue One has none of this.The story is serious, emotional, fun in parts but never cheesy, exhilarating for the last hour, and it achieves a staggering amount in sending us off to a New Hope with a fresh but heart-warming perspective. If anything, it does what I thought would be utterly impossible, and it makes the original Star Wars: A New Hope beginning feel even more serious and dangerous. It crystallises the vicious threat posed by Vader, and grounds the vulnerability and desperation of the Rebel alliance more than any previous film. It sets up the arrival of Luke Skywalker and his sister in a way that I never expected.Well done Gareth Edwards, and thank you!"

The Empire strikes back is better. The return of the Jedi is better. The Phantom menace is better. Attack of clones is better. Revenge the Sith. is also better. The Force wakens is also better. Star war clone wars the movie is also better. But still this a great movie. See all the Star wars movies. They are all great movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10. Because it is a great movie. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. This is a great movie. Great movie great movie great movie. See it.

",-0.1531,0.9306,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Obsession of diversity has somewhat hit every influence of life, and now I'm sad to say it has hit Star Wars.Unfortunately this film is not part of the classic Star Wars Sci-Fi saga, but rather an opportunity for PC point scoring.There is far too much political influence. And also an odd addition to this film of tasteless humour with no whit, leaving you with a sense of awkwardness.The majority of the so-called new spin of cast has complete lack of understanding what emotions to apply.On scale of 1 to 10, whereby over-dramatic acting is 9 and lack of emotional understating of the script is 10, I score it an 11.The directors have cleverly won the audience's approval by the great ending.. and the ending alone."

" Not a stand alone movie
",0.1877,0.2199,2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Rogue One is NOT a stand alone movie. SPOILERSIt is a direct prequel to Star Wars IV: A New Hope. The ending directly links straight into the beginning of that film. It sets it up. Really the numbering of the whole movie series should be changed. Rogue One should be Star Wars Episode IV, and the others after it should be incremented by 1. For example New Hope should be V and so on.As for the movie itself I didn't really like any of the characters. While the sarcastic robot made me laugh, he still can't hold a candle to R2 or C3PO. For this reason the fact that... :MASSIVE SPOILER:literally everyone dies didn't worry me too much.The plot narrative became quite confusing at times and was hard to follow.Ben Mendelson's character was a really weak villain.The action scenes were solid CGI fests.The final act, with the appearance of Vader, joining right into the start of A New Hope gave me chills though. That was a great pay off. Also the scene with the two main characters holding each before they died had some emotion. Having said that they could have milked it for a lot more. Sacrificing themselves, not knowing if it was in vain, could have been focused on. I guess it's a family movie and you can't make it too gut wrenching.If this was indeed a stand alone sci-fi movie I would probably give it a 4. It was a turgid mess with no engaging characters. It's because it does add to the movie series story that it's worth watching."

Despite this I still thought it was a fantastic film.I believe that the film started off quite slow and took quite a while for it to get into the action and this is unlike most other SW films as they go straight into the action. The characters for me made the film more enjoyable as I thought they made the film. I especially liked the Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) as he took his hope from the force and it showed the true meaning of the force and what effect it can have on people. K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) for me was a great edition, the droid was funny and powerful, he was a great edition to the story line. When we see Darth Vader towards the end when he is murdering all the rebels it reminded us as fans of the great antagonists he was. This scene was one of the best in the film.Rogue One for me was not the best of the SW films but it still supplied me with the SW feeling and why I love this franchise."
" Bored One. Let down... too many dark (low-light) scenes.

We went to see it this afternoon, and both of us were ready to walk out after about 45 minutes. Way too many scenes in the dark. On this line I'll say that it's OK if you've not seen any other Star Wars films. On this line I'll say that I wish I didn't have to write a minimum of 10 lines. On this line I'll say that we rented the latest Jason Bourne film and watched it when we got home and really liked the excitement... really liked THAT film better than Bored One. (Preview my reviewing...) Oh, come on! I have to include more lines? Well here goes. I recognized the beach and palm trees scenes, partly because the palm trees were perfectly set in nice rows. I had heard that the battle of the last hour was fantastic, terrific, and really great, but, ho-hum. It was the same old stuff."

However when I saw the final trailer, I was really hopeful and I was not disappointed. Great movie and it was great to see old Darth again......Disney need to figure out a way to get Darth back into another spin off movie somehow because from all accounts having Vader in the movie was a huge draw for SW fans. The only negative I have with this movie was that there was no trace of the brilliant music that was used in the final trailer which was so moving and really got my excitement level for the movie at fever pitch."
" I laughed, I cheered, I cried for this FABULOUS new entry into the Star Wars Saga
",0.6408,0.9929,2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"On a remote farming planet, a gentleman named Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) lives with this wife and young daughter Jyn (later Felicity Jones). They are part of the rebel alliance, trying to stay away from the Imperial forces, for Galen is a brilliant scientist and they want him to work for their destructive Empire. Its not known how long this family has been in hiding but they have schooled their daughter on where to hide if the BAD FOLKS come calling. They do. Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry) flies in and Galen tries to face his team alone. All too soon, his wife is shot as she tries to save her husband and Dr. Erso is captured. The forces fail to find Jyn but, instead, a friend of her father's, Saw Herrera (Forest Whitaker) rescues and raises her. Flash forwarding several years, we find that Jyn is in a prison work camp, somehow abandoned by Saw. When a transport she is riding in comes under attack by rebels, she escapes and soon matches up with Cassian (Diego Luna). Initially, they save each other as they maneuver this outpost of a planet. Yet, soon Cassian's plan is spilled. He must go to Saw Herrera's planet so he can FIND details of Dr. Erso and learn the fate of a trader pilot sent to talk with Saw as well. With his trusted ""re-programmed"" Imperial Droid, K-250 (Alan Tudyk), they are amazed to find that Jyn is his little girl. Off they go. It is on this sacred planet that they discover a monastery is in ruins and the whole place turned into a giant mining establishment, collecting fuel for a new, deadly weapon of the Empire. You guessed it, its for the Death Star. Two monks, one blind, help Jyn and Cassian locate Saw, where Jyn views a holographic message sent from her father, explaining his ultimate triumph. Despite having to build the Death Star, he has put in a secret spot of vulnerability, where the massive weapon can be destroyed. They must go to the planet where video blueprints are housed and retrieve it for the Rebels. Oh, is that all? When they make it back to the Rebel base, Jyn and Cassian are stunned that the group is ready to surrender, having witnessed the power of the Death Star. But, a small group, including the two monks, the rescued pilot, and K-250 are ready to risk all! Will they be successful? There's no question what this answer will be, but there is much sacrifice involved, sadly. This FABULOUS new entry to the Star Wars saga is exceptionally well done. The new characters are amazing, with Jones and Luna making a fine pair, and the rest so endearing, so brave. As the cast boasts a wide variety of alien creatures, as well, it is a great joy. Next, the sets couldn't be better, with an absolutely amazing creation of different planets to feast your eyes upon. Add on the great costumes, superb special effects, terrific story and never-lagging direction and here is a film to cherish indeed. George Lucas himself is most likely thunder-struck at the connection to his own first story, as this one takes place right before the actions of A New Hope. But, a warning, this is probably the most tear-generating entry of the series, so bring tissues. There is even a scene which hearkens back to another great film, Deep Impact, and is equally poignant. But, in truth, don't go rogue and think you can miss this one. Get off your behind now and rush to the theater!"
" A Decent Movie that struggles to decide whether it's 'Star Wars' or not
",-0.7269,-0.9875,2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"A decent enough movie that struggles with a design by committee plot whilst trying to decide whether the film is part of Star Wars or something else.This begins from the outset, there's the familiar 'A long time ago' but no rolling intro (understandable) the music plays, it sounds like Star Wars but not quite... and it is this vibe that plays out through the entire movie.In theory the story is solid, the outcome of the movie (like Ep.III) is already set – its just a question of how to get there. However this is where the problems start. Everything is squeezed into the film, some new looking TIE Fighters and some different types of Stormtroopers, they want the Force to be in there so they introduce a cliché martial artist character and there's the token droid etc etc... mixed in with loads of action.And visually it's great, but it seems to be at the expense of everything else. In between all of the CGI, recreating the 70's outfits and paying homage to the other Star Wars movies (again!!) they forget about the characters. All typical, uninspired and under developed – the only one you feel bothered about at the end is K-2SO. Even including Vader seems a bit pointless, as other have said the scenes featuring him have no impact on the story and ultimately serve to force the conclusion of the film to tie in with Ep.IV. Finally a question: does every 'new' Star Wars Film now have to pay homage to its predecessors?Is it a contractual requirement now that in order to be considered worthy with fans / critics quotes and scenes (or with Force Awakens the entire movie) have to be recreated, spun or shoe horned into the story? Has any other franchise felt the need to do this to the extremes that the Star Wars movies now do!Maybe it's all Obi Wan's fault when he said to Anakin: ""You'll be the death of me"" – who knows!?""Rebellions Are Built On Homage"""
" Solid Episode 3.9: an extra brick in the SW edifice
",0.1531,0.998,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"After all, it is not so complex to make a good action movie.DON'TSNo Jar-Jar Binks. No ridiculous Ewoks. No Muppet Show, as in Jabba's lair at the beginning of Episode 6.Don't cast the worst actor of the galaxy in the main role, as in Episodes 2 and 3.Don't uselessly copy previous Episodes, as Episode 7 did.No gratuitous and/or inflated action. No awkward situations.No idiotic dialogues. No blabbering about the Force. No pseudo-Freudian heaviness about being one's father, about killing one's father, about finding one's path.DO'SKeep it simple, at last. Build a solid plot without inconsistencies. Justify action scenes with coherent reasons. Use efficient special effects for a valid purpose.Maintain pacing, alternating fast and slow scenes. Edit effectively.Cast talented actors: Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, etc. Insert funny dialogues.Pay attention to details: the broken glass falling into the vault highlights how imposing the place is; when Darth Vador emerges from darkness with his lightsaber at the end, the effect is striking.Show gorgeous landscapes.Renew the soundtrack and only hint at standard SW themes instead of recycling them throughout (although this can feel underwhelming for real fans).Have a mixed ending, where the mission is fulfilled but at the cost of many casualties.Also, ""Rogue One"" convincingly links with Episode 4:
It solves Episode 4 flaws. I have been wondering for almost 40 years: why the heck did the mighty Empire allow such a dangerous weakness in the powerful Death Star, which they built with great care? And how did the Rebels manage to get the secret plans? Now we know.It purposefully stages situations and characters of the Saga.It probably ends a few minutes or hours before Darth Vador jumps into an Imperial spaceship to chase Princess Leia who just flew away (regarding this, it would have been even better to see R2-D2 in her ship, in order to fully reconcile with the beginning of Episode 4, when she gives the plans to the droid).Nonetheless, the movie is more than just a spin-off: it is a full-blown Episode per se, with a developed story, credible new characters and real qualities. References to Episode 4 are not invasive: there is a fair balance between connection to the Saga and autonomy.WHAT IS MISSING?The movie is not very original, it feels rather formatted. But then is it possible to completely overhaul a franchise that already has 7 episodes?There is not much character depth. Actually the most touching role is K-2SO and we almost feel sorry when he goes down.Apart from Chirrut's fighting skills, action scenes are standard.Some emotional scenes are a bit silly, although they are limited.The ""resurrection"" of late actors through CGI (Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher) is not completely successful.This is why I can only rate the movie 7/10. Good, but not amazing.Still, ""Rogue One"" is for me the best of the franchise to date. Here, I have to confess I am not a huge SW fan (sincere apologies to the real fans, the Force is not given to everybody). Second best would be Episode 4: sets a mythology, funny, laid back, however style and special effects are dated. Third best would be Episode 5: truly great scenes, yet there is too much talk about the Force and Darth Vader's revelation he is Luke's father falls flat (sorry, fans). Then Episodes 2 and 3: some good scenes but mostly over the top. Episodes 1, 6 and 7 have already fallen into oblivion.""Rogue One"" reviews are very contrasting. Some fans find it great, others feel cheated, which I can understand: the movie is not overwhelming and does not renew the Saga. Yet it is entertaining, no-nonsense and visually impressive.WHAT IS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE?Indeed, appreciating action movies is very subjective because the border is thin between good and terrible. There is a subtle balance to find in action scenes, rhythm, dialogues and music: too much or too little of an ingredient, and it flops. Also, impeccable acting is paramount: the same role can feel awesome or awful depending on who plays it. For instance in ""Rogue One"", Chirrut and Baze are credible, individually and as a pair; however with less good actors they would just have been laughable. Hence appreciation can easily fluctuate from one side to the opposite.The main reason for this volatility is that action movies essentially rely on form with limited content, and form alone is always on the edge since it cannot be compensated by interesting substance. To me ""Rogue One"" passes the test, to an extent."
" Ah, man...
",0.0,0.6166,2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"Surely this won't be the popular opinion, but if it weren't for the dazzling cinematography and directing, it would be a bad movie.Nostalgia aside, and I won't to give away any spoilers, the writing was terribly mundane. I mean, it felt like a struggle to get any comic relief whatsoever -- that sort of wry wit is usually commonplace in Star Wars films. It was beautiful to watch, and it raised the bar with regards to the CGI standards within film. For that, I commend it. Otherwise, the dialogue was hollow, the characters forgettable (aptly), and the acting was OK. As a Star Wars film, it knows how to play on some of the charm and wistfulness of the previously made films."
" Am I the only one who didn't like it?
",-0.2755,-0.9311,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"I've seen all the Star Wars movies, and while I'm not a massive fan, I can definitely appreciate the old ones after seeing this new addition to the saga. The original three (and following prequels) had a certain heart that was inherently missing from Rogue One. While the CGI wasn't as good, and the fighting wasn't as badass, it just connected viewers to the storyline a lot more than Rogue One did. Even the prequels had a certain charm, because you could see how hard they were trying to please Star Wars fans, and continue telling the story. This movie was trying to be cool and gritty, but it ended up ruining everything that Star Wars is known for. What it lacked in charm, it also lacked in Star Wars-ness. You easily could have swapped out ""death star"" for any other futuristic sounding weapon and you'd have had your run of the mill action movie. It felt more like Avatar than Star Wars, especially since there were so many human characters and so few aliens/droids. EFFECTS Rogue One was purely a money grabber, and you could see that all their energy had gone into the effects (although Princess Leia looked crazy fake). You also couldn't really appreciate the CGI, because it just looked like live-action shots. Also, seeing the same things for 2 hours makes you pretty numb to it by the end. SCRIPT The script was the laziest piece of garbage I've ever heard, and the part where Jyn finds the secret plans labeled ""Stardust"" could be seen from a mile away. The plot was so simple, yet I also found it hard to understand what was going on since the pacing was so choppy and there were so many irrelevant characters.They repeatedly tried (and failed) to add comedy to the film, one example being the cringy banter between Jyn and the robot that no one cared about. The fighting sequences were also too frequent, and it felt like the last 45 minutes were pure action. It made for a rather anti-climatic ending, since we'd already seen 100 explosions throughout the duration of the movie. ACTING Everyone was fine. Literally no person stuck out in my mind, and no one had a developed enough personality to even distinguish a single trait. All the team mates on Rogue One were so blandly portrayed that I don't remember any of their names. The blind guy was actually quite annoying, and the praying thing got old after 2 seconds."
" As opposed to the Force Awakens this one has some silver linings and provides well....hope.
",0.0,-0.9897,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"***To restate, this review might contain spoilers*** I went to see this movie with my expectations deliberately managed and curbed after the uninspired cash grab that was the Force Awakens, a movie that made me write my first, severely disappointed, IMDb review.Star Wars movies are not the ones I turn to for some kind of 'elevated experience', or a strong, character driven stories. There, as in almost all of the other Star Wars movies, this particular movie is for sure lacking.It also has some plot holes, both within the movie itself, and especially within the greater story line that is the whole saga. If 10 years down the line someone who never watched Star Wars decides to watch these movies in chronological order I am sure they'll get very confused about this installment, and the New Hope's mentioning of the Death Star plans being secured by some thing called Bothan spies.Still, compared to the shameless cash grab and horribly inconsistent and lazily written Force Awakens, this movie manages to hold its own. Granted, the actors are fairly mis-directed and are unable to deliver the chemistry as we got to enjoy in the original trilogy, but they are less absurd in their development and exposition. Ironically the actor I was looking to see most in this franchise was Forest Whitaker's, and sadly his character annoyed me the most. His role is set up to be that of a ruthless resistance leader who has crossed the veil in having become as much an agent of terror as the Empire is, to get that setup and then have him lay down and die so easily was just....confusing, and it showed Forest had trouble walking that line to deliver something convincing.As opposed to many other reviewers I actually found myself very much enjoying and being invested in Felicity Jones' performance as Jyn Erso, evolving from a resentful, a-political loner into an invested and motivated agent for the rebellion - even if or because of her motives always staying personal rather than political.Now with a production like this, no one will be surprised that the special effects are stunning and captivating, so that doesn't deserve much mentioning. As a reviewer however I would like to point out that the director here, in my mind, did something not so much amazing but for sure worthy of mentioning. The director under- rather than overstated. Where in Episode VII J.J. Abrams felt the only way to trump the Death Star was by making something that blew up even more planets and killed more lives, in this movie the Death Star is limitly tested, destroying cities and locales but shot in such a way that it feels as horrifying as watching the detonation of a nuclear bomb.The nods to more obscure Star Wars lore were also largely tasteful I thought, nothing too on the nose, but simple, short homages. So too the inclusion of Darth Vader. Yes, good ol' Darth making a pun was a bit weird, but it was nothing that disturbed me as much as it seems to have done the more negative reviewers. In fact, one could choose to see it as simple hubris, as Anakin ultimately dies knowing he got enslaved by his own foolish ambitions as well. And then there is the final scene of Vader in pursuit of the stolen plans and it very effectively establishes him as a truly dark and terrifying force of his own.So yeah, this movie isn't fantastic. It won't be a classic or a part of popular culture history like the originals, but as far as 'chewing gum for the brain' movies go, it was a nice flight of fantasy. 6 out of 10."
" 2 hours 2 long
",0.0,0.9976,2017-01-08 00:00:00,2,"Now I know that many of you guys will be smashing that ""Not Helpful"" button because I am giving this a bad review (because the same thing happened when I gave ""The Force Awakens"" a very positive review), but there's one thing I beg you to do. Hear me out! Read this review before deciding that I have no good taste, because I believe that I have good reasons to personally dislike this movie, even if others like it. And I will admit there are positive things about it. As a matter of fact, the performances (except for Forest Whitaker's really silly accent), directing, and visual effects are all very well done. I will not deny that this is a well made film that took some hard work and effort to create.However...It is boring! There is nothing particularly interesting about the plot, the characters all have little to no personality, I was so bored I wasn't paying any attention-I was just staring at a screen as random stuff was being thrown in my face. It is packed with uninteresting dialogue, surprisingly boring action sequences, and an overly depressing tone. I am all for dark movies, but this is just ridiculous. One of the most annoying new blockbuster movie clichés is that every movie has to be so dark and depressing for seemingly no reason, simply because it works flawlessly with Christopher Nolan's work. But, this is because Nolan is a much more talented filmmaker than Garreth Edwards, whose work I admittedly enjoyed in the past. I thought that, while very flawed, his 2014 ""Godzilla"" movie was really underrated and epic. I enjoyed that movie, even if it was dark there were still cool things about it and it didn't feel overlong or boring to me. Unfortunately, this film is DEFINITELY boring for me, and is almost factually overlong.Think about it, the whole concept of this film is stealing plans. If the characters were developed, perhaps it would be worth a 2 and a half hour runtime, but the characters each have little to no personality or backstory. This is a movie of nothingness, of a painful dullness. I attempted to eat too many Reese's Pieces during this movie so I could throw up because then something interesting would be happening. Footage of me pathetically vomiting out of boredom would be a much more powerful and engaging movie with better characters and conflict than ""Rogue One"".I watch movies to be engaged and fascinated, not to be bored. This movie is just flat out BORING. I've already stated that plenty of times in this review, but that is because I mean it with all of my heart. I could not pay attention or care about anything that was going on because of the lack of personality the film had in its writing and even in its cinematography. The visual tone of this film is needlessly dull and grey. I know many will defend this movie by calling it a ""gritty war drama"", but it doesn't work as that either. Also, ""Star Wars"" is mainly a fantasy universe, why would I want to watch a gritty war drama taking place in this universe rather than in a more realistic environment. Why do the most fantastic, wondrous concepts have to be transformed into something realistic? The original trilogy, which pretty much everyone agrees includes the best three films in the entire saga, did not try to be realistic. It tackled a few realistic themes and conflicts, but those themes were never made to be over the top. The original films were not gritty, they had much more humor and fun. They were entertaining thrill rides that also included characters and stories we cared about. They could be intense, funny, and even tragic at times, and it always worked because they were made in such a way that the viewer was always engaged in the story, the viewer always liked the characters. ""Rogue One"" is the opposite of this.Now I'm getting really controversial...So it seems that 90% of IMDb user reviewers thought that ""The Force Awakens"" was 1/10 trash, despite it being a very well made and colorful film that genuinely had some heart and soul. It was flawed, but it was also fun. The special effects were wonderful, it worked as a celebration of ""Star Wars"". The characters were likable and (for the most part) memorable. It had humor and heart, action and suspense. It may have been a very unoriginal movie due to it being so ridiculously similar to the original 1977 classic, but at least it felt like the people behind it were much more loving and joyful. It feels like the people behind ""Rogue One"" just wanted to kill themselves and make money from basement dwelling internet geeks. However, ""Rogue One"" is packed with 10/10 star reviews, people saying that it made up for ""The Force Awakens"". This is something almost impossible for me to wrap my mind around. Was it just more awesomer? Were the past references so epic that it is now a masterpiece of cinema?I am sure there are plenty of great and intelligent people that will disagree with me entirely, and I am well aware that I may have been a little unfairly mean while making fun of some members of the ""Star Wars"" fanbase, but the overall point of this review is just:This movie is boring and I do not understand the praise."
" Wow...makes Ep. I, II, & III look good by comparison
",0.4404,-0.9987,2017-01-08 00:00:00,2,"The reasons that Rogue One tanked:1) Any Star Wars movie that does not have Jedi, the Force, and light sabers is going to be, by definition, boring.2) The music sounded similar, but not nearly as good as, the original soundtrack. It was plain uninspiring, and mostly just helped to muddle all of the terrible dialog. In Rogue One the music was just lots of unending white noise, a distraction that wouldn't stop. Easy to tell that John Williams had nothing to do with it.3) Once again, the characters in the movie were not likable (except Jyn, she's beautiful). Casting was mostly terrible, with few exceptions. It didn't bother me at all when they died off--just like Episodes I, II, & III. I didn't care what happened to any of them.4) The dialog was God-awful; who wrote this droll s**t?5) Oh, the dialog--it went on, and on, and on, and on, and I've never seen an action movie before that had so much stale talking. It made me just wish the movie would end soon. The dialog became an audio version of Chinese water torture.6) Oh, the action--even the action was, incredibly, slow-paced. It seemed to take forever for anything to happen during what were supposed to be action scenes. Things and actions that should have taken 10-to-60 seconds in the movie were drawn out to 5 minutes or more. Awful pacing.7) The cinematography was, almost completely, awful, as most movies are nowadays. The camera would not hold still, for even a fraction of a second, in nearly any scene in the movie (real or computer-generated). (Don't believe me?--compare this movie to the original Star Wars and it will quickly become evident.) This made it difficult to follow the action, or to even care after a while. (At least this movie lacked JJ Abrams' epilepsy-inducing, and continuous, lens flares and light flashes, thank God.)8) Even though the human characters were speaking English, most had accents so heavy that it was difficult for me to understand them (and the terrible and ever-present soundtrack made matters worse). What were the character's names? I couldn't tell, so I gave up caring who-was-whom. 9) Where were all of the aliens? They showed in an occasional scene, but infrequently. Almost all humans, in a Star Wars universe. What gives? Especially the last 3/4 of the movie.10) In the final battle scene, the rebels that were fighting on the ground didn't look like rebels; most of them looked exactly like the troopers in Aliens. Wrong movie.11) This movie entirely skipped the great opening sequence musical score and moving text of all other Star Wars movies; I know that this is an offshoot movie, but this distanced itself too far from the originals. If they had used the moving text to explain the story line, as the rest of the Star Wars movies have, then maybe they could have removed half of the awful dialog that was in the movie. Bad storytelling. Suddenly, I miss George Lucas behind the wheel. 12) And the missing opening, dramatic, musical score by John Williams left a huge gaping hole in the Star Wars experience from the very beginning of the movie--this was just a taste, and perhaps a warning, of what was to follow.13) Every scene featuring long, excessive, boring, dialog had to be done with close-up facial shots; there are so few scenes that show actors and their surroundings, making the visuals too claustrophobic. Wasted sets and environments. Bad cinematography. Lost chances to enrich the storytelling experience.14) The droid main character had lots of funny lines, but they were not funny. The words were funny, but the delivery was done as bad as it possibly could have been done. A real shame. C3P0 could do a funny delivery, but this POS couldn't.15) When the rebel fleet was trying to break though the force field gate, and couldn't, why didn't they destroy the circular spaceship that generated the shield gate? Eventually they did by forcing a Star Destroyer into it, but it seemed they didn't think to shoot at the damn thing for the previous 15 or 20 minutes!16) Why were the rebels (and the main story line of the movie) trying to kill the designer of the Death Star, after it had already been built? What's the point? So the main story arc was a waste of time, and pointless. Soap operas have more believable and cohesive stories.17) The computer-generated face of (the late) Grand Moff Tarkin was uncannily realistic, but his face had too many and almost-constant odd facial movements that just looked weird, and unnatural. He looked normal, but his face didn't act normal. And, of course, every shot of him was a close-up facial shot (like everyone else's). In this instance, they just had to prove how good they were at bringing the dead back to life. Lots of times. And the recreation of Princess Leia's face was done the very same way--so close up, just to prove how good the CG artists are--that you could count the hairs in her nostrils. Not pretty.18) All of the characters in the movie--except the main characters, Jyn and Cassian--had so little reason to be in the movie at all; everyone else had minor parts that lasted hours on end. They became story line clutter.A huge disappointment. I'll save my money in the future."
" The best of the new movies
",0.6369,0.9807,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"For me this was the best movie since the original trilogy. It relies less on easy jokes and CGI and more on a good story and action as the good old original ones, and yet it is more unique than episode VII. I appreciated a lot the care to detail on robots, computer graphics and space ship instruments, that don't look (a lot) more high tech than original episodes IV, V and VI, which would be odd given the chronology of events. On episodes I, II and III, technology keeps looking more developed than in the original trilogy which is strange. In Rogue One one they sorted this out in a better way. The way the plot develops also makes it harder for there to be a sequel to this movie which is also refreshing has today almost every movie has a door open to one..."
" Better than The Force Awakens!
",0.4926,0.931,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"After last year's mildly entertaining yet sometimes frustrating TFA, I was ready to give up on modern Star Wars. However, I saw the trailer for this film and I said to myself, ""why not give it a second chance?"" and I bought a ticket for a night showing the day the film was released into theaters. And I'm very glad I did. Rogue One is a fresh new take on different characters that are developed to be loved by the audience, although the same classic Star Wars feel is present with plenty of charms. For example: instead of the irritating Jar Jar Binks that doesn't fit in a Star Wars movie, a new comic relief named K-2SO is introduced as a sarcastic yet hilarious droid that doesn't need to incorporate childish fart jokes to be funny, providing the sassy humor that all OT fans adore. The CGI is absolutely seamless; everything blends in incredibly realistically with the actors and props, and the action sequences are some of the most creative I've seen at the theater this year; remember that glorious airport fight scene that Civil War showcased? Well, Rogue One tops that in as many ways as possible! Oh, and the Easter eggs, cameos and Darth Vader are just the icing on the already delicious cake- they will leave you jaw-dropped. Go see Rogue One, but make sure it's in 2D, as 3D will ruin the already amazing visuals. Have a blast!"
" star wars is about faith, but its supposed to be about war
",-0.775,-0.9978,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"star wars has war in its title, but the films really deal more in faith. I am not saying this is bad, because there really are not a lot of mainstream films dealing with faith in the way star wars is. However, a franchise with the title star wars should include stars and be about war. Although stars are included, no movie has really talked about war. Now, with the Star Wars Anthology series existing, we can expect films with different style than the main episodes. While Han Solo film is supposed to be an action- adventure film with a western feel, then Rogue One is a film about war and its price. Not only is this film gritty, dark and includes colorless visuals, it also deals with the fact that in war, even the good guys have to do bad things, like be assassins and spies, which is not as honorable as being Han Solo or Luke Skywalker. But without this there would not be victory. In fact, one of the good guys gets killed by the rebels as a mistake. Also, all of the films main characters die. But they gave the Death Star plans to the rebels and so, victory comes. In fact, if they would have failed, Luke Skywalker would not be a legend after all. Also, I like how the film acknowledges that Darth Vader is a broken soul and does not shy away from using material from the prequels( they are part of the canon) and uses both Coruscant and Mustafar. But at its heart, it is a gritty war film bout war and its price."
" The Best ""Star Wars"" Saga Since ""The Empire Strikes Back!""
",-0.2942,-0.9972,2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.Since ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope"" came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. ""Rogue One"" relates the story about that sweet spot, and ""Star Wars"" aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of ""Episode III."" Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like ""Rogue One"" fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in ""Rogue One"" are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Dr. Strange""), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen's wife Kyra (Valene Kane of ""Victor Frankenstein"") and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of ""Platoon""), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn't prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of ""Blood Father"") and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of ""Serenity"") break Jyn (Felicity Jones of ""Brideshead Revisited"") out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw's camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of ""Iron Monkey 2"") and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of ""Let the Bullets Fly""), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn't rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, ""Rogue One"" imitates ""Star Wars"" in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won't forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, ""Rogue One"" qualifies as the best ""Star Wars"" epic since ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
" Meh

I'm a fan of the first 6 movies... Not so much of The Force Awakens, but at least that one felt a little bit more like the originals. Rogue One is good for the Star Wars fans who want to watch one more movie, and whatever it is, if it's under the Star Wars name, will do. I must admit that the during the first half an hour I felt quite lost... Anyway the movie was OK, that's why I give it a 6."

Instead I got a mediocre war drama. Replace the Tie Fighters with airplanes. Replace the Death Star with a Nazi base. It's just a run of the mill snatch and grab flick with little soul, lore, or the magic that Star Wars is supposed to capture. How this film is rated 8.1, along with the terrible Force Awakens, is beyond me. How could this film be as highly rated as a Stanley Kubrick film?Mediocre.

Mendelsohn plays Orson Krennic, Imperial Director of Weapons Research, Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) plays Jyn's father, Galen and Whitaker plays Saw Garrera, a friend of the Erso family.

" Proof that stories do no need to make sense to generate profit
",0.1779,-0.9626,2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"In the context of a Star Wars universe, the story sequencing of Rogue One is blotchy, vague and un-compelling. The film made a poor attempt at creating a clear, linear storyline. Outside the context of a Star Wars universe, the story made no sense, and so the viewers are left to their own devices to try and keep up with the unexpected scene jumps. Characters give you no reason to empathize with their objective to oppose the empire. Rather than going on a journey with the protagonist, we become unbiased observers witnessing a war of which we have no emotional investment in. The originals were brilliant because the characters all had human elements and everyone from Han to the monster in the trash compactor was memorable. Darth Vader did not need to display excessive use of the Force to fear him, rather, he conveyed it by his actions. R2-D2 only needed to chirp and beep, yet he was a better-written character than ANY in Rogue One. In the originals, you could feel their joys, their losses, their victories and defeats; and discover the Force with Luke as he transformed from a boy to a man, fighting the empire along the way. Rogue One seems to miss the point.Rogue One places you in scenes that serve no purpose and only generate more questions than answers. How did Saw Gerrera know to find Jyn after she hid in the bunker? How does Chirrut use the force if he is not a Jedi? If he can use it, does that not actually make him one? What is the backstory on his gun-wielding friend? Is Grand Moff Tarkin in charge of the Death Star or the man in white? Why is Vader on a lava planet? I could go on.The Emperor is naked. Nobody wants to call out a pop culture relic. It's easy to go with the crowd, wear rose-colored glasses and not make a fuss. A movie is not intrinsically good because of the banner it holds; the proof is in the pudding. Rogue One is a forgettable film riddled with bland characters and a poor story that pampers to an audience that enjoys fast cameras, uncanny CGI and fan-serviced explosions."

Meanwhile, Erso and a ragtag group of warriors, including Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and sassy android K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) must hatch a plan to grab the blueprints for the DS, as the diabolical Commander Krennic (Ben Mendolsohn) marches forth with his destructive plans.The Force Awakens re-igniting the fan base for Star Wars at the end of last year is a debatable argument, since with or without this thundering revival of the franchise, it would still be one of the most enduring in the history of motion pictures. With the first film entering its fortieth year this year, the SW saga provides a service to the art of motion pictures like no other, a thunderous, colourful assault on the senses that will always be suited to the big screen and understandably has an enduring fan base. Now another big screen instalment takes the story back before the start, for fans of the series obviously, with unsatisfying results.An all star cast comprised of hot young talent and older, experienced hands have all ploughed into this venture, but the result is something with big ambitions, but no sense of direction or genuine engagement with the audience. Director Gareth Edwards, getting a name for making big screen ventures of established franchises, simply doesn't have a strong enough plot to guide this effort, nor the material to create character development that makes you care about the characters. As a result, none of the cast turn in performances that could be considered their best, and you may struggle to stay awake during the none spectacular bits.Visually, it's as amazing as ever, a swooping, swirling adventure that could beat any theme park ride, even if some of it feels a little 70s esque. But, standing on its own, it really leaves wanting. **"
" Much more like it than the Awful Force Awakens.
",-0.0534,0.9786,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I personally don't think the main Star Wars Saga will be where the real interest in this franchise will be and 'The Force Awakens' did nothing to disprove that point. That story was over at the end of episode 6 'Return of the Jedi'.Whatever they say George Lucas and Steven Spielberg never had a plan for the prequels and/or the 3 episodes that would follow the original trilogy when they were filmed. They maintain they did but the films we are seeing will only superficially do what they intended if at all. That is okay with me, as that is the creative process, but I do have issue with them saying otherwise.I did see the point of explaining how we got to 'A New Hope' and the prequels gave us a history of those events but failed overall to really succeed with the wider audience.The real fan interest will be captured by, and will remain with, the films that propose to 'fill in the blanks.'Rogue One proves this but fails to really charm. It gives the immediate prequel to 'A New Hope' without getting us to really care. As an events based tie in it is compelling and satisfying. The characters however fail to really connect with the audience and we don't really feel for them.Overall a 8 out of 10. Loses one for the characters and one for not getting me to really believe in the rebellion but I was satisfied with everything else I saw. Episode 8 is not one I am looking forward to but Rogue One has given me renewed hope in a Han Solo, Boba Fett or Darth Vader movie that will give us more of the Smugglers history or the Bounty Hunters fate, when he escaped the Jedi after his father died and then went on to get out of that Sarnak pit (because I like to think he did.) The fallen Jedi's actions in his prime pursuing the rebellion whilst perhaps being conflicted and his further descent into the Dark Side and an obsessional hunt for Obi Wan Kenobi perhaps?These are much richer tapestries I think but the one that would break the box office would be the young Yoda. If that was done properly how good would it be? Remember how you lost it when Yoda confronted Dukku and absolutely lit him up!!!!!"
" Great addition to Star Wars, and hopefully the first of many...
",0.4939,0.9928,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Rogue One, being the first of many to come in Disney's new anthology to act in conjunction with the main 'Skywalker' branch is really anything but a spin off. It is a film that fits seamlessly between episodes 3 & 4 filling in gaps and possible plot holes of the original film ""A New Hope"". In many ways this film is episode 3.5 due to its ability to fill in and reference points from the original trilogy, and with lingering throwback shots of C3-PO, R2-D2 and blue milk aside, some of the reused sequences featuring original trilogy cast members in unison with amazingly done CGI work: as most Star Wars fans could probably attest to the fledgling nature of it's practice in the prequel trilogy, were used to great effect in bringing back minor and major characters alike. Of particular note being Grand Moff Tarkin originally portrayed by the great Peter Cushing, who is just about brought back from the dead to aid new cast members.Felicity Jones and Ben Mendelsohn among others were inspired casting choices that paid dividends in bringing the film to life, with each and every character requiring, almost disappointingly, brief introductions before the main plot line, that inferred their place within the Star Wars universe paving the way for a visually powerful story that serves to unite them as The Rebellion.The imagery was astounding with particular emphasis on scenery establishing shots that really showed the depth of planetary source material available to Gareth Edwards's, with the opening scene on Lah'mu being an excellent example of traditionalist Star Wars trope emphasizing that although this is not Star Wars, it still remains within the same world. And as always, a classic orchestral score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino: a worthy successor to John Williams, aids in the creation of a powerful atmosphere in unison with costume design to recreate that original Star Wars feel that Lucas and others formed over 3 decades ago.Ultimately the story of Rogue One was entirely predictable, obviously leading into A New Hope, but that did not stop this film from providing laughs, thrills and intrigue that have become synonymous within Star Wars mythology and as a great fan of the series I can only hope that each iteration of this new anthology is as good as the last."
" No, just no
",-0.5267,-0.0742,2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"The first Rogue One trailer was great. It promised a dangerous mission of vital importance against insurmountable odds with a heroine who may or may not turn to the Dark Side.Reality is a harsh mistress, particularly when she's had time to do reshoots and play around in the editing room. Which is understandable, because while Star Wars has a deep emotional connection for many, in the end it's also a product. Each movie is designed to make money, scratch that, a whole lot of money. So yes, Disney is going to push and pull on things in the editing process to invoke all the feels, making us want to open our hearts to our wallets so that we can lose ourselves for two hours.Too bad this example does a such a textbook case at failing. The plucky band of heroes have almost no character development. The plot is needlessly long and convoluted and revolves around a death star. The action is badly directed and ultimately this is a story that doesn't matter much and didn't need to be told. Save your money and catch it cable."
" Much Better Than Force Awakens
",0.4404,-0.7883,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Finally we get to see Star Wars movies are more than just finding the weak spot of a gigantic weapon, opening fire and destroying it. Rogue one had a wonderful plot which connected the construction (and the weaknesses) of the Death Star to the beginning of A New Hope. The formation of the Rebellion, how and why the Empire had its weakness about the weapon, how the plans of that were acquired were all executed in a delightful way. The overall setting was constructed with respect to the original movies. Storm troopers, imperial structures and star ships, rebel alliance ships, and (obviously) the main characters were aligned to the original story line. Not much deviation from what Lucas had in mind, yet such diversity in planets, species, robots, soldiers and many more. Hopefully the next movies will be like this one, more than presenting unknown characters and more gigantic star killers!"

Wow.You know they made something right when one of the most likable characters is a droid, business as usual, it's Star Wars were talking about!What really makes me sad is how they could pull of this movie so good, but completely screw up the disaster called Episode 7.

After three weeks of hearing everyone at work say this is the first good Star Wars movie to come out since the originals I broke down and watched it. I am in absolute shock at how good this movie was after the incredible disappointment of the last four. This movie got back to the basics and was in tuned with the originals. There were not any goofy characters, overwhelming CGI, and technology of equipment all matched the originals. As far as my collection is concerned, this is Episode III and I will buy it when available on Blu-Ray."

" Almost there but a few slips
",0.0,-0.8172,2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"First off the bat, this is a good film and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga.This is firmly in the vain of Star Wars 4 - 6, NOT 1 - 3.To be fair 1 - 3 is a bit pants, Jar Jar Binks anyone, they are a bit shiny, a bit clever, a bit crisp around the edges and a bit polished. 4 - 6 are a bit grubby, a bit dog eared and a bit dark; R1 is firmly in the 4 - 6 camp, the ships are a bit battered, the characters are a bit grubby and war weary and not the nice guys usually portrayed, they've done bad things for the rebellion.This is a good change of tack for these films. The beach battle scenes wouldn't be out of place in any WW2 movie, a full on war movie feel; the space battle is on an epic scale, loved it.There are a few down sides that do detract from the overall movie. The turnover of characters is huge, because of this you don't get the attachment you do with the characters of the trilogies, which is just as well as they do pop off so fast. The CGI for Tarkin isn't quite there, he's a bit ""not right"" on screen but a welcome addition. Finally, the opening, WHERE WAS THE OPENING SCRAWL, the film just starts but no opening blurb and no opening Williams score, sort of a duff start.Overall though, see this film."
" Overall boring and uninteresting, but great visuals
",0.7184,0.9923,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla), is the first live action feature film taking place inside the Star Wars universe that isn't part of the episodes. The events take place right before the first Star Wars movie from 1977 and tells the tale of the group of rebels that acquired the plans of the Death Star, as talked about and used in the 1977 movie. The main protagonist of the movie is Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who is part of the rebellion group that stole the secret plans of the Death Star. Now, this movie wasn't necessary at all. Nobody asked or waited for this movie to happen, but it's Star Wars (!), so why on earth wouldn't you want to make another movie taking place in this universe? As long as you get a competent, enjoyable movie out of it, a lot of fans and non-fans won't complain too much about this movie being made. But that's just the problem. While the first sequence of this movie is intriguing, the remainder of the first act and the entire second act are boring, messy and utterly disappointing. You get introduced to many characters on different planets exchanging uninteresting dialogue, and although there are some funny moments and thrilling scenes, the point of it all was lost on me. The other issue, besides the uninteresting events throughout the first and second act, is the character development. And perhaps these two are related. There is no character development. Some characters do have a bad-ass scene or deliver some funny punchlines, but their characterization is so flat that it's truly impossible to care about them. You never get to know anything about them, besides from Felcity Jones' character, they're all simply 'profession characters': Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) is a rebel, Bodhi Rock (Riz Ahmed, great in 'Nightcrawler) is a pilot, Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) fights in this movie. But that's all we know about them, we don't really know their motivations or emotional baggage. This flat characterization had a huge contribution in why the movie was uninteresting. At moments where a lot is at stake, when emotional events occur, you just don't care. It is however a 2016 Star Wars movie, and the visual effects were damn perfect. This movie looked beautiful, better than any Star Wars movie before (besides some CGI persons). The third act was one giant, epic war scene, taking place in an original setting. This third act is where the movie picked up, but still suffered from the flat characters and some cheesy, cliché sequences. There was so much at stake, but again I didn't care about what happened to whom. For the hero-villain climax Gareth Edwards chose one of the oldest clichés in Hollywood. The ending of the movie was interesting, and elevated the story, it was an ending that made sense. It's however sad to realize that the ending could have been perfect and hauntingly beautiful if only Gareth Edwards took the time to make you care about the characters. It's a shame this was never done. But again, the movie looked incredibly good, and should be praised for this aspect. Overall, this movie would have been a train wreck if the visuals weren't this perfect. The visuals, some elements of the third act, and an amazing Darth Vader scene made up a little for the first two acts of the movie, but not enough for it to be a satisfying movie. Now, where does Rogue One fit within the Star Wars movies? It's way better than the prequels, but doesn't reach the level of 'The Force Awakens' and the original trilogy. These movies had great characters and a menacing villain."

",-0.0772,-0.9651,2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"OK where to begin , this movie was visually stunning but sadly not too original i find this movie to be boring and just so long and lame. i find myself not liking the hype i hate when a movie gets hyped up for nothing, Disney already knows the fan base for star wars is immensely huge and easy to sell a star wars story to and make a huge profit. so the story itself was not action packed mainly just talking and boring in dept star wars fillers so i realized that the movie isn't for movie goers it's for star war die hard fans . overall this is for a fan boy anybody with common sense will find this movie absurd and unnecessary. so yes 4/10 stars seems fair at least it had good visuals and a Darth cater cameo/scene."
" Not Bad - Not Great
",0.6754,0.9711,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Well let me preface this with some negativity – the only two 'Star Wars' movies I really liked are (1) ""Star Wars"" (who really cares what they call it now-a-days – I surely do not), and (2) The one with all the little guys running around dressed in 'lhasa apso' outfits. The second movie I mentioned might be weak on plot – but it sure is strong on cuteness. The other movies I painfully sat through and completely forgot everything about them within a day or two. Oh wait - maybe not completely. There was this one redeeming character that I miss dearly. That character would have to be the eternal 'Jar-Jar.' Yes, Jar-Jar may have been the perfect model of bumbling annoyance, at least he was memorable.So with all that being said, on my way to the theater, I really thought I had completely wasted my money. On my part, this was a family outing to the cinema and I lost the vote. Yes – I knew I was going to pay to watch something I expected not to like. But, as Yoda would say, ""Money you wasted – but wasted completely it is not – hmmmmm – ahhh."" Firstly the movie is way too long. About a third of the time was taken up by CGI and useless interactions between pointless cameo-characters – all of this could be deleted and nothing would be missed. If the editors had sliced thirty minutes, this movie would have easily moved into second place on my scale. Yes – this story would even top the cute little-furry-dog-creature movie.Another thing that drove me up the wall was the multiple yelping references to, ""The Force."" Pleasewhine about ""The Force"", once, maybe twice and move onsheesh. On that point, I thought during this ""Star Wars"" time-frame, the Jedi Knights were some kind of a hush-hush mysteriously dangerous group that history forgot and normal space-folks simply refused to talk about. Eh - what do I know – or care for that matter? Other than what I mentioned above, the movie was OK. I do think the script writers actually delivered a really good product, too bad the plot was so muddied with all the lag-time between splashy space-scenes. Needless to say, I was losing interest fast. Ah but not to worry, redemption came in the form of three, late-entry characters. Yes those true heroes of this epic have to be the hairy likes of Baze Mailbus - wielding some awesomely destructive weaponry and a never-back down attitudes, and his bestest buddy, the master of one-liners and martial arts, Chirrut Imwe, and let's not forget K-250, probably the funniest robot - ever. I hate to say it, but without these three additions I would have lost all interest. Nothing bad about Felicity Jones, she was just a bit weak as a stand-alone lead. If the previously mentioned trio had entered sooner, this movie would have been excellent. In closing, I think there was a lot of potential lost. It could have been shortened or Chirrut, K-250 and Baze should have appeared sooner. Felicity and these three would have made for a very entertaining movie. So there were parts of this movie I really enjoyed and I cannot give this thing one star – but it is not deserving of a ten either. For me I am glad I saw it, but doubtful I will watch it again."
" A brand new Star Wars and not a sequel
",-0.5574,0.59,2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"I am sorry to say this film was a major disappointment. The excessive hype led me to expect more. Having seen the other STAR WARS and enjoyed them, I felt there is a basis for my remarks.The story line was difficult to follow and the scenes shifted too quickly to get a firm grasp as to what was going on. This is particularly true of the battle episodes. A war movie, it is, but one could often focus for only a few seconds before another aspect of the battle came up. Less scene shifting and longer exposure was needed. To see droves of storm troopers singlehandedly being mowed down was overdone, too.Some of the visuals were impressive and a few scenic settings attractive. I allude to the beach and sunset scenes. It was a nice touch to have Carrie Fisher appear at the end of the picture, also."

",0.5106,-0.7028,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I watched it last night, and I enjoyed it a lot more than The Force Awakens. Here is what I liked about Rogue One (spoiler-free) 1) It is mostly a war movie, and in that sense it is darker/ grittier /more pessimistic than the mainstream Star War movies 2) Within the ""war-genre"", I would put it in the ""bunch of guys on a mission"" genre, kind of like a Dirty Dozen in space. A bunch of flawed characters have to work together to pull something a lot bigger than them 3) It is mostly Jedi-free. No lightsaber duels (even though there is a 2-3 mins lightsaber scene with an iconic character of the franchise). I have nothing against Jedis but it is nice to see a movie not relying on their presence/ mythology in the Star Wars Universe. 4) There is no A-list actor involved. Again, it is interesting and refreshing to see a Star Wars movie working with some young- not-so-famous people in the lead, and some very good character actors (Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker) in the supporting roleHere is what I did not like 1) Some acting in the smaller roles (e.g the X-Wing pilots) seemed a bit stiff (nothing that would ruin the movie for me anyway) 2) This is more a general comment since it was inevitable, being a prequel to a New Hope, that the story revolved around the Death Star. But with the exception of the prequel trilogy, it looks like the plot of every Star Wars movie has to be centred on that thing: find the plans or whoever has the plans/ find the flaws of the Death Star (or a Super Death Star like in the JJ Abrams movie). I hope in the future they will come up with something different"
" Good movie, but little bit sad without Jedi knights.

By watching this movie, you can know how Princess Leia and R2-D2 get the design drawing of Death Star in the Episode 4. The movie was great and so exciting. Especially I loved a powerful blind monk who believed the ""Force"". I felt a little bit sad because no Jedi knight appeared in this movie. No light-saber actions, no force fighting, no usual ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" opening crawl. But there is no help since it is the world after genocide of Jedi knights. No Jedi knights except Obi-Wan and Master Yoda is still alive. The ending was really sad, but I was encouraged by this movie. I'm really looking forward to watch episode 8.

" Decent, solid addition...
",0.1531,0.9974,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"...not a total work of art, true, but fits well between Episodes III and IV. I enjoyed that it shows the post-Republic galaxy where the opulence has decayed and the stakes have increased. It also carries on the original theme of Rebels challenging a tyrannical Empire, in what seems to be a grittier way than previously seen. The characters do get some development time, a nice change from previous installments where all we know is a name and profession (heck, it took 45 minutes to meet Han Solo in A New Hope, all while NOT knowing Luke's last name?!?!). There are the occasional hiccups in plot, moments where characters seem to care more than they should about each other, too early in the story but I blame that on late extensive reshoots and plot changes. Grand Moff Tarkin was a vast achievement, I was impressed because I could believe it was him (99% of the time). That tech has made huge strides since Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy. I do think the side plot? main plot with Saw Gerrera could have been tightened somehow, but it still held my interest. The Great: Casting, in my opinion, was brilliant. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna made you believe in the Empire-occupied dismal reality their charascters inhabit. The supporting cast, including Alan Tudyk, were also A+. Ben Mendelsohn, you the man, as far as villains go! The plot also fit in seamlessly with A New Hope, much more smoothly than Episodes I-III do with Episodes IV-VI. CGI was nice, tight and special effects in keeping (mostly) with those seen in the older trilogies.The Good: settings, costumes, and musical score were quite good. Like I said, the opulence of the previous era is gone, people wear utility clothing that fit in with A New Hope. I was so happy to see the return of real clothes. The score IS good for a guy who had only six weeks to do it in, not quite John Williams but close enough while still being unique.The Not-so-good: (SPOILERS) CGI Princess Leia was not as good as Tarkin, but this clip is so short it really is easy to ignore. The odd squid-mind reading creature of Saw Gerrera's is not really needed, a modified Imperial round torture probe would have been scarier (that needle on the end, woooah!). Vader. I think he had more plot before reshoots (trailers hinted at it) but really only needed to be at the very end. Scaring everyone in the theater with that hallway appearance. Speaking of the end...It works for me, although I felt awful (SPOILERS) about Jyn and Cassian and their ship that never sailed. It was so close, too! But I felt Rogue One gave A New Hope greater urgency, that the stakes were even higher now because the Rebellion had lost so many lives.So my advice is go see it. Form your own opinion. See how Leia got those plans, and maybe if you rewatch A New Hope, you will see in the opening crawl their efforts come to life as you remember this newest Star Wars story."
" Terrible characters make for a terrible movie
",-0.7351,0.8991,2017-01-05 00:00:00,4,"I have loved Star Wars since day one. I grew up with the prequels, which I now consider half-assed cash-grab attempts, but I recognize the actual reasons why the first ones were great. And it was not because of the X-wings or the Death Star or the lightsaber fights... It was because of great characters, which Rogue One is completely lacking. These characters are empty shells pretending to be characters and it makes the story feel stale and uneventful. Why should I get invested in these action scenes if I don't care what happens to the characters? Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments, particularly near the end. But these moments would have been so much stronger if I felt even the slightest feeling for any of these people. You can wait for the blu-ray with this one."
" Bored to tears
",-0.4588,-0.937,2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I went into this movie with great hope. That being said, I was very let down. The pacing of the movie was slow. The music was terrible. The CGI actors looked terrible. I understand that Tarkin is a central character, but they really missed the boat on the CGI. Look to LOTR movies and Gollum for how to do it.The lip service paid to the fanboys was not needed. Several scenes in the movie were nothing more than fanboy material. Darth Vaders castle scene in particular. As was the last part of the movie with Darth Vader. They tried with the tiny blurb of a screen crawl to make a full fledged movie, but it felt tired. And trying to please the fanboy crowd of Star Wars fans is a bad thing."
" The best Star Wars Movie Yet!
",0.2244,0.992,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Rogue One proved that a Star Wars movie doesn't need a crawl, a lightsaber fight, or a Skywalker in a major role to be truly amazing. And it provided the best example of a true War in the Stars, with realistic action, plenty of death, close calls, drama, and risks. The force was strong with this one, as were the themes of trust, unity, hope, courage, and sacrifice. Jyn and Chirrut were the standout characters, each delivering many of the best moments, and best quotes, in all of Star Wars. To be clear, every character was good, but in these two the themes and ideas at the core of Rogue One resonated. Additionally, it perfectly set up A New Hope down to the last minute, and paid fan service by including many cameos from the original trilogy and references to the TV shows. This movie could not have been better. It was a beautiful, moving, and epic film and the best Star Wars has ever produced. Rogue One is truly one with the force, and the force is with it. It took the next chance, and the next, and it won."
" I expected more from this movie.
",0.0,0.7762,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I am not a star wars fan, but I can enjoy a good movie. In my opinion Rogue 1 had lots of flaws, therefore I could not enjoy it. First of all, I liked the actors and actresses, although some of them had small parts (but there are no small parts...).In the beginning Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen, great actor) says he has to work on this disaster machine. If he doesn't go, the bad guys will find someone else to make this machine. Then why did the bad guys go all the way through the galaxy to find him? There is this planet where Jyn Erso can find a tape to get the blueprint of this disaster machine. To enter this planet you have to go through a circle because the rest of the planet has a protection shield. Really? If a planet has a protection shield, this shield will orbit around other planets and the planet in the shield will crash against the shield. Okay, let's say this is science fiction and somehow it is possible, if I am a bad guy and I invented a shield around a planet, why just one? Why did they not create a back-up shield within the first protection shield? So the good guys have a plan. With a very small spaceship they push a very big spaceship of the bad guys against an other spaceship of the bad guys. And when the big spaceships collide they crash into each other and explode. In reality this could never happen. The big spaceship would only bump against the other big spaceship and that's just it. I wonder why the people who created these images did not say ""wait, this is just stupid"". When I push a big truck against an other big truck with my small car, the trucks will not explode.At the end Darth Vader kills a couple of good guys with his light saber. That looked very stupid. If he has the power to squeeze their throats, why did he bother to wave with his light saber? What was the purpose of Jyn Erso to be in prison at the beginning of the movie? If Jyn Erso had a rough life, how did she manage to keep the crystal she got from her father? If Galen Erso did not know whether his daughter was alive or not, he had not seen her for many years, why did he named the tape after his daughter's nickname? What if his daughter decided to become a chef, why did he put this huge responsibility in her hands and not in the hands of Saw? Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) gets killed by storm troopers. After getting killed Baze Malbus comes over to his friend to say goodbye. Where were the storm troopers at that moment? This movie did not make any sense to me."
" A Succulent thrill ride of Cinematic Masterpiece
",0.765,0.9962,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Rogue One: 9/10Rogue One consisted of basically the highest cinematography the industry has to offer. With Arguably some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, and breathtaking action sequences, Rogue One: A Star Wars story was pretty dang solid in my opinion.I thought it had a compelling story that managed to keep me engaged the entire time, regardless of the fact that everyone knew the ending since 1977.I also appreciated that it was darker tale in the star wars universe, making this movie a fresh telling of a story in the beloved familiar world. Thanks to George Lucas and his design crew; Star Wars is arguably one of the best, and largest universes of design. From its droids, technology, ships, etc, Star Wars is a brilliant and unique constructed reality. I thought Rogue one showcased that beautifully and dove deep into the brilliance of its unique world, without relying on it to carry the story.The variety in the character assemble was strong, with a enjoyable amount of comedy and chemistry overall. With my biggest praise going to the driod character 2-KSO as well. WHAT A GOOD CHARACTER. That being said, main protagonist Jyn could have been a little stronger in my opinion, as to develop more intrigue for her as a character. She was still a good, strong independent character, justperhaps not as dynamic as I was hoping.Not every story can be about the mighty power of Jedi and siths. Sometimes it takes a story about the smaller, more personal group of characters to make an intriguing story, and that is how Rogue One succeeded. Without being about to rely on the classic lightsaber duels and force using action sequences, I thought Rogue One created intrigue through its stylistic warfare sequences and immersion into the scenic design of the Star Wars universe.Something unique Rogue One executed was bringing back to life 1977 Carrie Fischer, and Moff Tarkin, completely with CGI. Instead of skipping over Admiral Tarkin's storyline, because of Peter Cushing's death, they decided to harness of the power of 2016's technology. Personally I thought this was wonderful. It makes sense that they would spend time on Tarkin's character considering the timeline of this movie's story, and they went for it, regardless of no longer having Peter Cushing. My opinion on the CGI is pretty high. For the most part I was blown away by how good it looks. Princess Leia on the other hand.didn't look right to me. The CGI on her struck me as a little bit off. Ironically though, as I was discussing the CGI with the friends I went to the movie with, they had literal opposite impressions. As both me and my brother thought Tarkin looks great and Leia looks mediocre, my two friends thought Tarkin looked Mediocre, and *Leia* looked great. So I suppose that proves something. Wither way, I think CGI has reached a pretty high point in Cinema history, to where I am glad they could harness those tools effectively to tell a good story by including these characters.Let's talk about Darth Vader for a moment; possibly everyone's favorite moments in the movie. He was great. Its funny, because in the first main scene featuring Darth Vader, he engages in a semi- lengthy conversation with Orson Kendrick, and as this scene progressed I realized, this is the most we've ever heard Darth Vader talk! Most of his dialogue before consisted of brief sentences and one liners. So to hear Vader speak for an extended period of time actually expanded our viewpoint of him as a character. In that scene we see him being a little sassy, even using sarcasm, and ending he conversation with a pun! WOW. And of course the most epic scene with Darth Vader taking on Rebel troops like a badass; now that was something. In the original movies, we were used to him being a lot slower in his fighting, due to pace of the scenes & likely some of the technical limitations of that time. But in Rogue One, we finally get to see Vader show off the fierce, Sith lord bad ass he really is.Overall I loved this movie. Gareth Edwards did a phenomenal job, and I can't wait to go see this movie many more times."
" Good, once it gets going
",0.4404,-0.7039,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Rogue One has a slow start and I found I didn't really care very much for the father and daughter relationship that was the basis for the plot. It just wasn't that interesting or compelling. Similarly, most of the new characters were not that compelling either, with the possible exception of Cassian Andor. I had a couple of minor gripes too. In particular, you could sometimes tell that this Star Wars universe wasn't quite the same as the universe of the original trilogy. Those small differences are jarring if you hold the original in the highest regard.The second half of the film was better and the progression to the inevitable climax was very well done. It was the Star Wars universe I had wanted to see and the battles, spaceships and other elements made me happy! So overall I think Rogue One is a good Star Wars film, but not a great one."
" There was nothing Rogue about this film - it truly belongs and adds depth to a promising Disney Star Wars universe.
",0.25,-0.9948,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I very rarely write reviews. The film has to either be so horribly tragic - enough to warrant warning people off, or a film that transcends a conventional movie experience. Thankfully, Roque One is the latter.Firstly I will clarify this; Roque One has some flaws. They're not glaring, but they are there. But at no point during the film did I pause and explicitly curse ""why the f*** did that just happen?!"". Just the inevitable Jame's Bond-esque bullet dodging (or in this case, laser dodging) amongst a couple of other minor things.Anyway, moving on.If you are a moderate to extreme hardcore Star Wars fan, this film is emotional and nostalgic, and something which I think we needed (especially after the three initial prequels). It really is. And the reason I say this film transcends a conventional movie experience is because this film bridges the gap on so many levels leading up to episode IV. It makes you feel the pain, despair, loss and the sacrifice it took to kick start the demise of the Empire. It's a film that isn't just a throwback trying to milk the cash cow Star Wars franchise. It's a film that adds real depth and context, and at least for me, immersed me more into the Empire versus the Rebel Alliance than I ever expected.Without going off on too much of a tangent, we live in politically unstable times. This is a film that myself, and I believe many people will be able to relate to - because a large aspect of the film (and the original Star Wars films) is fighting the establishment and fighting against oppression. Rogue One captured the pure emotion, desperation and anger of the small people fighting against the immovable object. it was beautiful.Without giving any spoilers away, there were some moments in the film which I think would bring a tear to the eyes of any legitimate Star Wars fan.To sum up... a truly nostalgic and emotional film, and everything that I could have hoped for in a meaningful Star Wars story. This is the film we should have had instead of Episodes I-III."
" Better than Force Awakens but not great
",-0.5409,0.9902,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Hmm, where to start, after Force Awakens hit the theaters last year, i said that i will not watch anything new that comes from Disney and has Star Wars in the name, i was so disappointed, even George Lucas prequels where magnificent achievements when you compare them to JJ Abrams directing. But somehow when Rogue One came to theaters in my town i said to myself i would go and watch it, and yes i must admit i had a great fun but nothing more from that, it is action and just action, like watching Rambo movie just set in galaxy far far away. I must admit i like the look of new planets especially planet Jedha, yes you can see the middle eastern influences especially city of Jerusalem but i like that a lot, that part of the movie reminded me on maybe the best star wars video game Knights Of The Old Republic, and yes i had a feeling from the beginning to an end that i am playing some good star wars video game, not watching movie, like mix of Rogue Squadron, KOTOR and Battlefront. Acting in movie is just i don't know what to say but there is no acting, maybe just from Ben Mendhelson as main Villain Orson Krennic, he really looks like ambitious man of Empire real villain without emotions, and Mads Mikkelsen as father of Jyn Erso, others are not worth mentioning, maybe Forest Whitaker but his role was too short. The biggest down was acting of Felicity Jones, so dumb and one of the worst acting i have seen on big screen. Even with all this flaws this movie is better 10 times than Force Awakens and feels more like Real Star Wars, but not expect too much, you will not find great acting, story and emotions and spiritual deepness like in first movies, but if you just want to watch good action, great filming locations, bunch of star destroyers and TIE Fighters these movie is for you. I give it 6/10, even Edwards is better director than Jar Jar Abrams."
" Awesome movie. One of the best Star Wars films!
",0.7177,0.8064,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"What a wonderful movie. It has been a long time since I saw a movie so good and wanted to get back in to see it again. In my opinion this was a much better film than Episode VII. It has characters I enjoyed, and a real feel of fighting a war. It reminded me of older war movies of a small band of soldiers fighting a almost impossible battle. This is what Star Wars films should be.It was well written, the actors did a good job in their roles and the story was one I found entertaining. It moved along at a good pace that held my attention and before I knew realized it was over. I would very much enjoy seeing these writers and this director do another movie within the Star Wars time line."
" Satisfying, But With a Pervasive Sense of Untapped Potential
",0.25,0.9542,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"After two viewings, I remain uncertain how to feel about ""Rogue One"". Originally, I was prepared to label it a depreciation from ""The Force Awakens"", but the second round was notably more enjoyable, and leaves me regarding it, for the time being, as more or less on the same level as the 2015 feature. Whatever the case, this is an unorthodox, sometimes frustrating and sometimes poignant addition to the Star Wars canon.On the level of functionality as a prequel, ""Rogue One"" is adequate. It reveals the events that led up to the beginning of ""A New Hope"", much of which is entertaining, but little of which enhances the pertinent conflict. Too much of the runtime is devoted to either gathering the main group or shallow attempts at a typical war movie moral ambiguity; it's a needless complication that further affirms that the people behind these movies are all too insistent on bowing down to fan demands. Keeping track of numerous individuals and agendas can be moderately difficult, but this problem is significantly reduced in subsequent viewings, after one understands where everything is headed. Strangely, substantial numbers have objected to the film's dependence on the context provided by ""A New Hope"". Oh my, the EIGHTH entry in an iconic, long established film series assumes familiarity with that series? What an outrage! How dare they make a Star Wars movie specifically geared towards Star Wars fans? As has been trumpeted in most circles, the large cast of characters is underdeveloped. It is notable, however, that most everyone is given a personal reason for being involved. These aren't fully capitalized on, but they are there, and bring just enough substance to the key players to make their endeavors engaging. Jyn Erso, despite some good fighting scenes, doesn't resonate for most of the runtime. Her ideally solid motivations aren't given weight until the mission at Skarif, when she gets to act upon them. More interesting aspects of her character, such as her family's belief in the Force and her ability to lift morale, are underutilized. Cassian Andor is notably better, and the only member of the group convincingly molded by war. ""Rogue One"" should have devoted much more effort to this angle of exploring how the war effected people on a personal level, rather than shoehorning an overly clamored for moral grayness.The villains are overall better, primarily because of familiar faces. Krennic is a letdown. Though he certainly stands out with his distinctive white uniform, he falls victim to the bewildering new trend of turning Star Wars villains into pathetic pretenders in a cheap attempt to elicit sympathy. Plus, his attempts at humor are out of place.Some were quick to criticize Vader's final scene as intrusive, unnecessary and inappropriate, claiming that it overrides the impact of the climax. Considering the greater context and the villain's purpose in the movie, I would say different. Vader's inclusion here (essentially an extended cameo) is preparatory to his role in ""A New Hope"", and his final scene builds momentum and anticipation as ""Rogue One"" segues into the conflict of the succeeding chapter. Additionally, the transmissions, the fruits of the main characters' efforts, are also followed during these final scenes, keeping the significance of the climax alive.Gareth Edwards once again shows a talent for impressive sights, and ""Rogue One"" is filled with great looking settings and excellent cinematography. While this is yet another instance of answering fan complaints, specifically the abundant use of green-screen in the prequel trilogy, it brings a sense of scope that helps set this entry apart from its immediate predecessors. Nevertheless, most of these places work better as sights (and very good ones, to be sure) than supplements to the story. Jedha, for example, feels less like a city ravaged by war than a settlement that has simply always been harsh. Any undercurrent of suffering or struggle fails to manifest itself. As is, the visuals mostly amount to the ""used future"" concept dialed up to 11. ""Rogue One"" needed more moments like the scene aboard Andor's ship after the escape from Jedha, where one can feel how shaken the group is by recent events.The end battle is an ambitious application of the multi-faceted climax structure first seen in Episode VI. The space engagement is top notch, while the ground battle is a definite improvement over its Endor counterpart. At times, it is easy to lose track of the proceedings, but if one pays attention it is impressive how everything is planned. Furthermore, this is the primary segment of the film to carry narrative weight in the larger context (although the stakes are clear even when only considering this film). The actual procedure of stealing the technical readouts is a little protracted and could have used more involvement by the main group, but it does what it has to. It creates a sense of challenge and commitment, and gives the heroes opportunity to contribute to something critical. My only issue with this sequence is the palm tree filled setting. It's disconnected from the style seen in the rest of the film, and makes the battle seem more like it takes place in Malibu. Regardless, the closing scenes are terrific.""Rogue One"" is a reasonably entertaining and at times bold addition to the film series. It provides further background on the original story, gives us a few good actions sequences and memorable moments. Nevertheless, it's high time the series broke away from the Galactic Civil War. Filmmakers are going to have to move past the restrictions imposed upon them by fan complaints if they intend to expand the horizons of this franchise. Otherwise, the day will not be far off when the great Roger Ebert's comment on Star Trek in 2002 will also apply here: ""gradually it occurs to me that ""Star Trek"" is over for me. I've been looking at these stories for half a lifetime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas""."
" A movie without surprised and mediocre acting
",-0.1695,-0.95,2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,I was very disappointed by this movie. The story was one cliché connected with another. No surprises. Only action and more action. It is very predictable. I expected at least a reasonable story but halfway this movie I thought it was a waste of money. I have seen all the star wars movies in cinema and this one was the biggest disappointment! If you like action watch it! If you like a story with it turn around and go home! My son of 16 agreed with me about thus episode. Sad how they can destroy a franchise! Only one character jumped out : Darth Vader The other characters were extremely blunt and did not make an impression on me and my son. At the end the two main characters die! My son remarked that this was good because he didn't want to see them again in a next episode. So I don't agree with the majority of the reviewers who adore this movie. The only reason why I gave it at least 4 stars was the quality of the special FX.
" Star Wars as A Bridge Too Far
",-0.5574,0.9533,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I was a bit wary of the star wars spin off stories when I first heard they were coming, and I'm still a bit apprehensive about the young Han Solo movie and I've never had any interest in a Boba Fett film, but if they're all to the quality of this then we've nothing to worry about. In fact if they live up to this then run to the cinema on the first day. I love the way this expands the universe but feels thoroughly grounded in and bonded to the originals. Its far darker in tone than much of the rest of the Star Wars universe and much of the humour of a Leia, Han or even a Po Dameron or a Finn is missing. But this is a war film after all and the stunning final act brings this home with the best and most realistic battle sequences ever in Star Wars. Some have marked this film down as they had no empathy or feel for the new set of characters but I had none of these problems and re-watches only made me feel more for the sacrifices they were making in the hope for a better future. Another so called problem was the CG re-creations of original characters but for me this helped bond this to A New Hope, for sure they were not perfect, but many people who did not know they were re-creations did not even notice. And to top it off we get probably the most bad ass Darth Vader scene we'll ever see. Superb."
" First half: boring and characterless, second: Epic and amazing to grand proportions!
",0.6996,0.9346,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I went in to this movie and didn't know what to expect, since I saw this movie as a watershed for what people thought of it. I want to divide this movie-review into two parts, the first stretching from the opening scenes to just before the rebels get to Scarif. Hence the second from the Scarif opening point till the end.Beginning with the first part, the characters are presented and the premise is slowly but steady being set into action. However, the story that you are being told raises more questions than answers, in my opinion. That can be summarized into the plot-characters being pretty bland and questionable in their opinions. For example: Saw Gerrera's and Jyn's relationship isn't shown and told that much and makes the viewers feeling indifferent to the moment when you are supposed to feel for them. Another example is Jyn's opinions regarding the rebellion. She starts by saying that the Empire's possible ruling over the galaxy, isn't a that big of a deal if you just: ""don't look up on the flag"". And then later makes a fast turn and openly speaks on the rebel- meeting about they must continue to fight the Empire! This is not clear why she just switched her opinion that quickly, because of the plot maybe? But hey, no more cynicism, for now I will continue with the second part (AKA the part that makes this movie and raises my 7 rating to an 8). When the rebel-squad led by Cassian and Jyn, arrives on Scarif and whole hell breaks loose, the movie changes rapidly for the better. The action and battles are amazing, the plot is instantly better and more interesting and the characters that are brought forward are recognizable and thereby more likable, in my opinion. It's epic, good looking, funny, sad and jaw dropping all at the same time, watching the rebels taking on the Empire. The ""multiplot"" that sets into action during this part, with the audience being allowed to follow several plot-characters and their whereabouts, works very well and unites good in the ending. Also seeing Darth Vader kick some butt was very pleasing and a nice touch.Story: 7 Characters: 6 Effects: 9 Fan pleasing: 10 Overall it gets an 8 from me, first part being an weak 7 or almost an 6."
" Finally! A Worthy Star Wars Movie
",-0.2481,0.9305,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"As a die hard Star Wars Fan(atic), I can finally say the guys at Walt Disney and LucasFilm finally got it right.Rogue One mixes the best elements of an original story, great fight sequences and absolutely little or no cheesy scenes. It reminded me a lot of the original trilogy.All the actors did an amazing job and the film was exciting even without the presence of any Jedi Knights. There was a lot of easter eggs and fan homage throughout the movie. The only single gripe I had was with the special effects used on Peter Cushing. In this time and age, I thought we had the technology to do anything! The actor looked pretty fake, but this does not ruin the movie in ANY way. Some may not even notice.I hope we get to see more of these types of Star Wars movies that are original and geared towards mature audiences. Star Wars has amazing material and you have to try really, really hard to screw up a movie. I'm quite pleased with Rogue One and recommend it to even non-die hard fans."
" Convoluted Nonsensical Garbage
",0.0,-0.9952,2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie should be called Starwars 3.9, A Convoluted Plot involving the Deathstar.Here is the plot so you don't have to waste your money: The Deathstar project manager, clueless as ever, decides to employ a man as chief architect of the Deathstar despite knowing that he ardently against it and despite the fact they he just had his wife brutally killed in front of him.So in the first 10 minutes we are given the premise 1) That Darth Vader would be happy about a potential saboteur designing the Deathstar 2) That this guy is the only person capable of building the Deathstar in the entire universe 3) That anyone in the Empire would believe this guy had had a change of mind after his wife had been brutally killed.Fast forward a decade or two and we have an hour of irrelevant story involving Jyn and some rebel dude, who I have to say kills more people than Darth Vader. They all run around meeting (and often killing) irrelevant people, Forest Whitaker. They plot to kill Jyn's father, who we all know isn't really evil, but none of the characters know that. Since the Deathstar is already fully functional, the only purpose for this seems to be a good old revenge killing. It's nice of the rebels to leave Darth Vader alone.After they achieve their goal, and with his croaky dying breath, Jyn's father reveals to Jyn that he only agreed to build the Deathstar so he could engineer in a secret weakness - because if he hadn't built it, someone else would have ... which destroys the entire premise (see above).However, his secret engineered weakness is so secret that he decided not to tell anyone, and instead was relying on some rebels turning up so he could tell them before they killed him - the rebels do a lot of that. It was just luckily that he was only mostly dead and got to tell them before he was completely dead.Unfortunately, since Jyn was the only person to hear this croaky confession, no one will believe her. So she and a small group, the rebel rebels, head off to find the proof from planet archive. Meanwhile Peter Cushing has returned from the dead to do some acting that Keanu Reeves would be proud of thanks to CGI.There is a big battle, they get the plans, no one cares because both sides seem as murderous as each other, Jyn and rebel dude kiss, everyone is killed, and Pricess Leah flies off with a Wifi version of the Deathstar plans. The end. And we don't even get any of the original Starwars music to enjoy.Whoever wrote the story to this utterly boring film should be sacked!"
" The war continues: Rouge One
",-0.5994,0.023,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Rouge One is the latest episode of the Star Wars series, although it isn't the part of the official series. It explains what happened in the original first episode. The script is more understandable than in the other episodes, therefore you can watch the film without subtitles. There are some accents in the film but overall it is OK. I liked that the music was a remake of the original Star Wars music, yet it was contemporary. It was interesting to get to know that the beach fight scenes were shot at the Maldives because I was there a few months ago. In the cast, there aren't any famous actors and I was disappointed about the fact that Han Solo didn't appear in the film. The 3D special effects were awesome. This episode is more about fighting and destruction than sci-fi. As a result, - although I am not a Star Wars fan - I liked this episode and I recommend it to everybody."
" So bad I had to write my first review
",-0.5849,-0.9334,2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie will only appeal to you if you are under aged or a simpleton.Negatives: Felicity Jones does some of the worst acting I've ever seen.The robotic sidekick's (don't even care about its name) jokes feel very forced.Stormtroopers are even weaker than in previous movies, die by looking at them and misfire as if they have cataract.Some one liners make you cringe.You don't care about the characters.The movie is cliché riddled.Only plus sides for me were the visuals (best space battles yet) and the score (though many disliked this as well, but that is probably because all they want to hear is the main theme and the imperial death march on repeat)."
" An epic success after an epic failure
",0.1027,0.9397,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"After the epic failure in SW Episode Vii my expectations for this movie were quite poor, however I couldn't miss this film. The film is a success. Having a rather simple plot, it manages to sustain the true atmosphere of the universe, reviving the golden era of the Emprire and the rebels. Most characters are not as plain as they could be, with an inner conflict and doubts. And it fulfills the ""Good-SW-Movie"" checklist, there are: a nice female protagonist, a passionate leader, a space fleet battle, a blind almost-a-jedi, a self-sacrifice, an intelligent humorous droid and ofc a Darth Vader. As a bonus it contains some truly dramatic moments and a rather bitter ""happy end"". Definitely, worth to be watched!"
" OK Movie
",0.4466,0.9614,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Although it carries the magic of the Star Wars name, ""Rogue One"" is just another big, rather soulless Hollywood drama. I can't say I didn't get my ten dollars worth but there are episodes of ""The Vikings"" I'd rather watch. I actually enjoyed the ""The Force Awakens"" a lot more than I enjoyed this one. I felt the chemistry and tension between Jin and Cassian worked pretty well, although the reprogrammed droid was probably the most interesting character. Darth Vader's appearances are pointless and uninspired. ""Rogue One"" is an interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, but the battle scenes do go on a bit. Forest Whitaker's character was certainly an incomplete and puzzling one--I suppose most moviegoers were familiar with his character going in. Here's hoping episode 8 lives up to the hype"
" Disney, Is it too much to ask, to let me be the next Star Wars Writer\Editor, because your people DO NOT KNOW STAR WARS!
",-0.1092,-0.9952,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Is it just me, or did anyone else wonder the same thing as me after watching this film, saying to myself, WHAT, WHY, and HOW? What in blazes afternoon was princess Leia doing at a gunfight above the planet crapola? Why was there a war, instead of a covert operation that was missing? So much for a the AT-ACT surprise in Episode V where it belongs for revenge as a unstoppable force, instead to a complete wreckage of garbage dumpheap for our eyes. Totally out of place. I give the movie a 6 for the old time sake, but not more then that. Again, way, way, too many flaws, and parts that needed to be cut out of movie entirely, like the wasted first 15 minutes. Disney please just call me, I could have made a better script, and actually follow episode IV to the T, I'll give the the audience a movie that they should have had, and with such conspiracy elements, that you would be forced to make a movie in the Clone Wars just to satisfy this movie. I could make you trillions instead of millions on what Darth Vader should have done in that movie, along with Tarkin, and also those wannabe first episode (IV) patriots that stole a ship?, that sacrificed there lives in bringing this information with a war? And brought with them Red 5, and Gold Leader?, to steal the most highly secured plans in the universe?, should have done. AKA, it's sort of been done already, a film with Tom Cruise, its called mission impossible, that no one on the production must have not ever watched. The missing link of creatures was out of this film too (how come bugs in episode II come up with the Idear of destruction, but can't help build it, or belong in the science team?!), along with Storm troopers are treated mostly like incapacitated morons for the most part, too much cgi (and if you are going to use cgi, it would have been nice to see the freaking Death Star move in Light speed on the screen!), and where the crap planet are we? It was so all over the place, I thought for a moment even a person like me who knows Star Wars so well was lost. My biggest beef with this movie is the primary flaw of how Leia got the stolen transmissions, what in tar-nations happened with the several transmissions were beamed aboard this ship from episode IV? Maybe it was lost in the translation of where the crap was Luke Skywalker in episode VII? Can we please just go back to Episode IV and V, watch it and realize that this will never be done again?"
" A wasted opportunity: incapable of departing from tired storytelling conventions
",-0.7096,-0.4912,2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"This movie will make you wish for John Williams' amazing composing skills. The music is too loud, and has no memorable or hummable melodies. As for the rest of the movie, it is too loud with explosions. In terms of story, Rogue One is so weighed down by formulaic Hollywood story conventions that it slips into the mire and loses momentum. When Cassian gets 'secret' orders to kill Jyn Erso's father, you know it will not happen. It does not. However, our 'good' sniper also has senior Empire leader Krennic in his sights, but does nothing! Of course, they have to keep Krennic alive to have a face to face showdown with Jyn. Really Disney, take a few chances with your story-telling and risk alienating the fanboys and fangirls.What a waste of a fifth of a billion dollars!"
" By the Numbers - but quality
",0.0,0.7537,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Overall, an enjoyable movie. I've had an issue with Felicity Jones since the abysmal Theory of Everything. Her performance here definitely changed my mind.The plot is moderately predictable. It feels as if we've all seen this setup before. And yet, everything is done well. There are no glaring flaws. On the other hand, nothing special occurs. While it does not live up to the high standard set by The Force Awakens, Rogue One achieves its goal: make a good Star Wars prequel. Compared to the infamous ones from years past, this is much better.For an enjoyable couple of hours, look no further."
" Went in with low expectations and thank goodness for that
",0.5267,-0.9902,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"After the alright, but a bit disappointing episode VII The Force Awakens I heard they were making another prequel while we wait for episode VIII. When I heard what the story was about my expectations were really bad, and it became even worse when I saw the final trailer, it looked so bad I didn't even want to watch the movie. It felt like a quick cash grab of a movie, but my brother and cousin said it was far better than it looked like on the trailers. Heck, my cousin said it was better than VII, so naturally I had to watch it, if mostly that was to get to have my own opinion.The story takes place between episode III and IV, and it serves as a prequel to the latter rather than a sequel to the former. Basically the entire story is about making sense of a 39 year old plot hole from the first Star Wars movie (which retroactively became episode IV). It was never explained how such a flawless looking station like the Death Star could even be destroyed, however here they retcon that to make it so that the fatal flaw was planned out by the builder of it who was charged to work on it against his will, and it's now up to his rebel daughter to get this information and send it to the rebel alliance.To sum up the rest of the movie, I thought it was in the bad to meh range. Didn't care about a single one of the characters, the dialogue was mostly bad, thought a lot of the acting was also pretty bad, some of the fighting scenes were alright, but most of them were laughably clichéd. Especially the final climax which included pretty much every single action movie cliché that exists and by that point I just wanted the movie to be over as soon as possible. (Spoiler warning) The Darth Vader portions at the end were decent, but it sadly lasted only a couple of minutes.I feel like I also have to address the retcon. (this might be considered a spoiler depending on your perspective) I have to suspend my disbelief by a lot when you consider the fact that Mads Mikkelsen's character had many other co-workers working on the Death Star. All of them seemed very loyal to the empire. It's hard for me to swallow that not a single one of them noticed the flaw he had created in the architecture and informed the bosses of it.Overall a half hearted movie, with half hearted acting. 5 out of 10."
" If this was not ""A Star Wars Story,""
",0.4449,-0.9462,2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"would you still be interested in viewing it? Pretend for a moment that this was a stand-alone film. Was it any good? I don't think so. I fell asleep at 5:30 PM watching this on a vacation day between Christmas and New Year's. My 14 year old son sitting next to me elbowed me with this quip, ""You're snoring."" I was, and replied, ""I'm sorry. Its boring."" ""I know,"" was his response. That about sums it up. I didn't care about the characters; I did not care if they lived or died or succeeded in their mission--even though going into the movie I knew that they had succeeded. Luke blew up the Death Star about 40 years ago after the Death Star blueprints were stolen. I don't care how they were stolen nor who stole them and neither did my son. The only reason this movie was made was because it was a money grab. 4 / 10 and I'm being very generous. Shame on you, Disney."
" Star Woes...
",0.0,-0.8745,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Most reviews on this site I basically agree with so I won't repeat that stuff. I liked it but was not engaged like I wanted to be. I will nit-pick on stuff that took me out of the film. Simple logic problems that could have easily been avoided if someone took the time probably the director. 1. This has nothing to do with the film itself but we were exposed to 11 commercials and then only 3 trailers, all of which were high concept sequels AND then to yet another commercial for Cineplex before the film started. When did this become the norm? Yikes. 2. when the shuttle lands to pick up Galen and fam they land a mile awayfor no reason other than the Imperials on board need the exercise I suppose. 3. when the X-Wings attack the base where Galen and the Scientists are held, the shuttle that is on the landing pad between them and the attacking fighters, is not hit or destroyed even though it is a huge target. I am sure if it was hit in the right place it would produce a cool fire ball and explosion. If I were one of the Rebel pilots that would be my first thought of attack. But I guess they don't teach that in Rebel fighter school. 4. I have no qualms with a female hero or one that is sexy, pretty much a given within the film world for the past 100+ years but aren't we sick of ""heroes"" who can fight better/stronger/faster than any living human being? Uber choreographed fights that would make Bruce Lee's head spin? I am. At least Bruce could do the things he did on film, not so for 99% of these actors who seem to be doing it on a never ending basis in every other film released in the past 20 years. I can't sympathize with a hero who does super human feats and isn't a super hero. I can barely stand it when a super hero does it. 5. The rebel Blockade runner which rams into the Star Destroyer to push it to the other Star Destroyer; it seems the head of the blockade Runner is made of solid metal and suffers minor damage when colliding into the behemoth, yet both Star Destroyers seem to crumble like crackers when they collide at the same speed with each other. Maybe they were built by the lowest bid contractor and instead of metal substituted plywood instead to cut costs better spent on the Death Star. 6. A lot of people are jumping on the CG Tarkin and Leiayeah they aren't perfect but since everyone KNOWS that both are dead (or even those that saw the film before Carrie passed away knew it could not be her 19 year old self), we are naturally focused on scrutinizing the effects, just as I was even though I knew they were coming up in the film. It's better to have them in and flawed than to totally eliminate them from the story. Either way you can't win. I am sure there are many more but those are ones that jumped out at me upon fist viewing."
" ""Rebellions are built on hope.""
",-0.2732,-0.9227,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I had a good feeling coming out of this film - both times. I saw it the first time before the news of Carrie Fisher's passing, the second time after. Knowing that she won't be around for the final chapter, (Episode VIII is already filmed as I understand it), adds a note of poignancy to the franchise, seeing as how forty years - FORTY YEARS! - have passed since ""A New Hope"" came out to thrill legions of movie fans.What this film did in it's own way was to bring back some of the magic I felt was missing with ""The Force Awakens"", the latest movie of the series from just a year ago. That might have had something to do with characters from the original films appearing here, I'm thinking of ones like Governor Tarkin (not yet Grand Moff), Mon Mothma, Darth Vader and of course Princess Leia at the stunning conclusion of this story. That minor scene of R2-D2 speaking with C-3PO was exceptionally well played, especially since it wasn't overdone. When I say this, I guess it's the traditionalist coming out in me. It's that magic feeling we all had back when the series started that I look for with each new entry in the Star Wars Universe, and this picture delivered some of that.On the flip side, I don't know if the new characters introduced here will resonate with me in the same way as time goes by. Even the heroes didn't seem to be particularly likable to me. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) I think had the capacity for further development, but his death in the story leaves him out. Though they were OK, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna didn't have the charisma to become bigger players in the franchise, but since this is a stand alone story that probably doesn't matter. For whatever reason, K-2SO just struck me the wrong way, even if he was a robot.But with all said and done, this was an effective story to explain how the Rebel Alliance paved the way for stealing the plans for the Death Star, something we could only guess at forty years ago if one had a mind to think about it. There was even a cautionary hint of the Rebels operating outside the law so to speak, in going up against the Empire. I thought that was an intriguing concept. More than anything though, what the film did for me was send me back to the movie archives to experience the Star Wars saga once more, all over again. And that can only be a good thing."

Giachinno's it is a good composer, but only just goes as expected...there is no tears of geniality as had with John Williams...The soundtrack is not bad, it is good, but a movie cannot reach the class of ""Great"" without a great soundtrack. And Star Wars success owes much to John Williams music...Of course that he is irreplaceable!...Also the 3D effects are nothing of special!...But I hope to continue to have more and more Star Wars episodes!"
" Battlefront: A Star Wars Story
",-0.7003,-0.3077,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Disney looks to further cash in on its four billion dollar investment by making a prequel that precedes the events of ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" chronicles the daring mission the rebel spies undertook to steal the Death Star plans. Rogue One has what you would expect: amazing special effects, exhilarating action, engaging story, and fine performances, but also adds rare complexity, grittiness, and easter eggs that does the old films justice. Yet what holds it back from topping last year's ""The Force Awakens"" is its erroneous mindset that bigger is better, its narrative flaws, and its awkward flow the ending leaves for ""A New Hope.""""Rogue One"" delivers on what fans wanted. The action scenes are gripping and capture the same intensity as a war movie. The special effects are state of the art, as usual. The story is exciting and patches up the plot hole from the first film of an all-powerful Death Star having such an exploitable weakness. The acting and writing are also perfectly fine. Director Gareth Edwards displays a meticulous attention to detail (like making sure the costumes and technologies fit well with the original films). He also never misses a moment for easter eggs and Star Wars nerdom (Red Five, old X-wing pilots to name a few). ""Rogue One"" takes the next step in its franchise's filmography with its darker tone, war movie-like battles, and deeper thought-provoking themes. Having the rebellion vs Empire feud not seem so black and white was another great aspect because it offered for some rare complexity we normally don't see in a Star Wars movie.""Rogue One"" features a whole new entourage of characters with a few familiar cameos. Some of the most memorable are Donnie Yen's blind yet still lethal 'Force' enthusiast Chirrut Îmwe (who supplies the funniest line in the movie). Also there is the ambitious and cunning Orson Krennic played brilliantly by Ben Mendelsohn. There are plenty of others but those two are my personal favorite. The only problem with these characters is that you don't feel as emotionally attached to them as you did with the characters in the original trilogy, and even ""The Force Awakens,"" making for a less effective conclusion.Though just like ""The Force Awakens,"" the film was never going to be perfect because Edwards (maybe the studio) chose to deliver the fans what they wanted instead of what they needed. The biggest gripe with this film is the obligatory final act. The final act doesn't flow well with the timeline of ""A New Hope."" The battle is so grandiose in its ambitions that it fails to logically set up ""A New Hope."" So then ""A New Hope"" would start out where Princess Leia is like ""we are on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan,"" and Darth Vader be like ""b@!$h you just blew up half our fleet!"" The scene that perfectly epitomizes the unnecessary overkill and pompousness of the third act was when Darth Vader wrecks twenty rebel soldiers who were trying to safely deliver the Death Star plans. The scene was completely unnecessary, and total overkill. It had potential to be the best scene in the movie but just fell flat and arguably was the worst scene in the movie. Also, the whole thing with the majority of the Rebel council declining the decision to attack Scariff was a bit ridiculous because they decided not to attack, then all of a sudden they send in a huge fleet to get the plans based off some sketchy criminal's claims (Jyn in this case). Like really, they risk all of that without any proof that Jyn is telling the truth.""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" was like the video game Star Wars Battlefront. It was all-out war between pawns. It focused completely on the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Empire. It had no Jedi story lines, lightsaber duels or any sign of the Force. It was all about the grunts fighting in this war, and really excelled with its depiction of warfare and how the rebellion affected these characters. Exploring new themes and bringing a war movie-feel really helped this film feel refreshingly new. Yet it suffered from its lofty ambitions to wow its audience with huge space battles that maimed the continuity it had with ""A New Hope."" Overall ""Rogue One"" is another success and satisfied its audience with enough Star Wars magic to overcome its flaws. This was a good appetizer until we get the full meal in ""Star Wars: Episode VIII."""
" Dear Star Wars
",-0.25,-0.9993,2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"Dear Star Wars, how are you? I am doing good. Let's get to the point, I have a problem with you. I can't enjoy you. I was born way after you and saw two of your films A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back during my cynical teenage years, and I admit your movies are entertaining but they didn't live up to the expectation. That's not a bad thing, I still appreciate you for what you are and what you did to the entire industry but unfortunately I can't enjoy you like the fans of the franchises can. I want to, really bad, but your expectations are incredibly high and the pop culture already showed us what you are multiple times. I skipped The Force Awakens for exactly that, less than a week passed and already I was spoiled of the whole thing and already there was a hype, maybe it was a mistake, I don't know, I will probably visit that film when I am less cynical. However, your new film, Rogue One, seemed like a good gateway for people that want to get into Star Wars but can't because of the situation we are in. It didn't, it was still entertaining from time to time but I can't say I became a fan of your franchise after this movie, here are the reasons. 1. The characters are ""cool"" but that's mostly it. I like the characters in your movie, they were cool and memorable. My favourite one is probably Chirrut Îmwe as his way of detecting enemies even though he was blind was awesome, and he had a funny side of him. Actually, most of them were interesting but I didn't care about them. Everybody in the movie had a single trait and a skill, because of that feel one dimensional. I don't really know the story behind them and why each of them were so inclined to follow Jyn Erso. (mostly, there's evil and we must stop it) Like at the end of the movie I feel like I learned not that much about the characters and I didn't feel emotional attachment to any of them. 2. Death of the characters were predictable My favourite death in your movie was K2SO's death. His slow death felt was more emotional than the death of Jyn Erso, or any of the death of the Rogue One crew. Because each characters would fulfill their duty and then die immediately. Most of the characters had one thing they had to do and then die. That's why I guess Jyn Erso's death wasn't a big emotional moment for me. In the span of 5-10 minutes all the main characters died. I was tired of it, what's the point? It would be so awesome if one character dies without fulfilling his quest. It would be a emotional moment and as he is dying he would regret it and think that he jeopardized the mission. Even the villain Krennic basically served his antagonist purpose and then died immediately. (I did like how his death was handled, as he is staring at basically his creation killing him). 3. Villains were meh. Krennic was so blend. He could be so menacing, but he wasn't. He was so understated when he could be bigger and when he should be understated he feels caricature. He is ambitious, I get that but he is not that scary. He doesn't have that legendary presence like the Emperor, Vader or even Tarkin has. The second villain Tarkin, other than for one scene when he would give motivation to Krennic, felt useless. Why is he in this movie? I am struggling to remember if his presence shifted the story at all and unlike in A New Hope he doesn't feel like a force to be reckoned with. Part of them maybe due to the CGI character, which sometimes looked like an animated character in a middle of a live action set. Or maybe it's the fact that he feels crammed in to show the connection to the main saga and to please the fans. Finally Vader, who also seems to be a fan service, as in the story he doesn't do a great deal however when he does something it's meaningful. His hallway fight was amazing and he felt like a legend every time he was in the screen. Vader was great and could have been the main antagonist but he was in screen for a such a small time that his character kinda feels wasted.4. The world. I know that the biggest thing about you Star Wars is the lore and the world, then why the heck did you introduce all the planet's name in the bottom left hand corner? That's so lazy and doesn't tell anything. Also the landscape changes a lot so we can't stay at an interesting place so that we can get adjusted to it.Those are my main problems. There are some great things about you, the technical aspect of you are amazing, and you aren't using the main franchise to convince the moviegoers to watch this film. I was also entertained here and there but unfortunately your latest film Rogue One didn't convince me to join Club Star Wars. You might say that I am being unfair to your new movie simply because it is a part of you and in some aspect, I am. I am judging this film by high standard because it has your name on it. People flock to the theatres if a movie is connected to you, I get why but you haven't shown me why. This film was average. This film didn't show me why so many people find Star Wars endearing. I want to get to know you, Star Wars but you aren't trying hard enough. Be risky, emotional, great.Show me you deserve the praise.Sincerely, an asshole on the internet"
" Entertaining enough but mercilessly dark
",0.2382,-0.9547,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"If you're into the Star Wars odyssey by all means, pay the money, and see this one on the big screen. If you're even a lukewarm fan of the franchise, sure, go have a look because the film is visually entertaining with some interesting effects, in particular, the light and shadow effects as planets and spacecraft move around their respective suns. Notice I am not using words like ""outstanding"" or ""stunning"" because nothing about this movie qualifies for either of those adjectives, and yet it held my interest for two hours and 13 minutes but left me with very little to applaud.The story is familiar and the lines spoken by the actors are nothing new but not so much so that I was left shaking my head or groaning though I did find myself sighing many times toward the end as the movie packed in one trouble after another and the dreadful denouement loomed large. Momentary bright spot: The robot, voiced by Alan Tudyk, thankfully speaks his lines in a matter-of-fact way that was a blessed relief from all previous ""cute"" robots. And he had some good lines too. He is a complete departure from the earlier robots in that he's not there to appeal to children but rather simply there as comedic relief in this mercilessly dark story. Which brings me to my main criticism of this film.SPOILERS AHEAD!! (Consider yourself warned) . . . . . I really did not like this movie once the story was told and done. I walked out of the theater feeling disgusted and gloomy, and that's not what I pay the price of a ticket to do. I go to movies to be impressed, amused, and diverted from my cares. To me that's actually the definition of ""entertainment"". But a movie where everyone dies is not entertaining. And if the writers of this movie honestly think they redeemed this dismal exercise in death by having the final word in their script be ""hope"" they are naive and completely underestimate the power of the medium from which they've chosen to make a living.So, for the die-hard fans, sure, go, enjoy the special effects. For the rest of us who would rather not see a movie entirely devoted to death and destruction, save your money. For all it's good points, Rogue One is a miserable movie with nothing to offer but death. And right now in reality on planet earth with apocalyptic nihilists running around indiscriminately murdering people Rogue One seems particularly ill- timed and unhelpful. And no, I'm not comparing the rebels to terrorists but I am saying we, humans, have enough real death in our lives already. We don't need even more of it in our ""entertainment""."
" Much better than The Force Awakens.
",0.4404,0.9783,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Mild Spoilers!First off, I was very disappointed with The Force Awakens. I mean very very disappointed. Other than the fact that its plot is an obvious rip off of A New Hope, the nonchalant destruction of the bigger badder Death Star (Starkiller Base) is what especially killed it for me. I was so completely disappointed with The Force Awakens that I held off watching Rogue One. The fact that this movie is also centered around a Death Star (albeit the original) further made me unsure about seeing this movie. In the end I did see it and was not disappointed. In fact, It might be the best overall Star Wars movie in my opinion. In a New Hope, we knew that people had died to get the Death Star plans. Although a scant detail, it added weight to the Death Star's ultimate demise. We also saw the effort princess Leia and the others went through to get the information to the rebel base and the near impossible shot Luke needed to take to make it all work. In Rogue One we actually got to see all the bloodshed needed to get those plans. As a result A New Hope looks better but The Force Awakens looks even stupider. That ten second meeting where they figure out how to completely destroy Starkiller Base with some explosives, shortly after learning about its existence, feels almost insulting. Whereas Luke's miraculous shot is all the more fulfilling. Because Rogue One is a prequel mostly absent of the usual main characters, the characters did not have the usual plot armor. As such there are a lot of character deaths which adds a certain realism to this movie. This felt like an actual war. The visuals were all very nice and there were no glaring plot holes that I noticed or couldn't readily accept. Dark Vader's scenes where all great. We even got Imperial Walkers which I love for some weird reason!The humor was mostly great. I'd say the probability that you'll also find the humor to be great is very high. There was plenty of action of course. Perhaps more then any other film, and the end ties in nicely with the beginning of a New Hope. And I just love those wacky white helmets!A great movie overall. I definitely recommend it."
" Overrated, but not bad.
",0.5824,0.9161,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Many are praising this movie saying its the best star wars yet and its better than the force awakens but sadly, i disagree. i don't believe it was bad but i don't believe it was great. I would like to start this review with the positives. I loved the entire Battle on Scariff. It was ruthless and intense, like a ""Saving Private Ryan"" feeling but star wars. I also enjoyed K-2SO's sarcastic humor and Ben Mendelsohn played an amazing bad guy. Lastly the ending was so intense i couldn't move as Vader just slaughters rebel troops. Even though I knew the rebels eventually get the plans i still received goosebumps during the scene. The negatives to Rogue One mainly fall in the first hour of the movie. You are introduced to the new characters but it felt off putting switching to a new location every so often and having many useless scenes. It feels like the first hour of the film was a mixture of introduction and filler and the real movie starts when they get to Scariff. Another factor that falls on the negative is the CGI characters that are actually getting praise. The CG Tarkin looked OK until he stood by someone and it stuck out pretty bad. The Leah wasn't so bad but i would have really enjoyed the scene better if they didn't show her face at all. The final negative to this movie was the score. After viewing the film the first time none of the music in the film called out to me at all. In the force awakenings i felt the score was more star wars. But the score for Rogue one wasn't bad but most star wars movies have amazing scores. Rogue One is a good movie, not a great movie, not a bad movie. I enjoyed the last 45 minutes a lot but still fell to my expectations."
" A forgettable action film with flat characters.
",0.0,0.9881,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I liked Rogue One. I thought it was great. But there are many things in it that bothered me. The biggest flaw is the lack of character development: 1. The dynamic between Krennic and Galen was something I was looking forward to and I was hoping to see how their relationship falls apart. But we only get one flashback scene where they are buddy buddy to each other and then the rest of the movie they are enemies.2. Rogue One crew itself was barely developed. Jyn Erso has the most character development out of all of them but it isn't much. Her character lacks a charm and charisma that main characters in Star Wars usually have. We don't learn much about her as a character other than the circumstances she was put through. Her relationship with her father and how she feels about him is about as far as they go.3. Diego Luna and Felicity Jones should have had more chemistry. I was hoping to see a subtle developing love between them as the movie goes on much like Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back. But there was nothing. The death scene would have been so much more effective and heartbreaking had this been there.4. The rest of the crew suffer from the same problems. A little bit more character development could have gone a long way. I wanted to know more about them, especially Donnie Yen whose character did a great job bringing the presence of the force to this film. (The force was personified through his character much like it was through Obi-wan in A New Hope. I absolutely love it.)5. The pacing is a mess. The first half of the movie cuts from location to location way too fast. I wish the film could have stayed in one location for a bit longer. The second half of the films pacing starts to drag abit, making the pacing inconsistent. The fact that the film had extensive reshoots really shows.6. Yes this a ""war film"" and everything isn't black and white but I think they went too far with the Rebellion. A lot of the things they do is out of character. For example, the way they interrogate people and how quick they were to surrender.7. There's no title crawl. We known this before the movie came out but giving the nature of the films opening sequence and the events that happen before it, it would have been nice to have the title crawl. 8. The music score served this movie in some parts but overall it was forgettable. I understand Michael Giacchino only had 3 weeks to do the score (plus he had to come up with a balance of originality while also following the man himself-John Williams) and given his past work he has done on the Star Trek films ,if he was given more time, I don't doubt the score would have been much better. I was disappointed that there were very few queues to well known pieces of Star Wars music like Binary Sunset or the Imperial March.But even with these flaws Rogue One still had tons of impressive moments and some of the best imagery ever done in live action Star Wars. Director Gareth Edwards outdid himself with the visuals."
" May another farce be with you
",-0.4019,-0.9721,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"Okay, so Mrs. Shullivan insisted we go to the movies (since we were entering a New Year) and she had heard only great reviews from friends how fantastic this new chapter was in the Star War series. So we went all out and upgraded to the 3D film version with reclining theatre seats and waited for the film to start. Let me say that I did not mind the original 1977 film episode IV A New Hope, and even the subsequent two (2) films, episode V (1980) and episode V1 (1983) were passable theatre versions. But when the Star Wars film empire commenced with their Christmas mass merchandising effort and a continuous new epic (or spew yech) film every few years my own interest in the Star Wars series waned. Being the good sport that I am I agreed to get to the theatre early so we would not disturb anyone else and after sitting through 20 minutes of TV quality commercials, the movie started. The gist of the film is about a young five (5) year old Jyn Erso being instructed by her parents that she had to proceed in to her survival mode as the bad guys showed up to whisk daddy away so that he could complete building the ultimate laser weapon to destroy anything that the bad guys wanted to destroy. What followed over the next 15 years or so is the young five (5) year old Jyn learns to survive on her own and as a young female decides to find her father the scientist and save the world from weapons of mass destruction ....once again.If you like CGI and starships blasting each other out of the galaxy for the majority of the film then this chapter in the Star Wars saga will be right up your proverbial alley. As for me and Mrs. Shullivan we can sum it up in the following words: All hype and CGI and boring as hell. I give this chapter a 3 out of 10 rating and only for their marketing effort. I guess my personal review of Rogue One will illicit a lot of ""not agreed"" responses as the 184,601 reviewers have rated this film with a overly generous 8.1 rating. By the way....the 3D version did absolutely nothing to enhance my movie experience, save your money and see the non 3D version if you must."
" Boring movie
",-0.3182,-0.9298,2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Milk the cow while it lasts ?While some fighting sequences are familiar and a graphic feast. The story line and acting is very sub par. The movie was very boring and dreadful from the beginning, dragging on over the 2 hour mark. Were it the ""catering to the female hero""-crowd or the bad acting and poor script? I couldn't tell. Neither what warranted the length of the movie.Anyone who thinks this was a better as OK movie is probably bias and just so hooked on the brand they have no subjective opinion left. It was a total waste of time and money."
" disappointing yet enjoyable
",-0.0772,-0.8372,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The good: The movie looks great, a lot of work and money went into the CGI and it shows. It ties well into ep IV. The action scenes are fun (even though there are no lightsaber duels, not even lightsabers actually). The movie also shows the rebels in a more realistic ways, making some of their actions questionable at best.The bad: The characters were bland and boring. I didn't care about any of them. The closest I came to caring was for K2, a robot. This greatly affects the ending as it's losing all power it should have.The mediocre: While the music wasn't bad, no songs remained with me after seeing the movie, making it the first Star Wars movie to do so."
" A movie for fans, kids and to sell popcorn
",0.0,-0.7523,2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"I have to say I am getting tired of the Star Wars saga. Since ""Phantom menace"" I am starting to see how all the script are made using a cookie-cutter. And the female-hero thing is nice, but I think it is a little overdone by now. ""Rogue one"" is no exception to that rule: strong little girl loses her parents to the bad guys; grows alone, poor, and full of resentment, and in the end gets her revenge. Sounds familiar? We've being there like a trillion times. The only difference (which is a BIG difference) here is the end. Which I liked A LOT (finally something that really resemblance what really happens). The cast is great, but what really steals the show is the CGI characters. It is obvious we are still far from developing flesh-like CGI characters, but I have to admit the ones shown here are pretty promising. A movie for fans, kids and to sell popcorn."
" A reason there is WAR in Star WARs
",-0.8494,0.9985,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"The most important thing to note about Rogue One is that this is not a Star Wars episode, nor it should be. Rogue One is more than anything a war movie in a Star Wars universe.Knowing Gareth Edwards is directing it, one thing was certain: this movie will look damm good. Well that would be a massive understatement. Rogue One is a perfection in visual effects, cinematography, sound design, action directing, really technically this movie is gold standard and something that every other film period should aspire to match, despite this being a near impossibility. The only exception is one of the two motion capture characters, which is only in a shot for like 4 seconds and that's it. Gareth Edwards is to be praised for his work on this film. This is easily one of the best directed Star Wars and 2016 movies.This film does such a magnificent job at just not letting you feel sit comfortably as there is a war raging across the galaxy. It's unlike anything we have ever seen in other Star Wars movies. Our main protagonist Jyn Erso, which by the way was portrayed beautifully by Felicity Jones, is not some who am I, adventure hungry heroine like Anakin, Luke or Rey, nor are the rest of the characters of which we don't learn much, since they aren't meant to look as heroes but as normal people who got caught in this messy situation.Another praise-worthy aspect of this movie is that Rebellion is also forced into morally ambiguous actions in this desperate time. This is perfectly portrayed through a character of Cassian Andor played terrifically by Diego Luna. On the Empire side of things, Ben Mendelsohn did such an excellent job playing Director Krennic, you honestly feel for him.Speaking of characterization, the one issue I have with this film is that after the opening sequence the film does drag a bit for the rest of the first act, though it does have moments of brilliance in the mix. After that the movie is pretty much perfect. It also addresses and forever fixes a problem Star Wars fans had for decades and turned it into an in-joke in a very satisfying manor.The second act is great, but the third act... This is where you are in for some of the best action Star Wars has to offer. And once again it's not a cool lightsaber fight or anything like that, it's a dirty realistic war sequence, where the stakes are high, if they don't succeed it's game over. It's definitely on the closer to the R rating side of PG13.Oh, and yeah, Darth Vader isn't a whole lot in the movie, but towards the end he has the greatest Star Wars moment since, ""I am your father"". More memorable than anything in Return of the Jedi, prequels or The Force Awakens (which I loved).Everything about this movie is just so different, not just in comparison to Star Wars, but against the whole Hollywood norm. It sucks you in this dark and tense world where nothing is for granted, not even your life or peace and who would've thought that it's Disney to do it. The characters never asked to be heroes, their selfless actions and willingness to sacrifice everything made them that.Just before I sign off, I just have to say that the chemistry between Jyn and Cassian was executed flawlessly. They remind me a lot of Cage and Rita from Edge of Tomorrow. At first they view each other as a troublemakers, but through the course of the film they both realise of the greatness in each other and it all pays of in one of the most gut- wrenching finales there are.And without spoiling anything, the way the film ends is great, once again very much against the Hollywood norm, but just so fitting to the rest of the movie as well as to A New Hope, which you will never see in the same light as you did before. Rogue One gives gravity to the events in that movie. Just hang in there through the first act and let your mind be blown by the end. And after the credits roll just say to yourself ""this is a Disney movie"".""Rogue One, may The Force be with you."""

If so, I found it quite worthy of the Star Wars label.Exciting story line, typically well developed story lines and excellent battle scenes.The music, for the first time, is not by John Williams. Rather, Michael Giacchino takes over and does a fine job maintaining the feel of Williams' music and supporting the action.I had to click on the spoiler box because I did have one minor complaint - the beginning lacked the regular explanatory crawl."
" An absolute Triumph!!!
",0.6093,0.5596,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Rogue One - A Star Wars Story is an absolute triumph!! Putting the Wars in Star Wars I can safely say that it's an almost perfect example of what a sci-fi film should be, Well acted with jaw dropping visuals & a compelling story. It separates the true Star Wars fans from the casual viewer with a darker, adult orientated style in comparison to the more commercialised efforts of the Force Awakens. Edwards shows JJ Abrams how it's done, with just the right amount of fan service & nostalgia until we get the perfect mix in what can only be described as the only other Star Wars film to compete with the original trilogy!! 8/10 & my new second favourite Star wars film beaten only to the top spot by the Empire Strikes Back 😍😍 it comes to something when the only flaws I can find are that it doesn't have an opening crawl to start us off & the design of the intro logo looks like it was thrown together by a 5 year old 😂😂 That 3rd act & finale are something else....."
" Star Wars has hope.
",-0.1779,-0.9634,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Many people are under the impression that Star wars must have a certain feel and contain certain clichés. Particularly, if they don't feel like the original trilogy, these Star Wars products are inherently bad. The thing is, Star Wars has always been much more and its various stories in novels and games have not only understood that but often succeeded because of it. I must admit it was surprising that Disney and Lucasfilm gave the go ahead on a rather unique addition to Star Wars's cinematic universe. Rogue One is not like other Star Wars films. It is a war film and contains very little of the Jedi and Force elements of earlier films. It brings back the tragedy and dark elements of Revenge of the Sith and Empire Strikes back, perhaps even darker than ever.This is by no means a perfect film. Its characters, while sufficient and not two-dimensional, don't get the screen time they deserve. Even characters I loved like Donnie Yen's character could have used a few more minutes to go over their backstories. There are also some plot holes and poorly executed scenes, much like Gareth Edward's last film, Godzilla. What this film does right however is take chances and largely succeeds in its efforts. It is far more ambitious than any side-story cash grab has a right to be. This film isn't afraid to show the dark side of the Star Wars universe with multiple character deaths and violent massacres. The Empire feels dangerous in this film. The world building is also fantastic, the cinematography is spectacular, and this film has possibly the best space battles we've ever seen in Star Wars. If TFA (while not a bad film) made me wonder if Star Wars had become afraid to evolve, Rogue One has made me realize there is hope for this beloved franchise.Critically, I rate this film 8/10 and 9/10 for personal enjoyment."
" Awesome action. Bland characters.
",0.6249,0.7611,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm sorry. I like to write reviews without spoilers, but this time there is no way to work around it. So let's just jump ahead to the spoiler part, you'll find my opinion later on.The reason I spoil, has to do with the rewrites and re-shoots. It shows. It painfully shows. Due to them, character motivations made no sense and plot point either came out of nowhere or went nowhere or both. Most prominent examples (spoilers) are the mind reading tentacle beast that was supposed to drive this one pilot crazy, and the reasons for the Forrest Whitakker character to remain on the planet that partially exploded. He said he was tired of running. But no hint was given in the movie of him even running at all. He was - for as far as he was established - established as a fighter, not a runner. Him staying behind MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!Beyond the re-shoots, characterization is lacking throughout the entire movie. They are not properly built op, so they rise no viewers interest. Most of them are so unmemorable, you don't even get to remember their name. They hit plot points, but they have no character arcs. Well, the ninja zen guy was coming close to being a memorable character. But overall, K2S0, the robot, gets to have the most personality.The whole movie is plot driven, not character driven. It really really really hinges on being related to Star Wars. As a viewer, you get to care for the mission and the rebellion, but not really for the individual characters. Therefore, scenes that were supposed to be very emotional, such as the respective deaths of Forrest Whitakker and Mr Urso, lacked all impact whatsoever.Some of the nods to Star Wars were great, some were out of place. Most awful was the appearance of 'testicle chin guy' and 'you'll be dead guy' for no reason. Kind of like cramming Chewie and Boba Fett into the prequels, just making the universe smaller. Then, there was Darth Vader's agility in the final scene. Him doing all this lightsaber acrobatics in the final scene looked great - but made no sense. You don't see him this agile at any point in the original trilogy. Vader living on Mustaphar made no sense, but not in a way that was disturbing. Just... weird... Who would build his house at the site where you got your limbs chopped off by your friends?The incorporation of Mon Mothma and Senator Organa into this movie was done pretty good. Knowing these characters from previous movie provided the emotional anchor that the original new characters lacked. They didn't steal the show, though. They worked as side characters, and did their jobs correctly. Going back to Yavin4 was good. And the C-3PO and R2D2 cameo was done perfectly. It wasn't dragged out, and it made sense for them to be where they were. Perfect.Digital Tarkin and digital Leia were... okay I guess...And general not-Ackbar... was... there... Did he have to be a fish person? Either have the fish person be Ackbar, or have him be another race. Or, if you insist on having him a fish person, then at least make his character significantly different from Ackbar. What are you saying, Star Wars? All fish people are the same? That's racist!But, the final battle was pretty awesome. However, if you expect the scene from the trailer of the Jyn character facing a Tie-fighter, while only wielding a blaster... IT'S NOT THERE! I enjoyed seeing a Saving Private Ryan type of movie in the Star Wars universe, but it would have been so much better if it had actual characters.PS; what's the deal with the tentacle mind monster thing?"
" Could have been great
",0.6249,-0.9276,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"This had the potential to be a great star wars movie. It had it's own voice and story (unlike force awakens), and the story could slot into the original trilogy perfectly. The move makers nailed the star wars look, it had all the vehicles, all the robots, the aliens etc. It looked fantastic.And yet I couldn't help but look at my watch towards the end. It dragged through the middle and there was very little light to balance all the dark moments.#spoilers - every single main character dies! Every single one.. half of them were never really developed so you don't really care, but still. There's a few token 'rousing speeches'about hope and fighting against the odds for a cause, but there's nothing hopeful or joyful at all throughout the movie. I appreciate you need conflict in a story, you need danger to raise the stakes. But there's also a lot to be said for ""they all lived happily ever after"", or ""some of them lived happily ever after"" or even ""the ewoks had a BBQ at the end"". Basically, star wars to me has always been about escapist fun. Simple stories, good guys defeat the bad guys with cool aliens and robots sprinkled throughout. I don't need to see the agony of war or saving private Ryan sci-fi edition. It was just a bit too much for me. I didn't hate it, but I'm not in any hurry to see it again."

They want to just keep rolling in the dough, undeservedly, and keep this dead weight ,revised mockery of a once great franchise going. The characters are practically the same as the force awakens people:There's a girl, and shes kinda the star, or is she, whatever shes mildly cute so nerds will gawk at her shallow, vaguely hidden lack of emotion. Then there's a guy whom is not one of the vastly numerous space brits traipsing about, and a slight tension between him and whats her face. Oh and then there's a robot. A ROBOT! Does nobody else see this?Tell me if it was in one of the books before Disney ruined the tales, but I don't think much of this was. Oh and the guy playing darth vader was shorter than he should have been, plus an imperial trooper fell without classic lucas films ltd trade marked bad guy death wail.Blind Asian staff master * coughs * Elektra *coughs* constantly chanting I am one with the force, the force is with me, as if the brainwashing was not so blatantly obvious. "" Come back to us star wars geeks, you're our only hope of revenue"". Fore SHADOWIING! lol says the studio pumping out these funny films. Its just so cheesy, and no macaroni. And it all began with Forest whitaker's metal plated afro wearing self. That took balls. DONE. Cant forgive it, the franchise is still garbage. R.I.P. final victim of 2016: The star wars franchise."

(I'm not saying it's a disaster like ""suicide squad"". I enjoyed it.)I loved third act. but first act was kind of boring. and second too. My problem is the characters and their emotions. this is directed by that guy who did ""Godzilla(2014)"", and as I remember that movie was nothing like ""The Sciendler's List"". Jyn and Cassian are not as memorable(nor charming) as Luke, han, rey, finn, Leia. though actors try their best. This girl Jyn. she goes from ""hey I mind my own business"" to Che Guevarra in whip of a wind. it feels like dull world war 2 propaganda. they want to give a message about how important-and hard-it is to fight evil. I get it. barley. this is no ""Saving Private Ryan"". it's just that I didn't really feel that desperate. I did at the last scene. it was more tearjerking when the nameless rebel soldiers got slashed by Darth vader then, you know. when all of our main characters died. I just didn't get attached to them. besides that I liked it. new look for things we've already seen. watching AT-ATs from down below was gave me goosebumps. watching vader from eyes of non-jedi did that too. not to mention we finally got to talk back to nitpicking bastards saying ""Death star goes boom with just 2 torpedoes! what a dumb movie!"" also that poetic scenes we loved in godzilla. krennic watching death star pointed at him was genius. that guy has goods and bads."
" A very different, but very welcome, take on the Star Wars universe
",-0.1181,0.9571,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"What I liked most is that Rogue One puts in the foreground the toll the Empire takes on the lives of the people who live under it, or struggle against it. Jyn Erso, the lead -- charismatically portrayed by Felicity Jones -- is one of these people: living on the run from the Empire since childhood, raised a rebel cadre before the cause abandoned her and she abandoned it, the story is essentially the tale of her coming to terms with her past and trying to fulfil her work, to make sure her father's last gesture against the Empire doesn't come to nothing. The people gathered around her are the flotsam and jetsam of rebellion and resistance, people who've traded parts of themselves (in some cases literally) to the pay the price of battling the Emperor; some of them have retained a sense of at least gallows humour about all this (Donnie Yen's Chirrut is one of the most instantly memorable characters ever to appear in a Star Wars movie because of this), others have been largely broken by it (brought out beautifully in Forest Whitaker's portrayal of the paranoid and hollowed-out Saw Gerrera), or remain driven by the need to have the terrible things they've done in the name of the rebellion mean something (which provides a passable excuse for the relatively stock Stoic Hero character Cassian). Everyone is damaged in some degree and looking for some kind of redemption, some way of striking back.These people, and the tone of the story they inhabit, are considerably different from -- and darker than -- anything we've seen in Star Wars before. I think this lies at the root of the otherwise baffling claims in some quarters that the film lacked ""interesting"" story, characters or emotion; if you come in expecting the light-hearted, bantering space opera adventure tone of something like A New Hope or The Force Awakens, that's decidedly not what this is. I'm okay with that, because Rogue One is ditching (most of) the light-heartedness in favour of what is essentially a species of relatively grown-up ""war movie"" style storytelling in Star Wars clothing. it gains more from the trade-off than it loses. That's not to say everything is perfect. I'm not entirely convinced by the way the hero team coheres by the end of the film, and Cassian in particular does not really hold his own as an interesting protagonist across from Jones' excellent work as Jyn Urso. There are nitpicks to be had with the way the action is handled from time to time (Rogue One really does bring up the eternal questions of why exactly stormtroopers wear armor that apparently is useless), and sequences that don't quite make sense (Saw Gerrera's tentacle moster). But there's so much more tastiness here: Mikkelsen, Whitaker, Yen, Alan Tudyk's priceless turn as the cynical droid K2SO, a fun and smarmy baddie in Krennic, a badass guest appearance by Darth Vader, the digital wizardry used to resurrect Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin and to give us a glimpse of a young Leia. Sauced with excellent action sequences and clever fan-friendly nods and easter eggs, I found Rogue One to be tremendous fun on the whole."
