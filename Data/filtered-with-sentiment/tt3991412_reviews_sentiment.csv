" Love this twisted movie!
",0.6696,0.8472,2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I've seen this a few times now and watch it anytime it comes on. Aside from the obvious talented and beautiful Sarah Gadon, the other major actors give this film exactly what it needs... other than a terribly long buildup. The wait is worth it if your brain doesn't get frustrated enough, it's worth the wait at the end of the film. Dark, twisted, and drama-filled."
" An emotional ride well worth watching
",0.5574,0.9217,2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"One word: good. Everything about this movie is good. Exceptional cast, with Sarah Gadon arguably at her best. Freaky also. It is a well developed story with a satisfying end. I may even have dropped some tears during the proceedings. Well done. (Production value: 10/10)"
" Like a cheesy 1990s movie
",0.3612,0.6908,2020-02-26 00:00:00,4,"It's literally like watching a movie from the 90's now. It just feels outdated, unrealistic and cheesy. Save your time and watch something else."
" Dreadful
",-0.4404,-0.9477,2020-02-05 00:00:00,2,"Told as if it were some type of fable, instead of the heaping pile of dreck it actually is, this movie took stupidity to a whole other level. I guessed the twist way too early and then just waited for it to unfold. With annoying characters , this movie was an insult to fathers, mothers, doctors, cops and therapists. Throw in all sorts of nonsense like sleepwalking and creatures, stir in bad acting and an annoying child actor and this is a must to avoid."

SPOILERS
i wish i didn't figure out most of the ending early in the movie. it would have been a great reveal if i was not expecting it. but i don't think it happened due to overthinking. they kept telling us that the dad was bad and the mom was caring, but everything they showed with the dad was him being a loving father, and they showed a few scenes of the mom being crazy. so immediately wondered if she was really the crazy one. i also was able to guess that he left his wife for her and now it was happening to the doctor too. i'm pretty sure i even wondered about Munchhausen syndrome. but the way the entire ending was put together was still great. i was completely surprised that she killed him that same day and how that incident took place. and the extent of the Munchhausen syndrome, and by proxy"
" Underrated Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9822,2019-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure where all of the negative reviews come from. They're certainly not deserved. It doesn't take a genius to understand that the ""accidents"" are not at all accidental by the 2nd/3rd one. Now that the obvious has been stated; we can move on to the cause of them, which is also obvious, since the only constant character with the ability to manufacture them is mom. What does that indicate; mental illness or Munchousen's syndrome by proxy, for a more specific cause. Next, mental illness tends to run in families, and Louis has a touch of his own, just not in the form of his mother's.Is his genius manipulation of the Doctor, and basically everyone around him, besides her an accident? I don't think so. He states something along the lines of learning how to survive amidst all these accidents. He knew she was hurting him, but what could he do? She obviously loved him, he knew this and loved her deeply in return, therefore couldn't betray the secrets that she didn't even know he held. He loved his father too, although knew his father wasn't his biological, but I can't remember how he knew, however he loved the man as much or maybe more than the mother because he wasn't trying to hurt him. The accidental death of the father wasn't intentional, she had more grief over this than the boy falling because in her diseased mind, he would always be safe. In this case, he was ""safe"" because his father broke his fall.Now, onto the fantasy elements. The boy was in a coma, or was he? Did he need to go to such lengths as pretending to still be comatose when he in fact was not? Technically, yes. Yes he did. He had to create a fantasy world for the Doctor before he fell into her trap (which ended up being a little too late) by pretending to be his father with the note to the doctor. There's nothing technically supernatural, unless the child has been clairvoyant his whole life and able to read what people are thinking or predict what's coming. There are some elements that suggest this, as Louis talks about adapting to survive. But if so, why wasn't he able to know when his mother was going to hurt him? Didn't he allude to that by saying she needed help, she was fragile? He sacrificed his own well-being, to allow his mother to gain the attention she desperately craved. It went too far, however, when his father died trying to protect him.What I'm saying is that, either Louis had some sort of telepathy and was able to conjure the images for the Doctor in order to make him question what he believed, or the letters ""written"" to the Doctor while Louis was supposedly in a coma made the doctor question things more deeply and then his dreaming mind submit its own hypothesis.Who knows? What I can say, is that I have yet to see ANYONE dig very deeply into this, or any other movie that doesn't hold your hand and give your everything, with no meat to chew on long after the movie. The really good movies and the ones that don't end when the credits do and only when your mind stops mulling over the possibilities, rarely get good reviews. This bugs me on a personal level because I'm a thinker and to read horrible reviews after watching a masterpiece that really went deep into the human psyche, just feels like I'm one of very few interested in the actual story the writer is trying to tell. The allegory, the symbolism. For instance, The Ward was a very interesting movie, again telling the story of a really serious mental illness, through horror movie type visualizations. Stonehurst Asylum is one of my most favorites, as it's telling a modern version (loosely, of course) of an under appreciated Poe story called ""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether"". Mental illness is a serious business, and we pay closer attention when it's laid in front of us. ""Business"" meaning that's exactly what it is now and has always been, at least at the hands of those that go on to become doctors. There are unique individuals who've been put away only because they choose to stay to themselves and mind their business, and don't much care for the outgoing lifestyle. Those people are now deemed ""introverted"", and harmless, but how many were electroshocked into droolsville because their doctors were paid to ""cure"" them of a non-existence disease, that happened to be just their personalities. I wonder if the young Kenennedy girl, victimized by a lobotomy, had a voice back then; would she have used it?"
" Very good
",0.4927,0.4404,2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,That was one of the best psychological movie I watched nowadays. You will be shocked at the end of the film..
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.6114,2018-10-28 00:00:00,8,"It starts as a TV movie that reveals itself straightforwardly until it veers off into uncharted territory. I had given up on the film but when the story veered, I stopped and rewinded 10 minutes to catch the drift. I found the film excellent and the beginning is just lulling the viewer before getting into high gears. Bravo!"
" It's an interesting twist
",0.4019,0.7465,2018-10-14 00:00:00,9,I liked the movie very much and I think the low rating is unjustified. The story was gripping but maybe its more for arthouse lovers instead of mainstream movie goers.
" Figuring out the ""twist"" early, actually helps
",0.3818,0.7435,2018-08-08 00:00:00,8,"I had a strong suspicion as to the underlying family dynamics from the beginning which made the entire mythology much more understandable. When viewed through that lens any ""unevenness in tone"" makes perfect sense. I don't want to give anything away--but see if you don't say ""aha!"" once you've guessed the secret. If you don't figure it out before the end--and really all of the clues are there but if you aren't familiar with psychological disorderrs don't feel bad if you miss it, think back (or watch it over again) and see if it doesn't make a difference."

",0.0,0.2238,2018-06-15 00:00:00,6,"A little slow to start but stick with it, it is worth it in the end. The story line is also a bit weird to start with and it leaves you wondering where the story is going. This thriller twists and turns and hints at something dark and disturbing. Overall a good movie slow to start. Would we watch it again, absolutely, retained for future viewing."
" Underrated!
",0.0,0.8826,2018-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I usually don't review movies but I saw the 'meh'-rating of what I found to be a visually stunning trip and thought-provoking theme so I felt I had to put my two cents!Granted it is not for everybody, I can see how the combination of a metaphysical aspect with a mystery, thriller drama can appear too senseless for some but give it a try with an open-mind!I personally found it very gripping and satisfying to watch- apparently very memorable since I still think about it 2 years after watching! 8.5/10"
" Why?
",0.0,-0.6908,2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,What the heck was this movie really about? Paul and Parker were wasted in this mess.
" Atmospheric and dreamy with beautiful soundtrack
",0.5994,0.9908,2018-02-05 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised this movie doesn't have a higher rating. While I didn't like the makeup and voice of the monster and thought the movie might have been better without it, I liked the mix of fantasy and reality. I saw the plot twist coming a bit early, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment. The narration from the kid's perspective was fine. I always love it when a story doesn't assume a child is stupid and adults are know-it-alls. I definitely felt empathy for the kid.What I liked the most was the soundtrack, which really carries the movie. I'm a huge Patrick Watson fan and I hope he'll get the opportunity to make many more soundtracks.I had some flashbacks to The Sixth Sense (which admittedly is a better movie overall). It also had a dreamy, melancholic, atmospheric quality to it and I think lovers of M. Night Shyamalan-style mystery will definitely enjoy this movie too."
" Failed to Deliver on Promising Potential
",-0.1531,0.8631,2018-01-05 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)I really wanted to like this in part from the attractive DVD cover and quirky movie title. It was a good attempt with an intriguing core plot around mind melding, subconscious and dreams yet sadly misses the mark to be exceptional. Louis Drax is a young boy who has been very fortunate to still be alive as he is like a cat, as the title implies, and has had many lives and due to foolish or unfortunate life occurrences could easily be dead. The surreal portions of the film's theme could have been executed more convincingly. And it was not visually captivating nor imaginative enough. Its pacing and scene development felt very tedious and by the time interesting things began to occur my interest level had fallen so far that all impact was lost. It was also rather more depressing than it needed to be. Overall, it was a missed opportunity."
" An incredible source for a tragic course of events
",-0.4588,0.255,2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"A young boy, apparently prone to accidents, nearly escaped death eight times across his short life. While on a picnic with his separated parents, he's involved in another accident, in which he falls from a very high cliff, directly into the cold water. He manages to survive but enters a deep coma from which he doesn't seem willing to recover, while his suffering mother must deal with his situation but also with the disappearance of his father, who's accused of attempting to kill him.It's a movie which introduces a deep mystery and throughout its length, it does what it can to lead the viewer to various leads, thus making almost everyone a suspect. It slowly describes the troubled life of young Louis, introducing new information which is intended to increase suspense and make the picture more and more interesting. Its actors do a very good job in creating this dramatic atmosphere which ends with a highly unexpected conclusion.Although breath-taking in essence with most of its scenes, its way of inserting stories into stories and moving from present to the past and the other way around makes you unable to miss the somehow erratic and unexplainable actions the main characters undergo in many tense situations, which somehow affect the course of events. Also, although unexpected and mind boggling, the finale is not very satisfying, as it could have done a bit more to end this dramatic movie.Overall, it's a very good movie of its kind which manages to unfold a deep and troubling mystery in a very interesting way, but misses the chance of being truly great due to some details which could have been easily avoided."
" mainly a waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.4269,2017-09-26 00:00:00,3,"I guessed the cause of young Louis' sad predicament some five or ten minutes into the movie, which isn't all one could wish for in a whodunit. It's entirely possible that other viewers may have guessed this even earlier, given the fact that the clues and hints are so painfully obvious. This does not only lessen the viewer's pleasure, it also undermines the internal logic and credibility of the plot : if a normal member of homo sapiens can grasp the truth with a minimum of effort, why are the various characters so dumb ? It's pretty much like making a movie in which, say, all the guests and news anchors of CNN start waving a black and white ISIS flag while threatening the infidel dogs of the dying West - and nobody notices anything untoward.The segment involving hypnosis feels forced and unnatural. It is used mainly as a easy way in which to dump a ton of exposition and resolution on the viewer. (By the way : is there even a snowball's chance in hell of testimony given under hypnosis, BY AN INTERMEDIARY, being accepted as evidence ?) Also deeply annoying : the omnipresent voice of Louis himself. No child speaks like this : it's the kind of preternaturally intelligent and ironic voice which, like Marilyn Monroe's platinum hair color, does not exist in real life.There are a few redeeming features here and there, such as some nice performances and some visually imaginative excursions into fantasy, but as a whole the movie doesn't work."
" Where was this set?
",0.0,0.6378,2017-09-16 00:00:00,2,"I think most of the other reviewers have picked apart the movie quite thoroughly - highlighting the numerous areas that were perplexing choices on behalf of the director.So, I just have one thing to add. This film is set in San Francisco with some brief shots in San Diego (Seaworld). Why? None of the characters had a San Francisco mindset - that was what took me completely out of the movie, rather than the fantasy elements (which I had no problem with). At best I could classify their mindset as small town New England, but that also doesn't seem fair. If you are interested in a movie that does a good job of portraying the type of people who live in the Bay Area, I recommend Coherence.The San Diego scene was all wrong too - nobody wears jackets and hoodies when they go to Seaworld."
" An excellent plot and great suspense
",0.8316,0.9869,2017-08-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie draws you along, and doesn't leave you in your own head trying to figure out what happens next, till near the end. And even then, you are riveted. The ending had a small twist, that was well done, but seemed a little too preachy at the end. I guess some filmmakers and/or story writers feel the need to supply morals in a world that has no basis for them anymore. Nonetheless, the plot devices and its non-linear storytelling blend well together, and make for a big win in my book. The performances were all lights out fantastic from a cast of relative unknowns. This gives you hope for the future of cinema, and dramatic acting in general. Especially in this era of the super hero film. It also seamlessly blends science and medical technology with the paranormal, in a way I haven't seen since ""The sixth Sense"". More than any other film I have reviewed here (and there have been a few that I have felt unjustly rated) this film's overall low rating is grossly unfair. It blends all the tools of good storytelling and suspense, with great revelations at its climax and ending. Not to mention dialog that leads you where it wants you to go I highly recommend it."
" Interesting movie to watch
",0.4019,0.792,2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,Nominated worst movie of the year?. I wonder what was watching these guys I really don't understand critic experts. Since Shakespeare in love won i quit of listen to them. This is a great movie. It starts as a comedy then turns to drama then to fiction and ends with mystery and investigation. So you have a good movie with lots of éléments. Maybe is not the best but it doesn't disappoint. Worth to see more than many others.
" A snail would beat it for pace
",0.0,0.968,2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"I'm glad I only watched it on Netflix, it's soooo slow I gave up. All I got out of it was a jerk of a kid who's accident prone. I don't mind psychological thrillers, quite like them actually but there needs to be something of interest to hold onto my interest and this didn't have it. I persevered for about a half hour or what seemed like a lifetime before giving up. The hook that there 'might' be something of interest at the end is not enough for me to invest and hour and a half of my time or however long this film was. No thanks, time to move on."
" Ghost in the movie The 9th Life of Louis Drax
",-0.3182,-0.3382,2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"This is something that already happened in movies like Three Men And A Baby. A ghost suddenly appears during some scene. I think the same is happening on this movie. If you are watching on Netflix, at the time 00:20:32, is possible to see a ghost walking near the trees, in the background. If you are not watching on Netflix, this happen when the doctor says: ""We just need to find a way through to him""Very creepy!"
" The curious deathtraps of Louis Drax.
",0.3182,0.9769,2017-06-24 00:00:00,6,"This is not what the director is famous for. But still the suspense keeps us hoping for the turnaround at any time. The film was based on the book of the same name. With a decent cast and production, the film somewhat achieved its goal. The screenplay was not that bad, but the contents lacked. Even though it is a mystery theme, you would predict a few things. Not everybody does that, but I did, I figured it out the puzzle at a certain stage of the narration, before it disclosed at the crucial part.It's about a boy in the title name. He has survived many times from the death since he was in foetus. But it seems for the 9th time he was out of the luck. It was not yet game over for him, because he's now in the coma fighting between the life and death. Meanwhile, his recent past was revealed and her mother starts to get close to the doctor who treating him. From all, the biggest suspense is what made him to end in this condition and when the film reaches the final stage, everything comes out with a twist.It's certainly a watchable film, but the quality of preserving the secret was not up to the par what a normal viewer expects from this kind of storyline. The suitable atmosphere was created, and so the characters. With a decent runtime and its pace, pretty much an okay film, but somewhat, something is not quite well in it. From the direction to the actors, they all very dedicated for to their parts. Thematically, I loved it, yet it should have been more eventful, I mean more story and more developments. Overall, not a must see film, but once.6/10"
" Tell a Story about reality

The main plot is simple, it's about Love — nothing more. Then it cuts down to a few minor plots that leads to the main plot in the movie, every moment wasn't there just to fill a movie script, it meant something for the whole movie even the small details.I loved this movie, and I give it a 9/10"
" The Power of the Mind
",0.0,0.9949,2017-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Louis Drax (Aiden Longworth) is a special nine year old. As he narrates his tale he's suffered numerous accidents in the few short years he's been on this planet. So much so that his mother tells him he's catlike and needs to be careful because he's nearing his ninth life. So when he plunges over a cliff early on in the film the odds of his surviving are slim. But survive he does.Rushed to the hospital with his mother in tow and his father missing, Louis was underwater for some time after falling off the cliff into the sea. The combination of cold and lack of oxygen leaves him clinging for life. Eventually the doctors' call his death official and he is carted off to the morguewhere he wakes much to the consternation of the morgue attendant. Rushed back to surgery Louis is barely alive and in a coma.Enter into the picture Dr. Allan Pascal (Jamie Dornan), a neurosurgeon who is fortunately nearby. He comes into the case trying to help Louis come out of his coma and to communicate. Placed in the wing he oversees filled with various coma patients Pascal and his staff talk to them, interact with them and try to ease them back.Louis' mother Natalie (Sarah Gadon) refuses to leave the hospital until she can be with Louis. His father Peter (Aaron Paul) is still missing and considered on the run. Natalie has told the police that he pushed Louis off of the edge of the cliff.The movie moves back and forth in time and space as we listen to Louis tell us about his life. Most of this is done in flashback as Louis talks to his therapist Dr. Perez (Oliver Platt). Bits and pieces of what was happening in his day to day world combined with his attitude towards life are revealed in these moments, peeled back like the layers of an onion but never quite telling us the whole story.In addition to the tale of Louis that he is presenting us we have that of Dr. Pascal and Louis' mother Natalie. The married Pascal finds himself attracted to the young mother in need. This doesn't go unnoticed by the staff or by the police, still on the hunt for Peter Drax. Their story unfolds slowly as well offering us more of a question mark as to their potential future rather than a solid yes or no.Eventually Pascal begins to suspect that Louis has been trying to use his brainwaves to communicate to him via his dreams. This leads to a hypnotic session involving Pascal and Perez that they hope will lead to the truth about what happened to young Louis and if he is indeed trying to communicate with them.I know, this all sounds a bit weird. The fact is that it is weird but in a good way. While not identical I found myself thinking back to the movie DONNIE DARKO with the strange way the story is told but how it all makes sense in the end. That a movie can achieve this AND tell a solid story at the same time makes for one marvelous movie.The movie itself looks fantastic but I would expect nothing less from director Alexandre Aja. I've long been a fan of his including past films like HORNS, MIRRORS and PIRANHA 3D. He has a great visual sense and a respect for fantasy I've only seen in director Guillermo del Toro. He puts that to great use here in this film.The entire cast does a tremendous job here. Dornan plays Pascal low key which is what we need from the character. Gadon is the endangered waif of a woman that needs protected. But for me the standout was Aaron Paul. Having seen him for several years in BREAKING BAD it's nice to see him portray a character who may be nefarious but at the same time might be purely innocent.On the whole I can't recommend this film enough. I was captured by the story from start to finish, never wanting to check the time stamp to see how much longer I had to sit through the movie. It's one that I know will take a space on my shelf of movies to revisit on occasion. It's also one I'm looking forward to discussing with others who get the chance to see it. It is a movie worth seeking out if not owning it outright."

" Quirky little thriller
",0.0276,0.7783,2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,"""The 9th Life of Louis Drax"" is not the kind of movie that will attract the mainstream audiences. Black comedy, mystery, fairy tale and paranormal thriller all in one, shot in a soft, dreamy, liquid style by Alexandre Aja (despite his ""extreme"" reputation, this could easily get by with a PG-13 rating), well-acted by the entire cast, this is a likably idiosyncratic little film, even though the main plot twist is generally predictable. **1/2 out of 4."

",0.0,0.9573,2017-05-12 00:00:00,8,"I made the mistake of reading some reviews and almost didn't watch it because of the negativity shown towards the movie. Certainly, the key themes are adult in nature and lend a darkness that seems at odds with the perspective of a child's narrative, but that helped keep some of the mystery, even though it appeared to give some reviewers a reason to dislike the movie. Early in the movie I'd a pretty good idea how the story would play out and yet the way in which it did was not predictable and kept my interest. I even liked how the ""pirates of the Caribbean / a monster calls"" style was utilised in manifesting some of the plot. To summarise this was certainly worth a watch and not as bad as some of its haters would lead you to believe."

His mother Natalie (Sarah Gordon) says the father Peter Drax (Aaron Paul) pushed Louis over the cliff. The police and doctors are searching for the truth about what happened and Peter Drax is missing and is a suspect.We come to learn via flashbacks and his narration that Louis Drax is a very injury prone child. Doctor Perez (Oliver Platt) believes the boy is harming himself looking for attention. Then the letters arrive seemingly written by Louis Drax, but how can that be when he is in a coma? The letters tell about things that only Louis Drax knows and the mystery deepens. Dr Pascal (Jamie Dornan) believes something else is going on with Louis Drax. It appears that maybe, just maybe, something supernatural is going on. Now you are getting warm, but how to prove it? There are a couple twists and some may say ""convoluted"" but nevertheless they are there and come to light. Can you guess?Notables: A Sea Monster and a friend to Louis is the voice of Aaron Paul; Barbara Hershey as Violet Drax, Peter's mother.All in all a very good mystery - convoluted or not - and the acting by all sells it. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes, but brief.. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, but very brief"

",-0.4939,0.992,2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyable mystery thriller that won't keep you on the edge of your seat but that is still interesting to watch. I do like mysteries, it's one of my favorite genre of movies, and in The 9th Life Of Louis Drax I figured it all out at half of the movie. And other people will probably do as well. That could be a sign that it's not interesting to watch because the story is too obvious. But it isn't at all. Even though I was practically certain what the outcome would be it remains a movie with a high likability to watch. The narrating voice of Aiden Longworth is pleasant to hear, even though I read that other reviewers didn't like it. The kid's character would probably not be the cutest boy to live with but in the movie it works perfectly. The rest of the cast are all a great addition to the movie. No bad words about anybody in this movie. It's beautifully shot, mesmerizing with the narrating voice, the twist is like I said a bit too obvious but it's still working. You have good movies that you will watch once, but this one is just above that and is one I would watch again in the future."

The Film's Highlight is the Visual Template that is anything but Normal and the Movie is Mounted with a Compelling Composite of an Other Worldly Template.The Cast is Game in Difficult Roles with Aiden Longworth as Louis Drax (doing double duty narration) shows the Charm of a Mischievous Pixie, Aaron Paul (Dad), Sarah Gadon (Mom), and Jamie Dornan as the Doctor who takes Care of Louis in the Coma Ward.The Story and Script Flows Unevenly around the Events that Struggle to Combine Fantasy, Domestic Situations, Horror, Infidelity, Ethics, Suspense, Mystery, and the Kitchen Sink (where dangers lurk).Overall, Worth a Watch but be Prepared for some very Strange Situations and Nonsense that is Not Very Satisfying and the Twist can Raise more than just an Eyebrow."

His beautiful mother appears to dote on him and then one day he has a near fatal fall from a cliff top – I mean if he is such a klutz why take him to a cliff edge – c'mon.Anyway silly parental gaffs aside he is then taken under the wing of hunky, coma paediatrician expert, Dr Alan Pascal (Jamie Dornan) who thinks that it may be possible links that can be maintained through means yet to be understood by medical science. Thus begins a surreal, often warm and often twisted trip into the previous eight lives of the titular Louis Drax.Now I actually quite enjoyed this it is adapted from the book – but I shall not compare the two. The cast are all above good and the special effects are both great and believable. It is a slow reveal and is the sort of film that you may only wish to see once (so go for a rental) but it is worth going for al the same."
" Louis Drax makes for a thoroughly interesting narrator indeed.
",0.4576,0.9721,2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"The 9th Life of Louis Drax is a powerful movie that brought me flashes of Room because we have such a strong child main character and reminiscent of Patrick Ness' A Monster Calls at times. It is so beautiful in a subtle dark way that you don't really fully grasp until the end.I struggled a bit with the pace because even Louis' voice got tiresome every now and then, but the dreamy atmosphere saturated with a constant sense of suspense and mystery where you just had to know more about this kid and what happened to him kept me hooked.Louis is such a smart, perceptive, special kid, with his own voice and sense of self. You can't help but let him grow on you.There were some things I did not appreciate, such as the insta-love, but in the end even that made sense, and the twist caught me off guard, although I chided myself for not having thought of it, but the movie is that well done. Looking back you see it makes perfect sense but while watching it just doesn't come to mind.The 9th Life of Louis Drax is most definitely a unique movie that I highly recommend."
" Simpering sick-making kid survives his suicide attempt
",-0.6705,-0.6366,2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"Appalling drivel. Perhaps it should be called 'The Near Death of Jamie Dornan' or 'The Attempted Suicide of Aaron Paul.' 'The Observer' described it as 'a mystery worth solving': the only mystery is how much money Mr Paul was paid for appearing as a cross between 'Swamp Thing' and 'The Elephant Man.' As for being a thriller, it was about as thrilling as three hours of the Welsh Assembly discussing Brexit. It starts like a comedy for not very intelligent 10-year-olds, and then settles in as Mills & Boon with sleepy background music."
" I couldn't get through it....
",0.0,-0.3431,2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I knew after five minutes that this was a dark dramedy and not a thriller. I also found the child's high-pitched voice annoying. I was hoping this would be something along the lines of Unbreakable, but I was not even able to get through it. The boy's first few ""lives"" are unraveled in an almost comedic way, in the first five minutes. Enter the doctor who gives lectures and has a best-selling book. At this point, I was losing interest. I don't know how this ended, nor do I care. The sound editing was the worst, too - make sure you have all background noise turned off. This had some good reviews, so I was very disappointed. To each his own. Maybe you will like it."
" The mystery suspense, fantasy, and crime drama all in one that seems uneven and boring.
",-0.7003,-0.9917,2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"The 9th Life of Louis Drax kind of caught me off guard on what the film was about or what kind of direction and tone it was trying to aim for. Understanding it is based on a book about Louis Drax (Aiden Longworth) on his 9th birthday at a family picnic. He accidentally falls off a cliff, hitting the shore in a near death experience that puts him in a coma. Dr. Allan (Jamie Dornan) tries to care for his patient, only trying to understand the accident about the boy's mother Natalie (Sarah Gadon) and her husband Peter (Aaron Paul) who went missing after the accident. The plot is best not knowing and not giving out any details or spoilers. I liked the idea that it was following on a boy's perspective. Yet, not every pieces of detail is revealed. But slowly pieced together, especially Louis is one estranged kid, who is prone to accidents every year of his life and survived them. Is it all a coincidence that Louis accidents were connected? But the disappointing thing about the direction on the plot, even once the twists are revealed. It was not once satisfying, once the plots mystery pieces are put together in the final act. Talking about the tone of the film, which was quite all over the place. The film starts out like a fantasy film about a boy's journey through his life and how he was prone to accidents even from the stupid choices of sticking a fork in an electrical outlet. But after Louis falls and goes into a coma, the tone switches to a crime drama with the investigation if it was domestic abuse on his parents struggle with their marriage. Then, a bit of a supernatural thriller with Louis in a coma following some mysterious figure that has been speaking to him about his experiences. Director Alexandre Aja was all over the place with his direction, which makes it look like he wanted to do a fantasy tone in a dark crime drama that turns out to be uneven. The beginning of the movie seeing Louis in all his accidents looked kind of cheesy. The cast all felt a little flat with their characters. Jamie Dornan, Sarah Gadon, Aaron Paul, and Aiden Longworth all gave dull performances. Now, slightly being disappointed for Alexandre Aja's direction, which his films have been going downhill. From making an intense horror film The Hill Have Eyes remake to a fun campy Piranha movie. His weaknesses seem to be the supernatural films like his last two and this. The film could have used a better balance on tone and direction. Instead, it was delivering mixed signals that it was trying to be a self-discovery fantasy film. The music score also stuck out in a mystery story that did not work. The 9th Life of Louis Drax seems like a more straight to TV supernatural drama film that's best caught on there, than paying for a rental. Otherwise, it was a boring film that had trouble with its mixed tone, dull acting, and poor direction."
" Wow!!
",0.658,0.9692,2017-02-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie needs more credit just for the sheer unexpected nature of the storyline.I must say, I started with a blank sheet. Did not read any reviews, spoilers or anything that would have ruined the fun for me. Had just watched a clip, and it seemed okay enough to continue with the ~2 hour ride. Must say, did not regret a bit.For the first 5-10 minutes, I took it for a (childrens') comedy. For the following as many minutes, I was wondering if it was afterall a spiritual movie to the core. Then I had settled for plain family drama; well, that is, until I arrived at the last 15-10 minutes.Not that it is an absolute masterpiece in every aspect of film making, but sure, really really sure, it's worth the time. That's probably all one could give up without giving up the storyline.I totally recommend the fun experience."
" Supernatural Film with a Unique Storyline

The plot is intriguing and mysterious but the conclusion could be better and better since the twist discloses Natalie's personality too soon with the visit of Peter 's mother to the hospital. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Nona Vida de Louis Drax"" (""The 9th Life of Louis Drax"")"
" Like being hit by a bus on a Beautiful spring day.I never saw it coming .
",0.7506,0.343,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Not many will understand this soft murder Mystery at first.The cinematic Beauty of nature coupled with alternative classical music is misdirection at it's best.When watching a film with overtones of narration it gives one the feeling of reading a novel.More of a slow paced an intellectual film. I thought It was worth a watch, more of a female movie. Such a rare disorder, But this film had a pollyanna attitude it did not smack so hard.By submitting this review you are agreeing to the terms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

" ""Being in a coma doesn't suck"" (dialog, Louis)
",0.3412,0.6211,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie has a lot in common with those crazy weekends where you go off to a remote location with a group, under the supervision of a sort of modern drill sergeant, and then see if you can survive the dangers of the wild. If you do, then Monday morning you are a better person for it. At least in theory.So it is when you enter the theatre to watch this film. No matter what your preferred ""film pallet"" may be, this work will test it to the max.The story is .... odd. The opening, which has a cutesy first person narrative of the kind you expect to find in films like THE LITTLE PRINCE is ... odd. The narrative exposition, which uses a sort of undefined, almost magical, interface is ... odd.In fact the whole film, which starts as a heart-warming tale and ends in a cross between Hitchcock and pure horror is ... odd.I checked out the film because it is one of the few works from Alexandre Aja, a director considered a genius by his many fans and a time-waster by his many detractors. This film is not going to please either group.This odd story of an accident-prone boy also violates many of the rules of conventional film-making and seems to go out of its way to make the viewer uncomfortable and even downright squirmy.After all that ""endurance testing"" you would expect a big payoff, but all you get is a small one. A very small one.And when it comes to payoffs, size does matter.The brightest spots in the movie are Aaron Paul, an actor whom -- as I commented in an earlier review for the IMDb -- is becoming the closest thing modern audiences have to a Jimmy Stewart. Essentially the only person in a movie you immediately want to trust.And the always reliable Molly Parker (Deadwood) who, like Paul, gives a viewer a place to ""go to ground"" during the ordeal that this film has become."
