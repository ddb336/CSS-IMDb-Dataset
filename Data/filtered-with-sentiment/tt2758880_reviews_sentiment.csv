When the movie was in the end it looked like it was in the beginning and there it goes 3 hours.

" Meditative drama
",0.34,-0.2023,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"This film's drama is slow and meditative - a far cry from the soap operas that it constantly belittles. It centres on a remote Turkish village and the wealthy but reclusive patriarch who starts off with an outwardly principled appearance but turns out to be judgemental and destructive. The dynamics of the town slowly unravel and reveal a backstory that shows that things are not as idyllic as the pleasantries and scenery might suggest - the gap between the desperate and the wealthy, the lack of real love and the chronic dissatisfaction and longing for the past."
" Very good...
",0.0,0.9831,2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"""Winter Sleep"" is a Drama movie in which we follow the life of a wealthy man living in a small village with his wife. He owns a hotel and many houses in the village something that makes him even richer. His life is full of conflicts with his wife and with a tenant who owes him some rents.I was happily surprised by this movie because it was very interesting despite its long duration. Something that made the movie even more interesting was the interpretations of the cast and more specifically of Haluk Bilginer who played as Aydin, Serhat Mustafa Kiliç who played as Hamdi and Melisa Sözen who played as Nihal. The direction which was made by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, it was simply amazing and he succeeded on making us understand the struggle of the people and the family issues that our two main characters have. All in all, I have to say that ""Winter Sleep"" is an interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it."
" The movie is not long
",0.0,0.7717,2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,"It is one of the best films in the history of Turkish cinema. I would like to draw attention to one feature: The whole movie is made up of 200 hours of material. The first editing of the movie is 4 hours and 30 minutes. However, with meticulous work, it decreased to 3 hours and 16 minutes."
" One of my favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan Movies
",0.0,0.9895,2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Trying to explain winter sleep is a really hard thing. Like his other movies, this movie also takes you inside till the end. You have to think while you are watching all scenes it is not an action or commercial movie this is a piece of art. There is no doubt to Ceylan has won the prize for his movie and I am very proud of him as a Turkish man. After the success of Yilmaz Guney's movie 'Yol' Winter Sleep was the second feature movie that has won best picture golden palm from Cannes Movie Festival and iconically both of them have given the same pose after their speech at festival.If I summarize the theme. Our characters live together in a rural place together. Aydin, his wife Nihal and his sister Necla. They have a hotel in Cappadocia that is a very touristic place in Nevsehir,Turkey. In winter they live together there and stay too much together in the same place enough to come into conflict with each other. So to say, we can see confession full of angry, hate and fear. Aydin and Necla mostly discuss their ideas about life, religion and their situation. In the beginning, two of them are calm and provide useful view to each other but after a while they start to blame and throw up hate each other. They are very good at seeing the deficiencies of others but ignorant in recognizing themselves. When we look at Aydin and his wife, actually, they don't have a nice marriage that they don't stay together. They are clear-headed people so they married each other fondly, however, after they get to know one another they start to be away from each other. In one scene, Nihal shares her real and open ideas about his husband. She mentions him as a selfish person who wants to control everything and everyone around him. Then, her husband says that his wife is unfair to him and he is working to keep their marriage well.During this whole things, we can clearly see the rural place of Turkey and ideas about many situations about life. Ceylan has affected and inspired by writers like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. There is also another subject that is covered in movie. Aydin and the people around him like Nihal and Necla represent 'Upper Class' and try to define intellectual person and at the same time we see representatives of the lower class like Aydin's assistant and clergyman in the village with his family. As a consequence of this we have a chance to contrast and compare different people from different backgrounds. I can obviously say that every detail has covered in this movie too much care.Lastly, I want to mention my two favorite scenes. The Money scene and final scene. I won't give too many details in Money scene Aydin's wife Nihal wanted to help to poor family that live in village for they have a better life condition but a man does not accept this and throw the money to fire. In final scene we hear a letter from Aydin's mouth to his wife and it was very impressive and emotional. Please go and watch this amazing movie."
" Narcissistic personality disorder
",-0.4019,0.8955,2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"First of all, the main idea of the movie is based on narcissism. The movie shows us how people with narcissistic personality disorder consume each other through the differences of social classes. The movie traps you in that atmosphere for 3 hours but without boring. This movie is definitely a masterpiece."
" Remarkable piece of art
",0.5574,0.978,2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"All the movie scenes shooted in winter but somehow the movie gives incredible warmth, discussing delicate points like religion, poverty, honor, justice and love in magnificent way."
" Perfect- a combination of Tarkovsky and Bergman
",0.5719,0.9818,2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,"First of all I would say that this movie is definitely not a movie for everyone!
The movie is very slow and thoroughly builds the story. The characters are potrayed incredibly realistically, and the acting is fascinating and perfect in every sense.
There are some very long dialogues in the movie that are very interesting and open up various topics and questions but also a few boring dialogues as well.
In addition, the beauty of the landscape (mountains) in which people live is stunning!
I have a complaint and that is too little music in the beginning and in the central part of the movie (but soundtrack is amazing, it's Schubert's Sonata No 20) and some boring scenes.
To sum up I would definitely recommend this movie for all those who love Tarkovsky and Bergman, but also for all those who want to meet the cinematograpy of these two legends."

" Turkish Cinema's attempt to make Ingmar Bergman Cinema is trapped in Overlong Narrative and Over-Intellectualism.
",-0.5267,0.9636,2020-11-26 00:00:00,6,"Winter Sleep (2014) :
Brief Review -Turkish Cinema's attempt to make Ingmar Bergman Cinema is trapped in Overlong Narrative and Over-Intellectualism. When i saw Bergman films i thought this man made a big fuss out of small small issue of life but some of films really impressed me. Most of the films sounded strange and impactless because of compassionate themes, regression analysis and sort of stuff. I personally never cared much about such stuff unless the characters were truly supportive and positively portrayed according to the concept. Winter Sleep is similar to what Bergman tried years ago in modern style. The film is about a former actor, now writer and a rich man Aydin, his wife Nihal who is much younger than him, his divorved sister Necla and little bit about a poor family living as tenants in Aydin's property. It depicts the tension between husband and wife whose relationship is soulless (god knows why are they still living together), brother and sister whose thinking are on opposition directions, and between landlord and tenants at some level. The narrative is 196 minutes long for no reason because it does not come to any conclusion. The main reason is non-cinematic vision which makes the dramatic values disappear at first place. The other reason is, a narrative trying to be too intellectual becomes dumb and non semse because overuse of intellectual thoughts always end up as fisco even in real life. One can never understand the intellectual and provoking theory shown in the main characters because one cannot live life like this. Like i said, the husband and wife having no bond, no feelings at all are still together for no reason, why? The sister is over realistic and she doesn't do a thing and then herself scream about feeling bored, really? The wealthy man having enough brain of his own asks these low IQ people for help? Seriously? Don't know what kind of sense these characters made to some audience and that too when it comes without any concrete conclusion. Now, coming to the pluses, the first one is of course dialogues writing. It has some real high score dialogues that might be relevant to some people and might even change their thinking. The second biggest plus point is natural acting of the cast. Third and the last is directorial efforts took by the director to bring conviction in this inconclusive storyline. Overall, a fine attempt i repeat, 'a fine attempt' (not a fine film) to show the innermost complications of people's lives. The last thing i wanna ask is, what the hell is this film doing in IMDb Top Rated list? There are many cult films which should have replaced it long ago.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest"
" I would give 9, but I want to give 10
",0.1154,0.9585,2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"With my score I want to fight those who gave 3, 4 stars or even less. It's not understandable how someone could give a low score to this movie, it's great under all the points of view, what are you complaining for? Too long? No way! Boring? I'm sorry, but you didn't understand anything and it shouldn't be allowed to you to vote movies like this, it's totally unfair, if you don't like a movie, because for your tiny mind is boring, don't write a review, it's stupid, because giving 3 stars, it would mean involving everything, actors, director, photography and so on and you honestly can't give them only 3 stars, unless you don't understand anything about movies and I'm afraid it's so. Please, just vote Sharknado, that's the only movie you should watch.
I'm not going to say anything about the plot as I don't want to spoil anything.
It's just a masterpiece and I'm really sorry that I'm not able to understand the Turkish language, sometimes the subtitles were too quick (I'm not an English native speaker) and a few times I wasn't perfectly able to understand what the actors were saying, so I went back to read carefully. To me it was fundamental to understand every words the actors pronounced. In the end, ""my"" movie lasted about 4 hours, but I'm not regretting that as I enjoyed this movie really a lot, but honestly it's not for everybody."
" Bleak, Deep, Intelligent... Bergmanian...
",0.0,-0.9981,2020-10-31 00:00:00,9,"I didn't know what to expect from Nuri Bilge Ceylan's ""Winter Sleep"", but the title gave me the right hint. I could feel some introspective vibes from that title that sounded like Ingmar Bergman's ""Winter Light"". That the film ran over three hours did scare me a little, I dreaded the borefest but as soon as it started I knew the guide to my journey would be a competent filmmaker who wouldn't indulge into narrative tricks to entertain me. This is a serious and deep movie, that never feels too long or wordy and that can't be labeled as pretentious because it questions and even mocks that elitist pretension.Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) could be the alter-ego of Ceylan, a former actor owning a mountaintop hotel in Anatolia, which is far from the tourism-friendly archetypes associated to Turkey. Don't expect a sunny sky and shades of blue from the Mediterranean sea, we are in a place that is dominated by the natural elements, where urban turmoils have no bearing whatsoever on the inhabitants. It's not exoticism but escapism as those who live here are either too poor to move out or voluntarily exiled themselves from the city, out of an urge to find some inner peace or to fulfill some projects, others are just letting their soul hibernating, hoping for sunnier tomorrows.But isolation can either bring the best or the worst and where Aydin finds inspiration to the columns he writes and his procrastinated project of writing a memoir on Turkish theatre, his younger wife Nihar (Melissa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag) find boredom and desperately look for any possible loophole that can guide them into an oasis of meaning, even artificial. That's the paradox of people trapped together with each one going in one direction, at the end you're estranged to the closest ones. The general idea might sound too pompous but it is handled through powerful conversations where one snarky remark can snowball into more devastating and hurtful comments, revealing the characters' deepest secrets and insecurities.Aydin is a man who never refuses dialogues, he cares about people and is generally ready to listen. But within his own intellectual certitudes, he passes as an arrogant man, incapable to understand the little people, whereas the tenants of the residences he owns, people who live in religion (while he's the educated and open-minded) and with time both his sister and wife also feel belittled. Though Aydin does nothing offensive and insulting, it's all in his attitude, something that is only partially betrayed through little patronizing thoughts he shares here and there or hides behind his eloquence.But I make it sound as if the film doesn't deal with a story, there are events that break the relative monotony. A kid throws a rock on Aydin's jeep, he's the son of Ismail, a man who's been put in jail and whose belongings were confiscated by money collectors (umbeknownst to Aydin). Ismael (Nejat Isler with his piercing eyes) reminded me of the lower-class husband in the Iranian film ""A Separation"", a man incapable to feel empathy toward upper class people no matter how well-intentioned they are. He's a prisoner of his own prejudices and unlike his brother, the local imam, finds refuge in alcohol rather than religion. The brother (Serhat Mustafa Kiliç) constantly sugarcoats his words with syrupy politeness and an exaggerated smile that reinforces Aydin's perception of religious people as hypocrites and bigots.But in one of the most powerful scenes of the film, the sister blames Aydin for being hypocritical too, and judgmental, he condemns people of religion while having never set a food in a mosque and dilutes his frustration in a vain desire to please some fans. It escalates to the point that Aydin as a defensive mechanism insults her, calling her an eternal malcontent venting her post-divorce anger. Later, a similar conversation occurs when he accuses his wife of being too naïve with her fundraising projects and criticizing her lack of bookkeeping skills. Aydin can't realize that this is less a project than an opportunity to give her life a meaning. But we know a bad guy he's not and ""Winter Sleep"" is only the chronicle of isolation and how it makes people drive people into spinning in their own private areas, so much privacy that even when people discuss, you never see them in the same frames, an interesting trick conveying a double isolation.It's an existential condition that Aydin disregards as a luxury, real people have no time for such foolishness; during winter, they have to think of fire, school, food, even hunting. The film takes us to one scene to another where all is up to us is to listen to these people, to their ideas, their perceptions, an inebriated dinner leads a man to quote ""Richard III"" and rejects conscience as a trick used by cowards. In a parallel scene, when Nihar offers money to Ismail's brother out of guilt-stricken charity, Ismail acts as if her good conscience meant absolutely nothing to him. The film shows the eternal gaps between people who can afford thinking and some who can only resign themselves for better or worse, an imam, an alcoholic or a widower who tolerates adversity.Another conversation has the women talk about how we can fight evil by letting him act and see if it can self-destruct, Aydin rejects the idea without realizing that it's the exact way people behave, by surrendering to their own demons while others just let the flow of life drown them and don't bother fighting it. It's easier to deal with the evil that governs us than whatever belongs to the other. And that the most meaningful and humbles words are spoken in voice-over makes the ending bittersweet and frustrating, but so relatable. For a film so rich in communication, it's rather infuriating that a few people really communicate."
" Funniest comedy in years. Wait, it's not a comedy?
",0.8225,0.9862,2020-10-24 00:00:00,6,"This film was as bland as life drama could get. Storyline is very slow paced and very simple. It takes 3h16min for 2 ""main events"" to happen. Most movies of over 3h show at least 5 ""main events"". In other words this is a wasted potential. The setting is interesting, but they really could've done a more interesting storyline. Yes, the acting is fantastic and there's tons of great philosophy in this film, but main plot is bland. On the other hand this film is full of jokes, it's very funny, so at least I wasn't bored."
" Powerful dialogues in a winter atmosphere
",0.4215,0.9822,2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,An important film for cinema. I particularly enjoyed the game of Ayberk Pekcan playing the driver. In the first half hour the film has a very atmospheric suspense in which he has a leading role. But all actors are of unparalleled class. Powerful dialogues and beautifully elaborated atmospheric images. The psychology is very well developed and you feel like you watching in the mirror. The cast must have practiced for months because the game is very natural and believable. Long takes are not avoided and reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's better work.
" Great movie.
",0.6249,0.6294,2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie feels like you're peeking into the lives of these characters, and it can be very awkward.The story is, basically, a conflict between a landlord and a tenant. The main landlord is kind of an asshole. He's snobbish and condescending, but the tenant isn't the most likeable either.These characters feel like people. Flawed and conflicted. Their story is more fascinating to watch that it would seem at first.The film is very long and very slow, but instead of being boring, it's relaxing, despite how unrelaxed the characters may be (they spend a lot of the time arguing). It's also really tense. Tense and relaxing. Oddly nostalgic.If I were to compare it to a more recent movie, that would be Hu Bo's An Elephant Sitting Still."
" Overwhelming
",0.0,-0.154,2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"With a splendid performing of all actors and actresses revealing successfully the difficult personalities of the main characters. And a landscape scenery that is combining very well with the dramatic plot. Aydin is an ex-actor and now a writer and a small hotle owner in a Turkish vilage. The story develops itself around the conflict he has with a tenant of another dwelling who stopped paying his rent and a greatly agitated one with his young wife. This latter relationship is shown by the dialogues and conversations they have and are performed with great psychological authenticity regarding their very different personalities and she accuses him of selfishness among other things. The characters speech is very rich in moral and psychological terms. It is passionate to follow their talk.
Undoubtedly one of the best movies od 2014. But I hope there were no cruelty against animal scenes during filming. We suspect there were some with a horse in the river."
" Forever the Same
",0.0,-0.9413,2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Kis Uyukusu was the 7th feature film directed by Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Kis Uyukusu reportedly and adaptation of a short story by Chevkov (The Wife) which I never read, with one of the subplots of Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov, which I don't remember, thrown in, tells the story of Aydin (Haluk Bilginer, too close for comfort) a well-off former actor, landlord and hotel owner in Cappadocia, who procrastinates through life in the midst of unfulfilled plans and good intentions, which pave a well-known path, illustrated by his dealings with his frustrated bored younger wife's (Melissa Sözen) attempts at charity, his bored bitter divorced sister's (Demet Atbag) sharp tongue, a family of indebted poor tenants comprised of a young boy (Emirhan Doruktutan) who throws a stone at Aydin´s car, breaking a glass window and setting the film´s plot in motion, his ex-con angry father (Nehat Isler), the Imam brother of same's (Serhat Kiliç, just as impressive as Haluk Bilginer) attempts to patch things up, the release of a wild horse - arguably the only good deed in the film to go unpunished - and the burning of an envelope full of 100 Turkish Lira bills, to name but a few.Ceylan is the only director I know who can film prosaic morceaux de vie and lengthy dialogue scenes with an elegiac sense of fable. To paraphrase WWI veterans description of war as long periods of tedium interspersed by occasional moments of terror, in Kis Uyukusu life is portrayed as much ado about nothing interspersed with moments of bemused regret.Philip Larkin once wrote: ""all we have done not mattering"". Kis Uyukusu puts this verse to film."

",0.0,0.9357,2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"I was reluctant to watch this movie after the huge disappointment that was 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia'. However, this was a vast improvement and a far better example of minimalist cinema. The characters were significantly more captivating and as a result, the dialogue carried a lot more weight. As in all Ceylan's films, the setting and cinematography are absolutely stunning. Haluk Bilginer and Melisa Sozen are highly compelling and their performances help compensate for the long runtime.Still, 200 minutes is a long time for anything and the film becomes arduous in places. My other gripe with Winter Sleep is that some of the onscreen dialogue feels more like the writer's internal psychobabble being vomited onto the screen (much like a Woody Allen movie) rather than authentic conversation.Nevertheless, despite the typical art house drawbacks, Winter Sleep is very absorbing for such a long film."

Some days after the struggle, there is a script, and you forget the process"" Ebru, who often debated with him in their collaborations on screenplays opted to end their writing partnership after Winter Sleep.

BUT: I've always felt as though a filmmaker needs a really strong reason to make something that demands this much time from its audience.Something like Magnolia (1999) justifies its running time by featuring many different characters with their own (sometimes interlinking) stories. A film like Once Upon a Time in America (1984) tells an intensely personal story over a number of decades, using its length to explore interesting themes regarding friendship, growing up, and getting old. Then there are the old-fashioned epics like Ben-Hur (1959) or Gone With The Wind (1939 ) that tell gigantic, larger than life stories over a number of hours.Winter Sleep, however, does not justify its length in the same way, in my opinion. Not only could 60-90 minutes be quite easily trimmed off its running time, I feel as though doing so would actually make the film a better experience. Here we have a story about a landlord who struggles with some of his tenants whilst having marital problems with his much younger wife. The film does not span a great deal of time. There are not too many characters or subplots. There is not an earth-shattering pay-off to the proceedings (although the ending isn't bad, by any means).And yes, the acting and cinematography and all the technical aspects are strong, and yes I'm harping on about length, but I feel as though it was really the only roadblock that prevented me from engaging with the film more. I get the sense that most viewers do not feel this way, and this could be on me, as someone who needs to work on strengthening their attention span. Just my two cents, however; something I had to get off my chest I guess."

" A Great Drama, But a Little Long
",0.3716,0.9982,2019-07-20 00:00:00,8,"Winter Sleep won the Palme D'or at Cannes Film Festival in 2014. That is an impressive achievement, something that was accomplished by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994. It is the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival. However, watching the over-3-hour picture proves to be at least somewhat of a chore. If the conversations in the film were not so enticing, Winter Sleep would feel like it is longer than 5 hours. Winter Sleep is a very simple movie and a great drama at that, but audiences will not take too kindly to its length.Winter Sleep is comparable to Richard Linklater meeting The Green Mile: there is a lot of philosophical/ethical conversation going on the film which links back to Linklater, but it has the length of a slow drama such as The Green Mile. Though most of the scenes in this movie could be cut down significantly in length yet still have the same effect, every conversational scene in Winter Sleep plays out as if the entire conversation is portrayed. Most of the conversations in this movie involve the protagonist, Aydin, and the editing style of this movie makes you feel like you are truly a part of each conversation and not just observing each one from afar. That being said, this movie plays out like a long stage play, so it is definitely not for everyone, especially audience members that go to the movies for a sense of excitement. If you want to connect to characters, then you will probably enjoy this flick, but forget it if you are expecting any action whatsoever.The main character Aydin is an interesting character to study. He is quite unlikable for a few different reasons. The first thing revealed about him in the movie is that he is a landlord, and like any landlord he butts heads with his tenants. On top of that, he is an arrogant writer who tends to look down on almost everybody around him, and he cannot accept criticism that well, even from his beloved sister. He can also prove to be quite indifferent to other people: he barely shows any emotion when informing one of his tenants that he owes 100 more liras than he had led him to believe for a replacement window for his friend's car.One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is Aydin's failing relationship with his much younger wife, Nihal. One of the best sequences of the film is when Aydin and Nihal have a petty argument about whether Aydin should even be allowed in his house while Nihal is hosting a fundraiser meeting for the organization she is a part of. This leads to Aydin to verbally attack her several scenes later when he realizes his wife has no idea what she is doing in terms of bookkeeping for the funds raised. This may not sound too interesting, but the way it plays out in the film makes it intriguing to follow the conversation and see where and what it will lead to.Winter Sleep is a great character study that could probably shave off at least 20 minutes of its duration and maintain the same effect on audiences. This is a movie to make you think rather than to excite you, and if you like philosophical discussion then you will love Winter Sleep. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate slow dramas and good character development will praise this as a great film.8/10"

Ceylan establishes that the Aydin is profoundly cynical and controlling through the scene with his sister and his attempt to intervene in his wife Nihal's meeting. The 36 minute exchange that follows between the two, brutally honest and excellently acted, is entirely redundant, giving the viewer nothing new of importance from either character. It's at this point that Ceylan runs out of ideas and the film moves to the final scenes to end in a whimper, rather than finding some reason for viewers to care about this story. Too bad, because so much of it is brilliant."
" Let Me Give You Western Audiences Some Context, So You Can Have a Better Understanding of Why the Characters in the Film Are Acting the Way They're Acting
",0.4404,0.9966,2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,"As I made it clear in the title, I'll try and explain the characters' behavior, especially Aydin's and Ismail's, by explaining the culture that creates their type of characters. So this is more of a character analysis and its explanation than a review, but I might also review it a little bit. I'm typing this as I go along, bear with me.At the end of the 90s a Korean airline company Korean Air was having significantly more accidents compared to rest of the other airline companies around the world. This was not because of bad pilot training or poor maintenance or old planes, according to a theory the reason was the Korean culture. The theory claimed that the hierarchy and the power dynamics between the pilots, which was demanded by the culture, compromised a healthy communication in the cockpit. The younger person has to respect their elders and superior colleagues to the degree of not correcting their mistakes. Now, I don't know if this theory is 100% correct, but when I first heard this theory, it didn't surprise me at all, and that's the point. Culture has tremendous influence over individuals' behavior in a society. And, every culture has some good sides and then some bad ones, and boy, do we have some bad qualities to our culture here in Turkey...When Ismail picked up the money and threw it in the fire, I immediately thought to myself, most western audiences, especially Americans, will think that that's a very unlikely, unrealistic and far-fetched reaction that would never happen in real life. But to a Turkish audience, that's a very realistic scene. In schools, we are taught stories, in one of which a man chops his own arm because he's pushed too far by the guy who paid to save his life from false prosecution, well it's more complicated than that but you got the point. Why did Ismail, and his brother before him, refused this charity money, which was offered to them by a woman who showed no condescension whatsoever and on the contrary, came with all the best intentions and humility in the world? That's because Ismail has nothing in life other than his empty pride, which he evidently values even more than his son's future. He uses his pride as a cover to hide all his insecurities and inferiority complexes. In the inlands and the eastern parts of Turkey and to some degree in the slums of the big cities, the Turkish culture is to inherit oppression from parents and later, to leave it as a legacy to the children. A kid cannot question anything in life, especially religion. Women can't flirt with guys or else they are sl**s and may even got killed to restore the family's honor which is called ''namus'' in Turkish, a narrower definition of the word, slightly more specific, it is the ''honor'' of your daughter or sister or your mother not having sex or even flirt with anyone in their lives, unless they are married. This oppression prevents the youth from expressing themselves. A teenage boy cannot wear earrings or have a long hair. Girls have to cover their hair, some families start practicing this when the kid's at the age of 5. But of course, not every family is like that. These kids grow up watching the world around them live their lives, while they are oppressed to a crippling state. They become bitter and frustrated. Boys start bullying others, girls become shy nuns who will have bad marriages because they had no experience. And later in their lives, these men will have no qualities as individuals, nor a decent education. They all become ''silent heroes'' with delusions of grandeur that is completely unwarranted. Their sick ''love'' is the purest love in the world, that's why they can't accept rejection and might kill a woman who rejects or attempts to divorce them. Their ''patriotism'' is the highest anyone can have, that's why they are incapable of listening to any nuanced argument of policy, they might kill you because you are a ''traitor'' or even a ''terrorist'' to them because you want a better, secular country that invests in education and science instead of religion and propaganda. Ironically, they are the ones terrorizing the educated and intellectual people in this country, but of course this irony is lost on them. But then again, what does irony mean, try explaining that to them. This society is the major reason of the brain drain from Turkey, not the economy. They do most things banned by their religion, but they criticize others for the same things they are doing, their hypocrisy is only matched by their shamelessness and the lack of a sense of justice. If they are involved in a minor fender bender, they'll come out of their cars yelling expletives and with our version of a baseball bat in their hands, regardless of whose fault the accident is. These sexually frustrated, oppressed, uneducated, brainwashed men proceeds to perpetuate this same culture that has created them. The Turkish right wing has always liked and used these kind of men throughout the history of our country. Their ignorance is easy to weaponize and create a mob to use against their political rivals. And these poor men love the idea of a dictator, they also love mafia figures and make role models of them, because they've been taught to worship power all their lives, not realizing they are the ones who stole their lives from them. These ''silent heroes'' never rise against oppression or power, but they outnumber and gang up on the powerless, because they are very brave, indeed... So, this is the kind of culture that creates Ismail, he would never accept that kind of a charity, let alone from a woman, that's unheard of. He'd rather spend what little money his brother makes, on alcohol, which is very expensive in Turkey. What an honorable and dignified young man, not accepting that charity...Aydin, on the other hand, is not the antithesis of Ismail, not even close, despite his good education. His name 'Aydin' can be translated to English as 'Enlightened' but we use that word interchangeably with 'Intellectual', like most attributes Aydin has, even his name is very on the nose and obvious. Aydin represents the ''intellectual'' and out of touch, disconnected bourgeoisie who takes no responsibility to change the world around them for better, despite their power and influence. When confronted and called out for his selfishness(subtly by the teacher) he cries ''I didn't create the system!'' but he perpetuates and benefits from that broken and unfair system and does nothing to fix it, when he has all the power to do so. He's cynical and pro status quo like most wealthy people. It's so easy a thing to remove oneself from any responsibility or guilt, to convince that it's not your fault, there is nothing you can do about it. This kind of thinking is prevalent all around the world, but we take it to new levels here in Turkey. If you are a good teacher, your colleagues might ask you, sarcastically and condescendingly with a smug smirk in their face, ''Are you an idealist or something?'', as if being an idealist is something bad, something to ridicule... Never do anything to fix anything, why do you think it's your job to fix things? You'll get discouraged even by your parents and family if you want to fix something that's accepted as status quo. No pedestrian is waiting for the traffic lights, why are you? Is something wrong with you? Are you going to save the world by recycling? Aydin might have had a better start in life compared to Ismail, but he's only one generation away from his feudal lord ancestors, which is called ''aga'' in Turkish. His father was the aga(lord) of that village and owned everything in that village. Although we are not given enough information about his parents, knowing that he was an aga, I can assure you that he was not an intellectual nor an educated man. He probably used and oppressed the people like slaves. So Aydin didn't grow up in an ideal environment or with ideal parents either. Perhaps that's why he's so out of touch. He writes his ridiculously out of touch, pseudo-intellectual pieces like criticizing the lack of aesthetics in the poverty-stricken small villages of Turkey that are one step away from famine. Then he publishes these on a local paper which literally has one and a half readers, one of which being his sister and he can't take any criticism from his sole regular reader when she calls him out on his bs. And he is full of bs and he knows it. As he's going through his midlife crisis, deep inside, he slowly understands and accepts that he didn't live up to the expectations, best of his life is behind him and it wasn't very good even at its best. Because he has a problem of expressing his love both to a romantic partner and to his family as well. His ''trophy wife'' loved him at first, I have no doubt, but as time went through, it degraded because of his behavior. Despite all his faults, Aydin is such a likable character, because at this turning point in his life, he's showing some sings of maturing and perhaps change. He's starting to accept that he's full of bs and he admits it in what I assumed was a letter to his wife, at the end of the film. He begs his wife to accept him as he is. And the film ends there, we don't know if his pride will allow him to deliver this letter to her or even if he does, we don't know if his wife is capable of forgiving him any more...Lastly, I'd like to say a few things about Haluk Bilginer(Aydin). He gives such a wonderful performance that he makes a disgusting character somewhat likable, because his acting is so good, it makes the character realistic, instead of what would have been at the hands of a lesser actor, a caricature of a villain. His performance reminded me of Christoph Waltz and his Nazi role in Inglourious Basterds."
" Well worth the long journey
",0.4588,0.9253,2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"In the Cappadocian region of Anatolia, Turkey, Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) is a retired actor who runs a mountaintop inn and owns many local properties that are rented. He is indifferent to the many who are less well-off than he. The film centres around his desires to write while dealing with crumbling relations with his much younger wife (Melisa Sozen) and his divorced sister (Demet Akgag) who lives with them (the inn was inherited as a family property).At over three hours with no intermission, this film demands a lot from its audience especially as it is mostly dialogue. Luckily, director/co-writer (with Ebru Ceylan) Nuri Bilge Ceylan makes the best of this fine cast to make the long journey worthwhile.There are three two-way conversations among the three main characters which are long and all of them reveal the depth and sadness of many human relationships.There is also a subplot involving a poor extended family who are among Aydin's tenants. The storyline was the crux of the film's beginning but suddenly disappears until an heartbreaking encounter near the end.Some reviewers have rightly compared this film to the better works of Ingmar Bergman. Bilginer, Sozen, and Akgag all do a great job in keeping the audience engaged especially during their long dialogue scenes. Also, the beautiful and unique formations of the mountains, some of which are made into homes and other building, are a sight to behold."
" Chekhov's 'The Wife' set in wintertime Cappadocia Turkey
",0.0,-0.5023,2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Chekhov's story about an unlucky but trapped woman is brought to life against the background of a poor rural community in Turkey.
Starting off with intelligence and witty conversations the story gradually reveals the enstraged lives of an egocentric husband (once an actor and now a sequestered living landlord), his sister and his young, disillusioned wife. In the final stages both the husband and wife learn valuable lessons, but if this will help them to close the gap?
Regarding the movies theme and motives: wikipedia's description of Chekhov book 'The Wife' below, on which the movie is based below tells it all:In this classic short story, Chekhov takes a snapshot of the Russian life, illuminating the harsh complexities and yet subtle simplicities that interact seamlessly together. The cold and gloom of the Russian environment cannot compare to the relationship that Pavel Andreitch, a rich aristocratic, has with his wife, who is no longer in love, or even tolerant of her husband, although helplessly reliant on his financial support. Their disintegrating relationship is set to the backdrop of the starving peasants of the lower classes, illuminating the perennial tension of an egotistical, self-centered man and the struggling goodness of a woman who cares about more than just herself."

But as an intellectual, he is average.The film presents us with several human dilemmas, conflict areas. They are beautifully told, but they go nowhere. I don't see any depth there.If script was written by some one else, I'm sure Ceylan would see that the arguments were left unresolved, unanswered, and the end was the cheapest gimmick one could imagine.I loved watching the film, but totally disappointed with the intellectual banality."

" ""My kingdom may be small but at least I'm king here.""
",0.0,-0.8913,2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"I guess if I were looking at this movie the 'right' way, Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) would be the bad guy of the piece. He had the temerity to expect payment of rent from long delinquent tenants, he and friend Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) returned a young boy to his home after the kid threw a rock at their car breaking a window, he tried to reason with his wife Nihal (Melisa Sözen) over being excluded from a meeting in his own home regarding her charitable work, and endured a long conversation with his divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag), who admitted that she had never seen any of the plays he had written. The crux of the story seemed to rest in Aydin's relationship with his wife in a marriage that had hit an impasse after many years. She stated that he was selfish, spiteful and cynical, and maybe he was, but the story didn't really seem to lay out those qualities in the man. What it did seem to reveal was Aydin's compulsion to insert himself in Nihal's charitable work against her will, but at the same time, she appeared to be entirely secretive about it, enough to raise some kind of suspicion. And then there was the business about the burning money. I'm not sure why Ismail (Nejat Isler) would have considered it an insult, but he only added to the affront by destroying what was offered in good faith. If he was that perturbed about accepting charity, he could have used it to pay the rent he owed Nihal's husband, and used the experience to help him get back on his feet again. So maybe for this viewer, there's some sort of cultural divide that clouds my understanding of what director Nuri Bilge Ceylan was trying to achieve here. I can say that the effort was made somewhat compelling with the distinctive photography amid a rather harsh landscape. But all too often, I was left frustrated by a host of characters always attempting to sort things out without ever doing so. Maybe my problem is that I relate to the character of Aydin so much that I don't see the faults that other viewers do. Be that as it may, my opinion of the picture doesn't extend to other Turkish films, as I found both ""The Bandit"" and ""My Father and My Son"" to be more accessible in terms of understanding what those pictures were trying to say."

Watched: May 24, 2018 
Rating: 8/10 {Clue: Was filmed in this gorgeous plateau in Turkey; also known as Asian Turkey} A ""contemplative cinema"" film quite difficult to summarize- about so little, yet so much. Numerous tea-drinking, dialogue-limited, superfluous scenes where nothing of value occurs- there is no plot but it overflows with complex themes and psychological intensity (My two favorite questions: Can you force someone into an inevitability of remorse by not resisting their evil? and 
""Conscience"", ""Morals"", ""Principles"", ""Purpose""; The one who uses these words the most is perhaps the most highly suspect?) 
 
Aggressive, drawn-out discussions between brother and sister; passive-aggressive arguments between husband and wife; circuitous conversations between landlord and tenant; all create an impressively tangible and physical tenseness in the viewer- yet the characters meet with very little resolution. The ending is many things at once: devastating, difficult to understand, even more difficult to accept, and leaves one with much to ponder (That much money, wasted! How can one's pride be worth that much?) Ostensibly about a retired actor who now owns a hotel and multiple properties in meagerly populated Cappadocia, spending most of his time researching and writing, Loneliness, morality, religion, philosophy, family, marriage, philanthropy, pride, parenthood, social consciousness, the disparity between classes, though- these are the real characters. Incredible cinematography- especially some of the scenery shots in the dead of winter (My favorite is the releasing of the horse into the wild on a winter night.) Although needlessly lengthy, manages to allure with a beautiful shot or profound dialogue as boredom begins to set in.

The acting is particularly mesmerizing, it attracts you into the screen right away, and keeps you wanting more every second and that is because very little of character history is told in the movie. You have only little to predict what will happen, what can happen in the silence between each strike in the conversation. If you recall, I said ""the acting"" as if I am talking about every actor in the movie. You are correct, every single actor in this movie is incredible, but I have to give it to Demet Akbag, she particularly inspired me with her talent. It was so beautiful that I couldn't believe she was acting and thought if she was like that in real life too. It's a shame we only saw very little of her. The symbolism in the movie screams at your face in almost every scene, and you feel like you can't hold up with all these complex characters and metaphor etc. Aydin, Nihal and Necla's personalities sometimes wave into each other, and only after the movie you realize each character was actually transforming each other's personalities. The growth Aydin goes through is only so much (which was more believable) and the way to it was told was very well.I will be watching this movie to see more, to feel more. I am not humble enough to NOT say ""I didn't understand this movie"" but I am humble enough to say, ""I only understood very little about this movie"".

" the cosmically intangible yet intrinsically tangible incapability of communication among us humans
",0.0,0.989,2017-12-10 00:00:00,8,"A wisp of smoke pluming from the tussock, this is the opening shot of Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Palme d'or winning tome WINTER SLEEP, and it impeccably recapitulates what Ceylan angles to reify: the cosmically intangible yet intrinsically tangible incapability of communication among us humans. Our protagonist is the salt-and-pepper, middle-aged Aydin (Bilginer), a quondam thespian (a term which he prefers than ""actor""), who runs a mountaintop hotel called ""Othello"" in Cappadocia of the Central Anatolia. For those who are au fait with Ceylan's track record and artistic felicity, it comes as an invigorating surprise to see a concise-to-wordy volte-face here, as this 196-minutes saga is chiefly composed of long-winded conversation segments (with no embellishment of accompaniments to boot), only intermediately larded with its ongoing actions and the sublime, postcard-ready shots of the magnificent topography of the locale, which is able to rouse even the most torpid wanderlust out of hibernation, Ceylan assures us its natural beauty is unadulterated and the film would land on its feet eventually through its dramaturgic toil. With winter looming around, the hotel business is in its troughs, but Aydin's sedate life is slowly descending into a personal quagmire due to both in-house and extraneous forces. The crisis within is the irreconcilable rift between him and his closest kin, namely his divorced sister Necla (Akbag, coalescing a languid easiness with sharp-edged spite) and his wife Nihal (Sözan), who is only half of his age. Their first debate is about Necla's ""not resisting evil"" supposition, an airy-fairy notion completely throws oneself on the mercy of other's quarter, before soon it exacerbates into many a personal snide, between Necla and Nihal firstly, then a protracted sibling verbal sparring adding insult to injury, from introspectively dialectical to deliberately catty, Ceylan hits home with his onion-peeling relentlessness to censure a detrimental propensity among intelligentsia: constantly attempting to earn one-upmanship by thinly-veiled denigration. Apparently, Aydin wins this round and Necla willfully takes her bow and never returns thenceforth. The meat of Aydin and Nihal's nuptial rub comes to the fore later, starkly chaste, their relationship has already been on the rocks for years, Nihal tries to ease her ""trophy wife"" shame by plunging into a fund-raising business for schools and children, refusing Aydin's interference of any kind, apart from accepting his anonymous charity from time to time. She cannot bear his non- threatening but chronically encroaching superciliousness, yet has no moxie to put the kibosh on their marriage in gridlock. As for Aydin, he sees all too well of Nihal's fix and cunningly barters his subservience for her entrapment ""I love you, and I know you don't love me, but you cannot get your cake and eat it too!"", that is the connotation. The cruel manifestation of selfish love from those who are endowed with clout and money. And later in a conversation with a local teacher Levent (Saribacak, exemplifies cogently how to shoot the booze-emboldened sideswipes), which goes argumentative, Aydin seemingly has the final say with a caustic rejoinder but the subsequent spewing betrays that an inward damage is done.Outwardly, it is the gap between castes that writs large and cannot be mediated, the family of Aydin's hard-up tenants, brothers Hamdi (Kiliç) and Ismail (Isler) cannot pay their rent on time and the ensuing dispute becomes rather ugly, and when a broken car window impels Hamdi to humble himself in front of a condescending Aydin, the Janus-faced reality seeps into the scenario in both castes, from smile to curse, from bonhomie to grumbling, all in a trice, even Aydin's chauffeur/assistant Hidayet (Pekcan), who is not above to hector those less fortunate tenants, but meanwhile has to carry all his master's luggage in a snowfall day, with the latter wandering with idle hands, so it is not surprising to see him one minute ago promise to keep a secret at the behest of Aydin and the next minute, casually divulges it to another party on the phone, the well-adjusted equilibrium between obedience and defiance is all too close to home.Indubitably, WINTER SLEEP is first and foremost, an actor's showpiece, leading actor Haluk Bilginer competently hammers out his delivery on the strength of his word-wielding expertise and telegraphs Aydin's inscrutable train of thought when lines are not proffered. Melisa Sözen, on the other hand, brilliantly portrays a more emotionally readable persona and her best scenes are in the cathartic episode, when Nihal tries to use money to buy her conscience in front of a seething Nejat Isler (emotive with a commensurate restraint, upstaging the rest in his two scenes), and the story reaches its apogee, but in post-mortem, it is a missing opportunity that Ceylon doesn't apply his ""not resisting evil"" theory for a trial run here, which in return points up Ceylon's own guarded and idealized stance of the have-nots: they are willing to die for dignity, the only remnant left for them to weaponize. An illuminating stew of the perennial vagaries (religion, philosophy, morality and class stratification, etc.) obstructing our day-to-day communications, WINTER SLEEP mark's Ceylon's highest achievement so far for his profound perspective in fleshing out a conundrum that is elementally complex and sophisticatedly widespread."
" The slowest film I've ever seen where I was invested the whole time.
",0.0,0.9986,2017-10-12 00:00:00,9,"This is probably the slowest film I've ever seen where I was invested the whole time. That's quite a feat considering the film's glacial pace and 196-minute run time. I'll admit I don't watch a lot of foreign movies, but I'll go out of my way if I feel they're worth checking out. I heard how slow this movie was, so I went in somewhat cautious. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite movies are quite slow, such as The Bird People In China and There Will Be Blood. However, I have my limits. I have respect for the artistic merit of films like Solaris, Satantango, Werckmeister Harmonies, and The Turin Horse, and I get what they're going for thematically, but JEEZ, can we please move on? I probably sound like an ignorant jackass for saying that, but hey, that's my honest opinion.Did I fall asleep during Winter Sleep? Despite the fact that I started the movie at 9:00 pm and it didn't finish until after midnight, the answer was surprisingly no. In my opinion the film is perfectly paced for the story it wants to tell, slow enough that you feel the pace of life in the mountains of central Turkey but just fast enough to keep things moving along. The acting and dialogue are the two things that drive the film, and both are executed beautifully. All of the actors were fantastic and felt like real people. The fact that I don't recognize any of them probably helped, but even in a foreign language film its not hard to spot weak acting. Not a whole lot happens in the film, but the film remains engaging because we care about these believable, relatable characters. Movies like Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King or The Ten Commandments are engaging throughout their 200+ minute run times simply because so much happens in them that you sort of need it to be that long. For the first hour of Winter Sleep, I wasn't really sure where the film was going, but things kept escalating and tensions kept building. By the two and a half hour mark, I was on the edge of my seat, anxious (in a good way) to see how the climax would play out. If a film comprised entirely of 15-minute scene after 15-minute scene of people talking can keep me anticipating what happens next, it must be doing something right.The film is beautifully shot. We get some beautiful scenery outdoors in addition to some nice cinematography for the indoor scenes. (not really a spoiler) I like how some of the more pivotal scenes are lit only with the flickering light from a fireplace, reflecting the characters' emotional intensity. There's some interesting symbolism and religious/social themes sprinkled throughout as well.My only complaint with the film is it gets too philosophical and political at points for my taste. There are times where characters will talk about Islam, the Turkish government, and other things for like five minutes at a time. While it technically helps develop the characters and fits with the plot thematically, I felt that some of it was unnecessary and could have been cut. There are times where its needed for the plot though, like when Aydin berates his wife about laws regarding taxation on donation money (not really a spoiler).Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. If you sit back and let the film suck you in, you'll find yourself engaged. It isn't for everybody, but those willing to stick it out will hopefully find it rewarding."
" Perfect
",0.5719,0.9638,2017-10-07 00:00:00,9,"I think the best film of Turkiye is unconcerned. Turkish Cypriot wise wise ceylan the people who want to be better and who want to do it are in a last There is no doubt that there is a director who works in this film. individual issues such as social problems are very impressive presenting to a spectator on a sec.Newsehirin muhtesem The cinematography with the images shows us almost as much. At one time in anatolia, 3 monkeys, as far away as dense movies den won a golden palm feud for winter sleep. Oscar I wish the person is safe and I hope this happens."
" Except for photography and script, a waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.2,2017-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I really didn't enjoy the movie, the characters are not deeply interesting, the feelings it shows are not even visceral, it is not innovative, its not dramatic, there are no breakdowns or changes in history, not interesting at all. Even if the landscapes are impressive, the history is too flat, the regular life of almost everybody would describe better the human behavior. This movie its more like a thriller that shows only the barren aspects of peoples interactions with each other."
