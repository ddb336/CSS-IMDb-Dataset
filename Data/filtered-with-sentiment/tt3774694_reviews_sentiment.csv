" What are man and woman to each other?
",0.0,0.9238,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"A woman brings a man to life, makes a man feel human, otherwise he is mud and dust. Women make our hearts beat and continue to beat.I cannot speak for women.Woman are independent, made of iron. Is this a facade? Partly true? Something about man seems to grab a woman's soul and makes it warm.The entire movie feels like context for the final image of them in the bath, holding each other. It's such a powerful image to me it feels almost biblical... forget what you do, how you look, what your personality is like, because we are all flesh, bones, blood and soul. Their positions at the end fit like a puzzle, forming a circle, for man and women are complete together - the circle of life. There is no greater reason to live than for someone else.I really felt that at the end."

" Male objectification / bad porn, shot in slow motion.
",-0.5423,-0.843,2021-01-22 00:00:00,1,"In regular intervals from the start and throughout the non-story, you get graphic erect penis in all shades of light, doing everything it does. There is a scene where the woman receives a hand job but there is not one millimeter of labia. The films only stand-out feature is pushing the boundaries of skin, but is too scared to shoot it properly. Lars von Trier is still the guy for both skin and substance, although still downbeat since making ""The Idiots"".The actors aren't likeable in any way so you skip through it."

" A movie to avoid
",-0.296,0.1027,2020-11-14 00:00:00,4,"I couldn't watch this movie past the first 20 minutes or so, and even the last few minutes felt like I was forcing myself to continue watching and being extremely patient as I was already bored and fed up. Too many flashbacks, average or below average acting, and uninteresting characters."
" Something to be Said
",0.0,0.9101,2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"You never quite know what you're going to get from Gaspar Noe and he doesn't disappoint here. As he did with Enter the Void and Irreversible he has created a film that will not soon leave your heart, mind and soul in Love. Love is a story of mass proportions and a film to be watched carefully."
" Bold, provocative, colourful celebration of love,life and sex.
",0.3818,0.7964,2020-10-23 00:00:00,8,This movie portrays what it feels like to be in love with a person so much that their body feels like a part of yours . It features too much sex which's it's pro and it's con as after a while it's mind numbing.
" Extremely well made, despite its many shrotcommings
",0.3384,0.9601,2020-09-15 00:00:00,6,"While far less engaging than other Gaspar No√© movies, Love explores the love life of its very unlikeable protagonist with all the stylish editing, beautiful cinematography and explicit sex you would expect from him.It's almost impossible to feel any sympathy for its main character, but his story was still mostly interesting to watch. The sex scenes tie together an okay drama elevated by No√©'s unique style.Artistically and technically impressive, though aside from its unsimulated sex scenes and some trippy sequences, doesn't offer the type of out-of-body experience that most No√© fans would expect."

" Love at its rawest
",0.6369,0.9042,2020-08-13 00:00:00,10,"Watching this movie has been a transofrmative experience for me. The director pushes so many boundaries with his unique approach to portraying love and sex and almost manages to eliminate the ""fourth wall"". I don't think the dialogues are bad or under-dveloped at all (as one user noted) - to the contrary, I think they are 'fit for purpose'. Not too much, not too little.It's a movie that stays with you, makes you rethink and challenge your own perception of the correlation between love and sex as basic elements that sustain human life. It has a liberating effect on the viewer's psyche and therein lies its unique quality. In today's age of alienation, cybersexuality and virtual interaction, Noe's storytelling reminds us of our human essence and of how important it is to nurture it and elevate it.""Love"" is freedom in its purest form."
" Not great, but far from bad
",-0.7843,0.9868,2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Let's just get this out of the way, there is a lot of unsimulated sex in this movie. This is definitely on par with porn, but since it was shot with ""real"" actors it was allowed in theaters. I did see somewhere online that there is a super cut of all the sex scenes from this and it comes in at just under 30 minutes, so let that inform your decision to watch or not.This is a story of a couple that are in a very sexual relationship and decide to invite their beautiful neighbor to join them. This causes problems.If you like 9 Songs then you will most decidedly like this. Love probably features more sex but does offer a lot more plot as well."
" Artistic erotica
",0.0,0.0,2020-07-27 00:00:00,3,"As an erotic film, ticks all the boxes. The cinematography is vivid, However, the storyline is all over the place, the acting is lifeless, and the scene changes jarring."

",0.6369,-0.7652,2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,"Not sure if the movie title was supposed to be sarcastic, but there is absolutely no love in this film. The couple in the film have such a hollow relationship that they need constantly to seek to fill that vacuum with a wide array of drugs, adding sexual partners, group sex and other intersexual relationships.Maybe other more appropriate movie titles could have been: Obsession, Apathy or Dysfunction."
" Love Love
",0.8555,-0.7335,2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,"OMG some of this comments are outrageous! I get it, you don't want to see natural human interaction such as sex but you want to see murder in war and action movie...RIIIGHT... Why write such hateful things though? Just move on! This is a genre movie, it's about love, relationships, heartbreak, sex, lust, betrayal, insecurities. The actors in this are great. Beautifully shot, great character developments. I loved this so much. I do need to know what actually happened to Elektra??!??"
" Love is Possession
",0.6369,0.9585,2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Love is kind of an exhausting film to watch, but based on how the film is shot and edited, I understand that that's probably its intention.I came out of this film feeling that Love is not the idealistic thing it is made out to be. It's visceral, primal, disgusting, and somewhat like an illness. So much of this film is shot and edited so starkly that the sex scenes, especially, are exceptionally uncomfortable and bordering on repulsive to watch.Coming away from this film, it was very clear to me that this is offering criticism of the quality of millennial relationships. As youth are bound to be, this film shows how sex-obssessed young people can be but juxtaposes it with the failure of experimentation with polyamory which I found really added color and an interesting dynamic to its commentary. There's this obsession with sex and being open to the same kind of free love that existed in the hippie counter culture of the American 1960s, but millennials aren't hippies and still idealize monogamous relationships - making the celebration of free expression of sexuality to be incredibly difficult, if not, impossible.Love had me thinking but it's not a film I would recommend to the casual moviegoer or for those who aren't into the more artistic, independent side of film making.I respect this film for what it has to say as there is more to this film than what I mentioned, which gives it great thematic depth, but I can't say I want to see it again any time soon."
" Arty Nonsense

" Honest though to the point of cliche at times
",0.5106,0.959,2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Lots of intimate sex scenes, beautiful cinematography, and an incredibly real perspective on how life takes you in directions you don't always have control over. Like many of his movies, nobody is good or bad, just humans that do human things. I enjoyed his perspective when stuck with his new 17 year old partner and child, and thought it was refreshing the way in which he messes everything up, leaving room to still sympathize with him. My main issue is I was unable to fully sympathize with any of the characters: the well to do American living in Paris and falling in love with another well to do french girl in art school (of course a threesome is in order) was just a bit too on the nose for me, and took away some of the depth of the characters. Further, Murphy's blatant masculinity and Americanisms also felt more like a caricature than a character, and ultimately made him less interesting."
" I Gave it a 2 Because
",0.0,-0.6784,2020-07-02 00:00:00,2,It put me to sleep on one of those night that my insomnia reared its ugly head. Not sure why this movie was made because it was neither entertaining nor informative nor thought provoking. It was actually boring from the fist scene to the last. That took some talent I guess.
" Love this film.....NOT
",0.6369,0.886,2020-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Just now watching this film as it has come to Netflix. I have heard about this film from different resources saying that it was a hot title to watch on Netflix. I figured I would check it out, even though I had never heard about it before. I was warned that the sex scenes in the movie were quite graphic, which they are, and I am afraid that those scenes are all this film has to offer.
The premise is weak. The writing is horrible , and even the sex scenes lack passion. The best thing going for this movie is the cinematography is pretty good. That is about it.
I find it hard to imagine that someone actually financed this piece of garbage. I would be happy to know if it was filmed with a couple of Iphones, of something, because the movie has no substance. It isn't a good film, it isn't even a good porn flick."
" Thought Provoking to Say The Very Least
",-0.2023,0.9799,2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"I'm not here to claim I'm in any way a film critic, no I am here because I watched a film that sent my mind through a rolodex of emotions and thoughts. At first I was aroused from the raw gritty sex scenes that I have found myself in through out the many relationships of my time.
The voice over being in Murphys head, why am I hearing his thoughts? I asked but then I suddenly realized why because we as humans want to love and in loving comes losing. Either it be a young first lovers quarrel or the one that got away we often find ourselves asking what if.What Love the film did was bring us back into that which made it all too real and sometimes painful to watch not to any fault of the film in fact the exact opposite. The symbol of an added spice to brighten a flickering dwindling flame that we want with all of our soul to stay burning bright. That added spice being what extinguished the flame all together tells us not only as viewers of this film but as humans to be weary of just how fast the fuel burns out because once its all turned to ash there is nothing left to build with.There are undoubtedly better films out there than this but once you look past the sex and see the real life in this story it is then you will see yourself in the shower crying as the world feels like it is crashing down on top of your back with all of its weight. Sometimes what we think we are looking for is what we should be avoiding at all cost."
" This is not a film, it's well-lit porn.
",0.0,0.7894,2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,"This is one very long porn film. The actors, save for Electra, are vapid. The plot, vapid. The director feels he is truly transcend, showing bare erections on screen. Nothing about this film is transcendent, except perhaps it's ability to somehow take itself too seriously. Nothing but a sad, machismo, sexually unsafe excuse for a porn. If you're looking for pornography and don't want to have to go to a private browser to view it, here ya go. And don't let the fact that there are non simulated sex scenes trick you into thinking this is somehow ""art"". I can assure you, it isn't. Call Me By Your Name (2017) was an intensely erotically charged film and I never saw a single bare erection and yet, it was MILES ahead of this tripe. Don't watch."
" Bad movie
",-0.5423,-0.8636,2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,"Such a time waste movie. Sex cannot make any movie a hit, it should have a story. I didn't like the hero aswell. Total time waste."
" Way too much sex
",0.0,0.3291,2020-06-29 00:00:00,3,There's so much sex that it starts to distract from the plot. I wanted to know what happened to Electra but midway I stopped caring when the relationship became sexual napalm.
" Idc what anyone says, I'd die for this movie
",-0.5994,-0.2197,2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,No other film has ever made me feel so sad and so happy to such severe degrees. If it's porn then that honestly doesn't matter. It can be both porn and art.
" Porm in search of an intellectual angle
",0.5106,0.6316,2020-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Gaspard No√© is desperate. His cheap movie would have been better off as a skin flick with some narrative. Instead his TRULY flaccid attempts at being heady AND oh-so-cheaply-shocking with the opening sex scene, he could have been more sensuous. But no...The acting is 3rd rate. The cinematography is nothing special (though the DP should have made some attempt at lighting better!!) and clearly the sound department was run by a deaf person! All in all, trash masquerading at cinema."
" Childish and Boring
",-0.5423,0.9646,2020-06-25 00:00:00,1,"Gaspar should go study both Nymphomaniac films by Lars von Trier. Von Trier managed to keep his audience interested for two feature films' worth, yet I couldn't get halfway though this...mistake.The script was 7 pages long for a feature film, and it really shows. The two female stars weren't actors, but picked up by Goe at parties (""beautiful people""). Beautiful doesn't mean compelling or deep or interesting and they aren't. The all too real sex is kind of creepy, as they seem like children playing at it. For real sex, they are very disengaged. No one climaxes, no one ever breathes hard, except the guy, who gets too wrapped up in his sexual goals. Thus, there is a good reason, beyond the obvious. why sex should be acted, although I've seen much better in amateur porn vids. People who I would gladly watch a movie about afterwards. But these people...no. I was more irritated by them than anything and the terrible acting and many voice overs didn't help.If not for the sex, this film would have been lost to obscurity and thought of as Goe's unfortunate career moment. Real sex in film is not an oddity, there are millions upon millions of porn films and videos on the internet, so I'm not sure why Goe, some viewers, and some of his peers in the film industry think this is so precious and artful. What is artful about setting a camera and telling your ""actors"" to have sex? Maybe he should have told them to act like they care."
" Very explicit but not in the least erotic; worse, it's boring as hell!
",-0.9412,0.7213,2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"""Love"" opens with the kind of sex scene that was once only seen in hard-core porn but which now seems to be the norm in mainstream cinema. Needless to say, if hard-core porn isn't your bag or indeed the films of Gaspar Noe, perhaps it's best you give ""Love"" a miss. Indeed, if you enjoy the pleasures cinema usually offers then I would give ""Love"" a miss too. Noe is, of course, a master of controversy and his films are famous for both explicit sex and violence. They also tend to be visually imaginative but badly written and acted and ""Love"" is no exception, except perhaps that it's even more badly written and acted than most.With a title like ""Love"", of course, you might think the violence level will be minimal and you'd be right but ""Love"" isn't so much concerned with love, (the word is used a tad too often for my liking), but sex and lots of it and in 3D, too. This is a two-and-a-quarter hour porn movie but if it's porn you're after, just ditch this rubbish and stick with the real McCoy. Not that I needed proof, but this sure proves Noe is probably the most overrated director alive."

" What's average for Noe is still an unreachable standard for most directors.
",0.0,0.9292,2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Why the low rating? because in truth, 'Love' isn't nearly as impactful as it would like to be . By the time the second acts opens, you're entirely desensitised from the (real, unsimulated) portrayal of sex.The best scenes are lifted straight out of 'enter the void' and the low budget really hurts the not-so-great ones. By the times the credit roll in typical GN fashion, you'll be regretting this wasn't more akin to 'I stand alone'. I certainly did. Like many others said, the plot is this film's greatest weakness, and it goes to show that even one of the best directors on earth is unable to salvage a weak narrative."
" you should see this... to remember the potential of the art of cinema
",0.0,0.9677,2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Although Gaspar No√© claims this movie is a love story in the perspective of sex, i felt vice versa. Sex which is crafted beautifully and bravely is more dominant and attractive througout the film. The way love is written, however, is one of the worst amid the romance movies: shallow, basic, dull. I personally felt that if we took out the sex which became a routine from the life of the couple, there would be no relation anymore, they'd completely divide as if they were binded by only sexual feelings. Acting sucks too. I wish it took an hour less which must suffice to present what , i think, is aimed.
On the other hand, I anyway enjoyed a lot to witness rare explicit piece of photographic art. What is dared and produced is going to remind itself to me for long years even if we do not come across again."
" Love
",0.6369,0.926,2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"""Love"" isn't an erotic movie, it is strong disapproval of immorality. Murphy is a great lover, but he is libertine. Electra looks for the ultimate sex fantasy without any limits. They are lost in the party, club and unfaithful relationships. Their love will come to an ""end"", not only for Omi's unwanted pregnancy, but also for their uncontrolled behavior. To be strict or not, where lust and passion is high, love finally will be destroyed."

the courageous director Gaspar Noe Once again shows us how revealing he can be and takes us to places no other directors has taken us before.
the sex scenes in the movie besides being so open are very well made, the lighting, the placement of characters and the music are all top notch. but however the script is so weak and it's a shame that a movie that has all of those good qualities is wasted on this script.
it fails to show us the challenges they go through as a couple, it doesn't put us through the emotional states that the characters are going through and at the end it expects us to completely feel the agony that the main character's in.
and also the acting is terrible, which is understandable, because there aren't a lot of good actors/actresses who will literally cum in front of camera."
" Categorized as Romance/Drama, But Actually a Sexist Porn
",0.0,-0.5766,2020-01-27 00:00:00,1,"This is simply a porn film, with the exception that rather large and thick merkins (huge wigs for the genitals) are used on ALL the WOMEN to ensure that while you see lots of male genitalia engorged with blood being rubbed, sucked, and ejaculated onto the women's hands...there will be ZERO female genitalia. In instances where the wig cannot cover, the usual tricks of head, hand, shoulder and camera angle are used. Since this is essentially a XXX movie, I have no idea why they insisted upon not showing any female genitalia. I guess it is just that the French movie makers are just as sexist as those in the USA. Whether that sexism is driven by a the old fashioned belief that women's genitals are GROSS (which they aren't) or that women should have sexual privacy that men don't deserve. Or something else."

This movie on the other hand had no meaning and no heart. Maybe it's because I'm fifteen and I don't know what love is but in my opinion this is the complete opposite of love. Disgusting.
" As explicit as it was necessary
",0.0,-0.3018,2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I believe this movie has been widely misunderstood by people. No, it's not porn. Porn arouses people because of the engaging genitalia. 'Love' is so explicit because it wants you to actually feel the relationship between its main characters. Also, the camera angle and what it focuses on shows so much more than the superficiality of what porn shows. This movie wants its audience to understand how a couple become so codependent from each other in order for them to feel fullfilled. You can actually see the transformation of their relationship in their sex acts, how at the beginning it's more tender in comparison with the aggressiveness that it is at the end of their relationship. This movie deserves more thought before any prejudice since its message is one that should not be overlooked, it talks to you about possessive love and sincere one."

" Wish there more mainstream films like Love
",0.8646,0.9493,2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"From the opening scene, Love is provocative, arousing, and realistically sensual. I wish there were more films with full male and female nudity like this one. Unlike X rated films that depersonalize sex, I became totally absorbed with the humanness of the opening scene. Far from being offensive - the mutual touching is real, relatable and passionate. As a male, you totally relate to the intensity of the moment. The complexity of Karl Glusman's past relationship makes the plot interesting and sexually intriguing.

" A realistic journey into discovering what love means
",0.6369,0.9574,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"A movie that does not compromise with the stereotypical sinematic demonstrations around sex and manages to show us what love and relationship really means.It is difficult for a movie to have so many sex scenes and not be lecherous,but the directros have done it,telling us that sex is also romantic.The couple goes through many emotional fluctuations like happiness,hate,anger,sadness,jealousy throughout the movie, showing us the many sides of love and what a compicated and wild,but in the same time beautiful sentiment is.The raw sex scenes and the chats between the two characters are very realistic and makes us think of our moments with our lovers.When the movie comes to an end i believe every viewer will ask himself:
What is love finally?"

" A great movie for anyone with an analytical mind
",0.6249,0.775,2019-03-19 00:00:00,9,"Honestly, this is the first movie I ever watched from this director and I am amazed. I found his name by searching for directors similar to Nicolas Winding Refn.To get right to it, the opening scene is a little shocking but its cause I'm an american and used to movies not showing that stuff right off the bat. But it wasn't anything to get freaked out or something that would make me walk out of the theater.Once you get over the fact that it is sex then you start to analyse the scenes. Notice how Electra doesnt seem entirely there in the threesome. He is more into the other girl than her. I took this as a foreshadowing moment which this director did a lot of in the movie. Notice how its always sex with the two of them.Something that struck me was he always used the phone while standing in a doorway. This is another element to his character. It reveals a lot about their relationship as a hole.The music score is great and I picked up on the Pink Floyd songs. Another great attempt at foreshadowing.But, the one thing that really got me was the use of colours. Notice the red green orange and yellow that pops up from time to time. I believe red means pain, orange means love, green is fear and yellow is shy. The scene at the party where he messes around with the girl in the bathroom. Notice how the entire room is red and the bathroom is green. He is afraid at first to mess around with the girl because of Electra. But if you paid attention the scene prior when the two were talking to each other in front of Electra, they were in a red room and you couldn't help but feel the pain from electra as she had to watch him flirt.The entire movie is really about his narcissism and it plays well. I'd really like a sequel in which its in her point of view. To watch the same scenes over but get her thoughts would really make this come full circle."

A jerky and jump cut editing takes the viewer into a magic lantern of love and sex, like the cinema dreamed of by the protagonist that reflects the fundamentals of the cinema of Gaspar No√®. In the first meeting, before unruliness, Murphy and Elettra speak of love as a vital and luminous essence that leads to madness. They promise to protect each other but fall into the abyss of drugs and betrayals. Murphy even when Elettra has disappeared, he imagines her with him and begs God to want to return to their first night. Unlike ""Enter the void"" it is a psychedelic journey not after death but in a vital past whose memory brings alive a dead present.
This film is not a minor tragedy of Euripides' Elettra. It is not a minor tragedy to meet up with a woman who does not love and to live memories of love from the past."

I feel like anyone that has been through an intense relationship ends up completely crushed after this movie, not because it's sad, but because it represents LOVE so well. We are so used to the mainstream presentation of couples in movies and Love completely defies that concept. As with any Gaspar Noe movie, it touches you in a very personal way and leaves you with a nostalgic feeling. 100% recommend this movie. Would not watch it with a significant other or anyone else for that matter. V

""Love"" feels too melodramatic at times and some of the sex scenes seem a bit long. However, the overall mood and particularly the ambiguous conclusion serve as redeeming features. I was actually very moved by a scene close to the end, where Murphy's son comes into the bathroom and starts crying together with his father. I usually feel annoyed when I hear children crying, but Noe showed me something that I felt truly empathetic about: a child who intuitively felt the grief of his father and them grieving together and consoling each other - it all feels very natural. By the time I got to the end of the film, I've experienced catharsis, and that's the reason I'd recommend experiencing this movie at least once."
" Mostly disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9758,2018-10-13 00:00:00,5,"The dissection of relationships is a wellknown theme for films but this is not a good one - the main problem is the protagonist, Murphy (played by a rather bland Karl Glusman) who is, self-admittedly, only good at destroying things. It's simply neither nice nor captivating to watch a bunch of self-destructive people do their destructing, and it's also far from enlightening or enriching. Basically it's more than two hours of painful watching without any levity; the only touching scenes are the sex scenes which are really well done, far from any porn aesthetics but beautiful and the only sequences where the characters seem to enjoy themselves. Which was maybe the point but doesn't carry the story far enough to make it interesting.
The camerawork doesn't help - mostly very severe central perspectives and neatly composed still images, very much like a Wes Anderson film, but without the humour.
The music was very good, a rather eclectic mix but well chosen - along with the sex scenes, this is what saves 'Love' from being a pure disaster. Still, after the terrific 'Enter the Void' I can't feel but pretty disappointed with 'Love'.Parental advice: The characters use rather violent language in some scenes, shouting at each other and there's even face-slaps, so you might consider leaving the kids at home for this one."

I was surprised to see that the even though the sex scenes are long, it's definitely not the whole movie, neither it feels like porn. The problem relays in the fact that I've seen porn with more content than this. More artistic, better edited. That should give you an idea of what type of film this is. The protagonist is insufferable. I hated him 5 minutes into the film. And we don't get to know the rest of the characters either, in consequence, you don't really care what happens to them. The performances are mediocre. At times it truly feels like an amateur project. The shots get repetitive and boring and the dialogues fall flat. This a good idea, let's show a relationship from a sexual point of view without censoring. I appreciated that but where's the real intimacy, the real feeling. I have no idea. Nymphomaniac did it. I haven't met anyone who has seen that movie and hasn't feel overwhelmed. There's emotion, pain, struggle. The main topic, of course, is different, but I think you get the point.

" Well-made project but ends up tripping over its own interpretation of reality.
",0.0,-0.9382,2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Overly ambitious project about a millennial love arc that ends in heartbreak, but what are the lessons learned? Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an open-minded film student in Paris who meets Elektra (Aomi Muyock), and the two embrace their high sex drives with giddyness. However, after the relationship embraces polyamory and swingers culture, only one of the two is emotionally stable enough to handle it.The film is directed really well by No√©, who by now should know well enough how to make it all super claustrophobic and uncomfortable for the viewer. The cinematography is good but relies too heavily on saturation but it's never really an issue. Nonlinear storytelling is clear, concise, and there's some really neat editing at parts. The story does drag often, and the film overall could've cut out 10-15 minutes of filler.The real issue with ""Love"" is the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Elektra -- we just don't see it, pretty much ever. The writing is there, but the actors just cannot grasp it. This is largely because -- are you ready? -- they aren't actors; No√© met both Glusman and Muyock in a club one night and asked them to star. It's clear that he wanted to achieve the most organic and natural relationship dynamic on-screen by not using ""real actors"" -- but in what is supposed to be an emotionally charged film, that just doesn't work.In fact, in a sort of disturbingly surreal manner, the very same issues that the film is trying to highlight in millennial relationships (emotional maturity and boundaries over sex) seem to show up in the unsimulated sex scenes between Glusman and Muyock. Glusman constantly falls out of character, allowing his own sexual desire to ruin the scene and any emotional impact No√© was looking for. Muyock seems bored and uninterested -- and who could blame her? -- likely due to Glusman's obvious zeal about getting paid to fuck her. I'm not sure he entirely understood the fact he was in an art film, and in remaining ignorant, he ends up verifying No√©'s entire thesis: young adults, especially men, get lost in the idea of sexual nirvana over the thing that truly matters: love.The second half of the film lifts the veil on Murphy's narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior in the relationship, and tragically, Glusman is a good actor when portraying an unstable douchebag (and Muyock is phenomenal when screaming at him).The film finishes the same place it starts, seeming to depict Murphy at rock-bottom in a horrible and accidental family dynamic: a fitting bookend to a relationship that was destroyed not by too much sex, but his own fear of it. The ending is eerie and powerful, and hints at the generational ripples that will be felt for decades because of his own actions. It's a great story, and sort of well-acted, but it ends up merely tripping up on its own interpretation of reality instead of offering us anything particularly new."

Why such outrage in the reviews is beyond my understanding, - is the sight of two (or three:) people making love is that offensive? Are these people plan on never having sex? Obviously they never seen any porn, if they calling this movie porn! ""Love"" is a meditation on physical intimacy, with beautiful cinematography, mesmerizing soundtrack and hypnotic performance by Aomi Muyock, that is certainly worth watching and does not deserve the low rating it has on IMDB. I personally was really touched by the use of Erik Satie's ""Gnossiennes"" throughout the film, as it's one of my favorite pieces of music, and I always felt there's a flair of understated sensuality about them.

" A warning on the power of intimacy
",-0.34,0.999,2017-09-30 00:00:00,9,"No√© has never been one for making upbeat, happy films and Love is no different. It is, in essence, a love story, but moreover a lust story about how we can become imprisoned by our emotions via our need for validation and fulfilment. We can become captive physically, emotionally, situationally, psychologically. Love is told in typical No√© fashion: starting with the most recent events, it draws us rearward in time through a series of flashbacks before simultaneously presenting us with the root cause of the dire consequences the past has wrecked for the main character, Murphy. Murphy is an American in Paris in film school. One day he meets the beautiful artist Electra at a party and the two find that they have similar views on love, life and a shared need for intensity. They quickly form a relationship and their sex life is very healthy: they have sex frequently, intimately, closely, Electra at one point challenging Murphy to show her just ""how tender"" he can be. Unfortunately, acting out their sexual fantasies ends up proving the demise of both their relationship and their freedom when they have a threesome with Omi, a slim, pretty 16 year old blonde who moves in next door. Murphy continues a relationship with Omi behind Electra's back and Omi falls pregnant, deciding to keep the baby since she is ""pro life"" in contrast to Murphy who is ""pro choice"". Electra and Murphy split, leaving him to bring up the child in his own flat with Omi, a situation with damages his freedom and his creativity, eventually leading to depression. Electra disappears and becomes uncontactable, most likely committing suicide, as she threatens to do if the relationship between her and Murphy collapses.The film heavily centres on the duality of the past and the present. Within Murphy's Paris flat, the past is usually lit in red, emphasising excitement, sexuality, passion, danger, risk. The present, on the other hand, is lit in green, a safe, benign, calm, but slightly sickly colour being the opposite of the libidinous red. The 'red' scenes are mostly at night whereas the 'green' scenes are in daylight with rain pouring down outside, signifying the sadness of Murphy's inescapable situation. When Murphy is with Electra in the flat the flat is a mess: it is full of film posters, books everywhere, it is a very much an artist's flat. With Omi it is stark, organised, clean, controlled. It is the flat of a family man disciplined by his situation and his female. Murphy feels constantly trapped, keeping one shelf of his 'old life' tucked away in the corner, his old life made entirely of memories of Electra. On the shelf is a VHS (not a DVD, again signifying age and format change) of No√©'s first film I Stand Alone, a nod to times gone by, personal development and the fact that, in the end, we are indeed all by ourselves. Murphy remarks in his mind that when one invites a female to live with them it's like ""getting in bed with the CIA"", absolutely everything is known, there is no privacy, no identity and little freedom.Of particular note is the sex in the film, which is explicit and frequent. This is typical of No√©, he presents real-life situations unglossed by some ultimative veneer. The sex in the film is not only meant to titillate but to show intensity and intimacy and the beauty of closeness between couples. It draws us into the moment, as it does the featured characters. But it also shows us the difference between types of sex (and types of love): when Murphy and Electra are alone enjoying each other it is beautiful, close, almost enviable, but when they have their threesome with Omi it feels awkward at times, forced, maybe not how they imagined. At one point in the long sex scene with Omi Murphy penetrates Omi from behind with Electra enjoying her on the other side: in this way it is the start of Omi 'getting between' the two of them. In essence, as with so much of No√©'s work, Love is a warning. It is a warning about the consequences of making bad choices. The backwards-style storytelling shows how Murphy gets himself trapped in a situation through nothing but his own lust for Omi ‚Äì it is entirely his fault after all ‚Äì and as he says the only thing he is good at is ""f---ing things up"". In the process of following his emotions, his own lust and need for intimacy, he throws away his relationship with Electra, his creativity, his old life, whereas Omi also falls prey to her emotions by deciding to keep her child (her reasons for being pro-life whilst also being a meat-eater appear emotional rather than rational too, when challenged by Murphy on this point she has no reason other than ""well, it's different""). At the end of the film Murphy fantasies/reminisces about holding Electra in the bathtub of his flat, where in reality he is now holding Gaspar, his child, with Omi outside in the hall, outside of his subconscious. The borders of the screen shrink to a square to emphasise the captivity of his situation, the white tiled walls of the bathroom, where his happy memories of Electra began, appearing now like the walls of an asylum or a concentration camp. As is told so many times in the film, love is the greatest thing in life... but with great power comes great responsibility. Love of any kind can be beautiful, exciting, passionate and fulfilling, but it carries risks, and mistreated and unchecked, it can bring unwanted results. Love is more powerful than we often care to admit to ourselves, and with this film No√© is showing us the largely negative consequences of love on freedom. As Murphy is told by one of his ex girlfriends: when you fall in love, you ultimately lose out."
" Most intimate and vibrant
",0.5667,0.5979,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"First of all. I'm a huge fan of Gaspar No√©, so my review may be biased somewhat by that. Still, this movie delves into subject matter very unlike Enter the Void, and differs greatly also in its flawless execution. There are many silent moments, as is Gaspar's style, but they aren't empty and vacuous, like in Enter the Void, meant to render in the viewer a sense of aimlessness and confusion, and they're not meant to give you a respite from the vibrant sexuality of the film either. Instead they suffuse exactly the tender sentiment Gaspar was seeking to meld into his project. The film is a tremendous achievement, his somatic style vibrates from the screen and seduces you into the physicality of love. You feel aroused, no doubt, but it's an enveloping arousal, not the two dimensional kind of appeal one would expect from a movie with this caliber of sexuality. No, this is four dimensional; indulgent and honest and raw and desperate and human. The spectacular performances by the relatively unknown actors deliver aching, intimate and haunting sensations. You're there with them. That's the director's touch and it's not easy to achieve. The story is very deep, its foreground tragedies very sharply felt and you're left sad, vulnerable, full of regret and yet also gratitude that you were able to experience love of that magnitude, with all its divine glory and cruelty without actually being stuck in the characters lives. And yet it was a just a movie. And yet it wasn't."

It's an arty and very well made film about love. It's not always rainbows and butterflies. What I love about Gaspar Noe is he takes risks and experiment with the films. Most of his films are controversial then people start liking it as no one likes a change in the beginning and I love creativity. This film has a very simple plot, simply made with simple acting if you want to watch it expecting some unrealistic cheesy rom com Hollywood commercial film because name of the film is LOVE then this is not for you. Reading people reviews here, repetition of the word ""PORN"" because of unsimulated sex scenes and a lot of sex scenes. There is a good story to the film and the sex scenes compliments with it. I have always been in favour of unsimulated sex as it is one of natural act which every adult goes through. It's about time when people should watch sex scenes without feeling uncomfortable and without the idea that every time you watch unsimulated sex scene you have to play with yourself. I just find it ridiculous, it is just a natural act. Get over it and fix your brain. If people feel uncomfortable with that do some research before you go and watch a film if unsimulated sex makes you feel uncomfortable why did you go on the first place to watch it?A great film !! must watch !!"
" A lengthy study of hungover sexcapades
",0.0,-0.9451,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"There's been discussion about whether there should be sex scenes in movies at all. There are those who claim that they are distracting, offer nothing to further the story and could be skipped and nothing would be missed. Sometimes they are outright obscene. I find myself on the opposing camp. I like my movies controversial, and I think movies shouldn't shy away from subject matter because it is 'risky'. Sex is a part of life, it's emotional and intense and important, so it makes sense that movies would delve into it.Now 'Love' is a movie that borders on pornography, that's how deeply it delves into the matter of sex. The plentiful sex scenes are reportedly unsimulated - meaning the actors actually really have sex on screen, which is enough for many to label it obscene. And obscene it is. The film is full of depravity, sexual lust, fetishes, and generally morally reprehensible behavior. So if you don't go for that kind of thing, you should steer clear of this movie.I saw a review of 'Love' calling it pretentious. I don't think the movie is pretentious so much as the main character himself is, spouting off about 2001: A Space Odyssey and how he's going to be a great director. He's not a very respectable person no matter how you look at it. He cheats on his girlfriend and when he has to take responsibility and raise a baby with his hook-up, he constantly pines for his days of fooling around and doing drugs. Actually, he never really stops doing drugs.The story - and the 'message' - of the movie is about how the young American film-maker idolizes French bohemian sexuality and freedom, but ends up getting sick of too much of it. But it's not a French movie and not an American one. It's simply a Gaspar No√© movie, and it shows. There was barely any script, no guidelines or rules in making the movie. It's the director's movie, completely focused on style and theme, color and composition and rhythm, largely disregarding story and even characterization. There are frequent short 'black-outs' all over the movie, which made me think that my copy was faulty somehow. The movie has a unique flow, it's nonchronological, following the thoughts and memories of a character suffering from a terrible hangover.I have to make a comparison to 'Blue Is The Warmest Color', which really is a French movie, also has a lengthy running time, and also features a whole lot of sex. That movie was emotional and relatable, it was like a look into a life that was really lived, and despite the controversial lesbian sex scenes it strangely had a lot of innocence in it. 'Love' is like the drug-drenched, depraved, delirious and destructive, nihilistic counterpart to that movie."
" The story that was narrated backwards!
",0.0,0.9696,2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"This was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told in backwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9¬Ω Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.I wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.The other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.4.5/10"
