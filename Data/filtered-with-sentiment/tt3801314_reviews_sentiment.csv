" Best film
",0.6369,0.9274,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"After watching this film my respect to farmers increased a lot.
Speaks about the reality of life's of farmers,
One of the best film which made a strong impression about farmers hardwork in my heart."
" Kaththi is a must-watch Vijay film
",0.0,0.998,2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"A.R.Murugadoss who made a strong and intense social message film, Ramana, is stepping back in the same shoes with Kaththi but this time with a different treatment. If you already watched Ramana, you will come to know that Ramana wasn't an entertainer but a very serious film that speaks loudly about corruption in India. In Kaththi, he tries to make a social message film but within the usual Vijay film template which might be something new to witness on screen. Vijay hasn't tried much in doing films that focus on social issues. Let's see how Kaththi worked? Speaking about the farmer's issues, Kaththi's main purpose is to create awareness about the importance of water and farmers in our society. A.R.Murugadoss builds smartly a film that would not only deliver the message but also satisfy the hardcore Vijay fans and create a huge impact after watching it. Speaking about Vijay, he is a real entertainer. He makes us laugh, smile, and most importantly cry. He is playing a dual role in this film: one as an escaped prisoner Kathiresan and another as a hydrologist from the village Jeevanandham. Having no big differences in the looks, Vijay differentiated these roles through his effortless and impactful performance. It's worth mentioning that Vijay's performance lifts this film to a great extent and it's definitely one of his best performances to date. Vijay as Kathiresan was electrifying on-screen with Anirudh's fire cracking background score. It's again a superhero kind role but it has some grey shades which is interesting to watch on screen. I definitely want to speak about the Jeevanandham character. He is innocent and soft-hearted. He wants to fight against the corporate but he is overshadowed by the betrayal of those who he trusted wholeheartedly. The scene where he says ""Yen Uyire Ponaalum, Vivasayatha Vitrathinga"" is hard-hitting and so emotional. There's interesting emotional connectivity between his character and the audience which serves as a huge pillar for this film. Vijay's performance as Jeevanandham will be remembered forever. Other than Vijay, there are few supporting actors who had left a strong performance in the film. The main antagonist, Neil Nithin Mukesh, has delivered a good performance in his very first Tamil film. Coming to A.R.Murugadoss, he has made one of the best films of his career. After Ramana, this is definitely a film that would stand unique for its strong content and social awareness. The film is properly packaged as a wholesome entertainer. One of the major drawbacks of this film is the song placement right after the strong and intense interval. I felt that it just letdowns the intensity of the narrative unnecessarily. Apart from that, I feel that A.R.Murugadoss worked well in his writing and delivered a strong film. Overall, Kaththi is a must-watch Vijay film."
" Mass commercial entertainer with a heart.
",0.3818,0.8334,2021-01-29 00:00:00,10,"If you want to watch something that is logical, and abiding by the laws of physics, don't watch this. But if you want to watch a movie that entertains you, and grips your heart at times, then Kaththi (Knife) is highly recommended."

" VIJAY AT HIS BEST
",0.6369,0.9201,2020-05-25 00:00:00,10,THE BEST EVER ACTING AND POWERFUL PERFORMANCE FROM VIJAY AND CONSIDERED TO BE HIS FINEST AND WELL WRITTEN MOVIE REMAIN KATHTHI AND THUPPAKKI. IT IS DEFINETELY GIVES US A STRONG SOCIAL MESSAGE .THIS WAS THE MOVIE WHICH MADE ME A VIJAY FAN IT IS SAD THAT HE IS DOING MOVIES LIKE BIGIL NOW A DAYS
" A GOOD ONE TIME WATCH !!
",0.639,0.9734,2019-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Director A.R. Murugadoss is largely successful in presenting story with a socially relevant theme weaved into a superstar action blockbuster narrative.Vijay, in a double role, looks better than ever and has tried to flex some acting muscle too. While Anirudh's background score is rocking in several sequences, the same cannot be said about his songs.While movies which are star vehicles generally lack logic and try to mint money by through sheer superhuman characterisation of the star, Murugadoss, despite succumbing to much of those demands, deserves kudos for harnessing the star power to underline important issues like livelihood of farmers and market-driven media within a structure of a masala entertainer.The length of the movie is a definite dampener, especially those from a bloated first half (Diwali overeating ??) which could've been culled by Sreekar Prasad. Alas, it seems his hands were tied by supposed ""Commercial"" constraints.Overall, if it had been trimmer by at least 30 minutes, this is one Kaththi (knife) which would've been sharper and could've pierced deeper !! Yet, it is better than a mere butter knife, thanks largely to Murugadoss' writing."
" Oh please!!
",0.4374,0.4282,2019-10-08 00:00:00,1,"When will kollywood stop making movies like these. Just add a social message to any movie BAM!! It's a blockbuster.
2 protagonists who look similar - so similar that even their mothers won't be able to tell
A heroine completely irrelevant to the plot
The protagonist who is a con man with no proper fighting skills turns Bruce Lee and defeats 50 goons. Seriously!!!
Can't believe this and hey ram you which is a much better movie have similar ratings. DAMN"
" Kaththi
",0.0,0.891,2019-05-12 00:00:00,5,The movie was good only because of story and dialogues and BGM. Jeevaanandham character acting was good. BGM were good in the movie. AR Murugadoss direction was good.
" Sharpest Forever
",0.0,0.9791,2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"Milestone movie from ARM who showcased the actor in Vijay to his best.
It has a core plot. strong cast, much deserved songs & BGM by anirudh, excellent cinematography, song choreograpthy was exceptionally done, Spine chilling action sequences and that hero worship mass moments placed at the right spot that fitted well in the film . Its a perfectly designed, scripted and tuned movie by ARM and Vijay who drove it to success."
" Right content with Right commercial elements
",0.0,0.9875,2019-03-14 00:00:00,9,"First of all it wasn't a stry that is as good as thuppaki since the expectations for the combo is huge and the songs were chartbuster people who expected something bigger than thuppaki might get disappointed but in due course this is a perfect new age mass masala with some very good content. Though it may not be as perfectly executed as thuppaki
But the later half stands tall to save the movie
The 1st 30 odd min was really draggy expect the kathiresan intro sequence
It literally showed that murugadoss's struggle to get into the crux of the story bt once the flashback scenes picks up there shines the writer
20 min long flashback is the heart of the movie and it was really nice to see vijay performing his heart out after a very long time
Starting from interval the 2nd half had a hand full of mass moments with a ok antagonist and a average climax
Apart from vijay and ARM, it was Anirudh who stood as a pillar with scintillating backgrnd and chartbuster songs
Analarasu and george to gave notable contribution
Vijay was at his best through out
And ""jeevanantham"" was a pleasant surprise from both the director and the actor
Hope ARM gets his hands on to get into story in a better way
To summarise kaththi - A vijay film in Arm styleðŸ”¥"

" Kaththi, A Good Social Relevant Movie

" Emotional!!
",0.2924,0.8268,2018-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Ar Murgadoss find the very best way to convey the undergoing issue in Tamil Nadu, India. Some scenes was very emotionally touched. Vijay acting was tremendous. Anirudh BGM is one of the big strength to the movie."
" this movie mentioned some future incidents and created awareness about the issues farmers face in India.
",0.25,-0.3096,2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"You can make a documentary about agriculture in current scenario and the problems faced by the farmers, but that will not reach masses in the proper sense. But A.R.Murugadoss through his screenplay he had mixed commercial elements to create a public awareness about the issues farmers facing in Tamil nadu. Actor vijay had handled the dual role with brilliant acting. The consequence after this movie was too such a extent, it had connected it with the protest happened in Chennai for jallikattu and now here in Tamil nadu 80% of the shopkeepers refuse to sell Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Since those companies suck excess of water from the drought facing Tamil nadu."
