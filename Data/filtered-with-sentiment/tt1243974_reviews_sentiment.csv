" Just plain Bad
",-0.5423,0.1195,2021-03-03 00:00:00,3,"This movie is just plain bad from beginning to end. The plot makes no sense, the dialogue makes no sense, and some scenes are so bad they make you cringe. Emma stone I think is channeling Marcie from Charlie brown and Bradley cooper must have been high when he made this movie. I love when he howled out the car window for no reason. I guess cause he goes hard and he goes deep and sometimes he breaks things. Also dont forget three day beard boy, mr. Sexy pants Alec baldwin great dialogue in that scene. This movie is so bad you have to watch to make you laugh."

It's funny, some times Depp, not everyone understands that."
" Aloha (2015, Cameron Crowe) Bizarrely confused misstep from Crowe
",-0.3182,0.7552,2021-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Aloha (2015, Cameron Crowe)
Cameron Crowe is somewhat of an anomaly. He produced some truly amazing films including one of my all-time favorites in ""Almost Famous."" Recently he has had some missteps with his films including his last outing ""We Bought a Zoo"" and again with his latest film, ""Aloha."" He assembles an amazing cast and sets the film in Hawaii but every performance is out of bounds weird from Emma Stone's crazily energetic fighter pilot to John Krasinsky's almost mute performance playing Rachael McAdams air force pilot husband. This film also tries to pull itself in two utterly opposite directions. There is the fairly standard romantic comedy angle and then there is this serious side dealing with the privatization of space travel headed by Bill Murray in another completely odd casting choice and rare non-comedic, antagonist role for Murray. Bradley Cooper plays Brian Gilchrest who was an Air Force guy who messed up in the field and found himself ostracized. Now he is invited back in on a limited basis as a contractor and he returns after years away to Hawaii where his ex has remarried and the Air Force pairs a young, up and coming pilot with him to babysit him or monitor his activities or something like that. Like a lot of this film many of the motivations are unclear. What's clear is that there is going to be a very odd, awkward love triangle between Stone, Cooper and McAdams and an even odder working situation as Cooper struggles with the ethics of working for Murray who may be attempting to take his control of space travel to the next level by deploying weapons in the sky which would be controlled by his company. Mix into this completely odd, politicized romantic comedy Hawaiian lore and legends, and you have a film that just meanders all over the place and never really finds its way. This film is just a hot mess from start to finish with it's odd storyline and completely wacky performances from just about everyone involved. I always hope that Crowe will return to the form that brought us such gems as ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" but here again is just another swing and a miss.

" The worst of Hollywood signals their virtue.
",-0.3182,-0.6369,2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"In this pointless romcom, a bunch of amoral characters make themselves feel special by sabotaging the American military for no good reason, while covering up their own nefarious affairs, past and present. Crowe directed his own story (I doubt another director would touch this pablum), while the actors disgraced their profession through an incredible degree of hammy overacting...most notably, Alec (the Spanish Husband) Baldwin. It's like none of these ""name"" actors had anything to do for a week and said, ""Let's take off and get high for a few days and put it on film."". Awful."

" A light heart romance film!!
",0.6351,0.9859,2020-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Aloha is a 2015 American romance film starring Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and Rachel Mcadams. I wouldn't class the movie as a comedy more of a romance. Cant not understand the low rating and it should be more don't base it on the rating and watch it. Great acting especially from Bradley Cooper with a very nice storyline. I really enjoyed it and was very believable. All cast movie from great actors and actresses. If you want to watch it it's streaming on Netflix right now. All I can is if you like romance then this your movie go and watch it."

There is no chemistry with Emma Stone and the plot with Rachel McAdams is awkward. This was boring and not really entertaining. I kept hoping for it to perk up, but it never did. I can't believe actors read this script and agreed to do it. it seems like they added in Bill Murray at eh last minute and made up really bad dialogue. This was so bad."

" Its charms far outweigh its flaws!
",0.4926,0.9929,2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I had never even heard of Aloha - it apparently bombed and disappeared quickly in 2015 - but searching for a distracting film during this COVID period, I decided to give it a whirl. So glad I did, despite the poor official reviews.What makes this film worth watching, despite a too-busy plot and some choppy editing, are the performances of this wonderful cast. They wring every possible shred of touching humanity out of the script. I loved watching the evolution of Bradley Cooper's beyond-cynical, ex-soldier defense contractor, from embittered torch-bearing wounded shell, to a man reinvigorated by the possibility of real love with a quirky partner, Emma Stone, who is more than his equal. The chemistry and interactions between all the four main characters feels real and unforced. Yes, they are all ridiculously attractive, but the way each actor thoroughly inhabits their role, and commits to the characters' interactions is what made this film work for me. If Cameron Crowe had abandoned the over-the-top, way too ambitious sub-plot of the evil defense contractor worming his way into the space program (while Bill Murray is always an asset, both he and Alec Baldwin morph into cartoonish caricatures by the film's end, and feel like an intrusion), and focused more on the evolution of the main character's relationships, the film would have been a thorough winner. Lose the ""I'm 1/4 Hawaiian"" aspect of Emma Stone's character, which is needless and offensive, and focus more on Cooper's evolving redemption as a human, I would have told Crowe. But then again, he didn't ask me. ;-)I've never been a huge Bradley Cooper fan before, but I fell in love with him a little bit after this movie, due to his fine performance. And Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams and John Krasinski are right there with him, matching him step by step. I plan to watch Aloha again, and savor some very fine acting. Critics aren't always right."
" Great to watch
",0.6249,0.9501,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,So the plot was a bit lame. The actors were fantastic. I usually only half watch movies. But the interactions hooked me. I watched every expression. Cooper was brilliant. Stone mesmerized. But Danielle Rose Russell sealed the deal at the very end of the movie. Her bit part after the main plot had played out will be added to my short list of movie best scenes ever. Go Danielle!
" I went through the unbelievably long and unnecessarily convoluted process of verifying an IMDb account just to defend the loveliness of this movie
",0.0,0.9896,2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"Please ignore anyone who gave this movie a poor review. They are too dense to see the multifaceted and nuanced humanity this movie presented so beautifully. I'm sure Michael Bay is those folks' fave director and they watch The Kardashians religiously.But to the rest of us, this captures the intricate layers of what it is to be human. To work, to enjoy your work...and love and to move on from old love to new love and the growth that comes with it. To attempt to do something more in life and to laugh and make mistakes, and then freak out that those mistakes were a national security risk.I don't know how people didn't love this movie. It has some of the best actors of our generation (Emma Stone is a treasure) used expertly and is an exercise in both verbal and nonverbal communication as well as the depth that comes with age. These characters are real and not 2 dimensional tropes. Go watch and give the negative reviews a solid middle finger and question their intelligence as well."

And I normally really don't like Bradley Cooper at all. For me it's his best movie! And of course all the other actresses and actors are great! Every single one!This film has so many layers describing life and what it is all about. It's simply everything, funny, awkward, deep, touching, moving...

" Uggggggg
",0.0,0.7858,2020-02-28 00:00:00,1,"Beyond the fact that this movie only made back $26 million on a $52 million dollar budget, Aloha was hit with the issue of whitewashing, as Emma Stone's character is supposed to be one-quarter Chinese and one-quarter Hawaiian, yet is - you know - played by Emma Stone.Oh Cameron Crowe. You started with Fast Times at Ridgemont High and then, well...I know, I know. There are plenty of people who adore Jerry Maguire. Some people enjoy Almost Famous. But even less are down with Vanilla Sky. And then, still less like Elizabethtown. Dwindling returns.This is a big ensemble movie about Hawaii and the air force and it's kind of, sort of the future and all manner of Hollywood celebrities are in it and it commits a bigger sin than this giant run-on sentence. That sin is that it's incredibly boring.Military contractor Brian Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper) is the nexus that this revolves around and most of the movie is about how he's the wrong guy for every woman, from his ex-girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) and the space-loving Captain Allison Ng (Stone). Bill Murray shows up as a billionaire who is trying to get into space. Everyone loves space in this movie, which I would too, because it presents Hawaii as perhaps the most ennui-inducing land that has ever been.John Krasinski, Danny McBride and Alec Baldwin all got roped into this as well. Becca made it approximately twenty minutes into the ride while I stayed buckled in and made it to the close of the film, which is meant to draw deep emotion and motivated me to eject the DVD and try to not snap it in half before I brought it back to the Redbox machine, where this virus of monotony will infect another unknowing subject.That said - I've seen stacks of this movie at Dollar Tree, so if you need some insulation or would like to ruin someone's life, it makes for a fine and inexpensive gift."
" One of the best movies ever made
",0.6369,0.9818,2020-02-18 00:00:00,10,I love the way they have made this movie about everyone in it. It's an adorable love story that just makes you so happy to watch. While it's one of the funniest movies i've ever seen it's also sad. It's really about a guy trying to pick up the pieces of his life while finding love and getting back to the friends that has always been there for him. It's funny to watch the relationship to everyone cause it's so realistic.

",-0.4939,0.977,2019-11-16 00:00:00,3,"Very perplexed by this one... Did I just enjoy myself? I don't think I did...The talent in this movie lived up to their names and the chemistry was definitely there. The acting was the only thing that kept me watching really. That being said, watching this plethora of story lines unfolding felt very disjointed and uncomfortable.I wasn't sure if it was maybe supposed to be some sort of parody because of some of the outlandish & goofy scenes and plot points, but it wasn't at all funny. The whole thing felt a little forced and as many others said, like it just didn't know what it wanted to be.One slight redeeming factor is that I did appreciate the ode to non verbal communication. But again that is attributed to the A List casting.I think in theory this could have been a great movie had it had some direction and a few subplots shaved off (or at least blended/smoothed out.)Other than the stellar cast, I honestly can't fathom why anyone whole heartedly enjoyed this movie... I dont actually believe they did.The only reason I'd recommend this to a friend is to see if they could explain to me what I missed that would make this a good movie."
" Delightful, warts and all
",0.5859,0.9876,2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"I've now seen the film six times. Emma Stone steals the film with charm, humor, tenderness and vulnerability. Bradley Cooper is completely charming, with vulnerability and excellent comic timing. And has never looked better. Rachel McAdams, as always, is perfect. John Krasinski is delightful, showing signs of the star he'll soon become. Comic cameos by Murray and Baldwin and others are superb. Yes the big finish is unrealistic but it really isn't the point. It's a love song to Hawaii, and the four leads. Great soundtrack too. Best Christmas party ever."

Dialogues developed very quickly jokes were meaningless I never understood some jokes.After leaving the first 30 minutes of the film behind, we begin to understand the film a little more at least the main issues but of course, there is still a mess. So actually the subject is nice but taken trouble in processing the subject. Film footage is great because of the Hawaii, mystical Hawaiian air wanted to be caught which is very successful you also feel a different sense of sadness.I would have liked it if there hadn't been such complex transitions or had it been so fast or it would have been better if more drama had been put out of space. Space-related parts were a little ridiculous I know it's a comedy weight, but it still sounds ridiculous. Especially the latest satellite explosion
scene.
the performances of the players were great maybe they were the ones who saved the film from mediocrity.
Starring Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, and Rachel McAdams and also all cast crew was quite successful."

I like they played together in the movie cuz I like them but the story is normal.I knew after seeing the movie that people accused this movie of whitewashing the casts.

Loved the Air Force and space interest aspects. Loved Emma as a fighter pilot badass with a heart of gold. Loved the scene with the native Hawaiians.
The story wasn't told quite as well as I'd wished but was certainly told well enough to watch a hundred times.
I'm not going to pretend I wouldn't watch any romcom/drama with Rachel McAdams. I would and intend to.
I won't pretend I don't find Emma Stone to be a stunning delight. She is.

" Tragic Waste of Talent
",-0.4588,-0.8612,2019-07-22 00:00:00,2,"My mind was open to this film; I had no idea what to expect as, I had not read any reviews or heard anything about it.
Right away it seemed to be disjointed and confusing. Plots are all over the place. Camera work was often overly dramatic and plain bad. None of the characters were interesting. Emma Stone as an over-caffeinated part-Hawaiian space nerd F-22 pilot is the worst casting since Mickey Rooney as an Asian in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
With a cast this impressive set in a gorgeous setting one would think 'blockbuster' but this movie is an awful waste of talent.
One reviewer said it was as if the director had a story in his head and only told part of it. Exactly right. This is an example of a Director's disaster. I'd love to sit down with Bradley Cooper to hear how badly this was botched.
Warning: watch this only if you have nearly two hours to see how good actors can be made completely uninteresting."
" Doesn't hand it to you on a plate
",-0.3875,0.993,2019-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I had pretty low expectations of this film considering the user reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I fell for this film. It's a beautiful little snapshot in time with a great cast and nuanced direction/acting. Nothing is handed to you or made too obvious, but it gently follows conventions of a romcom dramedy at the same time, making the little twists and turns pleasurable to tease out. There a multiple threads in this film that tie in nicely. The story centres around Gilchrist returning to the Hawaii base and the audience gets to see each character resolve their own issues as a result of his return. The film is as much about them as it is about him, which made this a dynamic, enjoyable film. Good Sunday afternoon watch."
" Complex, funny, emotional lost love story with an environmental twist plays well.
",0.8591,0.9651,2019-07-06 00:00:00,8,"1st watched 6/6/2015
Complex, funny, emotional lost love story with an environmental twist plays well. Bradley Cooper plays a contractor getting a gig in Hawaii where he has many connections including an ex-love interest played by Rachel McAdams. He is assigned a tag-along in the project in an Air Force pilot played by Emma Stone(bringing along her usual charm). The project involves getting the blessing from local folk to build on some land for what will be a blossoming contract company for the military. The gig seems like a normal formed alliance with the Hawaiian people, but gets very complex when it's assumed the military has plans that will not make them happy(satellites in orbit with possible weapon deployment in the air). The romantic triangle is the centerpiece but there is so much more here done by writer/director Cameron Crowe in this carefully constructed tale. The storyline definetly doesn't sound like a blockbuster, but the talent involved here brings this piece up another level. A good job by all involved."
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.974,2019-06-27 00:00:00,4,"I think Aloha's quagmire of a plot had been addressed sufficiently, so I will focus on the acting portion of the film.Bradley Cooper put in a completely uninspired, if not, at times, a strangely laughable performance. His blank stares and sheepish smiles, his monotonous delivery and, oh god, his half-assed attempt at being angry were a pain to watch. He seemed like a substitute actor who had no interest in partaking in the film, but somehow ended up as the main character.Emma Stone was mediocre. But, to her credit, at least she was lively and invested in her character. Still, I don't think she was the right actress for this role. She came off a bit too cartooney - is that a word? - and melodramatic in some scenes. Great actress, wrong casting.Now there are a few actors who have absolutely no business being in this film. Literally, the only reason why Bill Murray, Alec Baldwin, and John Krasinski are in this film is because they're established names in Hollywood. Other than that, however, their roles could have been filled by some Craigslist actors and it would not have made one bit of a difference to the final product, because that's how insignificant their characters were to the film. Oh, and John Krasinski and Bradley Cooper's non-verbal heart-to-heart moment was just downright bizarre, or bizarrely hilarious - the whole movie seems this way, actually.The only saving grace, I thought, was Rachel McAdams's performance, which was wonderfully executed, and surprisingly authentic. In short, she seemed like she cared - not just about her character, but also about the movie - though, in vain, I'm afraid.Don't waste your time watching Aloha, unless you have a major celeb crush on Emma Stone or Rachel McAdams, or both."

Great acted, beautiful shot, great visuals, Amazing cast and great scenes. I loved it! It suprised me some places even. At some places it did feel a little rushed though, true.. But don't let that ruin it for you. Great movie I think.. And wauw.. That hula dance is just beautiful... There really are some beautiful moments in here (some also felt a little too much maybe, but damn.. I sucked it right up)Don't listen to all the bad reviews. It cracked me up a lot of times too, it's funny. And again.. Just some beautiful scenes and beautifully shot all the way through :)"

",0.6486,0.9838,2019-06-22 00:00:00,7,"At first glance, you can see this isn't one of the top quality movies out there. It is a obvious romantic drama, and those types of movies are very rarely rated good so if you are a person who loves all those cheesy feel good movies - then this is one of them.
Maybe in some ways this movie is a bit messy, but it still had a clear red line throughout and a nice plot. Also the actors are doing their job well and I did not cringe the least once.I enjoyed it. I even had to go 10 seconds back a few times just to relive the cute moments, but that is me. I am also one who watches the more serious movies by Spielberg, Scorsese, Fincher etc.
My point is that this is a movie worth giving a chance, you may not like it or you may end up enjoying it on a late night by yourself to have something to smile about.I was left with a good and warm feeling in my chest after ."

This flick needs to be watched more than once. When I first watched it I did not like it, and didn't know what to make of Emma Stone's character as she seemed to be overacting at first, but as I rewatched this throughout the years I realised that this is just how her character is supposed to be.The Hawaiian false gods aspect is foolishness. As a Christian I don't believe in that, and I heard that Hawaii actually has a massive Christian population/community, had Director Cameron Crowe gone that route spiritually with this film I believe it would be a better movie.Aloha - A movie about relationships. We follow Bradley Cooper's character in his work life and personal life. Great performances from all the cast. Rachel McAdams is very good in her role.Aloha - Not a brilliant movie, but watchable."

It was definitely not what I believe a comedy would be, too gloomy, too sad, too many personal problem issues.I found the movie a drag and downer from beginning to end. And I am sorry, I do not think Cooper's character would be a good match for the heroine Emma Stone. His character was not enchanting or attractive at all.And Bill Murray was a big disappointment in the film. Not really a good match for him at all.And, frankly, I get so tired of the obligatory sex scenes! They are tiresome and ruin almost any picture when they just throw it in to show attraction.But still the one who classified this as a ""comedy"" needs to redefine his/her criteria."

I tried to see what other film I had seen him in and couldn't find it until I went to write this review and realized from the rating I had seen it before.Bill Murray should not have been allowed to dress himself for this production. Others seemed miscast but maybe that is what the dnrector sought. I was not convinced this was real situation.As for Emma Stone being 1/4 Hawaiian I liked one other reviewer's take that she just wanted to have native ancestory. If it was supposed to be real then after casting realizing her heritage was not going to wash they could have had her adopted.And I did not get that the girl would be happy about that klutz being her father.

It's funny has a great cast and what's good is it's just different. I can't properly verbalise but the way it's made is interesting and holds your attention more than a standard movie. Definitely worth the watch! There are plenty of little sub plots at play too.

I really liked the movie and the characters in it, but I understand why some people see faults in it.
The movie has several different things going one, and it get's a little messy. Some things are maybe not explained or introduced thorough enough, which is why I think this movie actually could have benefitted from being a little bit been longer. I would have liked to understand more of the background to Gilcrests relations with the native Hawaiians. Also, what goes on in the base and with the satelite stuff was a bit unclear for a longer period. And Ng's relationship to it, and why she felt the way she did was unclear to me. I got the feeling that the movie is nearly there, and could really have been a great movie with some minor alterations. But it's watchable due to the great actors alone."
" A Superior, Quality Romance Comedy
",0.8625,0.9936,2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"9 June 2015. Cameron Crowe has incorporated a fresh twisting mystery concept into this comedic quartet (especially when one counts the silent husband). This is a high end conceptual comedy movie that doesn't really on one-liners nor physical gags, but one intelligent, ordinary humor and witty dialogue. There is a tribute and respect for native culture and insightful respect for blended families. This timing is snappy and the acting seems smoothly part of the Hawaiian setting. The whole movie is naturally presented along with some refreshing camera work.The delicate interplay of two relationships, the incorporation of corporate dealings and the contemporary use of the current state of America's space program make for a tight and nicely done comedy about people and politics and loyalty. There are elements of mystery as found in Space Cowboys (2000) along with the comical dynamic duo relational in Morning Glory (2010) and the culture immersion of the Whale Rider (2002) along with the comedic tone of assassin comedy movie The Matador (2005)."
" Incredibly bad - easily Cameron Crowe's worst film
",-0.7363,0.9965,2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"A former US Air Force officer, Brian Gilchrist, returns to Hawaii as a civilian contractor. He now works for a private space company, owned by multi-billionaire Carson Welch. This return is a homecoming of sorts but is bitter-sweet: his best friend is now married to his ex-girlfriend and he still holds a torch for her. Then there's Allison Ng, the beautiful Air Force captain tasked with watching over him.Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this is easily his worst film. Crowe made some great films - Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky - as well as writing the excellent Fast Times at Ridgemont High. However, his output after Vanilla Sky - 'Elizabethtown' and 'We Bought A Zoo' - was less impressive. Not bad, just not great and not in the same league as the aforementioned movies.Aloha confirms that his output trajectory is definitely downwards.Aloha is incredibly bad: a half-baked romance mixed in with a nonsensical, farcical examination of the ethics of weapons in space and civilian space companies, with a bit of Hawaiian culture thrown in to please the politically correct crowd. Nothing ever feels plausible or is even interesting. The movie just rumbles along, with random divergences and a cliched central plot.Great cast - Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, Bill Murray, Alec Baldwin, John Krasinski, Danny McBride - but even they feel like they're phoning it in. Stone overdoes the intensity initially, though gets better as the movie goes on.Proof that Cameron Crowe has run out of ideas."

Storylines make no sense, have illogical or no conclusion, or make leaps to a completely different place. It's about the military, but it's like it was written by someone who has only seen the military from a distance. Same with computers...and Hawaii...and Hawaiians...and women...and planes.....The number of big names attached to this is astounding, and I imagine all of them got nice paychecks out of it. Too bad they can't be proud of it."

Whether is rom-com, horror, thriller, drama or whatever, and aloha give me that, especially at the end of the movie when Carson Welch get arrested after a long conversation between Gilcrest and General Dixon and Fingers, and also give me a big smile while Brian Gilcrest kissed Allison Ng and that the hat is still there.

Brian is assigned a military escort, Captain Ng (Emma Stone) as we already know not ""if"" but ""when"" in spite of his instant dislike of her.The film is primarily a romantic comedy, but includes enough wheeling/dealing and spy stuff to cloud the romance.

There were a lot of random ideas and plot points thrown around which didn't really contribute to the main plot line at all, and were not revisited or expanded upon. The movie overall was a rather bland and even boring tale, which could have ended in around 20 minutes if not for the unrelated plot points. Not sure why it's classified as a 'rom-com' as there was nothing remotely comedic about the movie, and it wasn't much of a love story.

A final scene and some sublimely beautiful acting, minus dialogue, from young Danielle Rose Russell. The feeling she conveys in that speechless scene for me is worth the entire films journey.

Her final scene was eminently touching. The only problem is, I couldn't figure out how she knew the truth. At least her ""father"" had some math clues to help him figure it out.I had some trouble with Emma Stone in the beginning. I really could not tell if she had genuine hero worship, or if she was laughing at Gilcrest the whole time. Later in the movie her emotions rang true.There were a couple of very sweet romantic plots in this film. The relationship between Woody and Tracy was a great story with good acting but slightly quirky elements The relationship of Gilcrest and Ng was more traditional with the sequence of - friction in the beginning, then fall in love, then have a falling out, then ... well you can guess.At least some of the subplots were necessary to advance the romantic interests, but there were just way too many subplots."

It's sort of simpleminded, feel-good, lightweight fare for progressive minded people.That's what you have here, along with beautiful Hawaiian settings.Major spoilers ahead.The two emotional climaxes of the movie really bothered me upon reflection. The first is when two men, rivals, have a bro conversation without saying a word. It is subtitled -yuk yuk. At first it seems clever, but then it really began to bother me after the movie was over. This is some kind of male fantasy that it is possible to have meaningful communication with people you are ""intimate"" with without having to do the hard work of formulating words and listening . Nonsense. The final emotional scene is of a 13-year-old girl discovering her father is not her father, that the Cooper character is. She gets teary- eyed, runs out of dance class, and hugs him. Guys, I was a 13-year-old girl and knew many. This is not how we behave! Thrown crockery, slammed doors, screaming ""I hate you!"" is more like it. Running away, sleeping with a bad boy, shooting up the garage, cutting wrists? All are more likely. But it's a feel-good movie, so realism be damned.Thus, the two moments that are supposed to warm our hearts fail for me . However I'm rating it higher then I might otherwise because of the ludicrous controversy. Remember when Christians stood outside that movie about Jesus protesting without knowing a thing about it or having ever having seen it? Yeah, well, this is what happened here. How reassuring to know that people on all sides of the political/cultural spectrum can be total idiots, getting huffy about the very content that panders to them."

I watched this movie, knowing from the beginning, that it had an all star cast, and I admit, some of my favorite actors, and in my opinion, they all gave great performances! Kudos to the casting director! The little girl, Danielle Rose Russell (Grace), had one of the most emotional, heart wrenching, non speaking scenes, in the entire movie! She and Bradley Cooper killed it! I cried, and still do cry, every time that scene comes on. Very emotional, and highly believable.When I watch a movie, it isn't so much the witty dialogue, or over the top action sequences, that draw me in, it is the expressions, and non verbal communication, between the movies characters/actors! I have to be able to relate in some way, to the circumstance or situation. The story has to be believable! This movie was loaded, with tons of non verbal communication, and I loved it! Cameron Crowe hit it out of the ball park with this one! I love Cameron Crowe's movies! He has away of writing and directing, that suits my sensibilities, and exposes the raw human condition! Add a story line, that is highly believable, filmed in a beautiful location, along with the mesmerizing chemistry, between Bradley Cooper, (Brian Gilcrest), Rachel McAdams(Tracy Woodside), Emma Stone(Alision Ng), Bill Murray(Carson Welch), and John Krasinski(John ""Woody"" Woodside) and every one of the remaining co-stars, it all added up for me, to be an wholesomely entertaining, emotionally charged, heartfelt drama, with a dash of quirky humor, thrown in for good measure! Also, I love the fact, there was zero gratuitous nudity, sexual exploitation, or foul language! Mega points and respect from me, for not going after the low hanging fruit! Believe it or not, not one f bomb was uttered, during the entire movie! That has to be some kind of record, and worthy of some recognition!

In fact, the entire cast is excellent.The action does take place in Hawaii, but I don't want to say much about the plot, because it is full of surprises that should not be spoiled. I will say that it celebrates island culture."
