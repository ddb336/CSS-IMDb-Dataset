" Awesome Movie, classic cop movie modern style
",0.6249,0.9413,2020-12-15 00:00:00,9,"Had never heard of McDonagh before this movie but once you've watched it, you know there's serious talent at work. The interplay between Pena and Skarsgard made this movie. I cannot imagine it with Hedlund in the role, it would have killed the vibe. Pena and Skarsgard have effortless chemistry a d it sells the whole movie. Last time I saw this match level was pulp fiction with Jackson and travolta. The Villian and the henchman were played perfectly by Theo James and Caleb Landry Jones, once again the perfect duo for these parts. Although the plot skips around it's easy to follow and every scene adds something to the story. It's a multiple watch movie, destined to be a classic."
" War on the audience
",-0.5994,0.9451,2020-06-04 00:00:00,1,"Who the hell likes this? Who the hell made it? This was so terrible I only made it about 5 minutes in. The ""comedy"" was terrible! I am a fan of black comedy but what? I have a feeling this movie was made to be serious and they realized it was so bad the they tried to turn it into a comedy.I really like Michael Pena and was glad to see him staring in something. But his talent was wasted.If you found yourself laughing at this I think you need to rush to your nearest therapist. Wanna see a black comedy? Watch American Psycho or Fight Club or Fargo or Harold and Maude or something! Anything but this. For the love of everything that humans have evolved into not this!A side note: 5 production credits at the start? That's gotta be a record right?"
" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9728,2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"I like this movie better than I thought I would. My husband watched it first and liked it, but did not think that it would be the movie for me, because it is very violent. I tend to not like violent movies.Alexander Skarsgård is one of my favorite actors, so I decided to give it a try. He is shirtless and sexy for quite a few scenes, so the movie already gets a few stars just because of that.He and Michael Peña play well off of each other. They have a lot of witty back-and-forth banter that I enjoyed watching. The movie is full of memorable one-liners.The soundtrack is great and so is the scenery. The cinematography is excellent.All in all, this movie kept me entertained , and was a decent way to spend an hour and a half."
" Hilarious
",0.4019,0.7278,2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"How does this only have a 5.8? This movie cracked me up and kept me until the very end. Skarsgard and Pena blew me away with their acting. Good music. Story is constant. The supporting roles are fantastic. Some dark humor, but isn't that the point?"
" No.
",-0.296,-0.2247,2020-05-15 00:00:00,2,"Seriously, watching all these crap movies. Maybe I should start writing again. Let's just string a whole bunch of eccentric characters with a crappy plot and film it. A lot say it's a dark comedy, you want to see a good dark comedy... watch Very Bad Things not that's a dark comedy. What happened to all the creativity?"

" Excellent movie

" In a world where nobody took anything seriously...
",0.0,0.9892,2019-12-24 00:00:00,5,"This unconventional buddy cop film definitely feels as tired as the formula from which it emerges. The kicker here is that both the cops are terrible at their jobs, utterly bored throughout, and have not even an attempt at chemistry between the two of them. One is a checked out family man and the other a burnt-out drunk, both recreationally use drugs and break all kinds of laws, are only on the big case for the money (an amazingly low-stakes sum of a million dollars) and amazingly haven't both been fired as police years ago. You'd think this all would be funnier than it sounds but it's going more for a PULP FICTION style of darkly comedic irony than macho silliness a la HOT FUZZ.Considering that this comes after years of LETHAL WEAPON clones who have done most of this premise better, I'd call this film pretty forgettable if it weren't for a few elements. One is that it's shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico for obvious tax-incentive reasons because the city doesn't factor into the plot in the slightest bit. The setting does lend the film an air of uniqueness and makes good use of the geography of the city. However, it does go overboard a few times by doing things like putting a random dialog scene in the city's scenic cable car for absolutely no reason other than to show off.Two, the scene near the end in the boxing gym when the villain's henchmen drag the drunk cop before him had me in stitches. The villain obviously can't contain his disgust for the hero or how cliche'd his roughing up is going to go, so he doesn't even look at or engage with him at all. One of the henchmen asks the boss what to do and he just starts hitting the bag. The confused henchmen then beat up the cop while their leader just acts out an OCD episode on his punching bag. I absolutely love this scene because every character in it seems to be in a different movie and nobody succeeds with communicating anything to anyone, while simultaneously it tells us a lot about their characters and emotions. Granted, a lot of this was created in the editing room but hats off to the editor and director on taking several risks and succeeding. This scene nearly singlehandedly saves the film.Overall while this film suffers from a lack of enthusiasm and creativity, it manages to showcase some amusing character moments and a few bold choices. Worthy viewing on a slow-going Sunday afternoon once you've finished other movies about anti-heroes who aren't taking anything around themselves seriously. THE BIG LEBOWSKI and EVOLUTION also spring to mind."
" corny and lovable and the same time
",0.6124,0.7506,2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,"John Michael McDonagh's ""War on Everyone"" is a corny movie, but also one that you just gotta love. This look at a pair of corrupt cops who get more than they bargained for brings up the issue of police brutality but also has the viewer laughing every step of the way. And besides, how often do we get to see New Mexico on screen?I recommend it."
" Really bad action, nothing special
",-0.7228,-0.939,2019-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Just bad action movie, not worth the time. Two shallow bad cops with no story to tell or an idea to share. Waste of time and money. I don't recommend it whatsoever, unfortunate series of events"
" A rare find.
",0.0,-0.347,2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"I watch a lot of movies. I have seen virtually every decent movie since 1960. I own most of them. that said, it seems harder and harder to find a movie these days, due to the massive influx of indies and PC junk. I would never give this a 10 based on one genre. It was the whole package that earned it. Comedy, Action, Crime, Retro References, Bad Romance, Horror/Gore. You name it. It had it. It also kept you wondering WTF was going on in half the movie. the only thing that isn't right about the movie is the title. If you start watching this with the idea it's a comedy, you will like it."
" Thoroughly enjoyable experience
",0.4927,0.4672,2019-08-10 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled upon this film by accident and it proved to be a very enjoyable two-hour accident :-). The film is a 'Dirty Harry meets Starsky and Hutch meets Lethal Weapon' - experience. Lots of action, crooked cops that go their own way, an angry chief that constantly threatens to suspend and sack them, nasty villains (who will all be shot of course) and loads of (slightly wrong but great) humour.
The film could have done with some editing, because the storyline is flawed on a few occasions, but not too much. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the ride and don't take it too seriously. Be glad that these kind of films are (still) being made in America."
" Awful, Terrible, Pointless Drivel
",-0.7269,-0.555,2019-07-26 00:00:00,1,"If I could give this boring, worthless film a negative star rating it would be negative 10! I had to turn this movie off because while yes there was most likely a script these ""actors"" read from, there most certainly wasn't any plot though! Long gone are the days of edgy Tarention type stories. This movie is at ""war"" with itself trying to be something it's not and that's called being entertaining. I got a bootleg download if this movie and it's not my downloading it that should be considered a crime but rather that I can't report them for making such a terrible movie. Ramble on Michael Pena, normally an enjoyable actor but this movie denies him any ability to succeed here. Trying to be witty and fresh are reasons why this movie fails. Clearly the writer never learned that day one lesson in high school, you can't try to be a cool kid you just are, this movie is one of the kids standing in the back of class awkwardly and will never get asked to prom! Crap!"
" Worse than I expected.
",-0.4767,0.5267,2019-01-07 00:00:00,6,"Alexander Skarsgård and Theo James performed fairly decent, but Michael Peña seemed bored and too monotonic in his role. Interesting story, but weirdly played out. Directing and cinematography was decent. IMO, this film failed to deliver with such a great cast. 6/10 from me."
" Utter rubbish
",0.0,-0.9194,2018-10-02 00:00:00,1,"British movies are often pretty good quality, movies such as Bait, Calibre etc but this movie sadly wasn't British, British funded I hear although I've no idea why. It's a dreadful movie, I got 2/3 of the way through and simply switched off it was that bad. I cannot say anymore"
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.7865,2018-08-21 00:00:00,4,This is not terrible. It's just that I'd expected so much more from talented writer-director John Michael McDonagh. His third feature film seems to lack all of the ingenuity and writing skills that impressed so greatly in his previous works.
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.7269,2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,Didn't even make it 30 minutes into this stupid movie before shutting it off. Really disappointed in Michael Pena cause he usually stars in really great roles. The characters were poor and the story was slow moving.
" An Audacious Black Comedy About Buddy Cops
",0.5267,0.2398,2018-06-30 00:00:00,7,"""Calvary"" writer & director John Michael McDonagh's ""War on Everyone"" is a quirky, Tarantinoesque, crime thriller about a couple of Albuquerque, New Mexico, police detectives whose broad interpretation of the law keeps their superiors on their backs. The buddy-buddy relationship between Terry Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård of ""Straw Dogs"") and Bob Bolaño (Michael Peña of ""Chips"") echoes the likes of Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Our protagonists are subversive in every sense of the word, and director John Michael McDonagh has a blast skewering the clichés of the genre. Wow do these cops do whatever that pleases them. Skarsgård and Peña aren't Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but they have some charismatic moments in this off-kilter law & order epic. Monroe is almost off the rails. He is clearly an alcoholic and his idea of parking is ramming another parked card. Bolaño has a wife and two little boys. The little things-the nuances-in McDonagh screenplay provide some insight into the characters. Monroe craves the music of Glenn Campbell. Bolaño loves to complicate everything with philosophical questions. These cops aren't afraid to charge into any predicament and damn the torpedoes full speed ahead. Their long-suffering superior, Lieutenant Gerry Stanton (Paul Reiser of ""Beverly Hills Cop""), takes a load of crap from them. Predictably, because ""War on Everyone"" coasts on clichés during its awkward spots, the two detectives are asked to hand in their badges. The villain drool fiendishly for the opportunity to take them down, but they get the surprise of their lives. You know a movie is definitely weird when it opens with two suit & tie detectives pursuing a mime. They smash in him and appropriate what he was carrying. ""Does a mime make a sound when you hit him,"" Bolaño asks his friend before they ram him and send his body tumbling up their hood, over the roof, and down to the asphalt behind them. Unfortunately, McDonagh cannot maintain those maniac moments when our heroes are at the top of their game. Theo James makes a formidable villain with British aristocracy in his background, and his right-hand man, Russell Birdwell (Caleb Landry Jones of ""American Made""), makes a truly despicable villain who like to flaunt a straight-razor. The venerable bulletproof jacket scene is so lame, too. ""War on Everyone"" is an indie-themed film that fearlessly rushes in where mainstream films fear to go."
" Weird movie.
",-0.1779,-0.4767,2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,"This is a weird one. Timing is weird. Characters are weird. Lines are quotable. ""What chair?""*thumbs up*"
" Insane Unexpected Gem
",-0.4019,0.9672,2018-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Ridiculously funny movie. Banter and comedic timing on point. I thought I was going to watch a throw away (because I had never heard of it), but I enjoyed the cast in their other work so I thought it must be worth a try.ASDFASDFQW - Out of nowhere, and immediately, the movie has unrelenting comedic moments. I haven't seen Skarsgard in a comedic role previously but he nailed it. I saw Pena in CHIPS and knew he'd be funny but together they killed it the way Dax and he did. Very different movie with dark comedy but definitely worth the watch."
" Dark material executed glibly
",0.0,0.024,2018-04-21 00:00:00,4,"The lead actors delivered very cavalier, and at times self-satisfied performances of material that begged to be delivered with a dry and dark British sensibility (and in the interest of fairness I thought Theo James was bas too. Totally miscast as the tough baddie). Getting the performances he needed from his stars was the Writer/Director John Michael McDonough's job, so he shoulders the blame for this poor movie right alongside it's stars Michael Pena and Alexander Skarsgard. It's a shame too, because the elements were there on paper and to be honest, the films not poorly written or shot (Though some of the humor crossed the line into bad taste).The one bright spot in this movie was Caleb Landry Jones, who delivered a really fun performance as a foppish strip club owner (I believe) who I think was connected to Theo James' bad guy.So unless you're a John Michael McDonough fan I think this is a film you can skip."
" Perfectly bad and good
",0.5574,-0.9631,2018-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This film was great. The first ten minutes were a bit rude and outrageous and was expecting it to go down like Sin City. But no, the women add philosophy and hilarity and from there it's an hilarious brutal ride. The acting is not psychopathic at all like Sin City. The acting is sensitive and real. This film is more like Bad Lieutenant, an hellish ride with crazy-braves and sillyness. Bravo! Encore!"
" Quite random...and hilarious
",0.4549,0.872,2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Bob Bolano and Terry Monroe are two crooked Albuquerque PD detectives. They tend to hustle criminals but their methods have landed them in hot water with their boss, and they are on their last warning. They get wind of a heist and decide to muscle in on the action, robbing the perpetrators. Unfortunately for them, the mastermind of the heist is someone out of their league, someone they would do well to fear.Hilariously funny in an offbeat, anarchic, sort of way. Plot is fairly random and, if you viewed the movie as a drama, not entirely watertight. But then, who would watch this as a drama? Great script and dialogue that is part-Tarantino, part-Big Lebowski. Throw in some spot-on performances from Michael Pena and Alexander Skarsgard, a director that seems to have a short concentration span and you have a wildly funny roller-coaster of a movie.As an added bonus, more than enough to offend the average SJW (not that this takes much)."
" A real comedic misfire
",0.4019,0.9259,2017-09-12 00:00:00,2,"Back in 2014, U.K based director John Michael McDonagh gave us Calvary.A follow-up to his well-regarded, if little seen dark comedy The Guard, Calvary saw McDonagh reteaming with his leading man Brendan Gleeson to deliver a refreshingly unique and utterly captivating experience that had many justifiably excited for what the promising director would dish up next.Taking his time before treating us to his next feature length experience, it's with great disappointment that McDonagh's Calvary follow-up is War on Everyone, a film that wants you to desperately like its politically incorrect and unashamedly seedy ""comedic"" look at Michael Pena's and Alexander Skarsgard's loose unit police officers Bob Balano and Terry Monroe as they traverse a barely their story of criminals and corrupt cops, filled with Glen Campbell classics, sprinklings of hard-core violence and a script that wishes it was written by Quintin Tarantino.Both The Guard and Calvary found a great balance between dramatic ticks, storyline and comedic moments (most darkly morbid and totally politically incorrect) but War on Everyone never once nails it's convoluted components and it really feels as though McDonagh is clutching at straws in his first Hollywood picture, rather than walking his own beat like he did with his impressive one-two debut films.There are moments within the film where characters ramble about the importance of scripts in films and how they're the making or breaking of what makes a great film so it's clear McDonagh knows the importance of a good script (although he is responsible for writing the 2003 misfire Ned Kelly) and it's something we know his capable of but the failings of War on Everyone are never more evident in how experienced and well regarded actors like Pena and Skarsgard deliver their lines without energy or life as they meander about McDonagh's shady story.Both these characters are neither likable, nor are they interesting enough to make us dislike them, they're just not appealing in general. Perhaps had the film included a story with any form of mystery or villains that steal the show we might've cared more but trying to enliven the film with misguided romantic sub-plots or bizarrely towards the end of proceedings a child exploitation plot device, McDonagh doesn't seem comfortable in his world, a facet that was certainly not the case in his early works.Final Say – If you've ever thought that the idea of two deadbeat cops running down a mime in their patrol car, taking drugs with informants or talking about cinematic auteur Steven Soderbergh is the stuff of movie magic then the War on Everyone might just be your new favourite comedy but for the rest of us, McDonagh's extremely disappointing and criminally unfunny film is cause for concern for a filmmaker that has the talent to be anything, both great or bad.1 Icelandic getaway out of 5"
" Surprised!
",0.2942,0.9738,2017-09-10 00:00:00,8,"This was way more than I expected, and it was the cap to a really good day. I was flying back to the US from Switzerland, and I had snagged a first class seat with United being a standby guy. After a great four-course meal and some lovely drinks, I decided it was time to watch a movie. I look through everything, and I don't see much. But, then, I find this movie. I like Pena, and I figured right away that it was Stellan's kid starring along with him. Skarsgard isn't a popular name. So, I put it on. Within about a minute, I knew I was going to like it.It was certainly all over the place (in a good way), and I would never have guessed they would go to Iceland, but, hey, go figure. The entire throwback nature of the film and soundtrack was just what I was looking for. Glen Campbell's music along with some other interesting choices was right up my allay. Sadly, Glen died about a week after I got back in town. It was fun to see Iceland. As someone who just went there, too, it was fun to see that they were really there. The movie did suffer a tiny bit at the end I thought, but, overall, it was a freaking fun movie that I recommend to anyone with a twisted, off-the-wall sense of humor."
" Terrible Mess
",-0.6808,-0.8074,2017-09-04 00:00:00,1,"Terrible Mess of a movie. I have no idea what's going on. There's no plot. The screenplay is in bits and pieces. The only saving grace is Alexander Skarsgaard.Apart from that , the movie has no humour, no drama, no nothing, Just a bunch of people talking crap and shooting at each other.1/10 maybe 1.5/10 for the cute Alexander Skarsgaard."
" Rare Comedic Masterpiece
",0.7783,0.9704,2017-08-24 00:00:00,10,"So few comedies have the courage to go all out. Of course, when you go all out you transcend any genre, like Cronenberg's ""Crash"". So refreshing. Thank you. It is rare to watch a film that doesn't apologize for itself. Please make many more. To meet IMDb guidelines I have to right more. This reminds me of ""Freebie and the Bean"" and ""Best in Show"".

" 100% worth the watch
",0.2263,0.9655,2017-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Choosing a number rating for this film was not easy, because it is not much like any other film I've seen.Most of it kept me thoroughly entertained. The dialogue is hilariously absurd, and I never really knew what to expect lurking around the next corner. Despite being ultra- violent, it never really feels like that dark of a film. Honestly I'm not sure that I consider it to be a dark comedy, it's in an arena of its own.To see Skarsgård play in a buddy cop duo is definitely something out of the ordinary, and I'm not sure that I'm entirely convinced that the characters gel that well together. However, it is not an ordinary buddy cop film, and the characters are funny enough (and greatly portrayed by Pena and Skarsgård) that it never really bothered me.If you're looking for a run of the mill, easily digested action/comedy flick, this might not be for you. I thoroughly recommend that everybody watch it regardless."
" Brilliant black comedy
",0.743,0.9217,2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"War on Everyone is a dialogue driven movie, character developments are secondary and the plot is almost besides the point. The movie is akin to an annotated prose poetry book, with explanatory notes for some of the more ambiguous lines within the book itself. Viewers would enjoying second and third viewings where plenty of references embedded in the movie, some to itself, will emerge. The movie is in the buddy cop comedy genre. This is a crowded genre and the movie wastes no time delving on the obvious. In fact most of the clichés are assumed and the movie proceeds beyond the cliché. Therefore, those viewers less familiar with buddy copy clichés, might feel a discontinuity in the movie, whereas more experienced movie goers will find the story seamless and funny. It is also difficult to tell if one is reading too much into the script and one's interpretation is co-incidental or not. For examples, some of the characters find themselves in Iceland after indulging in some unlawful activity. Is the movie making a socio-political statement about Iceland's liberal policies? Perhaps, and that is the great thing about the script, it raises more questions than it answers. In fact the movie itself mentions this very point, so the writing is self-aware. If you are looking for an intelligent movie with smart dialogue then you will enjoy watching this movie."

I found it to be a little disjointed at times with no real flow to it. I thought that the actors worked well together and Tess Thompson was lovely as ever. I just felt like something was missing. My initial comparison was to the cult classic ""Pulp Fiction"", but movies like that don't come around too often. If you truly enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"", you will likely get some enjoyment from this movie. If you did not, then don't bother watching it because it is not nearly as good as PF.I gave it a ""5"" because it did make me chuckle a couple of times (and Tessa was lovely)."
" Quirky Cops
",0.0,0.958,2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,"It seems that everyone who's ever seen a movie made by Quentin Tarantino has wanted to make their own crime film filled with quirky characters and strange situations. Most of them don't work. Love him or hate him Tarantino has a certain way of making a movie that makes those things work. But on rare occasion a movie comes along that sort of feels like something he did, not quite but close, and works in spite of itself. WAR ON EVERYONE is one of those kind of movies.Bob Bolano (Michael Pena) and Terry Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard) are two definitely quirky cops. Corrupt but with an inclination to go after criminals the pair are just back on duty and warned on day one not to use excessive force or take bribes. Of course they agree and then rush out to do just that.Before heading into the office that morning they had gotten a lead they followed that had them surveilling two low level thugs known for armed robbery. Following yet another lead they discover that another known criminal has been hired to be a driver for a heist soon to go down. When they follow up with him they find his wife has stabbed him and his son has run off.It seems that each lead provides them with more information as well as giving them the opportunity to encounter a number of people. There is the strip club owner who works for the brains behind the heist, a stripper who once dated one of the men in the group, an Irishman who continuously mouths off to them and the brains himself eventually. Along the way Terry continues to drink and Bob continues to tout off facts no matter what the discussion is about.Eventually the ex-stripper moves in with Terry as does the young runaway boy. It seems that while he might spend most of his time drunk Terry does indeed have a heart of gold. So does Bob in his own way, married to a woman who understands his ways and loves him deeply and passing on his love begrudgingly to his two sons. And while they may be corrupt they're not killers. All that may change.As the case leads them closer to Lord James Mangan (Theo James), the brains behind the heist, things begin to get rough. Cars are blown up, Terry is beaten to within an inch of his life and threats are made. Retaliations lead to the pair losing the jobs as police detectives and with nothing to lose a final showdown is in the making.What for all intents and purposes could have been a terrible movie I found this one possessing enough fun to offset the rest of the shortcomings the movie has. Off kilter humor is the biggest plus this film has going for it. I mean when a movie opens up with the two cops driving down an alley towards a mime carrying two bags of drugs and one says to the other ""I always wondered if you hit a mime if he would make a sound?"" and they then find out? My twisted sense of humor kicks in and immediately I find myself rooting for the good/bad guys.None of this would matter if you had two incapable stars in the lead roles. The fact that these two seem to work well together and are filled with their characters makes them something to see. Pena in particular shines as Bob. His responsive quips and swipes at historical facts and tidbits of knowledge at the most random of times are timed to perfection and comedy is all about timing. Skarsgard's Terry is a troubled soul who loves his partner and finds more than he bargained for with the people he brings into his life, all in a good way.The production values here are top notch from lighting to cinematography to directing. The writing may not be quite up to Tarantino standards but it comes close. Even scenes that take place in Iceland (yes I said Iceland, don't ask why or how they got there) are well done and interesting.When I first started watching this I wasn't sure I'd like it. Something about it said it wasn't going to live up to my expectations. Perhaps because I set the bar low they far exceeded those. My guess is if you watch with no expectations at all except to know that the movie is a bit off the wall you'll be pleasantly surprised. I know I was and may even end up watching this a second time."
" A 70's detective black comedy trainwreck mess
",0.0,-0.9601,2017-06-05 00:00:00,3,"If you have enjoyed good 70's detective homages such as The Other Guys and Jackie Brown, then it is very disappointing to see a director completely ruin a potential new hit and cult movie here.You can tell how disjointed and badly edited this movie is by the soundtrack, which tries multiple times to 'get us in the vibe' with cheesy 1970's cop show licks, only for the music to die an agonizing death as nothing at all happens during it. We are left watching endless boring stretches of film that should have been cut (the seemingly 5 minutes long part of the main gangster walking from his bedroom downstairs is one)The two main characters, one a self-absorbed prick who likes to lounge in his silk kimono and make fun of his fat son, and the other, a total alcoholic loser who likes hitting on strippers, are NOT funny. NOT at all. The fall-flat jokes come at us a mile a minute, and the movie tries to see-saw between shocking black comedy and yuk yuk make fun of it comedy and oh so serious cop drama. It's a total mess and not worth your time, frankly."
" A really bad dark comedy that missed the mark completely for me.
",-0.4989,0.5405,2017-06-04 00:00:00,2,"I had heard about this film a while back and I have now gotten around to seeing it and I got to be honest this film is really bad. The premise of this film sees a couple of corrupt cops attempt to get the best out of there job while a criminal attempts to take them down. Now the best thing in this film is pretty easy to see, that is Michael pena and his performance, even though far from his best he tries his best to give a decent performance with a few fun laughs. Alexander skaarsgard plays his partner in this film and he is truly awful in this film, he is so unlikeable that you really don't care about him or anything that he does in this film. The supporting cast is completely forgettable whether it is Theo James as the villain or Tessa Thompson as a love interest or anybody else none of them stand out or give any performance that you care about. The story is all over the place and really doesn't create one likable character in this scenario or one story beat where you will care about anybody or anything in this film. The script I will admit does have some funny lines in it and I did chuckle sometimes. But it is not enough and any of the dramatic dialogue is ridiculously bland. The style of the film is awful, I get that these lead characters are not really meant to be good people but there is nothing here that gives you any reason you no reason to care about in the action scenes. Overall I hate this film and I believe that it should be avoided at all cost unless you just like dark comedies that don't have much quality."
" War on Everyone is Close to Being Something Great but it Still Makes for an Entertaining Dark Comedy
",0.802,0.9814,2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Terry Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard) and Bob Bolano (Michael Pena) are the black sheep of their branch of the New Mexico police department. Their obviously dirty and corrupt, they snort coke on the job and say just about every racist phrase that pops into their heads. After an admittedly funny incident where they pushed their official boundaries just a tad, they return off of suspension. Their boss Lt. Gerry Stanton (Paul Reiser) is weirdly tolerant of their behaviour but he warns them that they've run out of chances. According to him, the next complaint they get filed against them, they're gone. Terry and Bob laugh this off (Terry especially seems to be paying as little attention as possible) and they file out of the office. They try to keep a low profile but a mysterious network led by Lord James Mangan (Theo James) and Russell Birdwell (Caleb Landry-Jones) reveals itself. Terry also finds a new girlfriend in Jackie Hollis (Tessa Thompson) and Bob is trying to decide his future with his wife Delores Bolano (Stephanie Sigman).War on Everyone is the newest project by John Michael McDonagh. His biggest claim to fame is another dark police comedy The Guard (its a solid/underrated movie) so I was excited to see this. The subject matter War on Everyone is pretty dark and suitably so. Terry and Bob are fighting against some pretty evil people. The problem is that the plot is so far in the background, you almost forget that there is a through line to it. I was interested in spending time on Bob and Terry's adventures but the movie meanders so much that you feel it losing focus despite the overall story still being involved somehow. Don't get me wrong, I laughed a good amount and the hijinx these guys get into tends to be the more interesting part of the movie. I still felt myself wanting a more consistent story to go along with these very exaggerated characters.The plot isn't very strong but the movie compensates by having two larger-than-life characters at the centre. Bob and Terry are you're average dirty cops if you gave them nasty drug addictions and matching god complexes. They really don't give a crap if they're actions offend anyone or if they break the rules. Beating up criminals after they're in custody is part of the job and doing cocaine and drinking on duty is their version of their daily medicine. Their language is really filthy and while I thought some of the comedic dialogue was really good, it is straight up offensive. If you're easily put off by strong language, don't watch this movie. The movie admittedly gives them a couple of decent subplots to expand their characters a bit too. I liked Terry and Bob but their personalities highlight one of the big problems with the movie. They're so obviously corrupt and they're so offensive that no one would ever let them get away with what they do. Their actions turn them into cartoons at different points in the movie and it pushed it a little past plausible deniability. This is done for the sake of comedy but I could have used a wink at the camera or something meta dialogue to compensate for the unrealistic actions of Terry and Bob.Buddy cop movies (even if they're parodies) need strong chemistry between the partners (e.g. Michael Pena's other cop movie End of Watch). The chemistry between Skarsgard and Pena is strong even if we don't get a ton of insight into how their partnership became so strong. Pena is solid but I was pretty impressed by Skarsgard. He isn't playing a pretty boy type and Terry was a big departure from what I saw him do in the past. I also thought he had strong chemistry with Tessa Thompson. I thought she was also really good and her subplot was handled well. Theo James did about as much as he could with his character, which borders on a typical cliché British villain. Caleb Landry-Jones wasn't bad but his character was pretty weird. They made some odd choices with his character that left me almost scratching my head wondering why.This movie was pretty close to becoming something special. You have 2 funny and interesting characters sharing the screen and someone who specializes in this type of movie directing the camera. But they needed to tighten things up a little more, give us a more interactive story and maybe tone down a little of the non-PC dialogue. But this is still funny and it works so I'll give it a 7/10."

But then again, these cops right here, you won't find too many of them around. It's obvious this is anything but politically correct. So if you don't like humor off the rails and off the norm, you probably should not watch this.If you on the other hand like your comedies to be crazy and all over the place, you should give this a chance. It's actually pretty funny and the two buddies on the front are doing a great job with their characters. Completely crazy and without any morality center they take whatever they like and do not care. You could argue that this makes them despicable persons, but remember this is a movie and a comedy. Don't be offended by it, it takes away all the fun you could have"

",0.879,0.984,2017-05-04 00:00:00,9,"'WAR ON EVERYONE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new action-comedy buddy cop flick from writer/director John Michael McDonagh (who also helmed the 2011 buddy cop film 'THE GUARD', and the 2014 catholic priest dramatic thriller 'CALVARY'). This one stars Michael Pena and Alexander Skarsgard as two crooked cops that constantly blackmail and frame criminals, in New Mexico, that get in over their heads when they try to mess with the wrong guy. The movie also costars Theo James, Tessa Thompson, Caleb Landry Jones, Malcolm Barrett and Paul Reiser. It got mostly positive reviews from critics (although not as positive as McDonagh's other movies) and it also screened at the Panorama section of the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. I absolutely loved it, and I think it's McDonagh's best movie to date.Detective Bob Bolano (Pena) and Detective Terry Monroe (Skarsgard) are two crooked cops that work in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Bob is a family man, with a wife and two kids, while Terry is an alcoholic bachelor. The two make a comfortable living for themselves by blackmailing known criminals in the area. They put themselves in serious danger though, when they start to harass a corrupt British 'Lord' named James Mangan (James).The movie is classic buddy action-comedy material, that can easily rival the likes of 'LETHEL WEAPON', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' or 'THE NICE GUYS'. It's darker than those other films, but somehow you still care about the two lead anti-heroes in it (and Pena and Skarsgard are both fantastic in their roles). It's quite a bit different than McDonagh's other movies; it has a lot more commercial appeal and it's begging for a franchise (I'd love to see sequels with the same lead characters). If you're a fan of extremely clever and witty dialogue, and buddy action flicks, you definitely can't go wrong with this one!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo"

I think Mr. Skaarsgard needs a little more acting lessons or experiences to be up there with his Dad, but I'm sure he'll get there. I didn't laugh out loud but found a few things extremely entertaining and the plot believable. If you want a new take on a buddy cop team, this one is for you."

There was a certain lack of satire which the film could have definitely benefited from. My biggest disappointment was Mr Skarsgard, I love his father's work and the work he did on Diary of a teenage girl, but I want to see him play more roles that do not depict him as just a 'pretty boy'. I don't know I feel he could do better. Not a bad film, honestly but the trailer over sold it. Not something I would watch a second time. I wanted a plot twist or an open ending."
" Never really comes together
",0.0,-0.8043,2017-04-17 00:00:00,4,"Let me start out by saying I'm a huge fan of John Michael McDonagh's work, especially The Guard. That being said this movie was a miss in my opinion.All the elements are there for a quirky send up of a genre movie; the strange broken characters, the thuggish cops that have their hearts in the right place, the out of place philosophical quotes etc. It's all there, but it never really gels. All the building blocks remain building blocks, the characters remain strangely stereotypical, despite trying to break most stereotypes. Their backstories are never developed and never explained, even though their erratic behaviour would do well with some sort of explanation. We're not in a small town in Ireland here, these are young, 'hip' characters that act very unlike their peers for no apparent reason. This is even voiced by Skarsgard's character when he asks Pena why he sticks with him only to receive the wholly unsatisfying answer of 'because you're a good friend of mine'. This is where camaraderie could explain away plot holes, but the chemistry just isn't there, imho largely thanks to Skarsgard*. The result is that at the end of the film you can still taste each ingredient in the final dish, instead of them blending together and forming a whole. It's as if they struck gold with The Guard and didn't want to veer too far off the beaten track. Or worse, as if some American producers saw that film and went 'we want that, but set in America'. Well you can't capture lightning in a bottle, and you especially can't capture it in America, so all the charm and humour of the original falls flat here. *Oh and I must make a special note for how bad of a choice Skarsgard was for this role. His accent is simply terrible, I actually had to look him up to see what his native language was, because he kept slipping into some strange amalgamation of an American Swedish accent. He was audibly influenced by David Wilmot's Irish accent in their scenes together, so he comes out with some odd mock-Irish twang which really takes you out of the scene. All this would have been mildly annoying if they left his origin uncertain, but he makes jokes about Europeans very clearly implying the character is meant to be from the US. In addition to his accent troubles he also clearly had trouble keeping up with Michael Pena's quick patter, which was also detrimental to the development of their on screen chemistry and my immersion as a viewer.All in all I must say this one was a miss, but I'm still looking forward to the next one."

The cops are dirty, the villains are even dirtier and the banter flows quickly from poetry to philosophy to inane jokes with just the right dose of meaty violence sprinkled in.The two main characters harmonize well together, their on-screen friendship being apparent quickly and their banter being witty as well as funny enough for a good laugh here and there. Skarsgard and Pena really rock their respective scenes and i wish there was more.The action scenes happen in a pattern, with each of them starting with the main characters being in or near a car. I also like the camera work. While the shots are not overly long, they feel right in the way they pace their particular scenes.The villains are well acted, but feel relatively two dimensional from a script angle.That having been said this movie is surely not for everyone, as is also expressed by the current 5.7 average rating. Don't expect any changes in the characters to happen throughout this movie or a big meaningful message, because there is none.This movie is just about two friends who also happen to be very good, albeit dirty, cops going to ""fuck some scumbags"" on the side and i love it for that."

Everything was unbelievably bad: the script, and the acting by all involved. Skarsgard and Pena are good actors and seem to fare better when they are not the main characters. Also there was way too much language trying to be funny. It wasn't. I just couldn't let this go on for a second longer. In most movies the worst of the worst happens within the first 15-minutes.

" Tragically Unfunny, But Could've Had Potential
",-0.3291,0.9899,2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"-No spoilers that aren't already revealed by having looked at the main page of this film concerning filming locations; or are so vague as to be harmless.-First off, the positives, and the only thing that saves this from a 1 star review:1. They did some location filming, and it visually looks pretty.For those who've been to Albuquerque, you know that's what it looks like, and you know that's the peculiar vibe of New Mexico. I'll give credit where it's due that they at least spent some money to go somewhere. And they went to Iceland.2. There are about three funny jokes. One was part of them going to Iceland. One I remember vaguely existing, but don't remember what it was about. And one ties in with the failings.Second, where they went wrong: It's not funny. That's where it fails.Reason 1: Overdoing Politics: The bits with Paul Reiser and Skarskard and Pena being crooked cops and all cops are crooked and racist and so on made the guy sitting next to me in the theater wearing the Free Mumia shirt get up and leave because he thought they were too hamfisted in beating home their politics.I count as one more positive one line/scene in the movie that's actually really, really sharp and without all the rest of that would've made biting social commentary - about the Albuquerque SWAT team arbitrarily killing a guy that the detectives were looking for. It's a nod to the city's SWAT team killing a homeless man in the hills near the city on video a few years ago, and by itself is biting satire, and it's funny, and by itself it would do a really good job of ""show, don't tell"" when it comes to the writers' politics, too. But it's in the middle of a movie that apparently was focus-grouped by people kicked out of Copblock for being too extreme, so it loses what would other wise be really good meaningful impact, as well as being really hilarious dark humor at the cops' expense.Reason 2: Unfunny banter.The banter between Pena and his kids is dysfunctional in a way that goes from black comedy to just mean, and not entertainingly mean.His banter with his wife strays well into the realm of pretentiously unfunny - though the discussions hint at the writer's proclivities.Skarsgard's character is like a film student exploration of Riggs from the more cartoonish Lethal Weapon sequel combined with the more absurd aspects of Trainspotting. And he's equally unfunny.War On Everyone would probably benefit from a ""What's Up Tiger Lily"" treatment and having much of the dialog changed. It could be funny, but isn't.Reason 3: It's trying too hard to be edgy and indie. This is where the trying-too-hard dialogue and politics really converge to be a crappy movie. It also converges with an overuse of dutch angles that just make it obnoxious.It's like watching a parody of movies written by people who gather in indie circles with their indie friends to watch things so obscure you've never heard of them.It could've been funny, but it wasn't.Long story short: don't waste your time. If you're from Albuquerque or Iceland, watch it on mute for the scenery."

It's so friggin' awesome.It's like a blend of Quentin Tarantino and Shane Black but with its own distinct flavor and it is really entertaining. The characters, the dialogue, everything about it is top notch.It feels like one distinct artistic voice is being heard, and not being interfered by a bunch of dumb producers. I think that's the benefit of it being a British film.If you liked the Director's previous film ""the Guard"" or his brother's films ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"" you'll definitely like this.Soundtrack is dope. DOPE. There's a funny musical leitmotif throughout too which is very enjoyable. It's just a damn good movie.It has balls too for a modern movie, there are a lot of ""Un-PC Culture"" moments that felt really good to chuckle at.I highly recommend it.

" Simply Brilliant Dark Comedy
",0.743,0.5775,2017-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Meet Terry Monroe and Bob Bolano – they are cops, dirty cops in America (but note, this is a British film) and they are quite happy to be bribed by any crook that is inept enough to come under their purview.Then they come across someone who is probably more dangerous than them and they have to seriously up their game – and the stakes. Along the way we have a plethora of hugely entertaining characters that include ex cons, children drug workers and a bad mime.This does not take itself seriously but it is played with a straight bat. It can also be very nasty and quite violent but above all it is inventive, interesting and never dull. Written and directed by John Michael McDonagh who brought us 'The Guard', 'Calvary' and 'Ned Kelly' this is his master piece, thus far, and is now one of my favourite films of 2016 – the only gripe I have with this is that it runs for a mere 85 minutes and that is far too short for something that was as much fun as this – completely and utterly recommended."
" Will offend some and have others in stitches
",-0.296,0.3092,2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Irish-born, London-based writer/director John Michael McDonagh's previous two films, The Guard (2011) and Calvary (2014), were jet- black comedies set in his native country, and both featured knockout performances from their lead, Brendan Gleeson. McDonagh's debut features were warmly received by critics, especially Calvary, which played out a rather twisted revenge tale against a backdrop of religious guilt. Neither managed to generate much commercial success, but nevertheless made McDonagh hot property and offered him the chance to work in the U.S., much like his brother Martin after In Bruges. Has John gone the way of his brother and delivered a misfire in the mould of the messy Seven Psychopaths?Well in a way, yes. More akin to the broad, bad-taste tale of a corrupt, hateful cop on a journey of redemption in The Guard than the contemplative weight of Calvary, War on Everyone moves the action to Albuquerque, New Mexico and replaces Gleeson with the sharply- dressed, acid-tongued duo of Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Pena as bad cop and badder cop. Skarsgard plays Terry Monroe, an alcoholic, Glen Campbell-loving giant of a man who is prone to violence. Pena is Bob Bolano, an intellectual family man who enjoys philosophical arguments with his wife (Stephanie Sigman) while berating his fat children. They are the worst kind of cops imaginable; both are corrupt beyond belief, taking cuts of every stash or bundle of money they find, and generally f*****g up scumbags left right and centre.McDonagh has great faith in his actors to make these truly despicable characters seemingly defined by their quirks likable, and it's a testament to the leading men that they actually manage to pull it off. Pena can do this kind of thing in his sleep - he could be playing Hitler and will still charm the pants off anybody watching. The real revelation is Skarsgard, showing a real knack for comic timing after previously being resigned to more stoic roles. Apparently Garret Hedlund pulled out at the last minute, and what a stroke of luck that turned out to be. At almost 6""5 and permanently hunched, Skarsgard often resembles a slow-witted giant come to stomp the place to pieces, instantly banishing all memory of the ripped hunk of The Legend of Tarzan. The duo's chemistry really holds the film together, as the remainder is little more than a mishmash of violence, colourful characters and homages.Another way to make loathsome characters more sympathetic is by pitting them against someone even more heinous. Here the big villain is English aristocrat James Mangan (Theo James), a narcissistic psychopath whose planned heist with Muslim convert and police informer Reggie X (Malcolm Barrett) ends in a bloodbath. Terry and Bob still want their cut though, but the well-spoken Lord may prove too powerful to intimidate, especially with police chief Gerry Stanton (Paul Reiser) and City Hall breathing down their necks. It's not a particularly interesting story to build a collection of shakedowns, car chases and shoot-outs around, but some relief is offered in the relationship between Terry and former stripper Jackie (Tessa Thompson), who form a sweet romance amidst all the misanthropy. A certain step back after the mastery of Calvary, War on Everyone will offend some but have others in stitches, and I'm somewhere in between."

On the plus side the acting is good and a lot of the sardonic humour played very well for me.On the down side this movie just seemed to have a lack of direction and a real ""point"" it was driving toward. I've read other reviews here about how the lack of point itself may be the point, but I think that is letting the filmmaker off the hook. I don't think that's really what they were going for.It feels like they wanted at times to make a very black comedy about power, corruption, and the pointlessness of it all (for some), but at other times it's more of a light-hearted and sarcastic ""buddy cop"" flick, and they two just don't quite gel.Good acting, it looks great, and a lot of funny moments make this a worthwhile watch though."
" Film Review: War On Everyone
",-0.5994,-0.9751,2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Philosopher Thomas Hobbes foretold a future ""War of All Against All"" in his book Leviathan, published in 1651. In his political/philosophical novel, he wrote his masterpiece during the English Civil War, which occurred from 1642-1651, arguing that a state of sovereignty is the only which way a body of politics can operate, without interference for third party or outside sources and individuals. His ""War of All Against All"" is an idea that was derived from the 'state of nature argument', where government can only be successful if it is strong, undivided and unified.Now, I'm not sure if writer/director John Michael McDonagh intentionally wrote a script and titled a picture that could (not only be) so relevant in the United States with regards to government and policing today, but also, be such a comical and cynical interpretation of the very brutalities happening within America involving its citizens and civilians with such bravado, and most of all balls. One has to wonder, is McDonagh warning everyone, or just laughing at them, especially since it's titled is source from such a serious and foreboding doctrine.McDonagh, who was born in London, England, but is most notably known for being a very predominant Irish citizen, and the older brother of Martin McDonagh (considered one of the greatest living Irish playwrights today) delved deep, back into crime comedy genre with War On Everyone after The Guard became the most successful Irish Independent film of all time. Similar to The Guard, which starred his frequent collaborator and muse Brendan Gleeson, McDonagh decided to shoot his third film in the United States for the first time, keeping away from his native Irish land, and uses the landscapes of Albuquerque, New Mexico as a hellish field of nightmares. Surrounding his narrative on two very intractable corrupt cops who makes it their mission in life, and in their careers, to make every scumbag and criminal who crosses their path, as miserable and unfortunate as possible, War on Everyone is easily one of the most unsettling yet hard-hitting black comedies of 2016 that leaves all regard out the door.While the premise and story of War is nothing to marvel at, the film itself, is easily one of the hardest films to look away from and not finish, thanks to the outlandish and quite unexpected direction McDonagh decided to take his story and characters on. Luckily for us, McDonagh decided to venture off with new actors to play the role of intimidating asshole cops on crack, to a new level.With Peña, an actor who isn't unfamiliar with playing policemen or governing officials in the past, thanks to roles in Babel, Observe and Report, My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, Gangster Squad, Vacation, the upcoming CHIPS and of course, one of my favourite of Peña's roles, Mike Zavala in David Ayer's masterpiece End of Watch, Peña could practically get a job as a cop with all his experience in the role. As Peña's partner, McDonagh choose someone who has never played a cop before. Luckily for us, actor Alexander Skarsgård literally stumbled upon the role from a video that went viral, showcasing the actor at a soccer match, drunkenly rooting for his team, leading a chant, and being completely and utterly intoxicated, making not only a huge fool of himself, but showing director McDonagh everything he needed to see for his beloved Terry character. Thanks for Skarsgård behaviour during his intense period of inebriation, the video secured the role for the towering actor, whose character Terry is an un-wreckable force of chaos and brutality with no brake or lever for control, a role Skarsgård completely punches and bruises into us without apology. Skarsgård is absolutely, unapolgetically, relentlessly perfect as Terry.While every citizen in The United States are well aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent, War is a film that really doesn't say too much, other than offer an unlimited sources of one- liners and crass, crude jokes, heavy racial slander and bizarre perspective of criminals, but also allows the action seen on screen to speak for itself. Certain scenes in the film play off as set pieces in a play, where the intention and purpose of meaning is never really understood or comprehended, showing off personalities of certain characters and their interaction with one another, as well as bizarre interpretation of the coming to reality of a scorn and doomed society. One of these very characters is the introduction of Jackie Harris (Tessa Thompson), who plays Terry's love interest, and inevitable life-partner. The two share very awkward tonal scenes that resemble instances of a musical, a horror and a romantic comedy, yet, Jackie's relationship with Terry reveals absolutely nothing about him, other than his inconsistent ability to enforce ethics and morals to people, without ever compromising his own corrupt personality and desire and obsession with greed.While Terry and Bob set fire to the world around them, including their own personal and family lives, the two indulge in the perks of having a badge, which include consuming countless narcotics that that they confiscate, including a large portion of cocaine from a mime-on-the-run (do mimes make a noise when you run over them?), large quantities of cash that they use for their own personal use, and beat up physically, verbally and mentally civilian that crosses their path. Luckily for the audience, everyone within the War world has as much as quick witted, vulgar tongue to argue back with are two unluckily antiheroes, that the dialogue is a measure of how far McDonagh's script actually pushing the boundaries. Luckily, no secondary characters are truly able to deliver comebacks that compare to the joint efforts of the corrupt duo. With no regard for women, race, culture or social status, the levels of offence and discrimination are pushed in each and every scene and word that comes out of Bob and Terry's mouths."
" In trying to be funny and original it failed to deliver on every aspect of what makes movies fun
",0.6369,-0.8789,2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"Greetings from Lithuania.""War on Everyone"" (2016) had some great idea under the concept, but failed to achieve what it intended to do. I got the idea - but i wasn't laughing. You can feel the brilliants in this movie in every scene - the tone, some very rough and rude comedy that pulls no punches, but unfortunately in trying to do this ""different"" and original film they forgot to make it simply good - ""War on Everyone"" fails to deliver what it intended to. Here you have Michael Peña, one of the most reliable comic relief and good actors around and he fails to make a single laugh - that is because script was so focused to be rude that it forgot to be funny at the same time. And the whole plot was just a mess, some mix of scenes that does not click.Overall, ""War on Everyone"" isn't not a funny movie, nor entertaining, nor involving. I got the idea behind the tone but i wasn't laughing nor i was involved into story, this isn't a good nor even OK film, its a big mess."
" A weird modern tribute/homage/caricature of 70's cop fiction
",-0.1779,-0.8085,2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I really liked War On Everyone, to me it was an alternate reality made through the trope of American cop movies and TV from the 70's. Not the real 70's but the film fiction of the 1970's but with the movie actually set in modern times.I also noticed the viewer has to pay attention or you will miss the connection of each scene to the next (no checking your cell phone). War On Everyone is a tightly woven film where a homage to 70's film/TV style might be too obscure for anyone under 50 or someone who never watched old 70's cop stuff. The movie probably needed some objective editing from someone besides the writer/director.I'm 54 and I thought War On Everyone was very funny. :-) I have a tomboy mom who took me to every car chase movie that came out in the 70's - R rated included - and her favorite TV shows (that me and my brother were 'forced' to watch) were Mannix, Dragnet, and Adam 12. I loved Starsky and Hutch 1975 (Huggy Bear reference in WOE). It probably helped me like the movie.The movie does not pull it's punches in swearing, offensive racial slurs, and bawdy humor but it strangely passes the Bechdel test when the two main female characters have a scene where they talk to each other about their travels.War On Everyone is movie where everyone has their faults but seems to ask the questions, ""Does societies definition of right and wrong mean anything, are there acceptable degrees of wrongness and is there a line that even ""bad"" people won't cross?"""
" Weak, secondary, just cheap
",-0.4404,-0.9541,2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"The film is awful. As said commentator moive_dood earlier, it's full of dull clichés (of pretending ""original art"" films I can add).Well, comedy is just a name. I'm not too into those names, so it's O.K. for me to not even try to be smiling at such ""comedies"".But this film is _nothing_, absolutely nothing. It's void of anything. A couple of pretending lines about philosophy, some referencing books, colours... Plot... O.K. plot with some absurdity, but till 9 minutes before the very end. Trashing of all intentions. Or may be that's the laugh? Stupid cliché about justice and ""poor innocent kid revenged""?The ""**"" from me is for semi nude scenes with Theo James and Alexander Skarsgaard (unfortunately not simultaneously, but even that couldn't get ""***"" from me).Even technically colours are bad, the picture is full of artefacts and so on.Well, one more reason for ""**"" and not ""*"" is a hint of anti-political-correctness.Sometimes nice music is not suited at most of situations in this film. Drugs... Yes, life is dull and irreal, solipsism is above all... But why in this irreal world of no time (old phones, new TVs, old music, new ISIS...) drug taking is so detailing realistic? Hate that.The thing that killed the film for me is it's final of course. ""Poor kid touched their hearts and God helped them"". Awee. Starting with total cynicism approving it all the way you can't, just can't end like this. It's not only stupid it's just off the taste. Cheap in the sense of thoughts."
" Limited viewing access
",-0.2263,0.42,2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"I really would like to see this movie as I am a Theo James fan. Apparently it is extremely limited across the U.S. as I cannot find it within a hundred miles of where I live. It frustrates me no end that most of the limited viewing options are probably on the east or west coast and not in the Midwest where I live. Kindly consider this as to future films. Also at least see if the DVD can't be more accessible in U.S. format and not the U.K. format. It seems most of the DVD's that can be found are Region 2. They may or may not work in the U.S. If I could see it, I would give it at least an 8 or 9 vote simply because Theo James is in it. He is my favorite male actor."
" Totally amoral fun
",0.1742,0.9793,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"This is the story of two corrupt cops but played from laughs. It is like Lethal Weapon but instead of solving the crime they only care about the loot (money drugs or anything else) but they still have some minimal moral standard that make them do the right thing (well not exactly but still acceptable). the cynical alcoholic partner.The movie uses some of the typical clichés of police thrillers for fun. Criminals run free because they are British Lords and Police chief is only interested in avoid conflicts and does not like to be botheredMichael Pena has already shown he can be very funny (check him in Ant Man) but here is outstanding. Alexander Skarsgård is equally good, while the rest of the cast is game too.This is a comedy but it is not The Naked Gun and not for kids. There are extremely violent scenes and the level of corruption of the two main characters is obscene. By the end; they do something good (killing everybody) but still are far from redeemed. In brief; the type of comedy you usually do not see in this politically correct country. It is a pity it never got proper distribution and publicity while other CRAP gets a better push and released in thousands of screens."
" 2016 and He Still Wants to Be Tarantino
",0.0,-0.6531,2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,We all wanted to be Quentin Tarantino but that was two decades ago. Find a new heroor try to do something remotely original. This wasn't even remotely original.Strip club scene. Wow! Highly completely ultimately the least original thing imaginable.This was so completely terrible and unoriginal that I can't believe that it was even made. You would think that at least one important person along the line in the production would have said out loud that this thing was a turd not worth producing. An orgy of stupidity and violence capped off with an insult of an ending. Bravo!

" this was absolute trash
",0.0,-0.8796,2017-01-10 00:00:00,2,"i hated the storyline, i hated how they swore so much. i hated the nude scenes and i hate when they think those scenes are necessary to get views. what i hated the most was how they kept making fun of muslims and arabs. this movie was sick for one huge reason; they joked about how it wasn't okay to harass anyone unless they were an ARAB. Who the hell gave Americans or anyone the luxury to decide if it was okay or not to harass arabs! who said anyone owned arabs or muslims or anyone?! i know Hollywood and movies and actors just want to send a message through their work. if this is the message they wanted to send then Hollywood and that whole cast are monsters. if they're trying to say that it's okay for them to harass arabs then they shouldn't be surprised when we actually decide to stop staying quiet. these stuff shouldn't be ignored. i don't remember arabs ever deciding whether it was fine to harass American or other people from other nationalities, but maybe we should start thinking that way. we were never violent, but i guess it is true how some of you people can be mentally ill pigs. sorry, i think i insulted pigs."
" How are people rating this so highly?
",0.0,-0.7591,2017-01-09 00:00:00,2,"This was an utter waste of time. It was so bad I'm angry I sat through it waiting for it to achieve the 6.1 rating it currently has.I don't mind bad movies when they're funny or have some redeeming qualities, but this has none. Far too many names were attached to this movie for it to be so bad. At no time did you feel anything for any of these characters.They threw every cliché storyline at it, but then resolved the entire movie in the last 7 minutes. Save your time and do some laundry. Watching your clothes spin around in the machine would be more entertaining."
" Crazy Wonderful!!
",0.4374,0.9691,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Two Wild and Crazy Guys who pull out all the stops is what John Michael McDonagh had in mind when he created this totally outrageous over the top masterpiece.I loved the chemistry between Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Pena, I think more than any buddy movie I've ever seen, except for maybe ""Freebie and the Bean,"" with Alan Arkin and James Caan. They were just great together, and together they hit this one right over the center field wall.I'll own this because I definitely plan on watching it again and again. If you like black comedies where they've thrown out the rule book, you're going to love this.My highest recommendation for pure unadulterated entertainment."
" For smart people with dark senses of humor.
",0.5859,0.9632,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I LOVED THIS FILM... There are a lot of negative comments and reviews. They are all too film preachy. A regular audience will love the chemistry between the two main characters. Even as they realize that these are bad cops you will want them to win. The reason being that one without the other would never have gotten them to this place. Pena smart intellectual character tempers Skarsgards crazy. Making this the perfect team to look out for themselves as cops and not get caught doing it. It's just an enjoyable movie for the intelligent people with dark senses of humor. I believe films are for pure enjoyment. When I early on realized that even as these are dirty cops. They are still ones I can enjoy being dirty. They are of course only hurting very, very bad guys. Enjoy all!!!"
" Terrible directing and sad....what a waste
",-0.7096,-0.7072,2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,This must be the most terrible direction to be wasted on a decent script and talent with so much potential. Just when people say a good script can't be screwed up by an untalented director. Here is proof. It was like watching a beginner director try to piece meal together little skits of short scenes with no flow whatsoever and music all over the place with camera edits and shots that felt so flat it was just dull; everything was wrong and you almost wish they could done with a real good director. A shame anyone can try to give this director more than 1 star unless they are high as a kite.I read some reviews that people walked out of this film but now i understand how terrible it is. It tried so hard to want to be a Tarantino/Guy Richie type of film...but fell short. Save your money and do not waste it on this dull film. 1 star because there is no 0 for a refund.
" Very funny and entertaining - for some people.
",0.7474,0.9389,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"This was a great movie! Why? Because I'm a misanthrope, and this movie was made for me. The people who have been giving this film bad reviews miss the whole point of comedies such as this, and others, that target a specific type of person with a specific type of humor. Some comedies are universally funny to most everyone, and that's okay, too. But this movie is not one of those. Personally, I've never understood why a male who was offended or disappointed by a film that was clearly made to entertain a female audience, takes the time to review the film and trash it. Hey guy! The movie was not for you, so stop hating on it. Me, I loved this film. But again, I have a misanthropic sense of humor. If you don't, then don't watch the movie. If you do, have fun :)"
" Crazy friggin' movie... I loved it!
",0.4714,-0.5972,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I agree with the review ""Unstructured Mess,"" by Greg from Ontario.Except I come to a much different conclusion: This is simply cinema showing us the utter meaninglessness of it all -- not necessarily a point I agree or disagree with. So we must endure it all, strange, bizarre, baffling, stupid, ridiculous, and so on, all in the midst of an utter wasteland. As such, we can only live in the present moment, the best we can.The soundtrack is over the top, with its Latino/Rock/Glen Campbell mix. The music makes the meaninglessness bearable!So as Greg from Ontario writes, it's pure, unstructured mess. In my opinion, that gives you two choices:Take it or leave it!"
