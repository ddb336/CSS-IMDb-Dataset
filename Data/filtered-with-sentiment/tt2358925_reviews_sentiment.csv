" Razzy Nominee
",0.0,-0.8059,2021-03-23 00:00:00,5,If Dave Franco did not win a Razzy for worst actor I want a recount. His character was cringeworthy/annoying and unfunny. If the movie ever had a chance it was derailed every time he was in a scene
" It was cute...
",0.0,0.9442,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"It was cute, the family drama, it brought tears to me, his dreamy, confident and determined personality enchanted me, the mood oscillating between black and slapstick, but always in the right measure, Vince is great, adorable ..."
" Movie with mess, adventure and comedy
",0.3182,0.7438,2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie tells a story of a trip that 3 employees take to save the company's business.This trip happens a lot of mess, clutter, etc. This moment in the movie is very interesting because this mess holds your attention in the movie.It's a comedy movie but you probably won't laugh so much but I think it's worth watching. Yes, it's cool"
" Breath of fresh air from overzealous comedy tropes
",0.5859,0.9605,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Whoa! Glad I stumbled onto this movie. In this current climate, three underdogs struggling to make their biz a success despite numerous challenges is a huge sell for me, and it was. Not much of a range stretch from Vince Vaughn though it was a realistic portrayal of a dad trying to juggle work and family. Dave Franco continues to surprise me yet again with his laudable performance as a special needs adult. Definitely more to him than his good looks. Guy's got more range than his brother. Will always love the legendary Tim Wilkinson but he was underused here, and a character that was too beaten down. That rebellious fighter spark in a 67 year old could have been more played out I feel. Otherwise, nice slices of life here...some so relatable on so many levels. It's a chillax kind of movie so adjust your stoner-over-the top-comedy expectations when you're 'in' Europe for this one. You might just enjoy it."
" Light comedy without decent comedy.
",0.6124,0.9736,2020-11-15 00:00:00,5,"Vince Vaughn is usually even the guarantor of a quality film. Or well of good quality and high quality, in my opinion, many have been. Maybe I'm a little fan.The beginning seemed promising. Interesting characters came up and topics that everyone should think about were also discussed.But the film felt really long, with a length of only an hour and a half .. It's not a good thing .. A few good laughs got, which is also not a terribly good thing.Let's just say that maybe a movie to watch once, preferably with a beer!"
" Cute
",0.4588,0.9217,2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"This was a cute movie. Although a little adult mixed with immature, it had nudity. It had a pretty good storyline and the actors were great."
" Time is money
",0.0,-0.7816,2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately a waste of time.
Yea, there are a few dialogues which are quite good and a few scenes worth watching, but overall it's a waste of time, unfortunately."
" not that funny
",-0.3412,0.2215,2020-06-18 00:00:00,3,"The premise and cast were good so i was optimistic but i was very disapointed. during this one and a halv hour movie i laughed once.theres where so many moments for a good joke but they just completely missed everytime. escpecially with mike pancake. his gimmic was that he was mentaly handicapped, but also that he had a dumb name. its not even a clever name just "" funny because random"" they even met another character who where bullied for his name, wich was kelly or something. so obvious setup for a name like ""tommy waffle"" such weird writing"
" All time favorite
",0.4588,0.8349,2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,This movie its' an absolut gem! It's the perfect combination between comedy and life lessons! Top of the shelf movie!
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.8746,2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Really enjoyed this movie and made me laugh a lot, I highly recommend you watch it"
" Hilarious, great date night movie!
",0.7959,0.9538,2020-03-21 00:00:00,8,Solid comedy with well placed nudity and lots of belly laughs. Fantastic character development and just hits all the right notes. If you loved Wedding Crashers this is its close 2nd. Well done!
" Please don't complete it then
",0.3182,-0.4767,2020-02-11 00:00:00,2,"I stumbled upon this via the Netflix algorithm and all I can say is ""where there's blame, there's a claim""Sometimes I think Vince Vaughan must have some very tasty photos of some very high up Hollywood executives because this man can't act for nuts.I still don't a clue what was happening just that a fancy a pancake (English style) with lemon & orange squeezed on it.Only avoids 1 because there may be something out there I've not seen yet"
" So overlooked
",-0.101,0.854,2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,Honestly I don't know why this movie didn't get what it deserved. It's really hilarious and heartwarming.
" face value is essential in this or any comedy
",0.5994,-0.9824,2020-01-26 00:00:00,5,"My first comment is directed towards the 100 or so reviews that I skimmed through. I watch a lot of movies, over the years, many foreign films, and a whole lot of non a-list hollywood block busters. As far as reviewing goes, really reviewers should have to briefly describe their preferences before they go into reviewing a movie. and also understand what kind of movie they are watching before they write a review, and not go omg that food fair sushi place was so bad, i lived in japan for 5 years and i have to say the sushi at this place was sub part blablabla really? stop judging something by the wrong standards. This movie is not like all comedies Vaughn has been in. Stop expecting the same type of comedy in every movie you see. If you don't do anything but action packed gun toting bang bang thrillers, dont go watch a foreign flick and complain it was boring. It's not action driven. It's character driven. See I cook for a living, and people ask for my suggestion or opinion all the time, and it would be ignorant of me to say oh no you don't want the eggplant parm, it's awful- for the mere reason that I personally have never liked eggplant. Now if the eggplant parm were burnt, I would say it was overcooked. If you ask me about the steak, I will not say oh it was overcooked. Some people like blue rare, some like med, some like well done, and each to their own. People are just way too presumptious and pompous. This is a slower moving comedy because it is character driven. It's not Clerks or Kumar and it's not Airplane. There are so many different types of comedy. Figure out what it is you're into AND what you are about to watch before you you hit 'review this title' . I enjoyed this movie for what it was, but I like Vince Vaughn. Not like run out and purchase every movie he's ever done. Other times I like some other type of comedy. Depends on my mood, but I will not sit here and tell you this movie was boring because it didn't have American Pie gaffes every 2 seconds from start to finish or shock jock lines a la Dane Cook. You want a slower comedy with some story attached on human condition then this is your movie. But again, make up your own mind."
" Poor scenario
",-0.4767,0.0714,2020-01-12 00:00:00,3,They could do much better. Also the performances are not very good.
" Vanilla
",0.0,0.7568,2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"It's not a great movie and has its humerus moments. Vince Vaugn and the old guy provide most of the comedic value, whilst Dave Francos character is cringy at best. I got nothing against Dave Franco and love his work, but in this movie it's simply hard to watch. Overall, an okay movie"
" The worst movie i have seen in a very long time
",-0.6249,-0.9127,2019-12-06 00:00:00,1,"Nothing attracts you in this movie. It definately is one of the worst movies in the history of cinema. Absolutely disappointing. If we could rate movies in minuses, i would have given this movie a minus 5 rating. Total waste of time"
" Horrible
",-0.5423,0.8481,2019-11-22 00:00:00,2,No redeeming value except that Chuck is pretty attractive & entertaining which elevated my rating from 1 star to 2.
" Enjoyable nonsense
",0.0516,0.323,2019-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Is this a film you need to think about or analyse in detail? No. Does it have an expected ending? Of course. Is it worth 90 minutes of your life? Absolutely!
Not an intelligent film, but very funny and just a little gross. Worth a watch."
" Unfinished Business
",0.0,0.5106,2019-07-20 00:00:00,4,4/10 - unfunny mess of a movie even with some true talents among the cast
" Good movie. Funny. I watched it twice and will again.
",0.7003,0.7783,2019-07-08 00:00:00,8,"It's a movie with lines that I can easily quote. As a frequent business traveler, I can relate to the film. Good chemistry with the main 3 characters. If you don't take yourself too seriously then you will enjoy it."
" As a comedy it never started
",0.3612,-0.7287,2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,"When Vince Vaughn is ripped away from his usual comedy sidekicks, expect a lame turkey.Vaughn on his own cannot do comedy where he essentially is the straight man. This gross out comedy is an epic failDan Trunkman (Vince Vaughn) is a sales guy who refuses to take a pay cut and leaves to start his own company.He has with him an over the hill Timothy McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) and dimwit Mike Pancake (Dave Franco.)A year on, the company is struggling and Trunkman takes the three of them to Berlin to pitch for a make or break deal and beat his former company to the deal.By setting most of the film in Berlin we have a fish out of water comedy that takes in Berlin's landmarks and its sleazy club culture.The trouble is this film is just so unfunny. It can be crude one minute and then the next minute Trunkman is on Skype dealing with his domestic life such as his overweight son being bullied.It is so erratic like it had so many hands in the script that by the end. There was no comedy left."
" my notes
",0.0,-0.952,2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,HORRIBLE. not funny. so cheesy and corny. horrible dialogue. awful jokes. basically everything they said was useless. terrible characters (1 viewing)
" Humour was great, story was okay
",0.8442,0.9948,2019-06-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie was one of the few movies that actually made me laugh out loud. The lines were naturally funny and the jokes weren't forced unlike many comedy movies. The characteristics and personalities of each character was well made as each of them contributed to the authentic humour of the film. Dave Franco impressed me with his role. I personally think that this is one of his best performances. He was able to attract the audience from the very beginning and his character was very funny and likeable.Although the humour was great, the story / plot was meh. It felt like the writers weren't very serious about delivering the main plot and instead they were focusing on the humour of the film. The story / plot was a big letdown for the film. I believe that the movie would've been great if the writers added more details to the story and not just using such a basic and unappealing plot.Overall, the movie wasn't bad. It's a good film to watch if you're just looking for a movie to cheer you up and make you laugh."
" Wow
",0.5859,0.3599,2019-02-16 00:00:00,4,"This may not be the worst film on the history of film. Or maybe it is, Franco is the only reason I didn't give it a 1/10. Over 1500 films I've watched this one is definitely in the bottom 50. Vince Vaughn continues his streak of bad movies."
" It was alright...that's about it.
",0.0,0.949,2019-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Vince Vaughn is actually pretty fantastic in this film, the real tragedy here was Dave Franco. Sadly, Franco's character falls incredibly flat. I think I know what they were trying to do with his character, but it comes across all wrong to me. He had a few moments that were pretty funny, but other times it just seemed extremely forced. It's too bad because I think Dave is actually a pretty talented actor, he just fell victim to the character in this role.I absolutely have no clue why Tom Wilkinson would sign on for this movie, just completely out of left field for me. He acts it well, but he also comes across as extremely crass and one-sided, he has one specific moment where we actually see who his character is, but other than that moment, it's very surface level.It's nice to see Vaughn as the ""straight"" man here and I enjoyed his performance, but the movie has no real substance to it...would have loved to see more dynamic."
" Not up to potential no thanks to Vince
",0.1779,0.7003,2018-12-29 00:00:00,6,"Would've been far better without Vince Vaughn, he just somehow brings the tone down from other characters that could be effective and indeed let's the movie down :( disappiinting with the promising cast"
" ok it's a high 7!
",0.3595,0.9501,2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,Yes it's a bit easy humor. But in the category this movie is (will Ferrell/hangover humor) it should get a passing grade here. It's an enjoyable funny movie and excellent for a watch after a hard day's work!
" Worth a watch...
",0.2263,0.6359,2018-12-24 00:00:00,4,The actors is what makes the movie without vince and franco it may have not been so interesting. Although the length time was only1.30 hr it defitnley dragged a little other then that it was worth the watch.
" A mix of serious and funny. NOT a straight comedy, because of the melancholic undertone. Good acting by Vince Vaughn and Tom Wilkinson, but kinda average movie overall.
",0.1808,-0.7857,2018-12-06 00:00:00,5,"Not great, not terrible either. From the same writer that gave us ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" with Ben Stiller. That movie had the same mix of melancholy and tongue in cheek jokes as this movie.That movie with Ben Stiller worked out great. Unfortunately ""Unfinished Business"" falls short of expectations.Some jokes are good, most of them are a bit bland though. The serious part of this story, about child bullying isnt really convincing because of some average acting by the kids. And it feels as if this serious subject about child bullying is somewhat at odds with the slapstick nature of the rest of the story which is a somewhat bland copy of ""The Hangover"".All in all still a charming quirky picture that is only suited though for those who love the melancholy comedy genre which produces a mix of serious subjects with hilarious slap stick. Funny enough for 1 watch when there is nothing better to see."
" great concept poorly executed
",0.6249,0.6249,2018-11-21 00:00:00,1,Review: I didn't find this to be all that great of a movie. The direction and screenplay are both sub par. Both the casting and acting are sub-par also. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars.
" Skip it
",0.0,0.2382,2018-11-03 00:00:00,1,"This film is filler. What's his name, the star of the film is better than this but I can understand where he is coming from, he is just out to collect a paycheck."
" WHO'S YER DADDY?
",0.0,-0.9757,2018-04-19 00:00:00,4,"Dan Trunkman (Vince Vaughn) walks out of his company and starts his own firm. He takes with him Tim McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) a 67 year old employee who was let go due to restructuring and Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) a slow kid who was there interviewing for a job. He thinks they are going to build a starship.The work they actually do is selling ""swarf"" which is metal waste. Apparently this is a tough competitive business whose details the film spares us. Our three misfits travel to Berlin to compete against their old company on a proposal. Dan has all kind of problems at home which he handles by phone until he gets tired and freezes his face causing his family to blame the cell phone and hang up. Oh sorry that was part of the comedy.The subplot with the kids was poorly executed and was literally phoned in. The character development for the two side kicks didn't start until over halfway through and the problem was they sad characters desperately trying to break some mold. This appears to be a film that you would expect Seth Rogen and James Franco to carry with a few ad libs. The jokes failed. Bad script. Actors never had a chance."
" What is the goal of a movie of this nature?
",0.0,0.8945,2018-03-01 00:00:00,10,"TO MAKE US LAUGH! There doesn't need to be any deeper messages or symbolism. This movie made me laugh harder than any other movie I've seen, and the humor was consistent throughout. Who cares if it wasn't ""artistic"" in a sense? That's not the goal. The purpose of the movie is to make us laugh at stupid stuff, and the cast went far and beyond that purpose. Dave Franco takes this movie to a whole new level, he plays his character perfectly. I am in utter shock of how bad of ratings this movie got, because it is my favorite comedy! That being said, my taste is stupid humor that lacks thought; however, that type of humor is the humor of the 21st century. There are no intelligent jokes, no well-thought out scenes, but I wouldn't have it any other way."
" Loyalty and overcoming obstacles
",0.2263,0.9841,2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"After five or ten minutes my husband said turn it off but I waited. At the end of the movie he was laughing and had enjoyed it very much. The acting was solid and convincing. So, sit back and go with the flow. It is about a man who leaves his job to start his own company albeit quite small. The characters are endearing including his wife and two children and two employees. His younger employee is sweet and simple but shows he can do the job. It is about loyalty to family and the people you work with and having fun. Life has possibilities and obstacles can be overcome. I bordered on giving it a seven but thought it was worth a bit more."
" I ACTUALLY enjoyed it!
",0.5562,0.9214,2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"So, I don't know why this has such a negative rating on Netflix and IMDb. I mean, I do know why...it's predictable and uses an outdated template for feel good movies. But it still makes you feel GOOD. Which is the whole point, right? I mean, who doesn't like Vince Vaughn? He's gold. Anyway, I thought this definitely deserved an up vote. If you find yourself rooting for the good guys then the movie makers have done their job. Solid 7/10"
