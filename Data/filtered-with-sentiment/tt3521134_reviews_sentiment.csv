" Documentary Filmmaking at Its Best
",0.6369,-0.5089,2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"Not as spectacular as ""The Act of Killing"" but incredibly chilling, ""The Look of Silence"" offers the experience of something most of us won't live (hopefully). It's scary to look at these people and imagine what they must have lived and what they are feeling at time of those interviews.Joshua Oppenheimer made a courageous film that forces us to confront the perils of the world and of our own society. Now this is what documentary films must strive for."
" The trip in the worst recesses of human darkness continues, with a positive message at the end
",-0.3612,-0.951,2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"In this ""sequel"" of sorts to the Act of Killing that focuses on the struggle of a man to know the responsabilities behind his brother's death, with stronger ties with Annah Arend't Banality of Evil than its predecessor in a sense that dehumanizing acts were done in 1965 without no one taking responsability for them and a hopeful idea behind the protagonist's will to still see humans and not complete and total inhuman beasts in the atrocious killers he interviews. A must watch after its main companion."
" The Look of Silence magnifies the immorally glorified souls of those who slaughtered millions of innocent ""communists"".
",0.3818,-0.9691,2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"""We'd drag them. Some of them screamed. 'Please, sir! Have mercy!' But we don't care. In fact, we beat him again to shut him up."". Two former death camp leaders proudly re-create the grisly scenes of the '65 purge of supposed ""communists"" under the instigation of the armed forces, which became widely known as the Indonesian Genocide. Documentarian Oppenheimer asks them an explicit question. ""from here, can the prisoners see the blood?"". ""Yes, because the place was lit by torches."", they enthusiastically reply. ""Because others went first. So he's given up hope. 'I'm about to die', he's thinking. 'I'd better accept it'"", they describe the apparent thoughts of their victims before decapitating, mutilating and kicking their bodies into Snake River. ""Feel free to take a photo!"", passing a digital camera to Oppenheimer. They joyously pose atop the butchered souls of thousands, their blood stains infused with the earth they stand on. One of the killers hoists two fingers in the air, offering a peace sign, before proceeding with a thumbs up gesture.Oppenheimer utilised this blood-curdling footage years later, by showing its profound horror to a middle-aged Indonesian man whose brother was an unfortunate victim of the national purge. Acknowledging the explicit nature of his country's past and yearning to learn more, he singlehandedly confronts the perpetrators who executed the killings with Oppenheimer documenting the anxiety-inducing conversations, under the pretence of an eye examination. Through the changing of lenses, this metaphorical dissimulation magnifies the retinas of ""Adi's"" brother's executors, allowing windows into their darkened souls to widen.Predictably, much like with Oppenheimer's creatively profound companion piece 'The Act of Killing', these individuals expressed minimal remorse. Proud to serve their nation and glorify their political ideologies. However, the purpose of these bleak confrontations was not to agitate those that committed such atrocities, but to perpetuate a historic generational divide within Indonesia. The current generation educated with false truths to adhere to the current sociopolitical climate. ""Communists gouged the eyes out of army generals"", students are taught. Yet the truth couldn't be any further from that manipulative fabrication. Everyone seemingly forced into silence regarding the questioning of their own national history. Therefore, producing such an unflinching documentary that dares to question the morality and legitimacy behind one of the worst genocides in recent history, is of paramount importance. Not just to Indonesia, but every nation that endures tainted democracy. Inciting societies to educate themselves and not ignore the grave actions of their previous generation.Oppenheimer challenges the boundaries of documentary filmmaking once again, crafting uncompromising perceptive enlightenment through one man. A man whom represented the nullified silence of those feared by their own government. A man whom fearlessly questioned the very individuals that shaped his current standard of living. Representing the suffering and fragility of an oppressed society. Understatedly profound, yet consistently unshakeable in nature. The inclusion of iridescent quietude, from expansive shots of village life to close-ups of metamorphosis, overemphasising the extinguished freedom of speech. Many of the confrontations delivering unwavering tyrannical sensibilities likening their ideologies to totalitarian repression, exhibiting minimal sorrow for the thousands they slaughtered. Conversations that rightly bury the words under the skin to those listening. Ranging from indirect threats such as ""be careful, what you're doing may be deemed as communist behaviour"" to Western influences including ""America taught us how to hate communists"". Undoubtedly disconcerting.Reservations for the confrontation with ""Adi's"" uncle, whom was guarding ""communists"" before they were massacred, is the sole criticism this documentary obtains. Staged, exploitative and unnecessarily producing familial drama in a nation that is already fragmented and traumatised. Consequently Oppenheimer overstepped the line in that particular instance, despite ""Adi's"" insistence, creating an artificially uncomfortable atmosphere for the sake of drama.However, whilst not creatively innovative as his former insight into the Indonesian Genocide, Oppenheimer's The Look of Silence unequivocally nullifies all emotive output, perhaps more so that his previous directorial efforts. It is unflinching. It is uncompromising. It is of paramount significance. We need boundary-testing documentaries like this to truly provide insight and to evoke human right activism. To microscopically magnify the actions of humanity's past and ensure they never happen again. ""That's politics. Politics is the process of achieving your ideals"", the former commander of civilian militia joyously states with a grimace. ""In many ways...""."
" A horrifying examination of killers who didn't know they were wrong.
",-0.9022,-0.9971,2020-05-16 00:00:00,9,"It's weird how a documentary can make something as deplorable as killing another human being a chilling experience. If the killings that happened in Indonesia were shown on the screen in all their gory detail, there's a certain point where a viewer's mind just shuts off from all the violence. It's almost too much to watch, which is why interviews with those who did the killings is a different and almost more horrifying way to go about exposing this barbaric event. The Look of Silence (2014) is a tough movie to watch, but it is crucial for understanding how anyone could do something so vile.Put in the framing of an optometrist trying to confront his brother's killers, The Look of Silence has this quiet, stoic energy about the horrific killings in Indonesia. I was in shock when these men talked so candidly, openly, and unabashedly about the atrocities they did to other people. There was no shame in what they did. They were either following orders or felt that it was their divine right to rid the world of these people in the most violent ways imaginable. The things they did to ""remain sane"" were just as gruesome.The cinematography of these series of interviews was quite stunning, even if some shots hold on for too long. I was also in awe of the calm and collected nature of the interviewer, as he was talking with the very people who had brutally killed his brother. He didn't want retribution or revenge. I think he just wanted closure, or at least for these men to start to realize what they had done. Perhaps these men were only part of an older generation who thought that the killings they did were acceptable acts. By modern sensibilities, I hope people like this never come to power anywhere ever again.A horrifying examination of killers who didn't know they were wrong, I give Look of Silence 4.5 stars out of 5."
" Disturbing and perverse
",-0.7269,-0.6275,2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"The confrontation's scenes of murders and the scenarios of killings have caused a lump in the throat. Produced by Errol Morris and Werner Herzog, most of credits were being showed as ""anonymous"", what is symptomatic. If watched after The Act of Killing (the previous documentary of Joshua Oppenheimer), the appreciation will be guaranteed. Wonderful documentary."
" More of the same
",0.0,0.4215,2018-11-28 00:00:00,5,"I don't feel as though this film does anything different than its predecessor. The issue at hand is no doubt important but I don't think I got anything out of this film that I didn't get from The Act of Killing. I understand that it is supposed to be a more personal view of the atrocities but it seems like there isn't much new information.This is a review of the film on its own, not a review of the importance of the work that Oppenheimer is doing. I believe a film's importance and it's quality can be distinguished."
" Shocking
",-0.4019,-0.9797,2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"The Look of Silence. The follow up to Joshua Oppenheimer's incredible The Act of Killing, which focused on the unrepentant perpetrators of the under-reported (thanks to western support) 1965 Indonesian 'Communist' genocide. TLOS not as shocking as its predecessor (one watch was enough) but still eye opening and disturbing. TLOS focuses on the brother of one of the murdered who meets the perpetrators to seek solace and for them to express regret. A must see double bill - but the antithesis of popcorn fodder so not for a cosy date! 8 out of ten (The Act of Killing got 9)"
" Better than its predecessor
",0.4404,-0.9782,2018-10-10 00:00:00,7,"As the follow-up to the Indonesian documentary ""The Act of Killing"" (2012), ""The Look of Silence"" continues the search for truth regarding the mass tortures and murders of suspected communists in Indonesia in the mid-1960s. The main focus of the film is Adi, an optometrist whose brother was brutally killed during the massacres. The film rolls while Adi confronts the various men (or their surviving families) who were involved in his brother's killing.As a real-life subject, Adi must be one of the most admirable people alive today. How he can maintain such composure, grace, and courage is truly remarkable as he peacefully confronts some of the most despicable people on the planet.I gave a mixed review to ""The Act of Killing"" a few years ago. While I highly admired its motive, I felt it gave too much freedom of speech to the killers and torturers who showed no remorse in what they expressed. Being in their presence for so long as they said whatever they wanted was extremely uncomfortable.Thankfully, this is not the case in ""The Look of Silence"". While being interviewed and confronted, these monsters show discomfort and have less opportunity to be pompous.The film's weakness is in its lack of variety. It is mainly a series of interviews with the same structure. However, the results of those interviews are compelling. The camera remains fixed on subjects whose bodies and faces remain still. However, the changes in the texture of their eyes are very revealing.Three of the most moving scenes are those involving families. One involves a killer being confronted while his adult daughter is seated beside him. Another involves the widow and two adult sons of another killer, now deceased. The most gripping is one where Adi confronts a member of his extended family: It finishes with the relative standing as his door staring at Adi who is walking away. One wonders if he, and maybe others, recovered even a tiny bit of humanity during the conversations?"
" Unfathomable
",0.0,-0.9754,2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"It's hard to ""review"" a movie like ""The Look of Silence"". You don't really watch it and evaluate it like you do anything else. You bear witness.I have never been able to write anything about its prequel, ""The Act of Killing"". I broke my rule of reviewing every movie I watch on here because I just wasn't up to the task. Watching that movie, and ""The Look of Silence"" to a slightly lesser extent, was like being dosed with heroin and hit with a sledgehammer. The usual ""disturbing"" movie, documentary or otherwise, has an impact that can be shaken off eventually. With ""The Act of Killing"", I never really felt it, but I knew it was there. It took something from me. The impact bled through into my day to day life. It wasn't just like a bad dream. It was real.Here is ""The Look of Silence"". It gives a different side of the story that ""Act of Killing"" presented, through the son of survivors of the Indonesian genocide. He learns about the fate of his older brother, killed two years before his birth. Then he confronts some of the killers and their families, though these meetings don't go as you might expect, especially for the son, Adi.This movie really should be watched alongside ""The Act of Killing"". Whereas ""The Look of Silence"" is no less horrible in its descriptions of actual murder, I have a feeling that it is the goodness of Adi and his family you will remember."
