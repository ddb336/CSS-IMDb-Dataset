" Too annoying, Kevin Smith realley underwhelmed himself
",-0.4019,-0.9767,2021-04-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just annoying. It's bad, and has zero logic at all. This should be among the worst movies of all time along with Freddy Got Fingered.The movie is complete nonsense. It says ""horror-comedy"", well let's take it apart:
As a comedy this is just not funny, it's boring, the jokes are just simply not good.As a horror it's... well... bad also. Not even creepy, just borderline disgusting, but not even that. That SOMETHING could be laughable, but no, not even that manages to be funny.The story is completely awful, all it does is to make the viewers hate the main character. That's all.TL;DR: not funny, not creepy, just disgusting and boring."
" Hilarious
",0.4019,0.8842,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"I'm writing this as I'm actually watching it and I'm finding this so funny. When I finally see Justin Long as a walrus I burst into hysterics. I mean if you don't see the comedy in this film clearly I don't what to think. Don't quite know what to actually say other than I think this film is hilarious ðŸ˜‚
Plus to be honest I like films that are out there anyway - This Is The End, All Cheerleader's Die, Dogma etc
I just love films that are bonkers"

",0.0,-0.2196,2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I gave it a 10 star to offset the ridiculously low rating of 5.3 currently on IMDB.
This should be a solid 7+ film if only for the performance of Mr Parks.
The silly goodness of every actor and aspect of the film has been greatly under appreciated and I'm ashamed to live in a world that can't be entertained by this flick!"
" So bad that even a Pastor you'll despise all things for a few days after witnessing this abomination.
",-0.7346,-0.946,2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Tusk is nothing short of a complete cinematic atrocity that couldn't even be consider or even lumped in the same category as the most vile and idiotic dada art piece. Any semblance of talent that the main actors and Johnny Depp posses in other projects are completely non existent in this ""film"". If you chose to watch Tusk, despite all the negative reviews and warnings that most people, no doubt, give out to you and others who even consider watching this movie. You only have yourself to blame for the pain and agony you will endure throughout it all of you chose to watch Tusk. All I can conclude with is. Never has rewinding a film, letting it play and then ripping the television screen off the wall, letting the film play out and throwing it out the balcony to it's doom has ever felt more therapeutic."
" You'll never be the same ...

" Wildly Original!
",0.3802,0.5848,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"A totally unpredictable, imaginative and entertaining film. Kevin Smith has crafted a unique variation on H.P. Lovecraft's unsettlingly vision of horror. Kudos!"
" I can't think of a less funny comedy
",0.5898,0.3218,2021-03-05 00:00:00,2,"I've called you out on here a few times before Luke, but holy wow.What sick pleasure did you get from making me and Tuomas watch this? What did you expect would happen?Come to think of it, what sick pleasure did Kevin Smith get out of making this piece of trash? Is this a prank? Like, do you hate every single person who listens to your podcast and was deluded enough to think this was a good idea? Did you get stoned out of your mind while watching The Human Centipede or Misery and think you could do it better?Because, I hate to break it to you, but you couldn't. Seriously. I would rather watch all three Human Centipede films one right after another, because at least they succeed in what they want to do for the most part. What exactly did this film want to do?Did it want to scare me with its awful rubber suit or ridiculous villain? Cause it wasn't scary. Did you want to be funny, with your annoying protagonist and awkward conversation scenes that drag on forever? Cause it wasn't funny, either.Did you perhaps just want me to revel in your protagonist getting what he arguably deserved? Well maybe you achieved that a little bit, but did I enjoy it even slightly? God no.I wanted to stop and do absolutely anything else the entire time. That's what you achieved, Kevin. Your directing is terrible, you've got no imagination for interesting shots, your characters suck (yes I know they're intentionally terrible people, but that's all they are, and simply being terrible people is not enough to make them interesting), and your story is one that I couldn't wait to be over.And I'm not familiar with your other work, but at least when writing a feature film, you're not funny or scary in the least. I'm sorry, but sometimes it's just got to be said.You've made a film that I legitimately wish had worse acting so that I could justify giving it a half star, so count yourself lucky that the people you hired for this are more talented than you.And you couldn't even get the rights for I Am The Walrus to play over the end credits. That's cheap."
" It is interesting movie
",0.4019,0.5829,2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Movie is very interesting because it is bissare in so many ways. I like the story, but i cant say if it is horror movie or some kind of comeddy. I just wanted to make some things clear on other person review. That person said it is unclear how is Walles still alive at the end. Well if you watch movie closely you will realise that he is in the suite that madman made from other ppl... and insade that suite is Walles without his legs and tongue.. so he is not actualy that creature we see in movie.. he is inside that ""costume"" traped because he cant talk or move..."
" I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
",0.0,-0.9539,2021-02-04 00:00:00,4,"'Tusk' makes an impression. I just don't know what that impression says.It's also pretty unforgettable. But what's most memorable about it is no reflection on quality, good or bad, but simply how bizarre it is.Kevin Smith has a very particular brand of comedy that he's brought to so many of his films, and there are elements of it to be found in Justin Long's obnoxious podcaster Wallace; in the attempts of his friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment) to trace his steps; and in the very, very, very surreal absurdity of the entire scenario. Yet if 'Clerks' or 'Dogma' made you laugh out loud, don't rush to jump on the 'Tusk' bandwagon, because Smith's offbeat humor - any humor it all - is kind of sparse here.'Tusk' also brings to the table big slabs of body horror and the trope of the psychopathic captor. It's in the latter that this film finds its shining star, as Michael Parks is brilliant and morbid as odd, storied recluse Howard Howe. I regret to say that I haven't seen a great many of Parks' films, but just reflecting on his performance here, I kind of want to try to find more. He's creepy, and funny in a creepy way, but also creepily endearing in a funny way.I could remark on the camerawork, or the script, or the appearances by Johnny Depp, his daughter Lily-Rose, or Smith's daughter Harley Quinn. I could try to tell you whether it's good or bad, or give a recommendation. Yet everything about 'Tusk' is just rather overshadowed by how very, very odd it is. Those disparate elements of sparse offbeat humor and bizarre takes on horror tropes combine into a feature that is difficult to pin down in any shape or form except ""WALRUS.""If I had to give a definitive opinion on 'Tusk,' my first impulse is to be very middle of the road: I didn't dislike it, but I'm also hard-pressed to say I liked it - again, it's just so... odd. And it's that very quality of oddness that somewhat tips the scales for me to the negative side, because despite its best efforts, 'Tusk' gets so wrapped up in its own absurdity that it fails to give us much of any other reason to watch.Strangely, I recall 'Tusk' more fondly in hindsight than when I'd just finished watching.Recommended if you're a fan of Michael Parks, or if you specifically try to find the most strange of films. Otherwise, 'Tusk' is best approached with a very open mind and highly tempered expectations."
" Walrus or nothing!
",0.0,-0.9546,2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,One of the podcasters Wallace went to Canada to do an interview about the kill bill kid whom they find very amusing because he accidentally cut off his own leg on camera with a sword. He arrived to Winnipeg and saw the funeral of the guy who just took his own life with the very sword. Back home his girlfriend is cheating him with his podcaster friend Haley Joel Osmend because Wallace is being rude to her. He saw an ad at the bathroom of the bar and called the guy who says he has a lot of stories to tell because he was a sailor. Wallace arrived to his secluded house in the middle of nowhere. They sipped their teas and Wallace passed out and woke up to see himself on the wheelchair and one of his legs were amputated. He wanted to turn him into a walrus because he was saved by a walrus in a uninhabited island after their ship sank. Howard How's backstory was sad as he was an orphan and became a sailor to run away from people who abused him as a kid. He wanted to turn a person into a walrus because he had to kill and eat that savior walrus before they found him so he wanted to give a chance to him this time to fight for his life. They fought while the other two found the house with the detective thanks to the girls in the gas station. They fought like two walruses and Wallace as the Mr.Tusk killed him with his teeth which are actually his shin bones. Then they keep Wallace in an exotic animal house as a walrus and visited him with fish as a gift. It was such an original horror comedy with even touching moments. It was good to see Haley Joel and Johnny Depp as the weird funny detective.

He better stick to Horror and stop the lame Jay and Silent Bob reboots cause this sparked real terror...Just imagine if he took it 100% serious without the comedic approach. I actually felt bad for Justin Long, I would say the Walrus is even more unpleasant to look at than Jeepers Creepers. Die-hard horror fans who don't get gittery & cringey should watch this as a challenge. Show your mom and the last girl you made love with this film."

Of course it is a fun movie more than a serious horror film. But I got very bored. Bad dialogues. Actors were okay (Johnny Depp in his role of his life haha ) .
Definetly NOT a must watch."

" Disappointed in Justin Long
",-0.4767,-0.1406,2020-07-31 00:00:00,3,This movie had a good start. But half way through it got ridiculously stupid. I usually think Justin Long is such a good actor. I'm surprised he took this role after seeing the last 30-40 minutes of this movie.
" Wishing I Could Forget What I've Witnessed Today
",0.0,-0.8895,2020-07-29 00:00:00,2,"I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into, but I'm more traumatized than I expected - I feel this movie has impacted my soul. Bravo. I guess that's a tall order. I try to finish movies I start, attempting to appreciate a film as art, if nothing else. The Human Centipede thing crossed my mind as I watched (before I'd even read reviews calling that out). But also, it made me feel like I do when watching an ASPCA commercial in a lot of ways. Gut-wrenching, sickening, sad. The shrieks of Justin Long as a walrus will long echo in my nightmares. Also, did I seriously just watch Michael Parks get head from a walrus? I'm just... appalled. Michael Parks' acting was one redeeming quality, although I don't feel the acting in this movie was the problem, other than Johnny Depp, which I believe was purposefully bad acting, a crutch that Depp leans on time and time and time again, as evidenced by the fact that he's produced almost nothing good since his mouth was sewn shut in Edward Scissorhands (and okay, I love Dark Shadows too). I wanted to turn this off, but almost couldn't pull myself away, and then I suffered for it by not being able to eat lunch. So if that's what you're looking for, by all means..."

Tusk was, I'm assuming, very similar in a lot of ways to being diagnosed with some fatal illness where you have months to live, and in that miserable passage, the entire time, there is a little dancing showman to constantly laugh at you. I was so high watching this movie, and by the time I finished I felt like I had been clocked in the head, but am I also going to pretend like it WASN'T justifying what happened to Justin Long?

Those screams will shake anyones soul, so much so that I actually had to fastforward a bit thru them this time...more than I could take before bedtime, thats for sure! the acting was very good and the lead actor, once transformed, had to rely on his facial expressions and eyes and those cries to convey his state and it was painful to the extreme and heartbreaking at the same time...Im not going to say what horrors were done or what he went thru, no spoilers, just know that it was chilling and that it may stay with you long after the movie is over... this hits on a primal level, and affects you at ur core more than pretty much Any other horror movie I can think of...I see from some reviews that Some people actually felt it hilarious?? Well all I can say is there must be some seriously demented souls out there who get off on extreme human sufferring and indignity! There Are a few comedic moments in the film and Depp's character is one of them, but what justin long goes thru and his fate, is Anything but funny! Be prepared and be warned! Unforgettable Horror at its best that will leave a lasting Impression on ur mind!"

Scenes are either filled with way too much boring, pointless dialogue that does nothing to further the ""plot"" or endless screams from the main character. That's the whole movie.

Its refreshing to see something truly original, and something that is absolutely a one off film. The creativity in this movie is something we probably wont see again for awhile, not that thats a bad thing. At the end of the day, this is a movie about a ""walrus"" and the psycho who created it.

The pacing is kind of jarring, but it adds to the strange feeling this film give you. It's interesting to see such incredible acting in service of such an odd script. I truly believe and understand the characters, for a moment, but then everything crumbles. It crumbles right before your eyes, and the movie takes on a completely new shape, becomes a wholly new animal. The only thing that remains throughout is the very bizarre and deeply twisted sense of humor baked into the world's very foundation. It's so, so strange. I love strange films. I'm not sure if I love this film, but I did find it extremely fascinating, and that's probably a lot more important.
However, the jumbled pacing is a significant problem, and the film loses its steam in the final stretches, sort of rushing to an end that didn't feel terrobly climactic due to the directing. At least that's the feeling I had, and it left me unsatisfied.
But, again, this film was truly strange, and that is, to me, the greatest thing a film can be. Therefore, I believe this film is a success."

Then I saw this movie on a top 10 list on YouTube, and they showed the Wallace walrus. That made me want to watch it.I did like Human Centipede (the first one) because it was more of a drama and reminded me of Saw. Tusk is very similar to the former, but has a bit more backstory to it, and it is a lot more gruesome than HC. The walrus suit is so very disturbing.It's nothing amazing, but it was a fun watch. Very dark comedy with disturbing body horror. It's not for everyone, that's for sure. I wish the story after he was turned into the walrus was fleshed out a bit more, it seemed like it just hurried to have his friend and girlfriend find him, then that was it.Don't go in expecting this to be a serious movie or a masterpiece, just enjoy it for what it is, especially if you have a dark sense of humor or like messed up movies."

",-0.5423,-0.1699,2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,"There is a lot about this film that is quite wonderful. Parks is a just perfect in the role of the old misanthrope with a malevolent fixation on walruses. Depp shines as the bumbling French Canadian detective. Long is just right for the arrogant pod caster who gets what is coming to him. Several scenes-Howard and Wallace's first meeting, Guy and Howard being of note-are extremely pleasing. Sure some of this stuff, like the film itself, overstays its welcome. But Smith's dialog crackles as it always did and the characters are just so.But on the whole the film is rather misjudged. The second half is disturbing and gore filled in a way that the first half just doesn't set up. Wallace's fate is utterly creepy and several of the torture scenes are far harsher, vivid than the lighter comedy that comes before them. Part of this film just makes me feel terrible for Justin Long. I hope he was paid well.The film is striking and outside of Dogma it is Smith's most unique film. That aspect is a good thing."

No worries there, for a horror/comedy sort of movie, so we kept watching. At that point, we were thinking along the lines of, ""So, when does this character get what he deserves?"" But it's the audience who gets the short end of the stick here, and no one deserves to see a movie this BAD. Tacky isn't funny, characters you hate, when it's literally all of them, and a ""plot"" that makes less sense than a surreal dreamscape from psychedelic mushrooms (I can only guess) do not make for entertainment. There had to be some sort of drugs involved to make such a strange and senseless storyline. Senseless plot, no logic at all, tackiness pretending to be humor, and shock value pretending to be scares; no, just no. Not good, not entertaining, not thought provoking, just stupid. Worse that stupid. Anyone who claims to have enjoyed this movie needs a shrink. Seriously. If I knew someone who said they did, I'd cut off all relations with that person. Fast. I feel for any actor with a career so bad they had to be involved in such a movie. Well, almost. One name I saw in the cast listing, scrolling down to write this review, wow, what a nail n the coffin of a career. I have to note, too, the Netflix description LIES. They had description that sounds like some sort of fun creature feature, and that is NOT what you get. Avoid like the plague. Have a root canal, instead. Far less painful.

" Complete failure at comedy, horror, or anything inbetween
",-0.6705,-0.9455,2019-10-20 00:00:00,1,"Tusk is a film with a very quirky premise that should be fun, or eerie, or at least entertaining. A melancholy old man abducts a podcaster and surgically alters him to resemble a walrus, which he thinks is the world's finest creature. Anyone with half a brain could make this bizarre idea either really funny or really creepy; it would take a lot of incompetence to fail. Yet Kevin Smith and his hangers-on are clearly such a black hole of talent that they managed to fail dismally.The comedy is nonexistent. The movie throws in bad Canadian accents, an old guy saying ""poop hole"" and ""hyuk, Canadians like hockey a lot."" If you think that's side-splitting, then this movie was clearly made for you. The humor in this movie makes Family Guy look like comedic genius.Since the comedy is dead in the water, you'd think the movie would try to do something worthwhile on the horror element, but we are not so lucky. We're treated to the gimmick of a guy in a lame costume, and then... well, that's it. It's just scene after scene of a guy sitting around in a lame walrus costume while nothing interesting happens. At that point, it's clear that the creators knew they could make a lame, boring time-waster and still rake in a ton of cash thanks to Kevin Smith's name in the credits. Hurray for pop culture.The ""creative"" team was so lazy that they actually have to pad out the movie with tedious love triangle dreck about these characters we don't care about. It's nice knowing they spent millions of dollars to make this happen.So the content of the film is pathetic; how about the performances? Justin Long is just another limp-wristed white guy as our protagonist, and he spends half the movie in the stupid walrus costume. Nothing to see here. Michael Parks does the best he can as the villain. He has one great scene where he tells Long a made-up story about a poisonous spiderbite; in this scene, he is an unpredictable, compelling character. But outside of those 5 minutes, he just plays a generic crazy old guy who exposits a lot and sometimes makes lame literary references.Haley Joel Osmont plays a forgettable non-character, and Johnny Depp appears as a pointless detective with a ""hilarious"" accent like some amateur SNL comedian. Genesis Rodriguez stands out as the stinkiest log on this pile, appearing as the obligatory airbrushed girl who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Most of the actors are forgettable, and they clearly understand this movie isn't worth much effort. But Rodriguez is trying way too hard, and her godawful lack of any acting ability is painfully bad.I enjoy B movies and ""so bad they're good movies,"" but this one is just a time-waster. Don't watch this flick unless you want to see an interesting premise turned into a boring failure."
" Revolting, Tragic, Surreal, and Bloody Beautiful
",-0.25,0.7787,2019-10-19 00:00:00,9,"To be put into short words, this movie was horrific...in all the best ways.The seemingly hollowed and cheesed characters, the abrupt thematic and emotional shifts, the uncannily philosophical lashes on occasion, and the genuinely feverish antics that overcast the entirety of the film. This movie with mess with your head, yet make you to enjoy every second of it.Kevin Smith is able to drag the viewer down into the twisted, satirical ride of faux horror-comedy, and estranged occult madness. He does this while simultaneously producing a work that can snag the mind of the viewer, and shove it into a boiling pot of surreal mental disturbance, only to take it back out and sugar coat it with beautiful humor, drama, and amounts of sarcastic tone.The acting held by Justin Long was nothing short of an impressive surprise, casting forth rich humanizing emotion past his previously crude and apathetic self, as the mind of Wallace can be seen to deteriorate piece by piece through his torment. These factors are only amplified with the addition of Michael Park's outstanding performances. Himself being able to show Howard's intentions devolve, and have his dark past unfolded before the viewer in a sick concoction of memoir and nightmare.Overall, this movie is surprising, to say the least. I can guarantee you it is not perfect (and can also safely say you will not like yourself for watching it either). Yet, those flaws are highly outweighed by the obscure genius that lies in the ribald depths of this film's loudmouthed, contorted plot. From the raw characters, the tongue-in-cheek humor, the sickening effects, and almost completely convincing lore, Tusk is a revolting mind-game of b-horror that can't wait to drag you in."

" Justin Long is the walrus
",0.0,-0.4908,2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this movie for the second time and, despite the shock value of the first viewing being gone, I still thoroughly appreciated it after another look. I would in fact say I like this and director Kevin Smith's previous film, ""Red State,"" more than any of his Jay and Silent Bob flicks or anything else by him. There's a bit more going on here than merely crazy old guy kidnaps crappy young guy and renders him a monstrosity for his own sick and/or odd reasons. Justin Long is perfectly cast as a narcissistic sleaze and Michael Parks--one of the best character actors money could buy, before his death a few years ago--is too as an isolated psychopath who is perhaps not so much out of his gourd as not a fan of the human race and nostalgic for a happier time; a time spent decades earlier, with a walrus friend.Part of why I'd wanted to take this film in once more is because it's somewhat haunting. It's a unique nightmare, of the sort that could conceivably transpire, that lodges itself in one's mind. A fellow who (some might say accurately) regards human beings as the Earth's only real beasts, a man who was as a kid horribly abused and went through life with no one, without love or support, turns into a serial killer--hunted by a lone Canadian detective. But his aim seems to be less to inflict suffering as to turn man to animal, or rather the animal that man is into something superior to man: a, to his thinking, higher animal. And to do this so that he might relive, again (though fraudulently) experience, the six months during which he (allegedly) enjoyed the companionship of the marine creature that once saved him physically and then emotionally--the only time he knew connection.The film--or Parks' ""Howard Howe""--suggests that the modern person has lost much of his or her humanity (or never had much to begin with). And Long's character particularly has. But by being forcibly transformed into a walrus-person perhaps, it's also suggested, Long's Wallace Bryton ironically regains some measure of the humanity lost in the quest for success, to the distractions of the 21st century world, an amoral society. To a culture as cheap as the plastic convenience store cup that keeps reappearing, even long after he has come to look forward to meals of whole fish eaten off the ground."
" Kevin Smith does body horror.
",-0.5719,0.4371,2019-06-01 00:00:00,5,"Kevin Smith is a film-maker who has pretty much always done things his own way, building a rather unique and diverse filmography; Tusk is definitely one of his strangest efforts. It's a bizarre body-horror movie that sees a twisted Canadian serial killer called Howard Howe (Michael Parks) using makeshift surgery to turn brash American podcaster Wallace Bryton (Justin Long) into a walrus. The whys and wherefores I'll leave for you to discover, suffice to say that the film is totally insane.Unfortunately, as messed up as Tusk undeniably is, it's not one of Smith's better efforts: it's far fetched (albeit intentionally so), overly talky (as per every Smith movie), and at over 100 minutes, about 20 minutes too long. The dialogue isn't terrible - Smith is more than capable of writing witty conversation - but there's simply too much of it, and this causes the movie to drag. And as much as I admire make-up man Robert Kurtzman, his man-turned-walrus effects aren't among his best work.I'm glad that Smith is able to get such weirdness out of his system, and admire his willingness to explore material that most film-makers would leave well alone, but Tusk proves that if body horror is to be done by any Canadian, then that person should always be Cronenberg."

It was horrible, horrible, horrible. Oh, did I mention that it was horrible? Yeah ... it was HORRIBLE.Podcaster, Wallace Bryton (Justin Long), travels to Manitoba, Canada to interview someone known as the Kill Bill Kid, famous for severing his own leg with a samurai sword - however, upon arrival, he finds out that he'd committed suicide. So, not to waste his time or money for the trip, he decides to interview a retired seaman instead with the promise of free room and board in exchange for hearing his story. Bryton goes and has dinner with the old man - never to leave the house the same again.The first 30 minutes or so of this film was actually very good. It had my attention, it intrigued me and pulled me into the story. Up until the point where Bryton is drugged and the transformation from human to walrus begins. Then the movie, just plain and simply, became sick and disgusting. Michael Parks is one of those actors who isn't afraid to take a chance and as the disturbed seaman in this movie, he turns in his weirdest performance to date. I don't know how anyone in their right mind could be entertained by such filth.I highly recommend this movie ... for the incinerator. Throw it in the fire and let it burn.

""If you wish to continue living you will be a walrus or nothing at all"". Choose nothing, choose nothing!! For the love of God, choose nothing! How many dead walrus's are in that pool?? Sounds like a terrible joke. But this movie is no joke. It was quite disturbing that we were left with a unremitting frown of disgust and a lump in our throat making it unbearable to swallow.Podcaster Wallace Bryton sets out on a Canadian journey from Hell to interview loner Howard Howe. After being mysteriously ""bitten"" by a brown recluse spider, native to Canada (said sarcastically), Wallace wakes up only to soon discover his leg had been amputated. Howard is a strange man and we quickly learn his love for walruses, yup walruses. Howard has plans, including patterns, to turn Wallace into a human walrus, tusks and all. Similar to everyone's favorite horror film, The Human Centipede.Wallace Bryton, the comical quirky podcaster, reluctantly becomes Wally the walrus, or in Howard's eyes the love and savior of his life, the one and only Mr. Tusk. We just can't even make this up. Luckily, Haley Joel Osment (yup, the Sixth Sense kid) is Wallace's podcast partner and he is all too familiar with this type of mystery and comes to the rescue with Ally, Wallace's girlfriend. We're surprised the dead walrus's at the bottom of the pool didn't speak to him, that seems like something that could have happened. Wallace's friends come to the rescue just as he's using his newly created tusks to stab crazy Howard. #Nightmaresfordays.
Although this movie is a disturbing twist of The Human Centipede and Lewis Carroll's The Walrus and the Carpenter, it falls short of being successful. Maybe next time, just don't. Oh and bonjour Mr. Depp - looking dapper.Most likely to make swim team captain: Wallace, Wally the Walrus, Mr. Tusk - how did he not drown??Best Monster: Mr. Tusk wins again, you were terrifying!Most resourceful: Howard Howe - I mean he figured out how to make walrus tusks from human leg bones.Overall Grade: W"

I found it obvious, so I'm a bit shocked with the reviews indicating this wasn't a comedy or horror flick, which is accurate and I don't understand the expectation that it was supposed to be. The movie depicts society well. His original trip to Canada was for a nod to people living on the internet and often laughing at other's misfortunes. Karma caught him and he's now the butt of the joke. Then you have the story tellers between Howe and the detective, which is what the lead was supposed to do, bring back the story after the trip.

The direction is really good especially because Kevin Smith proves that he doesn't have to work on some sort of stoner comedy or romantic comedy. This is Kevin Smith's second horror movie and it is much closer to a horror comedy in a sense but it turned out great. I am not sure any other director could successfully make this movie. The screenplay also by Kevin Smith is fresh and original which is something I haven't come across in a long time. The casting and acting are really good especially by Justin Long as the Pod caster and Michael Parks as the mysterious person to be interviewed: All in all I would u-give this five out of a possible five stars.

Not only are these two spiders very distinct from one another, but neither occur in Manitoba (where most of the film is set). Further, the spider is referred to as an ""insect"" which is simply preposterous.If you can get over this biological problem, the movie will make you say ""ort ort ort"" all the way to the nearest raw mackerel."

" First half works as a dark comedy - better than expected!
",0.69,0.8282,2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't sure what to rate this film. I'd like to rate it higher because the first half was just a great dark comedy thanks to Michael Parks' character, the madman who wants to turn his victim into a walrus. The character's mockery of his victim and the back and forth from comedy to suspense is just brilliantly delivered. Kevin Smith takes the standard horror cliche, ""Unsuspecting fool stumbles into a madman's mansion,"" and makes it feel fresh. You hate the main character, but find him humorous. There are moments where you feel sorry for him, but then the movie takes you back to comedy. You constantly say to yourself, ""this is ridiculous"" but I couldn't help watching until the end. I watched The Human Centipede a few years ago hoping for a monster movie, one that could satisfy my curiosity for body horror but also make me laugh to myself, ""this is ridiculous."" But as a 20-year-old woman, what started as shock-horror quickly turned into depressing, and I shut it off halfway. I didn't wanna watch people cry in a cage and swallow each other's feces, i wanted what movies like The Fly and The Thing gave us in the 80's-90's. I wanted to be fascinated and entertained! Not being familiar with Smith's work other than Clerks & Clerks II, I worried that this film would only serve to disturb and shock. I worried it would be perverted or gory for the sake of being gory. This film really didn't take anything too far, and at the same time they showed enough to satisfy this curiosity.The second half, though, really took a direction into comedy/drama. When Johnny Depp's character arrived, I recognized his quirks but didn't realize it was him at first. I felt confused by the obvious change in tone. Despite a few flaws though, the end of the film was wrapped up nicely - sort of a cliche drama, but there was definitely underlying humor in seeing the walrus in captivity(reminds me of the ending of Freaks...but with some added heart.) All-in-all, Tusk was better than I thought it would be. I don't think a movie with such an odd premise has a chance at being a 10/10 comedy or horror, but Kevin Smith somehow made it work in both genres for me."

Some worse than others..but sometimes, you can't help but feel bad for the ones who plead for their lives or freedom, and whom are denied that right. It's freakishly demented, one that is difficult to stomach. I don't think I've ever seen a film in which the original ""bad guy"" is the one punished by a second, and it's a lose-lose situation. One in which the end of the movie will almost have you fighting back tears. I've always loved monster movies, and if you're looking for some kind of horror/creature feature type movie...well that's not exactly what this is. Its a lot deeper than that."

If there is not a documentary on the making of this film I would like to make one because the performance alone of Justin Long is Oscar worthy. I put myself in the same twisted situation and feel I could have not in real life acted better than him. He has now risen to the top 5 of acting of all time only as no one else could pull off this role I'm sure of that. Along with some incredible monologues and a Johnny depp performance that was necessary to my enjoyment of the movie but further enhanced it I have to give the film tusk a hands down 10.

And if they want to flash forward, why not him working at a exotic pet exhibit. He may not be able to walk or talk, but it could be a volunteer thing or he could be behind the scenes working...but to assume he is a walrus just because he physically was turned to one doesnt mean he should be left to live the life of one. Lmao. And why did the guy even pull his gun up? What was the real reason for that..just to cut away...

'The Human Centipede' because I knew that that kind of movie was not for me.The main character is turned into some disgusting kind of walrus made from human flesh. The only part of the movie that was enjoyable was the acting of Justin (before he was a walrus) and Michael Parks who really carried the movie. I also enjoyed the part where the walrus exacts his revenge on his creator in the last 15 minutes or so."

There is so many good stories and horror/gore flix, don't waste your time. The beginning is ever so slightly funny but mostly crude. I thought it might get better but it just got worse and the ending was boring, unsatisfying and awkward. But what can you expect from a gore movie?

I didnt particularly enjoy the film personally, but it does what it set out to do. Its deranged, its grotesque, its bizarre beyond belief. And I think that is why it probably didnt do as well in the box office....its gonna be one of those films that performed poorly in revenue but years later down the road it will become a cult classic.

I'm not a huge body modification horror film person, but this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen; however, I don't think I'd watch this again.

I avoided ever watching movies like 'The Human Centipede', 'Hostile', etc. You catch my drift. I watched it because it was under 'the ""psychological thriller"" category on Netflix, and I love those. Totally wrong description, though. The reason I stuck through it, although it was hard to watch, was because of the impeccable acting. I found it odd that he actually gets treated like an animal in the end. He even lived at the zoo. The writer was reaching too much at that point when you thought he could reach no further. It ended ridiculously. I would've rated it higher if he would've died by either committing suicide or just letting the psycho finish him off. He was so disfigured that he could never go back.

I'm gonna check out Yoga Hosers soon, but as for this one: I liked it, and it was different than I expected which is really why I give it the high rating, because I also found that it dipped a bit in certain parts and around the halfway mark you start kind of wondering what exactly you're waiting around for because it feels like what you might worry about happening has already happened.

But all I'm going to say is the girlfriend choosing the protagonists lifestyle at the end of the film, do to his inability to speak, is a CRAZY ILLEGAL CHOICE. It says it takes place a year after the incident but regardless, the protagonists wounds are still bleeding. The latex is shown coming off in multiple scenes when wet, and for some reason Johnny depps character has no further role past a massive cliff hanger at the second to last scene! What was that about?

I will say that Justin Long really carried the movie well, and it was sort of an interesting thing to see him in a movie as bizarre as this turned out to be. But the icing on the cake had to be Johnny Depp's character and his performance, that was just hilarious. But it was also a rather good performance by Michael Parks, although it was far from being the crowning achievement of his entire acting career.The walrus creature, however, looked so horribly fake that it just didn't work out for the movie. It was laughable to look at, and it was so difficult to take it serious in any possible means. And the way that one would isolate oneself and assume the demeanor of an animal just didn't make much sense to me.""Tusk"" is hardly the type of movie that you will watch more than once, because the storyline and the movie itself just doesn't have enough material to support more than a single viewing."

" Well, that was a surprise!
",0.5411,0.9802,2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I had given up hope of ever seeing a Kevin Smith movie that didn't annoy me. Thus, I didn't see this until quite recently, on the suggestion of reliable movie nerds. And I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised.I have seen movies with a similar premise; a person is trapped with a lunatic (Creep, and Misery, for example), or persons in the same situation (The Human Centipede, and Split), but unlike those movies, this one does things right. It keeps the perfect balance between humor, drama, and horror. And unlike most movies in this genre, the focus is not on the gore and sadism (like the Human Centipede). Instead we have a villain that I could not help but feel for, in-between the utter insanity of Michael Parks' character. As for the actors, I have never been a fan of Justin Long (which was another reason why I didn't want to see this movie), but he did a very good job! And Michael Parks is absolutely brilliant. Without his performance the movie would not have been half as good. Haley Joel Osment and Genesis Rodriguez are giving very convincing performances. In fact, the only actor that I didn't like was Johnny Depp, who seemed to under the impression that this was one of Smith's adolescent comedies (and Smith clearly didn't correct him). In fact, had Johnny Depp not brought the movie down with his ridiculous overacting, I may have pushed the rating up a star. It was almost embarrassing to see him try to perform whatever he was doing, and whatever it was it was far from convincing, and honestly, I think the character does very little for the story. He only tells the audience what we had already figured out, or didn't need to know. So give it a chance. It certainly is not as bad as so many here have claimed."

Which is what happens in this movie.This movie is fine and funny until we see that sad Walrus costume -Power Rangers had better costumes-, after you see that, you have no other choice to ask yourself, why I'm watching this?You could argue that the crappy costume was intentional -which I do believe-, but the tone change on the movie -from comedy to grotesque suspense- push you out from the dramatic universe of the film, shutting down your disbelief and had you thinking; ""That costume doesn't produce chills, neither is funny"" Which at the end of the day, achieving that mixture was the main -failed- goal of the director."

I thought I knew exactly what to expect from those two, but I was so wrong. This has no similarity with anything any of them ever did. IMDb says comedy, drama, horror, and although it has elements of each, I can not agree with that classification. True, there's humor, but if you are in for a comedy, you're in for extremely unpleasant surprise. Although it has elements of eighties B horror, this movie is not scary. It won't frighten you or keep you tense, but most of it is both psychologically and visually unpleasant. And whether you will characterize it as a drama, I think it depends on your subjective experience. It's surreal, awkward, nasty and sick.

There are a number of humorous scenes that worked and some of the humor grew tiresome such as the poorly scripted Guy Lapointe (Johnny Depp) character. The flashback scenes attempted to create a story that had meaning, but fell short.

" Odd, grotesque, unnecessary weirdness
",-0.4939,0.9908,2018-01-02 00:00:00,3,"What. The. Hell? That pretty much sums up 'Tusk'. It's basically a ""trapped with someone evil"" horror movie, with some Kevin Smith humour thrown in here and there. Sure, there's some laughs, but they're mostly incredulous. Now, I'm a pretty big fan of Smith's and I used to listen to SModCast (but haven't heard the one this was based on) and I've seen all his films and stand-up DVDs. But even still, this has to be the worst thing he's done. I admire him for taking a risk and doing something unexpected, but 'Red State' was at least new, exciting and inventive. 'Tusk', not so much.Before this turns into a total bagging, let me point out some of the pros - the score is great, the use of Fleetwood Mac's 'Tusk' (""don't say that you love me!"") is pretty great and fitting in its scene and some of the language and nuances that Parks uses are fantastic. Depp is also pretty funny as the unrecognisable (thanks to a fake nose and, I think, contacts) detective.But it's just hard to ignore the total and complete nonsensicalness. Why is it set in Winnipeg, Canada, but filmed in North Carolina, USA? Why would Parks leave the phone lying around for Long to find? How is Parks supposed to be 90+ when he's only 74? Why do we need to see Joel Osment & Rodriguez pretty much talking to the camera when Long's not there, adding nothing to the story? Why does Parks do what he does? There's no real motivation there. Why does none of the plot make sense? Why do we need over half of the movie being exposition before anything happens? All I'll say is, see it if you're curious, but be prepared to be grossed out and simultaneously underwhelmed."

The film is original, even bizarre, but it cannot in fact be considered a horror movie, and anyone who does it must be deeply easy to scare. It doesn't scare anyone, although its provocative and has strong scenes. The script is based on a podcaster's trip to Canada, where he meets an old sailor who is actually a psychopath obsessed with walruses. But the biggest problem is that the film seems only interested in provoking, not in accomplishing something. It's not a comedy, it's not a horror movie, it could never be a thriller because we can predict everything that will happen with great ease... I just don't know how to rate this movie.Kevin Smith is far from a good director and this film only served to solidify the certainty that he doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. The construction of the script fails in many ways, none of the characters goes beyond the caricature, the performance of the actors is also a caricature of themselves. The only exception is Michael Parks who, with a generally good and somewhat serious interpretation, prevented the film from completely sinking in the mud and didn't allowed me to give up watching it. About Johnny Depp ... I'm just not surprised to see him here because he's gotten used to expecting anything from him."
" Skin I Live In
",0.0,0.3937,2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"While on assignment in Manitoba, an American pays a late night visit to wheelchair-bound war veteran with devious plans in this horror film from Kevin Smith. 'Tusk' has been compared to 'The Human Centipede', but it more heavily resembles 'The Skin I Live In', and the less else said about the plot the better to avoid ruining a fresh experience. Whatever the case, the first half is compelling stuff. Justin Long plays such an arrogant jerk that one almost wonders if he deserves his fate, and yet Smith carves a sympathetic enough character that we feel for him during his strife. Michael Parks though is the actor who steals the show as the war veteran whose poetic eloquence and charisma (waxing poetic about the sea) makes him all the more chilling as he goes about discussing his surgical plans for Long with a straight face. Learning of his struggles, he is oddly sympathetic too. The second half of the film is not quite so strong though with lots of time spent away from Parks and Long as two friends investigate his disappearance and encounter an over-the-top caricature of a French detective, played by Johnny Depp. This in turn renders 'Tusk' more of a comedy than sad horror film, which doesn't quite seem like the right note to end on. Obviously, Smith is having a lot of fun with his material, but a less comedic approach to the tale may have well made it more haunting."
" A serial killer, a victim and a search party
",-0.5719,0.6047,2017-07-14 00:00:00,4,"The film is based on an idea from a Kevin Smith podcast (we hear it during the credits) which is meant as a joke. It is actually the final scene of this movie.There are actually 3 stories in that movie:1. The story of a serial killer. It's the best story of the three. You learn why he's doing what he's doing and you feel for the character and all he went through in his life. He feels all humans are monsters, including himself and wants to correct all that. Yes, he turns out to be weird and crazy to a shocking point. The character is along the line of Dr. Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lamb"". Relating his story to actual events helps the viewer connecting with the character (The ""Duplessis Orphans"" are real, as described in the movie).2. The story of a victim. The movie begins with this story presenting us a person that most of us would consider a monster by the way he chose to live his life. Still, we feel for him and we don't think he deserves whatever happens to him as the plot unfolds. The story is well told by the use of flashback. In a certain way, we can see this character evolving (forcefully), realizing in the end he might be a better person as a ""friendly form of life"" and as a ""monster killer"" than as being the ""monster"" he used to be. Too bad the ending of this story (which is the ending of the movie and the original idea behind the movie) is presented in such a ridiculous way. What was meant to be funny, well, it just doesn't work with the rest of this story. It leaves you confused about a character that you began to feel something for. That last scene could've been told in a more serious and realistic manner to help the viewer connect even more with the main character.3. The search party story. The first half of the movie is only about stories 1 & 2 and the viewer is deeply involved in the plot. Then we began to see the story about the search party for the victim (the girlfriend, the best friend and a retired cop). We are in for ridiculous and unrealistic situations and characters without depth. Especially the retired cop which could be a character on ""Dumb and dumber"" as he is such a caricature. This story brings nothing to the movie and could be completely removed with no consequences. Most of it was meant to be funny, which wasn't reaching me at all. I guess it's the type of humour that can only be enjoyed while high.In retrospect, it's an horror movie in the sense that you will see disturbing images, but there are no scary scenes. If someone finds humour in this movie, I find it very thin, and other Kevin Smith's movies are much better examples for this purpose. I wish Kevin Smith would have shown more of the transformation process (physically and mentally) instead of the search party story. We would have connected even more with the main characters and feel their pain.The ending and the search party story really killed the movie, thus the low rating."
" A very confused film...
",-0.3804,-0.7785,2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"Smith really needs to calm it down with the old weed intake, as we all know every idea is a great idea when you're high as f#!k, unfortunately, Smith seems to have forgotten this, most likely because he's high as f#!k.The film doesn't know what it wants to be the mix of horror, parody & drama just doesn't work at all, it's just a very confused movie it takes itself seriously yet it wants to be funny it just doesn't work, like Rachel's Trifle there'll always be someone out there that likes it, but I am not one of these people.Smith, lay off the weed and you might stop running with crap ideas.

" not at all so bad !!
",-0.7249,0.7307,2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I find this movie full of drama and the acting is very good. it is an-unusual movie maybe a little strange bud not for long so bad as all you Americans find the film. i had some moments of intense horror and i Don't have that often. I like Justin Long in this role, i don't think its ease to play . And i loved the black comedy in it. Am i really the only one who likes this movie??."
" disgusting
",-0.5267,-0.6202,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"I have just created this account to comment on this movie. DO NOT watch it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so disgusting, after watching it I don't want to eat anything. I would definitely recommend it to someone I hate. And now I have to write 5 whole lines about this movie so my review can be posted, but it sucked so much that i don't know what else to write. I watched it because Johny Depp was playing, but I think this was just a bait, because without him no one would see this movie to the end"
" Human Centipede. Canadian.
",0.0,0.7601,2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"Let me be clear from the get go: I didn't like it. The problem, as far as I was concerned, was that captivity and body horror require a certain type of mood while Canadian self deprecating comedy requires another. It isn't like a horror movie with some comic relief sprinkled in, it is not a dark comedy, it's like someone butchered a horror and a comedy into an unholy hybrid to soothe their twisted psyche. I also feel that the very ending spoiled whatever pleasure I took from the film.I liked the acting and I think that they made a really good effort with the special effects and the sets and everything. I also found interesting, although not all original, the idea to have a completely unlikable character as the victim, only to show that they were not that bad in the first place.If you are satisfied with the story and plot, then there is no reason not to like this film. Unfortunately for me, I didn't like them."
" Gross but kinda a fascinating
",0.5041,0.848,2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"This is a brutally gross film so I understand those that do not like it at all since it reminds them films like ""Human Centipede."" I have watched this film a few years back not really liking it and now feeling like it serves as one of those films you can't take too seriously but can't look away from because it too bizarre.Justin Long stars as Wallace, the main protagonist, along with Haley Joel Osmont as Teddy, two friends who run a podcast making fun of others for fun and money. Due to their many misadventures Wallace goes to Canada to find material for one of his bits for his podcast only to comes up empty handed. That is until Wallace reads Michael Parks's letter on a bathroom wall looking for a lodging partner which takes us into what becomes of Justin Long.Michael Parks does a good job playing the ""crazy old man with an obsession"", pretty much the only things that stands out in this film. Kevin Smith does a good job of taking a strange part of his life and making it rather sick. The movie reminds you of ""The Fly"" in that it transforms someone from one level of a human being to the extreme.It isn't horror movie I'd love for the ages but once in a while if you want to fill that nasty, putrid part of your life then I guess this is the movie for it.**SPOILER** ending leaves wondering how is Wallace still alive?! He would of died of infection either that or god take him out of his misery."
" Great horror comedy if you understand that its COMEDY
",0.7297,0.9849,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"OK so i see a lot of hate for this movie and its clear most people don't understand it. Its a comedy. Its very good at what its trying to do. My wife and i were in tears laughing at this movie, we thought it was one of the funniest we have seen in years. If you like horror comedy than this is for you. If you have a weak sense of humor or are easily grossed out don't even bother. You ll just add to the perception that its not a good movie which isn't true. Just don't take it seriously like the idiots around here and you'll love it. God i saw one review complaining about how the end could never legally happen. Duh. Its a joke. Great movie. 10/10 if your not an idiot."
" Modern classic horror comedy
",-0.296,0.6959,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Its a really good horror comedy, judging by the reviews it just hasn't found its audience yet. A lot of Kevin Smith fans are clearly disillusioned with his more recent turn towards horror comedy. There are very few decent horror comedies being made these days with decent acting, tight stories and scripts; this is one of them. Personally I found it refreshing and original. Not for the squeamish though as it is ridiculously morbid. Michael Parks does a great job acting his part as Howard Howe, as does the other lead actor Justin Long. The script is what really carries the whole thing. In a comedy sfx etc always comes secondary to acting and script, so it doesn't really matter if the effects aren't really great, in fact it puts the audience at ease, allowing them to not take the film so seriously and gross out."
