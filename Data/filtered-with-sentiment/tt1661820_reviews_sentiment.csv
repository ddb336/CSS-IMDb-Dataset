" Quirky and dark
",0.0,0.985,2021-04-06 00:00:00,9,"I waited a while to watch Cutbank because it didn't get good reviews. I found it to be much better than the reviews I read. It is definitely reminiscent of ""Fargo,"" but still retains its own character. Liam Hemsworth is just okay, but imo, his rather bland character is the perfect palette for the rest of the cast to play off of. Between the winding, interesting plot, quirky characters, and clever dialogue, I found this to be an entertaining movie to watch. I definitely recommend it!"
" A Quirky Plan
",0.0,0.9888,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"A lot of the critics and reviewers referenced the Cohen Brothers in reviewing this film, but I saw more similarities to Sam Rami's 'A Simple Plan.' The acting is first rate, with one exception, headed by John Malkovich, who stripped bare his performance and produced a gem. Michael Stuhlbarg is a terrific character actor with a great range. Bruce Dern is at his quirky best and Billy Bob Thornton is effectively surprising. The exception is Liam Hemsworth, who is not very good. Channing Tatum, Taylor Kitsch or Joseph Gordon-Leavitt would have beautifully rounded-out this excellent cast. Kudos to Director Matt Shakman and music by James Newton Howard."
" Like an episode of ""Twin Peaks"" but not a good one...
",-0.3311,-0.2966,2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Matt Shakman's ""Cut Bank"" is like the episode of ""Twin Peaks"" that got away; it's just too weird to dismiss out of hand and too lacking in substance to take seriously. I suppose you could describe it as American Gothic and its director did indeed direct an episode of that series and this too might have made a decent episode of a television series like ""Fargo"", (something else Shakman worked on), but there isn't enough here for a feature film despite a cast that includes Bruce Dern, John Malkovitch, Michael Stuhlbarg and Oliver Platt. It's also not helped in that the lead is Liam Hemsworth, arguably the least talented of that trio of acting brothers.Cut Bank itself is one of those American small towns about the size of a pinhead and one the world has obviously forgotten about and where a murder can be inadvertently filmed without anyone really batting an eye. It's also the kind of place David Lynch would feel very much at home in. It's redeemed in part by Dern, Malkovitch and Stuhlbarg all at their daft best but God only knows what audience it was intended for; neither mainstream nor art-house, it might make for a passable midnight matinee."
" Good movie... but totally copycat.
",0.2382,0.8485,2020-10-26 00:00:00,6,"If you haven't seen Fargo you might think that many of the tidbits are quirky, original thoughts, but if you get out a pen and paper and throughout the movie write down the Fargo parallels, you lose a little respect for the filmmakers. Start with title ( town name), then the scenes of the iconic town statues, then the policeman/woman vomiting at the sight of dead bodies... and that's just the beginning. Yet, with Bruce Dern in top form and other fine actors, I did enjoy the movie. I hope they share royalties with the Coen brothers."
" Some enjoyable performances, adequate plot and pacing
",0.5859,0.9517,2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,"The familiar plot is respectfully played, and the whole shebang is unobjectionable entertainment.Malkovich, Thornton, and Dern provide a bit of fun here, while the supporting players are fine, tooThe young Teresa Palmer later moves up to ""Discovery of Witches"" which was clever and entertaining until it fell apart."
" Very Fargoesque !!
",0.0,0.9786,2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Excellent film with outstanding cast. Black humour throughout just like the Coen Bros movies. Good story, well directed and excellent cinematography.I'd recommend it and it's an easy 7 edging towards 8."
" Great movie!
",0.6588,-0.4601,2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Although Liam is a terrible, terrible actor, the superstar cast made the difference.
Really good Red Neck Flick."
" watch Fargo (the movie) instead.
",0.0,-0.25,2020-07-31 00:00:00,4,"If u like sleepy town movies involving crime and con artistry, watch fargo instead"
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.7964,2020-07-01 00:00:00,2,Horrible acting all around. The character Derpy Milton was ridiculous. A lot the of the cut shots were unnecessary and did nothing to add to the movie.
" We're gonna be fine, we're gonna be fine...
",0.2023,-0.5067,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"So as they're getting plastic bags put over their head and taped around their neck Hemsworth keeps repeating to his girlfriend who is suffocating ""we're gonna be fine, we're gonna be fine""... which is just stupid and annoying! Who wrote that garbage?!Still 6 stars for the big name cast that are usually always enjoyable to watch.. especially Malkovich!"
" Not buying the ""bad guy"" in this movie...
",0.431,-0.9087,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"I just don't for one minute buy the villain bad guy in this movie! The dude is scrawny and possesses no physically dominant attributes which would explain him overpowering people half his age and twice his size! That wasn't realistic at all and neither was the acting from Hemsworth. He looked like an amateur compared to the rest of the big name cast...At the end, Hemsworth couldn't warn his girlfriend who was walking through the house and about to fall right into the hands of this bad guy? He just lets her walk right into a gun pointed at her head? That was stupid... I hate dumb $hit like that! Ruins movies for me and then I hope for them to get killed!Still a pretty good movie that is worth the watch..."
" Not too bad... didn't all add up tho!
",0.0,0.9795,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"This was a very watchable movie. Had a great big name cast but I'm with some of the other reviewers about how terrible Hemsworth acting is in this movie. He certainly seems like the odd man out. Also, like some other reviews... It made no sense how the little scrawny taxidermist guy was able to go around and physically overpower as many people as he did. What was he, 55 yrs old, 5'9 and 140 lbs (?) and somehow he's taking down people twice his size? That kind of unrealistic nonsense is hard to overlook and ignore. The native guy is 6"" taller and pretty ripped, the bartender was half his age and built... come on Hollywood, be realistic! I know I know... that's never your forte!
Anyway, pretty decent entertaining movie with a good plot twist and some great actors. I never felt like turning it off or fast forwarding which is rare for me. That must be a good sign..."
" General agreement
",0.4939,0.0014,2020-06-15 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed this film and of course its similarities to Fargo are clear. I saw the latter many years ago so so my memory is dim. Hemsworth is an actor who has come this far on his looks, he is a dull character but maybe he is supposed to be. His girlfriend obviously deserves much better but not spoilt for choice in a nowhere town like Cut Bank, The one thing that disturbed me is how Derby managed to kill Hatch who was bigger, younger and stronger than he was. Also we never found out what was in the parcel and why it was so important"
" A good little thriller
",0.4601,-0.3279,2020-05-27 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this film. I wasn't expecting great things based on reviews but actually I liked it a lot. Strangely despite a great cast it very much feels like a classic B Movie. Certainly not the best film the actors have been in, but still very watchable."
" Wasn't a bad movie!!
",0.5321,0.5163,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"It was ok to watch, but I wouldn't want to watch it again. There's more excitment in an old age home than what's going to happen in this movie. I never seen a movie with Billy bob Thornton in it yet, that was any good and how this man still gets calls to act is beyond me!!! I'd rather get kicked in the nuts twice rather than watch this movie again!!"
" Oh so bad
",-0.5849,-0.8845,2020-04-06 00:00:00,1,Great cast for the most part (except Liam) but terrible storyline. Very slow and boring. Then turns creepy and weird. Then boring again.
" Great cast. Best film I've seen in a while.
",0.8519,0.9837,2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"If you're looking for fast paced thrills, this isn't it. This is a slow-burner with some real Hollywood muscle, featuring Billy Bob Thornton, John Malkovich, Bruce Dern and
Oliver Platt. The later two play it up especially well, adding some low key humor to the mix. The entire cast does a stellar job and the characters are solid and well developed. Though it's just a supporting character, Derby Milton is the center of it all. Derby Milton wants his parcel! I can't help wanting to know more about him. What's he all about? How does such a socially awkward, geeky little guy physically manage himself as well as he does? A former green beret perhaps? It seems unlikely. We never get to know. I also can't ignore the similarities in appearance to the Milton character from Office Space (Derby's last name.) Coincidence? Intentional? There are a few subtle running gags in the movie, one of which has various characters stating ""Derby Milton. I thought you was dead,"" when he walks into a room. We don't get to find out why everyone seems to think he's dead. I have to assume his reclusive lifestyle has something to do with it. A couple of other entertaining tidbits involve the sheriff. He at times doesn't seem to have the stomach for his work, which made me chuckle. The other being the cruiser number of his police car. Don't misunderstand where I'm going. This isn't a comedy. It does however contain some smart, very subtle humor. Aside from that, it's a well written, intelligent crime-who done it kind of story, with plenty to entertain and keep it's audience engaged. One of the better movies I've seen in a while."
" I have no idea why this only has a rating of 6
",-0.296,0.9442,2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"I didn't have high expectations going in to this due to the rating but I ended up truly enjoying this film. Great cast, plot twists, and suspenseful till the end."
" Quirky
",0.0,0.8225,2020-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Well written, well directed off beat comedy in the Cohn brother's style. Enjoyable."
" Believability kills this.
",-0.5423,-0.4255,2020-01-21 00:00:00,4,"Decent film and acting and plot and everything but it just kills me that the main ""bad guy"" is a mediocre sized man that shows no particularly high levels of intelligence can out smart and out muscle people more clever than him and sometimes twice his size. He frequently overpowers/chokes people clearly much bigger and stronger than him with some type of ridiculous plot armor that it kills any thing this film had going for it, not to mention his very thinly laid out backstory that simply reveals he is kinda weird."
" Had potential before the Hollywood plot twist. Spoilers
",0.0,-0.802,2020-01-20 00:00:00,3,Starts off as a murder mystery with turns Into a get rich scheme gone wrong. Then for some insane reason a character that is supposed to be smart starts killing the conspirators because he didn't get his package. A waste of time pure and simple waste of a great cast that if they had been given anything good to do could have made a classic.
" A Simple Plan redux
",0.0,0.9692,2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"After reading the reviews, I didn't think this would be a very good movie. This had an excellent story and a superb cast all around. I could see a little of the movie Fargo in it but it reminded me more of the movie A Simple Plan. I love this movie. I also liked the actor Michael Stuhlburg who went to my alma mater as a ""cherub"". I have to award this an 7.5-8."
" Who talks like this?
",0.3612,0.6486,2019-12-24 00:00:00,6,I would've given it 8 stars but couldn't see past Hemsworth's wooden treatment and the way these people talk. Too much forced noir from the writer clashing against the backdrop of plain Jane small town setting. Otherwise it was a great plot and directed well.
" Twin Peaks meets Corner Gas
",0.0,0.9719,2019-12-24 00:00:00,7,"I don't usually look at reviews before watching a movie, but I was going to watch this with people who get bored easily, so I decided to take a peek. 6 and above out of 10 is a fair assessment. The movie starts off slow, but after the characters and motivations are established, the suspense kicks in and it does pull you in the story effectively. It was well-acted and the character Derby Milton...I don't know who plays him, but he really gave the character life and gave it an almost a cult-like status. The movie itself had a Twin Peaks vibe in terms of how quirky it is with dark undertones. Overall, I agree with reviewers who praised the script. It didn't knock my socks off or anything, but I haven't been seeing too many movie like this in theatres nowadays. Happy to have given this one a try."
" Create the Screenwriter
",0.2732,0.8172,2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,Beautifully paced narrative with engaging characters and surprising turns. Patino really gave the director and the actors something to sink their teeth into. Thumbs way up!
" Chaos theory on murder
",-0.8555,-0.9645,2019-12-11 00:00:00,7,"This film is surprisingly fun. But as any murder can go, a planned out murder at that, just think about Murphy's law, what can wrong will go wrong. And it did ;-)"
" Great story. Wonderful Dark Comedy
",0.8834,0.9761,2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,"We loved this movie. Great story, unique dialog. Loved the Sheriff, Postal Inspector, and many others. The conversations were well thought out, unique, and fun. I hope this crew gets together again.
""Did you know hospitals have the best peach cobbler?"""
" Not too bad
",0.431,0.3071,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"If you go in not taking this too seriously, this is a film worth a watch. A dark comedy/crime/psycho killer story with some great performances from an all star cast. Yes, it's bit over the top but that was intentional as I see it."
" Engaging in spite of its derivative premise
",-0.25,0.8509,2019-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Yes, Cut Bank is reminiscent of the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple and Fargo, as innumerable critics have pointed out. But it has enough originality and surprise to keep you watching.
It also obviously has a stellar cast. Dern, Malkovich, Thornton, Stuhlbarg, and Platt do their best to make their characters real. Malkovich and Platt are especially good.My gripes are not so much about the derivative nature of the film. I have two: 1) What's up with the lunchbox? It's the McGuffin of the plot, so why are we not informed about its relevance? 2) The ending is a surprise, but afterward, I couldn't help but wonder why the sheriff did what he did."
" ""But you're alive. And I can't afford to be seen not dead.""
",0.5267,0.737,2019-09-24 00:00:00,6,"This is the kind of film that starts out with a compelling and interesting opening, but then, when you know what the scam is behind the principal character's actions, you have to wonder to yourself - how the heck did the guy ever think he was going to pull it off? Because just about everything in the story defies credibility, and it's only the peculiar characters that keep you invested in the story. Like the silent Blackfoot, Match Tasunke (David Burke), who wasn't around long enough to figure in the resolution; I would like to have seen more of him, especially after playing tag with the reservation kids. And what about that creepy Derby Milton, frighteningly portrayed by Michael Stuhlbarg. I had to get a kick out of every time he came up against someone who gave him some grief, using that Iron Claw hold to the throat, in the grand tradition of pro wrestler Fritz Von Erich. Personally I couldn't see how he could have been that powerful, but sometimes you can't account for a crazed man's strength. Probably the best bad performance that was pretty good would have been Miss Cut Bank winner, Cassandra Steeley (Teresa Palmer). If she sang that terrible on purpose I'd say she was a good actress, although something tells me that her voice might just have been awful for real. But who am I to criticize, I have an even worse singing voice.The old pros here held up their end well, but just like Native American Match, Billy Bob Thornton's character, Big Stan Steeley wasn't around very long. John Malkovich as Sheriff Roland Vogel smelled a rat throughout his investigation of the alleged murder of George Wits (Bruce Dern), and the way he made peace for the town of Cut Bank and the hapless schemer Dwayne McLaren was an inspiration coming out of left field. As for that lunch pail Derby was so hot to trot about - it had as much connection to the plot as that old photo the Sheriff carried around with him of an old flame inscribed with 'Find me someday, Celine'. It's too bad we never found out why he stopped looking."
" Wild, Wicked, Wacky and Witty!!
",-0.6103,0.9539,2019-09-14 00:00:00,7,"Mark Shakman; an excellent TV series episode director and producer-(Weeds, Fargo, G.O.T., Psych and others); has now joined the ranks of Tom Schumann, Martin McDonagh and Joel & Ethan Coen with this full feature film, Cut Bank! From Michael Stuhlbarg (Darby Milton) to John Malkovich (Sheriff Vogel) this cast is pure A listers that do not disappoint! Hilarious, gritty, suspenseful and witty with a completely original storyline. Best comparison would be: ""Fargo"" meets ""Seven Psychopaths"" meets ""Burn After Reading"" meets ""8 Heads In A Duffle Bag"" !????! This is probably Michael Stulbargs best role and performance with Men In Black 3. Hemsworth who leads this sensational cast is unremarkable sadly but the rest of the ensemble more than makes up for him and then some!! One of my favorite top ten films for sure!!"
" The Kitchen Sink Storyline Of Twisted Murder And Revenge - Good Fun
",-0.4404,0.9631,2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,"03/22/2019 The word ""CAMPY"" best defines this movie:- Being so extreme that it has an amusing and sometimes perversely sophisticated appeal. Over the top and farcical, intentionally exaggerated so as not to be taken seriously. Found primarily in television, theatre and motion pictures, camp endeavors for satire and, for those who fully understand and appreciate the risible nature of its material, it's not surprising when it develops a cult following.
Movie comment: Crazy, extreme, sometimes funny, nutzo, a good fun killer/survivor movie. Great cast. Bon Appetit"
" I JUST WANT MY PARCEL
",0.0772,-0.7725,2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"Dwayne (Liam Hemsworth) wants to leave the small town of Cut Bank, Montana. Like most small towns many people don't want to leave their comfort zone, something that plays into the background information. Dwayne works at an auto body shop for Big Stan (Billy Bob Thorton) and dates his daughter Cassandra (Teresa Palmer). Her goal in life is to be Miss Cut Bank.While Dwayne is out filming Cassandra in a field doing a community promo, he happens to catch on film the murder of the local postman (Bruce Dern). The local sheriff (John Malkovich) investigates the town's first murder. Dwayne tries to collect a reward offered by the post office for information of the murder of one of their employees. However he can't get paid until they find the body which is missing as well as the postal vehicle.Eleven minutes into the film we find out what is going on and just try to guess how many are involved. Derby Milton (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a taxidermist and a recluse most of the town thought was dead. He suddenly appears wanting his missing parcel and independently goes about solving the crime. Derby speaks with a stutter and is described as a ""Mongoloid."" He is strong for his size and appears to be a dimwit on the surface which is a misconception.As the bodies start to pile up, the film shifts into a fair dark comedy. One theme of the production is that small towns are prisons where people volunteer to stay, but once they leave, they don't come back. The film has quirk value (what Malkovich doesn't) but it is light compared to what we have been exposed.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Yes, and I also hate small town mentality too!
",-0.3164,-0.3883,2018-05-05 00:00:00,5,"A fairly dull yet watchable film noir black comedy.A young man video- taping his girl friend ""accidentally"" witnesses a murder which he happens to catch on camera.Whoever made this movie not only hates small towns but despises everyone who lives in such places.There are all sorts of wacky odd ball characters in this picture and despite it being ludicrous it has a certain low brow Fargo charm about it.4 and a half rounded up=5/10."
" This script was on the Blacklist? Huh?
",0.0,-0.8097,2018-01-01 00:00:00,6,"For those who don't know, the Blacklist is a list of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood.I saw where it had potential, although was telegraphing that it wasn't so good at the beginning. My guess is that the director, Matt Shakman (TV director, heavily with It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) got in over his head or had less and less resources, as it apparently was made over two years.My first impression of the set-up was asking why the shooter didn't notice Hemmesworth and his girlfriend so close. Thus, that brought me out of the movie. It made up for it somewhat as I then guessed the whole scam when Hemmesworth was reading the very obvious and large sign in the Post Office about murdering postal employees. In a town that never has murders.But then made me think that it was engineered as stupid as most of things like that require a conviction of the perpetrator. Thus, a very forced plot device.But okay, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Besides, it had a very good cast (except for the pedestrian Hemmesworth and Teresa Palmer). But did have some poor production values. And in the end it just felt sloppy. Malcovich had somewhat amusing character traits but then the epilogue of him not escaping the town years before was vague.Maybe there was something interesting there with the psyco played by Michael Stuhlbarg, but apparently they never shot it or cut it out. I could see if he was so proficient in killing and fighting on a regular basis, but it seemed like this was new for him and he was magically very good. But Stuhlberg still made something interesting out of what he had. Thus, quite a bit was missed. Maybe there's a much better 2 hour version somewhere vs. the 1 1/2 hours I saw.In the end, it was a few dumbasses with a dumbass (badly researched) plan that got way out of hand."

There's nothing wrong with paying homage if it's done well. The problem is that I don't think Dwayne's scheme would actually work in the real world. There are some good actors here.

" Yet another ""Fargo"" wannabe ....
",0.0,0.9094,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Somehow studios seem to be under the mistaken impression that by mentioning a comparison to ""Fargo"", their movie is going to magically be embraced by the theater going public. Any comparison of ""Cut Bank"" to ""Fargo"" is plain and simple false advertising. The film lacks Fargo's black humor, character development, and most importantly a clever script. The film does get the most from the talent of fine actors like John Malkovich, Bruce Dern, and Billy Bob Thornton , on this contrived drivel. None of the characters are developed, and none are even remotely likable. This is not Fargo-like, but is acceptable entertainment. - MERK"
