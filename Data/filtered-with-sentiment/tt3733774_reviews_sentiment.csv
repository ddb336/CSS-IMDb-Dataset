" Instead of a movie they decided to have an awkardness competition
",0.0,-0.5719,2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood try to scare each other with awkwardness throughout a badly written movie.Ethan Suplee tops everyone with patented ultra passive-aggressiveness.None of it makes sense as a story, and none of it is funny... You need to believe at least one character in a movie..."
" Some Heisty Fun with a Dynamic Duo in a Flawed Story
",0.7096,0.997,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I very much expected it to be a rather typical action drivel, but Brewer brothers actually have taken a more restrained approach, avoiding being over-the-top, trying to make a grounded crime drama, heist flick / cop flick, but not without some pulp. Even some little comedy. And, best of all, this adventure is led by the unprecedented dynamic duo of Cage and Wood.Stone (Nicolas Cage) and Waters (Elijah Wood) are two cops with a hunch about a shady drug operation, they decide to go rogue and investigate, and find a bank vault with unknown intriguing contents... Thus a cop/heist flick was born. Who knew that Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood have such a terrific dynamic between them - both are very well cast. The character of Stone might as well been written with Cage in mind, man's always good with eccentric or oddball characters. It is the most satisfying part of ""The Trust"" - performances and their quirky characters interactions. Having said that, the character development is lacking, fault of the script. The story's not without flaws, blanks are left in what motivation propelled specific characters, who and what they were stealing from, etc., the ending's kind of nicely grim for my taste, but a general lackluster at the same time.Even though part paint-by-the-numbers, part lets-just-have-fun, ""The Trust"" together makes an easily enjoyable heist flick, though largely reaching for drama rather than white-knuckle-thriller. Pacing's reasonably consistent from the very start, dialogue is always decent, plot's a little slow but not boring, and acting endures, there's enough to be engaged with. When we've gotten to the heist itself, it gets the most interesting, steadily going step by step, problems on the way, heavier drama and emotion setting in. Also, with the 9 mil budget, ""The Trust"" didn't have a lot of trouble to appear technically confident throughout.Among some music videos, ""The Trust"" is the only feature film Alex and Benjamin Brewer have directed, and it is a cool one, one that features two great performances and some tried and proven heisty fun. Check it out for these ingredients. My rating: 6/10."
" Funny, quirky, twisty, heist treat
",0.6808,0.971,2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Nice little movie.....nicholas cage was brilliant but a little surprisingly, so was Elijah Wood. Good chemistry between them, clever,entertaining script, good support cast and an ending i thought was really good because it wasn't a crowd pleaser and made it a much better film......"
" Ummm What!?
",0.0,-0.9761,2021-01-29 00:00:00,4,I couldn't agree more that this movies ending is so pathetic. You know Ithe fact is Elijah Wood is the one that made it suck because okay his partner just shot the guy and then said he came after him okay what's started the suspicion but to trust a probably a heroin addict girl with a three year old and like one said why don't you just pack everything up and and as you're about to drive away you know you just slip her a knife and let her call whoever she's going to call if you're going to do that and why they even went into the bathroom in the first place without their masks there's just so many holes in this movie oh my God and then he grew a conscience I guess but why is the woods ending to this movie was so poor all these close-ups of his eyes you know full of tears and and red eye and then we were supposed to just put it all together all you know we just shot the guy and then you feel sorry for this girl and then he feels guilty me feel scared and you know it was like there was no real acting there was nothing it was like almost like a third partner to get on have some banter about his emotions and it would it started out as a fun kind of a fun movie a funny movie and then it got really serious like The Walking Dead like the other review all about paranoia and you know let's kill each other it just was so many freaking holes in the the ending it really just pissed me off that's why it gets 4 out of 10 Stars only because you know they did pull off the first half but this movie is not worth your time it's only going to piss you off and 6 rotten apples spoiled the movie lol

",0.0,0.861,2020-08-18 00:00:00,4,"Conflicted on this one. Nicholas Cage doing what he does best and I really enjoyed the movie from his standpoint. But, wow Elijah Wood just ruined it. I know, I know he was playing a character. But I really must ask was he? Was he really acting at all in this? With someone else alongside Nicholas for this one and it would have been a decent crime flick. As it is it's worth watching if you can for free."

",0.0,0.9554,2020-05-18 00:00:00,6,"I was not expecting the greatest movie but I had hoped it would be more entertained than I was during this film. It was decent at best, I liked the way in which a couple of seemingly 'good' police officer come to commit this heist, I was not impressed with the overall film and the acting that took place. I thought that Cages character was not delved into enough. The start of the film makes him seem straight laced but as the film continues that does not seem to be the case. The scene when Ethan Suplee and Elijah Woods enter the cupcake store is also unexplained and seems out of place."
" Calm down
",0.3182,0.9871,2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"It's a movie. Just enjoy. People think or know how they'd react in this situation, but they don't. They never actually say what they are boosting. Good performances all around!!!! And yes Woods character flashes his badge to the security guard and has a cigarette and a convo, so yes we all know realistically he would have gotten caught!!! Is the script a little shaky? Yes, but it's a lower budget film and I'm willing to let it slide cause Nic Cage is excellent and Elijah Wood is a good compliment in this role!"
" Cage and Elijah
",0.0,-0.8779,2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"The dynamic between Cage and Elijah is a refreshing one. I enjoyed these two exchanging dialogue carrying a comedic value to the film. The film is somewhat similar to Bad Lieutenant: Port Call of New Orleans, being that they're both crooked cop crime dramas with humor. This is by no means as great a film as Bad Lieutenant, or in general, but it was very enjoyable. It moves very quickly and has you wondering what troubles next to come. The film's ending was lackluster, but I suppose not very predictable (as most Cage movie's aren't). If you love Nicolas Cage, I have no reason why you wouldn't love this film."
" Well, there's time I won't get back!
",0.3382,0.4924,2020-03-31 00:00:00,2,"Simply...hated it! From the beginning, it seemed like you're coming in in the middle of the story. Very haphazard. There was no character back story which made it very difficult to relate to them. I usually like Nicholas Cage and his penchant for ""outside the box"" and quirky characters. Not so in this case. The acting seemed stilted and forced. Did not appear to have character connections with each other. Had high hopes, got hopes dashed!"
" Wasted Effort
",-0.4939,-0.9429,2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,"I, along with over 12 + million others in our various movie forums, rate The Asylum movies as the worst on the planet. There is not enough space in the universe nor the galaxy to write down enough negative numbers for Asylum movies but this movie is far worse all due to Cage.Cage should be banned from making movies for life & all existing works of his need to be destroyed immediately world-wide.Don't waste your time on this stupid movie with poor script, direction & producers.
Acting was extremely poor & plot holes amassed from the second it started. Nothing made sense in the movie thanks to the script & Cage.You would get much more enjoyment out of watching paint dry or being awake for your own lobotomy :)"
" Another Cage miss go figure
",-0.1531,-0.743,2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,Another Cage miss go figure. A heist movie in Vegas with no budget. How could it be bad right?
" yes its all about Trust ( C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
",0.7184,0.2808,2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent movie. From beginning to end. Yeah, there were a few odd bits of dialog, but you can't find better acting than these two did. Nick my boy is masterful and the planning of the heist, and Elijah my boy boys paranoia and tense blind following was very suspenseful throughout and the moment of realization, the climax of this cinema gold is what made me love it. The very end will have your heart racing! 10/10 an instant favorite."
" Another Weird, Unpredictable Film By Nicholas Cage
",-0.1779,-0.3495,2019-12-15 00:00:00,8,"One of the reasons I enjoy Cage films is that they are not formulaic, prepackaged and predictable. You often not quite sure until it is over what genre the film is.This has a sort of 70's heist feel with a lot of chemistry between Cage and his unlikely pairing with Elijah Wood. At first both of them seem like fairly pedestrian cops until of course as usual you begin to discover one of them is clearly a psycho.The whole thing runs off the rails, finishes bizarrely and yet as usual with Cage films, I found it enjoyable as hell right to the end. I don't think I have ever seen a Nicholas Cage film that was bad or I didn't think worth watching. This one is a must-see if you can make it through all the strange segueways and character pieces."
" Awful ending.
",-0.4588,-0.8972,2019-12-09 00:00:00,2,"This film was alright, until the end. I don't really like Elijah Wood, and this character just adds to that. This film's ending was awful. Yes, let's believe that after being an accessory to murder and breaking into a mafia/gang vault, and also revealing yourself to a fellow cop, you'll kill your partner/cop and escape to where? What? Who thought this ending made ANY sense..?"
" A Diamond in the Rough for Cage
",0.34,0.977,2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"A tightly produced, acted and written film ""The Trust"" is easily one of the best Cage films in the last 15 years. Wood and Cage make for a memorable on-screen duo with an awesome infusion of black comedy and dramatic confrontation.We get small but insightful peak into each of their lives, as we see Wood's character lives a rather seedy life while Cage's character lives at home with his father (played by Jerry Lewis!) and seems to take his job seriously.The film builds wonderfully, loading the comedy up front in bits very smoothly, and then gradually turns up the heat when we realize the intent of Jim Stone. Then we are hit with a realistic (and brave) ending from the directors that doesn't really bring us to where we want to go, and I think is where most people have a problem with this film.Definitely has it's moments with great music and the setting of Vegas as the cherries on top. Don't forget to try some Lemmon slice with tobasco sauce and fool a friend! 8/10"
" Wasn't that bad
",0.431,-0.7164,2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"I really don't know why the rating is so low (5.4 at the moment). This movie has enough ingrediënts to carry you to the end. Not a masterpiece, but good enough to enjoy. I've seen far worse movies with higher ratings. This one deserves a 6.5 overall rating."
" What on earth?

" Tall and the short of it.
",0.0,-0.7297,2019-08-13 00:00:00,7,"Yeah it's a pretty good, maybe flawless, production of a ""simple"" heist type movie - certainly worth watching if you need to kill some time, but don't want to feel like you were cheated. At roughly an hour and a half long, one of two things are certain: either everyone gets away after an odd twist reveals it was never about what it was about, or it all goes to hell and everyone dies. I guess you'll have to watch it to find out which course it takes."
" Ho hum movie, tries hard to be different but ends up being nonsensical
",-0.0516,-0.8873,2019-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Crime drama based on greed follows a familiar pattern be it in a movie or a real life situation, no one ever risked their life just because they were bored but are patiently waiting for their retirement checks and social securit, maybe Woods character being young might contemplate a reckless adventure but not Cage, a over the hill middle aged cop. Also Woods was in it neck deep but a sudden change of heart because the loot belonged to some really badd guys? Both of them knew the set up, the safe, the casino connections it's really a stretch that drilling for hours Woods was ignorant about wtf was going on. Huge plot holes and a dismissive role for Jerry Lewis, weird casting choice, all in all a very weird, absurd story. I will give it a -10 even though only 1 star is possible."
" Robbing your time.
",0.0,-0.3582,2019-05-21 00:00:00,2,"Cage plays his character in his usual 'Wacky' way, and woods gives a usual stiff, but well acted, part to this crime Caper. I watched the first half of this movie, thinking what a great film. It's funny, exciting and shows the apathy, and disillusionment of many underpaid cops. It's the second half of this film that disappoints. It's like another director was drafted in to complete the movie, or the production costs spiralled out of control, so they needed a quick ending. I was yelling at my TV, saying 'WTF', and 'Why couldn't they have a better ending'. So, from this review, you can see, I was very unhappy with this film, so 2/10."
" Not what I expected but still awesome!
",0.7871,0.9974,2019-05-06 00:00:00,9,"It is amazing how much preconceived notions of what a movie is going to be can effect your reaction to it. I feel like this is where The Trust gets its bad ratings/reviews from. I'm not sure why but I went into it thinking it was a comedy. It does have some hilarious parts in it, but it's not primarily a comedy. I guess it's more like a dark comedy/thriller/drama. Anyway the point is I liked it the first time I watched it, but I LOVED it the second time. I don't usually feel this way, but I think when I knew what to expect I was able to enjoy it more. So don't let you initial reaction of it being different stop you from appreciating it.
The other reason people might not like this movie is the tired, old ""I hate Nicolas Cage"" attitude. If you don't like him, you just don't get him. He is an amazing actor who isn't afraid to push limits, think outside the box, or put everything into a role. If you really don't like him, stop watching his movies!
I love both Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood so that's what initially drew me to this movie. They make an awesome duo and play off each other really well. They also play the opposite parts to what I expected of them so it made for an unpredictable watch which I really liked.
I thought The Trust was a great movie. It was refreshingly different to a lot of movies. I just want people to give it a chance. It certainly doesn't deserve all the terrible reviews and ratings it has received."
" Awful and unrealistic ending!
",-0.5093,-0.5709,2019-05-05 00:00:00,2,Very stupid ending. As if you spend all that time planning and then return everything.
" A Goofy Heist Movie that Veers Toward Darkness
",-0.25,0.9959,2019-05-03 00:00:00,6,"I don't know why the idea of Nicholas Cage and Elijah Wood starring in a crime thriller together is funny to me, but it is. & for its first half, THE TRUST is funny. But what starts out as a silly neo-noir veers suddenly toward a darker realm as Cage's goofy Las Vegas police officer (echoes of his BAD LIEUTENANT role, but only echoes) reveals his cold-blooded determination to get at the contents of a secret vault at all costs, causing a rift to occur between him & Wood's softer character.THE TRUST is a heist movie, & it's when the heist begins that the movie really starts to shine. It takes the heist in creative, unexpected & funny directions, & during these parts is an enjoyable & engrossing film. The film wraps up way too suddenly, & overall is quite forgettable, but for a good chunk in the middle it had a certain spark while these two ridiculous men dug themselves deeper into the hole they never wholly grasped they were getting themselves into in the first place. Cage is fun to watch, & though more restrained than usual, his wild energy crackles from him like static off a bedsheet. The dialogue & handling of situations is nicely offbeat, & the script remains ontrack the whole way.THE TRUST is worth a watch if you like neo-noirs, heist movies, or Nick Cage doing his goofy thing. Or, like me, all of the above."
" I wanted it to end two minutes in
",0.0,-0.4404,2019-04-27 00:00:00,1,The title explains it all. A train wreck that has to be watched.
" A good watch
",0.4404,-0.9872,2019-04-27 00:00:00,6,"You don't get emotionally invested in the characters, but all are well played and entertaining. Loopholes in some of the story, don't be too critical. There are some complaints about the following spoilers in other reviews:1. They spend too much time at the crime scene. Well... yes, they do.
2. Elijah Wood let the female hostage call someone for a lame reason. Well, this isn't a loophole in the story, it's just something stupid a lot of people would do, obviously his character wasn't the brightest bulb.
3. Elijah;s character was willing to shoot his partner for lame reasons such as doubting his plan and disagreeing with whether they should continue to steal the stuff. Well, no... he was willing to shoot his partner because he couldn't bring himself to be part of killing the poor little lady they tied up in the bathroom. Another weakness (or strength) many people would have.Good movie without having to get all tied up in knots about it, have fun."
" Condensed 'Breaking Bad' (Nicolas Cage style)
",-0.5423,0.9941,2019-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Every time Nicolas Cage releases a new film I take a deep breath, hoping he'll recapture his former glory. Most times I should know better as the majority of his recent output seem to be 'straight-to-DVD' affairs made only for him to pay off whichever divorcee he's battling in the courts. However, 'The Trust' is actually pretty good. Certainly worth a watch.Cage 'buddies' with Elijah Wood as a couple of - slightly corrupt - Las Vegas police officers who figure they can retire early by robbing one hell of a big safe. Okay, so they're VERY corrupt, but they're still our (anti) heroes.The film's a bit of a mish-mash and, like I said, it's worth a watch for the most part. The first half is more of a 'buddy cop' affair and the banter between our two leads is highly watchable indeed. In fact, it's probably the film's highlight. Now, you may have noticed that I mentioned the awesome 'Breaking Bad' in the title - a long-running TV show about a mild-mannered Chemistry teacher who slowly descends into darkness by dabbling in the drug trade. The reason I saw similarities with 'The Trust' was that this film also as an older lead and a younger lead, slowly starting to leave the fringes of 'decency' and delving deeper into criminal activities. The major difference is that in 'Breaking Bad' the older man was the sensible one, whereas his younger business partner is a total unpredictable flake. In 'The Trust' it's the other way round. Many of the best gags are perforated by Elijah Wood's expression of total disbelief at Cage's bizarre antics.So, it's good. The characters are funny and the dialogue is sharp. And yet it's nowhere near a classic (which is a shame, as it really could have been a proper 'cult classic'). Whereas 'Breaking Bad' had the luxury of having five seasons of TV shows to show the gradual change in its characters, 'The Trust' tries to achieve this in an hour and a half. About halfway through the film one incident happens which kind of major changes not only one character, but also the tone of the film. From being quite a light-hearted little tale, it suddenly becomes much darker.That's my major gripe, plus I can see some people objecting to the ending, but I'm not about to give away any spoilers for that one. Overall, if you're a fan of Cage (or Elijah Wood, to be fair - he makes a great 'straight man' to Cage's craziness!) you should enjoy this. It's a bit all over the place, but the banter is fun and there may be a few moments that you definitely won't see coming. Good effort Nic - more of these please."
" Great movie. Getting a lot of undeserved hate.
",0.1027,0.9911,2019-04-10 00:00:00,9,"First half of review contains no spoilers, second half does as sort of a reply to the hate this movie is getting!Wood and Cage work great together. Both play very believable characters with likable personalities. (Cage is freaking wacky and I love it) The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's not typical, but it's definitely one of the best heist movies I've seen. It keeps things believable, and is also as unpredictable as real life can be. Definitely an exciting film with a very good ending. As someone else pointed out in a review, it's not ""by the numbers"" which was a great way to put it. But I, personally, am sick of predictable feel good endings like that.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!Some are saying the movie was great but the ending just completely ruined it! Then proceed to give it a 1 star review. I think this is insane. A movie is a piece of art. Who is to say it must have a feel good happy ending?
if i put myself in the shoes of Woods's character, I would have made a lot of the same decisions. From what we know, Cage's character has murdered two people. He is clearly a sociopath, so why wouldn't woods be wary of the idea that he might be using him? Also, he knows that someone with this much money definitely does have the sources to launch an investigation and find them eventually, but Cage forced him to go along with it, not leaving him with a choice. And lastly, he stated that he doesn't know what's going on or where he is. He was overwhelmed by everything that was happening and ultimately decided to try to do the right thing."

" A Decent Movie - Butt Nothing Exciting - Just A Payday For Chain Smoking Woody & Big Head Cage
",-0.3875,-0.2165,2019-02-23 00:00:00,6,"02/23/2019 Just an OK movie, well acted. That's about it. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Goodbye! The End"
" Two cops stumble on a heist opportunity of a life time - the ending doesn't translate well
",0.2467,0.9344,2019-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Two cops stumble on a heist opportunity of a life time. Equipped with loose morality the dynamic duo decide to follow the trail of leads to discover a hidden safe room. They hatch a plan, get the equipment required and commit to a daring heist. During the preparation and events Waters (Wood) becomes increasingly aware of Stones (Cage) unpredictability and erratic behavior.That is the premise and that's where it starts to go the wrong way, both in the movie and for the movie. While everyone on set does a pretty good job, the payoff escapes just in the final moments of the film. Overall it's a well made small budget movie but it just fails to deliver the promise of most of its run time, and leaves a more sour taste than a regular 'bad ending'-type movie would due to it's choices.Mostly because people think they are watching a different movie. One of the problems is that Cage's character is just too likeable, Yes, he acts quirky and is dangerous but for Waters (Wood) to do what he does in the end, he needed to be terrifying to feel justified from the characters perspective to viewers. The tone is wrong. What is being sold is a dark humor buddy cop movie but it would have worked better with a serious, 'Training Day' type, menacing tone.
The key element, that is in the name ""The Trust"", meaning both the funds in the safe they plan to rob and the trust between two conflicting characters doesn't get to play out as well as it should.For some reason this movie also decided to include a shot in the end to show that the woman survives the incident which I'm also really baffled about. Why? That scene could have ended with Waters fate, cut straight to epilogue. Why are we suddenly pretending she's a main character for that shot alone? Because of lack of strong female characters or something?The ending itself isn't complicated though some claim so. What they hit turned out be a massive Cartel operations diamond vault, the woman was in on it the whole time possible even a figure head of said Cartel (due to the dumb truck scene), just playing dumb for Waters. Waters, who was supposed to be the straight man of the story just freaked out and got a conscience spike from the thought of killing an ""innocent"" woman and blows everything up for himself and his partner and tries to get away from them by not stealing the diamonds and trying to hide somewhere. This is of course foiled by his earlier compassion towards the women as she used her phone call to notify backup. In the end, the great dream, the great opportunity ends up as their demise and the traces of it end up in the storage of their former workplace as just another tale, just another evidence. It's really that simple.Overall it's a competent movie, just not the kind you'd really want see again or put high on your to-watch list."
" Quirky Cop thriller
",0.1027,0.8841,2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,"From the moment the film started, I liked it, what a great music intro, it set the scene for the film perfectly. 1 very corrupt cop and 1 not so sure if he is that bad a cop set about on an adventure. Good Friday night film to watch."

",0.4003,0.8306,2018-10-31 00:00:00,8,"This movie starts out rather odd. Is it a comedy? Is it meant to be ironic? Or is it just simply a hard-boiled heist movie? This story has a rocky start, because it was wrong-footing me, what kind of movie genre it was and I guess this has put off many people who just dont like quirky in-between genre movies. In the end this quirky story,turns out to be a worthwhile addition to the heist genre though.But I had my trepidations at the beginning, because knowing Nicholas Cage's bad rep for starring in flops lately, at the start of this movie I was wondering if this was another one of those flops. It certainly aint. It takes some patience to understand what kind of movie this is, but once the story about cracking a vault gets going, it is a suspenseful, enjoyable, quirky story to watch. Add to that excellent acting by Elijah Wood and Nicholas Cage and what at first seemed to be a mishap, turned out to be quite an unexpected heist gem!"

The acting by Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood is great and the film does have a bit of humour, action and tension, but this film does lack things and could have been better. This film was good but I didn't like it that much because Nicolas Cage looked very ugly and awful with a big moustache and having a big moustache didn't look good on him.

" Bizarre, unenjoyable, confusing, and ultimately pointless.
",-0.4939,-0.9767,2018-07-12 00:00:00,2,"What a lousy movie!Very poor set-up, both in terms of who the characters were, as well as what they were doing. It was vaguely clear that they were up to no good, but it was pretty hazy.Eventually it became a sort of a heist movie, but the planning stages were again hazy. There was no clear series of tasks that needed to be completed; details worked out, problems overcome. The execution of the heist, such as it was, was messy. The fact that the two central characters didn't even seem to know what or who they were robbing didn't help to give me any sense of either rooting for them, or caring one way or another how things would proceed.Also, since one of them was killing people willy-nilly, it was unclear whether the audience is still expected to root for him and his partner to complete a successful heist, or for them both to get caught, or for the ""evil"" one to get killed or caught while the ""good"" one gets away with the loot... or something else entirely.When we eventually see what they are stealing, it is STILL unclear what it is exactly and who it belongs to. Plus additional items are found in a separate place that may or may not be connected to the first place - who knows? - and what the significance of these items are is never explained, nor is it clear whether these items are now part of the loot or not... and then it is suggested that maybe the ""evil"" heister knew all along about everything and was somehow conning his partner to be used as some sort of patsy... an idea which again goes nowhere... and then there's the hostage, who may or may not be in on it (or something else entirely) and seems to be connected to the mysterious vans that show up at the end (I'm trying really hard to avoid spoilers, so I'll have to leave it there)... and then the final shot of a lot of objects in a warehouse... what the hell???If this review seems weird, disorganised, rambling, incoherent, and ultimately pointless then it is, as intended, an accurate representation of the movie.What a mess!"

They play a pair of corrupt cops who decide to pull a heist on a vault said to contain a fortune in diamonds. This starts out as a very quirky comedy that gradually becomes darker and darker as it goes on. The story is familiar but the execution isn't: there's a good mix of funny bits, awkward moments, and a growing sense of unease and suspense as the story goes on. The film itself is quite low budget with only average direction, but Cage's oddball character lights up the screen. The real winner is Wood, once again delivering an oddly sympathetic and fragile performance, one of many in his interesting career."

",0.1877,0.2697,2018-02-18 00:00:00,3,"I think that with having watched this movie, I have fully realized that Nicholas Cage's choosing of projects in recent years has been almost completely poor. While this particular project is not the worst he has done, it is all the same a very unsatisfying viewing experience. There's not really anything wrong with the movie's basic premise - two cops deciding to pull off a heist- even though it's not an original one. There are a few good touches here and there, ranging from some nice music to acceptable production values for a direct to DVD project. The script, however, could have used some more work. The two central cop characters aren't fleshed out enough at the beginning, so we don't know what to think of them when they decide to pull off the heist. Also, it is really unclear whether the filmmakers want us to sympathize with these characters or not. A bigger problem is that the heist portion of the movie - the main selling point - isn't particularly exciting or tense. Instead, there is an almost casual feeling, despite the fact that there are unplanned factors that happen to the two cops during the process. Jerry Lewis fans should also know that he's is totally wasted here, appearing in just two small scenes. The movie never gets to be downright boring, I admit, but even then there really isn't much here that will grab even the most patient viewers."

Instead, you get an illogical half-baked ending that makes absolutely no sense (especially for two trained police officers).I don't know what the plan of the writer and director of the movie was other than to make you feel like you've been kicked in the junk at the end. If that was their intention, they definitely hit the mark.Please don't waste your time on this nonsense. If you want to experience 'The Trust' and save yourself over an hour of your life, just jam your crotch against your sofa armrest.

",0.0,0.7172,2017-07-12 00:00:00,2,"There are certain actors and actresses whom I will watch in anything they release, Nicholas Cage is one of those actors. Even in the worst movies, he always gives a strong performance and I enjoy watching him work, but even the Academy Award winning actor couldn't save The Trust. Cage plays Stone, a lifelong cop still on the bottom of the pecking order. Luckily for him, he's paired with the much younger Waters (Elijah Wood), another cop with few aspirations. Together they don't make up a team of elite crime fighters, so on their off hours, they're small time criminals, and as it turns out they're not great at that either. One day while investigating a case, they notice a safe in the evidence room and decide to bust it open, what's inside leads them into a mess of police corruption. For starters, this movie doesn't make sense! Everyone talks in riddles, it's impossible to know who is on what side, and most important of all, what's the point? If these guys are corrupt cops, why do they care so much when they discover that they aren't the only ones? They're losers who don't care about anything, until they find out there are other bad cops, then all of a sudden they are Starsky and Hutch? I love the cast, but between the riddles, the constant twists, and the strange dialogue this film was just a mess, and pretty much unwatchable."
" Average at best
",0.6369,0.9355,2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"Average at best. The final act had some twists and turns, making it the best bit of the film, but still, the rest of it is not that strong. It isn't that weak though. ""The Trust"" relies significantly on the dynamic of the main duo - Cage and Wood - and for the most part they do a good job. Cage portrays his typical character - an apparent ordinary man that increasingly becomes darker and dubious. Wood is the one that keeps both of their feet in the ground, in a more contained role, still pulling it off rather good. This is a film you'll only watch because of this two, specially because, apart from this two, there's no much to see and that is, probably, the major flaw of ""The Trust"". There are no side-characters - apart from Stone's (Cage) father, played by Jerry Lewis, that has only around 1 minute of screen time. ""The Trust"" had some potential. There's no need to say that most of it was lost."
" A Wood Cage Production
",0.0,-0.9625,2017-03-28 00:00:00,4,"This movie starts out really strong. The plot maybe a bit nonsensical but it's fast-paced and keeps your attention. Through about the first hour, we're doing alright. But that last half hour, sheesh! The movie falls flat, riddled with plot holes and ludicrous character decisions, mostly by Elijah Wood. Then to top it all off, the final scene raises the ridiculousness to an entire new level.I know that this is just a dumb heist movie but the script should at least try to maintain a semblance of being believable. Is that too much to ask? The movie's title is ""The Trust"", wanting us to focus on the relationships in this movie and the trust established with them. If that's your whole movie idea, why not focus on that more. We know next to nothing about Cage & Wood's relationship. How long have they known each other? Are they close? The movie doesn't tell us. It's suppose to be this traumatic scene when Wood betrays Cage but we as the audience have no emotional ties to their relationship. Neither of them is exactly likable so the rift that is formed between them (which is out of nowhere, by the way) doesn't mean anything to us. And why exactly Wood decides to trust the girl over Cage at the end is beyond me. Poor ending, very poor."

The two play down on their luck police officers, that decide to rob a drug dealer together; by breaking into his secret safe, that they just recently learned about. It was directed by Alex and Benjamin Brewer, and it was scripted by Benjamin and Adam Hirsch. The movie features Sky Ferreira, Ethan Suplee, Steven Williams and the legendary Jerry Lewis in supporting roles. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it got a limited indie theatrical run at the Box Office (as well as a VOD release). I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to!Sergeant David Waters (Wood) and Lieutenant Jim Stone (Cage) are friends, that both work for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department together (in the Evidence Management unit). They're both struggling financially, and they're also both tired of their jobs. So when Jim learns that a local drug dealer keeps all of his valuable merchandise in one building, the two decide to rob it together. Stone is completely committed to the idea, and quite obsessive about it, while Waters is reluctant to go along with the plan. David quickly regrets his decision, when things become much more complicated than they expected.The movie is a surprisingly well made crime drama; it's often intense, and involving, and the characters are pretty well developed. Wood and Cage are also both perfectly cast in their roles; and you get to see another great manic performance from Cage, but this time in a good film (which doesn't happen frequently enough lately). I also really like the style and music of the movie. It's just an all around entertaining heist flick. It's a little dark, and depressing, but it's also a lot of fun.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY"
" Two for the safe
",0.4404,-0.8486,2017-02-03 00:00:00,3,How the mighty have fallen heading for not very good direct to TV films. Nicolas Cage is Jim Stone and Elijah Wood is David Waters who both work in the evidence room of Las Vegas police department. Both are bored with Waters passive and Stone quirky.When Stone discovers a drug dealer has met his high bail receipt connected to a recent drug bust he reels in Waters to do some snooping around and end up with a plan to rob a vault.What starts as a crime caper involving crooked cops takes a dark turn as Stone turns sinister especially as they take a female hostage and Waters realise his partner in crime has gone a little bit cuckoo.The film has dark comic elements like an early Coen Brothers noir movie. It has an oddball performance from Cage and a more restraint one from Jerry Lewis who makes a brief appearance. The movie is lukewarm but at least is offbeat enough.
" Unusual, but too chaotic to be entertaining
",-0.1154,-0.4459,2017-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Nicholas cage is without out a doubt won of the most successful actors of his generation. Love him or hate him, you cannot deny he is talented at what he does. Ever since Wild at Heart he has made playing weird characters his niche.In ""The Trust"" he goes a step further. Many of his characters over the years have been a little too similar, but this time he goes all out to be different. And he does it very well with this performance. A very weird and unsettling man, who is far from likable, but remains interesting and unpredictable throughout.That said, the story line suffers from being too predictable at times and too unbelievable at others. A rather unsatisfying chaotic experience that leaves the view wondering what else they could have been doing for the last couple of hours.It rates poorly with me simply because it left me cold. Too much violence and madness, with little cleverness in the plot line to balance it out."

",0.4404,0.9426,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"The Trust (2016) keeps away from entertainment for the first act, opening as something lighter and more approachable, exploring the drudgery of Waters and Stone's day job. The men catalog evidence, stepping around lively crime scenes to collect important pieces of the law and order puzzle, but the routine is getting to them. The chemistry between Cage and Wood is solid and reminds of earlier crime partner films.It's psychologically cloudy stuff, but the Brewers establish motivation without losing pace, while Cage and Wood portray working stiffs to satisfaction, making their characters needy but not completely irrational. There becomes a point during the film when it feels as if it just stops and becomes monotone. The films stalls and it doesn't reach the proper heights as it should have.The film falls off heavily within the last 30 minutes or so. As it becomes nontraditional and not good enough. Some parts of the ending felt rushed, as the climax was very little. All in general, this is just another forgettable Nicolas Cage film that isn't enough to warrant much of a viewer- unless you're a true. And it isn't enough for a comeback either.
=============================================================
As a rewatch (03/24/18') the Trust remains a forgotten small drama thriller with nothing much of suspense or thrills.. Overall, the film is watchable but after another viewing it doesn't get too much better."
