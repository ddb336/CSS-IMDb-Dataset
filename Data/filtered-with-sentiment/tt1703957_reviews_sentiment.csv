" Genius and mortal are on the line
",0.0,0.9451,2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Jude Law is almost one of my favorite British actors. In this film, his performance is a little decadent, which matches the image of a wandering writer. The exhibition of the publishing house's social environment reveals some of the splendor of the last century. The inspiration comes and goes quietly. Finally, only two ancient souls look at each other humorously or smile at each other in the world."
" Jude and Colin's bromance brought me to this movie
",0.0,0.9976,2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"I went into watching this movie knowing very little about Thomas Wolfe and Maxwell Perkins, but wanting to watch the movie primarily for some of my favorite actors Jude Law and Colin Firth. I thought they would be a very interesting combination on screen and they did not disappoint! I watched a few of their interviews about the movie and found the backstory to creating the it very interesting, especially the fact that it was the first movie of a celebrated theater director, Michael Grandage. After seeing the film, what stood out to me was the amazing acting performances. Jude Law had mentioned in his interviews that Thomas Wolfe was a larger than life character and he had worked very hard to balance his performance to the calm reservation of Colin's Maxwell and I thought he did that perfectly. I loved how Maxwell would be the voice of common sense for Thomas. Their friendship is what I connected to most in the story and I became so involved that I did cry at the end when Max was reading Tom's letter.I also loved Laura Linney portraying the steadfast quiet strength for her husband Max when he needed it, even if she was upset with him. Nicole Kidman is always amazing in her movies, but her character's obsession over Thomas was so dramatic through out the movie and then she was able to just dismiss him at their last meeting. That didn't quite make sense to me.I also enjoyed the cinematography and the sepia color of the movie. It definitely is a niche movie, but I appreciate this movie and wish it had more success. I actually want to watch it again to savor it and I think I may go read Thomas Wolfe's books now."
" Uneven but with promising premise
",0.5499,0.993,2020-07-21 00:00:00,6,"Although one of the strengths of 'Genius' is the work from a high-quality cast, the film as a whole sadly fails to communicate any meaningful human emotion and the result is flat, wooden and uneven. In spite of the attempts from cast members, the film is not moving or hard-thinking. Overall it lacks the gravitas it should have. Part of the problem is the conventional, predictable and cliché-heavy screenplay, despite some occasionally profound and sometimes funny pieces of dialogue. But not all is dull in this film. It does have some very enjoyable aspects. For example, the film faithfully recreates the New York of the late 1920s and early 1930s with vigour and noteworthy skill, and it features some beautiful cinematography and a nice use of colour along the way. Most pieces of dialogue are well developed. Some passages from Thomas Wolfe's rich prose are quoted or read by Colin Firth to very good effect. Likewise, the use of music remains mostly successful throughout the film. However, 'Genius' proves that these virtues and an intriguing creative premise with notable intentions are sometimes not quite enough to make a film reach the heights it could have otherwise reached. 'Genius' may not be a work of genius but it is, no doubt, entertaining and interestingGrade: 6.1 / 10"
" A good insight into the world of publishing
",0.4404,0.5093,2020-01-15 00:00:00,8,I never knew how much effort writers and editors put into the books they publish until I saw this movie. I didn't even know what editors do exactly. Such an exacting job. (And I'm heartily glad I can now read and write given that I was homeschooled and barely read or wrote anything myself at all!)
" Biography...beautiful prose of a relationship.
",0.0,0.997,2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,"When it first this movie came out in 2016 and for some reason, I did not have an opportunity to see it.
I didn't know what was the story about. It got to my attention the great actors in it but never read the storyline of the film. Although, I was interested to see it throughout all this time. Finally, I decided to see it today. I was not disappointed at all.
This is a biography of friendship between a Writer (Wolfe) and his editor (Maxwell Perkins).
Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors. His role as the editor emulated the father figure that any young individual will need in a lifetime. He Knew in his heart that Wolfe was different, then with his guidance he will take off as a famous writer of his time. Love the fact, the film focused on the great friendship-mentor and father and son figure, rather then becoming a brilliant writer to be. Jude Law was really great pertaining to a role of a young writer dedicated to what he believed. His role follows his dream into getting published after failing so many times until, he found someone that will per see his bright mind as a writer.
Laura Linney, Nicole Kidman, they were great in their roles as their wives. Guy Pearce had a small cameo as the writer Scott Fitzgerald and Dominic West as Ernest Hemingway. If you like biography dramas Genius will not disappoint you. Give it a try! Loved it!"
" A slow dragged out film
",-0.0516,0.6876,2019-06-10 00:00:00,5,"It probably for people who have heard of maxwel prior to watching film the only person i heard of was fitzgerald. The films about a creative story writer who can't seem to write without being over descriptive.
when i looked up gatsby other names he first considered i got Fitzgerald was never satisfied with The Great Gatsby as the title. The early working title was ""Among the Ash Heaps and Millionaires""; other titles that he considered were ""Trimalchio in West Egg,"" ""Trimalchio,"" ""On the Road to West Egg,"" ""Gold-hatted Gatsby,"" and ""The High-bouncing Lover."" In this movie they say he was going to call in Trimalchio in West Egg.
Was this film right or not?"
" ""Oh, that's just Tom""
",0.0,0.9288,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"It is such a feat how it makes us look down on a literary genius. Most works conclude with art, but the way it faces the fires directly it feels like almost a privilege to watch. But as the rewards come early, its journey is 'after art': Legacy. ""Are we making it better or different?"" And peters at its natural conclusion of the finished work, it has nowhere to go, which reflects the magic of what they shared, and the dire aftermath as being the time in between magic. The pull back from the skyline mocks that this would end the film, and what follows is the longest denouement in film history, with an hour, one scene after another, where the audience 'learns'. This tedium works because it reflects the process, as when they're finished, the film is lost and scrambling same as the characters are; even as it sinks the movie and they rebel against the sinking of the ship within the aftermath.* He is ""an octopus"" as reverse engineers the book as the person and the person is the limbs hopelessly a slave to the creative dragon.* ""After Thomas there is a great hush"" interesting the effect of being warned brings us some kind of cinematic dread, same as his turn as Dickie Greenleaf. Here we don't want to lose him either, even though he's not really lovable just lively.* Kidman and Law also quotes Cold Mountain combating the repression of their love with liveliness.* The editor's wonderful family is neglected and he never really comes around; it's frank and brutal about the consequences of 'art' concluding with their efforts being a worthy and profound burden.* Fitzgerald teases screenwriting hackery which blasts the film's own on the nose hackery of its 'lessons learned' second half. But then at least there is great function there if the 'prose' is bad* Fitzgerald is shown crumbled by the creative dragon. ""Five of your words are worth one of his."" The foil shows Wolfe shies of facing said dragons through his song and dance, bringing the film's most counter intuitive insight--this as well is a phenomenon of the narcissist--that somehow his great art is not exposing him but hiding him. Then the journey conclusion is not success but him editing himself; its tragedy is he was already lost in the conquest, a piece of him gone. Constantly the film shows such productivity does not come often even for the writers themselves.* Lastly, most frightening of all, compare the wives of all three, and you see the various consequences of art as burned by the divine fires, in various histrionics and states of destruction, the women directly reflect their husbands consequence as literary mirrors. The husbands live there after all, then the wives naturally would show it. Do they have to compete with books so live in this way? Or is it more the reflection deity; art is cleansing, restoring, a divine endpoint, but catastrophically destructive for its conduits and everyone around them. Most modest with the editors wife who casually states she writes as well."
" Genius isn't necessarily a mighty movie. But it's a very good one.
",0.6474,0.8991,2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Grandage's debut, based on the novel Max Perkins: Editor of genius, is a very interesting film supported by the performances of a great cast."

" All-star cast
",0.0,0.9898,2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"With an incredible cast of Colin Firth, Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Guy Pearce, Laura Linney, and Dominic West, be prepared for some wonderful acting in Genius. It's a movie about the real-life editor Max Perkins who worked with famous authors, but while a few scenes touch on his relationships with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, the majority of the film is devoted to his work with Thomas Wolfe.While there is a lot to appreciate in this movie, namely Colin Firth's emotion and Jude Law's energy, I couldn't ignore the overall feel that John Logan's script didn't quite know what direction it wanted to take. Since the film is about a very wordy writer and the quest to cut down his manuscript before publication, perhaps Logan purposely wrote his script with that tone, so that the screenplay mirrored the plot's difficulty. If it was done on purpose, it was very clever and well done. If it wasn't, then the storyline coincidentally explores many different avenues without taking the time to fully finish or flesh out any of them.There's a particular scene that I remember most vividly: Colin and Jude and working to cut down his manuscript, and a passage is read aloud about the protagonist falling in love at first sight. He describes the woman's appearance, and it's so beautifully poetic, I was almost moved to tears. At the end of the scene, Jude agrees to cut the entire description, leaving only, ""Eugene saw a woman. Her eyes were blue. So quickly did he fall for her that no one in the room even heard the sound."" After hearing the original prose, I was so disappointed! The scene was supposed to illustrate the fantastic working relationship between the two, and to show what a great editor Colin is, but I would have rather seen Jude's works published in its entirety, split into many volumes. The loss of such beautiful words made me lose my appetite for the rest of the film.If you're a sucker for 1930s period pieces and love the cast, you'll probably be entertained by Genius. It's not a film I want to watch again, but I do like to appreciate good acting. Although, Jude Law's over-the-top accent made me think he was faking his identity and was somehow trying to scam Colin Firth. And Guy Pearce's depressive portrayal of F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't at all how the author's fans would like to remember him, but there's always Midnight in Paris for a more likable, upbeat interpretation."
" Next: Rambo's defense attorney
",0.128,0.4516,2017-12-02 00:00:00,4,"It's 1929 NYC. Editor Max Perkins (Colin Firth) reluctantly reads a manuscript from Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law). Max is bowled over. Thomas is overwhelmed by the acceptance after many rejections from other publishers. Max has 5 daughters with Louise (Laura Linney) and Thomas becomes a son he never had. The two work to publish many successful works. Thomas's wife Aline Bernstein (Nicole Kidman) grows jealous of the relationship. Eventually, the highly unstable Thomas leaves Aline and clashes with Max. Max's other writers include Ernest Hemingway (Dominic West) and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Guy Pearce) who struggles with his disturbed wife Zelda.This movie should be zeroing in on Thomas Wolfe rather than Max Perkins. That's where the drama exists. The first half struggles with a lot of Max reading, sitting, and smoking. A writer can be a static subject but a reader is infinitely more static. By following more with Max, the dissolution of Thomas' marriage doesn't get enough exposition and it comes apart off-screen. There is so much inherent drama that it does create some very compelling scenes. This should have been Thomas and Aline's collapsing marriage with a side of Max. It could have been so much better."
" Be original. Blaze new trails.
",0.3182,-0.3955,2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a biopic of the relationship of editor Maxwell Evarts Perkins (Colin Firth) and his newly discovered genius author Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law) who has self destructive tendencies that disrupts the lives of those he touches. We meet his girlfriend Aline Bernstein (Nicole Kidman) who has given up her family for his genius. F. Scott Fitzgerald (Guy Pearce) is in his waning years, caring for Zelda (Vanessa Kirby) the topic for a different biopic tragedy.The film was well acted as one might guess from all the A listers. The problem I had was, like my life, it pretty much goes no where. We can discuss various themes such as Wolfe's search for a father, but any real theme eluded me, and the film really needed something to define its purpose more openly.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity."
" Editors of genius.
",0.0,0.9984,2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"A beautiful biography story, but definitely not a popular movie, it is a niche to those literary lovers. Personally, I am not very deep into literature and history. Besides, I am not a native English speaker, therefore it's difficult to resonate with those passions from these english master great pieces. As a normal person that know nothing deep about literature, I like this movie, it has a great scrip.I liked the scriptline of Max, when he was during the argument of Tom, the words are so mature:
""God help anyone who loves you, Tom. Because for all your talk and all your millions of beautiful words, you haven't the slightest idea of what it means to be alive. To look into another person's eyes and ache for him. I hope someday you will. And then maybe all your words will be worth five of Scott's.""Although Thomas Wolfe was a master writer, yet he just an unresponsive loser in life. It would be a pain if anyone have such friend in real life. This friendship must be truly remarkable between Max and Tom, unfortunately, Tom didn't cherish because things are too easy to get for a genius.Anyway, success is not only for talented people, it also reward the one who is responsible and insists the hard work. Editor is an underrated role, writers always claim all the success in their name. But sometimes writer can have great ideas and cool plots, but they would lack of the ability to put down in words, and a good editor really save the soul of the story."
" What a Bore
",-0.25,-0.9745,2017-08-18 00:00:00,2,"What a waste of a talented cast. This movie is so boring, badly directed. It has nothing going for it. No drama, no suspense, nothing interesting to offer. The script is pseudo intellectual.The character is boring. Laura Linney only has 2 lines, Nicole Kidman has 10 lines, Guy Pearce has 2 lines, Jude Law lots of mumbo jumbo out of his mouth which nobody can relate to, and Colin Firth the main character doesn't seem to say much. I have no idea , why is this editor's life Max Perkin's life is turned into a book and a movie. I wasn't interested at all in his biography. Is it because of bad direction or screenplay that i don't find his life story interesting , i won't know for sure.Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews here. It's just plain boring! 2/10 for the acting, otherwise 0/10"
" A great little movie
",0.6249,0.9698,2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"An exceptional film, especially for a first movie by a director who has been a television actor and not too prolific. With several moments of intense emotion perfectly developed and interpreted by the three main actors —Firth, Law and Kidman— that are superb all of them. Precious staging, music, lighting, recreation of the ambient of the beginning of the century and all those words, always those beautiful words, at its right time and in its proper place. Probably, over time, it will become one of the best films of the past year. Also I think every writer should see it."
" Writing it
",0.0,0.9848,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"A bunch of great actors portraying a bunch of great writers (plus a publicist, though that would be an understatement for the role he played). As you can imagine the acting is superb, male and female talent have a lot to bite and chew off with their roles. The dialog is great and I was surprised this didn't do better or was promoted better (at least in Germany).Then again it's not an easy watch, what with lots of dialog and drama. But the tension it builds (especially concerning the relationships of the characters within) is really great. Flaws are here to be exposed and the actors cherish them, playing them perfectly. It's a period piece and therefor may interest some people more than others. But if you like good drama, you could do worse"

They did a great job with what could have otherwise been dull subject matter."
" How Not To Gild The Gold.
",0.0,-0.0077,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"It's difficult to make a movie about a writer. After all, the only thing they do is sit there and write. Look at the disaster that was ""Hemingway and Gelhorn,"" with Big Ernie played by Groucho Marx. Or ""Julia,"" with Jane Fonda throwing a typewriter through the window. There's the soap opera about F. Scott Fitzgerald, ""Beloved Infidel."" I mention ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" only in passing.This effort to capture Thomas Wolfe the way he captured metaphors is more successful than the others. And his writing isn't just alluded to; it's integrated meaningfully into the plot. I haven't read any of his novels. They do go on. Ars longa, vita brevis. But I did skim some shorter work of his many years ago and, without at all trying to, I had one of his more striking images burned into some long-term memory cell -- something about a setting sun over Brooklyn hanging in the sky ""like a hot copper penny."" It ain't bad.Neither are the performances, all of which clear the bar. Nicole Kidman is Tom Wolfe's married lover who has sustained him over the rough patches. He discards her when he no longer needs her, but who can blame him? A theater person, she is hysterical half the time and rude the other half. She gobbles pills in a fake suicide attempt and pulls a pistol on docile Max Perkins. It all began to remind me of my marriage. Guy Pearce has a small role as a distraught F. Scott Fitzgerald and is perhaps a bit robust for the part. Laura Linney is fine but doesn't have much to do as Perkins' wife.The film belongs to Colin Firth as Max Perkins, the editor as Scribner's publishing house, and to Jude Law as the passionate, loud, Byronic Thomas Wolfe, shouting ecstatically, waving his arms about, recklessly drunk. His prose is, as they say, sheer poetry. But he has a genuine problem with his writing. Everything he writes goes on too long. If a minor character makes an appearance, say, a railway porter, Wolfe gives us his whole life story. Perkins' job is to winnow the prose until it's golden. When discussing the fourth chapter of one of the novels with Wolfe, Perkins explains why the text is prolix and makes observations and criticisms that would benefit a high school lit class. It's clear without being challenging. Nicely done by screenwriter John Logan.Throughout the film, Perkins wears a fedora. He doesn't take it off when he's at the office or at home having dinner. There's no indication that he removes it when he goes to bed. He's a prim, stuffy, urban bourgeois who is introduced to rhapsodic displays in what would have been called Negro night clubs. I thought Perkins always wore that conspicuous hat because he was hiding a bald spot, but no. He wears it so that in the last scene, after Wolfe has passed away, he can reveal the depth of his affection for his lost friend by removing it for the first time. In this final scene there is a slow pan across the book shelf in Perkins' office. The modern classics are all there, cheek by jowl -- Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald and the rest -- and Wolfe's novels are among them. All except one, ""You Can't Go Home Again."" It was Wolfe's ultimate work but was patched together by a different editor.This is a rare, successful movie about a writer and about his editor. What could have been either extremely dull or extremely phony, isn't either. It's not a masterpiece but it's pretty good."
" Don't mention ""true story"" when it's a total distortion
",-0.3252,-0.7719,2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Grotesque! Did the writer take the trouble to read Wolfe? Did Jude Law only read Wolfe? Did Nicole Kidman read the correspondence between Thomas and Aline? It is to be believed that nobody wanted to check facts and people as they were. Wolfe was a shy giant, but the script depicts him as an unstoppable narcissist. The twentieth century gives two geniuses to American literature: William Faulkner and Thomas Clayton Wolfe. This movie is an insult made to the second. Do not go see it, rather take the time to read or reread Wolfe. Wants to know more about the Wolfe- Perkins relationship? Read ""To Loot My Life Clean: The Thomas Wolfe- Maxwell Perkins Correspondence"". Mr. Law, you may have interpreted the character of the script correctly, but your duty was first and foremost to find out who the real Thomas Wolfe was."

But for those who love literature it is interesting to look at such famous writers, that quite frankly I always saw as some sort of gods, not even giving them a real image, and now seeing them as human beings, failing and being petty as they write tremendously. It is interesting to think of the process of writing that created The Great Gatsby and what follows next. It make us realize that we are just commons humans no matter what great achievements we make. There are some moments in the movie that are going to get our attention and some suspense in the middle that is well explored. Jude Law, specially, and Colin Firth are actors that know what they are doing and that helps painting the picture. Overall an average movie that can become interesting if you enjoy watching an image of great writers from the pass, but not much more than that."
" Behind a great writer, there's a genius editor!
",0.6588,0.9966,2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"I felt the title 'Genius' was not appropriate for how the story revolved in the film. It was more like a commitment and priority given to those undertaking than any other stuffs and that's why it looked like a genius from others eyes. Though I won't deny the experience always comes very handy. This film tells the story of ant editor and how he meets one of the best writers of his time. But they two together give the literature world some masterpiece works and that's the tale the film very genuinely presented to us.This story takes place around the 1930s. An enthusiastic writer and a genius editor develop a strong bond, especially from their professional, but it goes beyond that. When both the families struggle while these two men completely dissolved with their works. So the takes from different angles about the different issues nicely revealed.This biographical film is nothing short for any inspiration if you are looking for some. If you are a book lover, then this is not to be missed, especially if you have read the books by Thomas Wolfe. It's unbelievable that the film was made by a first time director. The actors, including the Colin Firth and Jude Law in the major roles was exceptionally good. We have seen many great films about the authors, so for a difference this film focused on an editor. It stands on the line of Bryan Cranston's 'Trumbo'. I hope you won't miss it, because it is so good if you appreciate the real life achievers, even those standing behind someone's achievements.8/10"

I felt choked up as the last words of the movie were said and yet a smile of joy crossed my face. It's seeing the beauty and magic of words and reminds us of how lucky we are to have been blessed with masters of the written word. I spent some time after watching this great movie, learning about Mr. Wolfe...He was a man not much different than many men of the early 20th century. Bold, brave, learned, articulate and driven. There are many amazing authors from the 20th century, Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner,Fitzgerald, Salinger,DH Lawrence et al. - make it a point in your life to read as many as you may.

" Talent, Torment and Tragedy
",-0.3818,0.9913,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"The great Truman Capote once brilliantly said that ""when God hands you a gift, he also hands you a whip; and the whip is intended for self-flagellation."" I tend to think that the last part is the most definitive and most painful one, specially to a crafted artist whether being a writer, a filmmaker or anything related to the arts. The amount of trouble, pain and suffering that goes through the mind of a creative mind during the long process of making something meaningful, the roads taken to make that art relevant or at least palatable to someone is like moving mountains you're not completely sure they must be moved in the first place, or never knowing that they're heading to the right direction. I've never read Thomas Wolfe's works but what I could gather here in ""Genius"" seems like a true definition to Capote's words. Here's a talented yet tormented soul that knew how to expose his views with long descriptions about the world he knew, it seemed brilliant on paper but it dragged on endlessly each book came by...but that in the words of his editor who managed to make those works something that readers would like to read. It's more of question of Wolfe being born on the wrong era; in our times it's quite possible that he'd manage to publish his novels in the way he intended to be. Unfortunately, books are a true definitive so everything that is essential must stay on the page, and in the mind of a writer this is a constant and heavy torment to bear, specially when you're forced to leave something out or worst, when you think you left out something important. It's not like a big budget film where years later the author can make a director's cut version, changing and adding stuff to the audience to present how the original idea was better than the edited version the studio forced them to release. Intelligent readers and watchers of the world, this movie is for you despite its imperfections and it's lack of a higher engagement. ""Genius"" stars Colin Firth as Max Perkins, the famous editor who published best-sellers from the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. One day a huge manuscript came to his desk from a certain unknown Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law). Intrigued by the story and the evident talent by the young man, Perkins decides to publish the book on the condition of extensive rewrites to make it shorter. Wolfe is appalled but since Perkins' publishing company was the first to accept his novel after being rejected by several others, he complies and gets instructions in how to reduce what's repetitive and unworthy and make it more concise (Perkins was also a writer). The result was ""Look Homeward, Angel"" and the rest is a successful history that evolved into a deep friendship between both men. Since films cannot translate with exact measure the weight of a literary work, we only get glimpses of what Wolfe writers with a minimum of context - but they worked at least for what I saw and the intended message of conveying Wolfe's world. Then inspiration came again to Wolfe. Boxes and boxes of manuscripts totaling 5000 pages and in what would become ""Of Time end the River"", drastically reduced and with years of development to reach its known version. But by that time Wolfe and Perkins relationship (friends at first, then more paternalistic to Wolfe) started to deteriorate not only because of constant fights over why it was important the book stay in that long way but also due to personal problems Wolfe had with his rich girlfriend (Nicole Kidman); and also some minor problems Perkins had in spending some quality time with his family because of his work obsession with that epic book.In the end, ""Genius"" fascinates us without that extra twinkle in the eye one would expect from a real-life story. It doesn't inspire neither cause amazement; but it reveals a reality hardly seen or presented on films. John Logan's script isn't one of his greatest, it's quite moderate but perhaps there's something about the acting or the direction that forced the film in going to a path that wasn't so brilliant or appreciative. The characters are somewhat distant that it's hardly to engage for any of them or to deeply understand their true motivations: is Perkins right with his guidance to Wolfe or it's just a matter of sabotage because he'd become a writer more referenced than Perkins was? Perkins is right in cutting everything because the other is pretentious or because there's a lack of talent in there but he knows how to shape it? It's all a mystery.Firth is always a true class act even though he makes of Perkins someone really cold; Law is over-the-top but Wolfe might have been that kind of guy, who shouts and flows with such energy that is hard to deal with it, some would say his performance is erratic, to me it was on/off. Kidman didn't impress me, showing off a lot; and Laura Linney steals the show as Perkins wife. The problem with ""Genius"" is having a first-time director carrying this material. Sure, Michael Grandage is a known theater name but he's no Orson Welles or Sam Mendes to make a spectacular transition with such high-class cast and material. Wolfe made his mark, now he's part of the American canon of writers of the 20th Century. But the readers of the world were deprived of something that now is lost and gone forever thanks to Perkins. We'll never know who got it right in this battle for the arts. And I think it's fair to say that the talent Perkins had also came with a whip, one that was more hard-hitting on him whether editing his friend's book but also in ways that their friendship almost ended. 8/10"
" A bit too well edited, but great film
",0.802,0.9742,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"At first you think that the movie's title comes from the bombastically exuberant Thomas Wolfe, the writer who couldn't stop talking ans writing and living at his fullest, but in truth he is just another histrionic wild man who needs the straight man to keep him on the path.Great performances from all involved. Jude Law was perfect for the role. It is almost unimaginable to think that Michael Fassbender was the first choice for the film. Colin Firth was Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman played very well a tragicomic character, the person who lives at the feet of greatness, feasting on someone else's brilliance.The structure of the film was a bit formulaic, a dramatic cliché of men focused on their work while their women nag and wail, but as far as I know it may very well have been the case. It's one of those movies about crazy writers that makes you want to write yourself and to question your comfortable yet bland life."
