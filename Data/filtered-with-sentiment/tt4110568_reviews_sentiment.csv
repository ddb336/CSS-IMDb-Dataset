" Dysfunctionality seems to be the focus for Akhtar
",0.0,-0.8791,2021-04-05 00:00:00,3,"This film was replete with poor acting that is based on a childish script. It shows the dichotomy of the Indian persona that has been created by 300 years under the British Raj. The characters all want to be British but at the same time go around calling one another ""Dude"" while wearing the trappings of US society. The story is based on a dysfunctional family that tries to blend in old traditions with a changing society and expectations. It fails miserably!"
" Just that one scene the song Galan Goodiyan
",0.0,0.1984,2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,The scene with all the characters partying taken in 1 shot! Crazy!
" Good realistic acting from all
",0.4404,0.624,2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,I found this film a breath of fresh air from the typical bollywood fakeness and overdramatic acting. This film felt more like how bormal people would react and behave. It felt more connected to the audience and we need more films like this. I understand Bollywood fans love the over the top everything but I think that audience is fading away and the next generation want to relate to stories. Directors know this yet continue to make those with no substance.
" Every family is dysfunctional in some ways, it's time we sort them out
",0.0,0.9491,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
It's a Zoya's movie so keeping the hopes high is welcomed. The movie viewing experience was mostly pleasant, with good actors together, well balanced screenplay, live locations, well executed and directed. The movie is filled with humor, exciting places, family and lots of fun in between. One of zoya's movie is the cinematography and good writing, which are prevalent in her movies. Despite being a multiple casted movie of very popular actors they are a character not a star or a popular face. The movie is layered, with each individual dealing with the crisis or issue. The use of dog as a storytelling is fresh. Overall, it's a family movie and a happy ending after all, but the movie as a whole is dysfunctional and this movie is their journey, their relationships and their life together.
What did not work:
Firstly I would take out most or all the songs from the movie. Secondly, the length of the movie is long which could have been handled if they cut down the songs.
Final verdict: recommended"
" One word ""simply wow""
",0.5859,0.9331,2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,One the best romance drama in Bollywood and really that acting was awesome and length of the film is 2:40 hrs is little bit draggy if you adjust to that speed movie will be awesome. I don't know why there is lot of negatives to this film but still it's a beautifully crafted film.
" Loved it!!
",0.6688,-0.2271,2020-11-27 00:00:00,9,Loved the movie. It's not just entertaining and lighthearted but it's also very relatable and deals with family problems and equations.
" Started off well, ended so bad
",-0.4005,0.9398,2020-10-02 00:00:00,5,"The film has great cast, brave dialogues. Although it spells out a bit too much, it was going good with its theme, characterizations, location, back story, story and all. But soon it started becoming unrealistic and the ending was so bad. The happy ending could have been shown in a nicer way instead of this logicless way. It seemed the writer couldn't connect the dots but wanted a happy ending and so abruptly turned it into a comedy. It made no sense."
" worth watching
",0.2263,0.9808,2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"Just loved this movie.. it will create a plot on ur mind and it will make u think on many points in real life like how some people are facing things no matter how rich n well settled family they belong. it gives a message to the parents that they have to set their children free and allow them to do what they want to do. and give ur children some support when they want it badly... its all they need sometimes.
just beautifully presented with best acting of ranveer and priyanka"

" Must watch
",0.0,0.9821,2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,This is a family drama movie. Quite funny and very realistic. This is a classic and masterpiece of Bollywood. Bollywood should make more movies like this. Loved the lines of Pluto Mehra. Javed Akhter is great actually. Loved everyone's performances too. And Zoya Akhter is always amazing.
" Well performed and well executed story-line
",0.4939,0.9412,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"A multi star cast film with great great performances by all the actors. The story carries a great message and simultaneously it has the element of natural entertainment. Though it is a family drama film but well-executed and not at all cliched. I can binge watch it anytime because of some fantastic scenes of 'Mehra' Family. Most importantly I will mention, the entire film is shown from a perspective of a 'Dog' which is out of the ordinary. Not a film to be missed."
" Brilliant movie ðŸ‘Œ
",0.5859,0.8402,2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,Definetely worth multiple watch. Good music and best part are the characters in the movie.

" A Good Film! (For the most part)
",0.4926,0.9678,2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"The film revolves around a rich family and their internal problems. For the world, they are the perfect family, which is not actually the case however.I loved the way how the shallowness of the characters was depicted throughout the film. Nobody wants to talk about their true emotions because of the fear of ""society"". Even though the story is about an upper class family, it is quite relatable across all classes.While the film is entertaining, it does feel a bit stretched at times. The songs are forgettable except one. The climax could definitely have been better.Overall it is a fun, light film and can be watched with your family.A lot of positive things to take away from!"
" All about life & love
",0.6369,0.8316,2020-05-12 00:00:00,7,"I like this director's movies a lot, although I'm watching it after several years after its release, it still looks a bit fresh as it portrays the lives of people which feels so close and real while the film showcases the human emotions, connections & relationships, which is obviously about to change after COVID-19 and films like these will look like gems in upcoming years to live."
" A feel good entertainer that turns every clich into something interesting
",0.802,0.9695,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"First of all, this movie does not deserve the hate it is given here. It seriously needs a higher rating. I was expecting it to be above 8 but BANG... it is just 6.4 NOT FAIR. Oh ok coming to the movie...
This movie depicts the problems in a dysfunctional family in a beautiful way. We have seen several South Indian movies where hero enters a house with large family and solves all the problem. Son of Sardar also dwelved into the same concept. But here the house is converted into cruise and the way ship moves to different places in the world acts as the metaphor for the character arc of the protagonist family. There are several hard hitting scenes. A bit of less exopsing and kissing scenes would have made it even more family friendly. Coming to the performances, Anil kapoor is brilliant and so is Ranveer Singh(although not on par with the performances in his later movies) as a goofy person(the scenes where he reacts to the other people the one where he gives a knife to a lady and confronts his parents are the highly enjoyable scenes of the movie).
The ladies(PC and her mother character) have also done a commendable job. Amir khan as the narrator dog is funny.
The women empowerment message is subtle and delivered crystal clear. However, there are two many supporting characters other than the main family and their predicament is explained in a rushed maneer which makes us unable to relate to them and the film suffers from a weak climax which despite neatly wrapping up is more filmy."
" Didn't like it at all
",-0.2755,-0.3089,2020-02-24 00:00:00,1,"This type of movie should not be made I think. Because only 0.1% people of the society will understand and relate to the culture of the people in this movie.
There is nothing special to talk about this movie actually."
" Ranveer's insipid performance
",-0.4588,0.6877,2020-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Shefali shah, Anil Kapoor, Priyanka chopra acted very well in this decently written movie.
If not for lackluster performance of Ranveer Singh, this movie could have been easily an 8* movie .
5 stars !!!"
" Nice Film
",0.4215,0.9735,2020-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Its really nice film. Actors are effortless !! :) Zoya Akhtar is superb to deal with this kind of genre. Priyanka is superb, Farhan is brilliant. Anil Kapoor is amazing."
" Zoya never disappoints!
",0.3561,0.966,2020-01-12 00:00:00,8,My Rating : 8/10'Dil Dhadakne Do' is everything I want from a Zoya Akhtar movie - rich people and their stupid problems!An awesome Bollywood mainstream drama-romance that is a visual treat right from the first shots.And Pluto is easily the smartest character - superb film and highly recommended!
" Neo thoughts killed the story
",-0.6705,-0.5346,2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,"A wealthy couple of Delhi, mehra family, gets 30 anniversary. Her daughter plans a trip to Greece and turkey with other wealthy families.At first we can understand the childish characters of mehra's son and daughter by daughter name not in invitation card who is married to sangh family.Next, the company mehra is getting bankrupt so father plans to sell his plane to save the company. But, the 25yo son cries to not sell it.These kids establishing their neo thoughts and exaggerated feminism to their parents during the trip. It made a chaos among the families.

" fun, eye candy movie, and very well made too!
",0.7171,0.9925,2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie was surprisingly refreshing and heart warming. Very well made. Good acting, good direction, very well made overall. Ranveer Singh shines through with his fun, natural, flawless acting. There are scenes throughout the movie such as when the whole family is in the lifeboat being chased by the ship's crew and Ranveer tells his mom to relax and she hysterically screams back at him, ""you just shut up!"" - that is so realistic and yet hilarious at the same time! The idea of having the family dog narrating the story is fun and novel, and well delivered. And to top that, fabulous locales and beautifully dressed characters are all eye candy for sure :-) Must watch movie!"
" Farhan Akhtar is anti India

" Classic!
",0.0,0.9258,2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,Have watched this movie over and over again! Such a fun story with hilarious characters. Priyanka and Ranveer are the best brother-sister duo. The casting director did a good job to fit all the characters. It felt like I was in the movie because of all the chaos and drama that goes down on the Cruise with relatable characters. The movie has such a simple story but that's the beauty of it because it's all about the emotions. It's all about the heart. Dil Dhadakne Do!
" A photo-realistic modern family drama and a wonderful satire of picture-perfect cinematic families...
",0.5719,0.9371,2019-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Been a fan of Zoya Akhtar's work and this might be her best cinematic venture. The way it acts as family drama while satiring the bland genre is what makes this movie stand out. Every character feels real and humane. It fills the screen with practical albeit flawed characters and makes you fall in love them. With its lush cinematography and excellent music, the movie carves its silhouette in your heart.."

" Underrated Film That Is Well Worth Watching
",0.4588,0.9938,2018-10-05 00:00:00,9,"Ayesha (Priyanka Chopra) and Kabir (Ranveer Singh) join friends and family on a cruise to celebrate the 30th wedding anniversary of their parents Kamal (Anil Kapoor ) and Neelam (Shefali Shah). Kamal is overbearing, and both parents are strictly traditional, as well as worrying about what others think of their family. In addition, their marriage is less than successful. During the voyage, the siblings both go against their parents wishes in matters of love, creating more discord in their family.This is not a lighthearted movie, though it does contain some humor and romance. It is, instead, a serious drama about family dynamics, expectations, and acceptance. The plot is rich and well-written. The music and choreography are average. Kapoor gives a stellar performance as the tightly-strung, controlling father. I had previously only seen Chopra in the rom-com setting, and was pleasantly surprised by her ability to play a deeper role. Both Singh and Shah are also convincing in their roles. Rahul Bose plays Ayesha's husband, and does a fine job with varying emotions. The movie also stars Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar, and both give credible performances. I was impressed by this underrated film and found it to be just about perfect. This is one I certainly recommend.Cast also includes Aamir Khan, Zarina Wahab, Vikrant Massey and Ridhima Sud, among others."
" Brilliant storytelling
",0.5859,0.7506,2018-09-09 00:00:00,9,Zoya Akhtar has a great type of storytelling which reflects in each of her film. She handles each and every character carefully and each character is given an arc and proper screen time. It's a fine movie about family relations and can be watched again and again.
" This film is golden. There is no such thing as a normal family.
",-0.296,0.9886,2018-06-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not about rich people. It's about family problems.The entertaining way to tell a story is to make caricature characters and make them go through a plot such as D3. Zoya and Rima does just that.I could relate to Ranveer's character so it made the movie even more fun to watch. Chip on your shoulder, the family prestige, even though you think you are meant for other things in life. The game playing he does in this movie also shows that people like his character and me are not ready to be fully adults. That's one of the problems! Because age wise, we are already adults.This movie also has another lead. The sister of Ranveer played by Priyanka Chopra.Through her we see that women liberation is still fighting to get equal footing. It does not matter if you were born in he slum or. in her case, a mansion.I really liked the curve balls through at her character and how gracefully she overcame them.Looking at the parents, reminded me of mine. Bias, sometimes horrifyingly selfish and borderline mean. But that's the thing. They are humans too. Not just our parents. We come to realize this as the movie progresses. Shefali Shah is an amazing talent and on par with Anil Kapoor. They both do an amazing job! The looks of this film! It was a treat to watch the cinematography! I don't know how Zoya does it. But she does this quite well : She adds lots of colors to the screen, but still keeps it classy. Not tacky. But how? Now that's magic.The music is good. I still listen to Pehli Baar late at night when I am busy working. Bring mojo to my work.Phir Bhi Yeh Zindagi is a heart cracking song. It should get to you. It's a humane song. This movie is golden. Society will judge us either way. Rich people actually have more to loose because of the invisible prestige they carry and are subject to scrutiny by peers and alike just as anyone. Even their family. But you get one life you live. You got to let your heart beat..."
" A beautiful masterpiece.

" Family is everything
",0.0,0.9418,2018-05-12 00:00:00,9,"A couple celebrates their 30 th marriage anniversary with family and friends on a Mediterranean cruise. An indifferent couple, their unhappily married daughter and an immature son. This is the story of families all around the world. The trials and tribulations they go through and come together.The movie is excellently cast. All give a superb performance especially Shefali Shah. The screenplay is to the point and precise. The pacing of the story is great. We just have to accept the over the top moments in all Bollywood movies because that's what the people want. This movie could be edited better but still a worthy effort."
" Dil Dhadakne Do, a visual treat.

With lots of laugh out loud moments director Zoya Akhtar, combine a bunch of crazy characters in a cinematic masterpiece.Though the reviewers feels this is same as any romcom in the past, but, you must not miss it. At the end you will leave with a smile in your face."
" Held my attention
",0.0,0.5849,2018-01-23 00:00:00,6,"I give this movie a thumbs up only because it held my attention for more than 20 minutes ( which is more than what I can say about any ' b'ollywood ' hit ' film )A finely etched study of the varying dynamics between different members of the same family, manipulations , secrets & personal motivations that drive diplomacy , keeping-up-appearances , politics & power-play between in-laws , family friends & business partners.Zoya Akhtar was doing very well until she botched the end of the movie weakly in a schmaltzy finish."
" New theme, great execution except ending, side order of male bashing
",0.6249,0.971,2017-12-29 00:00:00,5,"The movie is quite different and the story has a theme - unlike most recent comedies. Except for the end, it is very well executed. The end reverts to filmy craziness but oh well.Most starts have delivered compelling performances. I was pleasantly surprised by a mature and measured performance from Ranveer Singh who otherwise does action hero roles. Farhan Akhtar looks too old (with wrinkles around his eyes) to play a role in Ranveer-Priyanka generation. He looks more like Priyanka's ""chacha"" than a boy-friend. But hey, he is the director's brother!Note for the PC-wary: Zoya Akhtar seems to have used this as an opportunity for a lot of male bashing. Women are largely shown as poor victims or fighters against patriarchy with an added dash of Hindu-Muslim match up. Typical liberal drivel that infects bollywood ""liberally""."
" Terrible overrated film!
",-0.5255,-0.9239,2017-10-16 00:00:00,1,"This film was awful! The story was complete nonsense. Like most Bollywood films, the film had no logic, but this one has absolutely nothing in it! Rich people making up problems where there exist none and problems so fake and unrealistic, they can only happen in Bollywood. The acting over the top, dialogues and jokes were pathetic and that dog, why?! You know awards are bought in the industry when Anil Kapoor wins a Filmfare for his performance in this film. That's 3 hours of my life I'm never getting back."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.8832,2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Film was totally amazing characters,story,songs and especially Anil Kapoor,Farhan Akhter and Priyanka Chopra acting,there should also be an sequel continuing the story or after the events.The film was reality based and no special effects like in other films are seen,all the characters should be praised in the film and directors,producers and writers."
