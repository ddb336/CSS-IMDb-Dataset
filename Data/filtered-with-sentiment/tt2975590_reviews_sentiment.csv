" Watch the extended cut.
",-0.2732,0.8931,2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,I really dig the extended cut. You won't miss any point that you might've missed in theatrical release.Just like as Snyder cut of Justice league is far better than the theatrical justice league and opens all the points that we miss in theatrical movie. Warner Bros should give the complete freedom to the movie makers.Studio should stop messing around with these movies.
" An extended cut that deserved to be seen.
",-0.2732,0.9821,2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"This review will be based off of the ultimate editionBatman v Superman is a very divisive film. Snyder roots these characters in Miller's interpretation of them which were, quite frankly, a lot divisive. For the first time, people got to see what it would be actually living in Gotham everyday. And it wasn't a very bright picture. Snyder did just the same, but in a way that many would argue, is overdone.Positives:
I really don't have a problem with the story. It's a good story that shows Lex as mastermind. Even though he has no powers, he could kill any superhero he wants.Affleck's Batman is quite possibly the strongest interpretation of the caped crusader. I loved the armoured suit and the white digital eyes (first bat to do so). And for the first time he does some actual detective work.Beautiful visuals. As much as you hate Snyder, even his worst critic would have to agree that his cinematography is visually stunning. Though muted colours may not suit everyone's taste, the images his creates are more than enough to cover it. He literally draws this pictures and bring them to the big screen.Cavill's superman was ok. He is a good superman, but his face doesn't change in the entire film. The man literally has only one emotion.Eisenberg's Lex is more like a joker. All those small voices, his tingly walk and his weird antics would make him a better joker than Lex. Lex is supposed to quite, broody and always thinking. But he is acceptable.Negatives:Could you please show me more batman and superman fights! That's what I signed up for.Martha scene could've been executed better. Like I like the idea of Batman realising that superman is more human than he ever was but ""Save Martha"" wasn't the way to go.More Knightmare required.Wonder Woman looks like she was forcibly put in the film. I don't mind her, but I wanted BvS.All in all, BvS is a good film. Neither a masterpiece nor a total garbage. I enjoyed watching it and I reckon many DC fans will too.Verdict: B-"

If you believe yes, then this movie isn't for you.Batman V Superman... I think that this title might have been what led people to misinterpret this movie so much and the sole reason for all the hate. This movie is basically Man of Steel 2 with Batman as the anti-hero."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.7964,2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Another Masterpiece from Zack Snyder, maybe this is my favorite movie of all time."
" Not like your daily ""formulative"" Superhero Movies
",-0.2755,-0.9825,2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"This review is for that extended version ofcourse. It was not like other sunshine and rainbow superhero movies that applies the same formula again and again, I saw the SUPERMAN the Ultimate being struggle THE BATMAN The Justice making bad judgements but that was made because it hold a character development and the way the movie goes if you pay attention you do understand that this Superman is not at his peak he's just a newbie and Batman has changed during this time he's old and is dealing with lot of issues not the Perfect Duo that we've always been seeing all the time. This is an art, an experiment that was perfectly executed by the artist Zack Snyder and his team, the way Ben Affleck plays the role of Bruce Wayne is just pure perfection fights crime at night and a cocky billionaire in the public, and the struggle that Clark was going though no one can portray that better than Henry Cavill he's still trying to fit into this world which has mixed thoughts about him and most of them hates him as they think he causes destruction and doesn't care about human lives he's being treated like an outsider, I can go on with the thongs like how his death changed Bruce's thinking and how the world understood that He was more of a human than they could ever be and a lot of things but this is an Art like I said you'll have to watch it and it's worth the time. Zack Snyder's DC Movies are not like your everyday comic movies it's different and it's logical because it does show the reality."
" Wonderful visuals and complicated storyline
",0.5719,0.9224,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Aside from the Martha line, the movie is beautifully constructed with deep character motivations and smart build up, the climax is ultimately unsatisfying, but regardless, the wonderful character beat and filmatography just make this movie my personal favorite superhero movie of all time."
" An epic, but flawed movie
",0.0,-0.6383,2021-03-28 00:00:00,9,"First let me say that the Extented Cut is the way to go. It's superb compared to the Theatrical Cut.When I watched this movie back in 2016 I enjoyed it, but nothing more than that. Now that I have watched the movie again 5 years later (now as the extended) I have to say that I love this movie. The way it handles the terror and dread that's felt when a god roams the earth is really cool. ""False god"" on Superman's statue, anti-Superman protesters outside the City Hall, it's all really intriguing.The fight between Batman and Superman is marvelously done and goddamn does Batman's Mech Suit look amazing!!! Hell, this whole movies looks fantastic.Though as said in the title, this movie is also flawed. There are some plotholes here and there and some character motivations don't make perfect sense sometimes, but in the end this movie really satisfies me and it's just epic."
" This is a 9 or 10 easy
",0.4404,0.9327,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Please watch the unedited/extended cut (~3 hours duration). You will not regret it!! If you enjoyed Zack Snyder's new Justice League film, you will love this movie as it is the prequel."

" Ultimate Edition review: The movie that should've been released in theatres
",0.0,0.9933,2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Its no surprise that ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" was a commercial and critical disappointment during its original theatrical release - while a movie featuring two of the most popular superheroes of all time was a seemingly surefire billion dollar opportunity, the dark and relentlessly bleak tone proved to be aversive to audiences and critics alike. While ""Man of Steel"" managed to at least feel uplifting, even with its plethora of last-act destruction, ""Batman v Superman"" is dour from the outset, beginning and ending with death and tragedy. People unfamiliar with Zack Snyder's more gritty, grounded take on the hero genre were unimpressed, feeling none of the excitement, thrills, and sense of fun that Marvel films are so good at conveying. It underperformed at the box office, obtained a dismal ""B"" rating from audiences according to Cinemascore, and dropped a historic 81.6% during its second Friday, and a 69.1% in its second weekend. Then the damage control started.Seemingly immediately, WB released a deleted scene on YouTube, and the three-hour extended cut was announced. And, to the surprise to many, it received much better reviews from both professional critics and mainstream audiences. With added context and buildup to the fight between Batman and Superman, and the inclusion of previously removed scenes that add coherency to the plot, the extended edition fixed many of the original film's problems, while maintaining the controversial tone and alternative, darker view of the characters.The Ultimate Edition is a better film, without a doubt. As I mentioned, it has many additional scenes that add much-needed context to plot occurrences, and that even completely change the way scenes are interpreted. Additionally, the extended cut offers scenes of Clark Kent investigating the Batman, showing that, just as Batman fears Superman, Superman himself is not a fan of the way Batman is purposefully striking fear into the heart of not only criminals but also Gotham City's civilians. It's a very effective way to show the dichotomy between characters, whereas it is Batman's objective to scare others, Superman does so accidentally through his otherworldly powers. The Ultimate Edition sets up their conflict well, showing two very different characters who are struggling to find their place in the world they live in.Ben Affleck's Batman is my favorite Batman so far. His brutality in the costume is unmatched - the film explains how he has been fighting crime for 20 years, and as Bruce Wayne so succinctly puts it, ""Criminals are like weeds. Pull one up, another grows in its place."" This is a tired, weathered, and mentally deteriorated Bruce Wayne who believes that his legacy depends on killing Superman, the only man in the world who could destroy the earth without lifting a finger. Ben Affleck's portrayal as both Batman and Bruce Wayne is unlike any so far depicted on film, and I loved watching this new take on an old character. Batman isn't afraid to seemingly kill the criminal henchman who stands in his way, and it made sense with how the movie introduced his mindset and outlook on life; as one civilian in Gotham tells Clark, ""He is angry, and he is hunting.""Henry Cavill also plays a layered Superman, one who doesn't understand how to cope with having the power of a god, still not having the capability to save everyone. He is surrounded by people who either revere or despise him, people who treat him as a messiah, and others who treat him as a demon. And whether people love or hate him, Henry Cavill's Superman seems to understand both perspectives. This is a character who wants to be seen as good, but knows that as long as innocent people are suffering, someone, somewhere will still find a way to call him evil. Seeing Clark attempt to put an end to Batman's reign of terror was interesting, and fit his character well, adding emotional resonance to the inevitable fight between them at the end.Zack Snyder does a great job showing two faulted heroes, both of whom are deeply flawed and are simply trying to do what they feel is right. I enjoyed watching this darker, more adult take, but I understand why others did not - superhero films are usually meant as escapism, but Snyder decided to take these characters and place them into the real world, filling this film with political conversations and senate hearings. And, in fact, a large majority of this film does feel like a political thriller - until, of course, the action starts.""Batman v Superman"" has some of the best, most intense action I have ever seen in a movie. From a thrilling car chase involving Batman and and a small army of criminals, to the titular fight between Batman and Superman, to a warehouse battle where Batman takes on a handful of criminals by himself, Snyder helms every action scene expertly, utilizing a distinct visual flair to add brutality and impact to the violence. Batman throws people into walls, leaving a smear of blood upon impact; he fires machine guns from the Batmobile, uncaring whether or not he leaves a trail of bodies in his wake; he stabs, crushes, and even shoots, and all of looks beautiful, thanks to Snyder's visual eye, filmed in nice steady, wide shots that let you feast on the action. There is truly spectacular action at play here, which is unfortunately mired by the overstuffed running time and hectic conclusion.Even though the three-hours really gives this film much-needed breathing room and critical plot information, the movie still feels too long for its own good. There were certainly many scenes that could've been cut out of this film, and in doing so, I believe the movie would've been much better received, with a tighter narrative and faster pace. Additionally, the climax of this film offers just as much of, if not more destruction as ""Man of Steel."" And while it is entertaining, the final CGI-filled fight is just a little too much - there is so much happening at once, and so many special effects, that it's honestly a bit tiring to watch. That said, because of the epic three-hour run time, the film does manage to convey everything it wants, naturally including and resolving many plot points in a thematically satisfying manner.""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - Ultimate Edition"" is one of my favorite superhero films, mostly due to Snyder's grittier take and Affleck's darker Batman. I really enjoy watching this movie, and I never find myself bored of the action or character interactions. It is nicely paced, with only a few scenes that seem jarring or randomly included. However, with the recent release of ""Zack Snyder's Justice League,"" I can foresee a renewed popularity and appreciation of this film. More of a dramatic character study than an action film, ""Batman v Superman"" will be sure to please those who enjoy Snyder's style and don't mind a unique take on classic characters."
" The Extended cut ain't bad
",0.1901,0.9729,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,Yes this film had way too much stuffed into and is trying to be about 3 different films and Lex Luthors films plan is ridiculously over complicated. Other then that it's a pretty cool film. Some cool action sequences and a good score by Hans Zimmer. It's a solid watch for superhero fans. Ben Affleck actually makes a pretty good batman and is probably better. I just wish we got a proper Snyder Batman film rather then this Man of Steel 2/ Batman /Lex Luther crazy plan / Justice League setup movie.
" I wish extended was the theatrical cut. It deserved 8+ rating!
",0.2244,0.3252,2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"It's sad to see this movie sitting at a rating of 6.4. This should be a 8+ title. I've watched the extended cut again, and it is a wonderful movie.Affleck showed great performance and maintained the seriousness of the character that Batman is.This is a story of Man vs God and then man realizing that how wicked they are.Watch the extended cut, you won't regret spending 3 hours on this."
" So sad
",-0.5256,0.5742,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,First movie I really really did not like wow what happened ???I cant get over the superman actor and the plot missing inbetween or louises actor. She would be better in spiderman. ..not much is consistent.. very dark barely any positive superman movie or hero movie as they were.

" Ultimate edition is the vision of director, dont ever go for theatrical cut
",-0.0258,0.9762,2021-03-26 00:00:00,9,"WB studios if you want to churn money take some other director rather than spoiling the vision of Synder. The theatrical cut is a mess, bulk of scenes make no sense. The ultimate edition is no masterpiece either it has its lows like plot holes and the lex luthor, but at the same time has a lot to offer definitely better than every marvel movie(barring 2-3). It is the kind of movie you appreciate more after each subsequent viewing. If you even remotely love dark-noir movies or a fan of dc in general it is a must watch."
" I vote for ultimate edition
",0.0,0.8399,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"30 minute plus, better pacing, perfectly connected, more emotional."
" Underrated Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9681,2021-03-25 00:00:00,9,I watched it yesterday and I was absolutely blown away from the greatness of this movie. I didn't only learn to never trust critics again but also that I slept big time on the DCEU. The Snyder Cut will be the next on my watchlist and Im so ready for it. Thank you BvS and Zack Snyder for turning me into a big superman fan(really never expected that) and also to give me the final push after MOS to make me a DCEU fan. We live in a society in where I will watch DCs future with great interest. At least if you restore the Snyderverse(looking at you WB).
" Not fake like Marvel !

" The moments that are great outweigh the movie's flaws
",0.6249,0.9594,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, although from a movie production perspective, it's got quite some flaws. The movie I feel has a bit of a pacing problem, but when it does arrive at certain moments, it has quite an impact. The set-up behind the conflict between the two heroes, and their view on things and each other, I think is done really well. And although the pacing at times may interrupt the flow of that story, seeing it unravel and work itself out is really satisfying. And the visuals. Damn. If you just like a good popcorn movie with visuals that just overwhelm you, the visuals alone are worth seeing it. Yes, the movie has its flaws, but the ultimate moments that pay-off are vastly greater than its flaws."
" One of the Best CBM of All Time!
",0.6696,0.9758,2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry. Honestly as a big fan of DC this is one of my favorite DCEU film.
" Almost perfect
",0.5279,0.83,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Ultimate edition is better than cinematographic one, few more minutes that help you to understand better the plot."
" Watch again after Snyder Cut of Justice League.
",0.3182,0.9855,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I'd previously rated this film as a 6. I found the it quite disappointing when I saw it at the cinema on its release.I found the theatrical release of justice League even more of a let down.However, the new Zach Snyder cut of Justice League is brilliant. After watching I decided to go back and watch the ultimate extended edition of Batman V Superman.This time round I enjoyed the film so much more. The interweaving story line from the knightmare timeline and the upcoming arrival of steppenwolf in Justice League made so much more sense.
The characters felt more complete and the story as whole was a lot more enjoyable.
I was genuinely surprised how much more I appreciated this film after seeing the Snyder cut of justice League.
As such, I recommend you give it another go if you felt let down before like I did. Your may well find a new appreciation for this movie.Just to reiterate, I watched the extended ultimate cut, so I'd recommend watching the same for the fully fleshed out story."
" Zach Snyders dawn of the justice league
",0.5267,0.3041,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"I've never seen any of the theatrical versions of dawn of justice or justice league, mainly because of the horrible reviews. I recently subscribed to hbo max and saw that Zach Synders was releasing his uncut version. I quickly watched the extended version then proceeded to watch the uncut version. Instantly top 4 DC movies EVER MADE. Ben Affleck brings batman to life in a way that is so believable. That fight between Superman and Batman at the end still gives me chills. 9/10"

Another good super hero flick.
" A well-crafted Masterpiece !! (The Ultimate edition one)
",0.6892,0.9169,2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"If you're going to see the ultimate edition each and every moment will make point and you'll be bound to be intrigued by the film. Zack Snyder has created a masterpiece which is beyond imagination. Every detail counts. Writing, screenplay and camera actions are so much vivid and awesome which makes it a treat to watch visually."

Just like Justice League, the directors cut is superior. Plus you got Cavill back as Superman, the best live action Batman in Ben Affleck and a great live action debut of Wonder Woman."
" Robocop Vs Shoveman
",0.0,0.7096,2021-03-23 00:00:00,3,"What's happened? This film has a brilliant opportunity to make it a classic film especially Zack Snyder on the director's chair after seeing Watchmen that got me hyped up. The story and acting were dullfest, great film to help you fall asleep though. Nobody looks like wanted to be in the film. I enjoyed Batman And Robin better than this. Then when it come to the 'epic' smashdown between two icon superheroes. What a letdown. Batman was basically Robocop (metal suit and slow speed), whilst Superman was throwing Batman about for no reason. All Superman has to do was hold Batman's arms down and explain the situation of Luther's plan. No, it had dull short fight then shouted their mother's name for when Superman was getting his ass beating by Robocop which apparently they both got the same mother's name (hooray) then they became best friend. Avoid this, and hope Warner Brothers some point will do remake of this that we want. I used to believe Tim Burton's Planet Of The Apes, Steven Spielberg's War Of The World and The Matrix Reloaded were the biggest disappointment until BvS came along. Wasted."
" The extended cut is much better, but still flawed.
",0.1027,0.8576,2021-03-23 00:00:00,7,"It really is worth the extra time to watch the extended cut, because the normal release is much more convoluted and riddled with plot and technical issues. The extended cut gives a little more clarity, but still is one of the worst written from having too much filler and lacking in more substance. Many critics weren't a fan of Eisenberg's character/performance, but without him, there would hardly be any substance to the film. I for one enjoyed his performance as well. Other than that, the casting and performances were great, and the S/VFX and score on point. If you haven't seen Man of Steel, I really emphasize you should watch that first, otherwise you'll be lost. Then watch Zack Snyders Justice League for the trifecta of the main guts of the DCEU story-lines. To me, none of the Wonder Woman's, Harley/Suicide Squad's, Aquaman's or Shazam are canonical or have much effect on the main 3 DCEU movies, only having a few quick cameos and non-canonical backstories. The almost 10 hour binge investment on just the 3 aforementioned films will satisfy any super-hero DC fans."
" Ultimate Edition is a much improved director's extended version cut
",0.25,0.8674,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Still just not enough action for me. Too much CGI for a Batman movie. But, while the C.

Batman wasn't living up to his name in my opinion. And then Zach Snyder's cut of the Justice League came out.... Holy smokes what a turn around! The beginning of that new JL movie showing the end of BvS left me curious to look up this BvS movie again. I saw that a bunch of people were leaving it with 10/10 for the extended cut. So I figured I'd give it a shot to clarify the new JL. And oh boy this was good! Not sure what the differences are between the original and extended, but I enjoyed every moment of this movie. And Batman had some dope scenes.Biggest complaint, the actor for lex luthor is more of a Joker character and doesn't fit Lex Luthor at all. And whenever I see batman in the mask, his face looks fat and then I am thinking of him as fat. And the flash, yes I know he's not in here, but he doesn't act like flash or look like him. Nor is there supposed to be this huge age gap between him and everyone else."

" Ultimate Edition 9/10--Theaterical Version 3/10
",0.0,0.5749,2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"The Ultimate Edition of this film changes this movie from a disjointed mess to a long, grim coherent epic. It's still a little messy in places but I think this film is given too much hate for not having enough humor or lighter moments that the MCU endures.
But that is not the purpose of this film nor the DCEU in general. What makes this film and all of the Zack Snyder DCEU films unique is because they are outside the box and maintain one man's vision of these characters. Do I agree with all of his vision? No, Lex Luther is a terrible villain and the 3rd act of this film really falls flat in many areas, but the first two acts along with its story is really profound and beautifully made.
Overall, if you want a film that represents a comic book coming to life, this is the movie for you. If you want light-hearted popcorn entertainment, then I recommend you changing the channel and skip out on this one. However, as a superhero fan, this is one of the most accurately depicted comic book films of all time and absolutely one of my favorites."

In my opinion, Ben Affleck and Jesse Eisenberg make a special contribution to the film, although all the roles are very well chosen (and even though I am more a fan of Superman :P).

" Makes more sense on second viewing
",0.0,-0.9812,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"I didn't really like this film when I saw the theatrical cut on Prime for the first time. I was hoping to see Superman and Batman fight each other for 2 hours. I didn't need them to have a reason to fight. I just wanted them to fight over the most trivial reason. After all, I am watching the film for that very reason. Then why aren't they doing it? And on top of it the quality of the movie was also terrible. The audio was too low to be understood without subtitles, the video was too dark, there was too much talking, no Snyder-ish thing was happening most of the time, even their fight didn't seem like Zack Snyder's work (the warehouse fight looked more like it). And the Doomsday fight looked forced. And in the movie titled Batman v Superman the fight between the two legends lasts for barely 10 minutes after which they just say Martha and the fight ends.People often have a problem with this movie because Batman was killing everyone and Superman looked very gloomy. But personally I didn't mind that, since I hadn't watched any Batman movies before (this was my 2nd DC movie after Man of Steel) so I didn't know Batman has a no kill rule, and I didn't like the happy underwear-on-pants Superman (it's the very reason why I wanted Batman to beat up Superman in this movie). Henry Cavill's Superman is the reason why I started liking Superman in the first place. I also do not have any problem with Lex Luthor since I liked the way he spoke; he sounded a bit like Shah Rukh Khan. And also because I hadn't seen Lex Luthor before, so I just saw him as an original character.But afterwards I watched the Ultimate Edition with subtitles, and this time I was paying more attention to the other characters instead of waiting for the two heroes to beat out each other the way I thought they would do. I think this is something common in all the Zack Snyder movies - you can only appreciate them if you already know the story. Because then you pay more attention to the visual appeal and how cool everyone and everything is looking. Their dialogues now made more sense, since I could read the subtitles instead of struggling with the volume. I was patiently looking at each and every scene. All the pieces that didn't connect in the theatrical version, most of them did in the Ultimate Edition.In my opinion the theatrical version should have never existed. I mean this movie is based on two of the world's most powerful superheroes. Why wouldn't people want to see it no matter how long it runs for? And since it made more sense, more people would have seen it, because of which it would have earned more."
" DC Have Lost The Plot
",-0.3182,-0.9947,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,Weakest story line ever. Batman hates Superman but why? Because he assumes one day he's going to go bad. Well we all know what assumptions get us. He eventually battles Superman and nests only to stop because their mothers have the same name. And all of a sudden they are best friends. Does that mean he won't go bad now? Terrible writing. Obviously written for 12 year old kid.Been Affleck as Batman is a terrible choice and why does who look so fat? Is he wearing a bat suit or a day suit?Lex Luther is TERRIBLE. Who in their right mind decided to cast this guy as Lex????? HE IS TERRIBLE.And what's with Doomsday? Another disaster from DC and hugely missed opportunity to introduce Doomsday. He should have been introduced as he was in the death of Superman comics but no they stuffed it up. So over DC garbageSame your time and energy. And no I'm not a Marvel fan just stick of DC churning out trash

" A Flawed, but Good Movie (Ultimate Edition)
",0.5927,0.9836,2021-03-18 00:00:00,6,"I watched the extended cut of this movie for the very first time last night in preparation of Zack Snyder's Justice League. I had heard extensively of this version being superior to the theatrical cut of this film, so I decided to give it a shot. So, does this cut make this a masterpiece or is it still a mess?Well, the ultimate edition of Batman v Superman is still a mess, but its a watchable mess. The plot is more understandable, the arcs off characters are more fleshed out, and overall flow is better. However, it doesn't fix the significant problems with the general plot, such as the absolute mess of a third act. Lex is significantly improved here. He is still annoying and weird, but now he's actually a semi decent antagonist due to now having a plan that actually makes a little bit of sense (it ain't perfect, though, since some things still don't make sense).As for the actual movie, I found it to be a generally compelling drama for the first 2/3's. I appreciate the themes explored in this movie, and they are handled mostly well in this cut. I really like Superman's arc, and Ben Affleck is fantastic as Batman. The cinematography and score are fantastic, and the action scenes are epic and awesome (mostly). I do feel that characters like Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, and the Senator are a bit underdeveloped. Overall, however, this is a mostly good movie outside of its third act.If you are gonna watch Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, watch the ultimate edition. It vastly improves the characters and pacing."

" Underrated Cult Classic.
",0.0,0.9795,2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Rewatched this (The Ultimate Edition) ahead of ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"" releasing & have to concede the movie's aged incredibly well; far better than I remembered & truly appreciable from start to finish.Surprisingly, although Zack's known for his beautifully choreographed & stylised, visual set pieces... There are two places in particular where his efforts genuinely succeed in this film & they're with the character development & world building. Before the narrative plunges in to weightless CGI confrontations in the third act (which is by far the weakest), what we're treated to in the first half is a layered, philosophical deconstruction of our fascination with the concept of superheroes, contemplating their place within society. It's thought provoking, well articulated, masterfully constructed & concise, striking an impressive balance between substance / spectacle that (as mentioned) does sadly tip towards the encroaching conclusion. Regardless, none of that mandatory action (it's a blockbuster) negates the impact delivered from the powerful moments peppered from beginning to end. They're outstanding, irrespective of the less effective sequences & I loved them nonetheless.However, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the less original, explosive story beats, I still cared for Clark - who's given a really interesting arc, grappling with the responsibility of being ""special"" whilst others constantly question the moral ambiguity of his actions, testing him personally, forcing him to reconcile with his own identity until he's no longer a doubtful, reluctant saviour - instead, accepting who he is / his destiny. The sequel's a forensic analysis of the role he's assigned to play, who designated the part & whether he's fit to fill the position. Pretty weighty stuff... Again, this continues to be a bold Superman origin story & ironically, as the journey his character takes is a gradually paced one (with each chapter plotted in advance), he doesn't truly become the titular, recognisable figure we all know & love until the moment of his death - because in that moment, he reasserts the importance of his values, proving that he's willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good of mankind, establishing himself as the creator of his own destiny, led by nobody other than himself - setting up Justice League perfectly by establishing his future development, signalling to the audience that his rebirth (akin to a phoenix rising from the ashes) will act as the catalyst for solidifying his beloved status.Lois also has difficulty learning how to live with the two men she's dating - the man she fell in love with & the symbol he's suddenly come to represent. That burden puts strain on their romance & consequently, creates compelling emotional conflict throughout. Hence, it's a really strong & engaging dilemma, superior to any climactic battle - no matter how expensive it was to render. Their interactions subsequently make for some of the most intimate, much needed exchanges in the entire project.Then we have Batman whose motivations are grounded in a bitter resentment; growing old, tired & weary of Gotham's criminals after decades of crime fighting, he's lost faith in humanity. Thus, after being met with unrelenting evil, his growing sense frustration births notions of hopelessness that are manifesting in increasingly cruel ways until finally, his obsessions with ridding the world of potential threats are directed towards the Kryptonian he's convinced to loathe - as (to him) his eventual colleague currently embodies the perception of unstoppable darkness that's clouded his judgement. Therefore, Ben Affleck's character is the most developed (with the largest share of noticeable progression) because as the story develops, he learns to see Superman as exactly as the title suggests - a man who just so happens to be super, who is super as a conscious choice, letting his actions define him rather than his abilities - so that realisation (there is good in this world) sparks a new hope in him, resulting in a well earned quest for redemption. It's a rich, complex & daring characterisation I wholeheartedly endorse - the kind of bold, audacious creative choice I love Snyder for making as a filmmaker; he may fail occasionally but his failures are never safe, which is rare & admirable.Contrary to what many may believe, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is actually the stand out of the entire Warner Bros production; his phenomenal portrayal as the unhinged villain is seriously commendable & the unpredictability of his craziness led to outstanding moments of unnerving tension which were scripted perfectly by Chris Terrio & David Goyer. Their construction of his villainy & his reasons for being so unwavering in his endeavours are both sympathetic & believable, adding tragic, humanising depth to him as an individual, preventing the classic foe from seeming shallow or superficial. As a result, even though his depiction may be unconventional, the faultless way in which his downfall plays out on screen is impressive, to say the least. This is a story with no easy answers or two dimensional, inherently good / evil protagonists / antagonists. Men & women do what they believe is right, no matter the cost; each side has power but some are corrupted by it & others are not, yet both willingly make terrible sacrifices in the name of the perceived ""greater good"" - & conflict is organically borne from the disparity between their perspectives."

You talked about the Martha scene which baffled me the most. You said you didn't like it. I just watched it for the fourth time. Before lex luthor commanded him, as a mastermind who just wants to bring up evil and also kill superman, he knew that superman would do anything as long as they don't kill his mum. He didn't want to kill batman, obviously cuz he's a good guy, he only wanted to talk sense into him, but batman was arrogant and wasn't going to listen. Lex luthor said ""Martha, Martha, Martha""
He also uttered ""To save Martha""
Now, straight to the point, batman was about to kill superman, when clark kent already researched about bruce before, he even knew it was him before their fight started.

",0.6908,0.9972,2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm referring to the Ultimate Edition as that's the one I've seen. To give backgrounds, I have not read a single comic book (they're just not for me) but I really enjoy superhero movies and Man of Steel was definitely another excellwnt movie so I was excited to see how BvS would follow and we also got to see Batman and Superman for the first tome together and it mostly delivered.It does a great job of continuing the events of Man of Steel with the actions of Superman being questioned and people wondering if Superman has good intentions and this is exactly what would happen in today's world! It's great seeing actions have consequences and seeing Clark trying to be a hero saving everyone with idiots questioning him in hearings is so compelling and it leads to a great character arc as despite what people say about Clark and the lack of motivation he's getting, he's still a hero and his sacririce in the end proves that and it's definitely one of the best scenes of the movie. And he and Lois have much better chemistry this time around. Their relationship was more believable.Batman is also compelling. I 100% understand why people have trouble with him killing but his actions are treated badly here and he's fallen from this grace. He's turned from this bat vigilante to this killer and it has an effect on him understandably after 20 years of the job and Alfred is not happy with what he's doing and Clark as well finds his actions questionable and he goes through a character arc where he realizes what he's doing as well as his actions toward Superman were wrong (the execution had problems though)Visually, the movie is amazing as expected from Snyder (ok, Doomsday's CGI was bit rough but the dark lighting helped it), its tone is consistent, Affleck and Cavill gave extraodinary acting performances, Adams and Cavill have great chemistry, I like the interactions between Irons and Affleck with the dialogue feeling really natural and I appreciate the darker, more political and mature tone compared to the MCU and maybe even the X-Men, helping it stand out and the action is extraodinary well handled as well as the chilling Hans Zimmer's score.Where the movie really struggles is the pacing. There's little action within the first hours other than one chase in the beginning and two segments where Batman kills a lot of people so it does feel dragged out and not much happens in those two hours, making them feel more of a setup for the last hour and this movie is quite convoluted. It's not comfusing but there's a lot going on. You have the film trying to be a sequel to MoS, a Batman origin movie, you have Lex's secret plan and it also tries to tease us the Justice League with WW being there and clips of Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. If it took out WW and setting up the JL, it would've been loads better.Let's talk about Batman's character arc. The execution is a mess. It does a good job showing his fall from grace mostly but I wished it showed him preparing the battle for Superman more as we don't see him developing the gadgets in the battle and let's talk about the Martha scene, the most misunderstood scene in cinema. The problem was the dialogue and length of the scene. If Martha was replaced with mother and we saw flashbacks of an innocent Batman (as innocent as he can be), it'd be loads better but it felt rushed.I didn't hate Jesse Eissenberg's performance and at least he has a personality and he's entertaining but damn he can be annoying and it feels like a weak attempt to be Heath Ledger's Joker with the craziness. It's just distracting.Despite its obvious flaws, BvS is a good sequel to Man of Steel that left me entertained and I appreciate its ambition despite the flawed execution in places."

Batman killing,from DKR except he shot someone in the face in that.

Bruce is an old bat who shouldn't be killing the movie agrees with you. But this Bruce has lost his way, he is becoming more corrupted as time goes on. Not to mention EVERY Batman has killed but this one has a justification in his own mind, and the story.
Superman is struggling with his obligations as a hero or a civilian.The movie is about how the world sees him, how Batman sees him. How Lex manipulates them.Above all else this movie is about choice.No spoilers but this movie is the most misunderstood and mishated films of all time.

",0.5859,0.9396,2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"After hearing about the ultimate edition, i decided watch it and the amount of details and art work was mind blowing. The story was deep and detailed. After watching this version, I watched the theatrical cut on TV which was annoying, most of the important dialogues and scenes were removed, I found it annoying. This movie is a masterpiece, each and every shot is an artwork. Zack Snyder is one of the best director out there. Keeping aside the fact that climax is a let down, the overall movie is a masterpiece. This movie is darker than usual superhero movies, but it gives us great messages. In this film we can see our favourite heros suffering. It has no element of humour in it, the story is tragic and darker. It shows the real colour of our world. It shows how dark our world could be. The background score is perfect, it provides what this movie requires. It enhances the scenes by creating the atmosphere needed for that scene."
" A decent movie but it should've been much more
",0.0,-0.9966,2021-03-15 00:00:00,6,"The two most famous superheroes of all time up on the big screen together for the first time it should've been a movie that should've been a blockbuster hit. Unfortunately Batman versus Superman:dawn of justice is a decently average Film. The movie has wonderful cinematography and excellent soundtrack from Hans Zimmerman. The action scenes & overall story of the film is what makes the film suffer the most. The film opens with a recap of man of steel we see Bruce Wayne in Metropolis during the events of superman and general Zod in the city. Seeing all the civilian casualties and deaths firsthand at the destruction of Kryptonian's Bruce develops a bias attitude towards Superman and sees him as a threat to humanity. Questioning the fact of superman Poses a threat given how he's worshiped by many as a God, Bruce decides that superman must be dealt with. While superman is faces the challenge of being hated by the public's eyes after being set up for a series of events he is believed to take part in. Starting with the characters themselves Superman overall does not do much for the movie he doesn't question many of the casualties that occurs and doesn't even jump to the fact that someone might have set him up. He just spends majority of the movie brooding and feeling depressed over the public turn it against them. Ben Affleck as Batman despite the criticism that he was getting before the films released end up being the biggest highlight of the movie. He comes out as dark and brooding but also extremely brutal same time well the idea of having a Batman not afraid to brand and even kill criminals. Batman's fighting is done very well Choreographed especially the warehouse scene towards the final act of the movie. When he's chasing down thugs in the Batmobile seeing what the cars capable it's similar to the Tumblr from the Christopher Nolan trilogy. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther is without a doubt the biggest fault of this movie he does not act anyway like the character he does not have his egomaniac persona, he does not have this devilish charm and all-around Genius intellect. Lex Luthor is the smartest man in the DC universe but he comes off more as a zany wacky cartoon mad scientist. It does not seem as if he would actually be a threat to either superman or even Batman. Superman's arch nemesis debut and he has no real reason in this movie to actually hate superman. Superman fight with zod has left Lex with contracts to rebuild every damage properly in Metropolis. The rest of the Characters are just tossed there and put to the side roles. Lois Lane doesn't really have much to contribute apart from a few talks with Clark. She does nothing important at all if you consider finding out Luther is the villain should be a shocker to anybody watching this movie. Gal Gadot as wonder woman could've been interesting. She does not contribute anything really important this movie outside of Bruce finding out that there are other metahumans in the world and that she's one of them until the final battle with doomsday she does not do anything worth noting in this movie at all. You don't know anything about her. Not until her solo movie which came out after this. Lastly the biggest thing to talk about in this movie is the death of Superman and overall it was handled absolutely poorly and horrendously the fact that the superman has no impact on this world at all you see nobody in this world defend him or see him as A victim in any of his actions. This movie does not have the impact that any adaptation from any of the cartoons in TV shows or even the comics. There's no huge funeral with people we care for from Superman life. No Jimmy Olsen,Lana Lang, Bibbo Bibbowski, Dan Turpin to be seen at all in the crowd there's no justice league Members at all here because The league doesn't exist yet so there's no epic shot of the league marching down with his coffin. All of this could've been saved for three more movies down the line."
" Eh
",0.0,-0.7548,2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,Personally I found this movie quite boring and crap and I thought Civil War was a far better movie
" Watch the director's cut
",-0.2732,0.9638,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"There were definitely some plot-holes, and the final fight felt a little generic to me. Despite all this, BvS is definitely worth watching for the character arcs, the acting, and the cinematography, along with a great score by Zimmer and XL (although MoS's score was better). Ben Affleck sold the hell out of Batman and Cavill was amazing as ever in his roll. Gal Gadot got her time to shine as WW too, and boy was she brilliant. Definitely worth watching her solo movie too.With all that said, if you do watch the movie, don't go in with MoS or Avengers-level expectations of punchy action all the time. This movie is about flashing out the characters, and it did a great job at that. And if you do watch, definitely go for the Ultimate Edition. It adds a lot of depth and narrative which was previously missing."
" Refreshing
",0.0,0.4077,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"When I first watched this film in IMAX, I must admit I was not entirely impressed following the sheer awesomeness we got in Man of Steel. A few weeks ago I borrowed the directors cut from a friend and this film quickly became one of my favourite comic book movies of all time. Seriously under appreciated."
" Badman v Superman, why is this so bad Dc?
",-0.6696,-0.7621,2021-03-14 00:00:00,4,I actually really like the Bad Man movies as well as the Super Man movies but this movie was just so bad. It is a boring movie. The plot? Maybe a good idea but it doesn't work? Acting? Was ok but not perfect.
" Ultimate Edition is still disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.406,2021-03-14 00:00:00,4,"In anticipation of Zack Snyder's Justice League, I decided to rewatch Zack's previous two DCEU entries. I watched BvS in theatres in 2016 and remember feeling immeasurable disappointment. Now that 5 years have passed and I have watched many movies, I was wondering if my opinions on this movie would change. Additionally, I would be would watching the Ultimate edition which contains 31 minutes of additional footage. This is my first time watching the Ultimate edition so it was also a sort of new experience in a way. ""It's been nearly two years since Superman's (Henry Cavill) colossal battle with Zod (Michael Shannon) devastated the city of Metropolis. The loss of life and collateral damage left many feeling angry and helpless, including crime-fighting billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck). Convinced that Superman is now a threat to humanity, Batman embarks on a personal vendetta to end his reign on Earth, while the conniving Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) launches his crusade against the Man of Steel"". So is this movie a misunderstood gem or still a massive disappointment?Firstly, Ben Affleck is still an excellent Batman. I find him incredibly charming as Bruce Wayne while also portraying the jaded and the rage-filled Batman perfectly. Gal Gadot is introduced as Wonder Woman in this movie and is honestly still one of the best parts. She is very elegant and mysterious as Diana but then an absolute badass as Wonder Woman. Jeremy Irons is snarky and wise as the beloved Alfred as well. Henry Cavill returns as Superman and Amy Adams returns as Lois Lane with both still doing a great job in their respective roles. There are some other supporting actors new and returning who all do fine jobs as well.The cinematography by Larry Fong is really good and visually there are still some great shots. Hans Zimmer returns to score but is now collaborating with Junkie XL and it is an absolute phenomenal score. The Batman theme is amazing, the Wonder Woman theme is exciting and the Lex Luthor theme is unsettling. There is more oomph in the score thanks to Junkie XL which makes the action scene feel more thrilling.On that note, the action scenes concerning Batman are exceptional. The Metropolis destruction but from Bruce Wayne perspective is one of the most exciting intros in a superhero movie ever. It also perfectly captures the destruction from a bystander view and also illustrates exactly why Batman hates Superman. The Batmobile chase sequence is also quite a stand-out with how awesome it is. Just seeing the Batmobile destroy everything in its path is fun to watch. The Batman warehouse fight scene is the best to have ever graced the screen. It is choreographed amazingly and shot in such a way that it is easy to see what is going on while still feeling every punch.However, the same can't be said with the Batman vs Superman fight. Rewatching it again makes me see how underwhelming this fight is. The first thing to note that is only one fight between these two characters in a 3-hour movie which already sucks but the fight itself is visually boring. It's choreographed in a way that feels like it is from a slapstick comedy. Superman launches him through some walls, Batman gases him and then punches him in the face for a bit, repeat and that's the fight. Superman acts dumb in the fight and Batman just moves slowly due to the armour which leads to a really silly fight to watch. I think people tear into it a lot but the fight resolution of Martha is still quite silly. I think the idea behind it is fine with Batman realizing Superman's humanity. It's just that the scene doesn't convey this very well and put too much emphasis on the ""Martha"" name instead of the human aspect. It's also executed very clunkily which leads to an ironically hilarious scene when it shouldn't be. The fight against Doomsday at the end is just a big CGI-fest against some dark grey looking thing at night. It's hideous to look at with its abundant of grey and black colours with overly flashy lights that just makes it seem dull.The story has 4 perspectives with the Batman one being the best. His hatred for Superman is understandable and trying to get the Kryptonite to fight him is the most easily enjoyable parts. On the other hand, Superman's perspective is so boring and forgettable. The people treating him like a hero or a god while some detesting him is fine. It's just he is so mopey in every scene which makes every scene involving him just not fun to watch. There is also a weird part in his arc where he goes into a snow mountain and hallucinates his dad which was just so dumb. I do find Superman dislike for Batman a mixed bag as he is criticizing him for his vigilantism and being above the law but that is exactly what Superman does too. The Ultimate edition adds more Clark Kent investigation which adds more to it and shows that he dislikes the brutality of his method and the fear he causes which is more understandable. Lois Lane is also another perspective with her trying to figure out who is producing this mysterious bullet. It's a very pointless perspective and quite a waste of time considering it amounts to something that the audience already knows, Lex Luthor was the one who did it! Lex is also the last perspective with him dealing with senators who obstruct him and him building a monster just because I guess? His perspective is fine for the plot but it's not enjoyable to watch because of the actor.Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is one of the worst casting choices I have ever seen. While every other actor feels grounded and serious, Jesse Eisenburg feels very cartoony and over the top. It's made worst as a majority of his lines are dumb. There are some great lines from Lex but they are poorly executed because of Jesse's terrible performance. His character's motivation is understandable but his whole plan is borderline ridiculous and convoluted. It makes genuinely no sense apart from the fact that the movie just needed a mastermind. The Granny's peach tea thing is oddly hilarious but a dumb moment too. There are also some random dream sequences in this movie that adds nothing to the main narrative. The noted Knightmare sequence just happens midway through the movie without any setup or any reference later. Likewise for the future flash sequence which you think Batman would make a note of later but doesn't. There is also the famous Wonder Woman checks her email sequence that is just so unnecessary. It baffles me that Zack didn't just have it at the end of the movie as these scenes are so distracting and unconnected to the main story.Overall, the Ultimate edition makes the plot feel more coherent but BvS is still a massive disappointment. There are some great moments but the writing is just so atrociously bad that it is very difficult for these moments to shine through. However, it is a unique vision and doesn't completely feel like most Superhero movies. I can see why people kept campaigning for Zack's version of Justice League because even if it is bad, it's going to be unique. In the end, it's not the worst Superhero movie as some, including me originally, would make it out to be but it's not a hidden masterpiece as some others would too."
" BvS Ultimate Edition review
",0.0,0.9268,2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Ultimate Edition reviewThis movie is a masterpiece. If one wants big flashy, funny heroes, all is good kinda marvel movie, this ain't it. In Marvel movies heroes face annihilation and they say jokes and funny stuff in those moments. It's not real. It's a superhero film.This is a superhero movie that raises so many philosophical questions and it's real, how things can be real in world with superheroes. These superheroes are people with desires, fears, questions, not sure if what they are doing is good, you know like people question themselves. This is a movie about the world we live in, how we deal with God. I mean it's brilliant. But only the Ultimate Edition. What we got in theaters is junk."

" Just awful
",-0.4588,-0.996,2021-03-09 00:00:00,3,"Even the extended cut. Just more to dislike. And soon will be another ultra extended version...UGH.
It should have had many characters re-cast (and I don't mean Ben Affleck either, he is ok. Not the best, but still ok) First that HAS to go is Jesse Eisenberg. He is the worst. Annoying and when he opens his mouth it is like nails on a chalkboard. Terrible actor, and absolutely not suited for the part. He is just a babbling idiot. Does not come across as a evil science genius. Couldn't tie hiis shoe laces. Blunder Woman is also just wrong. Whatever her name is, also a bad actress. Never liked Amy Adams either.
The story is also just sooo wrong. BvS - why? The plot leading up to the fight is really stretching it and not believable. Makes the whole thing just pessimistic and gloomy. Really depressing. I do not want to watch a movie that makes me depressed.
I still give it a 3 for most of the rest of the cast."

I recently watched the Ultimate edition of this movie and oh my god I love it. It explains all the plot holes and the inconsistencies, and I have also gone to love Zacks vision and his story. The few criticisms I have are that Diana opening the file of the Meta-Humans should be a post-credit scene at the very least and the knightmare scene should be explained a bit more"

Where this film fails is a plot with far too many convenient coincidences, where it succeed is a couple of well framed shots. Whilst Zack Snyder can shoot a film to look cool he really doesn't tell a story worth watching here.
Previous superhero films have been enjoyed by having a signature style, being grounded in reality or building back stories that allow you to connect with the characters, this film has none of the above.
It relies on the names and reputations of other versions of these characters and hopes by shoving them together that you'll be happy, you won't be."

" Tedious....
",0.0,-0.8682,2021-03-06 00:00:00,3,"This is a review for the Ultimate edition. I have not seen the Theatrical version.This film should be a lesson during film school on editing; It is far too long with too many irrelevent, overlong and dragging scenes that turned what might have been a good movie into a boring overlong mess.For example, when Superman dies you know its the end of the film. But there is still another 30mins to go of irrelevent tediousness like a fully shown funeral, then people talking, then more people talking and other people talking.Everything there should have been cut completely. Then you have the frequent Bruce Wayne dream sequences where often you don't know what you are seeing is really happening or another dream. They were a waste of time and should have been cut. What purpose did they serve in forwarding the plot?Then you have the incredibly overlong task of simply bringing in a rock of kyptonite into America from India. Why was any of this needed for the plot? What did it serve to the story where it could have just been brought in and saved 30mins of irrelevent and boring story.Bruce Waynes parents being killed. Does anyone not know this backstory? The film clearly makes the assumption you already knew the Batman origins story so why even show this entire sequence, and repeat it multiple times but to drag down the runtime?In the 80s and 90s film makers had a goal to make a film enjoyable instead of just making it an overlong borefest. Thus they almost never went over 2hrs and usually kept the film to the golden 1hr 45minuutes and cut their films down for pace. In the 2010 and 2020s we have lost this and film makers just allow overlong pretentious borefests."
" Did i watch something different
",0.0,0.8151,2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I was told and read about how awful this movie was and i just don't get it, what did everyone else watch ? this was by far the best CBM ever made. firstly, the score was out of this world ! lex and wonder woman's soundtracks were amazing. i loved the realism and the take on how people would really react if there was a superman; henry is the perfect superman. he played the confused conflicted god like role to perfection especially with his facial expressions. affleck as an older batman losing his way was the best batman portrayal we'll probably ever see, we're spoon fed through dialogue (by alfred) just how much he is currently changing and becoming hateful, he's slowly becoming the very thing that created him. lex was also a nice fresh take, he hates superman because he's viewed as a god and lex hates/blames god for never saving him from his abusive father; lex also states his motives throughout the movie by saying stuff like ""you cannot be all powerful and be all good."" the ""martha"" scene was also done very well, bruce realizing he's become superman's joe chill (guy who killed batman's parents) was done beautifully. i can see how people wouldn't like this movie but to say it's awful or garbage is ridiculous, to quote this masterpiece one more time.....""people hate what they don't understand"""

I watched it in 2016 and really liked it, but after watching extended cut you can understand and accept what's going on the screen. Just don't pay so much attention on ""Martha"" script. Critics didn't like it because of darkness, seriousness, but this is DC where everything is much more tragic and darker than in other comics. In this film you can see the most iconic Superman ever by Henry Cavill, and brutal Batman by Affleck who is great in his role. Enjoy this film and get ready for #SnyderCut.

Felt that Batman was darker than usual (didn't think he killed people but a does a few times in this movie). Over all it's a great super hero movie.Only complain is I felt like Jesse Eisenberg really tried to be a Heath Ledger Joker in his way of showing Lex Luther. Long hair, erratic movements, playful yet crazy manner, and just the way he spoke his lines really made me feel like he was trying to channel Heath in his portrayal. Other than that I enjoyed the film a lot."
" Why I love Batman v Superman (extended cut)
",0.6369,0.9987,2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Spoiler! I watched the film for the 20th time or so today, 02/28/21 and I still find the film awesome, BUT only in the ultimate edition. I don't know what Warner was thinking when they released the theatrical version. I mean the whole plot about the explosion in the capitol and why superman couldn't see the bomb, the explanation would simply be left out so that the viewers no longer see what happened in the first place, and so on. The only thing that bothers me is the title itself that the film is called Batman v Superman. Sure they fight against each other, but that's just one of the many acts in the film. That's why I no longer pay any attention to the title. I mean you could call the film ""Bring god down"" or something. But then you would probably think it was a roland emmerich film or something.
Zack Snyder is generally a matter of taste, I personally love Zack Snyder's visual style. Maybe I'm so blinded by his style that I don't care about the story or something.Although I don't really see it that way. I like that one asks the question whether we need these ""heroes"" at all and whether we can trust them. And that should also distinguish the DCEU from the MCU. I also think that the first 20 minutes seem a little unstructured, but that goes away again during the course of the film. Sure Batman, Superman, Lois, Alfred etc. are great. I also loved Lex Luthor, I really liked this interpretation of Eisenberg's. That's just that point again that Zack Snyder dares to do many new things. Doomsday looked well ... OK. When the spines come out of his body, in my opinion, he looks better again, because then his skin has more structure. When it has no spines, its skin looks so smooth, too smooth. Otherwise the effects are good. I also noticed that some effects look like comics. For example, if Batman comes through the floor fighting in the warehouse then the hole in the floor looks like drawn. It doesn't look really realistic but it doesn't look like a real thing. It is the same with the ship dss supermam in a scene. The soundtrack is the abdolute oberhammer, not such a weak sülze as with a thousand other films and like with Justice League (then danny elfman probably had no idea what to do), no here there is an epic, LOUD soundtrack that is also catchy with mecaused. The best tracks in my opinion are:
-Beautiful lie
-Figjt Night
-the red caprs are coming
-they were here (or something)
Just crazy. Sound is great and picture is great.CONCLUSION:
Batmans v Superman: Dawn of Justice (UE) is an absolute top film for me because Ben Affleck is my favorite interpretation of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and other characters are great. The film tells a darker, more realistic, interesting story and I love Snyder's visual style. Picture, sound, effects and music are awesome. And that's why Batman v Superman is one of my all-time favorite films."

When I say bloated, I mean that this is a sequel to Man of Steel (2013), a Batman origin story film, and a Justice League setup. I'm really happy with the introduction of Gal Gadot and her scenes were amazingly done, but I could have done without the email thread Justice League setup. Instead of getting me excited I experienced more of an eye roll as I just wanted to continue with the main story. Lex Luthor being casted by Jesse Eisenberg was an intestine choice, where I would have much preferred Kevin Spacey from Superman Returns, but there is something intimidating about a character who seems weak and unstable, but proves to be malicious and dangerous. Cinematography, fight choreography, CGI and special effects, SCORE, pacing and most of the writing is on point. The Ultimate Edition is the way to go, more context, my characters building scenes and more heartfelt moments. I will say the title is misleading.

The script is complicated and fails to do anyone any justice. The actors do their part but within closeups. The action is passable, the score is good, a few scenes are good but the narrative barely earns the emotions from our side, thus leaving BVS heartless.

" Epic Fantasy Saga chapter 2
",0.0,0.9958,2021-02-15 00:00:00,9,"In Man of Steel we were introduced to a world very much like our own in a universe that is inhabited by this High Fantasy Heavy Metal Krypton and showed us the day a world like ours is introduced to alien beings with god like powers and technology that is devastating. Batman V Superman is a film of consequences and deals with the full spectrum of ramifications from that film. Batman V Superman deals with how societies, governments and people react to the emergence of alien life.Zack Snyder has taken the really well built world of Man of Steel and now expands the mythology in a really effective well utilising DC Comics mythology in brand new ways In this world which is actually quite believable. Lex Luthor sees Superman's morality as a threat, Batman has been humbled by Superman's sheer power which has made him fearful of this new world, governments are scared of his sovereignty and the people reach out for this saviour. Snyder built a world very much like ours in the first film and it's reacting to Superman in a very believable way.Zack Snyder is a master of visual medium and really delivers on incredibly beautiful sequences that ground and heighten this world.The story utilises several different investigations that lead the characters to one inescapable clash between two heroes that have been outplayed by the mechanisations of Lex but the clash ultimately ends with one character seeing the humanity in the other though a very simple similarity in their lives. The last act does sever much to place this film in the saga that is unfolding which is the ultimate battle that hopefully will carry on into Zack Snyder's Justice League.It's interesting that DC was going to take a very different approach to its cinematic universe than marvel by building a Saga more along to Lord of the Rings that May culminate in Zack Snyder's Justice League. It makes the Snyderverse and Epic High Fantasy Saga that is incredibly interesting.The acting in this is fantastic with every actor on the top of their game. Affleck and Cavil really shown two fantastic heroes and Gadot lays the seeds for her big reveal moment so well. Eisenberg is very cartoony and can come off over the top but with cleaver moments for the character this is eased out and we get some truly wicked Lex Luthor moments.Batman V Superman is a film with plenty of layers and moments to truly please whilst continuing the Saga from Man Of Steel and setting up the next iteration in the Saga. A Epic ride that's very enjoyable."

" Ultimate Edition
",0.0,-0.992,2021-02-13 00:00:00,5,"Ultimately it was 30 additional minutes of garbage and a waste of time.
As far as DC Thumbs up to Richard Donner Superman 1978
Thumbs up to Christopher Nolan on the Batman Trilogy
Thumbs up to Patty Jenkins on Wonder Woman (2017)
I'll even give a nod to James Wan's Aquaman (2018) though more for kids.
Mr. Snyder....you're not Loeb, or Paul Dini or even Frank Miller in your comic writing you're worse than Grant Morrison....adding over an hour to a horrid CGI Justice League in color or Black and white will stink just as badly as the original, as badly as Man of Steal, and as badly as this trash I'm reviewing now.
You can't write a comic or make a hyped up film that doesn't stink. You have three stinkers (4 if you count the extra 30 minutes of this garbage) So stop blaming Warner Bros. for your garbage.
Fans should be blaming DC for their writing teams total lack of continuity and 5 million different writers, and choosing Zack Snyder...but he makes the studio money so they don't care...Proof in Batman 1989-1997 1 mediocre 1 great for kids, and 2 that should have been shelved.
The Batman Trilogy is the Gold Standard, so your supposed vision of Justice Leage will not be Sergio Leone's European release of ""Once Upon a Time in America"". And the money has been flushed already on ""The Batman"" which I assume will be another loud irritating CGI fest.
Ultimately as a fan regardless of age, you blame DC52, and the DC reboot. They're simply put not Marvel...and haven't been since 1967.
The only time cross over heroes work successfully for DC are in their Lego Films. Try to make a descent solo movie first before giving me a 100th version of the DC universe.
They killed Mad Magazine, they killed Archie Comics, hell they killed Superman long ago and their TV ""Arrowverse"" after a season or two they manage to kill as well.
I think 3 stars is generous....in reality the one that's a half hour less was a minus one."

Hats off to Zack Snyder."

But upon seeing the theatrical version I was disappointed. It had the looks of a great superhero movie but real substance was nowhere to be found. There wasn't enough back story for casual fans to understand what was going on, so not a lot of people could really enjoy it. But luckily they released the extended version. While it makes the movie longer, it explains so much and helps keep fans who aren't that familiar with the DC universe keep up with the flow of the movie. With the release of the extended version hopefully people will give the movie another shot. As a DC fan I'm biased but I promise it is better than theatrical version."

The trailers were misleading, the religious metaphors are very on the nose and not deep at all and Lex Luthor, Batman and Superman don't act like their comic counterparts at all, not that it is a bad thing in itself, but Zack Snyder ruined those three characters with confuse and wannabe-deep writingThe actual fight between Batman and Superman, while good, was solved in the most ""what the hell did I just watch?"" way. People trying to pretend that ""Save Martha"" was a good and philosophically deep resolution to the conflict (to the point Batman turned friends with Superman) is laughableThe third act of the movie is very convoluted and even if the theatrical cut has 3 hours of movie, the end still felt rushed and the death of Superman didn't have any emotional impact at all.But the action sequences that do not involve apocalypse are very good and the character of Wonder Woman is a plus, too."

I can say with absolute confidence that this film will be talked about and debated for many more years to come!

" BvS Ultimate Edition Is The Greatest Superhero Film
",0.6369,0.9705,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"NOTE - This review is based on the Ultimate Edition as that version representative of the filmmaker's true vision and NOT the theatrical.Continuing the high bar set by the masterpiece that is Man of Steel, Zack Snyder along with writers David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio further explore the question of ""What if Superman were real?"" and how a world like ours, so politicized and xenophobic will view him. The introduction of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Lex Luthor into the story and their roles were fantastic. Their roles of power juxtaposed but when given further thought, they aren't that dissimilar. The film's exploration of the theme of power, loss, falling, and redemption is expertly crafted. It doesn't hurt that long time collaborator cinematographer Larry Fong makes the film utterly gorgeous in every frame. The lighting choices, the texture of the film grain elevates the film to a degree that it transcends its 'comic book status'. No, this is a film worthy of study and dissection by film students for years to come. I enjoyed this film immensely and it is my all-time favs. It just happens to have Batman AND Superman in it."
" This film was a little too timely for 2016
",0.0,-0.315,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"""The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world.""DC's two biggest heroes face off, but this film is closer to a political thriller than a punch-fest. If you go in expecting the latter, you'll probably be bored to tears. Instead, we have the philosophies of Batman and Superman face off while Lex Luthor plays puppet-master in the background. Thinking back, the evil billionaire manipulating the media against an illegal immigrant feels incredibly timely in retrospect. And given the cultural division of its home market, should it be any wonder that it is a figure of controversy?The casting for this film is perfect and has been one of its greatest gifts to the DCEU. Henry Cavill *is* this generation's Superman. Ben Affleck delivers both the suave yet broken Bruce Wayne and a physically intimidating Caped Crusader. This is someone I believe can charm women and put fear in criminals. His introduction is that of a horror film, signalling that he is not the hero. However his encounter with Superman leaves him reborn, able to walk back the path to the light and justice that years of fruitless work have let him stray from.Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the true hero of this film. She follows the thread of the bullet she retained by chance in Lex Luthor's trap (probably not the first, but the first successful) for Superman with tenacity that reminds us of why she represents the best of humanity. And her intervention is his downfall. And Adam's carries this vital energy that conveys how smart and driven Lois is while not sacrificing her tender and intimate relationship with Clark. Gal's entrance as Wonder Woman is incredibly memorable (and that smile) and it is a shame this was spoiled in the trailers. Her Diana is elegant and deadly.The most controversial casting is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Chris Terrio's dialogue and the word play Lex uses to project dominance are a gift and Eisenberg delivers every line -- selling a terrible anger centered in the character even as Lex plays at being harmless and builds his alibi of a mental breakdown in case things go wrong. There are so many quotable lines, but the entire rooftop scene confrontation with Superman gives me chills even on re-watch. I cannot help but resonate with every rage-filled word as he lays out his grievances based on his projection onto Clark. An mirror of Bruce Wayne's arc, Lex confronts Superman and finds his worst nature rather than his best, made more terrible by him *knowing* and taking advantage of the fact that Clark is just a man. His manipulations in the background are three steps ahead of everyone (except Lois Lane) making every action into a Xanatos gambit and I came to really appreciate this incarnation of my all-time favorite villain.Cameos from characters from Man of Steel make the entire universe feel connected and appropriate in dealing with the consequences of the destruction wrought by humanity's first contact with another advanced civilization.Unfortunately, the theatrical cut is weakened by a significant missing portion of footage and almost feels like the viewer should have done the background readings in advance. The Ultimate Edition fills in many of the connective gaps rather than force viewers to infer them. The film itself improves on rewatch (I only truly fell in love with it after seeing it multiple times). Zack Snyder often excels at background visual detail that is missed on first viewing and the Ultimate Edition only enhances that feeling.Visuals, as expected from Zack Snyder, are iconic and the action scenes couldn't be better. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL also outdo themselves with the score.Overall, this is the movie I always wanted to see with these characters. Unlike many CBMs, this isn't an action-comedy but a revenge tragedy given a blockbuster budget. Dark, brooding, and almost religious in tone, this take on our modern myths requires you to buy that the footsteps of the gods can shake this earth as a serious concept. But it rewards the viewer who is willing to put that effort in.TLDR Summary: I liked it."

Batman has been at it for some time and isn't the Batman we know anymore; whereas Superman isn't the Superman we know yet.Everyone was on their A-game here, especially Affleck, who stole the show from the first scene he was in, until the end. I thought he was heavily miscast but he proved me wrong.Amy Adams is great but her character isn't the brightest at one particular point in the film. Gal Gadot... was just amazing.Great movie, great characters, great story although the villain's plot can get too convoluted and not delivered in the best way especially in the theatrical version.I'd tell everyone who hated on this film, to give the extended cut a try; it'll help you fill in the gaps and maybe appreciate it a little more.I waited so long to review this in case my adoration for it dwindled with time.

Snyder managed to blow DC fans minds with his movie recipe which consists of top comics loved by fans and modern struggle. In my point of view, non-comic book fans are blamed for disliking it, but they're blamed for only 2 things. 1, it's a sin comparing DC with Marvel, trust me it is. At all scales, Marvel movies (to me) are about punch and joke then punch and joke. No depth, probably the same frame for every superhero origin. So, don't compare for your own self respect. And 2, the Martha scene. I can't get why is that even funny? A broken Batman fueled by Robin's death and Luthor's letters realising that he's killing an alien who lived a human in the same world and all what he wanted is his mother to be saved. The movie is buffed with mind games by Snyder, leaving so many clues on the movie's ground. 2 clues for at least 2 Green Lanterns, that random John Stewart scene, and the last unusual plane flight in the ceremony of Superman. Jason Todd the dead Robin .. Bruce: ""How many good guys are left, how many stayed that way?"". FLASHPOINT PARADOX CLUE. DARKSIED OMEGA SIGNAL AND PARADEMONS.

This film has aged better than any other Marvel movies. Everyone loved Civil War compared to this but who talks about that movie now?

Anyway, so yesterday I bought and watched the 'Ultimate Cut', which has about 1+ hour runtime more than the 'theatrical cut', and it was MUCH MUCH better! It adds a lot more to Clark's and Bruce's character arcs and makes their motives way more clear.

",0.0,0.5103,2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Batman vs Superman is a very muddled film, the plot is all over the place and there's no good villain or powerful adversary for them to fight until the end. I do not like Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor nor do I think much for Ben Affleck as batman, although he's alright.The storyline is a mess. There's absolutely no way Batman and Superman would fight and it feels like Zack Snyder just watched the Dark Knight and wanted to copy it. Christian Bale's Batman works with only a bit of humour, this doesn't and is a drag.However, there are a few positives. The special effects are amazing and some of the fight sequences well choregraphed and it was great to see Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman for the first time. But overall there's not enough action or good storytelling to justify the length of the film.3/10: Boring, a big budget and special effects can't save this"
" This movie started all of the problems
",-0.4019,0.9888,2020-12-30 00:00:00,5,"Honestly, I NEVER wanted this DCEU thing to happen. As soon as BATMAN V SUPERMAN:DAWN OF JUSTICE was announced, I hated the idea of combining the universes of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman along with several other heroes that were introduced later in Justice League. Even though Man of Steel wasn't a masterpiece, it was still a good and interesting film with a lot of great fight scenes, strong performances, and a smashing ending. After I saw it I was looking forward to continuing the story of Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane in a sequel, but not THIS sequel. I wanted to see Man of Steel 2, not Man of Steel versus The Dark Knight with a side of Amazon Lady. By merging all these universes, this film single-handedly created a ton of plot holes. To quote Joker from TDK...and...here...we...go!So all of a sudden, Gotham City is just across the river from Metropolis? This weird, Gothic town with strange and macabre villains and a guy wearing a bat suit all of a sudden exists in the Man of Steel universe and across from a normal city with normal people? Where was the immortal and powerful Wonder Woman during the events of Man of Steel? Supes really could have used her help to fight Zod and his minions. She literally can't be killed and has all these powerful weapons (lasso of truth, gold armor) and abilities (flying, invisibility) at her disposal and has defeated literal gods, as we keep finding out in all these later films whose timeline is before the current ones. Speaking of which, even more so than Man of Steel, the Wonder Woman 2017 movie turned out to be superb and universally proclaimed as the best of all the DCEU movies, another indicator that they should have kept these superheroes separate.As with many people, I most definitely agree that the best part of BvS is Ben Affleck's take on Bruce Wayne/Batman, plus Jeremy Irons makes for a great Alfred, which again is yet another reason why Affleck should have gotten his own dedicated Batman movie, not relegated to sharing the screen with other superheroes. In particular, this movie pretty much ruined Henry Cavill's Superman and turned his and Amy Adams' Lois Lane into sideshow acts when they should have been the main story of their own movie. Cavill and Adams seemed so distracted and bored in this movie compared to Man of Steel. Gal Gadot was fine as Diana/Wonder Woman, but it was weird seeing her show up in this movie first, only to get her dedicated Wonder Woman film 2 years later. It unnecessarily complicates the timeline and universes.If Man of Steel was serious, then BvS was super serious, mired in politics and melodrama with this idea that Superman is like a god who could be a dangerous threat to the world. This is the SAME man who just saved the world from Zod and his Kryptonian goons in Man of Steel. Superman protected innocent people and saved the Earth from certain destruction asking for nothing in return. But instead of a Man of Steel 2 that builds on this theme and getting a film reminiscent of the 1978 classic Superman, we get this languorous, overlong, pretentious mess that is drab and dark and depressing. Then even after this failure of a movie, Hollywood doubles down and does a Justice League film a few years later with twice the superheroes in BvS and that gets even worse reception. And now it's even affecting the standalones as the recent Wonder Woman 1984 has bombed. These DCEU movies are just getting worse and worse and I think it all started with the decision to merge the superheroes into one universe and BvS sadly started the trend."

" A Mess, but a Respectable One from Zack Snyder
",0.4767,0.9994,2020-12-28 00:00:00,6,"NOTE: Review of the Ultimate Cut.Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice takes place after the events of Man of Steel. Bruce Wayne is investigating more about Superman after an incident that makes people question whether they are safe with his power. Clark Kent also wants to expose Batman's tactics with the Daily Planet. They are trying to show how the other is dangerous for humanity. Lex Luthor wants to get the two to fight so he can destroy Superman. Luthor also wants to get access to kryptonite as a way to take Superman down.There is a lot that happens in Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The story is packed with many details. There is Lex trying to gain access to Kryptonite, there is Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne trying to expose each other, there is the idea of whether Superman is a god or not, there is the bat branding and much more. There is a lot to unpack here and while there are plenty of great ideas in this movie, the story does not utilize most of them well. The idea of Superman being a god is kind of tapped on. It is hinted, but the movie does not go far enough with it. There could also be a scene where someone compares the actions of Superman to the actions of Batman. They are both responsible for the deaths of people in rather brutal ways. The best scenes are with Kent and Wayne going at it by talking about how their cities would be less dangerous without the other. That was a great scene filled with tension. Also, I think the bat branding is explored pretty well, better than I remember. This part always haunted me as an adolescent.The detective work makes for the best scenes because not just building tension, but these scenes also question whether superheroes are morally okay. Do they cause too much damage? Are they the reasons why there are so many casualties? When the movie works, it is really interesting and intense. When it does not work, it is so cringeworthy. There is two dream sequences that completely break the pace of the film. They never come into play later in the story. There is also a scene where Diana looks at footage of Cyborg, The Flash and Aquaman. They needed the Wonder Woman content, but adding the other three members? That seemed like the most annoying setup to Justice League. The Martha scene still drives me crazy. The story had some good moments and some bad moments. It was not boring, but it had some very frustrating moments.As for the characters, they are also a mixed bag. Henry Cavil as Superman is great once again, but it feels like his character learned little from the last film. He goes in on Batman instead of just pinning him down and talking to him in the big fight. Here, he is given more motivation to go after Batman than I remember. He knows that Batman is challenging him, so he is trying to keep him in his place. Batman is played by Ben Affleck. He is great in the role and he is so much more capable than I gave him credit for before seeing the movie. His voice fits Batman perfectly and he makes for a charismatic Bruce Wayne. Also, I love Jeremy Irons as Alfred. These two are wonderful and they have tight chemistry.As for Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor... oh boy. Jesse Eisenberg is a talented actor. He has been in The Social Network, American Ultra, Zombieland and a few other films. He is a good actor, but he completely miscast. He acts more like the Joker than Lex Luthor with the way he acts. Every line that comes out of his mouth is so sporadic, he has the creepy laughs and nothing about him even resembled Lex. I know that this is supposed to be a younger version of the character, but nothing about this character worked. His plan was bad, he was more annoying than sinister and Eisenberg felt wrong for the role. Doomsday is such an odd villain choice. Why couldn't this just be a big match between Batman and Superman with the last action scene being the warehouse scene? Doomsday felt so tapped on. He could have easily have been the Justice League villain. However, the climactic battle with Doomsday is enjoyable, but I wish it was better implemented.As for the rest of the characters, Lois Lane is a bigger damsel in distress here than in Man of Steel, Perry White is even less likable than before, June Finch is a rather flat character, and Wonder Woman is shoved in the story. Having Batman in the follow-up to Man of Steel is already a stretch. Adding Wonder Woman just makes the story more convoluted. I don't think she added anything to the movie except some awesome moments in the climax. Gal Gadot is not as strong here as she is in her other appearances, but she was just warming up here. She gets stronger each movie. The cast is good, but most of the supporting characters fall flat.The action scenes are mostly great. There is an awesome chase scene with the Batmobile. The climax with Doomsday is throughly entertaining even though Doomsday was wrong for this movie. It is visually stunning and it utilizes the powers of all three heroes. Then there is the warehouse. That is without the best action scene in the entire DCEU and one of my favorite action scenes overall. Batman is just destroying thugs using his gadgets and his combat skills. This scene is always cathartic. It feels like watching a Batman Arkham City fight come to life on the big screen. We need more Batman sequences like this. There is one action scene that is incredibly underwhelming... the fight between Batman and Superman. I was disappointed by it when I first saw it back in 2016 and it is still an utter letdown. The fight only lasts around 5-6 minutes after about a two-hour buildup and it is nowhere as exciting as it sounds. It is a blowout in Batman's favor, the hits are not that impactful and the setup for it is quite poor. I wish Lex was not even a big part of the film and two superheroes fought on their own. There are so many ways they could have made this the coolest fight in cinematic history and they dropped the ball. Honestly, the fight between Superman and General Zod in Man of Steel was better than the fight between Batman and Superman. Overall, the action is great, but the big fight scene was such a misfire.If there is one thing that I can definitely praise Batman v. Superman for, it is for the phenomenal technical qualities. This movie has some of the best cinematography I have scene in a film period. These shots are gorgeous. Even simple shots are made to look as professional as possible. Zack Snyder knows how to make a movie look stunning. The visual effects for the action all look great except for Doomsday who looks like a PS3 creature. Otherwise, the movie looks amazing. The color scheme is haunting and adds to the grim tone of the film. The soundtrack is composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. This movie has a terrific musical score. It is haunting and it has great remixes of the superheroes themes. It gives the sense of urgency that the movie builds. Technical aspects of a movie are important because they bring the movie to life if they are done well, even if the script is not that good. This movie nails all of the technical aspects.One thing that I said in my original review for this film is that it was too grim. I take that back. I love the tone this movie has. It is so fresh from the humorous and silly comic book movies that keep coming out. Also, it works because this is not a film about the two working together. It is about how they are trying expose one another for how dangerous they are to their respective communities. One thing the movie is about is that it challenges the idea of these heroes being good for the world and whether they should have a say in who lives and who dies. There is plenty of political intrigue in the film and it is played straight. That is why despite all of the glaring issues this film has, I have a lot respect for it nowadays. Even when it does not always work, I can tell that Zack Snyder and the writers are trying to create something truly unique.A lot of my opinions from my viewing of the theatrical film remain in the Ultimate Cut, but I do appreciate Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice more than I did back in 2016. It is a mess, but it is interesting and rarely boring despite the three-hour runtime. It is a gorgeous comic book movie that has a dark side to it. I'm glad that I got to revisit this movie, but it will probably be the last time I watch it."

" Dear Snyder Fans: Just because someone doesn't understands you, doesnt mean you're smart, it also can mean you're even dumber
",-0.2865,-0.8926,2020-12-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie is not for ""Smart People"" and it's NOT for the fans, the studio just want to make money, they don't think about the fans and how they will love this film, It's like ""LOOK, BATMAN IS FIGHTING AGAINST SUPERMAN, AND THERE IS MARK ZUCKERBERG, EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE IS IN THIS MOVIE, HAHA, now give us your money"", sad but true. Batman V Superman it's saturated of bad film editing, a poorly made attempt to establish the foundations of its next 6 films (I don't know if there are more, I do not know if they are less, the truth does not matter) and it's horrible that the combination of the structure and film editing gave us 2 minutes of each scene, (2 minutes of Batfleck, the 2 minutes of Superman, then 2 minutes of Jesse Eisenberg, then 2 minutes of Lois Lane, then antother 2 minutes of Batman) God, a movie doesn't work like that. Well, it has good topics like the perseption of the goverment against Superman or Batman's perception of the world after Robin's death, but they are so badly executed and so bad directed that the movie gets boring. The biblical and mythological references doesn't make the movie the movie smart and deep, actually, it make the film look ultra pretencious and over saturated. But the worst thing about this movie is the fanbase that has raised."
" I hope Colbert will be proud of this one.
",0.7184,0.9921,2020-12-20 00:00:00,4,"Wow, This is exactly what we needed for our superhero films! A pretentious, bloated mess of a film that I need to watch the Director's Cut to understand what's going on during the whole thing. It's not like I wanted a coherent, well paced superhero film with some thoughtful commentary put in, but I'll certainly pretend that it's a masterpiece of film, put alongside such classics as Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Vertigo.Snyder's grip on the characters are also phenomenal! He makes Superman into an angsty sourpuss who seems burdened by his mission rather than the compassionate humanist that we've come to know, Lex Luthor into an angsty, narcissistic creep, and Batman into an unhinged sociopath who's dropping people like The Punisher, but it's all a part of his arc! It's not like his arc is vaguely defined asides from him fearing about what Superman could do and a couple of scenes of him brooding at his parents' grave stones. It's just cinematic visual language for you dumb MCU fanboys to think about. It's not like Snyder's overtly trying to be deep and complex and attempting to overcompensate for it by having his characters be obsessed with being 'badass' and awesome, while also being so brooding and deep to act like the film is saying something profound.Changes can be good of course, but it's certainly not good if the changes are made in a way where it feels natural to who these characters that we love are. It only matters if someone decides to completely and cynically try to tear down a character in order to make some grand artistic statement, while his grasp on the term might be so limited that it makes The Wachowskis and Neil Blomkemp seem subtle. And James Gunn and Christopher Nolan said that he was good, so why should I question that? It's not like the appeal to authority argument is a fallacy and that even well known figures can be wrong about something, even if I like them.It was also so mature and dark in its approach, that's always a good sign when it comes to films. Surely there aren't any films that haven't tried to be dark and mature that come off as silly and overtly grim dark (cough cough Hellboy (2019) cough cough). This film is entirely different, it's a pretty looking film that half assedly trying to act like it's high art. It's definitely not like Snyder's been shown up by the MCU on several occasions like with Captain America: The Winter Soldier or any of the other films that The Russo Brothers have put out. Bah! Those are just dumb, predictable, jokey action flicks, of course they can't say anything that's profound or meaningful just because the characters crack wise every once in a while and aren't afraid to be fun.Perhaps there were the good scenes in this movie, like how the action scenes were well helmed and fun to watch, or Ben Affleck's take on Batman when he wasn't being such a badass sociopath, or great cinematography since Zack Snyder has always been a great visual director, or some interesting ideas thrown in to make this film seem meaningful, but they were made so much better by awkward pacing, pretentious commentary, and peerless direction from the one Zack Snyder, who's like if Stanley Kubrick and Terry Gilliam bumped ugly and made this gift from the Gods themselves. I've certainly sat through enough dumb MCU jokefests that can be surprisingly deft and thoughtful when given to the right director, but this film made that wait so much more fruitful.And man, that Martha scene, it was SO powerful. It was so misunderstood by those MCU fanboys and it wasn't like that scene was completely pointless because Batman is going around murdering people like Frank Castle and he's already become the thing that he's spent his entire career fighting against. But Batman's been killing people since his beginning as a character, it's not like he was originally envisioned as a knock off of The Shadow and the editors made Bill Finger and Bob Kane give Batman a no killing rule to try and differentiate him from The Shadow, as well as to make a character who kids could identify with and root for. It really shows that Zack Snyder knows what he's doing with these characters.I can't wait to see those MCU fanboys in the comments section, saying how this masterpiece is such a pretentious, overbloated mess, but I know better. This film is one of the greatest superhero films of all time, even if it's been utterly outdone time and time again. I can't wait to see Snyder continually abuse these characters that I love in order for him to make some half baked attempt to be 'deep' and 'meaningful.'"

" Billionaires Fight Illegal Aliens Jesus and Amazon
",-0.6705,-0.9412,2020-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Contrary to popular critical opinion, perhaps, I think ""Man of Steel"" (2013) did well to establish Superman as the antithesis of Batman. The Metropolis Marvel a refugee and migrant ""Dreamer"" embarking on a career in journalism--y'know, when not doing his caped messiah thing. And the Gotham Bat a plutocratic billionaire who beats poors and brands them in the cover of night with the zeal he might otherwise market the WayneCorp brand during the day. In the aftermath of DC's intergalactic 9/11 brought on by Kal-El's inadvertent chain migration, Bruce Wayne and another billionaire, Lex Luthor, take turns placing the blame for the atrocity on this hardworking immigrant Sun-god raised in Kansas and christened Clark Kent. (Note that Batty doesn't dare brand one of his own.) Reactionary, entitled titans of industry that they are, when not competing for finite resources (oil, vibranium, kryptonite, whatever), they try to extrajudicially murder the one guy who can get in the way of their making a buck. They even adopt the Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive strikes, and Wayne tries to use ""fuzzy math"" to prove his Iraq War theorem on Superman: ""...if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty, and we have to destroy him."" All the while, they're unaware that another illegal migrant, an Amazon, has been in their midst for the past century. Classic battle of nativism versus diversity, corporations and the working class, money against gods.Intriguing class-warfare scenario though it is from corporate overlords Time Warner (now under the domain of former-trust-but-totally-not-one-now multinational conglomerate holding company AT&T), with the inevitable olive branch of billionaire working with poors to conquer other billionaire (i.e. buy tickets and streaming subscriptions for DCEU movies, not Disney MCU ones)--down with the duopoly; long live the monopoly--""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" does its utmost to muck all of that up. As LexCorp CEO, Jesse Eisenberg seems to think he's doing a sequel to ""The Social Network"" (2010). A Democratic senator from Kentucky is so 1990s. While the meta-human thesis kind of works as analogous to home-grown terrorists, all of it and that dream of Wayne's is needless franchise-building filler. (Will have to see the Zack Snyder cut of ""Justice League"" (2017) to see if any of it ever even makes sense.)Meanwhile, as evidenced by the ""Ultimate Edition"" cut of this burger, executives saw fit to have Snyder cut for theatrical release some of the junk about the poors instead. Scenes of Lois Lane and Kent working as actual reporters: cut. Naming poor photographer Jimmy Olson: cut. More screen time for the Nairobi woman: cut. Another female character: cut. Making sense of how Superman could be framed for shooting people--including by torching them afterwards, which, yeah, because why would Superman use guns instead of laser eyes: cut. To be fair, though, the Snyder cut has the same major problems as the theatrical version, but with a more-bloated runtime. There's more lousy franchise building; too much of troll from ""The Hobbit"" trilogy meets Ninja Turtle meets Abomination from ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008), the Frankenstein kaiju ""Doomsday;"" there's still those awful sky beams and energy blasts we must endure in every other superhero flick; too much Eisenberg; too many stupid things for Ben Affleck to quip--""Why did you say that name!""But, I don't care how many times they do it, Superman still works in my book as an alien Christ figure, and this one actually does rather well exploring that beyond merely posing him in a crucifixion position and resurrecting him. And, sure, the super-battles are a lot of punching and pushing, plus noisy kabooms and Snyder's penchant for slow-mo and snap zooms, but that's what we came for, if not for the action being too long and not especially original in construction.... Wonder Woman is fun, though. ""Is She with You?,"" or the Woman Woman theme music, from Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL 's soundtrack is great. Gal Gadot steals the show, and Wonder Woman saved this cinematic universe, such as it is now, from the overly-maligned, but still flawed, ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman,"" through the justifiably-rubbished ""Suicide Squad"" (2016) and ""Justice League."" Time now to honor our corporate overlords by reviewing ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) in anticipation of the upcoming sequel."

I can see that majority of the people hate this 'cause of the pacing and the ""Martha"" scene. How 'bout for just a moment, we forget about the Martha scene and focus more on the depth of the story rather than criticising it blindly and intentionally. This is the most underrated superhero movie ever. Ben Affleck as Batman was an excellent choice specifically for Frank Miller's version. Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman after Christopher Reeve. Okay, i admit it. There was some unexplained and not-so-making-sense scenes in the theatrical cut but they corrected everything perfectly in the extended cut. And also i noted most of the people hated Zack's Dark theme. But i loved it. It's a different experience, to be precise for a superhero movie like we've already see in Snyder's other movies such as Man of Steel and Watchmen. Zack is a wonderful director. Stop hating his methods. Everybody wants to see some fights between the two heroes but no one cares about the depth and reason for their turns. People just wants some action and action and no content? That's it? I mean that's how a movie is supposed to be? No. That's just Narrow-minded thinking. Zack executed everything accordingly and brilliantly. The fight between Batman and Superman was iconic. And okay the first half pacing was a bit slow and the second half was pretty fast. And Bruce's rapid change of heart was understandable but they could've added more conversations between Bruce and Clark after their battle. Their battle was one for a lifetime without any doubt. And on contrary to popular opinion, i don't hate Jesse as Luthor. His performance and dialogue settings was phenomenal. The movie's overall screenplay was absolutely brilliant especially when Bruce and Clark confronted each other in Luthor's party. Despite a few mistakes i've already mentioned above, i love this movie. And i always will!Performances : 99/100Screenplay : 96/100Visuals : 86/100Pacing : First half ; 85/100

" Tedious. Jesse Eisenberg BADLY over acting as Lex.
",-0.5904,-0.6155,2020-11-28 00:00:00,1,"Where to start with this sprawling, mess of a movie? It starts with promise tying to the climatic finish of Man of Steel-also overlong and tedious. But I think what makes this movie especially awful is Jesse Eisenberg's truly awful - GOD-awful portrayal of Lex Luthor. At times he seems to be trying to channel Jack Nicholson's manic joker, but then jumping to forgettable blandness as if he can't make up his mind minute to minute. He never feels believable, threatening, or menacing, just over acting and cringeworthy. The hairstyle isn't doing the character any favors either.The titular fight is meh with Afleck's grunty Batman voice giving some unintended comic relief. Again the fight is overlong, tedious, and seems to have about ten climaxes where you think it is finally, thankfully over, but no it's not.
My mom's name is Martha too? Eye rolling. Seriously???The only times when the movie perks up is when Wonderwoman makes a too rare appearance - even her theme song makes you feel like- ""At last maybe there's some saving this mess after all."" But no, it's just a tease."

" Hero from above vs Hero from below
",0.802,0.977,2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,"Zac Snyders redemption from Man of Steel. In this 2nd installment to the DC Extended universe we see the raw emotion from billionaire Bruce Wayne as he watches the world crumble around him and lives destroyed of the people he was responsible for, this all comes from war brought to Earth chasing after the life of Superman we saw in the series' first instalment. As the two vigilantes hate grows more for the other a new enemy rises from the shadows.In this film we really get to see great story making come to life from characters we are already very familiar with. These new story lines for each character give a new look and emotional connection to each character. For Example: In this movie Batman does not gloat around with his riches but yet struggles throughout the film with the wound of his parents death and inability to save those he cares for the most in both his childhood and present. With Clark we get to see true bravery and selflessness shine through as he gives up all he has multiple times to save those who he is is closest to. We get a much more realistic role from Lois in this movie, the relationship she has with her boss really helps bring her character to life as she stays rebellious but holds the heart our story revolves around. She has the characteristics and morals that our heroes wish to posses but cant because of their already amazing abilities."

I used to hate Henry Carvill's version of superman. I used to hate this movie, that is, until I watched the ultimate edition!Now I have to say that it's an amazing film! While it still has some minor flaws, it's an absolute treat to watch.You have to keep in mind that this Bruce is not the batman you know anymore. After losing everyone including Robin, he has abandoned his one rule. He has become more depressed and violent. This movie shows that Batman shouldn't kill by showing us how he is ready to let the thugs die.This Clark is not the superman yet. He's new to the process. He has just started wearing the suit and the whole world fears him and looks at him like a false God.

Neither the gravity of the other planets nor the friction speed of the matter will allow the parts of the planet to reach the earth.

" Big, earnest, and over-complicated
",0.5106,0.9965,2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"The sequel to Man of Steel feels both of the previous film and decidedly apart. Where the first one had a rough visual aesthetic with a lot of hand held camera work, the sequel largely sidesteps that. Where the first explored character in a solid block before giving way to a relatively straightforward plot in the second half, the sequel is mired in an overcomplicated plot from the first scene. The ambition is still there, though, to tell a story of epic scope, and while I definitely don't think of this as a masterpiece, I do find so much to enjoy.My favorite part of this whole this is probably Ben Affleck as Batman and Bruce Wayne. He could be the older version of Michael Keaton's Batman. He's grizzled and has been doing his dark knighting for a very long time. The destruction at the appearance of the Superman broke him, though. He watched a flying god fight another flying god and level Metropolis. He knew people who died because of it. As a man who's been fighting freaks in clown makeup for twenty years, he's suddenly faced with an existential threat in the form of a superman who, if he decided he wanted to for whatever reason, enslave and destroy the entire planet (something he dreams of at one point). His monomaniacal focus on fighting Superman is the best part of the movie, and Affleck plays that rage really well.In order to get there, the movie has a very, very involved plot that goes from an African tribal warlord and terrorist, independent security contractors, mystery bullets, Congressional hearings, a Senator blocking an import license, a former Wayne Enterprises employee and his checks that never got to him from his injury, and a few other things along the way. Cutting through it all late in the movie, it all boils down to: Lex Luthor, billionaire, is manipulating Superman, Batman, and the media to drive a wedge between everyone in an effort to get Batman to kill Superman or to get Superman to kill Batman. The former rids the world of the threat of Superman. The latter shows the world that Superman is not worthy of praise or worship and turns the world against him.A quick note in the middle: I've only ever seen the Ultimate Cut of this movie. I've never seen the Theatrical Cut. The Ultimate Cut's plot is a challenge to assemble, but it's ultimately doable. I've read that it's impossible in the Theatrical Cut. For that alone, I'd recommend the Ultimate Cut if you're interested in checking it out. I've owned the Theatrical Cut since I bought the Blu-ray, and I've never even bothered to start it.Now, this plot is a lot. It's too much, and it really needed to be pared back a little bit at the least. Cutting the African warlord would have been a good first step, but it needed to be addressed at the script level, and not in editing. The African warlord does end up paying off, but it's about two hours after he'd disappeared from the film, leaving a lot of little things for the audience to keep track of that all end up being distractions.Outside of that, though, I think this movie is really smart. It's an exploration of the messianic and apocalyptic implications of Superman revealing himself to the planet. He gets worshiped, and he gets feared, and the public are easily swayed in each direction. That manifests most in how Luthor is able to manipulate Bruce Wayne into homicidal rage against Superman. That Bruce Wayne starts from a point of anger makes the manipulation work dramatically. It should also be said that at no point does the audience feel ahead of the characters in unraveling the plot because the plot is so complicated, so there's never a point where, no matter what the audience's consideration of Batman's motives or actions, the audience will wonder how Wayne could be so stupid to fall for such a easy to figure out scheme because it's kind of impossible to figure out. So there's a positive for the pretty much incomprehensible plot as it plays out.Superman is in a tough place as this all works. He just wants to do good, what's in his nature, but even his mother is saying that he doesn't need to put up with all this nonsense, that he owes the world nothing. There are pressures for him to simply stop trying to help, but he refuses. That refusal is key to Luthor's plan. He needs to be good so that Luthor can prove him to be bad, to put him in an impossible position and force him to choose wrong. Superman, in a fallen world, finds it impossible to stay as good as his ideals demand of him.I find this approach to the two main characters really interesting and a great way to get through the adventure. Outside of it, the movie has a lot going for it as well. Expensively produced, the movie embraces a dark visual palate that fits the darker thematic approach to the comic book material. Within that, the brooding nature of Batman and Gotham City fit like a glove, and the more somber approach to Superman's place in the world fits as well. Whether you like that approach to a super hero more generally viewed as a bright and shining beacon seems to amount to personal taste and attachment to the source material, but I've never been that attached to Superman as an ideal, so I'm good with it.As I said before, Ben Affleck is probably my favorite Batman, and Henry Cavil plays the conflicted nature of this Superman well. Amy Adams is a quality Lois Lane, and I kind of love the manic, twitchy performance of Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor.Now, I want to address the Martha moment. Just for the record, my wife watched this with me on this most recent viewing, and she hadn't seen it before. She did not laugh hysterically like I thought she would at the Martha moment, so there's that. The Martha moment doesn't come out of nowhere, the clues are there that Superman knows his mother and Bruce's mother have the same name, that Bruce is still doing what he's doing out of a need to make up for his parents' death, and that reason hasn't gotten through to him. He needs to get Batman to think differently, and an emotional punch should do. I think the moment could be set up better to help, but it ultimately still doesn't completely work. What is it about Martha Kent having the same first name as Martha Wayne that gets Batman to stop trying to kill Superman? I'm unclear. What does Bruce Wayne suddenly see in him? It's, well, it's unclear. This is a first draft idea rushed into production. It needed to be better ironed out because I think the idea has merit in general, but in execution it leaves a good bit to be desired.All in all, though, the Ultimate Cut of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is a ride through a complex plot with some interesting stuff on its mind at the same time. There's great spectacle along the way as well. It could have used more time as a script to hammer some stuff out and clear some stuff up, but as it is, I find it an entertaining three hours."

When watching this however I found it much better than reviews would leave me to believe, Ben affleck is phenomenal as Batman, and I for one can't wait to see him return in Zack Snyders Justice League next year, and the flash if that rumour is true. Henry cavill does a fine job as superman again, hopeful he will return one day too. The ultimate edition fills in a lot of gaps that many people, myself included, were slightly critical of and I feel if the ultimate edition was what was shown in theatres, this movie would have a much better reputation. 27% on rotten tomatoes is a joke.

The exception is Jesse Eisenberg, who at least brings some new fresh perspective. I liked him as an actor but I was used to see him in comedies and I didn't think I'd like him as a villain, but his were probably the best parts for my taste.But it basically comes down to Batman wanting to kill Superman because he thinks he can't be trusted and is too powerful to be left alive. And then, when he is about to do so, they turn into BFF just because he learns that both their mothers share the same name.

Please try to consider the following:
First 'horror' scene of Batman appearance scene
Batman and Alfred investigation steps
The best 'Darkside' dream and Flash prediction
First confrontation between Superman and Batman
Introduction and interception of Wonder Woman
The magnificent evil plan of Luthor (present and future)
The presentation of strongest man on earth and the big conflict
The legendary battle of Batman with gang to save Superman's mother (rewind each move)
The last battle of best DC characters
Best representing soundtrack that I never stopped to listen after years, each perfect to its regarding scene
And way more and more
What more do you expect from a comic book movie but a dream came true?
I hope the best to Snyder in future projects and never to estimate capabilities of all participants in the movie.

" A Disappointingly Convoluted Mess
",-0.6597,-0.8964,2020-09-26 00:00:00,4,"As a fan of Man of Steel, I found this follow-up to be very disappointing. From a storytelling perspective, the clunkily titled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a convoluted mess. The films many subplots make for an unfocused and unengaging narrative. And while the Ultimate Edition does make the character motivations a lot clearer, the script is poorly written.One of its main redeeming qualities is its cast. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Bruce Wayne/Batman, giving an interesting interpretation of the character that distinguishes him from previous incarnations. Cavill is once again excellent as Superman, although I wanted to see more from him. Given that this was initially intended to be a direct sequel to Man of Steel, it is disappointing to see Superman sidelined to some extent. Gal Gadot debuts as Wonder Woman and is also ideally suited to the role, even if it does feel that her character is completely unnecessary in the movie. The weak point of the cast is, without a doubt, Jesse Eisenberg. His performance as Lex Luthor is genuinely awful and irritating throughout. His attempts at bringing humour and levity to the otherwise dour tone of the film fall flat on every occasion. He is a one-dimensional villain who never feels threatening to the heroes. Given this serious and sombre tone, Eisenberg feels as if he is in a different movie.The film does an excellent job of presenting a version of Batman that still feels fresh despite the numerous versions presented on screen over the years. Stylistically, Zack Snyder and his team do a great job. Everything from the suits to the Batmobile, to the Bat Cave, are all visually appealing and feel different from what came before. Being introduced to an older, more experienced Batman was also a choice that worked well. There was no need to redo Batman's origin once again as it is known so well in popular culture. Jeremy Irons is solid as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, although he can't quite live up to the iconic portrayal given by Michael Caine in the Dark Knight Trilogy. While it may not have been essential to see the death of Bruce Wayne's parents once again, it did set the tone for the movie to come, and its stylised presentation was well executed.As this film was originally conceived as a standalone Superman sequel, the storyline for the Man of Steel is particularly disappointing. It begins on a positive note, dealing with his place in the modern world, and his accountability for the destruction he leaves behind him. However, this subplot which involves Superman going before the US Senate is abruptly ended, having little to no impact on the plot. His death at the hands of Doomsday feels unearned and left me cold. To make matters worse, the final shot of the film which all but confirms that he will return from the dead makes his sacrifice even less impactful than it already is.The main problem with this film is its awful script. It is full of flashbacks, dreams and visions which seem entirely pointless and become tiresome very quickly. These include a dream involving a giant CGI bat and a scene between Clark Kent and his deceased father, played by Kevin Costner. The most frustrating of all, however, is the dream-within-a-dream sequence which involves a full-on action set piece in an apocalyptic version of the future along with a scene involving the Flash from the future. Given that the character of the Flash hasn't even been introduced yet makes this extremely confusing for the casual viewer. If all four of these scenes were removed, I don't believe the film would suffer in any way.The Metahumans subplot was also utterly irrelevant to this story and was a blatant advertisement for the upcoming Justice League. It felt like a quick and lazy setup for the characters of Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg. And while Gal Gadot was great in the role, Wonder Woman did not belong in this movie and should have been introduced in her solo outing the following year. This entire subplot feels as if Warner's/DC had seen the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and were quickly trying to get up to speed with their superhero counterparts.While the stylised cinematography is useful for distinguishing this films Caped Crusader from other versions of Batman such as the Dark Knight Trilogy, the overuse of CGI was frustrating in several places, most notably the Batmobile chase set-piece. This overuse of digital effects in this sequence, along with others, effected my level of engagement, as they didn't feel real or grounded.Although brief, the fight sequence between Batman and Superman was the best part of the movie. The stylised action scene was exciting, violent and inventive. Batman's armoured suit was very cool and unlike any of his previous on-screen outfits. It was the only sequence in the movie that I wished had lasted a little longer. The infamous ""Martha"" revelation which puts an abrupt end to the fight was rather flimsy and unintentionally funny. The follow-up warehouse action sequence was also exhilarating, being both well-choreographed and violent.Once this fight sequence ends, the film begins to fall apart. The late introduction of Doomsday added nothing to the movie. Its dull, CGI design reminded me of the Abomination from The Incredible Hulk. It was yet another one-dimensional villain, without any personality or excitement.Overall, this film was very disappointing. While it has excellent individual moments such as the titular showdown, the costume design and the cast (for the most part), the script is an appalling mess."

",-0.1685,0.9442,2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"I am surprised at how much anger there was towards this movie, but it may have something to do with the difference in the viewers' ages and how long a person has been reading/following comics and the length of that person's exposure to the genre. There was a huge out-cry back in the 80s to make things more believable in the comics (meaning how would it look/work in the real world), and serious (meaning heroes need to bleed more when they are facing a bad guy), and I think that turning point created a lot of conflicts with what came before that.Now we have a lot of people with different interpretations on how ""their"" Batman/Superman should be like on the big screen. Well, maybe I'm spoiled now but, I'm just happy that cinematic technology has finally brought us to a place that allows us to see what it might look like if it was in the real-world. I think this film nailed that. I thought the ""Martha"" thing was brilliant. It was a quick way to remind us of what psychological crap is going on in Batman's head. Either way I like this film a lot. My only problem with it was, ""How did Gotham end up across the bay from Metropolis all of a sudden""? That was weird.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB"

The script deals in a simple way to bring all the characters together, introducing little by little characters like Batman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor in this universe created in Man of Steel. The justifications for creating a clash between Superman and Batman are valid, no creating a struggle just to have destruction. Batman was a big focus of the film, but Wonder Woman stole the attention every scene that appeared. The fight scenes are very well done, they create a great emotion in the viewer. And we have an ending that gives an epic kick in the Justice League, much more than a post-credit scene, the DC Universe was established and with a great mystery to be unraveled over the years.Film reviewed on the 13th to the 14th day of September 2020."
" First Batman movie I ever hated
",-0.6369,0.9867,2020-09-06 00:00:00,1,First of all I am a huge Bat fan since I was 10 years old thats going on 30 years I am also a dc comic reader This is not Batman. Batman doesn't kill. He so believes in redemption that he will try to save you if he can. Examples In a death in The family The Joker killed Jason Todd Bruce 2nd Robin and adopted son. Bruce didn't kill him When the Joker paralyze Barbara Gordon from the waist down Bruce has said he considers her family I aways thought there relationship was like uncle and niece Bruce didn't kill him When Nightwing the first robin Bruce adopted son killed the joker Bruce revived him now lets get to superman. SuperMan also has a similar moral code to Bruce he doesn't believe in killing He puts them in the phantom zone were they can't harm anyone I wonder if the writers read stories like the killing Joke death in the family or Hush because There is so much lore were Batman and Super Man who our best friends don't believe in killing

" Review: Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice
",0.5267,0.9455,2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,"I have to admit, I really struggled to watch Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice this week. This was the first time that I viewed it since I originally watching it in theaters back in 2016. I had high hopes for this movie with it having an great cast of characters: Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, and with the following reprising their roles from Man of Steel (2013) Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurance Fishburne as Perry White the Editor in Chief of the Daily Planet, Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, and Diane Lane as Martha Kent. I remember a lot of my original criticisms from that initial viewing. Mainly that the lighting during the majority of the movie made it extremely hard to make out most details. I did come up with more criticisms this viewing then I thought that I would since I am a huge DC fan. I give every movie a clean slate upon viewing, so I was disappointed when I came up with more criticisms then positive comments.Other than the lighting throughout the movie being extremely dark and making it difficult to view any of the smaller details and some of that larger details in scenes. I found the overall storyline to be jumbled mess. One moment it comes across as an original story, then a Flashpoint storyline, next it has Injustice story vibes, and then The Death of Superman. I felt that they could not pick where they wanted to go with the future of the DC Universe after this movie so they tried to cram in as many of storylines that they possible could, so this movie was the hook for the future of the universe. I would have just liked a straightforward story that could have been the hook for the Justice League movie since the tag line was the ""Dawn of Justice."" Also, how could anybody think that the climatic fight between Batman and Superman ending because Superman yells out Martha and Batman having a flashback to his mother being a good idea. To me that seemed like a rushed and sloppy ending to what could have been an amazing action sequence.Overall, I do not see myself watching this movie again even though I bought it from Best Buy when it was on sale this past week for the DC Fandome event. I am extremely disappointed in storyline, the lighting, and the fact that I don't see this moving having a rewatchable quality. I originally gave it a 7/10 when I first watched it back in 2016. I have to lower my score with this second viewing to a 5/10 because of the reasons that I listed above. It was a 3 hour long jumbled mess of a superhero movie that left you wishing they had done less with better lighting."

But when the Ultimate edition came, I was surprised that the Extended version of the film had more story to tell. The emotion, the pain, the tragedy, the justice of both superman and batman is very clear. What's more interesting is that the key character of the story is both lex luthor and Lois lane as they are the gaps to fill the narration.
Zack really did an amazing job, however if he had released this version in theatres, It would have been a hit."

" Theatrical cut was good BUT the Ultimate Edition is fantastic.
",0.743,0.9721,2020-09-01 00:00:00,10,"The 2nd successful movie in the DCEU. Nearly 30 odd years since reading both The Dark Knight Returns and The Death Of Superman I have been waiting to see an adaptation into live action cinema and FINALLY it has arrived in this absolute epic of a movie. Henry Cavill nails superman again in a realistic world where a man is technically a god among men, dealing with both trying to be a hero and also trying to live his own life in a political world where people can switch sides in weather they like you or on not on a dime and who you listen to. Then you have Batman by Ben Affleck and he absolutely nails the character along with Irons as Alfred, Affleck bring that seasoned veteran of 30+ years who has seen it all until the events of Man Of Steel. Brings the troubling battle with PTSD over the loss of Robin at the hands of the Joker which clearly still haunt him, the level of brutality as you would expect from an adaptation of the best interpretation of Batman.....Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. Gal Gadot is beautiful as ever as the gleaming amazon warrior princess and also nails the role.
I very much enjoyed the theatrical cut but like some people noticed some elements felt like they were missing....THEN along came The Ultimate Edition and REAL movie by Zack Snyder in over 3hrs of visual, scene stealing, dialogue engaging, character developing glory.10/10 easily one of my favourite super hero movies in the last 30 years and will take some beating along with Man Of Steel to take number 1 and 2 spots on my list......Zack Snyders Justice League may do it so bring on 2021."

It almost demands you do so. Zacks a huge fan and pours scenes and dialogue directly from the comics. He details every single frame. Hes a graphic novel type storyteller. BvS asks real questions about super heros and the human condition in a time when all people wanted was comedy and flair. And was rated harshly because of it.Cant believe i never wrote a review for this movie as it is one of my favorites.Eisenbergs Lex origin story is awesome and i find myself quoting his lines just as much as Batmans. Afleck was superb. Clark struggles with a world that doesnt know if it wants to accept him after MoS and sets up an amazing discussion over aliens and super-powered beings.

" An underrated comic film
",0.0,0.1406,2020-08-25 00:00:00,9,"After watching Man of Steel, it is clear that Zack Synder's interpretation of DC's superheroes is more grounded as it is set in a more realistic world. Batman V Superman is no different as it is a direct continuation from Man of Steel, which gives the first look into the devastation and consequences of the battle between Superman and Zod. The batman in this story is an older and more experienced than previous films. Ben Affleck's batman is seen to have lost hope as it's hinted that despite his efforts to make Gotham better, it still is just as crime ridden as when he first started. This batman also has lost robin to the Joker and Harley so his moral compass is shown to be damaged and his desperation at stopping superman is clear.The CGI, soundtrack and fight scenes are all perfectly put together. The film is very underrated and heavily marked down due to the creative choices that Synder made (the tone, batman killing, superman being less 'fun' than other Superman films and the famous 'Martha scene') However, these scenes actually make sense in the world and experiences that these characters are put in, but these scenes do make more sense with one or more rewatches.Again the style is not everyone's cup of tea but
It is nice to a fresh and different approach to batman and superman that hasn't been done before."

",0.0,0.9661,2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,This edition or the directors cut which Zack intended to release in theatres was cut down to a 2:30 hours movie by the studio. The only version I recommend to watch is the ultimate edition which shows every detail perfectly. I literally love this version and for me this has been one of the greatest CBM of all time. Never can one imagine bringing the best DC characters on live screen and doing justice to each one of them.

" Visually dazzling, quite entertaining
",0.4927,0.9804,2020-08-24 00:00:00,7,"That Batman V Superman is nowhere near the level of Nolan's Masterful Dark Knight Trilogy is a given, so even trying to compare the two is ludicrous. However, on its own merit, it manages to deliver; mostly. Trying to make Superman a brooding and complex character is largely nonsensical, and a lot of the themes the movie tries to play with aren't incorporated very well, instead of being introduced through dialogue or the plot itself, it's conveyed through News stories or the like. But when it comes to the overall style of the movie, it's much better. The distinctive Snyder cinematography and direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's and Junkie XL's music is all definitely great. Ben Affleck isn't too shabby either, in his own right, even though Christian Bale shall always remain the true Batman for me, and maybe now Robert Pattinson in the upcoming The Batman movie. Definitely entertaining, 7/10."
" Bruce Wayne v Superman: No Franchise Justice
",0.296,0.7858,2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Hmm... where to start with this. Well, visually the film is stunning... and that's pretty much where the positives end. The pacing and plot are absolutely all over the place, with dream sequences and flashbacks that come out of nowhere giving the film an inconsistent flow. The action scenes, bar one, are not very satisfying, Wonder Woman feels shoehorned in for the sake of making sequels, and there's far more Bruce Wayne than Batman... which is fine - but the film just never really ups the ante. Combined with the dull gritty tone with no relief we are left with an experience that doesn't really do Batman or Superman any.. justice (sorry)."

Underneath the tree is a big wrapped box with your name on it. Excited, you grab the box and rip the paper off eager to see what's inside. When you open the box all there is, is a giant package of tube socks. You feel extremely disappointed, and become sad.Watching Batman V Superman is like receiving socks as a kid on Christmas morning only multiplied by 100. This movie is long, preachy, and poorly written. Features an incredibly cringey and awful performance by Jesse Eisenberg. Batman spending 90% of the movie trying to kill Superman only to be stopped by a safe word. Batman's safe word(again). A villain shoehorned in at the last minute. It reminds me a lot of Joel Schumacher's 1997 hemorrhoid Batman and Robin. That movie was a mess, and this movie is a mess as well. It took 20 years but there is finally another Batman film that's comparable to that awful movie. While that movie was campy and stupid, this movie is dull, and so poorly paced you will have to do everything you can to stay awake. 2016 wasn't kind to DC, and considering what came after this oh boy.

Sure, the writing sucks, the tone is too serious to even be taken seriously, and Jesse Eisenberg could've played anyone else other than Lex Luthor, but it looks cool, is very entertaining, reasonably well acted, and it often stays true to the comics.

" Incoherent, bizarre, stylish, pretty, but mindless action
",-0.5267,0.9895,2020-08-17 00:00:00,3,"Not every movie has to be brilliantly scripted. I'm perfectly fine with watching a dumb action movie if the action is really good or novel in some way.The action in Batman v. Superman is indeed pretty good when it occurs.....But there is surprisingly little of it compared to what you might expect....A lot of the movie is people talking and not in a remotely good way...Unfortunately, Zack Snyder seems to be incapable of developing coherent dialogue and story. Even if a movie is not aiming to be sophisticated (As none of Zack Snyder's movies ever are) when the dialogue doesn't even connect or flow with the plot it makes it very hard to track what is going on or why.Batman v. Superman suffers greatly from this problem. Characters randomly muse about unbelievable things without prompting, just to establish their motivations to move the plot forward. Sometimes they don't even seem to be responding to what another character said or to surrounding events. This clunkiness breaks the immersion of the audience in the film world.There are many good actors in this movie, but they don't really get to act with this script. Henry Cavill is an all right Superman. I didn't care for Ben Affleck's Batman, but I guess it was passable. Gal Gadot is still a fine Wonder Woman. Amy Adams is always great and is one of the few people to bring life to their role in this film. The only truly dreadful performance/casting decision was Jesse Eisenburg as Lex Luthor. I don't get an evil genius vibe from Jesse Eisenburg's schtick at all......He comes across as more smarmy, playful, and somewhat annoying than evil genius....Not having a good primary antagonist also really hurt the film very badly..The conflict between Batman and Superman (By attempting to paint Superman as the secondary antagonist) is not believable even from the first few minutes. This would have been okay if the movie had simply glossed over the unbelievable aspect of it and moved on. But the film spends almost an hour trying to convince the audience repeatedly that the conflict is believable when it just isn't. The film tries to convince the audience of this through a lot of incoherent talking where characters insist on their bizarre reasons for doing or believing certain things. This badly harmed the pacing of the movie and made it rather dull for most of the first half. That isn't excusable for a movie trying to lean on being action packed and fast-paced....These aren't new problems for Zack Snyder as a film maker. But this is clearly a step back for him as a director even from movies like 300, The Watchmen or Man of Steel where some of these problems were present to a lesser degree.I can't recommend people invest hours in this film as it is. It's worth skipping. These people giving it 10 stars are clearly part of the crowd that inflates reviews for film studios because this is definitely not a good movie at all. And no, the Ultimate Edition did not fix the problems."

",-0.5423,0.9895,2020-08-13 00:00:00,3,"I really tried to like this movie. But it's just horrible. And i love Zack Snyders work, he is an amazing director when it comes to capture scenes. He is a very visual director and that's what i love about every of his former movie.But this one is a major fail. Snyder is the perfect director to make a great script into a visually stunning movie. He is great in elevating an existing masterwork. But he is unable to create one.This movie is a testiment for that. While certain scenes are simply marvellous, the script lacks pretty much everything a good script needs. No depth, no cleverness, no style. The dialogues are forcing a pathos in such a painful way, it's comical. And that's a shame, taken the talent that's on screen. Henry Caville feels like he was chiseled out of marble to play the role of the man of steel. Yet the script gives him painfully ridiculous lines to say, you might just feed Superman kryptonite and end up in the same place.Next to the dialogue are the ridiculous script decisions. In this movie Batmans has no problem murdering bad boys with the help of firearms. Yet when it comes to face Superman, he trusts his fate to ... a spear?! You can hardly create a more ""MacGuffin""-item than that.The whole script oozes pathos left and right to the point it becomes comical. And when it tries to be comical, it fails. Most scenes feel like out of place in a super hero movie. And any conclusion coming out of this comes across as idiotic.Please, Mr. Snyder, listen to people."

" An enjoyable superhero flick.
",0.4404,0.9117,2020-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Due to pressure from the studio, Snyder was forced to edit down this movie to make way for a more acceptable film-length. This resulted in a less coherent experience for the viewer and ultimately the reason why the film received such mixed reviews.At its heart, it's a love letter to the story of Batman. Affleck nails the performance and Snyder clearly loves riffing off the star's bleak interpretation of the Dark Knight. Outside of that character, the movie struggles to tell its story, mainly due to lightning-quick jumps from one sub-plot to the next. It's not really until almost half-way through that the movie find its gear.Because of this, the Ultimate Edition lifted the experience for me, the opening hour or so is far more digestible and allows the movie to grow.There are some amazing, jaw dropping scenes in this film, though. The fight between Clark and Bruce is exceptionally crafted and the Batman fight-scene, where Batman single-handedly breaks the bones of twenty thugs is wonderful stuff to see.Overall, this is a fairly good film. Unfortunately though, it can't be anything more. The editing is the biggest issue, that and the casting of Lex Luther and a rather disappointing CGI-laden Doomsday.Snyder and Affleck deserved a shot at a solo Batman outing after this, in my opinion, as when this movie shines on the Bat, it is very good indeed."

Zack Snyder is really a genius. I don't understand the hate on this film perhaps some critics are not paying attention to the details. Ben affleck's Batman is a fresh take for the cape crusader I love his bruce wayne portayal and Batman's costume is the best in live action history. All of the costume are good and accurate. I love the effort of the creators of the film and their references to the comic book.

He could easily tell the world the truth that the deaths was accidental and he didn't mean to hurt anybody while SAVING THE WHOLE DAMN PLANET. But it's okay, nobody's perfect, even gods make mistakes so let's move on to our next character which is Bruce Wayne. This dude right here is a certified narcissist. He cannot easily accept the fact that Superman is more powerful than him and Lex Luther has something that is considered as Superman's weakness. Instead of making a partnership with Lex, Bruce secretly hacked his system and plans to steal the stone.Other than that, the dialogues are cool. Most of the antagonists' sentences contains deeper meaning and I will count that as one of the good characteristics of this movie. But for me, the storyline is too shallow and not realatable to most audience. But if you like dark and comic-like films, you can try this :)"

I was not a fan of Zack until I saw Man of Steel and then BvS. He is good in portraying different superhero characters in frame and no-doubt he has done a great job. I have watched it on Amazon Prime as well, but did not enjoy as many important scenes were removed. I have the DVD uncut version of it and I enjoy watching this film all the time."

",0.7003,-0.8984,2020-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Good acting (for the most part), interesting story and Batman is realistic. Anyone saying Batman is too dark has probably only seen him in the theaters. The biggest problem with the movie is the poor choice of actor in lex luther. This could probably have been fixed by replacing the actor and tying the looks change into some freak chemical or genetic accident or something. The other problem is that the film shifted away from Batman vs Superman. I think when you name the story as such, adding extra things is not an issue as long as it does not detract from the main title and main story. In this case it did and I found that an issue. Let's be real though, the best thing about this movie is this version of Batman. Unfortunately everyone knows that WB messed this up badly with their lack of patience and incompetence. They probably could have made record sales with this Batman...oh well. Other than that it was good."

The theatrical version was one of the worst cinema going experience I had all due to the film itself being a choppy mess that felt like separate music video or vine videos put into one. This film, for some reason with the added time helps pacing with believability to the film's choices of character decisions. In my opinion, the ultimate edition is the watchable and decent film, while the theatrical cut is garbage and the horrible version of bad Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Little scenes matter in films directed by someone who is a visual filmmaker known for literally his elements and story beats told through visual storytelling. This might be why the theatrical version is rough. The ultimate edition saved this film for me and has made this film one of the top DCEU films to date IMO."

So they added 1/2 hr just to keep it pretty much the same movie except they made sure to set up more sequels? It's almost cynical to think that their very mediocre series is worthy of more bloated movies that will just be mediocre. I don't understand why adding to an already bloated movie was supposed to help anything and why every single fanboy thinks new versions will solve poor storytelling, odd acting, schlocked on cgi, and clunky directing.Fanboys, please note: superhero movies will never be great movies while soulless corporations own them. They are fun and entertaining (something DC can't seem to understand most of the time) , but that's about it. $ spent does not equal a good movie and for every $ spent, soulless corporations need to make more and more money, therefore by definition they can't do it good enough to make great movies."

Probably because, like many others, I too wanted it to be like Avengers or better than Avengers. And never giving it a thought that the characterizations and tone of both the universes is way different.This was never meant to be similar to the MCU or compete it.Today when I watched the ultimate edition, I felt this movie is way too underrated. The storytelling feels unrushed in this edition. You get to know a lot more details about a few events and characters. You are invested a lot more in the characters. If you are a fan, definitely watch the ultimate edition.Waiting for the Snyder's cut of Justice league."

But the idea that Superman has been around for 2 years & has saved countless lives apparently means nothing. He makes 1 mistake to save the woman he loves & all of a sudden he needs to die? How many lives has he saved vs the handful of people who died in the desert, dumb. Then when the fight between them starts Batman should have died at least 3 times, I don't know any humans that can be thrown through Multiple concrete walls & then into a huge electrical light & get up to be fine. There is a scene where a guy shoots batman point blank right in the head twice & hes totally fine but then 2 seconds later a guy is able to stab him? His suit is bulletproof yet not knife proof? From what I remember from the comics Batman's whole thing that he doesn't kill, he also is never supposed to use a gun, yet he kills dozens of people in this movie while using large guns, so I'm confused.

" Lifeless and flat

Eisenberg plays as a twitching weirdo with none of the depth and all of the tics. It's a profoundly irritating feat of overacting - he's less cartoon-ish villain and more villainous cartoon. It doesn't help that this overlong film a lot of the times is an astounding bore, too. Film also features African terrorists, Russian mafia, Justice Leaguers The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, an alien autopsy, congressional Superman hearings, Kryptonite weaponry, dream sequences with flying insect-men and gothic gargoyles, spaceships, the Batmobile and Batwing, nuclear bombs, and a CGI monster that feels like it was borrowed from the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. If you might be wondering about the story that involves all these elements - there isn't one. ""Batman v Superman"" is a collection of striking scenes and imagery that has apparently been filmed without the benefit of a coherent screenplay to tie them together.

We see shots of Thomas and Martha Waynes funeral interwoven with shots of Bruce and his parents leaving the movies, and what transpires afterwards. Bruce runs away from the funeral proceedings and falls down an abandoned covered well,, where he finds a lot of new, winged friends (the shot of the bats and Bruce rising up is great!)Then we see a different version of the battle between Superman and Zod from Man of Steel,,, the version that Bruce sees from the ground in Metropolis. This is what sets Bruce off on his mission for most of this movie. He sees an alien monster fight that kills thousands of people and destroys a lot of Metropolis. He sees red.Flash forward 18 months,,, Superman saves Lois from terrorists in the desert,, and is made out to have killed a lot of innocent bystanders in doing so,,,At the same time in Gotham, people are scared,, especially the criminals. The Batman is taking on the job of judge, jury, and executioner in a lot of ways by branding criminals with his Batman symbol. Once
inside the prison, those branded are killed.I won't bother saying too many more things about the plot,,, don't want to give it all away.I do have to talk about one scene,, that has been horribly misunderstood and made fun of. The Martha scene - When I first saw the movie in theaters,, I thought the scene was great. Only after seeing all the backlash did I begin to question any of it. Batman wins the big fight between he and Superman. He does this by utilizing kryptonite found by Lex Luthor. Bruce makes 3 smoke bombs out of it, as well as a spear to deliver a final killing blow to Superman. After using 2 of the bombs on Superman, Batman has him down for the count, pinning him down by stepping on his throat! Before Batman drives the spear into him, Superman says, ""you're letting him kill Martha,"" (him referring to Luthor who's had Martha Kent kidnapped in order to force Superman into a showdown with Batman,,, cause Luthor has been playing them against each other). This of course throws Batman for a loop,, mostly bc his mother's name was Martha (and Luthor had manipulated him by saying he let his family die (referring to his work family, of course,, knowing this would haunt Bruce bc of what happened to his parents)). So, Batman's starts screaming, ""why did you say that name!?!"" It really messes with his head that Superman says this. Then Superman says, ""Find him,, save Martha."" Enraged,, Batman again screams, ""why did you say that name!?!"" Lois comes into the scene at this point and runs to plead for Superman's life. ""It's his mother's name! It's his mother's name!"" she says to Batman. Now,, my feelings about this scene may very well be different then others. I felt like Batman, upon hearing his own mothers name, started feeling guilty about who he'd allowed himself to become. The Batman we see in this movie (before this scene) is not the Batman that we've seen before. He's out for blood, in a way. He has convinced himself that Superman is an evil, alien being who will bring nothing but death and destruction to the world. He's convinced himself that it's his duty to neutralize this threat. Upon hearing Superman ask for his mother's life to be saved, and seeing Lois (who Wayne knows by reputation, at least) pleading for his life,, Batman realizes what he's allowed himself to become, and internally may wonder what would his parents think of him, and what he's doing. All of this coupled with the realization that he's been played (by Lex Luthor), makes Batman see that Alfred was right in an earlier scene of the movie (Alfred - ""The fever. The rage. The feelings of powerlessness. It turns good men cruel."") Batman steps away from Superman and Lois,, and throws the kryptonite spear away.
Now, a lot of people have referred to this as a sudden 180 where Batman and Superman become best friends bc their mothers shared the same name. That's fine if you see it that way,,, I just think you're completely wrong. The names being the same is (according to Snyder) how they started to create this scene. The main point is that Batman sees his errors and changes. He realizes that his been wrong (a lot of which is thanks to Luthor's manipulation), and wants to make things right with Superman (or as right as he can). That's what the scene is about!!!I really liked Alfred not only helps Batman. but also gets in on the action (like how he remotely takes control of the Batwing). I really wanted to see more of the banter between Bruce and Alfred, and their relationship,,, but of course there's only so much runtime, and we've seen that before,,,Now onto Wonder Woman,,, oh my!!! I loved how she was introduced in this movie. Plenty of screen time to be introduced, and plenty of back story, but not too much (sets up seeing her in WW perfectly).Okay, now that I've ranted for a good bit,,,Go watch it!!!"
" DISAPPOINTING
",-0.4939,0.6997,2020-06-25 00:00:00,5,"Considering that I really love ""Man of Steel,"" Zack Snyder's follow-up film ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a true disappointment in every way except for Wonder Woman, Affleck's performance and the fight between the titular heroes.Note: I saw the ultimate edition"
" Underrated and very misunderstood masterpiece
",0.399,0.5856,2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,"I'm gonna start by saying that this review is of the Ultimate Edition, which contains 30 minutes of extra footage and is vastly superior. I do, however love the theatrical edition aswell but it isn't as good.I absolutely adore this movie. Everything from Zimmer's and JunkieXL's bombastic score, to the deeply emotional and grounded character motivations, to the amazing portrayals of Batman and Superman.Sure, some elements of the movie doesn't work all that well. For example, Doomsday is a very bland and uninteresting villain, and Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of the iconic Lex Luthor is very strange. But even these odd/bad things do wonders for the story. Doomsday serves his purpose quite well and doesn't really need to be anything more, as he isn't a villain, but more of a tool to unity our heroes.The reason I believe this movie is disliked as much as it is, is, apart from studio meddling, that people came into it expecting a very action-heavy brawl between Batman and Superman, and instead got a very character driven, somber story about the duties and responsibilites of being a hero. And I can't blame them, that's how it was marketed, but it's not the focus of this film.Also, that warehouse fight-scene is the single best action scene of batman. ever."

" Cool action, but Otherwise really dumb.
",-0.6416,-0.9167,2020-06-15 00:00:00,3,"Most of it was dumb and convoluted, and Came across as if it was trying really hard to be edgy, and it just juggled too many things.It needed to be a Batman origin story for the DCU, and a Batman V Superman movie, and have Wonder Women and set up the Judtice league, and be a Lex Luther movie, and HAVE DOOMSDAY in it so it can COVER THE DEATH IF SUPERMAN!That being said, the action with Batman usually looks really cool and the actual fight between Batman and Superman especially looks Awesome, (despite the fact that their MOMS HAVE THE SAME NAME and that's why they stop fighting). The action is cool enough for me to almost recommend this film, but there's just too many problems with the story and pacing since they needed to cram in so much into one movie.Also, Batman's voice is really dumb."

",0.6239,0.8026,2020-06-13 00:00:00,9,"I was among those that actually enjoyed the theatrical cut although it had some flaws mostly regarding the story telling and the editing.I wasn't sure about what to expect from the extended version but oh boy! This shouldn't be considered as a movie with just some deleted scenes added. This probably IS the movie Snyder wanted us to see but some geniuses (sic) in WB decided that 3 hours is a bit too much for a theatrical release and chopped 30 minutes out of it.Story telling now fits together, characters' decisions make more sense and the action now complements it perfectly."
" Better than is given credit for
",0.6705,-0.9707,2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"This film was always going to be divisive, its a Zack Snyder film, with the added expectations of millions of fans of the source material. Although many shots missed, a few hit as well.First of all, as always, Snyder offers striking visuals and action. I also personally believe that Affleck was a good Batman, and was sad to see his probable exit from the DCEU. I also see Cavill as a good Superman, not though a Clark Kent. Also, up until half way in the film I bought Wayne's reason to hate Superman, the sequence at the start especially good. Finally, I quite like the nightmare sequence,and wished we could of seen Snyder's full vision for his Justice League trilogy.And the bad, there is a bit. First of all, as much as I like Eissenburg's character in this film, it is not a good Lex Luthor. His actions fit more of a riddler type, kind of mad, but clever as well. Overall my biggest problem with the film is Doomsday. This film did not need a CGI tadpole with teeth for a villain. Also, the death of Superman was stupid and emotionless. No one thought he was dead, and why couldn't Wonder Women stab him with the kryptonite spear.Better then I remember, and better than people say, but not the masterpiece the JL trilogy could of been."

First of all, I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half hours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). The action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it), but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other than that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as (or more than) I did."
" It's good

Regardless of some flaws,""Batman V Superman"" has some really significant sides to consider. snyder nailed it with his outstanding visuals like he does every time.

" Zack Snyder's flawed masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9718,2020-05-28 00:00:00,9,"BvS is the audacious Man of Steel sequel that WB and Zack Snyder knew the general public didn't want but thought they could sneak by them anyway by including Batman, Wonder Woman, and teasing Justice League. Lucky for the fans, they were wrong. The General Public hated it, but we loved it.It has a lot of the same themes and is a trial by fire just like MoS only this time, Batman and Lex Luther are the ones playing the bad guy and pulling the strings. You could argue that this makes it redundant to MoS and i wouldn't argue with that. I think its a complimentary piece to Man of Steel. It's the B-side, the Disc 2, of the same Album. It tells a different side of the same story.While MoS is a movie about an Alien finding his humanity and his place in our world, BvS is a movie about humans coming to terms with their place in a world where they are no longer at the top of the evolutionary ladder. And while in MoS the themes are explored through Clark's point of view, BvS explores them through Batman and Lex's point of view. They represent the part of humanity that doesn't worship this new Superman blindly as a god, but who fear and mistrust the power that Superman has and hates him for the powerlessness that he makes them feel. Again, BvS complements MoS and delves deeper into its core themes.Unfortunately as I alluded to before, it tries to do all that AND move the DCEU forward AND set-up Wonder Woman AND Justice League.
And while I loved Diana/WW/Gal, it was just too much. That stuff along with the Martha scene where Batman is all of a sudden cool with Supes where the only things I disliked about BvS. The Martha scene and friendship happened way too fast and didn't feel earned. Everything else was great.Some other things that jumped out at me while re-watching were how much more emotionally impactful Superman's sacrifice was at the end. This was because this version of the movie had more scenes between Lois & Clark and scenes of Clark's investigation of Batman.In general, the plot of the Extended Edition is much more fleshed out. Clearer. Lex's motivation, his plot to setup Superman, Lois' investigation, Batman's revenge journey, Lois & Clark's arc, etc. were all well developed and made perfect sense. The cinematography and score were stupendous. The cast tremendous. Zack Snyder's directing was superb. Gorgeous visuals and jaw dropping action. And lastly, Chris Terrio's script, especially his dialogue, blew me away."

" A Classic of the Superhero Genre
",0.0,0.9962,2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"Batman V Superman was made by people who know, love and understand comic book history and superhero mythology to their core. This movie is in the great tradition of mature superhero graphic novels that DC Comics started with The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen. It doesn't give us the simplistic, one-dimensional heroes that other film franchises do. It portrays superheroes at their most realistic, complex, conflicted, complicated and fascinating. As they would if they existed in real life, the Batman and Superman of this movie have to face not only the obvious threat of supervillains but also a skeptical, sometimes hostile public and the risk of moral compromise within themselves. Director Zack Snyder understands that the greater the challenges a superhero faces, the more heroic they are when they finally overcome them. This storyline is one of the most relevant, dramatic and fascinating ever seen in a superhero film.Aside from its powerful thematic material, the movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. But not in a flashy or obvious way. The cinematography takes some of the grungiest and grimiest environments you can imagine and makes them look incredibly detailed, dramatic and cinematic. The combination of artful camera angles, moody lighting and a hypnotic Hans Zimmer score makes the film a uniquely captivating experience. The movie gives us the greatest-looking Batman costume ever seen on film. The creepy all-black fetish look the character has been cursed with in live-action since Tim Burton's 1989 film is finally, mercifully gone. The movie's Batmobile displays the best combination of style and function seen yet in a Batman film. And the movie's Batman action scenes are hands-down, bar-none, the greatest Batman battles ever put on film.Ben Affleck overcomes all doubts in this movie to prove that he is as well-suited for the Batman role as anyone ever has been. With his square jaw and thick hair, he resembles the comic book and animated series Bruce Wayne better than anyone ever has. He brings an intensity to the role that is nicely tempered with a sense of sensitive humanity, crucial to keeping the character from going so far over the edge that he can't find his way back.The other actors make an impact as well. Henry Cavill continues to look like the picture of reserved strength. His quiet intensity makes the movie's most magnificent sequence work, a montage of Superman's feats of power set to a thoughtful narration ruminating on the meaning of superheroes. Amy Adams is a more believable and feminine Lois than she was in Man of Steel. Jesse Eisenberg makes for a young, devilish version of Lex Luthor who dominates his scenes with ingenious dialogue full of the zaniest mix of highbrow historical references and lowbrow pop culture references since Gene Wilder's in Willy Wonka. Holly Hunter, Jeremy Irons and Diane Lane provide absolutely expert, professional support while Gal Gadot makes a smashing debut as Wonder Woman exhibiting all the beauty and power anyone could've hoped for.Any discussion of the film has to address the mixed reaction it received from critics and audiences. As someone who loves the film, it's almost impossible for me to understand why someone would hate it. Looking back in history on films that were not well-received in their original release but eventually became regarded as classics, there seems to be a common thread. Willy Wonka was considered too scary and disturbing a fantasy for the young children it was aimed at. Blade Runner was considered too dark, violent and intellectual for audiences who were accustomed to seeing Harrison Ford in traditional action-adventures. Look at other films like It's a Wonderful Life, Citizen Kane, Fight Club, Heathers, Brazil, Shawshank Redemption, etc. The films that most often take years to achieve high recognition and cult status are most often films that deal with dark, depressing or dystopian subject matter. Very often these films are more popular overseas at first than they are in the U.S.A. All of these are patterns that seem to be evident with Batman V Superman. I firmly believe that, in time, BVS will be widely regarded as an absolute classic of the superhero genre. It will never be forgotten or lost to history. It will be a film that people who grew up on superhero films look to when they're older for a deeper, more thoughtful, more artistic exploration of the genre."
" Let me explain why this movie gets a bad rap....
",-0.5423,0.9898,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I'm gonna surpass the whole studio-producer differences and refer to this movie's ultimate edition that runs at 3 hours long. This review is long due but i feel like the time is right for me to put my opinion out there. Justice league snyder cut and all..
Someone took our beloved heroes and put them into this time and this era of humanity. How would the world see a man dressed as a bat fighting crime at the streets of the most criminally bent city? How would the world see a Jesus-God like character that falls from the sky and tries to do the right thing every day despite the fear that his powers send down the spine of people trembling because of their feeling of powerlessness? Alfred does mention it turns good men cruel. And he is right! All of this would be absolutely logical to happen if their were set at our world.
Bruce Wayne resembles the daily, ordinary man who fears the strong and acts irrationally. But the strong are not always bad.. Lex mentions that if God is all powerful, then he cannot be all good and vice versa.. Well he is right ! But in this case Superman is not a ""God"", but an alien raised as human, even more humane than ordinary man Bruce, trying to do the right thing.
As for the cast, complains usually form around Jesse. He did give an excellent performance as a mixture of what we would get if Joker had a baby with Alexander Luthor. But i would like to imagine that Leto and Eissenberg got mixed up when the actors were cast.
Onto Ben and Henry... the Batman that we know from the comics and the Supes that we would get in this new world came to life with these folks. And last but not least... Batman doesn't kill... But here we see what happens when man loses all things that he could hold on for a glimpse of light... And the same glimpse of light reemerging when ""God"" sacrifices for him to live.
Definitely my favourite comic book movie. 10/10 is just cause i am a fan, i admit it."
" Not too bad!

" Action packed, but story lacked
",0.0,0.9386,2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"Let me begin by saying, overall, not bad. A film about 2 of the staple men, Super and Bat, coming together to defeat Jeff Bezos from another dimension, Lex Luthor, and his Kryptonian brain child from hell, Doomsday. All with some help from the stunning Gal Gadot as Wonderwoman.As far as the acting goes, Ben Affleck as Batman gets a B-, he wasn't the worst to play Bruce, but still left some to be desired. Henry Cavill as Superman earns a solid B in this movie. Gal Gadot as Wonderman gets an A-. Lastly, the loved-to-be-hated Jesse Eisenberg gets a B as well because he still lacks the powerful nature that Luthor begs.Now the film, which was long by the way. I have to say the first hour of the movie was actually relatively good. The set up and development of each story line in the movie caught some steam headed in the right direction. Unfortunately, it began to run cinematic plays that were all to predictable and, at some points, lackluster. A turning point in the quality is when Batman and Superman fight, and Superman says Bruce's mom's name so he just freaks out and quits? From there you could guess the rest; they realize they have to work together, but it's not enough, then superwoman comes in and they're winning! But, shocker! A superhero has to make the ultimate sacrifice to direct a nuke away from New York into the heart of the beast in the atmosphere (cough, cough...the first Avengers movie). Oh no Superman is dead! Wait, he's alive! You get the point. The action was really intense though, so at least it still had the entertainment factor."

" Mixed feelings...
",0.0,-0.8668,2020-05-18 00:00:00,4,"It's been almost half a decade since this movie came out, yet I'm still not exactly sure about how i feel about it. Unlike most i don't hate this movie. People are calling this the worst DCEU movie, but it's significantly better than both Suicide Squad and Justice League. First of all I actually like the casting in this movie with one HUGE exception that I'll mention later on. Aflec is fine as the caped crusader and Cavil is great too. The fight scenes are honestly good here. Directing and cinematography is ok (maybe a bit too dark at times but I'll allow it). I liked the Batman vs Superman fight (minus.. you know) and the warehouse fight scene with Batman was legitimately great and the highlight of the movie. I also thoroughly enjoyed the scene where Bruce Wayne tries to save as many people as possible in the Metropolis fight scene from Man of Steel. Love the perspective and it shows why Batman dislikes Superman rather convincingly! Also love how we got to see Batman actually do some detective work this time round and Wonder Woman fit into the scene nicely. However, there a ton of bad stuff as well, with the worst one being the plot which is honestly awful. Nothing makes sense! Lex Luthors plan is insane! So he creates Doomsday by combining his DNA with Zods... WHAT? Why would he do that? Why did the ship let him do that despite it being stricly forbidden? And how did he know that Doomsday would be the result? Also, when Lex framed Sups for blowing up the building... like how did people believe that? You think Superman needs to use a bomb to kill everyone? And Batman decided to team up with Superman cause their moms have the same names... The fight could have also easily been resolved if Superman just... told Batman that Lex had his mother hostage and that he and Batman had the same goal. The movie expects you to suspend your disbelief to a point where you might be permanently damaged in order to make Lexs plan work. Speaking of Lex Luthor! Jesse is a great actor but the way he portrays Lex is awful! That character has NO resemblance whatsoever with the actual Lex, in fact he's significantly closer to the Joker than he is to Lex Luthor (closer than Leto at least). The ending fight was also another meh CGI mess and only served to lay the groundwork for Justice League (and we all know how that came out). Supermans death was almost as believable as Black Panthers when he fell off the waterfall, everyone with a brain knew he'd come back as soon as possible. Lois Lane is also... there. They even brought Jimmy Olsen! Ofcource this movie is DARK and SERIOUS so ofcource he instantly died. And lastly Batman killing people is a no no. Batman does not kill, like that's his ONE rule! You can't disregard that! I like the attempt to make him be a dark characters, as that's what he's supposed to be. But he doesn't have to brand and kill people to prove that. All in all this movie is fun and has nice aspects to it, but the flaws are overwhelming! This is a movie people have been wanting to see for decades, and it deserved to be better. 4/10 from me."

The cinematography is very very good (opening scene is like a poem, it is just amazing), script could be better but ok, acting is good, action scenes is what it should be in a batman superman mix, effects are nice, music score is 10 out of 10, overall a very nice movie indeed. Now come on, in how many batman movies you can watch him chain-gun down thugs, crush them with flying car and make them explode. I want to see this kind of dark knight more often. Batman really suits Affleck, I wish he didn't quit as the bat. Justice League is plain bad, but this is a really solid, well-crafted movie. Could it be better? Absolutely, there is no such thing as perfection. that is why I give it overall 8 out of 10."

Besides this, there are a few things that makes you feel like frustrated in different moments, examples like Batman' suit (excesive), the fight between the two heroes ( too long and bad ending) and obviously the fight that comes at the end against that monster ( that monster makes no sense). So i didn't like the heroes or the villans + the story. What can i say? It will be really difficult to DC equalize Christopher Nolan's Batman series.

Henry Cavill for me was well cast as Superman. This movie certainly wet my appetite for Batman vs Superman - even though I had my reservations about Ben Affleck taking on the role of the Dark Knight.I do prefer the darker side of DC over Marvel, but being darker isn't enough. You still need a good story that is well told. Is the story behind Batman vs Superman a good one? I think probably not... it's certainly not told well.The movie just felt like an increasingly angry, borderline incoherent noise fest optimised by Ben Affleck doing his level best to be an infinitely more angry and melancholy Batman than Christian Bale.For me this movie offered little genuine drama or excitement. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther was the about the only source of fun and palatable entertainment.It just didn't build on, or even maintain, the solid foundation set by Man of a Steel. Yes there were moments in the movie I enjoyed, but it was more Dawn of Rubbish than Dawn of Justice. Maybe they should have done a sequel to Man of Steel first? And focused on a new stand alone Batman movie before bringing these to DC superhero's together?I hope you enjoy the movie more than I did."

But Superman is just Superman, so that was alright.Besides that, there was not much of an intense or interesting plot, it all felt really bare. It was quite boring and nothing special.

You can. The movie is excellent until Batman is going to kill Superman, since then it becomes so pathetic in its predictable events to make me unsatisfied. The variation of my plot considers that Batman actually provides the Superman elimination because of Luthor's plan, but once he understands his evil idea and the severe aftermath, he tries to repair his mistake removing the spear from Superman body which he controls into a sarcophagus with minimal sign of life, so to fight Doomsday together Superman once he recovers his strength in order to sacrifice his life to save the world from the dangerous menace. Loise Lane character has really ruined the whole DC franchise in my opinion. As it is possible to see, she will be fundamental to calm a revived Clark Kent in the sequel.
What is wrong in my opinion: she acts as a Fate. She is already great as journalist, it is not necessary made her as Zeus. Another issue to note in each movie about Superman. Clark Kent has the face of Superman, no director has imagined he could change the color of his hair and eyes so to mask himself using his powers. So the viewer of this movie sees Batman able to recognize Diana Prince as Wonder Woman but unable to recognize superman as Clark Kent."

With an elite script (except for the too fancy Martha thing), with perfect acting, Nolanistic ""realism"", psychologically developed deep and real characters, metaphorical, philosophical and socially charged themes and story plots, and the often perfect visual spectacle typical of Zack Snyder (granted, only possible because of the budget).This is not a light movie, with characters with little to no motivations for doing what they do, except maybe the lazy ones ""my loved ones are in danger"" crap. There are jokes, but not to cut tension and not to transform all in a dumb comedy after all. And that's good. The rejection for this movie made it one of the last to approach this genre with any intention to comunicate something, emotional, philosophical, social. That makes it more unique.

Zack Snyder leaves multiple trials referencing further layers to this movie, such a Robin's graffitied suit, the appearance of Flash and the flash forward to an alternate future where Superman is bad. The beautiful alternate colours throughout this movie reflect the various moods and atmosphere and help highlight the various layers of this movie. It's complex nature and appearance of jumping around I understand may put the ratings down for this movie, but now as I appreciate and understand the 'layers' it makes me realise how wonderfully creative and respectful of the original Batman and Superman characters that have been written about in the DC comics over the years.

I went into this film not expecting what I was going to get and I got the opposite, for the bad and good.Zach Snyder made a decent film. He went a different way but managed to still visually amaze us. For the most part, I loved Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman. From the intro until the end, It was amazing. Gal Gadot was also great. The casting was good for the most part and Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL did great on the score.The bad, I felt that the storyline was random and rushed to introduce the Justice League. I didn't really enjoy Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He didn't feel too intimidating and was kind of weird. Also, Henry Cavill's Superman was good but dull and confusing.My favorite part was the fight between Batman and Superman because I just assumed Superman would just beat Batman (which almost happened), but Batman got ahold of some Kryptonite and turned the tables around against Superman.

" Dawn of Disappointment
",-0.5106,0.9339,2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"The reviews have been mostly bad, but I did not read any as the movie deserves a chance regardless of commentary. Sadness. This was a missed opportunity for everyone involved. My gripe is not with Zack Snyder, who did what he could with a pathetic script, nor even David S. Goyer who has proven to be a lesser writer without Jonathan Nolan as collaborator, but with the DC film executives. Too much was demanded from this movie and thus delivers very little.
It has been a decade since Christopher Nolan gave superhero films the authority to be edgy, dark, and serious, and somehow we got to the point that they now have license to be devoid of fun and basic storytelling aspects like plot, character development, and even reasonable logic for the things happening in the world on the big screen. What Sam Raimi, Joss Whedon, and the Russos fought so hard to cultivate, comics book movies as legitimate storytelling, was very much ruined in the span of ONE movie. Ironically comics themselves are just gaining this respect as a medium, a sad day for the genre.
Marvel was bold by taking a series of films in order to lead into their prize pig, The Avengers, while DC admitted to the world that their characters are incapable of rousing up enough interest minus their two big guns. Saddest of all is the needless ""versus"" aspect of the movie, because it is nonexistent. My excitement stemmed from a possible adaption of Frank Miller's visionary world of the ""Dark Knight Strike Returns"" or even the fun mash-up stories of Jeph Loeb. Instead we are treated to a run of the mill story that takes a page from the Michael Bay school of writing, blow everything up."
" Ignore the Hate!
",-0.7574,0.4762,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"While it is better than ""Man of Steel"" (but only slightly), this movie is not without problems of its own. The plot doesn't flow very well, and the film is a bit hard to follow as a consequence of that. I wasn't quite sure what the film was trying to be. And some of the characters' portrayals in this movie feel odd. Lex Luthor feels more like The Joker. However, the action sequences in this movie were impressive. Also, it knew just when to give us mindless action. and when to pause to give us plot. Another thing that made this stand out was they still tell Batman's origin story for those who may not be familiar with it, but it's done in 2 minutes over the opening credits. (Take notes, upcoming Marvel Spider-Man reboot. This is how you should tell the origin.) They also knew when to tease us just enough to get us hyped for the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe films. How, you may ask? No, spoilers. You'll have to see for yourself, but believe me, it's fanservice at its best. Overall, the film doesn't deliver much in terms of plot, but more than delivers on what fans really want to see: Mindless action scenes, and Batman and Superman fighting each other (with some teases for the fans to get them excited for the upcoming films)Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars"

A more complex film, but equally entertaining and as violent as one might expect for a battle of comic book proportions. Oddly, this edit didn't get an R rating. Mild sex scenes, explicit adult themes, and bloodless horror. Sometimes these movies explore more of the grey area of right/wrong as opposed to the harsh polar differences of good/evil. Adult fans are OK with that. But if you take your kids, I would suggest a discussion before and after, because the film has some really raw moments that show heroes doing questionable things, some cowardly things, dramatically ultra-violent things. This is a fantastic product for folks that grew-up loving superheroes. An eye-catching distraction for our times. I wish they would just make them R rated and really have at it thematically."

" Not A Masterpiece, But An Important Post Modern Commentary Nonetheless
",0.0137,-0.9927,2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Been meaning to talk more extensively about this one, because arguably the most divisive film of the decade deserves more than a few sentences.I'll start off by saying that Batman v. Superman is no masterpiece. This isn't a case like the Star Wars prequels or The Wolfman (2010) or even Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom where I will die on a hill in defense of it being one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. There are big problems I have with it.Eisenberg as Lex was an interesting experiment that I feel ultimately failed. I don't mind the more neurotic take on the character, but the script presents him as too unstable too fast. I feel the direction the film goes with Lex would only have worked as a slow descent into madness (which makes sense, given that Eisenberg's best acted scenes are near the end) It's hardly out of character for Lex to lose his mind on an increasingly obsessive quest to destroy Superman, but there doesn't seem to really be a journey with him as a villain.Doomsday isn't handled very well here either, which is shocking given that he's so easy to get right. His entire character revolves around him being the enemy of all life, the antithesis to the preserver of life that is Superman. That point doesn't get across very well when most of the death he causes is done in self defense or confusion. He lacks weight, he lacks menace and, worst of all, he's just not intimidating.Batman doesn't spare Superman because their mothers have the same name. I feel that's self evident at this point, but it's important to say. That's being said, the dreadful dialogue and awkward editing in that scene don't exactly paint a clear picture for Batman's motivations and definitely undermine some rich thematic material and really not-bad acting. Snyder had the right idea with Batman's redemption coming through a son pleading for his mother's life, but the execution is incredibly messy. Scenes like this are why I call Snyder an absent minded professor; he's an intelligent storyteller with smart ideas, but he lacks the wisdom and patience to execute them properly.Being a cinematic universe film doesn't do this film very many favors either. It's hard for me to take this entirely seriously for the art house masterpiece it's trying to be, exploring deep themes like xenophobia, cultural fear and media irresponsibility, when it's also trying to sell Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash films in a movie that has nothing to do with them.With all of that out of the way...This is still a good film.I'm tempted to say that this is the perfect take on the Superman character. Turning him into an allegory for the plight of the American refugee, the victim of horrific prejudice, intolerance and cultural hatred from a race he truly loves unconditionally, gives pathos, vulnerability and cultural relevance to the character that we haven't seen on film before. Cavill gives an outstanding performance as Clark Kent and I had no problem believing the increasingly heavy emotional burden he had to carry in his nuanced, detailed facial acting.On the other side, we have Affleck's Batman, easily the best performance of the character in live action. He's as intimidating, haunted and convincingly ruthless as any great supervillain and the more cruel and sinister take on the character is a fascinating departure from Bale's version of the character. This is what Batman would look like in the real world; a jaded, paranoid billionaire who spends a small fortune waging a futile war on crime sinking further and further into violent madness. Affleck's vulnerability and fragility keeps the character sympathetic without being truly empathetic, a tragic villain who only finds redemption when Superman shines a mirror on his bigoted, Right Wing jingoistic ways.The musical score is absolutely outstanding, arguably the most iconic since Elfman's scores of the early 90s. It's epic, sweeping and does a lot of the heavy lifting in translating the film to the modern myth that Snyder is obviously trying to hard to achieve. You Are My World is a particularly moving and emotionally evocative track and easily the most memorable here.While Batman v. Superman is far from perfect, Zack Snyder should still be proud of what he's accomplished in what's probably the best live action Batman film to date.

It Also has A really Realistic feel to it.Things I liked About this Movie:° It Had a Dark Overtone to it and Despite being a Super Hero Movie it felt Serious.° It Meshed The World of Eminent Super Heroes and The Real World Humans Excellently. From the Court Hearing to the Human Protest to the News Shows. The Population were Either demonizing Superman or giving him Adulation or Even Worshipping him, it was very very Clever.° The Concept of a Nearly Unstoppable Individual in Superman and A Fragile Human With Technology and High Intellect in Batman is Always an Intriguing Concept.° The Power Was Coursing Through My Veins when Batman Utters The Famous Quote 'TELL ME'. So so Powerful.° The Battle Between Batman Vs Superman Was So Good. I have got to say, Batman goes to town On Superman.° Batmans' Armoured Battle Suit Looked Great.Really Bad Points:° It Shoehorns characters into the Movie without having Patience and putting the Standalone work in first. We all know why, to try and Bring in the Justice League just like Marvel brought in the Avengers. Rushing things will not Work.° When the Big Monster comes into the Movie, i got tuned out. It was pretty much over at that point. It turned the focus off of what we came to see, which was the Animosity between Batman and Superman and how it would be resolved.° Lex Luthor is Not ment to be a Cross between the Riddler and the Joker.Overall, It was Brilliant.

" Average at best
",0.6369,0.9598,2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,"A ten year old could honestly write a better script. Ben Affleck is a terrific Batman and Zack Snyder and his writers failed him in this and in Justice League. But make no mistake, this is a much better film that JL. There are some scenes that are great and make me wish the film was consistently great. The ""Versus"" part, the fight alone begins epic but quickly dissolves and disappoints. I guess you can say these folks really don't care about fan pleasing because the fight is so short, I mean c'mom! Give the people what they want! An epic fight, not some warehouse brawl we get in every other action flick. It could have been infinitely better. Jesse Eisenberg was interesting. Not sure if that means good. We've never seen a Lex Luther quite like him that's for sure. The film just feels sloppy but somehow withholding on some awesome potential. Armored Batman is cool as hell! The dream sequence was bad ass! ""Do you bleed?"" Is an epic line. But what good is it when everything else doesn't match these epic scenes, am I supposed to sit through the bad parts to see the little bit of good? I suppose that's what YouTube is for. But Batman V Superman was a long awaited, epic event and just did not deliver. I left the theater feeling cheated but somehow a little confused because I did enjoy what actually worked. That being said, with so many films hitting the mark on everything, it's really no excuse."
" Kind of pathetic
",-0.5719,-0.8681,2020-03-20 00:00:00,3,"At least it left an impresion (unlike Justice League which is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry), but unfortunatelty is not a very good impression.It has some good ideas and performances, but the execution is poor and the writing doesn't make the actors any favors.There are so many things that WB clearly was too scared to follow up on after the film's critical failure. Like, what was up with that wierd Flash vision Bruce had? What does he mean with Lois Lane being the key? What will happen with Darkseid?I know its cheap to compare the DCEU to Marvel, but imagine if Marvel just decided to drop the whole infinity stones storyline because people didn't like The Dark World.
It's that lack of commitment that turned so many people away from this movies, and it all started here"

" An Attempt to Hurriedly Leap a Mound of Franchise Setup in a Single Bound?
",0.0,0.9847,2020-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Aside from a few aspects, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is an incoherent jumble of content.Firstly, I want to mention the strong positives of the movie, and to me, there are a hand count of five. One, the cinematography is stunning; much epic moments and fan-yearned character confrontations are composed with as much artistic aesthetic and sensibility as panels of a comic book. Two, and an opinion stemming from Batman being my favourite comics character, this movie has the greatest portrayal of Batman yet in live-action (voice modulation, suit quality, and gadgetry display) (not Batmobile though; best designed version is still 1989's ""Batman""). Two, the warehouse brawl scene is exhilarating and one of the movie's strongest moments; it's well choreographed, and epitomizes this awesomely grim and brutal depiction of Batman. Three, the confrontation and fight between Batman and Superman was equally exhilarating and well choreographed (but for a movie titled ""Batman v Superman"", I expected more screen time of it). And lastly, the movie's culminating final act with the historic live-action uniting of DC comics' trinity characters who then battle with Doomsday; a DC fan's dream finally realized. There; that's what I liked of the movie. Five things. Done. Now the negatives...The most obvious detriment of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is that Warner Bros. seemingly yearned for the same box office success as Disney with Marvel Studios, but didn't want to devote the same release time building instalments to earn it. Warner Bros. stuffed ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" with as many DC references and other character exposition deviating from the core plot so that they could hastily release a Justice League movie to follow and get an easy cash rain (and also, make the runtime of ""Batman v Superman"" unnecessarily long too; ensure enough room for such tedious stuffing). Typing this review in 2020 after the shameful 2017 ""Justice League"", Warner Bros. should be exactly that for both - ashamed. The narrative of ""Batman v Superman"" is a near incoherent mess of plot-lines with a focus on sequel baiting rather than a focus on depicting a concisely entertaining story. The worthwhile distance of the latter would've made ""Batman v Superman"" unforgettably incredible for generations; unfortunately it didn't satisfy the historic hype.Another notable aspect of the movie that taints it further for me, is its excessive product placement and celebrity cameos. It dilutes the escapism and suspension of disbelief of a fictitious world to instead be tethered seeing current real-world celebrities and television personalities discussing Batman and Superman as being controversial real people. It's pretentious and cringe-inducing of a storytelling method.To conclude this, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has intermittent elements that are enjoyably thrilling, and I covered the five of my opinion, but together they're not enough to invigorate the experience gotten from the movie as a whole from being a convoluted overabundance of deviating content baiting the audience to a sequel, rather than being a movie depicting a focused, individualized story. It's a matter of taking conscientious quality steps versus impatient greedy leaps."

" Great action terrible storyline
",0.25,-0.9192,2020-03-08 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed Man of Steel when it came out in 2013 and when it was announced that Batman V Superman was being made I was hoping for the same level of action and destruction with a decent storyline that would connect the two characters together and form the DCU Justice League movie franchise with this as it's introduction and while it did kind of meet these expectations the end result was just a little bit off making it not the best movie or introduction to these characters working together and not the best introduction for Wonder Woman's character.The movie tries way to hard to be cool and interesting with it's action and story and while yeah the action scene's when they actually start are cool and look visually stylish and impactful the story really let's it down with a ton of story plot holes that make it so the whole fight could of been avoided by just simply talking to each other but they never do because Batman just decides Superman has to die in a universe where he let's Joker live even after killing so many people and even Robin it's weak character building just to get them both to fight when in the comics they fight even when they have been allies for years.The movies story is made up of a ton of different storylines from the comics and a few animated movies all glued together to make one unrecognisable mess with way too may sub plots it would of been fine if they just focused on the actual Batman V Superman part but instead it crams in Lex Luther, Doomsday, Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, a state senator and a storyline about people being afraid of Superman there's just so much going on in the movie that by the time Batman and Superman do fight your mentally exhausted from trying to keep up with the story.Visually the movie looks amazing with great CGI and special effects the fight scenes are really fun to watch and are enjoyable but sadly it takes the movie forever to get to it.Casting is almost perfect everyone expect Jessie Isenburg as Lex Luther because he just isn't the right person to play a character who's main traits are Technological genius, business tycoon, evil villain and is calm and confident nothing against Jessie Isenburg but he's a comedy actor not a dramatic actor and his performance alone makes this movie hard to watch.I recommend watching this movie if your a fan of Superman, Batman and the DCU and the comics just don't expect the best interpretation of Batman V Superman because you will be let down."

No, of course notHowever, neither is it a sign of the end of civilization, it's a perfectly fine, fun superhero movie, with Affleck doing a great job as an aging Batman, a pretty cool story & believable reason why Batman would not trust Superman & vice versaYes the Martha thing is absurd & there had to be a better idea out there that would've given you both a fight between the 2 & a reconciliation but I don't know what that is and neither do most of the people complaining about Martha (which again, to be clear, was terrible)Still a movie that if you ignore that bit has many cool parts to it and is even better if you manage to get hold of the extended version, makes the scene on the desert I particular make a lot more sense"

As kind of a fan I could keep up a bit but it most be hard for some people to understand at all.
the recommended age is 11. I can not see a 11 year old understanding this movie. Yes i think they would like it but they would not understand.and second I did not like the fact that they made Batman look like a bad guy and superman look like the good guy. I mean yeah I understood that they were trying to show that batman were in a bad place and was not feeling god, more like depressed, but they did not have to make him a bad guy. EVERYBODY knows that batman doesn´t kill! right?I liked the fact that wonder woman had a part but i did not like how they made her part in the movie. It were just like they had like a crisis and HAD to put her in somehow. The end were very weird and I think that it all just went crazy and a little bit to much with all the stuff that happend.some good parts...
I would really say that all the heroes were played by good people who made the roles good and made the movie a little bit better.
I also liked the very end of the movie but i don´t really have an argument for it.so over all... I think this movie were very overrated and thay could have done a much better job with a lot of things..."

There are way too many a dream, back story and journalism sequences, which takes up over an hour to actually get to Batman V Superman.On a positive note, the introduction of Wonder Woman was worthwhile and probably the most likeable aspect of this film. Some of the action sequences were actually well orchestrated, just to be overshadowed by the aforementioned.

""Batman v Superman"" in my heart Is one of the most underrated superhero movies. In troubled times, people need to find consolation, so he created ""Superman"" and called him ""God"". Until the heyday, people began to question the ""God"" that he once respected, thinking that he would threaten himself, that is, non-my This kind of backward view still exists in people's minds. Different from Marvel's DC, it will discuss the topic of sharpness and depth. Although it has not reached the artistic level, he has worked hard. I hope people can see the wider superhero universe. It is not a pile of joke and joke. It is a cold style, a deep story, and heroes in need of redemption. Look at today 's DC Justice League 's huge Waterloo causing Warner to demand a change of style, including firing Zach Schneider's director who was successful and defeated, and Henry Cavill 's Superman and Ben Affleck 's Batman fled. Some people even say DC pills! But if you ask me why I prefer DC because he always surprises me, Nolan's Batman trilogy has become the ceiling of the superhero movie, and ""The Watchman"" shows us the hero Redemption, in this era of ""political correctness"", ""Wonder Woman"" better shows the charm of female superhero movies, and ""Neptune"" has made the extreme of popcorn cool films, even "" The Joker brought the superhero movie to the podium in Venice, opened up the DC dark universe, and saw the future of Robert Pattinson's Batman coming back.

" If only more super-hero movies could be like this one
",0.3612,0.9938,2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Batman v Superman is the proof that Zack Snyder does comic book adaptations like no one else. From 300 to Watchmen, movies that are very faithful to its source material, and then Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, both inspired by DC's classic stories, but at the same time provides a new look at those iconic characters. BvS is an uncoventional super-hero movie, it is 3 hours long (the Ultimate Edtion, and the only one that counts), and the first half of the movie is kinda slow-burning, and the final half is just megalomaniac, the most Zack Snyder thing Zack Snyder ever done, as good as the final fight sequence between Superman and Zod in Man of Steel. Snyder, Goyer and Terrio also did a great job in making a sequel to Man of Steel, even with the presence of Batman and Wonder Woman, the theme of how Superman would affect us, putting him in the real world, is continued and developed, and we see a conflicted Superman again.Unfortunetely, this movie is so misunderstood. The themes of hope, fear, power and sacrifice present here are powerful and it's why this movie is so special, at least in the super-hero subgenre, where the majority of the movies have this cartoonish look, while this movie is a mature work, like Watchmen, The Dark Knight and Logan. Here we have a Superm dealing with criticism and fear. People fear his powers, what he can do, and because of that he loses confidence, seeing Superman dealing with that is one of the high points of the movie. We also have the 'controversial' Batman, one of the high points of the movie as well. Zack Snyder's vision for the character is great, his arc is phenomenal. This is an older Batman, embittered, as seen in The Dark Knight Returns of Frank Miller, filled with rage and fearing what Superman could do, he feels powerless, in his nightmares he is haunted by the world engine sound, he has PTSD. His redemption arc is great. He went from ""20 years in Gotham Alfred, we've seen what promises are worth, how many good guys are left? How many stay that way."" to ""Men are still good, we fight, we kill, we betray one another, but we can rebuild we can do better, we will. We have to."" And then there is Lex Luthor, who is also controversial, many didn't like this version of the character, but I think this is the best version so far in film. Gene Hackman version can be summed up as a rich guy with a thing for real estate, but here we have a Lex Luthor with a more convicing motivation, that touchs Epicurean Paradox, he seeing Superman as the reflection of his own insecurities, but Luthor hates Superman mainly because he is the embodiment of power. There is so many more great aspects about this movie, the cinematography, the costume design, Batman have a badass and comic accurate suit, as well as Wonder Woman, the incredible coreography, principally in the one shot fight sequence in Batman's Knightmare, the magnificent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, and so on.BvS is amazingly well done, the mature tone and themes, terrific character arcs, stunning megalomaniac fight sequences and a great cinematography make this movie one of the best of the superhero subgenre."

The movie was cringy at times and Superman really is the only good character in this whole movie, along with Wonder Woman's limited appearances. I do not recommend spending your time watching this."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.9094,2019-12-25 00:00:00,5,"Because it is made with a very large and prestigious production company the production value isn't very good. That is the only good thing about this movie. The story is confusing, drawn out, and is downright terrible. The only good Actor is Henry Cavill. The other actors were not cast properly or are not up to par for the scale of this movie. If you're going to watch it watch the extended director's cut version because it has some extra scenes that make the story less confusing."

Having flopped as a superhero in 'Daredevil', Ben Affleck returns as a superhero - this time as Batman.The film has amazing visuals, but is also CGI heavy. The fight scenes are maybe overlong and overdone, yet still exciting. Its incredible that, in a 3-hour movie, there never was a dull moment. What a massive undertaking this film must have been. It is a non-stop display of action and CGI. The ending was a bit too much CGI, making it hard to conceive as realistic. The final hour literally is just one very long fight sequence. The film playes like a real-life cartoon. With so much happening in one film, I wonder if I will actually remember everything that happened. Maybe they should have streamlined the film a bit.If you're looking for action and CGI in abundance, then 'Batman v Superman' is for you. If not, well, then you might want to give this one a skip..."

" Simply EPIC!
",0.0,-0.9868,2019-12-19 00:00:00,10,"I've got no Idea how anyone can consider this anything other than extraordinary. They got the casting right, they got the story right, they got the Batsuit right, and most importantly they got Batman right. Affleck plays both Bruce and Batman perfectly. He truly captured the anger and brutality of Batman, which has never been so perfectly, or even close. Batman is one scary effin brute in this version. He is the Batman I'd least like to get my ass kicked by. Not taking away from Bale/Nolan films which are absolutely brilliant, yet they don't give us, the fans, the Batman we truly know and deserve. The damn warehouse scene IS BATMAN. One of my favorite scenes in any movie EVER. Of course he can take out a couple dozen armed guys...he's BATMAN. That's what he does. Bale was never shown to use any martial arts fighting techniques unless it was dropping a smoke bomb and escape like a ninja, and he didn't really incorporate his gadgets into his fighting style (which the Arkham video games did do well). Again it was a nod to let the fans know they want to give us what we want to see...Arkham style fight scenes. I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy, although now when I watch any of them, I just don't think that version of Bruce/Batman is all that great...he never really was. It seems I thought he was, until Affleck did it to perfection. The ridiculous fight scenes in Dark Knight, are just camera cutaways and blurred images that only tell us that Batman is probably winning. Other than the Bane fight they're all like this. Affleck is right out in full view, knocking dudes out, breaking bones, throwing dudes through walls...just being an angry brute, blocking bullets and knives, taking on multiple guys with a fair amount of ease. He looks so enraged and brutal, yet looks so much more polished, trained, experienced, and dangerous. And yes I know ""he killed people""...but didn't Keaton kill... c'mon! Dropping bombs on the bad guys feet when they're at his Batmobile, a ticking time bomb he cuts off of a clown then attaches it to the clown and throws it into a manhole. He killed Joker as well. Nobody bitched about that.Ask yourself this...if you had to bet on it, who would win in a fight, Affleck's Batman or Bale's Batman?"
" Underwhelming
",0.0,0.8538,2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"I had high hopes for Batman v Superman, I loved Man of Steel, and the some of the trailers were really good. Unfortunately the movie was far too long, the story was convoluted, Lex Luthor was horribly miscast, and there were far too many scenes that served no purpose. There are some positives though, Ben Affleck is good as Batman ( which was a concern since he was cast), there's some cool action scenes ( the warehouse scene in particular), and some of the story problems were fixed in the Ultimate Cut. Overall it's not the worst movie, but it should've been better."
" Good build up, but weak execution.
",-0.4404,0.9829,2019-12-11 00:00:00,5,"The story's a bit convoluted. And the pacing is quite off. I really really want this movie to be good. It's not. It's just an okay movie. Maybe it's the hype, I'm not sure. I really hope this movie is like Watchmen, where only the Director's cut can do it justice (Yup, I went there).The core of the character is not the definitive one (or rather, not the most liked by people). Batman kills people, Superman still having doubts about being Superman (I can understand it in Man of Steel, but not in this movie where I HOPED that he would be a more optimistic Superman [again, sorry for the pun]) and a very weird Lex Luthor. Don't get me wrong, if Jesse Eisenberg was playing another villain (ex: the Riddler or anybody who's a psychopath) it would be perfect. But Lex Luthor never really shows that side of him, much. The definitive Lex Luthor for me is like a real mastermind, the one who wouldn't be so obviously the villain and usually gets away with crime even when people knew he was behind it. A good example to describe him is he's like a politician (hence why he became USA president at one point). Never gets his hands dirty, and almost always had a fall guy. This movie definitely doesn't show that even at the very least. (Mind you, I have never see any actor pulled the definitive Lex Luthor, in my opinion).There's definitely some good things from the movie. Alfred was phenomenal. Jeremy Irons might be my favorite Alfred ever. And I hope that this Alfred is Batman's Earth-One Alfred (read it, a fine comic). Wonder Woman definitely stood out in that last action sequence. But in terms of if she can pull off Wonder Woman herself is a judgment that I will reserve until her solo movie, since we saw very little of her. The easter eggs in this movie is definitely one that I welcome with open arms. Injustice, Darkseid, and Flashpoint does give us plenty to ponder over the next slade of movies.Other than that, I'm quite okay with this movie (emphasis on JUST OKAY). This COULD HAVE BEEN the definitive comic book movie. But it's not, in my opinion. (I actually was never a fan of Marvel movies formula that much). My anticipation for the Justice League is toned down from ""cautiously optimistic"" to ""cautiously pessimistic"". Now, I'm secretly hoping for a George Miller or even a Ben Affleck DC directed movie. Let's hope Zack Snyder can do another Watchmen, but this time a movie that doesn't need to redeem itself in the Director's cut version."

Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

Many things happen in the 1st hour of the film that do not really represent any interest in the way that they are shown. I do not understands this moments when the Bat has nightmares/hallucinations/delirious dreams, they have no point, it is like they are trying filling movie time(""so much"").

" More enjoyable than I was expecting
",0.4927,-0.6931,2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Plot
Eighteen months after Superman battled Zod, Batman is convinced that Superman himself is a potential threat and needs to be stopped. Meanwhile, Clark Kent wants to unmask Batman the Vigilante.What I Liked
The original premise seemed silly, until you see both Batman and Superman fearing what the other might do, and seeing themselves as the saviour. Diana Prince does a great job managing around the two testerone-filled superheroes. And it is great to finally see a real villain that poses an actual threat -- Doomsday is so powerful, he can even kill Superman, and it takes all three of the heroes together to stop him and Lex Luthor.What I Didn't Like
Lex seems more like a cliché, and using adoptive mothers as extortionary bait seems contrived."

" Thank you Ultimate Edition
",0.3612,0.9931,2019-11-27 00:00:00,8,"Alright I was not a very big fan of the theatrical (disconnected scenes) cut, but this version made me love this movie. It's still isn't perfect and I'll get to that later, but once I start this movie I don't want it to stop it till it is done. Great performances (for the most part), great scenes, lines of dialogue, and characters. It is also one of those films that I like more and more every time I watch it or learn more about it.The things I like about this movie:
Scary batman that looks amazing with a strong motivation. Also I don't mind that he kills people in this version. He is a weathered, tired, no kind of person who sees criminals as weeds.The action sequences are great. In particular, the warehouse fight scene. One of the best batman scenes ever put to film. The fight between batman and superman is really good although I do wish it was a bit longer.Strong story to get invested in. thank god.I really like Henry Cavill's superman and I was never a big superman fan but man of steel and this film changed my mind.Thing's I did not like:
Doomsday. They should have used him later in a third superman film or something. This is my major flaw with the movie. It should have been batman and superman fighting lex Luthor in that mech suit that is in all the video games.Jesse Eisenberg. I don't hate Eisenberg in this role but if wb announced that someone else would be playing lex. I wouldn't have a problem with it.While I like the Africa sequence, it would flowed better if they just went from the destruction of metropolis to superman and the political stuff.Overall though. great film. Even the martha scene grew on me. If you saw the theatrical cut and didn't care for it the first time, you should watch the ultimate cut. maybe keep rewatching it cause like I said. you pick up things the more you see it. 8/10"

" A Great Beginning to Greatness for real DC fans
",0.6249,0.8422,2019-11-18 00:00:00,10,"Snyder's version of today's superhero movies is realistic. Marvel has their own versions of superhero movies that works for them. To compare the 2 comic book companies by making the same type movie is insane. Snyder made DC better. With no restrictions on hiding behind the disney logo, Snyder was able to make a more realistic Comic book movie. Snyder had something great in building a new fresh version of DC that would stand out in story telling, BUT the WB screwed with his work by taking out parts of BvsS that added to the movie. I highly suggest watching the extended version to see what WB took out that added to BvsS. Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jeremy Irons, & even Jesse Isenberg are great casting for the characters they played. The introduction of KG Beast in the movie would have loved to see Snyder version expanded on. Also, since Snyder released that Martian Manhunter was in the movie as the General, good grief WB, you screwed us all over. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"

The story-line didn't make sense and I didn't understand the motives of Superman being against Batman.But then I watched the extended version and suddenly everything changed. The story-line made more sense, there were elements that we weren't presented in the cinematic version and all in all I think it saved the movie.I will still downvote the cinematic version  but to those of you who are considering watching the extended version, do it and do so with an open mind.Having these past couple of years putting this movie to rest in my head I was able to watch it with a new set of eyes.

The visuals/special effects are excellent, its action packed and has numerous great actors in it. I liked the beginning and middle. Flashbacks, rescues, differing philosophies about what kind of heroism is needed to protect the world, Lex Luther begins his reign.The actual battle between Superman and Batman which the movie spends ages working up to is anticlimactic, coming to an abrupt end when they realize their mums have the same first name and they should be friends and work together. Huh really! The final battle with some giant kryptonite creature was also pretty dumb.For some reason Wonderwoman shows up to help and there is a cameo from Aquamnan who I kept expecting to return at the end but guess Mamoa was busy. I struggled with Jesse Eisenberg as Luther, he just didn't work. Regarding the ending...I didn't see that coming."

The actual fight between the two was very short and while entertaining it weird to think that in Man of Steel Superman was fight another power person and punching each other into buildings, but here Batman is hitting Superman with a sink. And the way the fight ended was really stupid. And the final act with Doomsday was too much. If you want to watch Batman it's a good movie but it is a mess.5.0/10"
" Great actors are miscast. Incredibly complicated, tedious story. Too little action.
",0.6249,0.9571,2019-11-08 00:00:00,4,"I recently saw the original Superman movie from the eighties. Silly and outdated in parts, yet still very funny at moments and generally speaking still quite entertaining. Why not give the new Superman franchise a try, was my thinking.The good: first looks were impressive, because the photography and action looked stunning. It has got numerous great actors in it, whom I all like very much (in other movies), BUT these very same good actors are terribly miscast.The bad: Ben Aflleck is not believable in his role. Neither is Jesse Eisenberg or anyone else. It's just one long disappointing miscast of characters. Really annoying to watch these great actors make a fool out of themselves. A better casting could have delivered a much better picture. But there is more troublesome with this picture.The most troublesome thing about this movie is the incredibly complicated story, which lasts over 3 hours! (2.5 hours for the theatrical version). I saw the 3 hour version. I cant imagine anyone not getting bored at certain moments. And I guarantee you that you will NOT understand the plot. Is there enough action at least to compensate for the messy, complicated story? No, there is way too little action. The few action scenes are good though, but they consist of mostly CGI explosions and I honestly get bored by those CGI explosions after a while. Seen it all before.I need drama and believable characters in a good story first. And they are all missing big time! Anyone expecting a similar quality like The Dark Knight Trilogy or the original Superman better skip this movie..."

The movie was an interesting take and the second part of the DCEU (Dc Comics Extended Universe) the story takes place after the film Man of Steel, the film has an darker take on Batman who is this version is an older and a bit more broken version of the bat. Superman is struggling with the aftermath of the events of man of steel, and they also introduce a younger version of Lex Luthor (which is more accurate to a younger comic version) and Wonder Woman who is a wonderful addition.

" A slow burning story, with an amazing villain and right mix between fights and dialogues
",-0.3612,0.9741,2019-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Batman V. Super is a movie that either you like or don't. The slow burning story that tells how Batman and Superman become enemies is very interesting, and different from the average superhero movie. I personally like the Jesse Eisenberg interpretation as Lex Luthor, I am a huge fan of his work since ""The Social Network"".The movie is very well balanced, there is the right amount of dialogues and fight scenes, and beside some issues especially close to the end (I am referring to the famous Martha thing, who watched the movie, knows what I am talking about), it is very entertaining and I did not got bored, even if the film was three hours long. Compared to Man of Steel, this was a huge step forward for Snyder. There are still some big CGI sequences, but at least this time he made more stunts and practical action scenes, exactly what I expect for movie of this kind.Regarding the story itself, I have to say that opens a lot of opportunities for future movies. Batman V. Superman, at least for me is the real key to create an interesting narrative universe, and DC is taking the right path. I really hope that one day, they can reach the same quality of the MCU."

BvS is the movie that shows two of DC greatest heroes in their lowest point.

" Snyder's true vision is an epic slow-burn thriller that pits two incompatible philosophies of fear and hope against a backdrop of plausible real-world political dynamics
",0.7184,-0.9981,2019-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Zack Snyder is an incredibly divisive filmmaker, having outputs such as 300 and Watchmen. The idea that his films are an acquired taste is very much true. Watchmen, a film adaption of the graphic novel of the same name, continues to be debated for its unnecessary length and lack of emotional drama, unlike its source which is universally considered one of the greatest works in the medium. Visually, Snyder is lauded for his stylized action and violence but criticized for poor narrative. Expectations of Batman and Superman meeting for the first time in cinema are stupidly difficult to realize, but mostly the two heroes are expected to be friendly and cordial, not cutthroat. Studio interference also led to negative receptions of the incoherent theatrical cut. Ben Affleck as a grizzled batman caused further controversy because it gives less room for future Batman stories and his characterization as a jaded crime fighter, breaking his famous no-kill rule. Man of Steel is just as divisive as his other films. Nevertheless, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition, Snyder's true vision, is an epic slow-burn thriller that pits two incompatible philosophies of fear and hope against a backdrop of plausible real-world political dynamics. The Ultimate Edition is what Warner Bros. should have released and Watchmen been.Batman v Superman stars Ben Affleck as Batman, a 20-year crime-fighting veteran who realizes his decades work in Gotham hangs in the balance when Superman, an alien with literal superpowers, becomes the figure of hope and peace, putting his immense physical abilities for humanity's greater good. Superman, played by Henry Cavill, lives normally in his true self as Clark Kent, a Daily Planet news reporter. Two years after his destructive battle with fellow Kryptonian General Zod in Metropolis, Superman has to grapple with a skeptical public divided between people who view him as an ordinary man who does good acts and those that treat him as a rogue figure, unbounded by law.The plot follows alternatively between both characters including Lex Luthor and Lois Lane. Batman is secretly doing detective work to locate a hidden figure who plans to bring a dirty bomb to Gotham. Following an ambush in a war-torn part of Africa, Superman finds himself at controversy when he is wrongly accused of the resulting deaths. Lois Lane, Clark Kent's partner, has to uncover the truth behind the ambush. Lex Luthor, a wealthy industrialist, openly influences Sen. June Finch to allow access inside the crashed Kryptonian ship and importation of a xenomaterial, capable of weakening Kryptonian physiology. The two main characters view each other on opposite lenses. Batman sees Superman as a threat who must be eliminated, while Superman views Batman as a lawless vigilante who decides unilaterally who lives or dies. Batman is the embodiment of fear, while Superman is the personification of hope.Ben Affleck nails the grumpy attitude of the character in the comic book miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, including the physicality. Unlike previous versions, this Batman is a hulking behemoth who prefers to overpower foes instead of using agility. Similar to the Burton films, Batman is willing to kill and does so in significant numbers. Taking liberties and deviations can often lead to poor characterization, but not in this. His willingness to kill is given proper motivation, thus as executed in the story Batman's characterization works. Henry Cavill is much improved from his first outing as Superman in Man of Steel. None of the forced emotions and bad delivery of lines such as ""You're a monster Zod..."" Cavill convincingly plays the inner conflict of doing good, while getting flacked. Differentiating himself from Christopher Reeve, this Superman doesn't have the traditional boy scout persona commonly found in the comics and is more contemplative, even brooding. In the theatrical cut, Cavill looks bad because a majority of the 30-min deleted scenes were his as Clark Kent doing investigative journalistic work about Batman's recent violent outings. Reinserting those scenes in the Ultimate Edition gives the character more humanity, thus better overall acting. Amy Adams, like Cavill, is given more material in the Ultimate Edition. The biggest and most criticized acting decision is of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Fans expect Luthor to be gentlemanly and smooth, not manic. Eisenberg is another casualty of the theatrical cut that makes his performance and role look bad. Luthor has additional scenes in the Ultimate Edition that give him proper motivation, unlike in the theatrical cut where he comes off truly insane. The additional 30-minutes gives everyone more breathing room that enhances the acting.As a political thriller, Batman v Superman digs deep into deconstructing the characters to their basics. Driven by the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne crusades as Batman to fight crime, a motivation consistently referenced throughout the film. 20 years as Batman, accompanied by the death of Robin, drags Bruce Wayne to mental lows, losing his humanity and empathy, further motivated by a sense of hopelessness and failure. Events unfold that reveals his detective work was a ruse to locate Kryptonite, a xenomineral capable of killing Superman. Unlike Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent does not have the same family tragedy and still has his mother to lean on. A figure with god-like powers, Superman ushers in political debates as to the necessity of his existence and whether he should be confined to government-sanctioned actions. Someone with such powers will court controversy, regardless of intentions. Superman is also shown to be more human and grounded than Batman. Lex Luthor manipulates both characters' inherent antagonism by blowing up Capitol Hill, abducting Martha Kent, building hatred for Superman through affected Wayne employees and importing Kryptonite which he intended for Batman to use against Superman. After an epic match, and before he could kill Superman, Batman finds his lost humanity when Superman says his mother's name, the same name of Batman's mother Martha Wayne. Two formerly opposite characters cast their differences to fight a common threat. Batman v Superman also introduces Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot, and the concept of metahumans.Superhero films are big on spectacle and action. Snyder delivers the best fighting sequences in the genre. The Batman and Superman fight is brutal. Superman isn't depowered to make him a fair adversary. Batman is a tank, taking on armed goons singlehandedly. Wonder Woman is electric, taking center stage in the final fight against Doomsday. Doomsday is a Frankenstein monster with nearly limitless powers. The presentation of each hero and villain does justice to the characters. Batman v Superman is criticized for its bleak and dour tone, but for the film's subject material it is the appropriate direction. Even if the colors are greatly saturated, the film remains a beauty to look at. The cinematography, visual effects, production design, and score are all fantastic. Snyder is at the top of his artistic career.A genuine critic that can be leveled against this film is it undoes Superman's death by implying he may be alive. Building all that drama only to discard the payoff is not a good cliffhanger. Elements of his boy scout persona should have been presented in the beginning and then gradually becoming more emotionally distant. Superman is the beacon of hope and comics' greatest superhero, and despite the film's strengths narratively this version feels a bit distant. Overall, the film is still widely epic. Warner Bros. should be ashamed of butchering a great, elseworlds tale.9/10"
" Disappointing.
",-0.4939,-0.895,2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"This movie could have been so much better. The only redeeming element for me is the fact that Batman fought Superman. The narration is terrible, it's really quite boring, and Ben affleck was so much worse than Bale. A disappointment compared to the dark knight trilogy."
" This ""film"" is a perfect example of jumbled and rushed!
",0.6114,0.9707,2019-10-06 00:00:00,4,"""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), this is, without a doubt, one of the most lazy, overcomplicated and dysfunctional movies I have ever seen. After the failure known as ""Man of Steel"" (2013), we didn't think it could possibly get any worse, but it did! The story is nothing but jumbled subplots, most of the acting is subpar, and the sets/locations are dull. Where in the world do I begin with explaining what's wrong with the story? Zack Snyder's films are infamously known for being littered with unnecessary subplots and this ""movie"" is by far the best example of that. This ""movie"" tried to do what Marvel studios did with multiple films, by cramming several storylines into one movie. To be fair, in some films that can work. But in this ""film"", it just leaves it jumbled and confusing. They could have made at least five individual movies based on the storyline concept of this ""movie"" that would have been good individual movies on their own! Why did they squeeze all of these plot lines into one ""film""?! And to think, there's an extended version of this ""movie"". As if two and a half hours wasn't long enough! The reason why Marvel films work so much better is due to one crucial element; character development. Where every hero had their own solo movie to establish their character. Of course, you can have a second character in one of those films, like how Black Widow appeared in ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), and Hawkeye appeared in ""Thor"" (2011). They were on the right track about having both Batman and Superman together, that would have been more than enough. But in this ""movie"", you see cameos of all the other Justice League characters in a cheap and lazy way which contributes nothing to this ""film"". They think that cameos of other heroes count, it doesn't! That is definitely one of the laziest decisions that I've ever seen in any movie. That just goes to show how desperate DC is to competing with Marvel as far as movies go nowadays. As far as acting goes, it's just as bland and lackluster overall like in ""Man of Steel"". But one actor I must point out that totally ruined this ""movie"", what little there was to ruin, was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. That is, without a doubt, one of the top 10 worst casting decisions I've ever seen in any movie. Believe me, I'm not the only one who hates him in this role, trust me! However, I don't hate Jesse Eisenberg as an actor overall, he has acted well in other films. But his performance in this ""movie"" makes me cringe just thinking about it! I think that Jesse Eisenberg would have been better off playing either the Riddler or even the Joker! The best word to describe his portrayal of Lex Luthor is: awkward. Plain and simple! Another dull performance comes from Ben Affleck as Batman. Which is yet another wasted opportunity, because other than this ""film"", Ben Affleck is a great actor! But every time he speaks in this ""movie"", he sounds like he's extremely bored and even acts like he'd rather be in a different movie. Who could blame him? Also, the top of his bat suit is one of the laziest designs I've seen. The costume from the neck down isn't too bad, but those ears on top of the mask head are way too short and look like cat ears. His superhero name is Batman, not Cat-Man! Also, in the comics and other films, Batman/Bruce Wayne does not have facial hair. What? He couldn't be bothered to shave? Overall, the acting is just terrible! Also, all of the sets/locations are dull and boring. That's another common thing with modern DC films, everything is either dark, dull, or lacking bold colors. Did none of the writers read a comic book?! The only good things I can salvage from this ""movie"" are the special effects and the soundtrack. The special effects were well put together, and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was well composed. But those elements sadly could not have possibly saved this steaming pile of garbage. ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is yet another dull, boring and unpleasant viewing experience in the sorry lineup of modern live action DC films. I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale. This ""movie"" is, by far, the worst DC movie that was made after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. There's no way it could possibly get worse!"

" Watched This to Compare This With ""World's Finest"" Crossover.
",0.0,-0.9511,2019-10-03 00:00:00,5,"I wasn't sure about watching this sinse I have seen World's Finest, the Batman Superman cartoon crossover back when I was watching Toonami as a kid. Only really wanted to watch this as a compare and contrast between the cartoon crossover and this live action movie.I was a bit disinterested since these live action DC films now get attacked for being too dark and unpleasant. Just feels like these movies don't know want they want to be is all. This movie starts out with young Bruce Wayne watching his parents killed like in the original origin of Batman. He's played by Ben Affleck, though I have nothing against him but Hollywood says he's kind of a jerk but correct me if I'm wrong, since I'm not sure. The movie then shows Bruce Wayne in Metropolis during the big fight between Superman and Zod from the last Superman movie, Man of Steel. Bruce loses some people from his company in the crossfire between Superman and Zod and this somehow makes Bruce hate Superman.Then the movie goes on with Superman story where Lois Lane goes to some African nation and Superman ends up saving her from getting killed. Also where someone finds kryptonite, a mineral that can kill Superman, somewhere in the ocean. After that there becomes this elaborate plot to try to frame Superman for murder or something like that and it starts with the African nation. This part of the movie felt a bit too intricate is all. Also Lex Luthor is played by someone else that looks like he could be his son and he just feels like the Joker but if he was a redhead. Also kind of felt like Lex in this movie has no reason to hate Superman since after Man of Steel, Lex rebuild most of Metropolis.Along the way Wonder Woman makes a cameo which is a bit out of place since this is supposed to be Batman vs Superman and not Batman versus Superman vs Wonder Woman. Though along the way Batman gets a vision of what might be the future or if the Injustice video game became a movie. Basically where Superman man conquers the world after losing Lois Lane and the Flash's future self tells Batman to create the Justice League to stop that future.After Lex Luthor, takes Superman's mother hostage, he tries to get Batman for help but they end up fighting a bit until Superman mentions his mother's name and Batman has a change of heart since it was her mother's name too. Then Lex Luthor somehow makes Doomsday out of Zod's DNA and from his, and this Doomsday doesn't feel quite right since in the comics he was supposed to be this super powerful alien. Also he didn't look like him and just his big grey monster and didn't have all these spikes on him. Though there is this scene or after he's nuked he sheds his skin but that's about it. Then Doomsday somehow can fly and get laser vision even though I didn't think that was how he was he was just supposed to be this big Powerhouse of strength.After the big fight somehow Doomsday and Superman get killed but it feels like we barely knew Superman when this happens, also he ends up coming back in Justice League as well anyway. At the end Batman emails, the Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg, to put together the Justice League.This movie felt okay but I already knew that feeling how these movies have been going now. In the end it just kind of feels like now Hollywood is choosing and doing more of this style over substance with movies. Also feels like they are overpaying for the effects and actors instead of having a good story or good writing. There's this Ultimate Edition of the movie with more scenes to explain things but it might be a way just for people to buy the DVD or Blu-Ray instead. I feel like if you want to see a better Batman vs Superman crossover, just see Worlds Finest. I might even do a review about THAT then this movie."

",0.0,-0.9946,2019-09-29 00:00:00,1,"RANT - Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. I have ranted this movie last year I revivewd this movie twice, since I am making a Batman marathon why not review this garbage again. I am not going to watch this movie again. I don't care because I don't have this movie in my collection. Zack Snyder is an idiot. This movie comes not near ""The Dark Knight trilogy."" Joker (2019) is going to suck this year I am not interested to seeing it.Batman in this movie did do nothing for me. I hate his costum Ben Affleck is not Batman he just not acts like Batman. Horendeus costum who designed his custom? He and George Clooney are the worst Batmans of all time. I hate them. Batman in this movie acts like a criminal. He steals from Lex Luthor, yet he promise that he will kill Superman. He says do you bleed? Horrendous lines. I hate his lines I hate them.About Superman was terrible who had a sour puss face, said insipid lines like he was a sad sack character (the bat is dead, there never was a superman), and it was a 100% insult to the character. Christopher Reeve would be shocked, insulted, and angry.Nothing about this Superman instills hope or anything of the TRUE character of SUPERMAN.It was too long and way too boring. Nothing happened for at least an hour. It had awkwardly edited in dream sequences. Batman in this movie kills people in the dream sequence Superman uses his laser visions.Wonder Woman didn't need to be in this movie.They tried to fit in 10 different storylines (man of steel 2, dark knight returns, death of superman, Justice League prequel) and none had air to breathe.The title fight scene was only 5 minutes long and it was lame...it was a few punches, hitting supes in a skylight, hitting him with a sink, and supes grabbing batman's leg and throwing him. That's it.It had so much stupidity (Martha...after almost 2 years of hating the guy, he immediately stops just because their mom shares the same name? that was quick...why is one of Batman's traps against Superman 'Gatling Guns' aka Bullet? It's ruining Superman aka The MAN OF STEEL).Jesse Eisenberg was horrendous.The makers didn't care about the comics as much as they think (they kill Jimmy Olsen in cold blood and no one noticed/mentioned it...Supes apparently is pretty dumb or has no X-Ray Vision because there are half a dozen sequences where that would have helped), useless subplots (Lois and the 'bullets' stuff), in one scene the movie stops to give teaser trailers to 3 other upcoming super hero flicks, the end fight has Batman doing nothing against Doomsday and Superman barely doing anything...it's mainly Wonder Woman doing the fight...and it's based on SUPERMAN'S storyline!More stupidity (why didn't Superman just have Batman & Wonder Woman throw the spear of kryptonite, since it would kill/hurt him? Wonder Woman has super strength...Batman was doing nothing else,and there was time to do so. Just So Damn Dumb).And much, much more...Superman and Batman only have two scenes together and it's called Batman V. Superman...a 1 minute scene that you saw all in the trailer (the do you bleed scene) and when they fight...that's it.I hate this film I hate it."
" The most under-rated superhero movie of all time.
",0.0,0.8184,2019-09-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie was so fucking perfect that I don't even understand why people didn't like it.
First of all, the dark tone of this movie perfectly resonates with the darkness that's part of DC universe amd that's what makes it fascinating.
Secondly, the Batman vs Superman fight is just too good. Batman saving Martha, just because of her name wasn't an illogical thing either. He became batman due to the trauma of his parents death. So, it made perfect sense that he even her name would've such an effect on him.
The knightmare sequence is one of my favourites. And I really wanted that to happen post darkseid.
The character of lex luthor could've been a bit better, in matters of appearance, but he totally nailed his acting too.
If you just watched the theatrical version of this movie, I'd strongly advise to watch extended version and then see how it goes.

Originality of certain scenes made this movie too good to be true. I would certainly watch it again. But maybe skip a few scenes.Many general audience not knowing the character, Wonder Woman, will have a tough time figuring out her role. An individual movie will be helpful. Gal Gadot did a fine job as Diana Prince but as Wonder Woman, not so great. A bit more muscular female artist should've been picked.Superman, man I fall in love with this guy every time I see him. He looks exactly what the comics show us.Lex Luthor, I don't recall him being so small since the beginning of Superman comics. Not very impactive. I've huge respect for Jesse Eisenberg but as Lex Luthor, he did not fit the bill. Needs to be replaced with someone else, if I may be bold to say so.Batman, nailed it. He looked exactly the way BATMAN is suppose to be. Experienced, balanced as Bruce Wayne and Son of Gotham, not too gadgety, raw look, the anger, the calculated risks, determination etc. Even his bat mobile was spot on. He scored a point over Christian Bale from The Dark Knight series, I would say.PEACE OUT!"

" Just Ok - an easy watch (apart from Ben Affleck)
",0.6249,0.9947,2019-08-17 00:00:00,6,"So - I'm not a superheroes geek and I probably couldn't tell you which films are DC and which are Marvel but..I have watched a number of these types of films lately and would like to give an honest review of this. I watched these films in the wrong order - to be exact, Justice League, then Man of Steel then this, which I know is not right but as I've admitted, I'm not clued up on these things! Firstly, I won't even acknowledge Ben Affleck as one of the lead 'heroes' - I'd make a better Batman than him and I'm a woman and English but I think that is partly due to me adoring Christian Bale's take on this iconic figure. I really think this miscasting let the franchise down. But seriously, I really don't get what the issue was that Batman had with Superman - he, more than anyone, should have realised that masked figures can be misunderstood in the crazy superhero universe - it just didn't ring true with me at all. The chemistry between Clark and Lois felt very genuine and the acting was superb. Henry Cavill is a well cast Superman and I felt genuine emotion for his plight. I liked seeing Jesse Eisenberg in a villain role, although it did feel that he was a bit of a subplot rather than a main protagonist and that he could have been utilised more in the end scenes. Gal Godot is stunning as Wonder Woman and wow what a breath of fresh air she was to the plot to balance the bizarreness of the Batman / Superman feud. I actually went back and watched this franchise in the correct order to ensure that I wasn't being unfair in my judgement of this, due to me knowing some of the outcome but no - I still stand by original verdict. Henry Cavill, Amy Adams and Gal Gadot deserve all the credit (with great supporting roles from Laurence Fishburne and Jeremy Irons) but the plot and Ben Affleck as Batman makes it too strange for me to score this higher. I found Justice League far superior though so stick with it just for this!"
" A Messy Story and Weak Characters Make ""Batman v Superman"" A Huge Let-Down
",-0.4767,0.9803,2019-08-15 00:00:00,5,"After the mixed reception to ""Man of Steel,"" Warner Brothers should've known that a change from Zack Snyder and David Goyer was needed for ""Batman v Superman."" Although ""Man of Steel"" was entertaining, it suffered from weak character development and Snyder's gloomy visual style just wasn't appropriate for the material. These problems are compounded and then some in ""Batman v Superman,"" a frustrating mess of a movie that distorts instead of celebrates its popular main characters.First and foremost, BvS is an awful representation of both Batman and Superman that fundamentally misunderstands their appeal as figures of popular culture. This is the movie's biggest flaw and the root cause of why it doesn't work. Audiences love Batman and Superman because they triumph over adversity, stand for justice in an unjust world, and ultimately inspire them to be better people. That's why these characters have lasted for over 80 years. But none of these characteristics are present in BvS, where Batman is depicted as a paranoid, bloodthirsty psycho no better than the villains he fights while Superman is a bland muscleman in tights without any of the hope and optimism that defined Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal. With characters so unsympathetic, it's impossible to remain invested enough in their stories to enjoy the overall movie.The film's plot is an awkward hodge-podge of confused story elements that just don't work together. BvS tries to be a Batman detective story, a Superman redemption story, a Wonder Woman story, a political thriller, a philosophy lecture, an adaptation of both The Death of Superman and The Dark Knight Returns, and an introduction to the Justice League all at the same time. A movie that focused on Batman and Superman's relationship could've worked, as shown in the 1990s animated feature ""World's Finest"" starring Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly. But the writers of BvS squandered their chance to tell a great superhero story by overloading the script with so many disjointed plot threads that aren't even developed enough to stand on their own.In many comic book movies the visuals soar where the story fails. But while Zack Snyder's dark directorial vision worked in ""Watchmen"" it's totally out of place in BvS. The movie is ugly to look at: the few colors you see on screen are often a painful combination of mud brown, pitch black, and a steely gray. Many scenes are so poorly lit you can't even see most of the frame, especially in the action scenes which should be the highlight of the movie. As for the performances, Jesse Eisenberg is cringe-worthy as Lex Luthor but Ben Affleck and Amy Adams are solid as Batman and Lois Lane respectively. Laurence Fishburne shines in the few scenes he has, though I wish he had a larger presence in the movie.Despite some strong performances and occasionally compelling scenes, such as the main titles sequence, ""Batman v Superman"" just doesn't hold together. If you're a fan of these characters, you're better off watching the movies starring Christopher Reeve and Christian Bale. Even the animated TV shows from the 1990s are much more entertaining adaptations of DC's iconic stories. I can recommend certain individual elements, but not the movie as a whole. 5/10."

The first half from the film is very good, however at the second half BVS takes underwhelming and uncomfortable turn, and the third half isn't enough to save the movie. The storytelling of BVS is sloppy and there was a bunch of staff that didn't have to be in the movie, which serves no purpose in the plot of movie rather than just fill in it's excessive long running time. Though unlike others I liked the dark tone of BVS.On a more positive note the action sequences of BVS was great. The performance of the cast was mostly good, except Jesse Eisenberg's performance as Lex Luthor which feels a bit over-the-top.

",-0.4019,-0.9956,2019-08-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie starts with the scene of batman's parents in the alley which we probably have seen many times over and i accept that as a part of the new continuity , and i have to say that the way Bruce Wayne's parents had died is not very epic comparing to the way kal el's parents had , and this adds to the fact that batman is a very much human whose parents die in back alleys getting mugged like any normal people in the world without destruction of a planet and ending of a civilization like that in Kal El's case.we see the destruction that had been caused by the fight between general Zod and superman from the perspective of Bruce Wayne , and for the record the laser in this scene was general Zod's , and by the way unlike many other people i don't find it very stupid not to leave the building during the fighting because as it was shown ; it was a total chaos and not everyone could make a good decision where he should hide , inside a building or outsidebefore i get into this point i have to remind you that batman had been around for about 20 years while superman had been around for a few days only , and the only time clark kent the reporter had heared about batman was when he became violent and branded the criminals who he deemed unredeemable , it was the only time when batman's work showed a real result when everyone became fearing him rather than revering him
and that made this batman a reckoning force that answers to none , he is okay with breaking arms and torturing anybody during the interrogation , that's why every criminal is afraid of him , and here he was shown closer to a vigilante who's okay with killing although they have always made him a killer by proxy as the director described , as if it was the denial inside batman's head that keeps denying that he had killedif we compare superman vs batman , we have someone who's very reluctant and asks for the advice from his mother or lover vs a man who's very committed to his decision against the advice of his mentor , we have a man who's very ideal and believes that the good guys should always win against a man who fought for 20 years without any result and buried many friends along the way , but they are both share being depolarizing the people as many love them and many genuinely hate themit's known that many things of this film were inspired by the dark knight returns comic , in this comic batman said that he feels guilty of killing many people by letting the joker lives , maybe here he's trying to not do the same mistake by eliminating the threat while it was new , he's taking the superman responsible for killing everyone because he was the one who brought Zod's attention to earth and his presence caused the explosion at the senate , and that increased by the dream sequence in which he saw a bad possible outcome of a superman going tyrant which is inspired by the 2014 injustice videogameand here we have to talk about lex luthor , here we have a very different interpretation of lex than any one we have seen , we have a young man who's traumatized by his abusive father whom was traumatized by living in a totalitarian dictatorship , and i have seen an interview of the producer saying that they decided to make lex much younger because they were trying to make him much like these days young genius millionaire entrepreneurs like mark zuckerburg and steve jobs and that also was inspired by the superman birthright comic in which lex is a young mad genius who feels alone due to his genius and when superman becomes public he fights him and tries to frame him to elevate his image in the public eyehere lex is trying to frame superman not to gain from his death but out of his hate to the idea of gods and his belief that the gods should they be present they should be mean like zeus who had punished Prometheus for helping mankind , so he created a god from his own blood and the blood of his adversary to show the dark face of kryptonand here i have to talk about the scene that made me curse in the theatre with everybody else 'save Martha' , when superman said save Martha batman remembered his mother and instantly he's reminded how he started the as the batman and how everything is right now with him crossing the lines over and over and trying to consciously kill someone because he poses a threat , he understood that he became somehow a bad guy and so he took the chance to save the mother of superman a redemption chance and by the way that was the only scene in the entire movie when batman saved someonebut i have to say that until now after 3-4 times watching the theatrical and the ultimate edition of the movie , i still hates how they depicted them being one 5-second conversation away from understanding each other and saving everyone , it was like that they had to fight no matter whatanother thing i hate about this movie that it had a huge screen time for lois lane and her investigation as if they were trying to make her relevant to the story by any means necessaryps: the ultimate edition is the only one that should be seen because it opens the door to the different worlds that lex knew about and the possibility of lex making a barging with them and it shows how his men retrieved the bullets and scorched the bodies at the beginning of the movie to frame superman'sand i have to say that over time i liked how this movie takes right from where the previous one had left and how i liked the action scenes and the dark colors being a fan of zack snyder's work and how superman died is the spitting image of how king arthur died in Excalibur movie which was in the theatre the Wayne family got off at the beginningand i have to give credit to the costume designer who made the batman costume with bruises to indicate that he had fought wearing it many timesat the end , it's easy to find everything wrong about this movie and showing a blind eye about everything that's good in it but i ask everybody to re-watch it again hopefully you will enjoy it as much as i did"

The movie was just too long and boring for the most part. It got exciting around 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie, by then I just wanted the movie to end. The action scenes were good, especially Batman's fight scene when he was saving Superman's mum. Superhero movies shouldn't be 3 hours long (unless it's the avengers) and they shouldn't be too dull and complex to follow, otherwise the movie is going to get hate from the audience, which this movie did."
" It's okay. (Ultimate edition)
",0.2263,0.9882,2019-08-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie really has its ups and downs. First of all the whole building of the movie. The beginning of the movie was (in my opinion) well told. It builds up this whole problem around superman real good but it fails to include Batman properly in all of this. I've watched this movie 3 times now and I still can't tell exactly what his actual issue is? Is it because superman fought an enemy that could've easily conquered earth and destroyed parts of a city? It would be absolutely reasonable if they would build it up properly but the problem is this movie tries to tell 2 story lines; lex Luthor trying to beat superman and batman trying to beat superman. Why not split it up? You could easily make 2 movies out of this.Another huge issue is the writing. Not the story but the dialogues. At some point we get nice comic dialogues that fit perfectly into the movie and the next moment we get dialogues á la Game of Thrones season 8. ""Martha... why are you saying that name?"" come on guys. I don't have an issue with the fact that he stops beating superman up after hearing his mother's name since Bruce Wayne has a huge trauma but could you at least write it better? And this whole confrontation between superman and batman was just flat action. In the one moment superman wants batman's help in the next moment he start beating him up. And then showing his funeral for 10 minutes straight. Yes we got it superman is dead. Could've used some of that time on thinking about something better than ""why are you saying that name"".Snyder did a great job with the directing tho. This movie is visually stunning and has great action (I'm talking about that one fight of batman that pleases my comic reader heart). Hans Zimmer also did a great job on the soundtrack; as always.(And last thing but this is my own opinion: why did you have to make alfred some hipster oldy? He seems like he cares more about his looks and doesn't look at all like someone who was a special agent. Sorry but this character is just as laughable as lex Luthor. Grab a single batman comic and you'll find that whatever they tried to do in this movie: this isn't alfred.)"

The story can be a little confusing if not familiar with who Batman and Superman are, but definitely feels more solid than other hero films made during this time. The only major problem in the film is the difference between the first act and the last act. Much of the last act feels like a different movie compared to rest of the movie, but only because, personally, it feels slightly rushed in feeding the audience information (especially the final fight). Other than this, the entire film feels, like I've said twice already, very solid."

" An Honest Review
",0.5106,-0.2578,2019-07-19 00:00:00,1,"I actually thought that Ben Affleck did a decent job in the role. He did that Michael Keaton thing where he understood the link between Batman and Bruce Wayne and was able to pull off a good Bruce, and that is really where Batman is, figuring out which one is the mask and playing both accordingly.However, it starts... abruptly. It starts with the assumption that you have seen the Superman movies, and for viewers that hadn't it comes across as more than a little jarring. You were expected to understand what was happening from the start and, unfortunately, that's not the best way to start a film that doesn't have the number ""2"" after it.It doesn't have that slow build that explains the story, it just kind of starts and moves along as if the audience is already sucked in... and this with a new star as Batman, and a new universe to host him in.Had it taken the time to let you get to know the characters first, it would have made for a more compelling and interesting film. Instead it moved along as if no introductions were necessary for either the characters or the world they inhabited and that made a lot of people lose interest fast."

",0.0,-0.9941,2019-07-04 00:00:00,8,"""...you will battle him to the death. Black and blue; fight night. The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world. God versus man; day versus night."" - Alexander LuthorI suppose I'm right in saying that this is a movie of much controversy; you either loved it, hated it or thought it was just meh. This can be credited to a common misunderstanding of the film's content. It has been said that the film does not establish the characters that well and that their agendas were difficult to understand. Maybe you WOULD think that. If you weren't paying full attention to the movie.As it turns out, the characters were developed surprisingly well. Superman has already established his agenda of providing hope to the world and displays the exact character coherent with that goal throughout the entire movie.BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE IS SAID!
It is vitally important to understand the context of this film - the DC Extended Universe. This is a dark world. The infamous city of Gotham and all of its atrocities have taken their toll on Bruce/Batman. He is no longer the 'nicer' version of Batman with the no killing rule. Let's get something straight, though. Batman doesn't kill all the time. HE HAS ALMOST BECOME THE ""HOLLOW SHELL"" THAT IS ILLUSTRATED IN FRANK MILLER'S 'THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS' and was set in motion as inevitable by Heath Ledger's the Joker when he claimed ""Batman has no jurisdiction"". That said, it is likely that Batman may become more of a criminal eventually. People simply don't want to see this sort of Batman in films.
""In the dream, (the bats) took me to the light...
... a beautiful lie.""This powerful quote is saying that Bruce thought that becoming Batman would make his life and world better, but it didn't. It only made him sink further into his personal darkness. This is sad. A bit depressing, but sad. This is to be expected when ""Batman has no jurisdiction"". THAT'S RIGHT ALL YOU BALE-OBSESSED FANS! Batman is not perfect. Maybe not even good. Effective, but not always good. HE'S CALLED THE DARK KNIGHT FOR A REASON AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE WEARS BLACK! He plunges his ""hands into the filth, so that you can keep yours clean"", to quote Gordon from The Dark Knight Rises; he is like the dark knights from the Arthurian era: he works by this own methods to serve a kind of justice. Ladies and gentlemen, this... is the true Batman.
Bruce, having spent ""20 years in Gotham"" fighting its crime and seeing ""how many good guys are left... how many stay that way"", is terrified that superman will become bad like everyone else (including Batman himself). Only this time no one will be able to stop him.
It was important that Superman said ""No one stays good in this world, Lois.""The dying humanity left in Bruce comes back to him when he is about to kill Superman and the last thing Superman thinks about before he almost died was his mother. That struck Bruce hard. It reminded him of his own mother and how much he cared for her. Bruce couldn't kill someone who had that kind of a bond in his life.When Heath Ledger's the Joker's destructive agenda was mysteriously insinuated people were intrigued, but Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor made sense. He has grown up in an unfair home with a cruel father (hinted at in the 'Smallville' television series) and now does not want some other form of God to rule his life unfairly. Lex claims that God (or rather, anyone who is in a great position of power) is always evil. He says that ""the world needs to see the holes in the holy"" and since Superman is already being questioned by almost everyone for his reckless actions, Lex wants to seal the deal and make it official. He claims some kryptonite for himself, but has that stolen from him, so he continues his work in the kryptonian vessel. You could say that he used Doomsday as a last resort.
I would like to mention that Lex's script had some excellent parts to it at times.Is this movie pretentious? Maybe a little, but truthfully, this is a very serious concept. Something truly epic and truly dangerous is going to happen. I haven't seen the ultimate edition yet, but I heard that it is better than the theatrical release because it explains more, though it is 3 hours long.This is undoubtedly an under-appreciated movie.
But coming from a DCEU fan, Justice League could've used some work and Suicide Squad was trashy and boring at times."

The visuals and cinematography were outstanding. the battles were great. (6 viewings, 12/28/2020)
SPOILERS
The opening scene was beautifully shot and very moving with great music. The next scene which was the first action sequence was very creative and clever. It was the final battle from man of steel, but from Bruce Wayne's perspective. I think it was a great way to show how Bruce Wayne first found out about Superman. the batman fight scene when trying to save martha was AMAZING, probably in contention with batman v bane for the best batman fight scene. and the final battle was so EPIC with unbelievably awesome musicI wasn't a fan of the whole Superman is dead thing at the end of the movie when everyone in the theater knew he was gonna be alive, could have done without it. The whole thing with Lois Lane at the end when she wanted to hide the spear, but then wanted to get it back, but then was drowning, but then superman saves her, but then Superman was drowning and she had to save him... useless and should have been taken out of the movie. and the intro to the other justice league members should not have been in this movie. it was moving so well and that just slowed it down with something that was irrelevant to this movie. it doesn't bother me too much, but there was too much setup for future movies, and it's not the only exampleI think it was a missed opportunity for a scene that shows the moment Bruce Wayne finds out that Clark Kent is Superman, or when Superman finds out Bruce Wayne is Batman. They went in a different direction, which i guess is ok."

",0.4767,0.9737,2019-06-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful movie. Zack Snyder really has done a brilliant work on this movie. His take on Superman and Batman is the not very different, it's how people who have been through what these two characters have, should be. Ben Affleck has excelled at his role, the best Batman in live-action cinema till now. You can really feel the pain that Batman has gone through his life, his portrayal is accurayete for a man who has everything yet does not have what he wants, he's had close one's die and the fact that he has spent nearly 2 decades in a undying city of crime has changed him right to the core. Then comes Henry Cavill's Superman, possibly the best take in the character's long history in movies. He kills it with his act. Superman is still confused about his part in this world and Cavill just shows that in a brilliant manner. Every actor including Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, Jeremy irons, etc have done a splendid work. The visualisation is brilliant, cinematography is top notch, the score is obviously outstanding. Plus, this OST for Batman really describes the damaged person that he his. This movie will have a cult following in the future and will go down as the greatest CBM ever made."

" Wasted Potential
",-0.4939,-0.4198,2019-06-12 00:00:00,4,"I found Batman v. Superman very disappointing. First of all, the movie is very muddled and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's clear that Zack Snyder and the writer Chris Terrio were attempting to develop themes, but these themes are never really communicated well, partially due to the unnatural, forced dialogue. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill attempt to bring depth to their characters, but Batman and Superman are both portrayed as one-dimensional brooding a-holes. The plot is a convoluted mess. Not to spoil anything, but the story is so needlessly complicated and nonsensical that it becomes quite difficult to tell what's going on. The story is also dragged down by numerous unnecessary characters and lame attempts to set up future movies. The visual style works in many places but at other points, the lighting and composition is just ugly and drab. The CG is pretty shoddy at points and the action is very hit or miss. The Batman warehouse rescue is a fantastic action sequence and probably the best scene in the movie. The actual Batman vs. Superman fight is pretty cool as well. On the other hand the end fight scene with Doomsday is just a boring overload of CG. Many of the things that work in this movie seem like they were thrown in for the sake of being cool, as opposed to fitting organically with the story. Because of this and the other criticisms I've mentioned, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice ultimately just feels very underwhelming."
" 6.5. Tough to like after Nolan's trilogy

I didn't hate it and thought it did some things well but DC is not handling the whole shared universe in movies thing well. Like marvel or not they worked on their formula for years and properly developed the characters. For me it was jarring to go to a fantasy like film after the Nolan bat trilogy. Some say it was too dark but I found that to be one of its strong points and something that sets DC apart from marvel characters. Man of steel was an overall better film than this I'd say which shouldn't be the case given the story. I think Ben affleck did an overall good job at an older angry Batman. Same with cavils Superman I think he played it well just don't think either of them have been given a strong story or direction to work with. It's worth a watch just for the nerd in you to see Batman and Superman dueling it out but that's not enough to carry the rest of the film

This movie completely represents what DC is all about. The film lasts something less than 3 hours, it is phenomenal, filled with awesome fights, especially between Batman and Superman, it introduces Wonder Woman in a fashionable way, the story it tells is what people in real life would be concerned about, the visuals are perfect, in comparison to Justice League that came out later, but it is way worse than this movie. The ending scene is also very fitting to the sequels, altho I did not like the fight with the huge monster that much. Lex Luthor was portrayed perfectly and I would like to see him again in some of the upcoming movies."
" One of the most divisive superhero films ever made
",0.0,0.9929,2019-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Oh, man. Where does one begin with BvS? I believe at the beginning.When I first saw Man of Steel in theaters, I loved it. I felt it was a good starting film for the DC cinematic universe like Iron Man was for Marvel. I was excited for future DC projects...right up until I read that the sequel would essentially be a major adaptation of my least favorite Batman story: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, an (in)famous graphic novel which ended with Batman beating the living daylights out of Superman. I watched several of the trailers that came out subsequently and felt my displeasure at the film rising, especially with the 'Do You Bleed? You Will' comment at the end of the first trailer. I heard about some of the casting choices and I was not too impressed at who Snyder had chosen to play Diana and Lex Luthor, but vowed to keep an open mind. Finally, I saw the trailer where they showed Doomsday, and I knew how it was going to end since I had read a certain other comic that they were using for inspiration: The Death of Superman.Despite all my misgivings, I decided to go see the movie, since I really couldn't give a proper review of the film unless watching it. I managed to sit through most of the film, but after about two hours, I stormed out in seething anger. For several years, I openly despised and derided this film in both the Theatrical and Ultimate cuts. After watching and heavily enjoying some of the more impressive DCEU films like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, and yes, Justice League, I found that BvS was starting to grow on me in a way and I have learned to tolerate it.The film still has its poor points. Most prominent is making Batman essentially everything he wasn't in Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy. I thought the idea that Ben Affleck playing Batman and Bruce was actually good casting, by the way. However, Ben didn't portray Batman as a noble knight, but as a down-and-dirty brute. Batman openly kills several people in the film directly, but also acts as a judge, jury, and executioner towards other characters.Also, the comparisons to Superman to the Christian God got a little over-the-top, which is also something that drives me nuts about recent DC comics comparing the heroes to Gods, despite them acting incredibly flawed.Of the Trinity of DC heroes portrayed in this film, Gal Gadot is the best as Diana Prince. Well, at least around the Doomsday battle when she is kicking some major-league butt. But I thought she was way cooler in her solo movie and Justice League.Jesse Eisenberg is ridiculously stupid as Lex Luthor and thoroughly more ridiculously unbelievable than Hackman or Spacey. I know everyone compares him to Mark Zuckerberg, ironically, but this is not how I see Lex Luthor. I think Luthor should be a shrewd businessman who is like the Jared Harris portrayal of James Moriarty, not the Andrew Scott version of Moriarty who is a bratty little boy who doesn't want to share his toys with anyone.Visually, this movie is peppered with iconic shots, which is something Zack Snyder excels at. The score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenberg is okay and slightly cool, but it just seems weird that Zimmer was brought in since he did the score to The Dark Knight trilogy films. Wonder Woman's theme is great, really, and Lex's score was the only thing I enjoyed about him, but everything else was odd with all the ominous choirs of angelic voices.Also, I think some of the characters' potentials are wasted in this film. Wallace Keefe should have become Metallo instead of bringing Doomsday in. Also, Mercy Graves was woefully underused as well as Jimmy Olsen and Perry White. Plus, the Ultimate Cut's character played by Jena Malone was a true disappointment. I would have preferred to see in the final fight with Doomsday that Aquaman and Flash would show up, as well, essentially uniting the majority of the League. Finally, I think they should have tied in the Arrowverse shows and characters. A lot of wasted potential there.That's the big problem with DC. Despite it having all its properties under one roof in comparison to Marvel back then (before the Disney-Fox Merger), DC doesn't tie its universes together for no real reason. And now with this recent news about DC splitting up its established Universe into two and not focusing on any more team-up movies, it's really annoying.Ultimately, DC has been falling apart since the immense divisiveness of Dawn of Justice in regards to its Cinematic Universe. It's had a few solid hits, and now that Marvel is done with the Phase Three films, DC has time to flourish a unified cinematic and television universe. Instead, it's just constantly restructuring itself to the point of giving up on a successful Cinematic Universe. So, in short, perhaps Dawn of Justice shouldn't have been made like the final product it was."

" Hastily-Done Match Up: Dawn of Mediocrity
",-0.0772,-0.0843,2019-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Batman v Superman's flaws derive not solely from script or directing, but from the movie's production. So eager to have their own Avengers, the DCEU decided Man of Steel was enough build-up to bring in Wonder Woman and Batman out of the blue, all for the sake of a battle that wasn't properly built up to. The fact of the matter is that this movie needed to be set up by another film or two for its plot to feel earned. The actual film isn't terrible, but it's ridiculously flawed. Lex Luthor is a joke of a villain. It's other villains are even bigger jokes and much of the film's last act makes the rest feel irrelevant. Even worse, the last minute of the film makes the last act feel irrelevant. There's a lot of stupid in this movie from ""Jar of Piss"" to the infamous ""Martha"" dues-ex plotpoint. This film thinks it's an intellectual and mature superhero film like the Dark Knight but it's just a dumb action film playing with themes it neither understands nor uses correctly. The only reason I don't rate it lower is because I liked Batman a lot in this film, especially his amazing fight scene which makes me not regret seeing this in theaters."
" Lack of ""Superman v Batman""
",-0.3182,0.9918,2019-05-19 00:00:00,4,"Felt rushed. I am disappointed with how they portrayed Batman. He killed most of the goons in almost every fight scene. There was an inspiring scene about how Superman talks about each others family and it reminds him that he doesn't want kids to grow up as he did. And then two minutes later he explodes a four by four car full of people. Perhaps a little too edgy. Zack Snyder is capable of directing great movies. But he is mainly great at making edgy movies with a really dark tone. Like Watchmen for example. For what he gave us, the pace moved nicely. People didn't like Ben Affleck as Batman even before his performance. But I think he's great. Just a terrible script. There was too much slow-mo. And I also felt like we didn't get enough Batman v Superman action - which is quite ironic since the title is called Batman v Superman. I will never like Amy Adams as Lois Lane.They easily could've just cut Adams side story out. I could've been more surprised if Lois didn't build up to Lex's secret. I thought it was cool getting Bruce's perspective on Superman way of justice. I don't know why, but when Lois was trying to get spear for Doomsday it bugged me. I hated that scene so much. Jesse Eisenberg didn't play Lex Luthor he played Lex Luthor Jr. I found him ok but even though he is his son - I preferred the old Luthor big and tough. Interesting bringing Wonder Woman to the screen. It has been years since we got her on the big screen, and we were lucky to get Gal Gadot to play her; that costume was great. I was very disappointed to see them kill off Jimmy Olsen. He was wasted. He died so quickly as well. Doomsday CGI was awesome. Thinking that a bigger movie could only introduce such a big character like Doomsday.Superman, unlike in Man of Steel, had emotion put in him. I didn't like Jeremy Irons as the legendary butler. The Justice League clip was fantastic. I love Flash and can't wait to see Flash in his upcoming movie. The weird flash forward was just weird and unneeded. Not the worst thing I have seen. I don't understand how this was supposed to be a commercial for Justice League. They included one single scene which contained a few of the original League members from comics. It's like saying Iron Man was a commercial for the first Avengers movie because it stared Iron Man. the sound track was awesome - the best in the DCEU so far. The dialogue between Batman and Superman could have definitely been improved. To sum up: Lois Lane is Lame, Batman is too edgelord, Superman hasn't improved since last time I saw him on the big screen. The dialogue was bad. But it's pretty bad-ass!"

It's one of the best movies of any genre I've ever seen, I do not understand why some people hate it. I could watch the Batman warehouse fight over and over and still be in awe of it. It's incredible."
" Best Batman movie to date
",0.6369,0.9788,2019-05-17 00:00:00,9,"Having been a huge DC comic and movie fan the Batman films have for me, never been enjoyable until Christian Bale.
That said, having now watched this movie and Justice League I firmly believe that Ben Affleck is by far the best Batman. He fully embodies the character of Bruce Wayne and Batman and I strongly believe these movies would not have been as successful as they were without him in it.In turn, Henry Cavill and Amy Adams are excellent and I'm excited to see if future plans include another standalone Superman film.Overall a solid movie, with great characters and storyline."
" Fans of Snyder's visual style will not be disappointed.
",0.3724,0.9014,2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,"While the push to get to the Justice League movie made parts of this film seem rushed, the pacing was actually pretty good considering its 2.5 hour run-time. Some of the visually over-stimulating battles have been toned down since Man of Steel (2013), and casual comic-book fans will recognize many of the characters (despite their non-canon interactions).What I tended to enjoy most about this film was its subtle art, allegory, and symbolism. After all, Snyder does excel in a visual style that is entirely his. In the moments where he pays homage to classical conflicts of good vs. evil is really where the beauty of this piece lies."

" Greatest Superhero Film Yet
",0.6369,0.96,2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Not much to say this late to the party.. IMO the greatest superhero film yet.. Everything considered?.. Snyder's signature visuals just keep getting even better since his former classics, '300', 'Watchmen', and his castings? Perfect---->ALL of them.. Fong's cinematography, Zimmer's score (never heard such a time out of mind theme so perfectly suited to a character as is 'Is She With You?'), Terrio's/Goyer's screenplay, everything, just flawless.. All of the misunderstandings and percieved 'flaws' initialy surrounding this work of art have long since been accounted for, so no long detailing required.. The quality level of these original D.C. E.U. productions, 'MoS, 'BvS', 'WW', wasn't/isn't present in films after WB chickened out of THEIR own mandate and left us with grossly lacking 'SS', 'JL', even 'AM' (all not in my Blue Ray library) for all it's BO sadly contain's an overly plagued script that's quite sub-par to these initial (THIS particular) original EU films.. Zack, Chistopher, Ben?.. 3 most talented directors together?.. No, there was never anything wrong with D.C. Creativity.. BvS would have easily broken past the $bil++ mark had WB released the Ult. Ed. back in '16.. This one see's the most rotation in my home theater system.. WB so sadly in the dark, WAKE UP if you think you're finding as perfectly matched a teamup as Henry and Ben any time soon, even more so, as visioanary a director as Zack (watch and see, they'll be begging Snyder to return soon)"
" It's a dumb movie, but it has its moments.
",-0.2846,0.7845,2019-05-03 00:00:00,5,"The action, Wonder Woman, Batman fighting Superman (for 8 minutes), and Batfleck is probably my favorite thing in the movie. Although I do enjoy these moments, the story that drove them to do these things is ridiculous. The movie was trying to compete with a franchise that's been going on for 9 years and doing so, they cram so many things into one movie without time to understand instead of making a movie about each DC characters like the MCU. I do enjoy the movie, is just that things that are happening in it makes it feel unwatchable to me."
" Affleck and Cavill are perfect casting for an imperfect movie
",0.34,0.9148,2019-05-03 00:00:00,3,"Chritian Bale may have made it difficult (not impossible) to recast Wayne however I believe they pulled this off with Affleck. This man has the looks and brooding presence of his comic counterpart down! The same goes for Cavill. Again, by far the closest the film industry has come to matching what we see in the books. Having said that, this film fails in every other aspect. The writing is terrible, the effects are average compared to what movie goers expect these days. I think Zack Snyder was the wrong choice for this movie. Why the hell?! After 300, his movies have just been so bland! If Affleck and Cavill were given Different scripts and better/more creative direction then this could have broken records! Cavill, although a smart choice was partnered with the wooden, uninteresting Amy what's her face. Seriously, every time she came in screen it was time to pee just for something more interesting to do than watch a character that did not offer anything to the story. Don't get me started on Lex Luther, Jesse 'no talent' Eisenburg?! Really?!. The casting department needs to have a serious word with themselves about their future in this industry. How did they land on him as the best choice? I know it's a newer movie, but have you ever seen Vince Vaughn in ""Brawl in cell block 99"". There's your lex Luther right there! If thwy recast Luther and Lois, keep Snyder and his writers as far away from this franchise as possible, then, I might consider going to see the next movie with high hopes and smile on my face. Gal gadot is great also. Could be more authentically Amazonian but I'll let that slide if Eisenburg is nowhere to be seen. His awkward nerdy, querks are getting old. Not suited to a destinguished, confident, towering villain like Lex Luther. Maybe as his butler....just a thought"

" Snyder vs DC
",0.0,0.9849,2019-04-26 00:00:00,3,"This film confirms a lot of my feelings about Zack Snyder. I think he excels at capturing great visuals but needs simple stories, which are well established to give meaning to those visuals. His best films are adaptations of graphic novels that stray little from their original source. As soon as he is asked to branch out, he seems to flounder.I can't say I recommend this film. If you like Batman and want to see him fight against a foe who is superior in strength, check out ""The Dark Knight Rises."" If you want to see Superman in all his iconic glory try the animated film ""All Star Superman"". If you want to see a great Zack Snyder interpretation of a graphic novel, try ""The Watchmen"".If you want to see a disappointing film, see ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice."""
" Epic & Realistic Superhero Tale w The Best Collection of DC Characters Ever On Film
",0.6369,0.5371,2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,"** I am reviewing the Ultimate Edition BluRay with Additional Scenes **I love this movie. It probably should be rated R - it's, by far, the most violent of DC comic films. Batman returns to his 'pre-WWII' form by using guns to shoot (and kill) many people throughout the 160+ minutes. Amy Adams is still great as Lois Lane. I find the word 'Epic' to be overused this decade, but there is no other way to describe the 'Batman v Superman' and 'Batman & Superman & Wonder Woman v Doomsday' fight scenes. And, speaking of Wonder Woman, best casting decision ever made in a superhero franchise.Although this is a sequel, it plays like a stand-alone film (especially the Ultimate Edition). People are emotional about Superheros and Comic Book Characters - I feel that explains the current 6.5 composite IMDB score. In the future, this number will rise. This film will hold up over time.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Why is lex Luthor trying to destroy the world exactly?"" Martha? Really that name defuses 2 hours of movie conflict?"" Why does superman get a heros burial when to most everyone it would appear he blew up the hearing? On and on. It just doesnt make any sense and for that reason I cant recommend anyone ever sees this. It's a waste of your life... I'm sorry, batman and superman shouldn't be killing people but if that's what you wanna do to sell tickets, at least make some kind of sense.

" Simple unbiased review
",-0.0258,0.9869,2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"This film can be less received by the general audience because it focuses more on visual storytelling, rather than heavy dialogue to emphasis plot.It is a film that requires more attention to its artistic nature in order to appreciate and understand the themes, metaphors and characterisations.Is it a perfect film? No. But no film is perfect, and this film is a rare find in terms of blockbusters and Hollywood.Films that require you to analysis and think about the context of the themes and ideas, are movies in my opinion that will stand the test of time.Looking at this film subjectively, it's an interesting spectacle, as a DC fan, it's challenging but in a positive manner.These characters have a solid foundation of mythology and it's interesting as a DC fan to see different takes on the material and in a way learn about the reasons why I love these characters by seeing different versions of the material.Is it your Batman or your Superman? Maybe not. But the core essence of those characters remains within the context of this film and story. These characters in this film, are deconstructed and grounded to suit a realstic society that's similar in nature to our own."
" Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice Review
",0.5267,0.9818,2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"In the wake of Zod's assault on Metropolis, Superman (Henry Cavill) is eyed by many with suspicion, not least Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) and Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck). Both formulate schemes that could see the alien destroyed for good.
In The Lego Movie, Will Arnett's Batman sang an ode to being glum in Gotham, which included the lyrics, ""Darkness! No parents! Continued darkness! More darkness, get it?"" But even he's out-moodied by the iteration in Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice. For those who thought Man Of Steel was too gloomy and navel-gazing, we have some bad news: the addition of Bruce Wayne to the franchise has not lightened the mood any.
Horribly scarred both inside and out, Ben Affleck's grey-templed Darkest Knight is so morally burned out that he not only subdues foes, but tortures and brands them like cattle. His dreams are plagued by screeching, man-sized bats. Not even the very pleasant water feature in his lakeside cave cheers him up. There's nothing wrong with a little angst, but here it's doubled down: pitting him against an insecure and self-doubting Superman, Zack Snyder's movie is a spectacle that proves heavy on visual pizzazz but markedly light on fun.
For those who found Man Of Steel gloomy, there's bad news: the addition of Bruce Wayne has not lightened the mood any.
As with other 'versus' films - Alien Vs. Predator, Freddy Vs. Jason, Kramer Vs. Kramer Vs. Godzilla - the title carries a charge of giddy promise. Two titans of pop culture will, we are assured, rearrange city streets with each other's faces. And once it arrives, the fight is a tightly choreographed, berserkly overwrought treat. But talk about delayed gratification: Snyder makes you wait, and wait, and wait for the championship bout. As the colon in the unwieldy title suggests, this is really two movies squished into one. Besides another run-through of Bruce Wayne's tragic backstory (including an odd nod to John Boorman's Excalibur), Dawn Of Justice strains to both set up a plausible conflict between the two superheroes, and shift pieces into place for future sequels and spin-offs. It's a film with a lot on its mind.
The main plot starts well enough. A Rashomon-style replaying of Man Of Steel's finale through the eyes of Bruce Wayne, as he slaloms through Metropolis in a tiny black car in an effort to rescue his employees, helps us buy into his rage when it comes to Superman. (Could it be that Snyder is channelling all the angry comments he got on message boards about his previous film's destructive finale?) Wayne's pissed, he's paranoid, he's going full Trump. Affleck underplays the role nicely, exuding rumpled world-weariness like only a man who's survived Gigli can, and dispelling any lingering memories of Daredevil. Then along comes Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Sporting a Banksy T-shirt, chomping on Jolly Ranchers and throwing random ""Mmm!""s into his maniacal monologues, the character is going to be an acquired taste - it's not difficult to imagine him popping up in one of the Joel Schumacher Batman films. Less up for discussion are his schemes, which are both numerous and not massively well thought out, despite the fact he frequently appears to be omniscient. One explosive set-piece, in particular, is visually impactful but has no real effect on the story.
Affleck underplays the role nicely, exuding rumpled world-weariness like only a man who's survived Gigli can.
For most of its run-time, the film focuses on talk over action - a Sucker Punch-ish nightmare sequence, in which Batman takes on Kal-El's super-troopers and flying, shotgun-toting bug-men (one of several nods to as-yet-unseen mega-bad'un Darkseid) is a fun if slightly pointless exception. Jeremy Irons proves a fine Alfred, sternly ticking off Bruce and even making lines like, ""You are to deception as Mozart to the harpsichord,"" sound good. Holly Hunter spars with Eisenberg in the thin role of a US Senator, while Scoot McNairy plays a former Wayne Enterprises employee with a grudge against Superman. There are too-short interludes with Clark Kent, who we learn has signed up to Dropbox. It's all very solemn, very operatic, and a bit dull.
It's with an hour to go that Dawn Of Justice goes nuts. Following a wonderfully camp training montage in which the Dark Knight furiously pumps Batbarbells and chucks a tyre around, he and Supes go cape-to-cape through the slums of Gotham, a sight to justify the slow and gloomy build-up. There are ultra-sonic blasters, machine-gun turrets, kryptonite grenades, everything but the kitchen sink. (Our mistake: a sink gets smashed on someone's head, too.) It's here at last, amid the crumbling masonry, that the movie discovers its joie de vivre. Which is why it's a shame that Snyder feels the need to throw in a hulking, city-smashing Uruk-hai afterwards. A climax to a climax, it's CGI overkill, making for a generic and exhausting denouement.
As for the DC world-building, there's a lot to take in, though much of it amounts to a superhero watching clips of other superheroes on a laptop. Metahumans are glimpsed - hastily setting the table for next year's Justice League, doing in four minutes what took Marvel four years - though, with one trippy exception, they don't actually interact with our principal characters. That honour goes to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, a character invented in 1941 and only now making her big-screen debut. Gadot's dramatic powers remain to be tested, but she at least makes a big impact in the final reel's showdown, unleashing her Lasso Of Truth and power-sliding all over the place. It's a landmark moment in cinema, executed well. Still no sign of Dawn, though."
" Reality that no one cares !!!
",0.3971,0.9765,2019-03-22 00:00:00,9,"It's not a recommendable movie. I just loved the film because my taste is of a different type. Generally, no one keeps a huge focus on film story unless they are a film critic or some other professionals. This movie has plot holes but I liked the deep meaning which it has (or at least I think it has even if the director did have no idea of it). In my opinion, this movie just told us what if there is a superior being among humans who try to do good but as humans, we are always endangered when there a superior being among them, some of us either try to control him and some of us believe him as a god-like creature. I'm a huge fan of comics! So I like how Snyder made Batman's grudge against Superman (close to the comics by Miller ). But this movie contains some badass Batman scenes. I didn't like the film at first but after multiple watches, I began to fall in love with the film. At last, I say that this film is not for everyone. Watch it according to your interests. And this film has wasted potential like the fight between Batman/superman and doomsday fight."
" Far underrated movie that is very enjoyable if you answer the questions this film asks.
",0.4927,0.9828,2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie, while not perfect is far underrated and misunderstood. The characters have clear motives that drive them if you simply care enough to listen to their dialogue and the world the movie takes place in is realistic and immersive. These characters have real consequences to their actions and they are forced to deal with issues that are very prevalent in modern society. It offers a gritter feel that requires a person to think about the events and not just simply watch for entertainment. While it is not Marvel it has a dark charm of its own. This movie also does a great job of humanizing Superman as we see him face problems he would face in a realistic modern society as opposed to seeing his typical perfect boy scout persona. Snyder does a great job of showing the Dark Knight morally shaded Batman and a side of Superman we don't usually get to see while he is on his way to becoming the comic character we all love. Terrio and Goyer do a great job of subtly revealing characters true intentions and motives while not force feeding us information. It's darker tone is a nice break from most superhero films and provides a realism not easily found in this kind of movie. While not on the humorous side the movie does have its share of comedic moments while providing a very intense and entertaining dark version of Batman. Some of the moments in the movie are a little too dark and it moves a little slowly but the plot progression was well worth the wait. You know why these heroes are fighting and contrary to most beliefs you know the reason they reconcile in the end. Batman has trouble accepting this otherworldly god like figure and doesn't see him as a hero to man until he is humanized. The ultimate edition of this movie is much better and the addition of the cutscenes flow together much better than the version that was released. The plot was so immersive once i stopped thinking about what everyone else thought of the movie and created my own opinion I forgot Doomsday looks like a rejected ninja turtle/ slimy green marshmallow. This is a fairly good movie that was butchered out of some of its potential by the studio. My advice would be to not go into the movie thinking you're going to get a Marvel movie because that's not what this is. Instead go in expecting to see a story about 2 heroes who are both struggling to accept the other in a world where what's different is feared and it is rare to see an act of kindness without personal gain. This is a film that asks controversial and challenging questions and doesn't play it safe. I personally enjoyed the film and the different take on society it provides."

",-0.34,-0.8991,2019-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I can see how people have issues with this movie. I had that too when I saw it at the premiere.The bad :
Doomsday design and purpose
Slooowly phased.
Too many stories that doesn't get the space they deserve.
Released before its time.This movie is great. Even with the Martha scene and I'll tell you why. Batman IS a f upped character. Suffered from trauma of his parents death at a young age, watched several of his friends been tortured and died. He feels unbelievable guilt and rage. When superman first shows up and wrecks everything because of zod (equally powerful God). He gets scared. This one threat, that's not only in the center of messing with Gotham, could destroy the planet. This makes sense. Bruce wayne isn't a normal individual no matter how smart and charming he is. His actions are justified and reasonable from his perspective while superman tries to fit in in a world less human than he is.This movie was heavy, you need to pay attention. After seeing this 4 times. I still notice something else. Superb action, soundtrack, acting, cinematography and story BUT this movie would make a lot more sense if it were a standalone film without connection to any universe. Or to be released after several other DC films. This was released to quickly to try to compete with the avengers. That was a mistake. So many scenes ended up being confusing for the average movie goer. And know that's snyder is gone, we will not see the full circle in this Phase one of the Dceu. Not perfect by any means. I'm not saying that. But this is not the average superhero movie. Just like batman, drop the killrage. See this film again, (ultimate edition) and try to actually understand it. You can't turn of your brain like many other superhero movies."
" As real as it could be.
",0.0,0.9921,2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I have never seen ever, a superhero movie that deep since Watchmen. Details on the plot were outstanding. Man of Steel couldn't have asked for a better sequel than this. The Ultimate cut was way way better than the theatrical one. A perfect setup for Justice League. As Henry Cavill's Superman continues to find his place in the world of strangers. His existence becomes a conspiracy theory. Normal beings on earth having mixed reviews about whether their should be a Superman or not? Or whether he should answer to anyone? A Rigid Broken Man who got hurt in the events of Man of Steel takes things in his own hands. As he thinks he is the only person planet who could fight this probable threat to Human kind. Batman's Portrayal as Batman is beyond perfection. He doesn't just portray the Pain of Bruce Wayne but also his rage and rigidity. The balance Ben's Batman and Bruce had in BvS with limited screentime which was shared with Superman and Wonderwoman in a Superman centred plot, was tremendous. Ben was clear about being Batman and using Bruce Wayne as a maskup and a perfect one. He was likeable and inspiring as Bruce Wayne for his employees. As Batman he was serving his mission well without any second thoughts. He was not searching for an escape even after a 20 year reign of crime fighting. I think as a whole, Batman/Bruce was perfectly written and portrayed in BvS. This completel and concrete portrayal of Bruce/Batman's character was missing even in Nolan Trilogy. Gal's Wonderwoman was inspiring as she had a cameo, still she managed to make fans around the planet. Cinematography of this Superhero flick is out of the park. Zack Snyder delivered the punch again. The Score was on point. Hans Zimmer's and Junkie XL's genius written all over it. Plot was spread wisely and provided every necessary detail. Dialogues were written well, executed well. It kept the Dark and gritty tone as well as the Heart of the characters from DC Comics. Its a delight for a true Movie lover."
" Wow, this sucks!!
",0.4374,0.813,2019-03-11 00:00:00,2,"Words cannot describe the stupidity of this movie. The plot is everywhere and more confusing than a 1,000 piece puzzle. As for the acting, most of it was over the top,(Jesse Eisenberger) or too dull,(Henry Cavill) the only performance I enjoyed was Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This only gets a 2 star because when the actual Batman v Superman battle begins, it is pretty spectacular. Other than that, dont bother wasting your time on this garbage"
" Not Very Super, and Threw Away the Greatest Superhero Story of All Time
",0.2113,0.9475,2019-03-11 00:00:00,5,"Let me start by saying that I am a Superman guy. Yeah I like Batman too. But Superman has been my guy since I was a child. Even in my 20s, I rushed to the store to buy the Superman/Doomsday comics on the day they were issued. I read in (almost) in tears as the Man of Steel fought Doomsday until he had nothing else to give. Then he gave his life to save Metropolis.And then I find that incredible story of sacrifice stuffed in at the end of this gloomy, uninspired film, as a sort of throwaway scene. You gotta be kidding me.Just about everything has already been said about this film. Its too dark, etc. I mean, it just wasn't fun at all. It has the feel of a horror film, set in some dark, distant place. Did anyone leave the theater thinking they want to grow up and be like Superman?DC could have had the movie of the century. They could have spent a few years developing the other heroes, and then gone for a Doomsday movie with an ensemble cast. Guaranteed blockbuster, which would have led to several spinoff films. Instead, they wasted a great opportunity to show the world what makes Superman super. Unlike the Marvel heroes, Superman isn't super because of his powers. DC, you failed. Again."
" What Went Wrong With Justice League?
",0.0772,0.9946,2019-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Overall Perspective:It does not live up the potential of the brand. It is important note that the circumstances that led up the film being helmed by the two separate directors are both tragic and completely outside of the control of anyone involved that being said it did not exactly do the film any favours while most of time it is hard to tell the Zack Synder scenes from the Joss Whedon's ones. It is not possible to omit fact that the film had two directors that affected and apparent overall film pacing and tone. However, it is very apparent in the film's pacing and overall tone, while pacing could be racked up to the film short runtime more on that later but by the way the tone is extremely inconsistent it is almost as if they are tried to keep the gritty down-to-the earth feel of the previous DC films while injecting some comedic moments to lighten mood. These moments are more likely Whedon's influenced as he is known for those kind of character interactions while they do usually produce at least chuckle from audiences the fact that the heroes are cracking a lot of jokes sometimes sort of dire times is a bit odd to say the least and while it was reported that a lot of the post production time was spent to meld Synder and Whedon's tones together seamlessly did not really work out super well. Overall the movie just leaves impression of disjointed and unpolished.The Run Time:
Duration of movie was around 130 minutes including the mid and post credits. This is fairly reasonable Hollywood movie. However, the Justice League does not meant to be short at all. It was not until a mandate from the higher-ups at Warner Brothers came down. It is definitely shows the first hour so the film was incredibly badly paced and jumps all over place there are scenes that only last a few seconds before cutting away completely unrelated. Frankly, it is a little bit jarring. The worst part of the movie, it was easy for audience to figure out there was something missing at several points throughout film. Idea was introduced only to get zero pay off such as Batman supposed quilt over the death of superman which was only offhandedly mentioned.Characterisation:
Another serious problem in the movie was the film was so centred around its character the audience actually get very little in the way of characterisation. Unfortunately, outside of a few selected moments in the film, the only character that we see that has any sort of serious growth is Diana who deals with the loss of Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman and her place in the world. Beyond that overall the audience have hint at Cyborg a little bit flash and the Apper characters. Technically development does not present Aquoman, Flash, Cyborg background who were newly introduced in this film. In most movies, the presentations of comic heroes are not accurate as in the comic books. These new three characters really could have used the audience does not know those new characters in the film content. However, most entertaining part of the movie was the flash scenes. He was always entertaining the audiences but not as accurate as in the comic books.
Challenge to Marvel Cinematic Universe:
The biggest problem with DC movies overall not just the Justice League and that is the fact that they are desperately trying to play catch-up with their competitors the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). When Marvel and Disney launch the MCU, no one expected it to be juggernaut that it is today. Over course of the ten years they have put out seventeen films all of which have been considered as successes. Therefore, DC comics wanted to get in on the superhero film craze. The problem is Marvel already released five films before the DC comics were making it to their big team up. All the MCU were solo films meant to introduce audiences to the main line-up DC has gone another route. It has not done any favours to DC Cinematic Universe. They have rushed to try to put out of four that came before the Justice league one of the movie was a sort of mini team-up movie and another one had basically nothing to do with the Justice League at all that being suicide squad. The audience have not really gotten any time to get adjusted to DC Universe or the characters have not mentioned the fact that the films are only tangentially connected them at best. Overall the film was rushed, Computer-generated imagery (CGI) not exactly look great such as the villain Steppenwolf in the movie looks like character out of the game console Sony Playstation 2 (PS2) video game. DC universe can definitely produce better movie and unfortunately all of points mentioned above hit the Justice League hard. All the characters presented in the movie should have had their own solo films. Despite of all these setbacks DC film universe does still have some potential. The Justice league despite of all flaws could lead to the next big success for the franchise. DC and Warner Brother has to do is to learn from their mistakes."

" What a mess
",-0.3612,0.9876,2019-03-03 00:00:00,2,"I heard about how about this film but decided to watch anyway. If Man of Steel (2013) had any promise of being a decent start to the Justice League franchise, then this movie just took that and destroyed it!!!!!To get it out of the way, there were a few good things about the film. I did enjoy the visuals, the fight scene between Batman and Superman was pretty good, and many the actors were chosen well for their roles like Affleck as Batman and Jeremy Irons as Alfred. But they are outweighed by bad points of the film.First off, Batman being one of the great superheroes is also a great detective! He's able to figure out anything and yet he wasn't able to determine that Superman wasn't the enemy and Lex Luthor was manipulating everyone. Next, Lex Luthor's portrayal by Jesse Eisenberg was embarrassing to the character. This has always been a cool character being diabolical, sophisticated, and charming and yet this guy is like an over the top cartoon villain. Additionally, doomsday was pointless to the film other being bait for fans to see the movie.My other problems with the film involve its structure. There are so many subplots that are trying to build up to the next films that it does nothing to the narrative going on the film. Then there's the three acts of the film where the first act (the build up) seems to take up so much time before the actual fight and they quickly run through the last two (the last 30 minutes).All and all, it's an irritating film that ruins the Justice League for me especially having grown up with the cartoon. If you enjoy it then cool with you, but I can never."

The Ultimate Edition, that is. The actual theatrical version is garbage de absolutio. This was saved in the UE.Zack Snyder's magnum opus follows an emotionally challenged world, dealing with the pressures of Superman's dramatic saving of Metropolis from the nefarious forces of General Zod in Man of Steel. Bruce Wayne realizes that he must stop the Superman, fearing he has come to destroy us all. What follows is an amazing deconstruction of politics, religion, and society. It went limp at the box office, but future generations will discover it, and it will one day be spoken of in the same breath as Citizen Kane and The Godfather. WATCH IT."

" Beautiful trash
",0.5994,-0.9897,2019-02-26 00:00:00,5,"A truly awful second film to continue the DCEU with. Zack Snyder is a visual director and the visuals in this film are truly beautiful surpassing Snyder's previous 'Man of Steel'. The effects mostly through the second half of the film are truly awful, as the final villain Doomsday looks like a failed ninja turtle. The story attempts to present itself as ""Deep"" but ultimately just doesn't make sense and is not executed well. Ben Affleck makes an excellent Batman and makes the character unique and his own in this interpretation, while Henry Cavill struggles as Superman to find good direction as his character barely says anything throughout the picture and is not an interesting hero to follow. The villain is extremely weak in that of Doomsday being a giant Cg mess and Jessie Eisenberg makes for an awful Lex Luthor channeling the character into a ""Joker"" type villain. Attempting to set up the entire Justice League into this movie makes it feel like another 'Iron Man 2' except it's not fun. The action is lackluster when there even is action, and the final fight is meaningless as it is just punching. The score by Hanz Zimmer and JunkieXL is excellent and makes for some memorable music. The music and visuals and Batman are essentially the only fun or interesting aspects of this movie, whether that makes the movie intriguing enough for you to see it is up to you, but it is truly a disaster of a film."

" Absolute Masterpiece

This film explored characters and themes as nuanced except WITHIN a world that's as fantastical as the comic books.Not many filmmakers would have taken two of the biggest superheroes of all time and showed them at their lowest in their first ever live-action film together. Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio have created the '2001: A Space Odyssey' of superhero films.This film will disappoint you if you go in expecting Marvel-like approach. If you are seriously into this genre, watch BvS at least twice. This film gets better with each viewing."
" So Much Potential, So Much Waste
",-0.4728,0.9443,2019-01-23 00:00:00,4,"Just re-watched this for our Podcast (After Credits Cast) and I'll drop my two-cents here.
Best part of the film is basically any time Gal Gadot is on screen. I think THIS bat-suit is the best of the brand, but mostly because it seems like Affleck can move in the damn thing. Some of Superman's more subtle powers (sunlight giving him strength & super hearing) are showcased really well here. And there are a few visual moments that look REALLY good and helped make great trailers.
The rest of the film is a convoluted mess and I fail to understand any level of admiration for the film beyond fans of Batman or Superman refusing to admit the problems. Luthor's plan of framing Superman for the murder of those African War Lords made no sense. Batman being so easily manipulated and overly emotional made no sense. The philosophical battle between the two leads was non-existent. Doomsday is a terrible character in comics and in film. Luthor's portrayal was one of the biggest sins committed to comic book film, right behind the Bat Credit Card of Batman Forever. Amy Adams is wasted in this film. And shoving in clips for other DCFU characters into the film in the least subtle and least creative way possible.
This isn't entirely the fault of Snyder. The lack of subtlety and lack of a coherent story are mostly on him. But the studio is largely to blame for rushing this out and chasing film trends that the industry moved on from ages ago. Namely, the overly gritty and dark super hero films. They've found more success with both Wonder Woman and Aquaman. This film's central idea isn't really focused on, and the conflict feels manufactured and forced versus the characters really NEEDING to fight.
We waited DECADES for these two iconic heroes to cross over in live-action. Instead, I will enjoy the animated versions that treat the characters and their history with some level of respect. Plus, I can enjoy Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy at their best."

Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"
" Audience vs. Studios: Dawn of Anger
",-0.5719,0.9925,2019-01-22 00:00:00,3,"I once liked this film if not loved it. Maybe it was the fan of superheroes and comic books inside of me, because this movie is a pile of dog feces.It is only the 2nd film of the DCEU, and its critical failure resulted in fans of DC comics and other audiences to be conflicted upon the films that would come out, where their stories would occur in this fictional universe. Here are some why this movie is not a 100% misfire, as well as reasons why this movie is still awful.Pros:
Some good and okay performances, with Ben Affleck being a pretty good Batman for the most part. Gal Gadot is an awful actress, but I thought she was a good choice for Wonder Woman.Despite some problems with the CGI, the visual effects and action sequences are pretty good, with great choreography, decent visual effects, and massive spectacle.It has some good philosophical ideas, such as when the film talks about the difference between god and man, and discusses about how it would be like to have god-like abilities and have society hate you, simply because they do not fully know you.Cons:
Jesse Eisenberg is obviously a terrible choice to play Lex Luthor. He is goofy, annoying, and over-the-top. He is does not seem intelligent, diabolical, sophisticated, and criminally-charming like the Lex Luthor that many Dc fans love as a character.Henry Cavill seems like a good choice for Superman, but he gives a bad performance filled with no charisma whatsoever. I feel like it is not his fault, because the script he is given to work with is awful, it seems impossible for Cavill to give a good performance.There are characters who feel like they do not have enough screen time and they seem pointless to the story, such as Alfred, Perry White, and Martha. Wonder Woman is especially a very pointless character, and she serves no purpose in the story. I feel as if her inclusion in the film is only to make DC fans pay money to buy tickets to see this piece of garbage.-There are many hilariously atrocious and logical inconsistencies. From Lex pissing in a jar and sending it to Senator Finch, to the infamous ""Martha"" moment, the film has it all.
Lois Lane is a partially intriguing character, trying to discover the truth about the massacre in Africa, and uncovering mysteries with the culprit being Lex. However, her character is completely useless in the third act, when she thows away a Kryptonite Spear, only to bring it back, resulting in her drowning, then get saved by Superman, which leads to him being knocked out by the radiation of the Spear.The plot and execution of storytelling is really bad. The movie spends an unnecessary amount of time building up potential sequels and spin-offs, and it does it in the laziest way possible. An example would be the clips of Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg that Bruce sends to Diana, which felt lazy and hilariously stupid. In other times, the film is very confusing when you try to analyse the plot, with moments like Batman's dream sequence of an post- apocalyptic world. It especially sucks that some scenes are eliminated from the final product, making the plot unorganized and confusing, and that you need to buy the ultimate edition in order to fully understand the story. Even then , there are unexplained plot points, such as how Lex knew that Bruce was Batman, and how Clark was Kal-El/Superman.Its treatment of DC comics source material is awful. The movie burns through future films worth of good materials by rushing and misusing comic book stories such as The Dark Knight Returns and The Death of Superman. It is obvious that these guys are trying to play catch-up with Marvel. The characters that I adore are given awful alterations, where it does not feel like Zack Snyder and others involved in this film cared about them, and wrote them in a way that make them unlikable. Batman is a killer instead of a person who appears to be a brooding jerk, but also has compassion for others, and has a moral code to not kill anyone, like the original Batman. Superman, is a depressed man with no charming personalities, and he does not exhibit qualities of compassion, truth, and justice, like the original Superman. In addition, the film feels dark and gritty, leaving no sense of hope or existence of a joyful moment, which makes this world that the film has built even more uninteresting.Overall, I obviously do not recommend this film, its it awful, inconsistent, and even though it has some positive aspects to it, they are overshadowed by the numerous issues it has."

" DC Fan Girl Disappointed
",-0.2023,-0.9245,2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,"I grew up on DC comics and comic book characters. And as much as I loved Wonder Woman, I was very disappointed by this movie. Not so much the storyline which I felt was very out of character for Superman and Batman to hate each other on sight without provocation or cause, but because there had to be a dozen different possibilities to introduce the Justice League than start out with Superman's ""alleged"" death and Batman's guilt over inadvertently causing it. I had my doubts that Ben Affleck could play a convincing Batman and they weren't unfounded. He did well as Bruce Wayne, but I didn't feel the Batman love as I did with Christian Bale or even Michael Keaton's portrayals. Henry Cavil still delivered a solid performance as Clark Kent/Superman as did Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman and Jeremy Irons played a PERFECT Alfred. The biggest disappointment by far on screen was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I don't know if it was written that way, directed that way or just how he felt he needed to play the role, but his portrayal of Luthor was all wrong. Lex Luthor wasn't psychotic or even an actual psychopath, he was a narcissist, he was ruthless, cold, calculating and brilliantly evil, but he was NOT crazy or insane. They made him to be a lunatic with a wide streak of psychotic insanity and a massive chip on his shoulder. Yes he had that hate for Superman, but he wasn't ""cray cray"" crazy the way they had Eisenberg play him, it was honestly cringeworthy to watch. The total and complete fear and distrust they had Batman show for Superman was so ridiculous for Batman. Batman was cautious and distrusting, but never to the point of wanting someone who had showed no purposeful hate or evil to die. Batman didn't kill it was against his code of ethics so to have him want Superman dead was pathetically out of character for him and a total waste of film time. This could have been an amazing movie and even Superman's death should have been a bigger plot than it was, it was almost like an afterthought rather than the focus of the story. Poorly written script, partially decent cast with so-so cast to support made this a good film to watch IF you really have a love for DC characters and have nothing else good to watch."

The pacing is so slow it's amazing and the fight we were anticipated about was short and pretty anti climactic in my opinion.
They did worldbuilding over character development, they sprinkled some development here and there but in the end we got nothing special when it comes to character development.
Superman's ideals should have been challenged more so that the characterization of Superman becomes better.
And shortly the Martha scene was just bad, the idea was cool but poorly executed.ARES EFFECT
You guys know the ending of Wonder woman were Diana killed Luddendorff and then Ares showed up? Yeah those who have watched Wonder Woman will know but the reason i call this the Ares effect is because of that ending.
Yeah BvS came before WW but that effect was more known in WW than BvS so i will call it the Ares effect instead of the Doomsday effect.
BvS did the Ares effect.
They had an interesting but bad villain being in the movie and then at the end they just shove in Doomsday there so that they could kill Superman.
Lex wasn't a good villain he had interesting ideas but he didn't get enough screen time to show how good he could be but it's even worse when they shove in a villain who dosen't get any development at all and is there to kill Superman.VERDICT
Justice league is has no care put into it.
With BvS they try to make something good, they had an idea and went for it trying their best.
Justice league is nothing, it's not a movie cause it has no soul put into it that's why i will change my JL rating to 3/10 instead of 5/10."
" Half good, half worst thing ever put to screen
",-0.296,-0.4685,2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"This is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen because there is stuff in it I love and there is stuff in it that I hate with a passion. I was a bit skeptical when I heard that Ben Affleck was going to play Batman/Bruce Wayne, but I was sold with his performance as soon as he came on screen. Henry Cavil was really good as Clark Kent/Superman too. My favorite scene in the movie was when Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne meet for the first time. Seeing them argue about Batman and Superman being threats rather than heroes was exactly what I wanted to see, but that scene was ruined the moment Jessie Eisenberg's poor excuse of a Lex Luther portrayal interrupts the conversation between Clark and Bruce. Jessie Eisenberg playing Lex Luther was the absolute worse casting of a comic book character I have ever seen, and I've seen Topher Grace's Venom portayal! They absolutely should not have had the Doomsday storyline because there already is way too much crammed into this movie. This movie also cheats the audience because even though it is almost a 3 hour movie, Batman and Superman only fight for about 5 minuets! Don't call the movie ""Batman V Superman"" if only about 3% of the movie is a fight between Batman and Superman. That's like if you changed the title of ""Rocky IV"" to ""Paulie's Robot"", it doesn't make sense because the robot is only in that movie for 2 or 3 brief scenes. The best metaphor to describe Batman V Superman is that it is a lot like the Batman cereal that came out when this movie did. The Batman cereal was chocolate-strawberry flavor and it did not taste good because there was way too much flavor going on clashing with other flavors. That is the best way to describe this movie! I give it 5 stars because there are 5 stars for everything that is good and 5 stars missing for everything that is bad."
" I hope Zack Snyder Doesn't Care About Bad Criticsm.
",0.4805,-0.7664,2019-01-09 00:00:00,8,"And I hope Zack Snyder keep making movie with his taste.I don't know why people don't like this movie.the first time I watch this movie, instantly amazed me.
and when I see the bad review, so I think maybe I missed something, so I watch it again, and still didn't see what's wrong.maybe people make marvel as a standard superhero movie.
what makes this film good is a very different comparison of power, between Batman and Superman that make this movie is interesting.and how batman can beat superman.
that's because batman is super smart person and unafraid.batman knows that superman can resist all attacks, but why batman just wasting bullet and weapon only to be destroyed by superman.Batman wants Superman to feel victorious, not only fighting physically, but also but also psychologically.batman know superman strong physically but not mentally.Imagine, Doomsday is Superman but Monster Version, that is mean Superman has 1000x human strength and Doomsday has 1000x Superman Strength.the lack of jokes in this movie that made this movie perfect, because batman is difficult to make him laugh.a little mistake would ruin the character of Batman itself.
but people just said this is a bad movie because too dark.at the end of the movie, it leads to Justice League Comics, which superman rise from the dead and become evil."
" The Fight You Were Waiting For... Is Still Yet To Come...
",-0.3818,0.998,2019-01-09 00:00:00,6,"It's the battle we have waiting for to appear on the big screen: Batman Vs Superman. Zack Zynder (best known for Superman Man of Steel & Watchmen) returns to continue Superman's story with the introduction of Superman to Batman. But wait .. there's more! To top it off, if you're aware of Batman's story from comics or ever heard of the Justice League team (thanks to DC Comics) we have a film that feels like it is starting the journey for the many characters in that team and who I'm sure we'll see in other films (like we have seen already with the world of Marvel). Although this could bring excitement to an audience member in the cinema, it's sadly one of this movie's flaws (will explain more on this shortly).As far as the plot goes, many citizens are concerned about the ""Man of Steel"": is he a God? Will he bring more dangers to earth (as we saw in the last film)? Could he take over the world? Bruce Wayne (Batman) as you will soon discover, has his opinions towards Superman and reasons for those opinions, but one thing's for sure. According to Bruce Wayne, Superman must be stopped. We are also introduced to Lex Luther who only makes matters worse...So how did the main actors go?
Ben Affleck puts on the Batman suit for the 1st time and I'm happy to announce I feel he did a great job. Is he the best Batman we have ever seen? Maybe not. But credit where it's due- I did feel Ben Affleck did a fantastic job as not only Batman but also the role of Bruce Wayne. I would assume it would never be easy tackling the two roles. Superman is back and he's the same as we've seen from the previous film ""Man of Steel"" (No complaints about Henry Cavill) and this is the same for actress Amy Adams who returns as Lois Lane. The only actor I found disappointing was the well known villain from many Superman films ""Lex Luther"", which was tackle by actor Jessie Eisenberg (Zombieland & The Social Network). Lex Luther in Batman Vs Superman comes across more of a crazy person with quick (and yet very random) responses. Lex Luther from what I always recall was a smart and yet a calm criminal/evil villain. Jessie Eisenberg hasn't done a horrible job, I just simply feel as an actor, he would have been a much better choice if he was casted as ""The Riddler"" in further Batman film. Hans Zimmer Score/Soundtrack is also perfect as we have heard in the previous Batman films and he was joined by Junkie XL.So you're probably asking yourself 'if most of our actors did a great job is there any issues with the film'? Sadly, yes there is.The main issues I have with film is really relating to the director and the way this story is told. Be prepared to see a film that goes back and forth (to past and then present) but also we experience many ""dream sequences"". To top it off, at one point I personally was confused that we may have had a dream within a dream moment. The story is also cut up to follow many characters of the film and at time feels it felt like it. As mentioned at the start of this review, there are many characters that ""sneak in"" hinting at things to come with this franchise. Normally I would enjoy these kind of moments, but with this film it feels more forced and it simply adds more to the film when we are already taking so much in as it is. Without giving much away, I can assure you this is something that many people have seen before in the world of Marvel movies (Iron Man, Ant Man & Avengers and the list goes on). Does DC Comics want to complete with Marvel?Overall, I can say if you love your action you won't be disappointed for both Batman and Superman. The film has done an amazing job with presenting such a stunning film visually, with bright clear sound effects that bring the film alive. The film's biggest let down is the story telling going everywhere with so much being all crammed in one film. The director's 1st cut was supposed to be over 3.5 hours which I would be curious to one day view in my lounge room. I feel this could be a better version to watch compared to the theatrical release which we can assume cut some of the stories you can tell are missing. I also personally think that if the film had more of a basic story with less characters I would have given this film a greater overall score.I must also suggest if you're thinking of seeing this film to avoid any of the film's trailers- I feel Warner Brothers have really shown way too much information when it comes to the film's trailers. I've personally watched one of the trailers that allowed me to predict the film's start and ending without hard effort.6.3/10

BvS lacks a good script, the editing is a mess and the characters development is badly done with a lot of wasted potencial. The cgi is good until the end and things just happens. Lex Luthor is a mess without motivation.

My favorite parts were the ones with wonder especially when she came down to save Wonder Woman wow!

As for both adults, things can just be solved by talking, yet they bring it to fight. Why they fight? Because hero simply fight. I found it uncessesary. Maybe I'm too logical on this, but we are human watching superbeings, logic is there. I think write can improve on this."
" Great Source Material Poorly Utilized
",0.6249,-0.9827,2019-01-03 00:00:00,3,"When you think of Superman and Batman you think of the most iconic Superheroes that exist. There is so much material to use, so much depth but this film uses none of it.
The film takes itself too seriously and shouldn't as the script isn't strong enough and the plot is weak, not only that but they waste the opportunity to use the best villain in all comics who is instantly recognizable but made to be almost a cowardly wimp, Lex Luther is not well written. The main villain is a CGI mess. The overall use of CGI makes the whole film look, strangely, cheap. It is used in scenarios where it isn't needed.The next major issue is the plot itself, I don't want to leave any spoilers but the plot is woeful.Ben Affleck deserves better as he has potential as Batman but in the 3 or 4 appearances to date has been in terrible films with no impact."
" Excellent movie, but not perfectly executed
",-0.4943,-0.9893,2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Note: I am reviewing the director's cut of the filmFirst off for any concerned parents, this movie did not deserve an R rating. It was in no way more violent or explicit than your standard PG-13 movie.The biggest aspect where I think the movie failed is the climax of the two superheroes' battle against each other. While it's clear to see the director's intentions in hindsight, the scene really needs more context during the film to be made immediately clear to the viewer.Another common complaint is that Batman breaks his one rule of ""do not kill."" When I first watched this movie, I was very angry with Batman's apparent murder of several villains. Upon rewatching the movie, I noticed that, aside from an absurd dream/alternate dimension sequence, it is actually possible to see how Batman did not kill or did not intentionally kill the majority of people he confronts. This movie does take a more borderline depiction of him, similar to the Arkham video games, where he does several things that take enemies to the brink of death, and then if they die as a result, it wasn't exactly caused 100% by him. However, there is one single death in the movie that is very difficult to argue that Batman did not intentionally kill.Despite that, this movie succeeded in everything else. The new take on Luthor paid off very well to provide a unique Superman villain. All other aspects of the movie were executed expertly."
" Good film with great potential
",0.7906,0.8865,2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I really like Ben Affleck as Batman and Henry Cavill as Superman. There are some spot-on elements in this film, but I can't shake the feeling that the wheels are starting to come off from the studio side- my guess is too much interference from the studio, and likely too many chiefs there.They're too distracted by Marvel and will ultimately sabotage themselves.Also, Jesse Eisenberg does NOT work as Lex Luthor, and the Lex Luthor character story falters solidly.So, this is likely the peak of the DC Batman/Superman/Justice League films.Gal Gadot is awesome and the standalone Wonder Woman film is great."

I liked the backstory of the two and although it was not the best movie I was happy to watch it. It then just went all a bit wrong. Everything got chaotic, the plot made less and less sense and the end showdown was just one big gigantic CGI mess. I cannot blame the actors much. I did not mind Cavill as Superman and Affleck as Batman showed promise. Gadot also did well. Eisenberg's as Lex Luthor was totally miscast though and his portrayal was totally not my bag.

Jeremy Irons is also great as Alfred and is really funny. Zack Snyder's direction is great and the film looks incredible. The CG is consistently excellent throughout. The fight between Batman and Superman is incredible but could have lasted longer. The music by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL is amazing.

" Ultimate Cut is the true experience, epic and a superb story.
",0.7003,0.9971,2018-12-07 00:00:00,9,"After watching it for the third time, second with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing.
The fighting sequences are well choreographed and the warehouse scene, one of my all time favorite live action Batman scenes! There are more powerful action sequences, but the movie is about the politics and drama and not as action heavy as Man of Steel.Henry Cavill is great in this film but Ben Affleck really steals the spotlight, but the character development that Clark Kent receives is worth it as he's one step closer from becoming the superhero we love and know so well.
Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman is brilliantly played and written, the character has been criticized for killing as Batman never kills. I understand and I got a problem with it to but I know why he kills in this movie, he's angry but everything comes down to all the loss and depression he suffers. He doesn't have anything good left in the world, Dick Grayson got murdered by The Joker. His only family and probably only friend is Alfred, and when Zod's attack on Metropolis happened, Bruce Wayne saw it up close and witnessed allt he death that these God like beings could do and realistically, he wants to do something to prevent from more harm and its a human thing to do, to hate. Zack Snyder's Bruce Wayne is more flawed than any other portrayals of the character but it might also be the most realistic portrayal of Batman.Lex Luthor's big plan isn't really what you expect from a villain in a comic book movie. It's political and well thought out, something that can highly likely happen in the real world. It's another element that makes the film so great in my eyes, how the writers and Zack Snyder wanted to make the movie realistic and portray Superman in a way that would happen in real life. Jesse Eisenburg plays Lex in a fresh and unique way, not really comic book accurate but I strongly believe that after the character development from this movie he will then become the Lex Luthor we know and love. But I have to admit it, I like Zack Snyder's version of the character and Jesse Eisenburg did a terrific performance as the iconic villain.Many people doesn't appreciate the dream sequence that's called the Knightmare, I understand why as it drags down the pacing. But why did Zack Snyder choose to place it into the movie? It all comes down to his 5 film plan that he never got to finish, the dream sequence shows us what would possibly happen if Darkseid wins in the future and that means Superman will turn bad. In my opinion it's smart writing.I understand that this movie isn't for everyone and that's alright, but I love it. The visual storytelling, gritty and realistic tone, original and simply fascinating to look at as the imagery is perfection. Zack Snyder nailed it with the Ultimate Cut and have created an epic superhero film about two of my favorite heroes.(Edited this after my 4th watch)"

I thought, ""they cut a whole half hour of action? That makes no sense? They couldn't have cut a half hour of story, who the Hell would do that?"" Warner Bros. Would do that. I watched the ultimate edition the day it was released and was taken aback. It actually made sense. It wasn't the story I wanted but I couldn't wait to see more.I found myself defending this film. It was dark, daring and showed us as different side of these characters. Snyder also managed to fit in a time travel cameo of the Flash. That scene blew me away. The more I thought about it, the idea that the future of these films might be preventing this dark future got me very excited.It is a shame they never got to finish this story with Justice League.

" Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is an epic comic book movie, way ahead of its time
",0.5267,0.9987,2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Since ""Batman v Superman"" is a movie that literally changed my life, I wanted this review to be perfect, but I'll just be myself and express my thoughts and feelings about it.Let's get to the good stuff, or should I say awesome stuff. First of all, Zack Snyder nailed every single casting choice, especially Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/The Batman and Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (ofc Henry Cavill as Superman, but we already know that from MoS). Also, his direction is phenomenal, giving us some of the best moments in comic book movie history and the best Batman fight scene in ANY media. Almost every single shot is screenshot-worthy, thanks to Zack's amazing work and use of film instead of digital camera.The memorable moments and quotes are so many that I won't even get into that.The acting is superb, with Ben Affleck's Batman being the highlight of the movie, inspired by the great Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns 1986 4-issue comic series. Henry Cavill gives us the best Superman performance we've seen so far and Gal Gadot makes a great first appearance as Wonder Woman. When it comes to non-superheroes, Jesse Eisenberg delivers as a young Lex Luthor, Amy Adams as Lois Lane is even better than Man of Steel, Jeremy Irons is a great Alfred Pennyworth and Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Senator Finch (a character created especially for her). Even Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Lauren Cohan as Thomas and Martha Wayne do a very good job in just a minute of screen time, without speaking a single word, thanks to Zack Snyder's incredible visual narration.The plot is something that we've never seen in such a comic book-y movie (not the concept, but the execution) and I'm sure it's gonna be appreciated in the years to come. Don't forget, it's called Batman ""v"" Superman and not Batman ""vs"" Superman for a reason. Also, this movie probably has the best climax in comic book movie history.Last but not least, watch the ULTIMATE EDITION! One of the biggest (if not the biggest) reasons that this movie currently has just a 6,5/10 rating is the butchered theatrical cut.10/10"

Because there are some great action scenes and this is a big comic event. This movie's biggest mistake is; it is trying to tell lots of storylines. No can do it in just 3 hours. It is really a big time for a film by the way. Also there are some unnecessary scenes that I didnt like it. Even though Batman and Superman have played awesome by Affleck and Cavill, Lex Luthor and Loise Lane characters has written so bad.

I really thought this would be bad having Jesse Eisenberg play Lex Luthor but I was impressed.
Superman is great hands down
But this movie really has some issues such as
1. does nobody know what a spear is for?
2. why would anyone think Superman would shoot a bunch of terrorists in the heads
3. Why did Superman not see or hear the bomb in the wheelchair
4. How did doomsday become so powerful so fast
5. Superman survives a nuke but not being impaled.
6. not enough Batman action
7. Poor CGi"

Watching it again certain confusing parts of the plot made much more sense. Third viewing was the best as I could piece things together more easily. As a stand-alone film it's pretty rubbish and confusing. As part of a deeper story it's absolutely amazing.

most of its heroes a street-punk type vibe, whereas these have a Greek-god/goddess type vibe. Unfortunately the audience prefers everything candy-flossed and want jokes even during war scenes. Which is why we got the mess of Justice League as Snyder could not fulfill his vision. Sad."

After suffering Suicide Squad, I was told this would be an improvement, that was bad, but this was plain awful.Batman beating Superman up, oh please, was this written as a story, or just fanboy pleasing. I can imagine this having very limited appeal, to a specific set of people.Some effects were great, some were pretty average. I didn't like the story at all, but worst of all was the horrific casting of Eisenberg, who I found almost unwatchable. They wanted to make Lex Luther loathsome, sure they managed without even trying. A Russian villain, how utterly and incredibly original, must have taken serious numbers of meetings to come up with that idea.Henry Cavill does a fair job once again as Superman, but I think he's totally overshadowed by Ben Affleck, who's charismatic and still super buff.Fan boy pleasing zzzzz 4/10"

",-0.296,-0.9967,2018-10-26 00:00:00,1,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I mean it's frickin Batman meeting Superman for the first time on the big screen for god's sake, I have fond memories of reading their comics and watching the Justice League cartoons as a child but Zack Snyder just doesn't get these characters.This film is honestly a disgrace to the legacy and history of all the comic book characters it adapts, his brooding Superman is basically Batman with superpowers, Batman is a remorseless killer and Lex Luthor is a wannabe Joker mixed in with Mark Zuckerberg. It's like Zack Snyder thought how to best make these characters as unappealing and as far removed from their traditional portrayals as possible and then decided to make them the opposite of what makes these characters intriguing and interesting to people.People at this point might interject to tell me these characters were changed to fit the story that they were trying to tell, but I'm telling you that the plot is a nonsensical mess too. Batman is pissed off at Superman because he holds him responsible for all the deaths and destruction caused in Metropolis but then goes and runs over a bunch of criminals and people's properties with his Batmobile, what a hypocrite. Not to mention the worlds greatest detective doesn't even bother to do a background check on Superman despite meeting face to face and knowing his real name and where he works at earlier in the movie, which if he did, he'd know that Superman has a human mother named Martha and we wouldn't have to deal with one of the most poorly executed and hamfisted scenes ever put on film. Lex Luthor's ""genius plan"" when he fails to get Batman to kill Superman is to unleash an unstoppable killing machine that in no way could possibly end up well for him, either Superman defeats Doomsday and Lex goes to jail or Doomsday kills Superman and destroys everyone and everything in it's path which just happens to be on the planet Lex frickin lives on, what the hell was he thinking.
Honestly the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. Some people might be going are you for real? What about abominations like Catwoman or Green Lantern? While they were terrible absolutely terrible films, I wasn't anywhere near as invested or hyped for those films as I was for this one. The fact that I had so much expectations from this just makes this film far more disappointing than any other poorly made run of the mill superhero film."

This seemed like a perfect time for them to take advantage of the superhero hype! What I didn't know is that DC is trying to simply get their money and leave. The DCU is capable of great animated movies.... exceptions are there but their live action movie give me diarrhea. Suicide squad... made me want to commit suicide. Batman vs Superman was throw up in a blender. They casted the last people anyone would have casted. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY LEX LUTHER WAS PLAYED BY THE SAME GUY AS MARK ZUCKERBERG?! Lex Luthor is a cold, calculated, yet charismatic evil genius from a Latin decent(not to mention a athletic dude)..... Instead we get another overly done, ""inspired by heath ledger's joker"", whacky villain.... what's worse is that he's played by a pitifully inconsistent little dude who I'm guessing would not ever have been cast had they planned to use his role for anything more than a bug-eyed bed-wetter...Lastly I can't believe they attempted the plot this movie tries to take on. They tried to knock out like nine different comics with this one movie. The death of Superman, the dawn of the justice league, Batman vs Superman, etc, etc. This is simply due to the lack of patience that is required to make happen what the marvel universe has so delicately constructed. They simply tried to mash as much content into the movie as possible which distracts from the lack of building material, character interactions, backstory, cgi physics....."

Keeping aside that, lets talk about bvs(ultimate edition). You should probably watch that only because you know its a complete version. The problem that why people usually dislike these kind of movies is that they make you think deep. And of course many people are not so well at it. You need to keep your focus on the movie throughout the time thats when you understand it. Basically, this film is not just about the stuff on the surface, it also is more asthetic and philosphical. And if you don't like the movie its fine, you still can watch xmen series and dc animated movies. Gosh i wanted to see the 5 movies.

" Batman V Superman Dawn of Missed Opportunities
",0.1027,-0.9872,2018-09-23 00:00:00,4,"The only good thing i can say about batman v superman is that the acting is solid for the most part. i would give the action a pass but then again if Batman had the kryptonite spear all along and his goal was to kill superman why didn't he use it to begin with? The action being avoidable is the least of my criticisms at least the action is fun to look at, but that aside what was Zack Snyder thinking? Snyder doesn't understand either Batman or Superman in the movie and Wonder Woman is just in this because the script says she is. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is basically Gene Hackman's version only 10,000 times more cartoony and obnoxious. Gene Hackman at least felt like Lex Luthor, Eisenberg as Luthor is just idiotic and has no other characteristics. Of course the infamous 'Martha' line is one of my biggest criticisms for more reasons than one. I've spoken to people who defend that part by saying it's a PTSD flashback that made Batman think about what he had become. that would be an interesting idea except that PTSD doesn't calm you down and make you think about your actions. in fact it does the EXACT OPPOSITE!!! First Blood has a realistic portrayal of the idea of PTSD and what it does to a person's mentality. Zack Snyder is even stupider for claiming he was following the comics when he clearly wasn't. The ending of the film Superman dies fighting doomsday which was entirely pointless because Wonder Woman was standing there. She was using the lasso to restrain doomsday but if Snyder was following the comics like he said then anyone can use the lasso. Batman used the lasso in the comics and he was just standing there. Alternate Ending proposition: Superman retrieves the spear and gives it to wonder woman who hands the lasso to batman telling him how to use it, she then throws it at Doomsday's chest killing him and they all live happily ever after the end. The ending is so forced it literally angers me!!! i'm only rating this higher than Justice League because Justice League has no excuses for it's flaws."

It's an incoherent mess of a movie that makes little sense, lacks any real purpose and seems to go on forever.The whole idea of having two superheroes battling each other is a terrible one and should never have passed. It's clear that this movie is just a quick Hollywood money spinner, with minimal effort put in to developing a convincing plot or script. Instead, it's just all action and special effects, and even for a superhero movie, it's very heavy handed and overdone. 'Dawn of Justice' is a mess, and at two and a half hours, it also drags.

The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of ""out of control"", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his ""origin"" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of ""god vs man"" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great ""out of nowhere"" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"

",0.5927,0.8956,2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,"I want to be clear that i am reviewing the ultimate edition and not the theatrical cut itself which really was bad.
Good:
Most of the performances with Ben Affleck Gal Gadot and Jeremy Irons being the highlights
Brutal action
Beautiful visuals(Zack Snyder's biggest strength)
Darker tone helps to differentiate it from other marvel films
Mature themes of power, human nature, political debates and family and more
Fills up plotholes of the theatrical cut and gives a better and more coherent plot.
Hans Zimmer leaves the superhero music department with a bang.
Bad:
Jesse Eisenberg's performance thought charismatic is somewhat hindered by the inconsistency of his casting
Writing does not always live up to the rest of the film(particurlarly the big character switch and the cramming of multiple storylines into one film take away focus from the main title characters of the film)
Mixed:
the characterisation of the main characters may not suit well with every dc fan"

" The ultimate edition improved the theatrical release immensely
",0.4767,0.9371,2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Batman v Superman was anticipated by many and upon its release crushed all hopes of good DCEU movies. At least that's what the critics said. A billion bucks in the box office despite poor reviews is an achievement. I have to say, the theatrical release had its flaws, most of them due to the editing, incoherent storytelling at times and Jesse Eisenberg. I'm glad to say that Zack Snyder's Ultimate Edition is here to fix most of it. Snyder is infamous for his cuts. Every movie that he released a director's cut for improved the theatrical release by a mile. Watchmen is a prime example, if the theatrical version is a 9 from me - the director's cut is a 10. I honestly hate when the producers cut the movie so much that the film loses a lot of characterization and becomes extremely choppy. Thankfully, with Zack Snyder's Ultimate Cut, the lengthy runtime is very well justified. It fixes the pacing, stretches action sequences, and lets us understand more about Batman and Superman's rivalry. It's still very flawed, however. Lois Lane's character is pretty much irrelevant, even though they tried to give her some purpose to be in the film. Jesse Eisenberg's odd choice of mimicking Heath Ledger's Joker with that horrible squeaky voice and constant twitching made him extremely annoying and overwhelming to watch. The movie also seems to suffer from a lot of studio involvement because it tries fit so many different comic books into one. It should've just been Batman v Superman, but it also spent quite some time setting up Justice League and Wonder Woman, as well as going by the Death of Superman route. To me, the positives overcome the negatives in this flick and made it an enjoyable watch. Also, Ben Affleck was unfairly criticized for this role, while actually being the best part of the movie."

" Its half YAY half NAY!
",0.6625,0.9745,2018-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Man of Steel made us all believe that WB was upto some thing good. This film thrashed all our hopes.WB's crazy deal to make DCEU films dark and camouflaged to black and Zack Snyder's fanatic ideas for a broken Batman made this deal a lot worse. Messing with Earth 31 Batman to suit his vision itself was crazy, to be honest that Batman should be left as it is instead of mending it to one's liking. It's a unique story that should not be adopted for mainstream culture without mentioning the fact that events mentioned are from Elseworlds. Ben Affleck still manages to impress and has rightfully earned top spot for best portrayal of Bruce Wayne, though Batman was kinda left aside to focus on the broken Bruce.
Another thing that made this film half NAY was Superman itself. Superman sequels need to build more optimism by razing previous bars to keep viewers on their seat's edge, and this film did not give even a hint of that. Henry seemed a bit down on zeal and enthusiasm he'd displayed previously and that doesn't make Superman more likable.
Politics around it needed to be more arranged and sequential instead of random clippings thrown on screen. More organizing would've let viewers understand the confusion related to Superman's existence more comprehensible.
Lex Luthor and Doomsday were the least interesting. Jesse Eisenberg was a miscast despite his track record of giving spotless performances. Doomsday should've been saved for future films, this one could've been Bizarro or someone equally strong. Lois Lane fell completely apart much to our excitement and Amy is visibly struggling with her character at many points. They need to make sure that Lois gets worthy screen time without forcing her.
Other good parts were Gal's Diana making her DCEU debut which was amazing wit that crazy and overwhelmingly good OST defining her in minutes. Jeremy Iroms and his angelic voice made him another good Alfred and rest of the crew was good.
Overall one may, may not like this film depending upon personal preferences of genres. Watch it yourself before judging by its cover."
" Nonsensical at best, idiotic and insulting at worst
",-0.7717,-0.9552,2018-08-14 00:00:00,2,"Let me start by saying that I tought that Man Of Steel was actually a pretty good movie. I'm all into the Christian imagery and the Superman-Jesus parallel concept. I believe that was ""smart"" if I dare to say the word.But oh boy, do they miss the mark with this one. Let's start with the good stuff or at least, the ""tollerable"". Ben Affleck as Batman is OK-ish, but then again, the writers had like 10 min or so to develop his character so lets shoe in the same old rehersal story of him loosing his parents, but let's make it in slow motion so it looks dramatic even tought we'd seen this story a thousand times. Screw interesting character development, maybe people don't know who Batman is, right? From here it just goes downhill in the worst way possible.
Lex Luthor is just a Joker copy-paste and not a good one, in short, he's like Jim Carrey playing the Riddle, except he's Jesse Eisenberg. Everything he does on screen is dumb, but everything he does off screen is genius. And by the end of the film you're just left there wondering how he did everything but it doesn't matter because he makes Christian analogy, so it must be good, right?
We'll review his ""plan"" later, I put it in bunny ears because all of it is off screen because we must have a reason for Batman wanting to punch Superman in the face.
So Batman is (justifiable) angry with Superman because he destroyed a whole city district while trying to save the world. That's okay, I hope we explore deeply the inner conflict with all the people who lost their house, jobs and families in Metropolis, maybe an insurrection perhaps?. 
Oh no, there's a guy in a Wheelchair... Oh and an african lady who is scared of Superman... I guess... that's all the consequences there is for unsupervised godlike power. But don't worry guys, we just handcuffed Superman and we will put him on TRIAL so we can hear him say he's sorry.
Not for long because the whole court blew up. How? We don't know, but it must have been Lex Luthor because he said a pee joke to the judge. Meanwhile Batman is killing people with guns in a scene that's factually kinda cool. Because turns out that Lex Luthor is doing shady stuff. 
We'll go to a party to steal all his information. 
Because conveniently, Luthor has his super computer in his party summer house... behind a glass door... without a key... with no guards.... with a convenient usb port so you can steal the whole hard drive or what have you... 
You can also get away with it by saying you tought it was the Bathroom too.Moments like what I described are all over the movie, and they're so many because on top this movie is painfully long, and yet it seems like nothing happens or makes sense whatsoever. Flash appears trough a portal and he's yelling something that will matter in Justice League I guess, Batman has a dream where Superman is evil and some bug minion things are flying, wonder woman joins the fight against a poorly made CGI monster which is the biological son of Lex Luthor and General Zod from the last movie.
Then Superman dies, like Jesus Christ, get it? But don't be scared, Justice League is released after Suicide Squad.Pathetic, insulting, idiotic and completely boring."

" Such a disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.7121,2018-08-12 00:00:00,1,"So many people complaining about Ben Affleck. Me? I cried a little when I saw Jessie eisenberg's (can't be bothered to check if I have that correct) name come up at the beginning of the movie. Never seen a single film with him that was any good. He's awful. Simply awful. Cant blame him entirely or this one though.One and a half hours in and I'm begging for it to end. Quick check of the time remaining... oh hell I'm only half way...I'm surprised. Man of steel was ok. Wonder Woman (yes I watched out of sequence) was excellent. How does this steaming pile of boredom fit between them?Slow, boring, drawn out unnecessarily and not very well written.DC vs Marvel? No contest. Every one of Marvel's movies beat this, even Black Panther!"
" The film is really a dazzle for anyone who is a fan of superhero comics.
",0.3182,0.9984,2018-08-10 00:00:00,8,"The plot was not one of the big hits, but it's not weak. Ben Affleck is the best Batman in action so far, but I still prefer The Dark Knight Trilogy because it's so much more complex. Of course the armor of Batman V Superman is superior in fidelity to comics, but the most pleasant, at least for me, is The Dark Knight batsuit. The Batmobile is incredible on the scene, but I really wanted to have seen more of 'real' footage. Gal Gadot is wonderful as Wonder Woman, and her armor, with sword and shield, really fits beautifully into the beautiful actress. The somber photography lives up to the theme. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is forced, and out of his mind, and, perhaps, pleased for it. Doomsday's design is beautiful, but I'd like to see something more like comics. Zimmer made a well-placed track with the sequences themselves, and this is favorable for those watching.The opening sequence is very good, as I liked the insinuation, with the firearm breaking a collar, that material goods will never be more valuable than the lives of innocent people. The action is satisfying, and the battle between the main characters of this story pleases, until the surprising end. When Superman quotes that name, we clearly see that Bruce remembers his past. It seemed to me that Bruce thought Superman was saying that he had been afraid at the most tense moment of his life, as if he were mocking. When Lois arrives, bringing up, there is a certain thing that men are closer to these gods than one imagines. The script is great, the effect phrases told by Bruce and Luthor are really good, really, and they made me think about certain things. The cons of this film are the stuntmen in CG, who appear suddenly at that moment of action that is involved, and that even the computer-generated monster disrupts the illusion of cinema. I know I look boring, but I do not like that, really. Of course, the best action scene of the film is made when Batman goes to rescue Martha Lane, as if he was doing for somebody what he had not done for himself, because he was just a child, without strength or courage. When Bruce says ""I believe you."" for the guy who threatened Martha, he seems to remember that thugs always have the courage to kill innocent people, as he once saw himself, and he feels obliged to do something immediately, like a man made, and full of technological resources. The moment that Superman sacrifices himself, after telling Lois that he loved her, I understand a reference to Jehovah, the son of God, according to ""The Holy Bible."" At times, the feature film looks a lot like an epic story of gods, even more so by the quotes of Lex Luthor. The final moment seems to make it clear that there will be a resurrection, too. Several movies, even with fictional and unreal characters, seem to remember news stories or other stories we have ever heard.Finally, the best thing about the movie was the new movie Batman. That's what I wanted to see, a dark character, both visually and emotionally speaking. I mean talking about the mother is another matter."

" Layman review: Affleck is not the problem
",0.3089,-0.9061,2018-08-06 00:00:00,3,"I didn't bother to watch ""Batman V Superman,"" because I heard nothing good about it. But most of the criticism I heard was about Ben Affleck's acting. 
Tonight, I decided to watch ""Justice League,"" and I really enjoyed it. And I thought Ben Affleck actually did a good job as an aging Bruce Wayne/Batman. So, afterward I decided I would give ""Batman V Superman"" a shot.It was bad... I mean, really bad... but not because of Ben Affleck. It was mostly due to the atrocious story line, poor writing, and mediocre direction. Again, I don't think Affleck did a bad job. The script was absolutely horrible. And apparently the director didn't care enough, or didn't have the power to say ""this sucks, fix it!"" I'm all for suspension of disbelief during a movie (hey, dudes can fly and have super powers)! But the whole premise of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent hating each other was totally unbelievable! And then, all of the sudden, because Bruce hears his mother's name... they're best friends! :OAnd if you want to pinpoint the worst acting/casting, it's definitely Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor! Really? This squeaky little douche is Lex Luthor? Sorry, I like Jesse Eisenberg in other things, but this was a poor casting choice. Maybe he'll do better in the next one (which there obviously will be). Oh, and also to blame: the editor. Could've cut 20-30 minutes out and made it a slightly better movie."

The pacing is too slow for my liking, Lex Luthor is infuriating & this version of Doomsday was wasted.However, there is a lot to like here. This is a visually stunning movie at times. I loved the armoured batsuit and the whole fight scene. Also, the warehouse scene is the best live action batman combat we've ever had.Lex's plan gets a lot of hatred, but each time i watch this i notice something else about it. Its a great, Lex Luthor plan. It's just a shame the portrayl of Luthor overshadows it.It's not the type of superhero movies people expected or maybe wantes, but that isn't what snyder set out to do. It's just sad that we'll never see all of what he had planned for the DCEU but hopefully with Aquaman and Shazam! Better things are coming.Possibly not the movie we deserved, but a damn good one."
" GIVES US THE GREATEST BATMAN EVER!!! A BRILLIANT,DARK & ADULT COMIC BOOK MOVIE.
",0.7249,0.9988,2018-07-31 00:00:00,8,"This is one hell of a dark gloomy & very serious comic book movie!!! I really enjoy this film i don't have all the ridiculous pathetic over the top fan boy hate or the over the top unnecessarily critic venom, i simply enjoyed this as a great super hero movie with the greatest batman of all time!!!
This is a mature-grown up super hero movie, there's a dark & dangerous tone to it & there's grit & violence, this is Batman in the real world.
I totally respect a more adult comic book movie & love it for doing so!!!The actual fight between Batman & Superman is excellent, couldn't have done it any better in my opinion, it's gritty & brutal & rain drenched, the fight looks fantastic!!!
The gloomy cinematography looks amazing, Zack Snyder knows how to create a dark visual mood & look, sometimes scenes are closer to the Horror genre!!! Snyder is a visionary director & the ""Nightmare"" scene is excellent as is the mentioned ""fight scene"" & the big battle at the end is like it's own monster movie latched on, this is a great fantasy Thriller.My ONLY big complaint would be Lex Luther!!! He was TERRIBLE. Luther aside i loved BEN AFFLECK, i loved the idea when it was first announced & his performance is the best in the movie & the best version of batman so far he's that great.
Affleck's batman is an older tougher & grittier version, he's an angry man at a corrupted world, this is the real dark knight!!!
This movie is pretty much a superhero Masterpiece, it's near on a perfectly dark fantasy Thriller with just the annoying Lex Luthor character/performance as my only real complaint or dislike in the whole movie!!!
I really appreciated the much darker feel & atmosphere of this movie, a darkness we haven't seen in a long time this well done in Comic book movie, i prefer Batman vs Superman over the ""Nolan Batman Trilogy"" because here i have the best version of the Batman character to ever be filmed with Affleck's outstanding intense performance.The brutal fight scenes with Batman & thugs are BRILLIANT, exactly & finally how i want to see Batman fight!!! Everything about BATMAN is perfect. WONDER WOMAN is also fantastic in her part & SUPERMAN is Fantastic in his torn up emotional part & the big fight with Batman is AMAZING!!! the movie looks fantastic,the cinematography is OUTSTANDING & also the music is great with real emotional punch. Zack Snyder is a fantastic Director, Batman vs Superman is a fantastic film with so much good in it & so many amazing scenes like the NIGHTMARE SCENE that is AMAZING!!! watch & enjoy i did"
" An Epic Showdown!!!
",0.0,0.9969,2018-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, ""hmmmm, so who is this about?"" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."
" Snooze fest to start but has some great action scenes
",0.7684,0.4398,2018-07-27 00:00:00,7,"The film is ultimately average. It starts off extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY boring. The build up to the actual action scenes is nearly 3/4 of the movie, which consists of all talk with VERY little action. However, when all the talk does finally end, and the fights begin, they have some of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a superhero movie. The Batman vs. Superman fight is great and just about perfectly executed, Batman woops some thugs asses in an epic warehouse fight, combined with the fight against doomsday being equally if not more amazing than the others. The CGI is outstanding. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL deliver an outstanding score. I just wish it didn't take so long to build up to these amazing action scenes. I'd just advise watching the scenes on YouTube, because aside from these scenes the movie doesn't have anything else worth watching."

He spends the whole movie looking and acting like he's constipated. On top of that, in the Batman suit, he looks more like Fatman.If they'd have picked someone who could actually act and looked athletic in the suit, to go along side Gal Godot and Henry Cavill, this might have been a decent movie, but Affleck's take on Batman, left me flat, man. Had me wishing it was Batman who died in the end, just so Affleck wouldn't be around to ruin Justice League, as well."
" What a lame disappointment!
",-0.75,-0.9528,2018-07-18 00:00:00,1,"The over-hyped movie that just didn't deliver. The movie had potential and it just fell flat on it's face. Just like Man of Steel I feel the tone's too serious and uneven. The choices some the characters make are so unreasonable. Probably the worst crime of this movie is the casting of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I'm beating a dead horse here but his presence is so out of place. His role is more akin to the Joker than a calm, collected criminal mastermind. If anything maybe he should've been the Joker in the Suicide Squad (though that's a different story). Gal Gadot has an uneven presence. She's probably the only good thing in this movie along with the titular showdown we were all waiting for.Speaking of the showdown, the events leading to it just don't make since. This virtually all has to do with Clark's mother's name ""Martha"" (which's a weak plot device). While in the comics it's made clear why Superman is always in the sights of Luthor and why he and Batman clash from time to time, this movie tries to cram everything in rather than let it develop as a series like Marvel (that is if they done it right.) Luthor should've been happy about Superman's presence as he could've used him as a cash cow rather than see him as a threat. Another thing that doesn't make sense is the creation of Doomsday and his demise. How Doomsday came to be is a little mystifying as he was created by Luthor and Zod's DNA. With that being said he should appear more human rather than a monster. Also, the way Superman killed it was a little more over the top. I don't think Superman had to sacrifice himself in the climax. Overall, it's needless to say the movie was a lame disappointment. The pacing was very uneven, the actors weren't really bad but their chemistry just doesn't work (that and their motives) and while the fight scenes were great the motives behind it just didn't make since at all."
" This a joke?
",0.296,-0.8168,2018-07-14 00:00:00,4,"Superman would crush Batman! All Superman would have to do is fly hundreds of feet about Batman and either blast him with his heat vision, freeze him with his artic breath, or drop a building on him. Superman could just as earlily fly faster than a freaking bulliet pick Batman up and fly him into space and defeat him that way. So many ways to crush the bat! Drives me crazy that people argue that Batman could or would win."
" The hope of comicbook movie
",0.4404,0.8303,2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,"First of all my english is very bad so, please, forgive my mistakes.
It's strange, it's not a movie that copies a graphic novel like 300 or Sin City. It's a comics language translated to a movie and still is cinematography.
The themes come from superhero like Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Return like the infleunce of media on our perceptions about good and evil. The way a stranger is viewed with fear.
It has a fragmentary approach like comics, like a puzzle and only at the end you have all pieces to understand so you must have patience to rebuild the story.It is much more interesting than a simple comicbook movie. Maybe it's the real missing link between comics and movies and the same between blockbuster and auteur films. Where Nolan's Dark Knight try remove every comics-book aspect Snyder pushes everything into that languege seriously.
It's another way to see.Well, very very well"
" The Boldest Superhero Film of My Time
",0.3818,-0.9985,2018-07-11 00:00:00,9,"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though ""best"" shouldn't be taken to mean ""most enjoyable."" That honor easily goes to ""Thor: Ragnarok."" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch ""Superman: The Movie"" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was ""stupid"" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed ""Man of Steel"" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the ""world's finest"" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named ""Martha.""I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the ""save Martha"" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says ""What am I doing?"" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of ""Arkham Knight,"" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of ""Justice League"" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said ""no"" to taking a dump on someone else's art."

He pays close attention to detail in this movie like he did in Man of Steel, however it doesn't make this movie a masterpiece by any means. If Zack could get a guy to write a story that doesn't feel rushed in certain scenes, I think we would have a masterpiece.I liked all of the characters however Lex Luthor took some convincing.I've always enjoyed the deep layer of certain perspectives that DC movies have taken. It makes their movies more interesting to me. In BVS it's a theological approach. The tone of the movie itself was not an issue for me like many critics have discussed. The serious and dark nature of BVS is different from what I've seen in super hero movies prior to this one and, therefore, made it all more interesting for me.Deep down I want to give BVS Ultimate Edition a 7.5 or even an 8, but even I need to step back a realize this movie does have a number of issues. So I am giving it a solid 7/10."

" Unappreciated MASTERPIECE of Film - Best Super Hero Film Ever Made
",0.9416,0.958,2018-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Let's begin:First of all, don't ever disrespect this movie if you have not read nor viewed the source materials it is based upon, because it's true to its sources. Lex Luthor was always a scrawny white guy. Aside from that, it's just an absolute concrete masterpiece in film.Critics swayed suggestibility amongst the general movie-goer population that is tantalized by such inferior ""films"" of the Disney MCU. The critical consensus of this compared to Disney's Marvel's Civil War is blasphemy amongst cinema. Both films released the same year, only one film is an actual film, the other is a kids movie.Batman V Superman is not a kids movie and requires intellectual dexterity as well as competent comprehension. This film is nothing short of a master-piece. Even the theatrical version is lightyears ahead of anything Marvel has produced, and any naysaying is a clear robotic of suggestibility. This film contains great direction, performances with conviction, and most of all - it actually has a script.I feel pity for those who view this as some sort of atrocity to film - for those who do probably think The Godfather and Schindler's List are ""boring movies"", and that notion alone states you have no value or claim amongst cinema and how it is received. You don't get to pick and choose what good films are. Art tells you what good films are. If you can't sit through films like JFK, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Apocalypse Now, Casablanca, Cinema Paradiso, M, Psycho, Lawrence of Arabia, West Side Story, Chinatown, and Fiddler on The Roof - how could anybody trust your opinion on film?"
" Better than what people say
",0.4404,0.9995,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Dark and brooding. This describes both Batman and Superman. It's also very similar to how the film is shot. This colossal movie takes the opposite approach to Marvel and The Avengers, but that's pretty much how they want to compete with them anyways. A follow-up to Man of Steel, Zack Snyder is once again at the helm. I'm thinking his visual style should be the opening topic.First, let's talk about the introductory 10 minutes. The opening credits is a stylish way to bring Batman's story back, and I enjoyed how it was kept brief with only the highlight moments (if you consider a double-homicide of his parents a highlight) since we all know the story already. The slow-mo works well in opening credits, and it's certainly cool, but Snyder definitely gets excessive with it. My favorite part of the film is what follows immediately afterward-- excluding the fact that Bruce Wayne was driving a Jeep Renegade. My favorite shot as well is in the 9/11-like destruction during the Man of Steel climax, but this time from a different perspective; and as the people dash away from the rubble, Bruce rushes towards it. The entire sequence, in fact, is powerful, for the film does a great job of playing off of one of my biggest complaints about Man of Steel, the destruction. Not only does this introduce the political aspect, but it also provides sound motivation for Bruce as he is unable to save the innocents from the crashing towers. This type of storytelling worked well, and maybe Snyder tried using it more in the form of those dreams/premonitions, but the vague references to comic book story lines didn't pull through in those scenes that may have been added just to put in the trailers. I will say, the one awesome moment is in the Batcave, and off to the side is what is presumed to be a Robin costume with a message from the Joker; don't worry, Snyder, I see you being clever.All right, let's talk us some superheroes. The movie toys with interesting moral dilemmas with Superman, and I still love Henry Cavill, but the overall impact isn't there. There are some cool shots with him still: the people surrounding him with their arms outstretched, and then when he's in space with the sun behind helping to rejuvenate him. On the other side of the two-headed coin (Batman reference), I mean, c'mon, Ben Affleck is awesome. I have always been a firm believer that his directing is far superior to his acting, but don't let that take away from what he does. With the Dark Knight himself, I love the branding. I'm all for it. I was slightly taken aback, however, by the free-spirited use of lethal force employed to take out the goonies. Maybe more interaction would have me more willing to simply say bye-bye to the baddies, but it does retract a little from what Batman usually represents and is used more of a way to set up conflict with Superman. I have no issues with the bulkier suit either; it makes more sense to me as they play with this older version of Batman. Which reminds me, I wasn't as much of a fan as some of my friends were and how they will say how awesome it is, but watching The Dark Knight Returns (animated but still dark) is highly suggested to get more of a full circle of Batman. Oh, and brief shout out to Jeremy Irons. You weren't fully utilized as Alfred, but I look forward to what you will give us in the future.Now we all know this sets up Justice League. And I was the most skeptical about cheap, forced ways of introducing the rest of the lineup, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smart and to the point. Not sure how their looks are going to turn out, particularly when they get stand-alone films, but that will be a discussion for when the time comes.The other very, very smart move was having Gal Gadot be Diana Prince for the majority of the film instead of Wonder Woman even if how it was handled still felt clunky in areas. The reveal worked in to their favor. But it does leave much to look forward to with future outings.One of the issues I've noticed people have been most split on is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. The best way I can describe his performance is as unconventional. At moments he was trying too hard to bring a more psychotic, schizophrenic approach, but in the context of the film it was a contrast vastly needed.And that ties into the next topic: Hans Zimmer. When we last saw him in the previous caped entry, his dull performance led me to miss the John Williams theme. One of the best parts of the movie was Zimmer bringing out his creative soundtrack; each superhero got a unique theme, and Luthor's blend of quick violins was pure awesomeness and was a redeeming grace to every scene featuring him because it brought out the character Eisenberg desperately tried to portray.To go back to the visual style, the film is too bleak; the lack of lighting renders some scenes as less effective, like the climax I will describe later. It caused too much straining to know what was presented on the screen instead of doing something like drawing attention to details to treat the observant, smart viewer. There are moments, but there's still a feeling that Snyder had to make sure he appealed to a wide audience, so the more hopeful viewer ends up being dumbed down to size to fit with the marketing. This isn't a dumb film, but a lack of deeper meaning behind visuals doesn't do much to stretch the brain.Before we move closer to the climax, lets talk about Batman scenes versus Superman scenes. I enjoyed Snyder's use of Bruce. Sure, some scenes dragged the run time out a little, but you could tell he was having fun working with such a different character. This is most evident in the action sequences. You know what I'm talking about from the trailers when I say I loved the Batman: Arkham style fighting. As a slight downer, in one of those weird vision scenes, there's a really long, circling take where Batman tosses bad guys all around as they take him on one at a time for the most part. While the long takes are always appreciated, the delicate nature of not wanting to mess up the fight choreography did lead to a held-back effort from the stuntman and actors. With glasses-wearing Clark Kent (still find the disguise lame, but I've had it explained that donning the glasses changes Kent's entire appearance, making it full disguise-- I like that explanation more, but it still seems kind of half-hearted), you'll get your fill of Diane Lane, Amy Adams, and Laurence Fishburne; but nothing better than from Man of Steel comes out, only scenes to propel the plot.Maybe this is a slight spoiler coming in after 2 hours, but if you don't know that Batman and Superman fight and that Doomsday makes an appearance, then you're already a lost cause. Go be like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but change up the story and stay on the island. And now that I have tossed out the people that must have put life on mute for the opening weeks of the film, let's talk. This movie has my favorite use of kryptonite. It makes sense, and Batman uses such a cool array of gadgets during the fight. I will say that the fight was totally unnecessary, but if I'm like anybody that paid to see this, I wanted a fight, and a pretty darn good one I got. I also enjoy the idea of putting Doomsday in. But if you've seen Godzilla, King Kong, or even Clash of the Titans (not the laughable original, doesn't count) and its older brother Wrath, then nothing new is added honestly. Big, huge, ginormous, CGI creature with a menacing roar threatens total destruction. I guess teaming up on him can satisfy the nerd in us, but it went too far over-the-top.I am pleased with the outcome of the film, but the end has its predictable moments. If I had to summarize in one sentence, I would say that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a large improvement over Man of Steel and a very entertaining watch, but it doesn't hold the substance seen in The Dark Knight."
" The audience lost this fight!
",-0.68,0.9338,2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"It's almost unbelievable how bad this turned out, seriously how did they mess THIS up? 
Well.. the characters are all wrong: Batman who is probably the best part of this movie, and almost works, is dark, brooding and violent and with a reason for it! Although seemingly being not bothered by killing is a bit too much.. But his portrayal overall is decent and sometimes even great by Ben Affleck. The PROBLEM however is that so are the other characters especially Superman! Which means all the contrast between him and others is basically lost. 
Superman is absolutely joyless, unlikable and looks like he'd rather do literally anything else when he actually saves or helps anyone.. he is even more of an anti-Superman than he was in ""Man of Steel"". Lex Luthor is so miscast that he has entertainment value cause of just how laughably bad he is, and how ANYONE thought this is a good idea? Wonder Woman is OK, but doesn't have too much screen time and is a bit underused. The whole movie is a mess of poor choices, plot holes, bad characterization, lazy writing and the pretty cool fight between Bats and Supes is resolved by a joke that is still alive in 2018 Deadpool literally referenced it in his sequel.. This has some cool scenes, some funny lines and even a few epic moments, but it's just emphasizing how good it COULD have been.. Defines wasted potential!"

Two of the best actors still working today. At first, I called this movie a great Batman movie trapped inside a bad Superman movie, but the ultimate edition made me enjoy the Superman parts more. If you have not seen this movie, I would recommend watching the Ultimate Edition. It is thirty minutes longer, but it's also that much better. In my unpopular opinion, I would watch this before any Marvel movie (except for maybe The Avengers or Logan)."
" Good, but flawed
",0.2382,0.9819,2018-05-30 00:00:00,6,"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE is the big superhero smash follow-up to MAN OF STEEL, the Superman revamp starring Henry Cavill. Cavill returns to the role here and appears opposite Ben Affleck, who takes on the mantle of an older, wearier Batman from Christian Bale. I watched the three-hour director's cut of this movie and it's apparent from the outset that there are significant flaws with it. The story doesn't justify a three-hour running time and for the first two hours not much happens at all. The good news is that all of the best drama and action is saved for the climax; when the two heroes finally go at it, it becomes exciting, and things culminate with a city-smashing climax reminiscent of Godzilla at its most fun. I enjoyed Affleck in the Batman role here, and the supporting actors are generally good; Jeremy Irons steps into the Alfred role very smoothly, while Amy Adams gives the most human performance of the film.Zach Snyder's direction is a bit off, a surprise given he made the excellent WATCHMEN the previous decade. Like Peter Jackson in RETURN OF THE KING, he has no idea how to end his movie and it just drags on and on afte the main plot is tied up. In addition, the almost entire lack of any action for the first half of the movie is a real misstep, and the crushing gloominess of the production weighs down on the viewer quite a bit. My biggest problem lay with Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor; Eisenberg feels like he's doing his best impression of Heath Ledger as the Joker, but he's just annoying here and I ended up wanting him off screen every time he appears. Still, the CGI effects are decent, and the film is suitably 'epic' in feel at times; it's not up to the standards of the AVENGERS movies they're making now, but it's still good clean superhero fun when it wants to be."

" It's pretty near perfect
",0.7845,0.9953,2018-05-24 00:00:00,10,"Spoilers I guess,I think most of the bad reviews are people upset that Batman kills, Superman doesn't crush him, or some other part of the heroes choices that doesn't line up with the critics personal view of his or her childhood superheroes. I think they are perfect. They are realistic and behaving so, in a fantasy world. When Batman and Superman have their stand off, there are a few things one needs to understand, and on both sides. Superman is getting increasingly frustrated with humanity throughout the film. He tries to help, everyone criticisms him, or worse, kidnaps his mom! When he shows up at the bat signal, he doesn't want to fight, he wants Batman's help, but he is at a tipping point, both because of his frustration, and of course because of the precious time he has left to save his mother. When I first saw this movie I thought he jumped too quickly to fighting Batman, but now I see that he's had enough, and it's reasonable to see why if you just watch the film. And even when he starts fighting back, he doesn't want to kill Batman, you can see the inner struggle as he gets closer and closer to, but never really wanting to do it. Batman wants to kill Superman because his perception of him is so skewed with lies and deceit that Luther purposely sewed into him. He is also blinded by the vision of the future he had, in which Superman has clearly taken over the world and lost all his humanity. He doesn't see Superman as a human until the 'save Martha' scene hits him hard with the realization that even as he is about to die, Superman still just wants to save someone else. And that brings everything back into perspective. Not just 'our moms have the same name!'There are amazing and gutsy references outside of the films plot, which are meant to be in the future or in the past, especially the future vision, that I think are all perfectly delivered and mysterious enough for us to want more, but not needing it right this moment, and relevant to how Batman makes his choice to kill Superman. All of the acting is spot on, especially after watching them all reprise their roles in Justice League, which clearly chickened out and tried to be more fun and straight forward like Marvel. Same characters, much worse. No layers, everything had to be said out loud. My hope is that Batman vs Superman would be DCs benchmark going forward, and that they don't care what anyone says, as long as they stick to the same amazing vision that was present during the making of this great film."

" The DCEU Needs A Miracle
",0.5859,-0.9927,2018-05-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie is a trashfire. It does have some good elements, but it was overall a steaming pile of crap that was given no thought before being released in theatres.PROS:
When I first heard that Ben Affleck was cast as Batman, I knew that this movie was going to suck. However, Affleck was actually one of the best parts of this movie. He kicked so much ass, and I loved seeing him onscreen as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. As Bruce, he was cocky and charismatic, but as Batman... well, he beat the crap out of people (and I'm pretty sure he killed some guys, but I'll get into that later).
Gal Gadot had almost nothing to do in this film, but I did enjoy seeing her as Wonder Woman. She was really awesome. She wasn't in the movie a whole lot, so there isn't much to talk about. However, I think she'll shine a light on the DCEU.
I also really liked Jeremy Irons as Alfred.CONS:
Who told Jesse Eisenberg that the villain needed to be a Mickey Mouse impersonator? I personally love Eisenberg, but his performance as Lex Luthor was absolutely awful. Luthor has always been a serious character throughout the previous films, but in this, he's a cartoony villain with no richness in his character or his portrayal.
Amy Adams really tries to be good as Lois Lane, but the screenwriters never give her anything to do in this movie. I'm not trying to be sexist, but she was a useless character and she didn't add anything to this movie.
Also, I think that the plot is just really muddled up and convoluted. So many things just don't add up. There are even elements of Lex Luthor's plan that are so premeditated that it makes you wonder how he knew that these events would occur.
Batman's ethics also kinda confuse me in this movie. Everybody knows that Batman tries not to kill people. But in this movie, it's pretty obvious that he's killing people (considering that there's a rated-R cut with more blood and gore in Batman's fight scenes). I'm actually okay with that, but my gripe is with Alfred, who's always been Bruce's moral compass, not even acknowledging this. This confuses me, unless Batman has always been killing people. I don't know, so this isn't really that big of a gripe.
I also felt that this movie pulled out of doing something bold. In Superman's fight with Doomsday, he gets stabbed with Kryptonite and killed. This actually shocked me. I waited a while until the movie was almost over and I realized that they actually killed Superman. This was a really bold move, and I was surprised that the DCEU did that in their second movie. But then, the last shot shows Superman's grave, with dirt starting to float around it, indicating that he was still alive. Honestly, I felt that this was really cheap and stupid.
Finally, the ""Martha"" scene. Who the hell said that this was a good idea? Seriously, this is just an awful scene. For those of you who don't know what happens, Batman is about to kill Superman, but then the latter says ""Save Martha"". This is because Martha Kent (Supe's ""mom"") is in danger, but Batman flips out because that was HIS mom's name (who is obviously dead, because Batman). After this, Batman actually stops trying to kill Superman and they almost become friends. This is one of the dumbest scenes in movie history, and I still can't believe that this made it into the actual movie.Overall, BVS is a pile of crap that had its enjoyable moments, but was ultimately buried by stupidity."
" A case study of how talentless directors can mess up great potential
",0.0,0.7421,2018-05-10 00:00:00,4,"Batman V Superman is a case study example of how bad directors will always spoil a movie. 10 years ago i remember seeing 300 in a theatre and hating it. It was a bad film (maybe a good music video) and yet Snyder kept on getting deals to make some of the most ambitious movies. Other than Watchmen his films have been consistent rubbish. Man of Steel was a good indicator of how he would make a mess of something as large as the Justice League. In a movie where there are characters to be introduced, Justice League to be set up, an ultimate stand off to defined, Snyder wastes time on gimmicky plot devices like dream sequences, mumbled dialogues with dead parents, half baked story plots, and completely incoherent jump cut action!!There was a storyline, there were some good characters, Ben Affleck is actually good as Batman but the editing, the direction and some rank bad dialogues make this film unwatchable. For example you understand why Batman hates Superman but why does Superman have an issue with Batman is incomprehensible. Jesse Einsenberg is annoying as Lex Luthor.As the viral video which shows Sad Ben Affleck reflecting on how bad this film is depicts perfectly, this one takes special effort to botch up. Esp. Kevin Feige's Marvel comics world has brilliantly defined how to cram and pace narratives with multiple characters. Even Marvel's smaller entries like Ant Man and Deadpool have smashed records (Critical and commercial)Yet Zack Snyder seems to have learnt nothing about how the superhero genre has evolved. As a critic put it ""The film serves as a metaphor for its own aspirations. The corporations that produce movies like this one, and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them, have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement""There should be a fanboy movement to have Nolan or Jenkins direct the rest of the DC world otherwise this franchise is heading nowhere.There is a hard to define word that Indians call a big budgeted over hyped movie that is crap - 'Bundal'.

I was unsure how Ben Affleck would be as Batman/Bruce Wayne, but he fits nicely. If your a fan of marvel and Dc Comics then this and all the other films will be heart rendering success.There is PLENTY of awe inspiring energy with special effects and massive explosions. The fight scenes are compelling as Batman/Superman face off. However, the allure of them leading up to one another falls flat. One aspect of this film is it is way to long, which seems scenes were skipped because certain parts of the story do not add up. Zack Snyder taking the helm seems to work and it seems he has a direction for forthcoming films. I though the addition of Gal Godot as Diana prince/Wonder woman was effective, yet slightly misses the mark of needed in this film. Modern day lex Luthor with Jesse Eisenberg I thought was a brilliant mess. He is deviously fun to watch but slightly over the top. The basis of the film in fighting for what is right comes to a emotional conclusion but directly satisfying. I gave this a 7 out of 10"

 Like Man of Steel, Zack the Hack manages to get every aspect of it wrong: Superman is still moping while showing complete disregard for human life, Batman kills dozens of henchmen (just like the comics, right?), the story makes little to no sense, Lex Luthor is probably the worst villain in comic book history and Snyder still thinks it's 1999. with his obnoxious slo-mo and Jesus imagery shoved down your throat, instead of telling a compelling story.

It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

Jesse Eisenberg's acting was too over the top to the point that he became annoying (don't know if Zack Snyder told him to act like that or it was just him) Amy Adams is okay the only one I enjoyed watching was Henry Cavill as the Superman. And fnally: BEN AFFLECK IS AWFUL AS THE BATMAN! Don't listen to anyone saying that battfleck is good. It was like watching Ben Affleck tring REALLY hard and very desperately to be Bruce Wayne but fails miserably."

The visuals, the acting and the energy are all there, but rarely will the viewer know what are they talking about or what is going on.

" GREAT MOVIE
",0.6249,0.7772,2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,"I felt the need to write a review two years after the film was launched, with Wonder Woman and Justice League already out, and Marvel on the other side making great movies as Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther and Infinity on the way.I can't help but wondering why comic and superhero fans didn't appreciate this film as much as i did. I mean this film is trully awesome, what's not to like?BATMAN: Just imagine how hard it is after Nolan's and Bail's Batman for someone to create something good. Snyder and Affleck created somethin even better. Affleck was great, physically and emotionally, acting was really good, and the fight scenes... Batman vs Superman, or Batman against all in the warehouse. Have you seen anything like that before or ever again? I couldn't believe that i liked Affleck's Batman more than Bail's (respect for Christian).SUPERMAN: We all had already watched man of steel, embraced it and knew what was coming, and i mean no more Christopher Reeve (bigger respect,RIP) and less Superman smiling and saving cats from trees. Cavill was really good once again and i didn't feel for one second that he is dark. Appearing at night doesn't mean you're dark. Let's not forget that it was Batman's backround.WONDERWOMAN: And suddenly there she was. Saving Batman from Doomsday with Junkie XL's amazing score. I still have no words, and Gadot proved it on her solo movie.And then, the script, the lines, the interaction: the ""is she with you"", the ""do you bleed"".
And what about the final battle, they all teamed up, every one did his part and Superman killed Doomsday (by the way, also good). And then he died.The purpose of this review two years after the movie is just to state that we comic and superhero fans waited for long to live this era where serious creators make superhero movies and it is really ungrateful to not just love this movie. I can only put it equal to Avengers (2011). That great. 
PS: All this negative opinions and reviews resulted in a very anxious Justice League."

An astonishing movie that begins in the middle, heads in no discernible direction and obfuscates throughout.It would probably have been understandable on mushrooms or brownies. As it is it is the perfect example of why DC comics productions will never EVER come close to Marvel studios. In ANY way imaginable. How very apt that it was produced in part by 'Cruel & Unusual Films' for, trying to sit through three hours of this (even in my living-room), was nothing short of cruel and unusual pain. Superman, as in all previous installations, is a dweeb come super alien. Uhm, this will never work, folks.

" Saturnine superhero showdown
",0.0,0.6505,2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,"A bleak and bitter Batman, feeling that the world would be a better place without Godlike alien heroes, decides to fight the Man of Steel. The film is very dark and grim yet oddly maudlin in places, for example: despite Batman's apparent intent to beat a kryptonite-weakened Superman to death, the pair miraculously bond over the shared name of their mothers and become friends and allies. This reconciliation is a good thing, as super-villain Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has turned on a Kryptonian monster maker, and now a doughy-looking ""Doomsday"" is terrorising Metropolis. Henry Cavill is fine as Superman and Ben Affleck makes a bulky, tough-looking Batman (whose growling voice I quickly tired; the aforementioned mothers' name epiphany is a good example of why). Amy Adams makes for a photogenic Lois Lane although her impractical (but very complimentary) shoes seem out of place of on a 'women of action'. Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is easily the worst character in the film, with a grating 'jolly psycho' delivery that comes across like a knockoff of Heath Ledger's now legendary take on the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"". Diana Prince/Wonder Women's (the gorgeous Gal Godot) cameo appearances are great (unfortunately, they are (IMO) better than her 2017 eponymous film). The film is slow in places, suffers from the typical plot-driven inconsistency of super powers (Superman's super-hearing being a good example) and the final 'climatic battle' looks like all the other 'climatic battles' in recent DC/Marvel adaptations. Watchable with some fine CGI work, but not memorable."

Cavill is a great Clark Kent/Superman but with the writing and direction he's been given I feel like he's being left in the dust which is really disappointing. Surprisingly Ben Afleck is a great Batman, and I really want to see more from him, Gal Gadot gives a great Wonder Woman intro and the visuals are really well done. Now the bad, the story is so overloaded, which wouldn't be a problem if it kept us interested which it doesn't, we want to see Batman and Superman interact and fight but we hardly ever see this on screen, the films tone is also needlessly dark and Eisenberg's strange and off performance as Lex Luthor feels stranger every time I watch. In conclusion, a film that should've been better feels very meh, it's still gives us what we want just very little and very emotion less, all in all the film is average and dull."

His take on the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight is unique in comparison to previous interpretations of the characters in live action whilst being faithful to the comics such as The Dark Knight Returns.
This movie was a perfect sequel to Man of Steel and set-up for the team up of the Justice League.
I love the way the themes of the movie reflect on realistic issues happening in the world right now and the dark tone of the film makes it feel grounded and right for the events to me."
" The worst (or second worst) superhero movie ever made
",-0.6249,-0.9879,2018-04-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie... is awful. I've never understood why some people love it. Well, Blind DC fanboys may love it just because. But it is such a terrible experience that could have been great. It ruins 2, no, 3, actually about 5 to 6 of the greatest characters in comics. Batman is completely in the wrong and unlikable. Superman never has a clue about anything. And Lex Luthor is the biggest tragedy. He is my favorite comic book villain and this movie made him a carbon copy of Heath Ledger's Joker, but without the charm, charisma, and acting talent. 
It's depressing in many ways. The plot is depressing and it makes you depressed from watching it. Way to much cgi, and it's not even that good of cg. Doomsday looked so awkward and bad. There are several plot holes that ruin any decent idea that the movie has. I love these characters and I wish this movie had done them justice. But alas, it didn't. This movie is an injustice to anyone who ever loved these characters. It may be the worst comic book movie ever, or the second. Electra was pretty bad, but at least a Jennifer Garner gave it her best shot. Cavil acts like a cardboard box. Eisenberg is terrible. Ben Affleck does fine but he's already a talented actor anyway. Sadly, his talents were wasted with the worst version of Batman ever. Wonder Woman is the only saving grace of this movie. Don't watch this train Wreck!!!"

There was so much about it that I didn't understand I scoured the IMDb to read the user reviews, which suggested that the extended cut cleared up many of the problems with the theatrical version. I watched the 4K disc extended version this afternoon. Not a good idea.... Although it did help clear up some of the things I didn't understand, it just shows what Warner is doing to the DCEU. They should have stopped making Superman movies after they reacquired the property from Ilya Salkind. Superman Returns (2006) was not great, but a decent movie and I would like to have seen Singer's planned sequel, but things really went south for me when Man of Steel came out. When the Salkinds wanted to darken the product a bit and bring in some of the other characters from the DCEU, Warner & company blocked them and said fans don't want to see Metropolis turned into Gotham City and Superman fans don't want to see a darker (in tone) Superman, but that is the exact thing they have done. Henry Cavill is a skilled actor who looks good in the suit, and Ben Affleck was a much better Batman than I expected, but the rest of the film is a disjointed mess. The visuals in some cases are worse than in the 1978 movie. CGI is a great tool but it is so overused, not just in this film but in nearly all of today's films I wish they would just go back to wires against a blue screen. During the fight with Doomsday the entire sequence looked like a cartoon (it was). I know there are many who really liked this film but I am not one of them. I finally found a Superman film to knock ""IV-Quest for Peace"" of the Superman cellar. Tonight I'm going to see how low they can go 'cause Justice League showed up from Amazon today."

" The biggest definition of a trainwreck
",0.0,-0.9735,2018-03-23 00:00:00,4,"I´m sure Snyder´s target audiences are adults . He has shown passion and enthusiasm that he wants to do movies for them. There´s no need to focus on a genre targeted to children and teenagers. It´s almost like Warner brother ignored how polarizing Watchmen was in regards to characterization,dialogue and pacing,yet they chose Zack Snyder´s philosophy as an inspiration . I don´t meant to be mean with Snyder. He has a passion for cinematogaphy and an purpose: to entertain a specific audience. but I´m sorry. he has publicly announced his own egocentric position on how movies should be made :""I feel like Batman and Superman are transcendent of superhero movies in a way, because they're Batman and Superman,. ""They're not just, like, the flavor of the week Ant-Man - not to be mean, but whatever it is. What is the next Blank-Man?""
.
The movie is not very action oriented and more oriented to themes as depression and responsabilities. when the action comes,its too short. their characters don´t smile or have normal conversations but instead they speak Christopher nolan´s dialogue.It´s sad for the actors because it´s a relativly well acted movie: Ben affleck shows the sadness a character of batman is known. Gal gadot´s voice is mysterious and seductive. Jeremy Iron´s bitterness gives some laughs. My problem goes to Henry Cavill,whose interviews show a charisma that demostrates he could be such a great superman if his character wasn´t written so joylessly. But let shoot this elephant in the room,Jesse Eisemberg. 
 I´m might be in the minority who didn´t enjoy his character in the social network,but his acting was fantastic in that one. that didnt make any excuse for warner brothers to cast him as a villain. The dialogue they gave them are unnatural and the writers confuse insanity with evilness, when a suave, calculator personality could work.
 Batman V superman is one of the most depressing experience i had. Not as a comic book movie fan,but as a person.I felt empty. It didn´t bother me they tried to be dark in tone,but it annoyed how unsensitive it was to its audience during the 151 minutes. it was a product too somber for kids , too heavily dialoged for teenagers and too incoherent and dense for adults."

What stopped him from just sneaking into lexcorp and taking the cryptonite?

Ben Affleck as Batman was way better than I ever could have imagined it to be. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is my perfect woman. And Henry Cavill returning as Superman is just as good as Man of Steel.The actual fight between Batman and Superman is dope, but it makes no sense why it actually occurs.

" A failed attempt in every regard. Incredibly disappointing.
",-0.7778,-0.9955,2018-03-07 00:00:00,3,"It took me 3 days to finish this movie. That alone should tell you everything you need to know, really...This movie is not only shallow in regards to its plot, but manages to destroy everything that was good about 'Man of Steel' and 'The Dark Knight Trilogy'.
Its mere existence stains these movies and their splendid portrayal of both Batman and Superman.For the life of me, I can't relate to any of the characters nor their motivations in the mess of a film. It just makes no sense that Batman suddenly decides to take on Superman, that he brands him as the dangerous bad guy who might or might not be the end of the world. Honestly, the scene in which he was talking about how good, powerful people will or might, at one point, turn evil was ridiculous. Maybe he should have just eaten a bullet himself right then and there. Maybe he should just kill every single person on earth, because you never know who might turn out to be the next evil mastermind. Superman's motivation is no less incomprehensible. Weak motivation seems to be a theme with this movie...Don't get me wrong, I really loved Batman in the 'The Dark Knight Trilogy', but the Batman portrayed here? Not so much--that is to say, not t all. He was unsympathetic and his motivation, his aggression towards Superman, was rather incomprehensible. Superman was somewhat more likable, but nevertheless I fail to be able to reconcile both Superman and Batman with their counterparts in the aforementioned movies.
The writers, directors, producers--whoever--really didn't care about the franchise, didn't care enough to flesh out the characters, to build up a background story that would lead to the kind of animosity between Superman and Batman that they want to convey to the audience. There's just no compelling reason for them to fight each other in the first place! It's rushed. There's certainly no effort put into the storyline. It's just some good(ish) visuals, okay CGI effects and action scenes (although the fight scenes with Batman were terrible beyond belief) strung together that are trying very hard to distract the audience from the otherwise lackluster attempt at a movie. The disconnect in this movie is palpable.And let's not even get into how Lex Luthor fits into all this. I'm still wondering about what he contributed to this particular movie, other than recognition value. Someone must be the supposed antagonist in a comic movie, I guess. This film's Lex Luthor is ridiculous and painful to watch beyond words. Hell, the Lex Luthor from the TV series 'Smallvile' was genius compared to this.
Again, no explanation, no reason is delivered for his evil master plan of pitching Batman and Superman against each other. 
Dear DC people, take a look at 'Captain America: Civil War', take a look at Zemo and his motivation --that is how it's done. Because despite all my doubt regarding the whole 'let's make superheroes fight each other!' theme, it was done really well in Civil War.Same with Wonder Woman--what was her purpose in this movie?? It really feels like they put DC characters willy nilly into this flick.Of course, calling a movie 'Batman v Superman' and then have the main plot (I'm being generous calling it a plot) of the movie about another fight altogether in the end doesn't win any cookie points either. Furthermore, and I stand by this: no way would Batman ever manage to beat Superman! That's just stupid. Also, why kill off Superman this early in their franchise?? I was under the impression that DC was trying to jump on the success train of the epic superheroes franchise that is the MCU.How anyone can make such utter horse sh.... with that kind of budget is beyond me! Christian Bale did a very smart thing when turning down the offer to star as Batman once again!The only good thing I can say about the movie is that I didn't spend any money on it and only watched it when it became available on Netflix.Another reviewer summed it up pretty nicely, and I'm taking the liberty of borrowing their line: Not BvS, just BS!Honestly, I'd much rather watch any given Marvel movie or series for the 100th time than suffer a 2nd time through this mess."
" Average movie not poor...
",0.0,0.9832,2018-03-06 00:00:00,5,"""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is an action fantasy movie that continues from where ""Man of Steel"" ended. In addition to this, we watch the general public who is concerned about Superman and his existence on Earth and his connection with ""Dark Knight"" - Batman. The public let Batman attack Superman and at the same time, Superman tries to understand and find out the truth about Lex Luthor who is a millionaire criminal mastermind and wants to fight Superman for his own reasons.I expected more from this movie as most people did. In this movie, there are too many galas that make the audience be bored by it and so, much action. I liked the fight between the two characters which wasn't something extraordinary but it was a decent fight and nothing more. I liked the interpretation of Ben Affleck who played as Bruce Wayne / Batman and I have to admit that I was very cautious regarding the change of the actor of Batman from Christian Bale to Ben Affleck and I was surprised that Ben Affleck was very good at it. I liked also the interpretations of Henry Cavill who played as Clark Kent / Superman and Gal Gadot who played as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman. I didn't like the interpretations of Amy Adams who played as Lois Lane and Jesse Eisenberg who played as Lex Luthor. Zack Snyder makes an average direction with too much darkness as most of his movies and many lightnings. To sum up, I have to say that ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a $250 million average movie and nothing more. It's a movie just to spend two and a half hours and if you have high expectations or hopes about it then it would be good to reduce them because otherwise, you are going to be disappointed by it."

Having being years for its wait, the anticipation leading up to its releas was relatively heavy. Overall the film is a dissappoinytment on many levels, as by now fans and critics have pointed out. It feels like too much of a long film. Apart from featuring approximately the numerous screen incarnation of the murder of Wayne's parents, it does mercifully away with most of Batman's origin story, as it was done better in Batman Begins. Batman v Superman feels at most times overall boring and lacking of suspense of any thrills. The characters don't seem as much into it, as should have been. Superman as a character lacks any energy as Henry Cavil seems to be on audio pilot. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is decent, though his portrayal and voice as Batman is what ruins it. Christian Bale did a much better portray as those Christopher Nolan Batman films were overall more constructed with better writing, directing and overall structure. Jesse Eisenberg was miscast as Lex Luthor as his tone is far too over the top compared to the other characters. We understand the character is a crazy villain, but it doesn't work well here. As for success, this film as a success as expected, though general speaking it is a bad/disappointed as it has been claimed.

It has Christ imagery that would make the Matrix look subtle by comparison, and sloppily tries to explore the themes of omni-benevolence vs omni-potency. It would be clever IF Zach Snyder wasn't five feet up his own ass and had any talent outside of adapting comic books panel by panel. Because of this, people who want to use the media they consume to make themselves to appear more intelligent without actually looking for truly thought provoking films will flock to this movie and claim everyone who doesn't like it is a ""brain-dead retard"", something that I've actually been called just for criticizing it. There are many, MANY other problems but the movie has rightfully been torn apart by critics in those regards so I won't go into detail. But this film's (and I don't use this word lightly) pretension makes the dumb mindless schlock far more unbearable by trying to make itself meaningful in the most shallow and sloppy way I have ever seen."

It seems that everyone has their own opinion of the movie. I have heard on good authority that the Directors Cut is better than the theatrical version. I have only seen the latter. While there is a strong cast and very well done visual effects, the transitioning of scenes was very confusing and the execution of what they were going for failed miserably. I would argue that multiple scenes with Batman were extremely questionable. For instance, Batman does not ""brand"" the bad guys that he captures. Also, the ""scene"" of Batman buying kryptonite in a sort of gangland cartel deal is just plain weird for the genre. I wouldn't necessarily say that this movie is dreadful, but it certainly did not live up to the hype that preceded its premiere. The biggest fault in my eyes was poor writing and directing."

1. when he fights Batman he could simply stop him from doing anything, and tell him what was going on... didn't he had the strength to do so ?
2. well, after being hit by a ""smoking kryptonite bomb"", he keeps attacking like a foul like Batman could not have another trick like that one...

4. when Luthor blackmails him, couldn't he just simply crush the guy bone by bone until he revealed his mother's whereabouts... (well it would be too easy, but this reveals a weak story anyway)...
5. on the final battle he stands way too much time near that kryptonite spear... probably because of that, his brain's probably stopped and he could not find any better solution than to fly directly to the monster on a body to body battle...and being as killed as he could...So, Superman is treated like an idiot, but how about the offer of an entire spaceship and the mortal remains of General Zod to Luthor ? How idiot could that be? Yes, Luthor plans where created in a world where everyone is an idiot, and therefore, this could be more than a movie full of idiotic situations...Not everything is bad: the visual effects deliver (without being stunning), and Ben Affleck and Jeremy Iron's performance are a bit better than the remaining (i could not say the same about the dreadful Jesse Eisenberg who seemed to try to repeat the Heath Ledger success on ""The Dark Knight"" (which was in my opinion, not worthy of all the hype and acclamation he got by then)...This movie should be called : ""Dawn of Idiotism"""
" The most under-rated movie in my recent memory.

It is a tightly packed movie with almost every conversation between characters helps in the character development and teasing us about the future.After some years this movie will definitely set a bench mark for Superhero movies, even though it has some minute errors regarding the plot.Many complaining about the tone of the movie but unfortunately that is how DC is differentiated from Marvel. DC will give us ground to earth reality in the fictional world on the other hand Marvel gives us entertainment. If DC make lighter movies as of Marvel we will hate DC saying that they copied Marvel. If they made movies as of now, with serious and darker tone the haters are complaining about the tone. Believe me, no person in the world, it doesn't matter how much powerful he is, will crack jokes in the middle of war.This is how a movie has to be, instead of just accepting the existence of super movies, which will never happen in real world, this movie debated the whole concept of existence of super heroes mainly Superman.As far Superman is considered he is the most physically powerful character, then the only way to make him suffer is to break him mentally and psychologically, that what Zack has done. On the other hand Batman was already broken man with the death of Robin in the hands of Joker and realized ""the world makes sense only if we force it"".And major issue everyone complaining about is Martha. Batman didn't stopped killing Superman because both of their mother's have same name. The reason behind it is he figured out that even Superman , the alien, have the human mother when makes him realize that superman is also human. And sees his helpless situation during his parents murder in the Superman who is pleading to save his mother. And the name Martha just acted as a catalyst.Some are complaining that is not Batman V Superman just Batman and Superman, actually it is ideology of Batman V ideology of Superman, not the ultimate gladiator fight. This ideological differences between ""the son of krypton"" and ""the bat of gotham"" is going to resonate and echoed in the future DCEU movies which is clearly shown ""Knightmare"" sequence where The Flash warned Bruce about the coming disaster with the heel turn of Superman due to the death of Lois Lane.The music department lead by Hans Zimmer has done a fantastic job. The music defines the darkest zones of the Batman and Superman characters and the intensity in every scene especially the Wonder Woman scene.If Warner Bros. wouldn't have involved in the way of Snyder, and let him release the 3 hour cut this movie would have easily crossed 1 billion mark and would have been a great start for the DCEU."

They keep watching these forced plots with such amaze and keep giving acceptable ratings to mislead neutral viewers like me. And I am not a particular fan of Ben Affleck, and even more so of him as Mr Wayne, so it was an even more no-no for me.

" A Bad Place to Start From
",-0.5423,0.8621,2018-01-25 00:00:00,4,"For DC to get their cinematic universe started with the introduction of more superheroes, they decided to begin with a rivalry between Batman and Superman, two of the most beloved comic book characters of all time. To say the least, this movie is a mess. Why? Well... Ben Affleck is a terrible Batman, it's boring as hell, the story is extremely convoluted and takes multiple viewings to understand, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is quite possibly the worst casting decision of all time, it tries way too hard to be dark and edgy for its own good, they didn't make it clear enough that Batman was pushed over the edge, it has plot holes the size of the hole in the ozone layer, they completely wasted Doomsday, and the ending was just a massive insult to comic book fans everywhere. Perhaps the most egregious thing was the movie's trailer (attached to the Force Awakens, for everyone to see), which was loaded with spoilers. Here we see the two of them teaming up with Wonder Woman to fight Doomsday. First off, in a movie literally called Batman V Superman, showing them teaming up constitutes a massive spoiler. Second, Doomsday is known for one thing and one thing alone, so if you know the comics, you knew what was coming months before the movie came out. It's not the worst movie ever, and it does have some upsides. While Affleck's portrayal of Batman wasn't very good, he made an excellent Bruce Wayne. The beginning, where it's the ending of Man of Steel from Bruce Wayne's perspective, was pretty cool. But to start a universe, like what The Avengers did, this was not nearly enough. Even though Man of Steel isn't exactly the best comic book movie, a good movie that brought multiple heroes together is what could make the DCEU more enjoyable. Alternatively, a solo Batman movie that made it clear the Justice League was coming together would have done the trick. I know it was only 4 years after Dark Knight Rises, but unless those movies were going to be brought in to the DCEU (which wasn't going to happen anyway), they would have needed to reboot Batman again. What should have happened was a solo Batman movie that introduces Diana Prince (but saves her action for her own movie) that hints at the Justice League coming together, then Wonder Woman, then Justice League. Sky's the limit from there."

Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

It has the tough job of reintroducing/shoehorning a new Batman (Affleck) into the 'Man of Steel' world (even though the tone's darker, like Nolan's Batman films), with Bruce Wayne driving around Metropolis during Superman (Cavill)'s big fight with General Zod from the previous film. Why? Not sure - he just appears reckless. We also have to see Batman's parents die again - must be at least the third time on film...The film tries to blend together two popular graphic novels - 'The Dark Knight Returns' from the late 80s and 'The Death of Superman' from the early 90s - with varying degrees of success. I wish it had more of the former, but it instead almost makes Lois (Adams) the main star and puts her in the middle of everything. There's heaps of political manoeuvring and ""is Superman a risk or not?"" with Lex (Eisenberg) and a Senator Finch (Hunter), but it all takes 90min to set up and there's finally a pay-off, but it leaves a lot of action that needs to be squeezed into the final hour.I didn't like that Gotham was right across the harbour from Metropolis (a la San Francisco & Oakland), rather than hundreds of kilometres distant as it's supposed to be. Batman has a few too many dreams/visions for my liking... However, the score's great, Irons was good as Alfred, but underused, as is Perry (Fishburne). FYI, there's no after credit scene, so don't bother sitting through the extra 5min! When they get to the big Doomsday battle at the end, and Wonder Woman (Godot) joins in, it is pretty exciting and eventful. A good film, just not spectacular."

This movie actually worked for the first 90 minutes. The ingredients were there, from Zimmer to solid performances to a slow burning plot. But then Snyder's attempt to pull everything together just plain failed. Characters stopped acting logically, the story stopped making sense and we reverted back to rampant destruction again. It is tough to care about stories/characters that feel like they are being fast forwarded; then again, a super hero movie should not require 3.5 hours. Better than Man Of Steel, though!"

It just doesn't work. That's like putting Ryan Reynolds as Adolf Hitler in a documentary about WWII. You just can't. You can't take the movie seriously because it just seems like a big joke. The action and soundtrack is pretty decent in this movie, that's why it is getting 3 stars, but those are the only good things about this.

I liked Affleck's Batman, but hated that he was a moron, subject to a lot of Dramatically Convenient Stupidity(tm) which dragged the story toward the inevitable Superhero Showdown! As such, the peripheral characters were a lot more interesting than the putative leads. Alfred (Jeremy Irons) sarcastic asides about Bruce Wayne's mental health and social life made him feel like a real character. Holly Hunter as a crusading Senator was equally compelling. And yeah, Gal Godot's Wonder Woman made the entire film, that's no lie.Is it as awful as you heard? Probably not, but it's painful to see the missed opportunity for a good film. They were also handicapped by trying to ""make the entryway film to the DCU!"" by shoehorning in unnecessary cameos of heroes yet to come. The far more entertaining (critically and commercially successful) Wonder Woman seemed to have learned from B v. S's failures, and made a single movie that still managed to be open to other adventures and possibilities.And, that being said ""Justice League"" was a huge improvement, and worth watching, as well."

" Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice - Review
",0.5267,0.998,2017-12-04 00:00:00,6,"This is a movie that fans like myself waited since... well, almost our entire lives, the idea of DC's greatest heroes showing up on the same movie seemed like an impossible dream back in the day, but thanks to the MCU, DC finally decided to give it a shot. Now, just like MoS, I have to say, this isn't a bad movie, specially not a 26% movie like RT thinks, this film has plenty of good and even great things, but it does have many flaws, first the good, the cinematography, Larry Fong is an excellent cinematographer and some of his best works are with Zack Snyder, and this is no exception, Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL once again did an amazing job with the score, Ben Affleck was amazing as Batman and most of his scenes were fantastic, specially his first introduction and the warehouse fight, once again the story here seems great, however, what holds it down... is the script, yeah, we start with the bad here, the script is by far the biggest problem with the movie, some dialogues don't make sense, even after I re-watched this film 4 times now, and character motivations and actions are either unclear or... kinda silly, I really feel that DC should have hired someone else to write the script, David S.

" The Bell Cannot Be Unrung!
",0.0,0.9963,2017-11-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie's major problem is twofold: first, it is the first Batman movie succeeding Nolan's wonderful Dark Knight trilogy which is, mildly speaking, hard to compete with. Second - and this is, in my opinion, the more severe problem - it is not an easy movie. I want to explain why this makes Dawn of Justice exceptional, where I see issues, and why I consider it the best superhero movie of the last few years.Apparently, BvS deviates from the typical Hollywood cooking recipe for blockbusters. There is no villain in this movie, instead the main conflict(s) take place within the two characters, Clark Kent alias The Superman and Bruce Wayne alias The Batman. Snyder presents us a very sinister version of Bruce Wayne, who has spent many years fighting crime in Gotham and who has become bitter over it, and all his bitterness is just about to turn the virtuous fighter for justice he once has been into a nightmarish and ruthless vigilante. Clark Kent, in the meantime, is having a hard time being the Superman. He has to learn that all his actions have consequences he is not able to anticipate, and that not everybody is grateful for what he is doing. All in all, not much space left to be a hero - for both characters. To make it all worse, there is a third character, Lex Luthor, who also has issues with Superman (and with his own sanity, actually), and who is pulling strings in the background, trying to push Superman and Batman into the final confrontation. Exciting premise!The storytelling focuses mainly on the escalation of these initial conflicts, while at the same time it paints vivid pictures of the characters. Nothing feels rushed, every scene has its place and its message, and besides Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent themselves, various side characters fill the movie with life and soul, most noteworthy Lois Lane and Wonder Woman. The storytelling is another example of why this movie is not easy: the plot is not fed to you in little pieces, you actually have to pay attention and think. Some scenes cannot be understood immediately and only make sense later in the movie, or they can but they require you to make connections yourself. As a result, plot- and character-developments feel very natural. This actually adds a lot of intensity to the movie and allows you to dive deep into the events you are watching without anything feeling artificial.BvS is already great due to what I wrote before, but what makes it really awesome is the score. Oh, how much I love the score! Such a fireworks of atmosphere and tension. The whole score builds on two main themes, Superman's and Batman's (surprise!), and two side themes, Luthor's and Wonder Woman's. Each title is woven around one of them, making the whole soundtrack sound like it is telling the story for itself. It perfectly fits the atmosphere created by pictures and dialogues and gives the characters and scenes that last touch of personality. In some scenes, I even feel the sound mixing has gone too much in favor of the special effects, putting the music in the background when it reaches its epic climax (e.g. Metropolis being devastated by the Kryptonians, or the scene in which Batman wreaks havoc at the port).I also enjoy the absence of jokes and situation comedy, since I feel it would rid the movie and the characters of their depth and would make the core conflicts seem irrelevant. The movie lives from its darkness and heaviness and fits Superman and Batman well. Superman because it it turns him from the uninteresting sunny boy he usually is into a conflicted, quite human adult who is experiencing the complexity of the world he is living in. And Batman because, you know, he is Batman... If you were to make a movie out of a Scott Snyder comic or out of The Dark Knight Returns, you wouldn't make it a comedy, right?The actors' performances are great without exception, a lot has already been written about this topic, so I won't go any deeper than saying that Amy Adams excelled all the other actors who were already great. A lot of people say that Jesse Eisenberg overacted his part, and while I can very well understand that impression, it did not really bother me. He gave the dark and actually very quiet atmosphere a touch of craziness and bizarreness without scratching its seriousness, so I quite enjoyed his scenes.The one actual issue I have with the movie is Lex Luthor's character development. The process of Luthor racing down the madness slide is fun to watch but at the same time not well told. I suppose it is the lack of focus on his character that makes especially the creation of Doomsday in the end a bit incomprehensible. One word on the most notorious scene from the movie (""Martha!"") - I have read a lot of comments making fun about this scene, dismissing Bruce Wayne's decision to spare his opponent as being ridiculous. If you watch the movie, follow the portrayal of Bruce Wayne closely, think about the scene, try to understand his decision and I'm sure you will get what is really going on in this important moment. Little hint: it's got nothing to do with anyone's first name being Martha. So, I hope I gave you an impression of why I really like BvS, and why I prefer it over most other comic adaptations. I really hope that the DCEU will develop towards a movie adaptation of the Injustice story line, as foreshadowed in the apocalyptic scene in the middle of BvS's main plot. I know, no other DC releases have reference this scene yet, but I still have hope. Injustice: Year One in the tone and atmosphere of BvS (and with a comparable score!) would blast me straight out of my cinema chair."

Batman can think beyond the appearing things(not like normal superheros)(he will not fall for cheap tricky deviations or cunning thoughts of villains) that's what makes him an ideal superhero but in this movie he's a guy like hit nd run type, no second thoughts, just hit and run. I always admired his ideal characteristic behaviour, there is no other super hero who thinks like him. In this movie they spoiled the character of batman. I hate this movie, very much disappointed.The climax is most worst part of the movie, they can easily make batman as the killer of monster by using the kryptonite grenade gun and the spear instead of superman handling it.

He did not capture the essence of Lex's character at all and instead came off as an idiot.Ben Affleck did alright at his part, but I felt he isn't a good enough actor to depict such a complex character. This was made all the more obvious whenever Jeremy Irons was on the screen as Alfred. Yet, I felt Jeremy Irons was miscast as Alfred. His character felt off.After the first hour or so the story becomes boring and pointless. There's just one action scene after the next with little reason for them to be fighting or detail on what's going on.There's also a lot of unnecessary political junk in this movie. For instance, there's a scene that clearly mimics Katrina victims on top of houses who apparently can only be saved by Superman.What's unfortunate is that I felt this could have been an above average movie, something to kick start DC movies and the Justice League forward. The premise was interesting. You effectively have mankind rejecting Superman and similar super humans. They reject being dependent on them. This appeals to me and it's why I prefer Batman in the DC universe. However, the story has too many threads going on for it to be easy to follow. Later in the story, not enough is explained and you are pushed too quickly into ""the final battle""."

Instead of making a film worthy of metaphors and symbolism, we get a film that doesn't even understand how to be a film. Instead of focusing on the internal conflicts of Batman or Superman to flesh them out more and make them seem logical in their deductions, we have Easter eggs made into subplots and even made into the stupidest parts of the main plot. Doomsday, Wonder Woman, and the Justice League set up drag this film down more than anything else because the film should be about the clashing of two heroes with different ideals. Instead we have this gigantic mess. The dialogue is horribly written, the CGI is of the same quality of the CGI in Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones. The acting, except from Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons, is dull. There isn't a real thing about this film I enjoyed."
" This is What Lacking!
",0.0,0.805,2017-11-27 00:00:00,8,"When Batman V superman came out. I felt disappointed, I wasn't expecting such kind of depiction of batman and superman, although superman wasn't a big concern at all and I also believe that Zack had done one of the best work on Superman, ergo I couldn't blame or criticize Henry Cavil as a superman. But me and other DC movie fans were not ready to accept Ben Affleck as the Batman, also showing this peculiar dark-sided Gotham Knight which was also hard to digest because we never had seen Batman in such a manner who didn't hesitate to kill any bad guys and I also didn't like the costume (I still don't like the costume). In my opinion things which lacked in this movie was the good depiction of Batman...we weren't introduced with this character in details like Christopher Nolan did with his Batman ergo I didn't feel connected as an audience to the Batman...he always seemed stranger on the screen..his signature style was lacking...he was just looking like a rich superhero with a lot of features and accessories but Batman seemed missing for the audience and the only reason was that we never got properly introduced with Zack Snyder's Batman. Our mind still stuck with Christian Bale's depiction of Batman. second thing, Theater Version of this movie was actually very very disappointing whether you know this Batman or not..but apart from this..once we get settled for Ben Affleck as Batman...the movie is good (certainly can get better) but It was one of the best movies from DC world (the extended version of Batman v Superman not theater)...If we break these pointed barriers I would say It was a great movie..Doomsday Superman Batman Wonderwoman LexLuthor....Bang Bang boom-boom."
" Watch the Ultimate Edition
",0.0,0.4404,2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"This is a review of the Utlimate Edition, and which I rate is as 10 out of 10. For me, BvS Ultimate joins Dark Knight, DK Rises and Logan as among the comic-movies I give the perfect score to; just so you know my sensibilities. However, I feel that a very real argument can be made that BvS Ultimate Edition is in its own league as being THE sole super-hero movie ever made.My premise is that it has reaction to the Superman - the fantastically alien, ubermensch or God - as its main text. Simply put, no other film does this as its main subject and theme as BvS does. And the Ultimate Edition (i.e. Zack Snyder's full three hour+ artistic treatment) is a brilliant exploration of the theme.It is the Ultimate Edition which is great. If you've only seen the theatrical cut, then you miss out on the storytelling which acts to balance the movie. Essentially, Bruce is given pathos and pity in his perspective in the UE's longer opening that provides such a balance. Luthor can be seen as more masterfully manipulative of both Bruce and Clark, and Bruce's real pathos and pity gives way to tragedy. Meanwhile Superman remains himself and is the subjected acted upon not only by Luthor's evasive deceptions but also thematic conversations of where and if the superman fits, and is 'good'.Importantly, the UE also includes a Lois Lane investigative reporting thread that uncovers Luthor's manipulations but she just cannot reach the self-doubting Superman. The tragedy plays itself out, and Luthor remains out of the clutches of The Fourth Estate, and ahead of the branches of Government that serves to define the 'good' (relisten to Holly Hunter's speech for that note).In all, the humans - Bruce, Lois, the pluralist branches of Government, and even the contemplative/uncertain side of Clark - are shown to have agency in UE, and Luthor manipulates them ALL. Masterful. And then plunge into tragedy, based particularly on Batman's pathos. I have thought since film riffs on The Dark Knight in a big way, if someone was present to 'But Luthor cannot win...'The first half of Snyder's UE present all of these swirling agencies that focuses into what ultimately happens. I love this movie and I consider it THE only real super-hero to have ever been made. Please watch the Ultimate Edition before judging this movie. Also please sign the petition for a full Zack Snyder extended cut of Justice League, godwilling."
" A deep and intriguing development of storyline and characters... to follow-up with a disappointing endfight
",-0.4939,0.8964,2017-11-24 00:00:00,8,"After having watched ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" in the cinemas and just now having watched the Director's Cut, I can already say this: if you have 3 hours to spare, be sure to watch the extended version instead of the shortened one!To start of with, the much surfacing critique on the movie concerning the 'dark and gritty tone' of Zack Snyder is absolutely nonsense. This because the tone is one of the reasons that make this film shine. You place the concept of a Superman in a modern day world, and what happens in the movie could be a real life scenario. The old and hardened Batman doesn't trust this guy. Very good set-up and this flows naturally from the events of the previous film. Batman is introduced as he should be. I like the colour palette of this film a lot because it strengthens the pessimistic point of view of both the heroes throughout the movie. And also because of that's what a (partly) Batman movie colour palette should be. The movie builds up quite slow, but a sublime scenery and astounding camera shots still have the ability to make you sit on the edge of your chair while waiting for the big clash.But a fairy tale doesn't last forever. After a long build-up and a magnificent fight between Batman and Superman, the whole movie goes to ****. A slimy troll tries to take down the trinity of superheroes and the fight is just over the top. I know you can't just flush this movie down the toilet for a crappy design of Doomsday, but hey, my eyes also want something I guess. At least the Director's Cut gives us a good and satisfying ending following the death of Superman. It needs time to really have its impact.I give this movie a 8 out of 10. I do not blame Zack Snyder for this, but with a little more effort this could have been a 9 out of 10. It's a shame the movie didn't fall into the likes of the general audience, although I don't get why this is. This surely was an enjoyable film."
" More Memorable than Most of the MCU
",0.0,-0.9859,2017-11-22 00:00:00,8,"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: ""what if I watched BVS again"". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said ""The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel"" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, ""Martha"" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9986,2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is a 2016 epic superhero film, starring Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel himself, and Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader. The film takes place approximately 18 months after the events of Man of Steel, which was a polarizing film, to say the least. While many people saw Superman as a hero to the point of being a painfully obvious messianic figure, others saw him as a threat to the very existence of humanity. When a bombing occurs at the Capitol building, resulting in the deaths of millions of people, this convinces the Dark Knight that Superman needed to be put down once and for all.To be honest, I found the film okay. It's not a good film, nor is it bad; it's average. What I don't like about the film, however, is that the film tries to hard to be dark. In fact, it's dark to the point that it could turn off potential DC Comics fans. Take Batman for example. Not only does Batman kill criminals in this film, but he also has the tendency to brand his enemies. Batman is also hellbent on killing Superman, though you could excuse that, since he thought that it was ultimately for the greater good. Superman himself apparently has no qualms about killing anymore, since one of the first scenes that we see of him concerns him smashing an African terrorist through several walls. Sure, the terrorist was holding Lois captive, but it just seems that Superman could've tried a nonlethal alternative to apprehending the terrorist. As I had mentioned before, the Christ symbolism is overly present in the film to the point that it could get cringe-worthy.Another issue that I had with the film was that its plot didn't make too much sense. For example, the Flash appears to Bruce in a dream, which seems odd, as the two hadn't met yet. You also learn about other superheroes via Lex's files, but they don't add much to the film in the slightest. While you could say that they were building up to an upcoming Justice League film, it only serves to make the plot more confusing. In addition to this, it overindulges in action scenes; several of these scenes would result in massive collateral damage that would most likely result in the deaths of billions of people. I mean, seriously, who's going to pay for it? It's practically trillions of dollars in collateral damage.I also felt that the ending was too long. What I mean is, that it had some moments that it seemed like everything was going to be wrapped up, but it just keeps going. The film is by no means annoying, but I just felt that they were drawing the ending out for all its worth. This reminded me of the ending of Return of the King and how it seemingly didn't intend on ending.Now, for the big one: Doomsday. Before the film was released, many people were speculating that Zod would become Doomsday, a supervillain that was explicitly created to kill Superman. A nigh-invincible entity that was extremely hard to kill, he was first introduced in Death of Superman, which, as the title indicates, concerns Superman dying after his battle with Doomsday. In Dawn of Justice, Superman sacrifices himself by using the Kryptonite spear to stab Doomsday through the chest, while Doomsday in turn pierces Superman's chest with his spikes. Superman was seen as a hero by a majority of the American citizens, but he's actually to be buried at his hometown of Smallville, Kansas. Since Clark was often described as a simple man, it would seem that he would've wanted it that way. However, Superman was brought back to life through a contraption known as the regeneration matrix, so this may indicate that Superman might return at some point. For now, Batman and Wonder Woman decide to find other superheroes, just in case a bigger threat were to befall on the Earth.Overall, while I did like the film, the film was far from perfect. For one, I just thought that they overdid the darker and edgier nature of the film that it could turn some viewers off, it seemed that you had to be a hardcore fan of the DC Comics to get the references/plot of the film, and most of the characters were unlikable. I would recommend watching it, though don't expect a masterpiece."

And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."
" It's battered you with so much blatantly unnecessary filler and otherwise dull trite that even when the two eponymous heroes have their face-off, it bitterly disappoints.
",-0.7003,-0.6307,2017-11-19 00:00:00,4,"'Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice' is a long, tiresome and tedious mess of a film that's almost impressively incoherent, especially when it comes to its tenuous character motivations and appallingly flimsy narrative structure. It's also brazenly boring, an issue that has nothing to do with the flick's tone as some have suggested (though it is, at times, a bit dour). The only somewhat entertaining sequence that comes to mind is one that involves Batman beating down a room of thugs at the start of the third act, but by that point the flick has battered you with so much dull exposition and blatantly unnecessary filler that you aren't engaged enough to properly enjoy it. While the plot then proceeds to plummet into the absurd, visually-confusing trite known as its finale, more-or-less every other scene feels like it's running on a treadmill and very little of consequence occurs during the insanely long run-time. You're just sat back in an almost comatose state while you watch seemingly every other character aside from the two eponymous heroes (though one gets much more screen-time than the other) go about their irrelevant business until the action finally kicks off and proceeds to bitterly disappoint. 4/10"
" A dense, exciting and possibly bloated deconstruction of the genre.
",0.4939,0.988,2017-11-17 00:00:00,8,"""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is an attempt to continue the ""Man of Steel"" story while expanding the DCEU and introducing a new character rendition of Batman as the two characters collide with one another in a clash of the decade. Zack Snyder helms this massive and ambitious superhero epic while exploring the ideas of what is a hero, and navigating the complex characters of both Superman and Batman. Even a year later, this film is still talked about and picked apart by those who love it or hate it. It remains one of the most different comic book films to date because of its non-formulaic story and intense approach to its subject matter. Regardless of the praise or complaints toward the film, there is something in the film for anyone to enjoy and it's a must see for any comic book film fan. Snyder and Terrio tend to draw on multiple sources for inspiration including his previous adaptation of ""Watchmen"" from 2009. Both are deconstructions of the superhero genre and strips the characters down to their essentials with strengths and weaknesses. There are even references from both films which creates the argument of giving ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" the title of a companion piece to ""Watchmen"" both in themes and aesthetic look. Unfortunately, what makes ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" less accessible to most of the public is its highly layered and dense story. Those who aren't as familiar with the comic source (the majority of the viewing public) will find particular themes and ideas expressed. Since there are also many separate subplots that can distract from the underlying story, the film can feel messy and unfocused. Performances were great with the exception of Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor who portrays more of a Riddler or Joker-like character. While his character's psychology was brilliantly written and memorable, it's sometimes difficult to watch without cringing or wondering why the strange gimmicks. Ben Affleck as Batman proves to be understand the character of Bruce Wayne with passion and depth unlike previous renditions of the character. Henry Cavil continues to create a solid characterization of Superman while exposing the character's confusion and concern about who he is. Zack Snyder teams back up with his ""Watchmen"" cinematographer Larry Fong and what a great decision that was. As expected, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a beautiful looking film with excellent camera composition and balanced yet stylized color echoing Snyder's visual style everyone's come to expect. While speaking of aesthetics, the visual effects and production design are quite staggering considering its large scope and frankly difficult nature given the genre. At the end of the day, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a memorable and epic superhero film with great characters and exciting action. With character arcs and and layered subplots, this film is well worth the time. It's execution for this layered script won't sit well with many but it is a great ride from the beginning to the end."

" Not Nearly As Bad As People Will Say (Watch the Ultimate Edition!)
",0.484,0.9372,2017-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Note: No spoilers until indicated.When it comes down to it, yes, Zack Snyder is a second unit director who, whether he thinks so or not, prioritizes visuals over story cohesion. And, yes, that's reflected in the CGI-laden Batman v Superman, as it was reflected in Man of Steel. It's certainly flawed, but it's not flawed enough to make it seem like the trashfire of a film that other reviewers seem to say it is.First off, Batman v Superman corrects some of the flaws that Man of Steel had. One particular gripe I had with Man of Steel was the fact that the final fight scene was unnecessarily long, cliché, and destructive. Batman v Superman immediately corrects this by making this as a plot device that motivates Batman to turn against Superman. Suddenly I like Man of Steel more now. The scenes are depicted, for once, with the right amount of emotion to set up the pace for the film (it won't stay consistent, but we'll get to that later). Just to add on this, Man of Steel had too many fights in major cities that caused unnecessary destruction, Batman v Superman now has fights on uninhabited islands! Perfect!As polarizing as it may be, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor is wonderful. Instead of the ruthless Lex Luthor we're used to in the comics, Chris Terrio managed to modernize his characterization into the socially awkward, but incredibly intelligent, Silicon Valley-esque tech giant we see in this film. Many of the film's events orchestrated by Luthor perfectly illustrate his sinister characterization, sometimes without even needing him to be on screen.Zack Snyder's direction, once again, brings a less-than-cohesive film plot that seems to jump between the tension between the main characters and superfluous action. It tries to pack so much into so little time, and the result is the odd pacing and underdeveloped characterizations and scenes that are slowly becoming Snyder's trademark. I'd compare him to McG and say that this film focused too much on being visually a comic book and less on a graphic novel, with underdeveloped characterizations and scenes that needed to be fleshed out longer. Zack Snyder is still trying to find his right pacing, and it's not working yet.That said, Batman v Superman has one of the best action scenes in comic book film history. Zack Snyder, again, a visual guy, knows how to direct many of the complex action sequences the film portrays, and executes them beautifully, so I'll give him that.I HIGHLY recommend watching the Ultimate Edition; it helps even out some of the pacing and narrative flaws in the original. The narrative is still a bit messy, but it was already messy to begin with. However, the added footage adds much more to the plot and helps answer any unanswered questions viewers of the original may have had (see spoiler section below).Overall, Batman v Superman is not nearly as bad as critics or fans may say. Is it perfect? No, it has noticeable flaws. BvS tries to pack in the standards of a Christopher Nolan-brand superhero movie with the action spectacles of a Marvel film; the result is a visually aesthetic comic film with somewhat decent characterizations and scenes, at the compromise of its pacing and overall development.For opinions on some spoilers:SPOILERS BELOW:The ""Martha"" issue is totally blown out of proportion. Batman doesn't ""suddenly become friends"" with Superman just because their mothers share the same name, the name only served as a trigger that halted Batman from killing Superman. That gave him just enough time to realize that Superman was also more ""human"" than he ever imagined, and that there were even bigger issues at hand rather than just killing Superman. The Ultimate Edition adds in more details that makes the plot more cohesive and less ""intuitive,"" so to speak. If you want to know what the Ultimate Edition adds to the original, here are some key details:Additional opening scenes that add further detail on how Lex Luthor was able to place the blame on Superman for the village's destruction. Clark Kent's investigation of Batman's vigilante practices, which further motivates him to confront Batman (Adds more detail to the significance of the Bat Branding employed). Lois Lane's investigation of the bombing at the Capitol, which answers any questions viewers of the original cut may have had."
" I can see why everyone hated it, but I liked it
",0.2732,0.9953,2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Let me start by saying I am the biggest Batman fan in the entire world, so much so that I would give Batman & Robin a 6/10, which says a lot. This isn't a great start to post-Dark Knight trilogy era Batman films, but it's adequate, and I can't help but love it it Batman is in it. I'll start my review with the flaws. I thought Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther was an awful choice and he was way too over the top. He wasn't very intimidating at all and seemed to be spewing a bunch of irrelevant crap the entire movie. I also thought Amy Adams was utilized way too much in this movie. Yes, she's a great actor but if you insist on giving her so much screen time, make a superman spin off about Lois Lane (which I wouldn't watch). Most of what she did in the movie didn't seem to contribute much to anything and seemed like a pointless subplot that, if removed, would've shortened the movie by a lot, which would have been okay. Also, there's the obvious one: the misleading title. I was expecting a bunch of all out battle royales between Batman and Superman, but instead they fought for about 10 minutes and then immediately made up because Superman's foster mom was captured by Lex Luther (on a side note, I think it's really funny that Batman and superman both had mothers named Martha. Bob Kane and Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster probably should've fixed that, since crossovers were pretty much inevitable from the get-go, whether it be on paper or on the big screen, making for a world of confusion). I also didn't like the design of Batman's costume all that much. Now the positives of the film: I loved how the movie was scattered with Easter eggs, like the Justice League members' cameos, the Riddler question mark and Jason Todd's murder by the hands of the Joker. I really liked Wonder Woman, and I think Gal Gadot portrayed her beautifully and made for a pretty bad-ass superhero. The movie was also littered with great, memorable moments among the many flaws and sub-par scenes, like the actual battle between batman and superman, Bruce Wayne's dream, the aforementioned cameos of the other Justice Leaguers, the introduction of batman with those two police officers, as well as the interactions between Alfred and Bruce. I also really liked the casting choice of Ben Affleck as batman. Unlike basically everybody, I wasn't skeptical and had a lot of high hopes and anticipation to see him don the bat suit. Overall, a pretty good movie. I guess the best way to describe this movie is that it's a sloppy and messy film with incredibly memorable moments"

There is no way you can ignore the numerous flaws that the film possesses, but there are also a lot of enjoyable elements in the film as well. What I'm implying is that BvS is distinctly average. Much of the story feels tedious, but the spectacle nearing the end of the film is immense. The action is overly stylish, but the plot is practical and coherent. Zack Snyder has directed a film with positives and negatives in equal proportion. For example, the performances; Ben Affleck is surprisingly compelling as Batman, providing a layered portrayal of the caped crusader. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is also immediately charming, and Jeremy Irons makes a decent Alfred. Contrastingly, Henry Cavill's Man of Steel is once again soulless and uninteresting; I find his Superman too dull and dark, much like the film's tone. Jesse Eisenberg is horrifically miscast as primary antagonist Lex Luthor-there haven't been many villains which induce less fear than Eisenberg's eccentric take on Superman's nemesis. Lois Lane is also very character deprived, as hard as Amy Adams tries to fix it. Snyder's direction is a mixed bag; sometimes it's too arty, other times too CGI filled, but other times well handled. Tone is a major problem, which I am pleased that the people at DC have attempted to correct with Justice League, because the film is just too gloomy. You go to see films to have a good time, and tonally BvS defies that purpose. The film is also overstuffed with potential plot lines; I believe the studio gave this movie too much to do. Overall, a little disappointing, but still full of great spectacle to enjoy."
" Unenjoyable although well-crafted and terribly hard-to-follow
",-0.5574,-0.9978,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"Why nobody liked this movie: It ""kills off"" Clark Kent, Superman, and Jimmy Olsen. It should have been titled ""Superman v Luthor-Dawn of Doomsday"". Why does Lex Luthor have hair or is this the younger son of Lex? Please don't ask me if I wasn't paying attention, as this is a horribly twisted and dark entry in the very confusing saga leading up to The Justice League Movie. I barely saw Cyborg and Flash. Was the Superhero ""not seen since 1982"" Aquaman in suspended hibernation? Watching it on PPV made if difficult to navigate back and forth to double-check these things. So here's what I do know: The super-villain Doomsday is a ""Frankensteinian"" resurrection of Zod with a bit of Luthor's blood added to the ""witches brew"". Doomsday is (almost) mindless and Gargantuan in size. He is radioactive and regenerates tremendous (electrical and nuclear) energy. Being of Kryptonian origin, he is almost impossible to kill except with a Kryptonite tipped spear. Wonder Woman does manage to hack off a limb (or 2) of Doomsday along the way. The basic story is that Superman, being Godlike but not perfect, is unable to save everyone all the time and is ""framed"" as the killer in a disastrous war. Lex Luthor, as always, is the antagonist. He convinces the world leaders and Batman that Superman is an evil alien and must be stopped. So Batman tries to kill Superman with all the world watching. Yeah, yet another climax with 2 superheroes battling each other. Remembering that Batman is human, how he avoids death at the hands of Superman defies all logic. Better ""love"" scenes (not explicit) between ""Clark"" and Lois than most Superman adventures. The whole thing is exhausting to endure and painfully over-long at 2 and a half hours. It's very dark and somber. The ending is so depressing, as both Clark Kent and Superman are dead and buried. Lex Luthor goes ""mad"" in prison, of course. Superman will undoubtedly return, as the dirt on Clark's casket starts to ""levitate""..."

Now i do think it gets a lot of hate then it has, the story does have potential like i said but it then starts to make no sense. Im giving this a rating of 7/10 not bad, not great, but just an overall decent film."
" That is a true shame!
",-0.1511,-0.7551,2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,"So I just watched the movie and it's a 6/10 at best, which is really disappointing because by now WB/DC should know better. all the narrative problems and bizarre characterizations from the Man of Steel are still problematic to the narrative. the editing is confusing and Jesse Isenberg's Luthor is appalling! I had such high hopes for the movie and the DCU especially since I really like Cavill and Affleck in this, but I fear as long as Snyder and that hack Goyer are still involved in the Universe it's going to be perpetually mediocre. That is a true shame because there was so much potential for these movies to have been great.﻿"
" The ultimate edition nailed it!!
",0.0,0.9893,2017-10-30 00:00:00,8,"It's more than weird for a movie lover to watch a controversial film such as Batman V Superman a whole year after it's been released, but I guess it is the best thing that I've done so that I can be able to judge it neutrally, and frankly, I loved it. The ultimate edition really dazzled me, it had minor imperfections but in general it was very good, very clear, in order and very fluent passing from an act to an other in contrary to the commercial version which lacked of clearance and skipped important parts in the story. I guess what kept the people from liking this movie is the very dark tone it's been given by its director, who apparently has got something for slow motions and bullet cases. Another thing that I liked is the loyalty to the comics, I mean they literally took Batman out of the comics and presented him to us, something that should satisfy the die hard fans, I guess. In the end I think that the ultimate edition is really worth it, and I guess half an hour can really make a difference."
" Unfair Hate
",-0.7783,-0.9724,2017-10-30 00:00:00,9,"Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie I don't understand why does the movie have so much hate. I really feel sorry for Zack Snyder if he reads these reviews on this site.Like with Man Of Steel this movie had really good special effects, acting, and action.Okay, there were a few drawbacks like less action but the last fight scene was just awesome with Doomsday. I was even in the cinema yelling ""DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY"" when he was getting created however it is a shame he only roared.Ben Affleck is a worth successor over Christian Bale as Batman and Gal Gadot was really good as Wonder Women and she continues to shine as the character in Wonder Woman 2017 which will be reviewed soon.My favorite scenes were when Batman says to Superman ""Tell me do you bleed!"". The actual fight scene, the opening scene, and the final battle.But warning ahead there are a few scenes what might make younger audiences jump like when Bruce visits his parents grave and when he has a dream.Overall an awesome movie I even went to see it with my sister. Don't listen to the morons writing bad reviews they are just jealous."

" humiliation
",-0.5719,-0.8318,2017-10-20 00:00:00,4,"No major blockbuster in years has been this incoherently structured, this seemingly uninterested in telling a story with clarity and purpose. It grumbles along for what feels like forever, jinking from subplot to subplot, until two shatteringly expensive-looking fights happen back to back, and the whole thing crunches to a halt. That Wagnerian final brawl is exactly what you want in a film called Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice – but it doesn't come close to compensating for the blithering chaos that preceded it. The first hour in particular is so haphazardly assembled, I honestly wondered if a reel had gone missing from the projection booth.Don't wanna point out other flaws of it,cause it makes me sad and disappointed"
" Not up to expectations, but not terrible
",0.5157,-0.8953,2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"This is not a good movie honestly. I am not going to argue with you at all on that idea. However, this is not the worst movie ever. Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons are both great at this movie. And Eisenberg was actually not that bad in comparison to the other parts in the movie. But there was the million plot threads and the whole useless Wonder Woman thing that ruined the movie for me. I know that she was considered to be cool in the movie. But she was boring and useless in the movie. The entire movie is filled up with things that are great but then filled up with things that just in general suck. So in the end it sort of cancels each other out to being a just okay movie. Although my dad really hates this movie. Especially the bathroom scene."
" Outstanding cinematic experience - I loved every thrilling minute of it!
",0.906,-0.9343,2017-10-14 00:00:00,10,"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say ""clumsy"" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: ""Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us."""
" Lazy writing, useless characters,dream sequences, emails, random unexplained moment that don't get answered
",-0.6486,-0.9896,2017-10-11 00:00:00,5,"First off I don't think Zack Snyder's a good director, he should be a cinematographer. He has scenes that are visually stunning but they don't tell you anything important. They show shots of Superman doing random hero acts when they could be fleshing out Batman or Wonder Woman. And Lex Luthor is not Lex Luthor from the comics, it's his son? It's just Jesse Eisenburg doing an impression of the Joker, such a waste of a character and an actor. His purpose for hating Superman is because he hates God for not saving him from his abusive father, I think? The flashback/ dream sequences become easily irritating. You think something interesting is happening and then...nope it was all a dream. There's a scene with the Flash and I was the only one who knew watching this scene because I watched the JL TV show growing up. If you didn't, it will never be explained by the end. Lois Lane is such a useless character in this movie. She's Superman's girlfriend living with him. She investigates an unusual bullet tied to Lex Luthor and then...nothing, it's never mentioned again nor does it effect the outcome. Then she moronically takes the last bit of Kryptonite and dumps it into a random pool only to get trapped and get Superman to save her and get his one weakness she dropped into the water. Wonder Woman's in here. If that seemed random, it will be watching this.If you didn't know who Wonder Woman was going into this, you'd have no idea who she was after the movie. Also Bruce Wayne sends her an email with other superhero footage in them. Why? To set up the next movie. Doomsday is a major DC villain who is in this movie for ten minutes.They battle him, everything's rushed, he dies while killing Superman. If you knew who Doomsday was going into this, you probably expected the death of Superman, no surprise. Only scene I liked was when Batman saves Superman's mom. No dialogue, just pure action. It was rushed, confusing to people who don't read comics, and is purely here to set up the next Justice League movie. Again, Snyder makes things look great, but he can't put a script on the screen. Overall...meh."
" I had to watch it a couple of times to make a far judgment
",0.0,0.9828,2017-09-30 00:00:00,6,"I would say that BVS is good but don't watch it with high expectations. Zac Synder knows how to bring emotion and realism to the big screen. Its not perfect and honestly a bit rushed as they trying to take on so much to make an epic film. They tried to fit every related story into one leaving some plot holes and I reckon because they wanted to jump the gun and get a head start with the Justice League project. Although some scene aren't as great, there are scenes that are amazingly portrayed and having said that I would still recommend it to everyone. The title of the film is false advertising as there was hardly a fight between the heroes. The reason why we love these stories is because each one was its own individual story. it focused on its own story and allow the audience and the fans to get invested. Marvel did just that, they took their time and gave each individual story the opportunity to speak itself. The ending could be a bit better but overall I was happy with it."
" Mortal vs immortal, a modern think
",0.25,0.9667,2017-09-29 00:00:00,10,"For years, I've read enough critics on the plot, and the mixture of multiple comic stories. Indeed the background information in this movie is plentiful; it borrowed ideas from many DC book that those non-big-fans including myself has to do a lot of researches after watching this movie. And that is probably one negative impression that I could possibly think of. Another one is probably I don't like the characters call Superman god.The key in this film come to this question: who is the mortal, and who is the immortal? The most impressive scene was shot at the evening party while Clark Ken was looking upon at Bruce Wayne with helpless sight. In the heroic world, Superman is the immortal. Compare with human, he is unbeatable; he lives a much longer life; and he can fly! Batman, However is just a human with armors. On the other hand, in the human society, Bruce Wayne is the immortal. He is rich; he has done social networking well; he had more money and resource than 99% of the population. As Clark Kent, Superman does not have such more money or resource; he works as a journalist and has a girlfriend; that's everyone in the theatre can get. Superman cannot use his power to earn such more money; building wealth is a completely different skill.Speaking about ""save Martha"", I don't know why many people laugh. Perhaps they got too used to the M-style non-brainer fights. At lease the screenwriters did not make a new name to one of the moms; yes, the characters share the same names since they were first created; and I think it's total okay to make use of that.Like most of the DC stories, DC wants audience to put more thinking to the stories. The Superman in this movie is no longer like the one in the first movie. And that development raises this questions: if the Superman really exist in the modern society, where does he find his place? He can fight substantial enemies, but could he win a political debate? He can fly, but can he operate an air company? He is unbeatable to hot or cold weapon, but what if his enemy is monetary or political power? Of course, action fans won't think this far. Again, DC stories are generally not just for act pleasure. If you really think harder, this can be a deep movie to enjoy."
" What?!?!?!?!
",0.0,-0.877,2017-09-28 00:00:00,5,"WHAT THE HECK!!!!! In what universe would Batman ever beat Superman. Superman could kill him with one punch, take him to space and leave him there, laser his head off you get the point. They made a pointless film, the only reason Batman stood a chance was because he had a spear with a Kryptonite head to it. Whoever thought it was a real good idea should've kept it as an idea I mean come on think about it logically the only reason Superman didn't kill Batman is because he is 'the protector of the earth' he didn't come to earth to kill everyone. Like look back at the film when Batman tries to drive the Batmobile into Superman who is stationary! The Batmobile bounces off him, while Superman doesn't move the Batmobile flies off into a building and bursts into films, this is furthered by Superman ripping the door/roof of the Batmobile and pulling Batman out. What chance does a mortal man stand against an almost demi-god."

No need to mention that Jesse's Lex being too far from the comics but also after the death of Heath Ledger followed by his tremendous Joker act; Jesse Eisenberg could be the new Joker we would love to see with all those nutcase gestures. They should really really save him for the new Joker."

",0.6696,0.5296,2017-09-20 00:00:00,10,Ben Affleck did an excellent performance playing Batman. Although Christian Bale wasn't good enough but Affleck is even better. I've watched it in the theater and I watched it on DVD. It blew my mind away. All the fighting scenes between Batman and Superman was intense. The Man of Steel versus the Dark Knight. It's nothing like I've seen before. The first two Batman films by Tim Burton is still close to my heart but this one is superb and dark. I can't wait for Justice League.
" An under-appreciated superhero film
",0.0,-0.217,2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."
" Excellent production, story has flaws
",0.5719,0.9368,2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"***Lots of SPOILERS*** For one thing I am sick and tired of the representation of public backlash at superheroes which is becoming so common in movies by both of the major comic franchises. It may be realistic of how some would react, but guess what - all these superheroes are totally unrealistic, so who needs this realism. I don't want this trash in my fictional superhero stories.So much of this movie is wasted either on this paranoia, or in attempts to counter it. And even the intellectual Bruce Wayne falls for the paranoia. He becomes even more firmly entrenched after Superman shows him a quality that would be impossible in the type of person Batman considers him - mercy.Funny how the end of the movie is opposite of the beginning in the sense that the death of Superman is almost universally mourned on a level due to heads of state.The other major story flaw is how quickly and completely Batman changed his attitude to Superman. The entire movie hinges on this. True, his reverence for his mother is built up heavily in early scenes, but his about face is practically a world view change, as fundamental as his sense of justice, and occurs in seconds. Such a change is ludicrous. Hesitation perhaps, but not a complete turnaround.The dream sequence was so surreal that it was fairly obvious that it was a dream.A Kryptonian ship with incredible technology is programmed to turn itself and its technology over so easily to a human? And the subject of the climax to the movie, Doomsday, we have no hint of for well over half the movie. No hint.Fortunately, some of the early plot also does two things that are of interest. We meet Diana Prince. And we begin to see small pieces of the foundation being laid for the League of Justice. Diana is too much of a small piece of the story to rescue this movie from the flaws, but her impact for the better is far beyond what is could have been, maybe even should have been. We are already getting hints in this movie of the blockbuster that is to come summer of 2017.The climatic battle with Doomsday is great stuff as we'd expect in a comic based movie. Of course Wonder Woman was awesome. It was odd to me how superhuman she was, practically indestructible. At least a couple of things we see in this movie aren't clear until we see Wonder Woman.Diana makes a comment at the cemetery which is so true about the real world in a macro sense. ""Man made a world where standing together is impossible."" This is even truer in 2017 than it was when the movie was made."
" A thoughtful superhero movie for those who love DC comics
",0.7783,0.4807,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"I watched the ultimate 3 hour cut of Batman v Superman, and despite how horrible I heard it was really enjoyed it. As a huge lover of frank miller's the dark knight returns, batman in this movie was awesome. Superman (who I usually find annoying) feels human and relatable he tries to do the right thing but it doesn't always work. I loved Lex Luthour in this movie he was the funny villain to the dark and depressing heroes. My only complaint would be that Batman had zero character development in this movie, and wonder woman appears for 5 minutes and I don't get what people loved about that scene,all in all I would recommend if you're looking for a more thoughtful superhero movie"
" Is this movie deserve the Golden Raspberry Awards ?
",0.4588,0.9603,2017-08-31 00:00:00,9,"I went to the theater to see this movie with high expectation. Leaving the theater slightly disappointed. The movie overall was okay and enjoyable. They were CGI for most scene and it was beautiful. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill did a wonderful job. Jesse Eisenberg was quite new and fresh for Lex Luthor's role. While Amy Adam 's Louis Lane role feel quite out of place. But the story was easily forgettable and quite confusing . I found myself got lost at some points. Turn out the one that they show at the theater was cut down 30 min by WB. So I find and watch the ultimate edition because I want to give this film another shot. Turn out the director's cut way better and enjoyable and more fit it, the whole story make sense. Zack Snyder really got the vision. Maybe you love it, maybe you hate it, maybe you want to give it a chance with the ultimate edition, maybe you not, But before you decide to love or hate it. You should see it first and have your own opinion."

But like i said, the movie was confusing, the cut scenes were so quick, e.g Batman scene *cut* desert scene, it was too fast and confusing. If you wanna watch this movie, because of story line I advise you not to watching it, but if you just like Batman, Superman, cool effects etc. it's a great choice.^^"

Meanwhile Batman is dispensing his own justice, and is branded a vigilante. Batman views Superman as a threat to humanity, and Lex Luther is happy to fan the flames...I wasn't expecting much, but was initially pleasantly surprised by this movie. The background was interesting, and the whole ""Clark Kent meets Bruce Wayne but they don't know they're Superman and Batman"" interaction was intriguing.However, this quickly unraveled. Superman fighting Batman was always a preposterous idea, both in its likelihood and inevitability of the result. The logic and events behind them confronting each other is incredibly contrived and lame, and the fight and its result even more so.From then on it's just your usual comic book movie CGI and fight scenes, and even more mindless than normal, if that was possible. Well, the director is Zack Snyder...you weren't expecting any substance with that rather expensively generated style, were you? Throw in a script that seems written by a 10-year old and incredibly irritating acting by Jesse Eisenberg and you have a pretty poor movie. The only positives are the performance of Ben Affleck and the appearance of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Even Affleck at times seems unable to believe the crap he's forced to do and say..."

The whole movie is a build up to that, where we see the most bad-ass creature come alive and wreak havoc, almost unstoppable.The final fight is good to watch, and also the main fight between Batman and Superman earlier on is good too. Apart from that, there's a few interesting scenes here and there, but it does move slowly, with a lot of fragmentation and ""what's going on"" scenes. I don't particularly like the mix of Batman and Superman in the one story, it doesn't seem like a good fit to me.I can understand the negative reviews, and I would also give this less than 5, but the final fight is massive and worth the wait."
" Okay movie, pleasantly surprised by the actors
",0.7096,0.9923,2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"I guess it was an okay movie. I am not totally impressed by the story. It kind of sucked that the whole movie pretty much was all about Batman hating Superman and Superman trying to prove that he is a good guy. And than all of a sudden they are best buds. And, oh, there is Diana Prince. Don't know where she came from and what she is doing there - but here she is and look at that, she is Wonder Woman. That part did not jibe with the rest of the story - at all. On a positive note, after having watched ""Man of Steel"" and this movie, I can say that Henry Cavill makes a pretty decent Superman. Amy Adams, though, still does not really make a good Lois Lane. There is something about her that does not sit right with the character of Lois. As for Ben Affleck playing Batman - I was pleasantly surprised how well he fit the role. After first hearing that he was going to play Batman I was all like: no way, those movies are going to suck. But he surprised me. Going to have to watch The Batman now. He is looking really good with the bit of grey at his temples and nicely filled out all over (gotta fill out that suit, LOL). More mature than I remembered him. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the upcoming movies!"

As Batman he was a bad-ass, probably the best-looking Batman that we've seen so far and I can't wait for his solo movie. Congrats Ben!Henry Cavill as Superman was fine, nothing special, he served his character well. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was a pleasant surprise, I was really happy to see her in this movie and she was great, even if only for some brief moments. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor ... I don't think he was bad, but he was definitely not good. He tried to go for that insane personality and it didn't work out, but he was still very good on some scenes. He was OK, I guess.The fight was incredible! I loved it! All of the action in this film was fantastic which proves that, even if a movie is amazingly good- looking, ... It can also be a total disaster.Zack Snyder seems unable to tell a story, there are a lot of problems with missing pieces here and there to justify most of the actions that are fundamental to the film. There are things that just don't make sense, the second half of the movie felt like I was watching a different film! Lois Lane is treated like an object. She has something, then she loses it, then she has to go back for it, then she falls from a building, then she's drowning ... She's, without a doubt, a character that needs to be in this movie, but it seemed she was there just ... Because.Another problem I had with this film was the lazy set-up done to the Justice League movie: there's a scene where Wonder Woman receives an e-mail from Batman, with info on this other superheroes that will be part of this group we all know about (they even designed the logos of each superhero! WHY? Who gave himself the trouble to design some logos for a top-secret association? ON AN E-MAIL?!). It's so forced, it's the lamest set-up ever done ... It seemed like the movie stopped for advertising and then came back to continue its story, it didn't make any sense.There are two main issues that I still need to discuss, one of them is my only problem with Batman in the whole movie: HE IS KILLING EVERYONE! Why?! He's killing people all over the place, exploding them against trucks or shooting them with a machine gun! Zack Snyder completely forgot Batman's moral dilemma, he was always that guy that was on the edge, but would never dare to cross it. The Joker played with him so much because Batman constantly refused to kill him, he was not a murderer! In this movie, he has no problem with it and there's no explanation throughout the whole film. Of course, I know why he changed, we all know why (Superman killed a lot of people and there's also other arcs from comic books that explain this), but they never show a scene to justify his actions.The other one is about the ending (no spoilers of course): they go for the bold ending and then ... They back off. It's not something that people will talk about, but it messed with me because this movie had everything to be an awesome piece of art. It wasn't because they didn't take the right decisions when they needed to and they didn't give a backstory or a justification when it was mandatory.There were a few more problems about Superman's motive to fight Batman and some other details that were solved or improved in some way in the extended edition, but I have to say that, even if it wasn't a bad movie, I was disappointed by it (especially with all the hype before its release).MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" How did this get made?
",0.0,-0.4145,2017-08-04 00:00:00,3,"This is bad on many levels. It's inconsistent, it creates a story line that isn't compelling and is poorly constructed. Not sure how anyone could rate this above 5 stars. Mainly it's just boring. The idea of Batman V Superman is bad to begin with and the writers and director did nothing to enhance it. Man of Steel was decent but this movie was a big step down. You may be tempted to watch it but please resist. Unless you like wasting your time."
" One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
",-0.6249,-0.9584,2017-08-04 00:00:00,1,"I went to the cinema with my family, because I'm not specially fan of this kind of movies, so I can give and objective opinion. If you erase the fighting scenes this become into an horrible heap of clichés and nonsense events who move the poor progression of the plot. The following is spoiler: The end (and the way in which Batman and Superman became friends) it's hilarious with a sentimental varnish of emotion. Come on! Really they stop the death struggle for the name of the mothers??? It's like a guy want to kill me but I suddenly said ""My mother name is Claudia"" and the guy reply ""Really! Mine too!! Let's go for a beer and speak about our mothers! Sorry for try to kill you pal""... Really? I took it like an insult for my smartness."
" Missing something. Music killed it.
",-0.7717,-0.8969,2017-08-04 00:00:00,4,"Good action sequences. Some questions remained unanswered. Superman's music meant to make him look/feel depressed, really killed the movie since that low pitch background music became irritating. Story was okay and though i understand the angles through which the director tried to portray the movie, there was something missing. It felt too chopped up. Affleck look/feels awkward as Batman...and I'm not sure if because he's been around a long time and he has 'baggage'. Hollywood chooses their faces well...he has a Bruce Wayne face, just as Cavill has that Clark Kent face etc....but something was off with him in that bat-suit. Probably, Bale should have reprised the role or probably they should have introduced a fresh character."
" Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Connection. The most under-appreciated film of our generation
",0.0,0.8694,2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"A completely unique take on America's two most famous comic book superheroes. An aggressive and ruthless Batman who is older and jaded. A sensitive and reserved Superman who has to deal with the pressures of being a hero and a villain by the world (as seen in a montage in the film known as the ""Day of the Dead"" scene.) The films major antagonist is Lex Luthor who is also a new, younger, and more psychotic take on the character. Calculated, but keeps up a very charming and humorous appearance. A common complaint in this film is that the plot and characters are ""messy"" and not well characterized. But if you take a deeper look, in a realistic situation, Bruce Wayne would develop major aggression and fear after 20 years of fighting crime (as well as the death of his parents at age 10.) And Clark Kent would logically feel a level of guilt for having caused damage to Metropolis following the fight at the end of Man of Steel, though he had no choice since the fight was to save the world. Collateral damage would be inevitable with two superhuman-like figures (Superman and Zod.)The performances in this film only add to the well written characters. Ben Affleck gives us an enticing interpretation of Batman that is smooth out of the costume and gritty and raw in it. Henry Cavil gives us a nuanced Superman and shows much emotion at times without saying a word, much like Affleck. Jesse Rosenberg gives us a humorous, but mysterious performance with implied past traumas making him the monster he is, also showing so much with facial expressions and not words. A complaint that is also very common for this film is the cinematography and visual effects. The films stylistic choices in this respect are actually quite fitting for the atmosphere of the film. Dark, with a sense of color and stylistic visual effects (since it is a comic book film.) The music in this film is as important as anything else. It truly makes you feel the majestic nature of Superman, the dark nature of Bruce Wayne and Batman, and the conniving nature of Lex Luthor. And the motif that has followed itself into the most recent DC film for Wonder Woman. The films polarizing, but in my mind BRILLIANT director Zack Snyder has sculpted his vision into film. It feels like the film Stanley Kubrick would have made if he loved superheroes. Much that is implied but not directly put into words, which works here because it adds depth and details to be discovered upon in different viewings.All in all, this film when seen with an open mind, is filled with depth and detail on virtually all levels. It is much more than surface level intrigue. I'd go into it more, but I don't want a spoiler filled review. This is my personal favorite comic book film, and cracks my top 20 favorite films. A unique cinematic experience that leaves me completely satisfied after every viewing. One last note. This film may never be recognized for the depth I believe it has, but I hope in time it does, the way many of the films recognized as classics now we're received when they were first released, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, and even Citizen Kane. So go into this film with an open mind and you might find there is more to it than many give it credit for."
" Hollywood Ending
",0.0,-0.9618,2017-07-30 00:00:00,1,"Yesterday, I watched Hollywood Ending, a comedy film by Woody Allen in which he plays a blind film director who makes what may be the world's worst film. Apparently, Batman v. Superman is the film he directed.The single most incredible thing is that the villain has information and resources that could only be possessed by someone else.Hollywood's stupidest fight sequence ever.There are a few talented actors who have nothing to work with and too many talentless people.Cameos by real-life journalism personalities appearing as themselves which only reveals them as personalities rather than journalists.The saddest thing is that I thought I had nothing better to do that watch this. In retrospect, I could have been cutting myself or hitting myself in the head with a hammer. Fortunately, I'm sure the trauma management part of my brain will suppress memory of this."
" choppy and hard to follow
",-0.1027,0.97,2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,This movie is plagued with a confusing plot that is loaded with incomprehensible editing. this movie is a lot of scenes just happening and there isn't any flow to the narrative. Even after viewing the director's cut its still pretty choppy and hard to follow. The ending is also pretty predictable and if you are no stranger to superhero movies you've pretty much seen all this stuff before.The visuals are fantastic in this movie as to be expected from a Zack Snyder film. I've always liked the special effects and action that Snyder brings to the DC adaptations. The beauty and action of this movie isn't enough to put it on as a highly recommended watch though and it's really worth passing over and not wasting 3 hrs of your time.
" A Masterpiece Surrounded By Studio Interference
",0.6249,0.9746,2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice was one of 2016's hugest movies for good and bad reasons. A great Batman movie stuck inside a yawn- fest of a Superman movie. It gave us what we finally wanted for so many years, Batman fighting Superman. However, we wanted a good reason to see them fight as well, and not a prologue to Justice League.This movie has some amazing visuals as well as fight scenes, a plus for the growing DCEU, but it is only the second movie in the franchise and is shoving way too many references or hints to upcoming movies. It's very clear that DC are trying to copy Marvel's Cinematic Universe by trying to shove in as many characters as possible, and this is a bad thing. Sometimes characters are rushed and do not seem fleshed out or very entertaining to watch. Take Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor (Jr?), possibly one of the weirdest interpretations of Lex Luthor you could possibly think of. We all like a bit of change for movies nowadays, especially Superhero movies, however, this change doesn't work. Lex Luthor in this movie is a crazy psychopathic man with Joker-esque vibes, with brief moments of twitchiness and uncomfortable viewing.It's clear that Warner Bros. wanted to make a huge jump forward with this movie to catch up with Marvel, the Justice League were shown in this movie in little unnecessary email attachments. This is bad because it's setting up other movies before getting to the own movies plot. If anything, put them in at a point where it doesn't distract from the overall story.Doomsday. Supposedly a combination of Zod's and Luthor's DNA, it's not shown how this massive creature comes out of nowhere, and not explained. Also, Doomsday looks like a Lord of the Ring's troll ripoff.+ Ben Affleck as Batman. Everyone thought this guy would suck as Batman, but how they were wrong. Epic action scenes, the most comic accurate suit to date, and brutal. This Batman is a war-hardened, old Batman, reminiscent of The Dark Knight Returns Batman. A Batman we've not seen on the big screen, and Affleck handled it perfectly.+ Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred is a gem to watch in this movie (and kind of the comic relief). Irons is himself at his best in this movie. Everything you'd expect from the Alfred character in this movie.+ Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. One of the highest points for this movie. Wonder Woman is one of the best things in this movie. A sort of combination between Batman and Supes, Wonder Woman plays a small role in this movie, showing up here and there and then showing up for the epic climax.+- The Ultimate Edition is the perfect way to watch this movie. The extra 30 minutes explains and cleans up a lot of what the original theatrical cut had lacking off. However, WB should have let this cut be the theatrical cut. Because of the interference we are stuck with the two cuts today, and has effected the ratings a lot."
" Watch Extended cut, not theatrical
",-0.2732,0.9988,2017-07-14 00:00:00,10,"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

" I don't understand the hate (Ultimate Edition)
",0.4585,0.9986,2017-07-11 00:00:00,10,"I realize that this is a very unpopular opinion, but this is probably one of my favorite superhero movies to date. I even like it better than Wonder Woman (I only mention this because it's a DC movie that got reviewed higher). It is such a unique movie. It has so many memorable quotes. The action is so epic and perfect. The music is beautiful and epic. The shots are epic. Batman is pure gold in this. Wonder Woman is introduced and steals the show. Superman is epic. The story line could be better, but I love what they decided to do. I don't think there's anything wrong with the story. It's just different.Yes, Superman is very conflicted in this movie, but I love that it takes the approach of ""the real world with real consequences"". It's such a deep movie. He will be back with a smile on his face in Justice League. I love the old Superman movies where he's a perfect boy scout because it fit with the times, but now this version is so much better. Now onto the negatives. The only thing I understand what gets hated on is Lex Luthor. In a way he is the same, but his persona is so much more different. Jesse does a great job at acting, but it threw me off guard when I first saw it. He is very quirky, but it works. He is smart and menacing. He is honestly a better villain than most. People just didn't like him because he's so different. I believe I'm the only one who LOVED what they did with Doomsday. I love that he was created rather than just crash landing on Earth or something. It made so much more sense. He looked different as well, but he didn't stray to far from the original look. He had spikes towards the end. Hopefully he will come back. All in all, I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I still love the movie. It's so deep. I love the rest of DC's movies and Marvel's movies, and I'm excited for what both are going to come up with next!"
" If You're Going to Watch It, Go with the Ultimate Edition. It's Slightly Better.
",0.3832,-0.9902,2017-07-04 00:00:00,6,"There is enough discussion to be had about BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE that it can't possibly be donewelljustice in the limited space here. I was eager to discuss this slow-motion train wreck after leaving the theater in the spring of '16 but my friends were less interested in blowing their cash on a movie that garnered a discouraging 27% on Rotten Tomatoes than I was. After Marvel Studios built a multi-billion enterprise with their comic properties, DC finally realized they were falling behind and there was a load of money yet to be made with their immense stable of characters. Until this point, the only DC characters to be gifted with decent blockbuster films had been Batman and Superman. I mean, this one is still basically just Batman and Superman, but this one is Batman and Superman on screen *at the same time*! It also serves as the jumping off point for DC's dive into their full-blown JUSTICE LEAGUE. Unfortunately, whereas Marvel had the sense to ease each of their less mainstream characters into the public consciousness with individual films for Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, etc. so people less familiar would have some footing before we were given THE AVENGERS, DC decided to catch up on lost time by jumping in head first with this confusing mess of a film where director Zack Snyder and writers Chris Terrio & David Goyer had to accomplish a *lot* in a limited time.DAWN OF JUSTICE had the complex mission of: (1) introducing a new Batman to audiences (Ben Affleck), (2) introducing a new Lex Luthor to audiences (Jesse Eisenberg), (3) establishing a reason general audiences would accept for Batman to even fight Superman, (4) shoehorning an introduction to Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) into the film, and (5) setting up the creation of the Justice League This would be a lot for any filmmaker to tackle and, in this case, that director is Zack Snyder. He's a man known for his prioritizing of style over substance and, while I've enjoyed his other movies, I couldn't help but feel he was in a little over his head. There was so much jammed into this movie that, when it was cut down to a bloated 150 minutes for the theatrical release, it made almost no sense. Since then I've only ever watched the three hour extended director's cut and I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the movie and might be curious do the same. It's still bloated and there's still pacing issues and there are still some character decisions that don't make the best of sense but at least the plot is all there and you aren't left with a dozen questions. The much-maligned plot device revolving around our heroes' mothers is still there and still lamethere's not avoiding thatbut the rest of it works a little better. And because the extended edition is R-rated, you can watch Batman murder in even more brutal fashion.Yeah, Batman murders a lot in this movie. That's just where we're at now. The Batman of DAWN OF JUSTICE is an old, grizzled, cynical Batman who seems tired of fighting crime and watching it have little to no effect, so now he's strapped an enormous machine gun to the front of the Batmobile and he has no qualms with snapping necks or sending criminals to prison with a Bat- branding that guarantees they'll be murdered inside. For that matter, why are so many other criminals in prison so eager to do Batman's dirty work? Aren't they operating on opposite teams? Anyway, Batman's a killer but the good news is Ben Affleck actually makes for a pretty cool Batman. All those years Kevin Smith said his buddy Affleck should be Batman, and he was right. I dig it and I really hope we get a solo Batman movie with Affleck sooner rather than later. Other new additions Eisenberg and Gadot don't fare as well. I love Jesse Eisenberg but I still have a hard time accepting his new eccentric, high- energy spastic Lex Luthor. He enters this movie with a pre-loaded hatred for Superman as if we're just supposed to understand he hates Superman because we, the audience, understand that these characters are enemies because that's what they've always been. How about a little background to explain Luthor's burning hatred for Superman? DAWN OF JUSTICE gives us some half-baked excuse of Luthor hating Superman's god-like status, but why wouldn't he have tried reaching out to Superman first to manipulate him into benefiting his own enterprises? Then maybe Superman turns him down and tells him his practices are less than virtuous and warn him to watch himself before he has to step in, and *then* Luthor feels the need to get him out of the way. Or something. I don't know. I wasn't paid millions of dollars to write this thing but I bet I couldn't done better than ""Grrr, he's like a god and I hate that and I'm willing to destroy anyone and everyone to make him gone.""A quick note about Gal Gadot, our new Wonder Woman, before I run out of space (I could go one so much longer with this movie. I wasn't kidding). I was not a fan of Gadot's Wonder Woman in this movie. I had a hard time at first getting through her accent and her line delivery wasn't the strongest. But I've since seen the 2017 solo WONDER WOMAN movie and I couldn't imagine a better choice. When she has more than five lines of dialogue, it's much easier to acclimate to her accent and she can, in fact, act. So Wonder Woman's weak entry into the DC cinematic universe is probably another fault of Snyder, Terrio, and Goyer. She's good and, for the record, WONDER WOMAN is so much stronger than this movie. Running out of spaceuhJimmy Olsen's meaningless existenceuhnonsensical, overly complex conspiracy plot umgeez three hours, really?! Hmmthat final battle anduhuhm Martha!"
" Ben Affleck, you tried to save this movie
",0.4939,-0.8719,2017-07-02 00:00:00,6,"First of all I would like to praise Ben Affleck for his portrayal as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. He created a brutal Batman that made me as an audience member truly feel that it was a character to fear. The only complaint I have of his portrayal is the character's willingness, as this goes against the source material, however it is in-keeping with the tone of the film However, Ben Affleck's performance was one of the few highlights of this flop of a film. This was a film that fans had been anticipating ever since the announcement, the Bat vs Superman.However the main problem with this film is content. The film had so many sub plots that it was hard to keep track of character's motivations and goals. The first 20 minutes of the film is poorly edited and the action jumps all over the place, disorienting the audience. Henry Cavil gave a standard performance as the man of steal, however i believe the actor was not given a chance to show off his acting skills, as he spent the majority of the film showing the emotion of pain Gal Gadot gave a good performance for the time she had on screen,she left me wanting more and created a sense of mystery about the character. Her introduction in the costume however is a highlight of the film Jesse Heisenberg, in my opinion, was the worst casting choice in the film. He played himself, with his immature line delivery and melodramatic take on a character who should be a genius, however it came across as a attention seeking child The fight that the film is centered around, like this film, was anticlimactic. the fight lasted less than 10 minutes and I was left unsatisfied with the reason for the conflict.Zach Synider is a visionary director, and he clearly showed this in the film. i believe he is not the one to blame for the films failure, that lies with the rest of the writers, who tried to please fans but left them with a bitter taste in the mouth."

One yearns for the beauty of the Burton Batman movies. Zero suspense, the formula has been done to death. Whose stupid idea was it to have Wonder Woman come to the rescue the boys? I thought I mind find something fun in this movie, but nothing was fun, everything about it makes me loathe it."
" A very deep, emotional, and at times complex film
",0.2212,0.9283,2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers.

" This will be remembered for Wonder Woman's debut
",0.0,0.9486,2017-06-24 00:00:00,7,"As I write this, the new solo Wonder Woman movie is playing to rave reviews and bringing in trainloads of box office dollars. The lesson? For me, it says that (a) people actually still like to get a positive upbeat feeling in this type of film, (b) they respond to something genuinely new (a female superhero! and totally carrying the movie!), and (c) you need to match the right director to the right material. At the theater where I saw BvS (as was the case everywhere), the audience spontaneously cheered when Wonder Woman made her dramatic fighting entrance in the middle of the battle against the Doomsday creature. Everyone had been waiting for her! Yes, BvS is constantly entertaining and slickly produced with good actors. And the opening scene -- a flashback to the destruction of Metropolis during Man of Steel, now as seen from ground level -- is terrific. A vast battle between cosmic forces is happening above the city as the people below (including Bruce Wayne) watch helplessly. But did we have to go on from there to the end of the film when now Gotham City is a smoking ruin too? The journey in between has enough material for two movies, leaving you wishing for a clearer, cleaner line without quite so many side trails.Which brings us to the director. Zack Snyder has a very uneven relationship with this material. I admit Snyder's preference for dark, gritty, tortured personalities and loads of bludgeoning action fits Batman pretty darn well (and Watchmen, his earlier effort). After all, Batman sort of represents the zeitgeist of our age. But Superman? Wonder Woman? That's where the real mismatch comes in. Superman needs to be sunny Kansas wheatfields and titanic deeds in the name of all that is pure, simple, and good in humanity. And stylistically that just isn't Zack Snyder, try as he might. The whole premise of the plot -- that somehow Batman and the American Congress would actually be suspicious enough to destroy someone who saved the planet from an alien invasion -- just rings false. I found it hard to buy into. And of course the head-to-head battle is a bit of a cheat. If Superman has his normal powers, it's no contest, but if Batman uses kryptonite, it's also no contest. A ""fair fight"" between them is impossible. Superman vs. Wonder Woman, which has happened in the comics, would be more interesting.Give credit to all the main actors though for wading through this material. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are fine, and Gal Gadot shows us a glimpse of what would emerge next year in a great Wonder Woman. Good work as well from Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Holly Hunter, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, and Laurence Fishburne. Without them it would be much less interesting."
" Extended Version Shuts Haters Up
",-0.4939,-0.64,2017-06-21 00:00:00,9,"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: ""Pick up a comic book!"" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

It was fairly slow in the beginning which probably knocks it down a star or 2 but Jesse Eisenburg as Lex Luthor is just God awful. His appearances on screen are like finger nails on the chalk board, and there is no doubt in my mind that this would be up around 7.9 or 8 stars if they had just done a better job of casting this part. And now I see they are putting this guy in the Justice League movie? Noooooo I may not go to see it at all now hearing this, unless his part is like a one scener, then I will bare with it. What the heck were they thinking casting this guy? I would also guess that the domestic box office would have been a good 30-50 million dollars higher (at the very least) with a better actor. I know I would have seen it again, and I have no interest in ever watching it again thanks to his presence in it, though I will surely watch the Wonder Woman scenes again because she is awesome!"
" BVS is Amazing.
",0.5859,0.936,2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,'Contains Spoilers' Ben Affleck was amazing as Batman he puts the Dark in Dark Knight.I love the bit when you see The Flash after the Nightmare scene with the Parademons.Wonder Woman and Superman were so bad ass they make Nick Fury from Marvel look weak.Zack Synder is a legend and should praised not Slated.
" A once in a lifetime movie (BVS ultimate edition)
",0.0,0.9921,2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of ""extra"" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the ""Martha"" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."
" Not THAT bad.
",0.431,0.9711,2017-06-15 00:00:00,6,"My rating: 6,5To review this movie as best as i can i'll have to divide it in three parts: the start, the middle and the ending. The start was like watching two different movies, it constantly jumped from batman's story to superman's and it was all really slow. In the middle, the movie became mildly entertaining as the story was progressing but still, it wasn't that great. The ending on the other hand was what made me rate this with a vote higher than a 5; The adrenaline of the fighting scenes, the surprisingly amazing acting of Jesse Eisenberg, the awesome cameo of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, that really well done animation and the ending(that didn't fail to give me chills)...all of this made up for a movie that wasn't that great but, in the end, wasn't even THAT bad."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.9041,2017-06-15 00:00:00,10,"When I saw this movie I wasn't over-excited for a few reasons, for example I was huge fan of the previous actors. But the second time I watched the movie I was a bit more open minded and I understood that the movie's case was actually really smart and I loved Jesse Eisenberg and there were allot of things that make this movie a great one. So it makes me sad that it has such rating. I read why people didn't like this movie and one reason is that it was too long. COME ON!!! All the good movies are long like ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" are much longer movies. I also read allot of stuff about the trailer. People stop watching trailers before watching a movie it can ruin the whole movie for you because of a spoil in it or because you will excpect allot from the movie because you watched a really good trailer or something like that, i never watch trailers. So that is why I will support this great movie by putting 10, cause it really is underrated. Stop reading if you haven't watched the movie(spoiler alert). The last complain I read is that Doomsday had bad CGI but he he just was really ugly and that's really logical. But that is a complain that probably is true but isn't worth mentioning cause it doesn't really matter. The movie's story was really good, the actors were also great and overall it was a great movie.-"
" Boring, pretentious garbage
",-0.3182,-0.9818,2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,"...Where do I even begin. Absolutely nothing about this movie works. I somehow ended up watching the three hour long version, but decided to only subject myself to the torture of the 2.5 hours viewed by cinema-goers, and I tried desperately to keep my eyes pried open during that time frame. Despite sounding uncultured, this film's major flaw is that it's so...boring. If your movie is going to have the gall to be three hours long, you best believe that you have some intriguing characters, plot, and action to make me hold my pee in the theatre that long. The first sign we're going to be in for a long ride--we get a recreation of a scene that is literally the ONE THING everyone knows about Batman already. We get it, his modus operandi is avenging his parent's death! But then, the audience is expected to know everything about Batman, Alfred, and the Batcave; while ALSO having been expected to have seen Man of Steel. Funny, considering this movie's title isn't, in fact, ""Man of Steel 2"". So after some more of Snyder's snooze- worthy slo-mo shtick, we're thrust into the middle of a plot so incoherent that I'm still not entirely sure what exactly occurred. This 'film' feels more like a string of tangentially related clips than an actual movie. Trying to keep up with the logic of it is exhausting. Speaking of exhausting, the cinematography is so dull and dreary that it makes Watchmen look like Carebears in comparison. It's a perfect suit for the thudding, pretentious, grim script though. I don't think a single affable thing is uttered in the whole movie. I believe it exacerbated my clinical depression.But moving on to the ostensibly fun part--the characters! Our attention is already taken because we know them; Batman, Superman, Lois Lane, even Wonder Woman shows up for a bit. These characters are iconic and we expect certain things from them. But the issue here is--who exactly are we rooting for again? Do we want Batman to kill Superman, or vice versa? This lack of a clear protagonist is a glaring error, because we have no stake in the action. Most DC fans aren't going to desire the death of one of their beloved superheroes, so...what's the point? Batman's quip that if we have a 1% suspicion of Superman being a threat, then we should annihilate him is painfully dumb. If I have a 1% chance of getting cancer, should I go ahead and begin chemo? So to further our lack of investment in the conflict, we have some woeful acting to accompany it. Henry Cavill's only asset is his sculpted body, Ben Affleck does yet another brooding Batman, and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is an impotent, sniveling recreation of Heath Ledger's Joker. It would be amusing, if literally anything at all in this movie was amusing.By the infamous ""Martha"" point (and oh dear god is the logic employed there mind-numbingly baseless), I couldn't even maintain a semblance of interest in what was going on. If anyone who enjoyed this film could actually decipher the plot and wasn't just watching to see two beefcakes beat each other up, please let me know the ways of your immaculate intelligence. For this film fails to either entertain, or enlighten (its not-so-subtle motif of godliness is eye-rollingly tired and shallow)--so therefore, what's the point?"
" worst comic ever
",-0.6249,0.7444,2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,"this was the worst comic i ever seen, despite of how weak characters are, it totally ruined the BATMAN, weak acting, weak story and it made me hate them. Batman was my hero from the beginning. i miss Christopher Nolan's BATMAN. it is very important when they make movies working with loved heroes as batman, superman, wolverine or else."
" Good movie: worst ending: too much power
",-0.296,0.9587,2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,I would have given 7 but after seeing the rating of others I think that its not fair.Its a wonderful film with a bad ending.Things i hated in this movie areBatman dreamsSuperman love of Lois lane - who wants that? we wanna see batman and superman fight.Final Doomsday.I think DC is creating characters that have too much strength. I like batman films better because he is super hero with no power so we know his limits and its thrilling
" Son of Krypton vs. Bat of Gotham!
",0.0,0.7959,2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,The biggest Gladiator fight comes to life! To understand the storyline in this movie you would have to watch Man of Steel. Overall I loved this movie from beginning to end. I actually found it hard to believe that many were disappointed. Ben Affleck was a better choice for Batman than what I actually thought. Also this movie paved a path for Wonder Woman and the Justice League. Once you understand the story you would appreciate this movie.
" It took a while ....
",0.0,0.9455,2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"It took a while for this movie to get going. It meandered around like a lost puppy, trying to find the direction it wanted to go. Finally, at about the midpoint of the movie, it got focused, and from there on out, it kicked some major ass. Forget the windbag reviews about how terrible this movie is. Sure, the first hour is a bit convoluted, but it all comes together magnificently. The last half of this movie is what action movies are all about. Then there are the reviews going on about how wonderful Wonder Woman was. She was a bit part, and was simply there to lead up to Batman introducing the idea, near the end of the movie, that ""all those like them"" need to band together. Obviously, we have some sequels on the way. Yet Wonder Woman was simply an additional character to the movie, somewhat removed from the main conflict. So take all the hater reviews with a grain of salt. Accept the fact that this movie starts slowly, and then just sit back and enjoy the ride when it all comes together."
" Most Literarily Competent Superhero Movie EVER
",0.3774,0.6331,2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"As a lover of literature and film, I have found Hollywood lacking in its treatment of the Superhero genre. I am fresh from a night out at a 3D showing of Wonder Woman, and it is another example of the poor writing in this genre. Frankly, BvS is the only film in this genre with literary elements of irony: morally flawed and conflicted heroes. We also are swept away to a universe in which we witness, from the first person perspective of Superman, discrimination against a so- called alien, Superman himself, the result of which is a degree of confusion. After all, this alien looks just like us. Adding to the film's moral complexity, in the midst of their antipathy, Batman manages sensitivity for Superman's mother, having lost his own (as comic book readers would know from external sources). Overall, this is a film rich in its presentation of these characters as complex, vulnerable beings. The critics be damned!! See this, if you already have not!!"
" Boring and all over the place
",-0.3182,-0.5698,2017-06-01 00:00:00,1,"Not much more to say than this. Also I don't know what's people's problem with Affleck playing Batman, it's not like the guy who played Batman in the Nolan movies set the bar high.I don't usually watch Batman movies without a Joker but this was recommended by a friend and was truly disappointing so I couldn't even watch all of it really. Annoying generic self-entitled female characters, bland, predictable male characters, mediocre acting, story all over the place making no sense, and worst of all - boring and non-engaging...Aside from Batman (somewhat) and Lex Luthor, all of the main characters were bland and forgettable. Stick to the Nolan movies, at least they had good characters.Jesse Eisenberg did a great job and I'm actually looking into other movies with him, he seems like a good, memorable actor who almost managed to make this utterly boring movie fresh for a few seconds with his presence.Overall, what a terrible last few years for DC, they really couldn't sink any lower, could they? Oh wait, of course, an obligatory Wondar Woman movie is coming out. And how could we forget the ""oh so amazing"" Suicide Squat train wreck, which was also pandering by making Harley Quinn the main character... Pandering sure goes a long way. To the bottom."
" Keeping hopes low, saved my day.
",0.5423,-0.9435,2017-06-01 00:00:00,6,"Went to see the movie with my expectations, keeping low, so I would say I was not highly disappointed. Without getting much into detail I would enlist pros and cons.Cons: Dialogs appeared incomplete or meaningless in few parts of movie maybe because I watched in Hindi. Story quality is below average, villain building up rivalry between two superheroes is weak. Idea to bring monster in existence, with somebody's blood & a dead body of an alien, seems illogical. Low standard of superheroes with super-high standard of destruction caused.Pros: I liked Ben Affleck as batman and other characters in general."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9711,2017-05-27 00:00:00,10,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Boy oh Boy....this was a great experience....I have to say after Man of Steel (which was okay but by no means great), I didn't have much expectations from this, and to top it off the castings for this film had set the comic book fans on fire. But tell you what, this is epic. Some people are even calling it better than the Dark Knight, while I wouldn't go that far, I would still call this a complete package. Affleck's Batman is AMAZING. His Bruce Wayne is not as cool and casual as Christian Bale's but he doesn't need to considering this is a relatively old Batman who has seen some very dark times. His partnership with Jeremy Irons adds some much needed lightness to the movie. Cavill delivered the dialogues during the fight scene with Batman in a near perfect way. Gal Gadot had a much bigger role to play than seen in the trailers. And Jesse was good in a complex way. Fans have to understand that his Luthor is not muscular as compared to what we have seen in previous Superman movies His Luthor is an evil genius who does a great job of pitting the two giants against each other. Jesse played the role to his strengths as he should have. Contrary to the popular perception(especially after the third trailer) that the whole movie was spoil-ed, the plot was way more deeper than we imagined. The only issues were a fight scene where CGI looked dull and maybe, just maybe a bit over stuffing. But overall, this is EPIC."

" A greatly compelling movie.
",0.2944,0.9393,2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie was one of the most controversial movies released in 2016, and although it wasn't perfect, I find this movie truly excellent. Theatrical release- There are some problems, such as the plot holes that were found throughout the film. Because the movie run time had to be cut down from 3 hours to 2.5 hours lots of important information was lost. Many aspects of Lex Luthor's plan didn't make sense because of this, as well as the whole desert scene and the scenes with superman investigating Batman (which is in the ultimate edition.) Overall, the theatrical release was good but wasn't as good as it could have been. 6.5/10Ultimate Edition- Though some may feel as though sitting through three hours of a superhero action blockbuster is a waste of their time, they will be proved wrong with this one. BVSUE is a great movie. As stated previously, the plot holes that made the theatrical cut hard to understand were completely filled in this movie. The desert scene at the beginning of the film actually serves a purpose instead of just being some sort of gun fight with Superman saving Lois. The plot makes sense and Lex Luthor's ingenious plan to kill/ stop Superman is absolutely incredible. Kudos to Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio for that one. 9/10SPOILER- In defense of the Martha scene, many complained that Batman only ceased to kill Superman because that when Superman said Martha, he realized that their mothers had the same name. This, however, is not the case. The reason Batman didn't kill superman when he had the chance was that he realized that if he killed the man of steel, he would be taking a child away from his mother just as his parents were taken from him. Just putting that out there. ---This movie, with a compelling story line and smart plot on top of 3 great action sequences makes it a wonderful action movie. This movie really captures the essence of a good comic book movie and compiles some great action scenes. My only complaints are what I said about the Theatrical Version, and also that this is a movie that needs to be understood, and may have to be watched more than once to get ones head around it.My age classification for this movie would be 11+. Do not expect to sit down and watch the Avengers with this movie. Although it has amazing action and fights, it is also a dark drama and almost crime movie. Younger children may also enjoy, but it is really idea for those 11 and older. Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice is one of those movies that people may not like at first, but will become greatly appreciated over time."
" Dull, overstuffed and contrived.
",-0.4019,0.6231,2017-05-24 00:00:00,4,"With the MCU currently making millions at the box office, it was inevitable that DC would eventually get in on the trend. The trouble with ""Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" is that it tries to cram too much set-up into one film, and the result is a jumbled mess that that feels like multiple movies crammed together. I'll start with some positives. Ben Affleck is surprisingly good as Batman. His portrayal of the character is by far the best thing about the film, delivering a surprisingly intimidating and engaging performance that almost makes you forget how angry everyone was when he was cast. I also don't think Jesse Eisenberg was as bad as he was made out to be. Sadly, Superman fares less well. Once again, Zack Snyder has mistaken ""stiff and boring"" for ""gritty and conflicted"", resulting in a Superman that we're never given a reason to care about. And the actual ""fight?"" It lasts about eight minutes and ends because their Moms have the same name. No, I'm not making this up. Even Wonder-Woman, one of the few highlights of the film, feels shoehorned into the plot for no good reason. She certainly shows promise as a character, but Gal Gadot is let down by a poor script that doesn't give her much to work with. Overall, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" has its moments, but it's a bumpy start to the DCEU, and fails to deliver the epic fight we were promised in the title. Perhaps if it had been all about Batman, it could have been better."
" A darn near perfect comic book movie
",0.5719,0.9655,2017-05-19 00:00:00,10,"After watching Batman V Superman I have to say, I had a lot of opinions about it. although it had many flaws, to many stories put into one, the questionable resolution of the batman and superman fight (which I actually liked) it had much more positives. The fight scenes are beautiful, especially the warehouse scene, each of the shots are like an artwork, crafted by the artist Zack Snyder. I loved how they did Superman's death, it was emotional and really well done. in all, the movie had much more positives than negatives. Don't let critics or others create your opinion on this movie. if you enjoy action, explosions, and just amazing scenes, this is a movie for you so go and watch it and make your own opinion"
" Cinematography really good
",0.4927,-0.698,2017-05-17 00:00:00,6,"Well, it's enjoyable, but the story has so many problems. No real build up with suspense. There's nothing new here. I have to say the cinematography is very good and above a lot of other movies. For a very expensive film, you'd think they'd fix scenes with clear acting problems! This is a big budget film where a lot of people were just lazy!"
" It's bad but good
",0.3818,0.8008,2017-05-16 00:00:00,5,"Batman v Superman was not good at all. The only good part was the fight scenes, and even then they weren't that great, but that doesn't make it one of the worst movies of it's generation. I believe that while Batman v Superman was bad, it wasn't meant to be a huge success, rather it was to set up for it's sequels such as Justice League and Suicide Squad, and while Suicide Squad wasn't that good either I still liked it, and what we've seen from Justice League, I think DC just might make a come back. Even after all that people still think that you shouldn't watch Batman v Superman, when rather the opposite is the case. I feel you should watch it if you truly care about DC and such. Sure it wasn't as good as Civil War and basically every other hero vs hero movie ever made, but it's still worth a watch. Still at least it's better than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies."
" Batman AND Superman Vs. plot and storytelling...

If you watch it after reading this, then you deserve everything you get anyway!The movie was horrible. Do not believe the 6+ rating. The 5 star and above reviews are from children and fan boys who refuse to admit to themselves that this was utter garbage, just because they love the characters!I NEVER fall asleep during a movie. I even managed to stay awake through the art-house cr*p-fest, Solaris, which is an almost impossible feat, that I feel should come with some type of reward, or medal. I managed to drift off in BvS just after the bizarre dream sequence. I'm so glad I waited for this movie on Sky!It jumps all over the place. The plot is incoherent and full of holes. The acting is acceptable, but dull. Characters that famously behave one way, behave totally differently, just to allow lazy writing and set up stupid action scenes. Essentially what this movie is saying, is that Bruce Wayne is smart enough to conceal his identity, build crazy gadgets and even fight the man of steel one on one..... but is too dumb to talk things out with superman. Yet just sharing a mothers name with your enemy, suddenly makes them your buddy. I'll be sure to try and guess my opponent's mothers name in my next bar brawl, and wrap things up quickly!The sudden and pointless inclusion of a super enemy at the end, just to allow for the protagonists to join forces and fight lot's of visual effects for 20 mins, was just lazy nonsense.I could list plot inconsistencies all day long, but I already wasted enough time on this movie, but I will say this in regards to the ending in particular. The Kryptonians banned the super monster because it was just TOOOOOO dangerous, yet it can be taken out by one Kryptonian, an amazon and....er.. a fella in a rubber suit! Yet a WHOLE planet of Kryptonians were scared of it!?! Really?If you enjoy flashing lights and punch sounds for 2 hours, or you love being angry, or you have recently sustained a catastrophic head injury resulting in a drastic loss of intelligence, then this movie is for you!"
" Criminal V Terrorist: Dawn of Toilets an insult to Batman and Superman superheroes
",-0.9081,-0.9998,2017-05-09 00:00:00,1,"*A HUGE MAJOR SPOILERS* Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the worst I mean the bottom of the worst peace of sh** garbage, toilets stinker asshole awful horrible criminally superhero movie I ever saw in my life. I can not describe the words how much I hate Zack Snyder his Man of Steel and this movie which in my honest opinion an insult to DC Superman and Batman superheroes the two characters. I grew up watching Superman (Christopher Reeve) and Tim Burton's Batman (Michael Keaton) they were my favorite superheroes as child growing up. Smallville become my favorite TV show of all time as teen I constantly watched that show.This movie is so offensive that my eyes hurt. The worst superman and batman movie I ever saw! F*** Zack Snyder and his movies and his upcoming movies.I was the only schmuck, the only asshole who went watching Ultimate Edition that it is over three hours long. 3 hrs and 2.mins was so over long, over boring that I could not finish the movie. I had to quit after 1 hr of watching and go to sleep and watch the rest of the movie 2 hrs. the next day. Why I hate this movie to death: First over 1000000 people dies in this movie. I thought I watched terror attack on innocent people in this movie! Superman is a terrorist I don't care if theatrical cut is rated PG-13 I don't care. Superman kill's people with his little eyes he let's people die, he doesn't save anyone. He is selfish and all he cares is his stupid girlfriend. Superman must I mean must kill people why? really why. He kills doomsday he has to kill something so that he is Superman really? You know what we have DC terrorist as a superhero now. Henry Cavill is not Superman, he can not be Superman he can not act, he can't be Clark Kent he is a terrorist. Lex Luthor kills people and superman doesn't stop him and he dies on the end! Superman will and will always be Christopher Reeve and no one else. He can not be replaced. I love Superman I, II (Richard Lester version not Donner Cut) and III.Superman in this movie dies why does Superman has to die?, I did not want to see Superman dying and dead on the end of this movie!!! Superman has no remorse for the destruction he caused in the first movie. In the big fight he smashes Batman through a building causing the building to collapse. Ditto for Doomsday, smashes him in to a power plant of some sort. He is not even thinking about anyone's safety.Why is Doomsday angry with Superman? Since he is made from Zod & Luthor's genes, does anger/hatred towards someone pass through genes? There is again an apocalypse level destruction. Superman himself contributes to some of it. Thousands people are killed, but superman only saves Lois Lane like I was saying before he saves only his hooker bitch that's how I am going to call her. Superman is a pimp and Lois Lane is his hooker ha ha Superman threatens Batman that he can easily kill Batman, twice. Sounds a serial killer to me.- - - - - - - - Batman is a nasty criminal, Jezus Ben Affleck is awful as Batman he want's to kill Superman crazy. This is crazy I love Ben Affleck but I hate his character I don't think he did a solid job I think he was awful and he sucked ass! Batman steals, he steals and he kills people he uses guns, why does Batman uses guns? Why must Batman kill Superman? He kills people his suit is horrible this is not Batman I know and I grew up with it.Batman wants to KILL Superman just why? Because he was a menace and a terrorist to him we come to this far really? When the moment arrives, Batman stops him self, because his mother's first name is the same as Superman's mother's. And so they become the best of friends. Just like that.He dreams of gun battles in which he kills Superman's soldiers and when superman kills his army Batman screams!!! Why should I care about this movie when Zack Snyder has no appreciate to Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner's movie?! He thinks his Superman is the best, his superman is the king of comic books while Christopher Reeve is impostor and he thinks Superman killing people with his laser eyes is cool. Superman must kill people, he must let people die! This superman in here is a terrorist and batman is a criminal! Ben Affleck you suck as a Batman! I will rather watch Daredevil (2003) than this movie! This is the bottom of the worst movies. They can't make a good superman movies anymore! Zack Snyder Sucks!!!!!! DC you suck! This movie is the biggest pile of s***.This is a real disappointment the story is poor, it has no heart, no soul, adrenaline I can't root for those two, I can't mourn these two have no brains they are DUMB! The CGI are horrible the fight between those two is fake, oh and Wonder Woman sucks a dick, through inter movie I did not see her doing anything.Jesse Eisenberg was horrendous.For Superman I will watch: Superman I, II - (Richard Lester theatrical version), III and Smallvile TV show. For Batman I will watch: The Dark Knight, Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Forever.Captain America: Civil War was Billion way better and decent with heart and soul, than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice that movie was great and a real superhero movie.The rating 0 out of 10 I hate this movie it is brutal violent not decent offensive film DC sucks these days."

People are giving this movie hate because they simply do not understand it. They wan't goofy and silliness action and that is what Marvel gives them. I really love the serious tone this movie delivered. They're not trying to be like Marvel, DC is trying to be different, and that's what I like. A couple of years back they were holding auditions for BVS in Michigan, I went to the audition and landed 2 roles to be an extra for the film. So not only was this an awesome movie, but I got a chance to work with actors and be on set with stars, this was the best experience I've ever had. Batman V. Superman gets a 9/10 in my book."

" One of the greatest Superhero movies ever made. The Ultimate Edition is the better version.
",0.7964,0.9932,2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"You better believe it. Don't know what these critics are smoking. This is a priceless gem right here. If you're expecting a lighthearted movie with jokes every 5 min, go see another film. This is a dark/serious/thriller masterpiece. Zak Snyder has created something that will go down in history as one of the greatest stories ever told about The Man Of Steel and Dark Knight. Ben Affleck's Batman is the best i have seen so far. He does a great and convincing job on why he wants Superman dead. Definitely a more darker f**ked up Bruce Wayne. A more believable approach to the character, who is a lot older than we have ever seen on the silver screen, and one who has seen many dark times to believe no good can ever last forever.I feel as if people cannot come to terms of seeing these characters as very real psychological individuals. A man wishing he could always save his parents from death and finally getting the chance to save a 'Martha' was his sanity being restored, hence why he couldn't kill Superman. A very touching and gripping scene that's understandable on so many levels. It's about a man falling so deep into his rage to the point where it makes him cruel. And he finds his strength and love restored when Superman makes the ultimate sacrifice in the end.I think fans and general audience believe that after 70 years, these famous characters must stay the same way they did back when they first came out. Which is quite stupid to think of really. These characters must evolve. They must be represented in a more human manner. Clark Kent cannot be goody-goody-tissues all the time. He needs issues, he needs to make mistakes, just like a normal human being does. Their portrayal's in this movie are a lot more believable. The cinematography in this film is beyond amazing. Every shot is like something out of a geek- fans dream. Cheers to Gal Gadot as well, she did a great job as Wonder Woman, and cannot wait to watch her solo movie!The Ultimate Edition is by far the better version, as it's editing is far superior than it's Theatrical Release (Not that i had any issues with that release either). But it does flesh out the plot better. The score in the movie is very emotional at times, and unlike any other score I've ever heard in a while (not since Titanic). Massive props to Han Zimmer for capturing epicness, but also a tear out of me, to the point i had to go and buy the soundtrack on itunes.I'm not a fan of movies that rely heavily on lighthearted humour, and this is most definitely not that type of movie. This is the movie i always wanted to see come alive. It was dark, it was gritty, and at times quite scary to look at.The action scenes are of course amazing as always (when you watch a Zak Snyder film). My favourite scene would have to be the finale where we get to see The Trinity fight in all their glory.As of now, i cannot wait for the 'Justice League' movie to be released!GO ZAK! Please don't let the critics bring you down coz you're on FIRE!!!"
" Not a bad movie at all (haters gonna hate)
",0.431,0.3826,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"This is my first review and i made an account just to tell you that this isn't a bad movie.i understand that people have various reasons to hate.some reasons are legit others are just haters.many people complain they expected something totally out of the box and they were disappointed.so movie turned out to be different for them.Does this justify the reason for 1 star ? Seriously. I am not a great fan of superhero movies.in my opinion they are just money bragging, light films with same formula(Marvel).when i first saw the dark knight trilogy , i was completely blown away.it was a great movie.why ? Because it wasn't just another comic book adaptation. It had everything required for movie. Then there are marvel movies.most of them are good for what they are made for.just entertainment.but that doesn't make them great movies.but still everybody love them. On the other hand dc tries to implement dark themes.half the people don't like dc movies for this reason.the other half want perfection.BvS isn't a perfect movie.there are a lot of flaws.the first hour is boring,no doubt.though it was important for character development.the first hour of the movie could have been made a lot better.as soon as you enter the second hour,i don't see the reason for any dislike.the action scenes aren't lame.they are interesting.the music accompanying the action is quite good too.i was bored in the first hour , but after that the movie held me back at my seat.the script is poor at a lot of places.confrontation of batman and superman , the ending of their fight scene.and at a lot of other places the script was poorly written.the same with other average superhero movies, but people somehow want to like them ,no matter how lame the script is.BvS make up for all those poorly scripted scenes through the action,direction ,cinematography .the story isn't that bad either , acting is good(overacted at a lot of places, but maybe that's just the characters).but i definitely don't understand how is this a poor boring Sleep medicine.its better than half the marvel movies. People go crazy for mediocre, poorly scripted marvel movies(good movies aside).all of the marvel movies have good ratings,i don't know why.people will find every reason to like marvel and every reason to tear apart BvS. Conclusion:- haters gonna hate.its a good but not great,movie"
" cinematic disaster
",-0.6249,-0.9614,2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"a horrible movie contains too many explosions, poor plots and no story telling at all. All actions scenes are somewhat well-made but the lack of understanding it makes them boring, I wanted to get out of the theater right in the middle of this movie. Cringe acting, way too ""dark"" (literally dark) too see, sometimes i don't even know what i'm looking at because 90% of screen is black.This film with the terrible plots, dialogues completely ruined the character Batman, it destroyed what Christopher Nolan built in years for just an hour. I came with excitement, but I wanted my ticket back right after I walked out of the cinema."
" The (K)Night is Darkest just before the Dawn
",-0.4939,0.9976,2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"It is said that the darkest hour of the night comes just before the dawn. And as Harvey Dent promised you, the dawn was coming. It's here. In other words, It's time to really go and watch this film. No one is criticising it anymore. Because no need for that right now. The ones who intentionally downplayed it, well, they've served their purpose and were pretty good at it. Others are actually misguided or just misunderstood the darker tone as the film overindulging in the morbid atmosphere of ""Man of Steel"", (and since it's a BATMAN MOVIE!), when in fact it was paving a path for the more humorous Justice League. And in between you get the upcoming epic: Wonder Woman. History was just in the making but in a way we weren't familiar with.As populist effigies go, the aloof, out-of-touch critic who who dismisses popular entertainment in favour of high-minded so-called ""art"" that only they understand (or care about) is pretty evergreen – mostly because, like any good myth, it has one foot in reality. The business of entertainment reporting and cultural-criticism are such that critics are required to experience hundreds of films (or books, or games, or whatever other discipline) throughout the year, and thus grow more quickly tired of clichés and more sensitive to technical flaws. Plus, sometimes critics really do get it wrong. It took the ""establishment"" film press around 3-4 sequels to notice that the Fast & Furious franchise was delivering on diversity and (nominally) progressive post-traditional family-dynamics like few other mainstream films had dared, but global audiences had been rewarding it for that all along. Conversely, the perceived ""elitism"" of critics makes it easy for some to imagine them as powerful enough (or thinking themselves so) to use their platform to advance a nefarious agenda rather than critique from objectivity (whatever that means anymore(. That's the premise of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead (which Zack Snyder himself is angling to adapt into a new feature film) where the villain is an architecture critic who uses his influence to ruin the careers of artists in order to advance his own political/cultural worldview, and also of Ratatouille, where Anton Ego takes malevolent pride in destroying Gasteau in part because he objected to the chef's populist ""Anyone can cook!"" message.There are more than just a handful of brilliantly realised moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script (Affleck, Gadot, Cavill and Adams were superb but Affleck unexpectedly was the best!), and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; But Jesse Eisenberg's Luthor. . . Eisenberg's performance as the villainous Lex Luthor (Check: he was playing Lex Luthor right?) was, you know, not what I'd encourage, he literally JOKER-ed the SUPER out of the Villain! While it wasn't the worst but it did manage to break the film down a little. But was it really his performance that ruined the movie altogether before it even came out?Look: I get where he was coming from in his approach to his character. After all, he's playing a super-crazy villain with super- crazy mental problems. But every stutter, every tick felt very calculated and clichéd, as if he'd crafted his performance after taking a class in Super-villains 101. Ultimately, though, this one may be on director Zack Snyder. A more nuanced actor's director, like, say, Darren Aronofsky, might have saved the movie by asking Eisenberg to take it down a notch. Letting him run wild just didn't work.Now, why would you Rip-off of Heath Ledger's Joker? Or if not, why wouldn't you notice the damn fact that you're unintentionally Ripping a Clown off?Perhaps it was because Dawn of Justice is at least half a Batman movie, perhaps it was because The Dark Knight was just really freaking' good. Whatever the case, it was hard to watch Eisenberg's performance and not think back to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's modern-day superhero classic. Eisenberg's speech patterns and mannerisms felt almost entirely lifted from Ledger's iconic performance, to the point where he walked the dangerous grey line between respectful homage and downright thievery. We understand why Eisenberg might have wanted to go that route; after all, Ledger won an Oscar for his performance, and set the bar extremely high for all super-villains to come. Still, the whole thing felt too familiar. In any other movie Eisenberg would've gotten a decent share of praise for his performance but this wasn't any other movie. It was the biggest film DC ever made. It's a Batman movie. It's a Superman movie. It's the best film we've been lucky enough to witness first hand.While it still deserved it's fair share of praise. Especially due to Ben Affleck's 'badass' portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Batman ruled.Comic books are, first and foremost, a visual medium. Such importance placed on making a good-looking project should translate over to films that adapt these stories for the big screen. While the phrase ""style over substance"" holds a lot of merit, it should not impede efforts by filmmakers to translate images to the big screen in a way that resonates with audiences. Zack Snyder was trying to create a visceral experience that would not be forgotten, and he did accomplish this. Love it or hate it. AND the DVD fleshes out subplots and adds the much needed restoration of the cuts and character beats and yes, the additional scenes. Not only did the new cut feature additional footage, it also changed the rating of the movie to an ""R"" from ""PG- 13"" as several more brutal story beats were brought to light.This is a late review for the ones who haven't seen it yet. (Try to get the DVD and go see it now!)"
" The Epic Superhero Showdown
",0.0,0.9747,2017-04-28 00:00:00,9,"Henry Cavill has proved he is the Superman of the years to come, not a one time flop like Brandon Routh and worthy of the level of Christopher Reeve. Ben Affleck begins his task of taking over the cape and cowl from perhaps the greatest actor to ever play Batman in Christian Bale. I still felt WB/DC could've just moved forward with Bale's Batman, having him come out of retirement following the events of General Zod's world takeover attempt in Metropolis in 'Man of Steel'. However, they felt differently and being someone who wanted Bale back and didn't want Affleck as Batman, in the end I felt he was a very solid Batman/Bruce Wayne.The story is solid, rushed at points and sometimes tough to follow. I saw this in the theater opening weekend and just finished the Ultimate Edition for the first time tonight. The Ultimate Edition is certainly superior and explains more about the plot. I liked both versions equally nonetheless. The movie falls victim to a lot of hate common to our times on the internet. The fight between Batman and Superman is impressive and better than either Batman versus Bane fight in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman versus Doomsday is also very well done and entertaining. I'm not a comic book guru who nitpicks all the details, but Doomsday was like King Kong from hell. I enjoyed watching the future Justice League scramble to stop him. Jesse Eisenberg isn't the perfect Lex Luthor, he isn't Gene Hackman but he's better than Kevin Spacey was. In the late 1990s, I always felt Billy Zane would've been the perfect Luthor. Eisenberg is the Lex Luthor version of Mark Zuckerberg, who he also portrayed in 'The Social Network'. That's where I believe the studio wanted to go with Luthor in this DC Universe. A more modern, young, rich whiz kid who owns his own corporate empire. I completely understand what they were going for and honestly... I enjoyed the fresh interpretation.I'd say by Batman standards it's behind 'The Dark Knight Trilogy', equal to 'Batman' (1989) and 'Batman Returns' but better than 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman & Robin' by miles. By Superman standards it's on par with 'Superman: The Movie', 'Superman II' and 'Man of Steel' but better than III or IV from the Reeve era or 'Superman Returns'."
" One of My All Time Favorite Movies
",0.4588,0.9964,2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea how this received such bad reviews. The action in it was awesome and they set it up long-term for a great Marvel-esk type plot in the future. Personally, I thought the movie was a knock out of the park and some of you people are way too critical about tiny things and just agree with the movie critics because they criticize about the smallest details and that they are simply movie critics. It was extremely entertaining, dark, and how I'd personally like a superhero movie to be made. Ben Affleck was amazing in his role as Batman. Christian Bale was also amazing, but Ben Affleck had one movie to make the character right and did it in an amazingly, dark way. While everyone thinks Batman doesn't kill because of the movies before it, he definitely does and I believe this movie portrayed this in the right way. Henry Cavilli is the perfect Supermam, no matter what everyone says about the end of Man of Steel. It was necessary and dark in all the right ways at the time and was, in my eyes, a great way to go with both films for him. The ""Jar"" was an amazing scene in general and was doubtfully predicted by anyone. Even the most criticized person, Jesse Eisenberg, did a great job and was sinister to the very end. While comic book fans might not agree with me, he portrayed a great Luthor not because he was doing it for profit, but obviously in a way that was supposed to benefit him in the long-term future. To me, Zach Snyder has done a wonderful job with his films, making them thematically great and amusing to watch. The knit-picking needs to stop at a point and just enjoy a good movie. This is an exceptional part of one of those films and deserves praise rather than hate."

" Out of Character
",0.0,-0.9909,2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"There had been a lot of Marvel superhero characters out there, but my personal favorite had always been DC's Superman and Batman. To see 2 strong opponent in one movie got me highly anticipated, but the movie, very disappointingly, was really really bad.It took almost half movie, with just events no interactions, to just bring the 2 protagonists together. Batman takes hatred against Superman because he killed a village with his shock wave when he landed. Superman takes hatred against Batman because he brands the criminals he captured with his Batman logo. Come on, don't be ridiculous, is any of those things a Superman or Batman would do, at all? Do the script writer just make up some psycho characters that no one has seen on screen before? People inside the movie and watching the movie would just buy it? And some add-ups like Batman's office building was smashed as a collateral damage and a court house was exploded that was not even done by Superman. And superman took on the fight cause Lex Luthor wanted him to, just to put on a show, cause he captured Superman's mum, how stupid and old plot point is that. It's just horrible writing. And they stopped because Superman was screaming his mother's name, the Batman's mother had a same name! It's just bizarre to see such thing happen in a movie, how did the script even pass greenlight. And later, the 2, plus Wonderwoman, who doesn't really need to show up in this movie, went on to fight, the stupidest antagonist that doesn't have any motivation, strategy or empathy, a huge ""invincible"" monster.To my all time favorite studio WB, please, don't make a movie if you don't have a good story to tell, no matter how much you wanna see the characters do the things that you want them to do, they have to do them themselves. And don't just smash all DC superheros together just because Marvel did it, Avengers has been going on for years, please go create something new. Don't forget the Superheroes are real lives in the movies, they can be inter-connected/effected in the ways they didn't even know, look into it. And, above all, best regards to the inspiring movies like The Matrix.It's been a year since I watched Batman v Superman but too lazy to write a review and finally write it here as above."

Those who liked the film actually fall into the majority no matter which review aggregating website you visit, but you wouldn't know that by how forced the negative opinion has been. Let's get one thing straight, the plot and pacing of the movie is not its strong suit, but it is helped by the extended cut release. If you haven't seen this movie and are reading this hoping for some clarity sorry, but you've probably already made up your mind already, just know that if your a fan of Batman and/or Superman you'll enjoy the movie much more because of that."
" Uncle Zack's bootleg Batman and Superman figures! Batteries not included.
",0.0,-0.9921,2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Sigh...I can't get over how weird and nightmarish this movie is. It reminds me of the Tom & Jerry cartoons by Gene Deitch. Sure, the characters on the screen look like Tom & Jerry, but they don't act like them. It's like that time when your uncle gave you one of those cheap bootleg Batman figures (Bat-Cop, Bat Detective etc) for Christmas. It just felt wrong.Batman is based on the grumpy old sadist from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (how original), only more violent. He makes Keaton's Batman look like Gandhi. He also looks unintentionally hilarious with the huge, fake muscles on the suit. A more expensive version of the ones little boys wear when they play Batman. I bet there's a deleted scene out there where he glues fake hair on his chest and puts socks in his underpants too.And Superman...I can't even remember any of Superman's lines. The only thing I remember is Henry Cavill standing there looking tired and annoyed. He's just there to be killed off by Doomsday.BvS feels more like a horror film than a superhero film. Dark, disturbing, nihilistic...I don't think superhero films should make people depressed. They even have the overrated Neil DeGrasse Tyson show up and tell us how meaningless life is and how worthless we (humans) are. I feel especially bad for all the kids who saw it. I heard one boy say to his mother: ""I think it's scary"". I wonder what they thought when they saw the parademons? ""Why did the scary ninja cockroach kick Batman's butt?""Skip this crap and watch a real superhero movie instead, like Superman 1978 or Spider- Man 2."

I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.In the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.Let me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a f... joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a f... CIA agent? You got to be f... kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.Same stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.Weird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.Oh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?I had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman's car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.Okay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.I am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don't like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it."

Parts of the are interesting like the Lois Lane side story but the other parts of the story reveal the conclusion to the side plot so it become boring and drawn out. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL do an amazing job with the music and in my opinion is their best yet. Most of the stuff pertaining to Batman is done great. For example the interaction between Alfred and Bruce is great , and it helps that Affleck and Jeremy Irons have good chemistry throughout the movie. Wonder Woman is amazing they basically rip her character out of the comics and Gal Gadot is a pretty good actor. The Action scenes are done pretty well.Now lets get on to the bad things. Superman is my least favorite part of this movie because he doesn't work as a dark character. There is no character development with most of the characters. Most of the dialogue in this movie wasn't very good. Most characters in this movie are terrible (like Superman and Lex Luthor). The dark tone wasn't really needed with most characters and out of all of the characters Batman is really the only character who works 100% as a dark character. Doomsday wasn't a good villain and didn't really have any reasons to be there. I think Lex should have started creating him in this movie and he is finished in MOS2 and that's where they would do the death of superman story line. And some of the editing between scenes doesn't makes sense.In the end Batman V Superman isn't the worst superhero movie ever but it's convoluted and boring at times. However if you're looking for a way to throw away time and be decently entertained I do suggest that you watch this movie."

The movie is basically a sequel of Man of Steel with some in society blaming Superman for the collateral damage when he fought General Zod. Among his detractors is Bruce Wayne who does not trust an alien. Clark Kent on the other hand is concerned that Batman has a license to kill in Gotham City and wants things done by the book. Lex Luthor plays into this animosity be egging each side on.BvS is an awesome movie. I highly recommend the Director's Cut as it explains more and is a bit darker. The acting and the action scenes are praiseworthy and the dramatic ending sets this movie apart from the majority of Marvel movies. Some did not understand the movie and hence gave the film a low score but for those who are paying attention and willing to reflect on the movie it is an awesome spectacle. This is not a simple movie, as it requires one to think and put the pieces in place. If you are willing to do that then the movie will be a fantastic experience for you.Jackal"
" ""People fear what they don't understand""
",-0.4939,0.9995,2017-04-10 00:00:00,9,"Ultimate edition reviewBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a cinematic masterpiece. It's artistic and bold take on the superhero genre paves a path seeded with deeper meanings for comic book movies. This part political thriller, part superhero action epic takes a hard look at reality and delivers a hyper-stylized clash between iconic characters that is truly ground breaking.The story is many things melded into a clever and engaging epic. The film tells a story from the point of view of not only Batman and Superman, but also the world. It is dense, but every scene is executed so well and feels important. From the very opening scene, this film is a stunning reinvention and introduction to this new version of Batman. It also connects so well the the universe as a whole, leaving breadcrumbs for more to come. I truly cannot talk about this film without the depth that it deserves without delving deep into spoilers so I'll just say this: The whole story is magnificent and congregates in an intense and gripping third act. But it also leaves some loose threads that hint at the expanding universe. This film connects so intimately to the previous installment Man of Steel, and I think that is one of its strengths. I really felt like these movies are all one big story.This version of Batman is the 2nd best one yet. Ben Affleck gives a performance that makes the Bruce Wayne/Batman character feel new, but still honours the core of the character that most previous performances captured so well. His Bruce Wayne is charming, snarky and really damn sexy. His delivery of each and every line feels as though Bruce Wayne is real and exists. But Affleck's Batman is even better. This Batman is brutal, muscular and more broody than ever. It is incredible to watch. Every time Ben Affleck is on screen, with the costume on, he is scary. A good scary. Watching him felt like I was a guilty crook stuck in a dark alleyway. This older, brutal and more stylized version of Batman is compelling to watch. His arc of redemption throughout the film is misunderstood by many, but it truly is so amazing. You really get to feel much more with this version of Batman than any other. His journey throughout is such an enjoyable watch.Henry Cavill continues his role as Superman and is fantastic. This film explores the Clark Kent reporter side much more and Cavill plays it perfectly. This Clark Kent is smart, determined and charmingly nerdy. I think there is much less of a difference between the two personas of Kal-El, but I feel it's more realistic. His Superman performance is just as great as it was in Man of Steel . In this film we get to see more of how Superman is seen by the public and how he reacts to it. Cavill expresses such powerful emotions when dealing with the way Clark reacts to his public image. It is so genuine and you feel a more emotional impact with Superman's actions. But the essence of Superman is still kept, because even through all the hardships and doubt he faces throughout this film, he still does the right thing. He is still good. This universe is definitely set in a darker, more harsh world, which reflects that of own. But there is a visible light and this film works its way towards that.The action sequences in this film are gorgeous. Every shot is absolutely breathtaking and courtesy of cinematographer Larry Fong. The use of color perfectly reflects the tone of the film and delivers beautifully in epic action sequences. As this is a very visual film, the cinematography plays a significant part in telling the story. Each shot has so much detail that just enhances what is going on in the plot. Incredible thought and work has gone in to create a world in which this story is integrated in.Hans Zimmer and Tom Holkenberg created the score for this film and it truly shines. The music is just fantastic and has a very orchestral, epic theme to it. Each track is crafted well for each scene, but where the score really shines is the character themes. The themes for Batman, Superman and Lex Luthor were all so well done. They fit with the characters and are so memorable. But the absolute stand out theme was Wonder Woman's. The electric cello that bursts into your ears with an epic riff is just heaven. I found myself listening to that track the most.This is such a beautiful film. It totally deconstructs what a superhero comic book movie is and turns it into a deeply philosophical commentary on the world today. Using two iconic characters and putting them in the premise of this film worked so well. Although there are some minor scenes that were unnecessary and moments that could have been executed better, this film was so enjoyable to watch. It is on such an epic scale and is so different from the regular bunch of comic book movies, it is such a breath of fresh air. I could not recommend this movie enough, it is incredible."
" Extended over Theatrical
",0.0,-0.081,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie has alotta heart although, it can be extremely difficult to follow the story because of the way it was edited for the theatrical release. The extended version is really the only version people should see if they want to actually understand whats going on. By adding more time, they build the characters more and allow the viewer more time to grasp all of the different back stories that are going on."

The only reason this has two stars, was because of doomsday. he was cool, and earned this movie both of those stars alone. all in all, don't watch this movie. go see what they are trying to rip off, avengers civil war."
" Good moments but poor story line and execution
",-0.4939,0.8807,2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"I eagerly awaited this film, what could be better than seeing Superman and Batman face off. I was sadly disappointed. The fundamental flaw with this film is director Zac Snyder strives to create moments in the film rather than focus on a coherent set of scenes and story line. We some great moments and photography such as Bruce visiting his parents grave but these moments lack gravitas and substance because we haven't seen the journey to that moment. A good story line and powerful scenes can build up to an epic moment in the film. The audience will understand it and feel it because it has geared towards this moment through well acted scenes and stories. This why I felt the film was disjointed because it lacked sufficient scenes and executed story line to arrive at epic moments. Moments don't exist by themselves, they are the result of key scenes woven together. Synder does not seem to follow this concept and hence we saw a disjointed film that received a mixed reaction. It is sad to see DC be humbled and dominated so much by the Marvel universe that has created many characters people connect with. DC has created distant characters. Zac Snyder should be replaced in making these films by another director as Man of Steel had the same formula like this film."

",-0.3612,-0.9237,2017-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Quite simply, this movie proves the maxim that the more Hollywood stars a movie has, the worse it is. Globally bad acting, thanks to an almost complete lack of believable character development. Poor Amy Adams must have taken this script a knife point. Even her transcendent light can't overcome the dullness of this dud. The sound is, of course overbearing, but then again it needs to be to keep the audience from slipping into a coma. The cinematography, the set design and the makeup are all atrocious. Ben Affleck is wooden, Jesse Eisenberg mailed it in and runs over his lines. The cgi is excessive and poorly done. It simply has no redeeming value. It's painful to watch such a vast waste of time, money and talent. I feel like I need one of those nuclear worker scrub down showers to get the stink off of me. Just pitiful!"
" I loved it!!!
",0.6981,0.9902,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, I don't know why people are hating this movie. I know people will laugh at me when I will say that I was more excited to see Ben Affleck as Batman! I liked him as an actor and seeing one of your favourite actor playing the role of a superhero whom you love the most is more than being excited! I was bit skeptical about Gal though. But she proved me wrong. Apart Ben, she was the only reason why I loved this movie the most. I admit, the story and movie's length and pace were the weak points but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. Direction was OK. Action scenes were awesome. And the part I liked the most was when the Trinity of Justice League, the trio which makes DC a legend in superhero genre, are fighting for the first time together in a live-adaptation. I feel superman was not up-to the mark here. Superman is hope. Hope that he will stand by us when we need him the most. Hope that he will save the world at the end of the day. And he does that but not as we would have expected him to do. Destruction is the negative point here. As seen in marvel recent movies, the destruction caused by superheroes is pointed out to them so that they can know what they are doing in the whack of saving this world. The last battle in the movie shows destruction which is enough to outcast them from this world for their entire life span. Still they are there, forming a league of meta humans to save the world from greater threats and leading to more destruction! I will recommend this movie for batman, for wonder woman and for the epic battle between The Two of the greatest superhero ever who are fighting to kill each other only to form a friendship which will last forever because of one name they share in common with each other, the name they love the most and for whom they care the most, the name, ""Martha!!!"""
" Epic Impression, Falling-Short!
",0.2942,0.8951,2017-04-03 00:00:00,6,"As profoundly been discussed thus far, the film did include some good plot-points, storyline and signature punch-lines; however, the narrative on the whole wasn't fascinating. It just felt like overwhelming VFX punctuating a multi-character action. Apart from the brief Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Batman and Superman (Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill) barely sustained intrigue. Lex Luther is cast well (Jesse Eisenberg) who felt more of a counterpart of the Nolan's ""Joker""; though he went a little overboard. Overall, they're likable but, not quite where they could be ""absorbed-to-the-core"" Super-Heroes.Although, the pre-intro fillers and the post-climax scenes paving way for ""Justice League"" ensured something to look forward towards; and I guess that Zack Snyder could make the game a lot better."
" A thorough and remarkable performance by Ben Affleck congested in an inconveniently slow paced movie
",0.5574,-0.3545,2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,"Make no mistake, batman v superman :dawn of justice is an astonishing picture , it proves conclusively that Zack Snyder is a visionary and a world class director, yet in spite of all the respect that I give for all his pictures, I contest deeply over one single small yet crucial detail : the excessive length. The movie was filled with unnecessary and annoyingly lengthy scenes. For example, all of superman's meaningless walks through the capitol building or the streets of New York were easily, and in my opinion harmlessly expendable. Those spare moments would have been creatively used by the director or the screen writer to shed more light on one of this movie's biggest triumphs: the batman. Ben Affleck's performance was by all means this movie's last and best hope. I hate to use one of this domain's most utilized expressions but his acting was incredible, and this was for him the ultimate challenge. Because before I watched BvS, I had seen the dark knight returns: one of the few animated movies that have deeply touched me. This old masterpiece was DC's last fascinating movie that had, unexpectedly, amazing voice acting. The resemblance between that movie and the one we are talking about is uncanny , it even follows the same story arc but with a few big changes that made the batman character more intriguing, because it is for the first time since Michael Keaton's unforgettable performance in Tim Burton 's dark fantasy, that we see batman killing without remorse, affirming that he is no longer the guardian that Gotham deserved. It seemed like the incorruptible knight has finally fallen to the temptations of taking a man's life and this in itself is extremely shocking, because something must of had shattered his values and I as everyone who have seen the movie are craving to know what forced this man to show such brutality and despair. That's why Alfred pennyworth ,played by Jeremy irons, is for me one of this movie's essential pillars: satirical though as he may seem Alfred is this time worried about the safety of his friend and master, because the world has gone crazy since the arrival of the man of steel, whose mere existence in this movie ruined it for me . Henry cavil had his glorious moments and will undoubtedly have even more, but this movie is by far not one of them. In the time when every single member of the cast had shown a spark of good acting, Henry cavil exhibited such coldness and passiveness that he turned to be unworthy of this movies time, unfortunately he was there in every moment and every scene to the point that I started to doubt his acting skills In a nutshell, this movie might have been this year's biggest disappointment as the majority of the critics had confirmed .And I approve with certainty that this movie was the victim of poor editing and rushed screen writing, but at least showed us the bright side: the future of the dark knight is in safe hands."
" Boring-man vs Stuporman: dawn of who gives a crap
",-0.3818,-0.9241,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"I want my money back. All of it. I will take a check, or Bit-coin or stamps or cigarettes or in some other form of currency, but absolutely, I want my money back. Jesse Eisenberg should be fired from acting or Zack Snyder should be fired from directing or you could fire both of them, I can live with that. Way too serious for an all white cast forced to play cartoon superheroes, levity would have helped were the writers capable of crafting jokes. This movie desperately wanted to compete with the Avengers movies and failed and for the record the Avengers movies were very mediocre, very very very mediocre, a low water mark. Let artists make art, you chumps should stick to whatever it is chumps are good at doing, I don't know what chumps are good at."
" A Battle to the Death
",-0.7579,-0.5388,2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie essentially begins where the film ""Man of Steel"" ended except that it comes from the point-of-view of ""Batman"" (Ben Affleck) and all he is seeing is the carnage left in Superman's wake. On the other hand, ""Superman"" (Henry Cavill) has become aware of the actions of Batman and he doesn't like what he considers him to be--a dark and sinister vigilante operating outside the boundaries of the legal system. Meanwhile, a psychotic genius named ""Lex Luthor"" (Jesse Eisenberg) has his own plan to kill Superman and it involves manipulating Batman to do the job for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that comic book fans who enjoy action-packed films will probably like this movie. However, it is not without its faults. For starters, it had a number of different sub-plots which weren't allowed to develop due to the multitude of action scenes. Additionally, while the character of Batman thrives in a dark and gloomy setting, I don't believe that it suits Superman nearly as much and it remains to be seen whether the director (Zach Snyder) fully appreciates that. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, regardless of the flaws I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Louis Lane has to be killed off
",-0.6705,-0.8381,2017-03-31 00:00:00,6,"She was the weakest link in the entire cast. That's including all the extras as well. The actor definitely played the part she was told to, but unfortunately the character just brings the entire movie down. It almost feels as if her character was forced into the script. She just ruins the entire tone of the movie. I just really dislike the character as she is portrayed in the movie. Would have preferred more wonder woman in all honesty or a further exploration of the relationship Clark has with his mother. More importantly, if Louis does get killed off, imagine the beautiful character development we could see in superman. The injustice time line would be feasible. Creating for an entirely enticing concept with limitless potential. Movie still dope doe, just not az dope."

",-0.171,0.9699,2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Right of the bat I have to state that I LOVE Superman. My favorite comic book character and all time #1 superhero. Man of Steel was hugely refreshing to me in that we were finally shown a proper glimpse of the SPEED and POWER that Superman possesses. As great as Superman: The Movie was in its time, I was always disappointed that they portrayed superman as being weak and slow for someone that was supposed to be ""Faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive"" I found myself thinking, this is more like ""above-average"" Man rather than ""Super"" man so when MOS came along, I was over the moon at the way his feats of speed and strength was captured. I felt that Batman v Superman built on this by also showing how powerful batman can be when fighting for his life, not getting his back broken by some fat guy with a cheap Darth Vader voice changer. I can see why some people criticized the story which I actually enjoyed, but honestly, you don't really watch a superhero film for the story, it is about the Action scenes and BVS absolutely killed it in this department!!! Batman at the warehouse the best live action Batman fight ever but the one part that hooked me in was the part *** SPOILER ALERT *** where Batman is punching Superman in the face and bit by bit, Supes' strength returns.... EPIC moment of showing how powerful superman is!!!"
" Do a movie, not a franchise
",0.0,0.8534,2017-03-27 00:00:00,4,"First of all, I wanted to like this picture. I'm in the minority who actually liked Man of Steel and appreciate Snyder for trying something different.I also don't care about the ridiculous Marvel v DC feud. I just enjoy good comics and movies. However, after Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad I'm just about ready to give up on this line of movies, because they (and Suicide Squad in particular) were horrendous.That said, I don't know who does the casting for the Justice League series, but they must be doing it on a dare and failing miserably at it, from Jared Leto and Viola Davis in Suicide Squad to Jesse Eisenberg and Gal Gadot in Batman v Superman. Gadot is pretty to look at, but she's a horrible actress. First of all I can barely understand what she says, and when I do the delivery is so wooden and dull it makes Keanu Reeves seem like a master thespian in comparison.I don't know what part they told Jesse Eisenberg he was playing, but surely it couldn't have been Lex Luthor. Considering the amount of scenery he was chewing, he must have the digestive system of a thousand goats. The saving grace is Ben Affleck as Batman. He is fantastic in this picture.The plot is nonsensical and only serves as a 2+ hour set up for gathering the other Pokemon in the Justice League, something which came off as tacked on and contrived. I have only seen the extended version, but considering how disjointed that felt I can only imagine what a jumbled mess the theatrical version must have been. Just think of what this movie this could have been if they had ditched the obligatory franchise building and focused on telling a contained story. The callback to Man of Steel which explains the animosity between Batman and Superman is excellent and a great starting point. But after that they can't decide whether to tell this story or the beginning of a handful of other stories which will (maybe) pay off in later movies in the franchise."
" An OK film
",0.4466,-0.8796,2017-03-25 00:00:00,5,"The film is alright, but I was frustrated watching the whole thing.First off, I feel like just about every batman movie I've seen as started off the same way, or had a similar scene in it regarding his parents funeral. I get maybe some people have no clue what Batman is about, but it doesn't mean we have to see it in each movie.Secondly the choice for Lex Luther bothered me. I've seen better adaptions of the character that I felt would've felt better with this film. I couldn't help think of the joker every time he spoke, instead of Lex Luther.3rd I've just never been a fan of Ben Affleck playing Batman. I always try to put that aside watching these, but it always gets to me.These didn't really take away from the story line for me, but there were plenty of events that occurred that made me think, Seriously?! The think that got me the most, was seeing Superman surviving a nuclear blast in space, however he gets stabbed after the fact and that's what ""kills"" him in the end. I don't think he is really dead, but they did a full military funeral for him and tried to play it off like he was. I guess we will find out though."

" The marketing is what messed the movie up.....BIG TIME.
",-0.34,0.9987,2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Having seen the Ultimate Cut of the movie I have to say that this was the film that should've came to theaters. The story makes so much more sense and actually adds some weight to the plot. Why it couldn't have been that way well...I blame the marketing 100%.First off let's take the title for instance. Yes the film includes Batman and Superman and their objectives, but the overall film really isn't about them fighting. Do they fight yes. For the reasons you think, absolutely not. Them having problems with each other I believe do move the story forward and add to what happened in the previous MOS. However the basis of the title 'Batman v Superman's for what it is trying to do is very inaccurate. Not only does the fight end just short of that epic oomph we all wanted, it does nothing to bring that weight of importance for the entire film. It's just sort of....is... Which is fine. But to call a film BvS as if that scene is central to the plot and it's entirety is just plain bait and gives audiences more of a reason to complain. Dawn of Justice would've sufficed and when you watch it you'll see why.Second, the trailers. I unfortunately saw all 3 of the trailers before the film released and when I went to the theater I was hoping for something that would surprise me and leave me speechless....and I wasn't. The trailers sold all the big cool points of the movie and kills the euphoria of seeing the highlights of the film. Doomsday I think was a great choice for the story and final showdown. So why the hell would you put his entire presence and all his glory in the trailer for us to look at. If they kept him out of sight I would've been all around excited. Say what you will about his CGI but I believe had they used him as a major hidden character to sweep the rug from its viewers it possibly could've been forgiven. Instead they show him and the three heroes together ready for a final showdown. Which leads me to my next point...Wonder woman. Now I'm not saying she shouldn't have been in the movie. Not at all. But in the film Gal Gadot's character steals the show without a doubt. Seeing WONDER WOMAN of all superheroes on the big screen and in action was not only a very pleasant surprise, but a dream come true. I can only imagine what I would've felt like if I DIDN'T know she was in the movie and revealed in as epic fashion as she was in the Ultimate Cut. But no, that hidden gem was all over the place. In the posters, trailers, Internet, even the Blu-ray box art. The FREAKING BOX ART. Why! The movie is called BVS for God's sake. They practically are telling me that instead of two heroes fighting, it's in fact 3. That does nothing but tell me what to expect and kills any chance of me giving it a standing ovation just like there was in a very early screening for the studios before trailers were even released. She's the best parts of the movie when the film isn't even ABOUT her. Whoever thought putting her face all over the marketing prints to be a selling point should be fired in my opinion. With respect to Civil War, there's a character that was revealed in one trailer for like 5 secs and that was it. When I saw the movie he stole that one whole major 15 min scene and I indeed was jumping for joy shamelessly in front of my friends because marvel did a terrific job keeping his presence under wraps. And the box art doesn't even show a lick of him keeping me oblivious the entire time. The box art for BvS spoils the best part for the film which in my opinion is the dumbest idea EVER and embarrassing for the fans that have been wanting a Wonder woman forever. Showing her glory like a unwrapped Xmas gift would've have been epic to say the least and it's quite a shame. Having said all that the movie was very entertaining and honestly not as bad as critics and some others are saying. There's great action, great casting, great characters and even a great story (given you watch the Ultimate Edition. Please do) and it definitely is better than MoS in almost all cases. I think Snyder did a great job and can't wait for the JL movie. The only thing disappointing is that the marketing spoiled it all and left me wanted more and didn't get it. I got what was given to me. Which isn't a good thing. I urge you that if you're excited or even a tad curious for what the JL movie could bring I'd will stay away from his trailers in the future for that one."

",0.5267,0.8958,2017-03-09 00:00:00,1,"What can I say? DC have done it again. Spent millions of unnecessary dollars on a couple of caped idiots fighting over nothing. Well done! I mean that. Well done me for not going to see 2+ hrs of yet more explosions with no storyline at the cinema. Trust me when I say I would have demanded every hard earned penny back. I learnt my lesson from the last time with Man of Steel and that was only slightly better than this dud. I really don't understand how a relatively simple original story can be taken to the planet of nowhere special. This was just yawnsville at its best. It's the usual. Two overblown male egos fighting for dominance, to rid the planet of baddies and destroying it in the process. Yeah, that makes perfect sense, what was I thinking? It's obviously me at fault here as we all know there's only 1 life in the whole city worth saving Superman, and that's your gal Lois Lane. Oh yeah! There was a random stranger trapped in a burning building, and when rescued, a crowd of delirious folk started fawning over him as they obviously weren't used to seeing someone other than Lois Lane being saved. Yeah, that must be it. Who thought of this so-called ""story""?? Well, no formal warning needed. Just fire him/her and do us all a favour. There was one comedy moment that our household laugh about even though it was supposed to be a pivotal scene. Batman has spent weeks pumping iron (and maybe a few steroids) his body's now buffed to perfection. He's just gotta kill Superman and has pulled out the stops to find his Achilles heel. Finally they meet. He's thrown old supe all over the place, battered him senseless, and was just about to give the fatal blow when.... wait for it... Superman utters the all important words: ""Find...Martha!!!!"" ""Why did you say that name??!!"" demands our batty friend repeatedly (camera cuts to the scene of mummy's death - AGAIN (yawn)). Lois saves her beloved by gushing ""it's his mother's name!"" so the batty one decides that he'll spare his life, and they are now lifelong friends. Just like that!!! Oh, how I laughed heartily!!! If only Superman knew the secret password was 'Martha' at the beginning it would have saved so much bother. The city would have been intact, the ozone less damaged and Lex Luthor's plans thwarted. Speaking of the bald-headed one. A raging psychopath? Really? Lex is supposed to be a white collared criminal genius, not a cold-blooded murderer. Just awful. But at least Batman got a chiselled bod out of it. So there's that I supposeThis rubbish takes itself far too seriously. I miss Chris Reeve's tongue in cheek Superhero. It's dated, with ropey special effects, but it's a classic that I still laugh at for the right reasons. Take a leaf out of Mavel's comic book DC and allow us a little light relief now and then I beg of youI wanted to award this tripe with zilch, but as there is no nil point, 1 would have to suffice, but I'm loathed to give it believe meDo yourself a favour.

Eisenberg, who I actually had high hopes for, does just another Zuckerberg type performance which doesn't make you feel like he could really be a problem for the Man of Steel.

" Watch The Ultimate Edition
",0.0,0.9778,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"PROS: The film is visually breathtaking and very reminiscent to Watchmen destructing the characters. Ben Affleck is the best live action Batman we've had so far. Batman's fighting style is just like in the comics, cartoon, and video games. It's cool seeing the events of Man of Steel from Bruce's perspective because it gives him motivation for hating Superman. The political and theological themes surrounding Superman are powerful. Henry Cavill is once again good as Clark Kent/Superman and it's cool seeing Clark Kent going to Gotham investigating Batman because it gives him good motivation for not liking Batman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is awesome and sexy. The fight between the trinity and Doomsday is dope. It's cool seeing cameos from the other Justice League members. The editing and pacing is much better than it was in the theatrical version. Lex's plan makes more sense than it did in the theatrical version portraying him as a puppet master. The Ultimate Edition makes more sense. The score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL is fantastic. The ending is very ballsy and emotional. CONS: Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor may still be over the top but he is more tolerable in the Ultimate Edition. There is a little too much Lois Lane in the final better. OVERALL: While it still may not be perfect, the Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition is a major improvement on the theatrical version, and for me it's one of the best comic book movies. SCORE: 9/10"

It's the 21st century reporters still use film cameras? I don't think so. The rest of the movie... Downhill. Hollywood as usual never reads the comics. It makes no sense that Batman is angry with Superman. It makes no sense that Superman is hurting people. A total waste of time of the talents of the actors. Don't go wasting money to go to the movie theater to see the film. Better rent it and have a stand by movie.... Laurel and hardy.

Anyways I don't get the hate the movie gets from critics and some people that claim to be true fans. Yes a lot is packed but the movie has its own stories told just like Pulp Fiction. It tell the story through Batman, Superman, Lex Luthor and Wonder Woman, now this may be confusing to the people who are new to DC or in general super hero movies, but if you pay attention you will understand the movie. So being a fan I understood everything but I can see why it may be to confusing for over people. I loved the movie 10/10."

I hated the dour tone and the colorless palette. I really don't even want to waste the time talking about all the problems with the story. This movie is so silly, it's been selected for review by podcasts dedicated to discussing bad movies. Anyone who wants to know how I felt about it can listen to any one of those dissections. I don't like the direction the DC films are going in and I wish they would stop making money so that the producers would rethink their approach."
" Built On Too Many Faulty Premises
",-0.3182,0.9911,2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"There is no criticism of ""Batman v Superman"" that the film or its creators cannot in some way rebuke. All they have to do is point to the box office totals. I get it. However, the money/hype this movie drives shouldn't be confused with the fact that, at its core, it isn't a very good movie at all. It was just brilliantly marketed and captured a wide swath of initial audiences. In dissecting the flick, though, one quickly discovers that it was built on too many faulty premises to succeed.For a basic plot summary, ""B v S"" sees Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) substantially angry that Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) caused so much destruction and collateral damage during his fight with Zod (Michael Shannon) at the end of the previous ""Man of Steel"" movie. This leads to some serious animosity between the two heroes, with Superman fighting his own battles of conscience while Batman schemes for revenge and justice. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tries to be a voice of reason, but with Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) whispering into the ear of both Clark & Bruce, the stage is quickly set for a confrontation. On the outside looking in is mysterious newcomer Diane Prince (Gal Gadot), who catches the eye of both men ends up a key player ""down the stretch"".Let me start with the one (and only) thing that ""B v S"" does right: Director Zack Snyder is an ""action man"", renowned for his ability to choreograph pulse-pounding fights and action sequences up on the big screen. So, the 20-25 minutes where this movie actually shifts into full- on action movie is pretty exciting and epic.Sadly, that is the only positive thing I took from the experience, as it is built on too many other faulty premises to even take seriously: -For a film that should have played to director Snyder's strong suits, why is so much time spent on character-building (an area where Snyder has no track record whatsoever)? Simply put, this should have been a ""Justice League"" movie right from the get-go. Instead, it put itself in the awkward position of trying to re-hash many of the old Bat/Supes tropes just because this was the film that was supposed to launch the ""DC Universe"" (after years of getting smoked by Marvel at the box office). What that means, though, is hours of character development from a director who doesn't know how to do it, leading to a bad situation. -Superman will never work as a ""dark"" character...it just isn't what the character was intended to be. You can't just copy-and-paste the Batman backstory onto Superman just because Christopher Nolan did it so well with Batman in his trilogy. This was readily apparent in ""Man of Steel"" and nothing has changed here. -So much of this film is set up for a Batman vs. Superman confrontation that will ultimately end in disappointment. There's a reason why this hasn't been tried on the big screen until now...because dramatically it just doesn't work. Too many predictability issues. Not helping matters is the fact that this sequence of the film ends with one of the lamest, most see-through ""revelations"" that I have ever seen on screen. -Eisenberg may be a decent Luthor...but most certainly not for this movie. I mean, why is he young when the entire rest of the universe is supposed to be older? It doesn't make sense in terms of story.Basically, here is what I think happened with ""B v S"": ""Man of Steel"" was just successful enough that Warner Brothers didn't want to upset the apple cart by changing directors. So, they stuck with Snyder even if it meant sacrificing story/characters going forward. To WB, it was strictly a financial investment, as they didn't want to start back at square one in their pursuit of Marvel. So, they stuck it out with Snyder and (at least on the surface) seemed to create a movie (at least based on the trailers) that would play to his strengths (action/fight scenes). Tease an epic confrontation, tease Wonder Woman, tease Justice League, and cut some great trailers to build hype. But when one gets down to ""brass tacks"", you find a film that didn't take any risks or bring anything new to the table. It had the perfect setup to be a big financial success, and the entire project was comfortable being exactly that, as if the bean-counters had more input into this film's construction then the creative people.Like I said at the beginning of this review, however, ""Batman vs Superman"" will be considered a success for Warner Brothers just for the sheer monetary numbers it will pull in. I can't argue with that line of thinking, and let's face it: I knew I probably wouldn't like this one (I didn't too much care for ""Man of Steel""), but I felt like I had to see it. As a longtime fan of Batman and Superman, it felt wrong to just ""not go"". My point is this: Let's not confuse financial success with creative success in the analysis of this movie. There are many other things and situations that go into selling movie tickets that are far beyond ""how good the movie is"". This film pulled out all the stops in that regard. That still doesn't make it a good movie.I'd give ""B v S"" 1.5 stars if I could (I save 1-star rankings for films that truly are abominations...although I considered it here). It scoots by on the bare minimum of creative storytelling or character development, instead letting its own ""hype machine"" determine its overall success. Fool me once, WB (""Man of Steel""), shame on you. Fool me twice (""B v S""), shame on me. Despite a mild fascination with the upcoming ""Suicide Squad"", I will definitely be skipping out on any further Justice League films with Snyder at the helm."
" Amazing movie!
",0.6239,-0.5145,2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Wow critics this time are way off. I don't get them one bit. By no means there are positive reviews from critics that appreciate this movie, but the rest of the critics that hated, have no idea what they are on about or they simply don't like superheroes and probably never read a comic book in they lives. This movie heavily is inspired from Frank Millers 'The Dark Knight Returns' and ask yourself this...how many of those critics have read that comic? Moving on this movie is made for the fans not the critics and that is true, you shouldn't make a movie to please the critics. The movie was successful but by no means a runaway success simply because of the unfair reviews from the critics. Some people believe they got paid to hate the movie, and some just couldn't wait to hate it, without even going open minded to watch the movie. This is not how it should work, if you will hate on it for no reason then please don't review the movie. Majority of the fans have liked it and I am one of them..in fact I loved it. If you take a look at the user ratings on IMDb, around 21% users gave the movie ratings raging from 1-5 (Terrible to average) and around 78% gave it 6-10 (Not bad to masterpiece) so I think that speaks for its self, obviously you will get people saying they are fake accounts and stuff like that...don't listen to them. When the movie came out people on Twitter have shared they feelings towards the movie...A article said that 10% didn't like it, 34% mixed feelings and 53% that enjoyed it. On Rotten Tomatoes there are loads of user reviews around the same as IMDb around 200-400 thousand and a 64% of users like it, and finally on Metacritic the user score sits on a nice 7.0. So what I'm trying to prove is that not all the people and fans liked it but majority did and that's important.Moving to the box office, the movie did not reach the 1 billion mark, but that doesn't make it a failure. Let's bare in mind the movie had a massive opening weekend and dropped of later in the weeks mostly because of critics, but the fans still went to see the movie. $872 million is not a pushover and some movie in the near future will not be making that kind of money. So the movie did pretty well at the box office thanks to the fans. My final verdict is that the movie was a success but could have been a better one if not for the bias critics."

When it comes to this movie in the words of Ben Affleck as Batman ""don't believe everything you hear son."" Because its awesome and does not receive the credit it deserves.Filled with amazing performances, especially Ben Affleck's dark and badass Batman! Seriously Ben Affleck absolutely KILLED it as Batman, he was just perfect in the role as a hardened and battle experienced Batman/Bruce Wayne. The film featured an in depth and layered story, thought provoking philosophical dialogue, a unique and psychotic new take on Lex Luthor and Henry Cavill continuing to dominate in the role of Superman by making him a more conflicted and relatable character (just like the comics), also Gal Gadot lights up the screen as Wonder Woman. Batman v Superman is a great comic book film but one for the intelligent viewer or one who wishes to be consumed by a more mature, dark, gritty and in depth movie rather than constant action. The action in this film however is also fantastic with awesome fight scenes, a great Batmobile chase and a jaw dropping ending. Zack Snyder with his great visuals and direction along with Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer created an amazing comic book film that will be talked about for years. Like movies like Blade Runner and 2001 this movie will be looked back on years later and opinions will be changed because in time people will realize this is just simply a great film...and a comic film truly ahead of its time."

I had the lowest expectations ever for this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was decently entertaining. I was sure that it would be a movie only built to advertise sequels, but happily it took the path of telling a complete (but not severely substantial) story. Many parts were cheesy and over dramatic, but how can you fault a superhero movie for that? Batman, Superman, Lex Luther, and Wonderwoman were all introduced well and became semi-interesting characters. The most intriguing aspect of the movie, however, was its ability to recruit nearly every Cable TV newscaster to make a brief cameo.

It seemed that they just tried to get too much into one movie. We pretty much know the background of Batman and Superman, so those sequences did little more than disrupt the flow of the movie. Some background on Wonder Woman might have been more useful. There were just too many characters and too many sub plots to have a movie with any character development or plot continuity. I am surprised that they did not send Aquaman in to save Lois Lane in the drowning scene. With the scope they tried to cover, this should have been a 2 part or trilogy event."
" Clumsy and obvious
",0.0,-0.8391,2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"I saw BvS under protest, because a friend wanted to do it for his birthday weekend. I think I may have set a record for how many times I checked the time on my phone, wondering how much longer this movie was going to go.This seemed to me like nothing more nor less than a clumsy attempt to catch up to Marvel's Avengers franchise and get a jump on Civil War. The problem is that, unlike the Marvel cinematic creative team, Snyder and the rest of DC's cinematic brain trust haven't done a thing to create the dichotomy between Superman and Batman that exists between Captain America and Iron Man. Superman, as he's been portrayed in the Snyderverse, is almost as dark and brooding as Batman, and when one character complains that ""(Superman) answers to no one,"" she could just as easily be talking about Batman.Three dream sequences in one movie is at least two too many, and three ""is he really dead"" moments for the same character is worse. I have to wonder if Snyder felt that the name recognition on the characters was high enough that he didn't need to delve too deeply into his bag of storytelling tricks, because he certainly didn't do so for this.Ben Affleck is very good as Batman--which shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone, Daredevil notwithstanding. Henry Cavill is just as good as what passes for Superman in this movie. But whether because of his own choices or because of how he's been directed, Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor delivers the most toxic performance I've seen since Tori Spelling in Trick. It is bad enough that every DC hero these days is trying to out-grim Batman; I do not need every DC villain to start trying to out-psychotic Joker.Another thing that bothers me is Wonder Woman--specifically, how she's been used in the DC Cinematic Universe. Gail Gadot is fierce as all hell as Diana, but I'm really not happy that Wonder Woman is in this movie.Marvel, in setting up the first Avengers movies, first gave us solo movies for what they considered to be their big guns--Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, the ones even non-comics readers would recognize. Hawkeye and Black Widow did not get such movies (although they both debuted in one of the aforementioned big guns' movies); they are considered to be secondary characters not on the level of the Big Four.Wonder Woman has not yet had a solo movie; having her make her cinematic debut here, in my mind, demotes her to the Hawkeye-Black Widow level, and the character, as one of the handful of superheroes to survive the Great Implosion of the late 1940s (when most superhero comics were either cancelled or reformatted) and as the most iconic female protagonist in any form of literature, deserves far better than that."

They are 2 different companies with 2 different styles. I prefer the serious and dark version which is DC. I loved this movie so much. The characters were amazing. The new Batman and Lex were so awesome. Ben Afflecks Batman needs to be in more movies. By far the best Batman ever. I loved that he was a big intimidating Batman. I loved the way he looked and sounded. I true old school Batman. It was a masterpiece. Then Lex came in. HE WAS AMAZING. loved the way he acted and his theme song was so good. Wonder Woman was a great add in. I just loved this whole movie. It was a true masterpiece. Only thing i wished they changed was the Batman and Superman fight. Wanted it to be longer but it was still a good fight. I believe in the DCEU. I am tired of the Marvel fan boys saying everything about this movie is crap. It was a good movie people. A good DC movie. Please make more like this.
" Maybe you just don't get it...
",0.0,-0.995,2017-02-14 00:00:00,9,"To me, the most perplexing thing about this movie is how a certain segment of the audience can't accept the Snyder/Batfleck version of Batman: older, more fanatical, hostile to the super powered alien who flattened Bruce Wayne's Metropolis business premises and killed members of his 'family', but who seem to have no issue with the Nolan/Bale interpretation of the character in 'Rises'; an imbecilic, mother-fixated physical wreck (and if you haven't even considered what the pearls might symbolise in that movie, please stop reading now!). For me, the BvS Batman is just another version of the iconic comic book hero; the director even appears to point this out by having 'his' Bruce Wayne witness a vision of a Batman in another reality; one in which the Man of Steel is very much an enemy, the 'point man' for an apocalyptic alien invasion. Personally, I appreciated the manner in which Snyder fuses the version of Arthurian legend from the 1981 movie 'Excalibur' with his Batman/Superman match up, even going so far as to set Bruce's batchelor pad on pretty much the same lakeside where Percival returns Excalibur to the water at the end of that movie(to the strains of 'Siegfried's Funeral March'). By paralleling Superman's death with that of King Arthur (both die fighting an 'abomination', Superman's demise mirroring Arthur's), we are left with the notion of Superman's 'return' when he will be most needed, setting up not only the coming JL movie, but also creating a repentant, redemptive character arc for Batman. The movie could have done with more inspired CGI, more widespread suspicion of Superman's motives in the background and more clarity on Luthor's exact motives (I personally think he was probably originally intended to be much more of a religious nut than a scheming billionaire, but I can see why that would have been toned down!). Also, I would have liked for the distinction between the liberal, elitist ultra-modern Metropolis and run-down, urban wasteland Gotham to have been more clearly defined. As for the 'Martha' moment, I didn't subscribe to the 'dumb and dumber' interpretation when I first saw the movie, and I still don't. Would the Batman of the reality of BvS have reacted to Superman's ultimatum (retire or you're dead) and Luthor's set-up the way he did? Certainly. Would he have relented when Superman's mention of his mother's name made sense of the 'bat-monster' dream, making him realise how far he'd fallen? Of course. And again, why was Snyder's treatment of Bruce Wayne's 'mother issues' pilloried by critics while Nolan's portrayal of a Bruce Wayne so mother-fixated that he: (a) ignores the danger of his stolen fingerprints while getting her pearls back and (b) forms no suspicion of 'Miranda' whatsoever despite the chain of coincidences that placed her in a position to hand over the fusion reactor to Bane? Would a dying man (even Superman) actually use his mother's name in that situation? No, but this is a movie. And isn't the use of 'the child of Ra's Al Ghul' to disguise 'Miranda's' true identity in 'Rises' just as contrived? Would Bruce Wayne seek to redeem himself by taking on the challenge of defending the Earth from the dangers to come? Definitely. That's my tuppence worth, anyway. Maybe I'm completely wrong or maybe, like the Nolanites who don't understand that 'Rises' is woefully written and plotted (or worse, blindly refuse to accept the fact) while levelling similar criticism at BvS, you just don't get it.NB: This review is for the Ultimate Cut."

Ben Affleck as Batman / Bruce Wayne plus Jeremy Irons are really the only decent things in this (Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White is good too, in the limited screen time he gets).I can give it a mark for some interesting concepts on holding superheroes accountable and showing the devastation that is left behind, but then they are only given lip service.The special effects are just laughable in places. In the the climatic showdown, there's not a shred of tension to be felt as CGI characters fly all over the place like a kids cartoon.Back in the day movies actually used to start out with a story and then a script. It didn't matter how big the villain was or how much destruction took place, if you built the characters up, wrote them well and wound the stakes up, it could make for exciting movies, irrespective of how good or bad the special effects were. The first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies (even, I think, number III as well) generated more thrills throughout at the merest fraction of a budget.Honestly, I think this maybe ties with Superman IV as the worst Superman movie (Man of Steel is only marginally better), and it's probably also level pegging with Batman and Robin as the worst movie to feature Batman.I would still be very interested to see the standalone Batman movie with Ben Affleck as he did a very good job with a poor script and poor story to make for a believable character.This won't stop the Justice League movement continuing and I'm sure this will turn out to be a money-making franchise for DC, but they are going to need to make far better movies if they want to take a place in movie history for the right reasons.In terms of big screen entertainment, this is just a very poorly put together movie (and I use the term movie loosely) and forgettable in so many ways (music, scenes, performances, script, effects).This one is for die-hard DC & comic book fans only."

How wrong I was.Firstly the ""unofficial"" DVD (bought in Malaysia) was over three hours long, and that is VERY long. I like long films, with the Director's Cut of Once Upon a Time in America being one of my favourite films.Secondly, and importantly, the film is an impenetrable mess. I suffered a stroke in 2002, and occasionally get confused with things, so I thought that it might be me, but after reading other reviews, there must either be a lot of stroke-victim reviewers or it is a (unintentionally) surreal shambles.Amy Adams was, of course, petite and lovely and even appeared naked in a bath - the tease. Elsewhere she was just a wee damsel-in-distress.Wonderwoman did nothing, and even if she had, the wrong actress was cast. Shannon Elizabeth or Megan Fox would have been better.Sometimes bad films are better the second time, so I may read the plot on Wikipedia and try again, but will be wary of Zack in the future.BTW, I forgot the worst character and actor; Lex Luthor and Jesse Eisenberg, who seemed to be doing an unsuccessful audition for The Joker.Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.Be afraid, be very afraid."

Bruce Wayne was personally affected by this when his building was decimated in the resulting destruction. Superman is found to be put under scrutiny by the government who hold him accountable for his actions. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is covertly smuggling a Kryptonian material, known as Kryptonite, into Metropolis in order to weaponize it. As both Superman and Batman pursue their own investigative forms of justification, they grow more and more hostile towards each other and the battle between man and god commences. Now I loved how dark the film was. Snyder has always had a way with visual splendor and he doesn't disappoint here. Some of my favorite scenes were when Superman was flying around the world saving civilians. This film constantly moves forward and has a feeling of precedence. Lastly, the music was incredible. Ben Affleck was great as Batman. The suit had a fantastic design and I really liked the robotic voice. I also surprisingly preferred Zack Snyder's Alfred better than any version of the character I've seen before. Alfred had more of a presence and a purpose in this version then in the previous installments. The handsome Henry Cavill has all of the right looks, but I sadly think he came off quite wooden in some of his scenes. The script certainly has its issue. The dialogue was well written but the problem was the direction of story. The writers should have completely scrapped the Doomsday plot line and focused on the main idea behind the film, the Ultimate clash between Superman and Batman. In the theatrical version, a lot of the plot lines weren't explained. However, in the Ultimate Edition, the story was far more coherent. The Ultimate Edition showed Clark's investigative reporting, scenes that were very much needed to explain his motivations. But the weird dream sequences, which did not have anything to do with the story, should have been removed to reduce the overblown length of the film. The briefing that was sent to Diana (Wonder Woman) was silly. Those scenes were simply a fan service and were obvious attempts of setting up the Justice League. And really, logos? Speaking of Wonder Woman, she felt like an incredibly underused character. The film eventually reaches its action CGI climax to remind us that this is a superhero film after all. Bottom line is that the Ultimate Edition really saved BvS for me after my disappointing view of the theatrical version. Let us not forget that despite the improvements, this film was good but not great."

The plot was very bland and somewhat predictable in some places despite some great visuals throughout and plenty of potential and it suffered from what I was afraid was going to happen; the movie focused too much on batman, Superman had fewer lines in his own movie than Spider-Man had in his brief 20-30 minutes on screen in ""Captain America: Civil War"" which is kind of embarrassing and makes Superman more of a cameo character than Spider-Man for their respective movies. Now despite my dislike of the character, I have to say Ben Affleck did a good job as batman he was certainly easier to understand than Christian Bale even with the voice changer in his costume, Henry Cavill again does a good job as Superman (despite his lack of lines) and Gal Gadot is of course on top form as Wonder Woman which certainly has me interested in her solo film coming out later this year. But while there are good casting choices there are bad and Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was exactly that, he was totally miscast he was so bratty and unlikable which has never been the case for me with Luthor, Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey's portrayals actually left me liking them when I should've hated them because they were the villains which is how I always saw the character; he's not an in your face kind of villain he's charming and cunning much like Loki in ""Avengers Assemble"" or Moriarty in the ""Sherlock"" TV show. I have seen the extended cut of the movie also and that alone has bumped up the score to 3 stars because while it makes the film better it doesn't blow me away. As I previously said, with two of the biggest comic book characters ever in the same movie fighting this should've been a great second entry into the DCEU and be on par with ""Captain America: Civil War"" but it fell flat and truth be told it feels like the only people who adore the movie and give it 10 stars are younger kids, hardcore batman or DC fanboys because when it comes to the best comic book movies of 2016, BvS isn't even in the top 3. I can only hope ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Justice League"" restores faith in the DCEU otherwise they are doomed to mediocre theatrical releases and extended cuts released on DVD and Blu-Ray"

Eighteen months later, Bruce as Batman has turned into the darkest of vigilante. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is investigating Batman while Superman is treated as either God or the ultimate threat. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets into trouble in Africa and Superman's rescue has raised questions about his omnipotence. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has gained access to Zod and the spaceship. He's looking to create anti-Superman weapons but Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) resists him. There is a new mystery woman (Gal Gadot) in the mix.Batman against Superman is a compelling idea which with a little finesse, should be a great story. The destruction of Gotham is a great starting point for Batman's distrust and hatred of Superman. Affleck in the midst of the destruction is a harrowing call back to 9-11. Instead of eighteen months later, Batman could be experimenting on ways to defend against aliens in the ruins of the city. The story is basically written already but for some reason, the various rewrites have mangled the story into a mess. Sticking Lex Luthor into the middle simply siphons out the intensity. The dialogue is also clunky. It may work better on a comic book page but it doesn't work when it comes out of the mouths of living, breathing people. More over, the editing is jagged. This could have been a comic book epic but there are too many little problems.EDIT: It took a couple of years but I finally got to the Ultimate Version. The extra thirty minutes allow the movie to breathe and the flow to be less jagged. The movie has all the pieces from the writing team of Terrio and Goyer. Instead of blaming all the many little problems on the disjointed editing, the plot is revealed to be full of conveniences, contrivances, and overblown melodrama. In a word, it is cartoonish which could fit a comic book movie. However, there is something more here. It took half the movie before I realized that this movie is written by the same self-important, conspiracy nuts who run their own YouTube channels. They know a lot of big words and big ideas but they string them together stretching logic to the breaking point to come to outrageous opinions disguised as common truths. It's a movie written by Lex Luthor with a crazy scheme that would never work in the real world.While I have ideas to restructure the whole movie, I do have one small change to fix one of the worst problems in the movie, the Martha conundrum. Superman should be saying, ""Save Martha Kent."" Nobody actually calls their mother by her name but Superman would say her full name so that Batman can have any hope to save her. Batman wouldn't be dumbfounded by the same name thing but he would still find the humanity in Superman that he would have a mother just like himself. If Martha gets fixed, at least the movie wouldn't be laughable. This version is better but it doesn't fix the deeper problems."
" Maybe not the best one but better than critics say
",-0.0346,-0.9982,2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"*Spoiler alert* I have never written the review before but now I have to. The reason is simple, unnecessary hate from critics and viewers.Firstly, many reasons may cause the ""film disaster"" like marketing of the film(a lot of spoilers in the trailer mainly), Warner Brothers pressure to make not only BvS movie but prequel to JL,theatrical cut, and huge expectation from fans. I understand that the fans could have been disappointed after watching the theatrical cut but that was the fault of WB, they've just cut off many important and essential scenes etc, so don't blame Zack Snyder for everything. Maybe panicking or competing with Marvel caused this?OK, I'm going to write only about ultimate cut. This movie shows something new, it shows how humanity would threat the superman. At first we would admire him and then start to feel helpless, because of his big strength. This is displayed in performance of Batman and Lex Luthor who created ""Doomsday"". The first part of the movie focuses on their motivations, Batman raising rage, Superman's investigation of Batman,Lex Luthor mad plan. Step by step Luthor pushed them into their fight and his back-up was Doomsday( I would prefer if they included f.e. Metallo but nah never mind). As I mentioned the first half was about their motivations, also new Batman was introduced. Some people ask, why Batman is killing in this film. The answer is simple. In this time line, Batman was fighting the criminals about 20 years, a lot of good people were gone, so he became the dark night of the streets with more brutal attitudes. The process took very long time it was not like ""ok from today I don't give a f*ck about my not- killing rule."" And many issues can be explained if viewers pay attention to the movie, especially to the ultimate cut. The second part. In this part we can see two fights. Superman and Batman. Many people complain and ask, why Batman wins.Here is a list: a) Superman didn't want to kill him. b) Batman used Kryptonite c) Batman was prepared If superman wanted to kill him, probably it would take 5 seconds. Superman had no clue about Kryptonite. Batman was preparing for long time, he developed his weapons. He didn't create bullets from Kryptonite, but only gus, which he did because he didn't want a short fight, and he wanted to Superman suffer before his death. As I said the ultimate cut solved a lot of problems. ""Martha scene"" I must mention it. Saying Martha to Batman it doesn't change his intend to kill you but the fact that Martha is his Earth mother does. In that moment he realized he is like his own enemies, like the murder who killed his parents that night. It is so simple to understand that but people are still b*tching about it. The trinity fight with Doomsday was excellent. Wonder woman was the part even Superman has his own highlight scenes. He survived the blast of the nuclear bomb and then he ""killed"" Doomsday. Overall this movie was pretty good, Batflack, Wonder Woman and even Superman (in the ultimate cut) were good done. Another pluses were the opening scene, the mankind problem with Superman, spectacular fights(both), visual orgasm, MUSIC etc. My only problems were cast for Lex Luthor, even though this actor will probably show us the true Luthor in the next films. And the fact that they wanted everything in one movie. They should have made MOS2 and then Justice League but never mind at least we don't have wait another years for Justice League. And very IMPORTANT fact, this movie wasn't about Batman or Superman or their epic fight but about changing their directions from the point where the film started and to the very end. f.e. Batman. During the movie he represents the broken man, angry, full of bad previous experience of people of Gotham, he even thought that superman is evil. Then he realized the truth and in the first place he was effected by Superman heroic sacrifice, which let him to change his mind and starting to create Justice League. Superman is another example. Humans started to fell fear from his power( very good interpretation of human nature), then he learnt Batman's methods and the truth about Lex Luthor and his evil plan. And at the end he sacrificed himself which ispired a lot of people around the globe. AND PLEASE DON'T JUDGE movie before it came out."
" Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice*********
",0.0,0.9924,2017-01-25 00:00:00,9,"If you were a fan of Zack Snyder's Man of Steel then you will definitely like this movie but this can be a controversial film to non- comic book fans or with mainstream fans, especially with this version of Batman. This version of him is very similar to Frank Miller's Batman from The Dark Knight Returns, an older & war-weary Batman. Overall, I love the film. To me, the story was masterful, dialogues were great (thanks to Chris Terrio), the visuals was absolutely stunning, and the Easter eggs was awesome. By the way Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman stole the show, she was astounding. Ben Affleck's performance is superb, to me, he is the BEST batman to date."
" Bad history but amazing special effects and great see Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.
",0.9343,0.7189,2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Almost 3 hours watching two superheroes fighting like two dogs with rage, without any sense. The only two things i can say about that this dumb movie has positive is that Jesse Eisenberg did very good role as Lex Luthor and that the special effects were incredible. Oh i forgot say also that another positive thing is that the beautiful actress Gal Gadot,came out as the wonder woman. And I think they really chose a good actress to play as the amazing wonder woman. And what else can I say? Only it would have been better to see Batman and Superman working together from the beginning or better to remove Batman and to have continued the story, only with Superman. Like the first movie, the man of steel. But well, it does not manage to surpass the history of captain America: civil war. But at least this Batman V Superman is more better than Legend of Tarzan, Independece Day: Resurgence and Suicide Squad."
" Everyone who hates this movie knows nothing about the comics
",-0.4404,-0.9929,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"First of Ben Affleck is an older batman and this is the Justice League batman not the dark knight. His take on Bruce Wayne is that of a darker Bruce Wayne how he is tormented about seeing his parents kill. In all other Batman movies this gets over looked. You see it at the start of the movies then its never seen again. SVB goes into the mental side of things. Superman For the first time a movie gets Superman Spot on. Asking the question ""why do i bother saving these people who go against me? He questions his moral right to save the plant. The scenes That makes it look like Superman is bad or turn bad are spot on.In the comic book Superman dose turn bad because Lois is killed by the Joker. Movie From the start to finish you know what is going on. In the comics Batman dose not wanna kill Superman. He just wants to let Superman know that if he becomes a threat he can be beaten. Batman is not a killer think of all the villain he lets live. He can never kill the joker for example no matter how much he is pushed. So he is not gonna kill Superman who is not a villain. Jesse Eisenberg Plays a true Lex. Rich hates daddy and dose not like Superman as he wants what Superman has. Power. Lex is Superman's Joker. He is the link between the two and set everything up. Wanted to see if Superman could kill Batman and corrupt him to show that he is not this all good he has bad in him. (Like the Joker wants Batman to kill him so he can show he is not as good as he says he is and can be bad )When Wonder woman appears it is not out of place as the film makes sure she is always in the movie so you know who she is. This was not the Justice league this was the start of it . The movie showed all who would be in in the new Justice League movie. The fight scenes are spot on. Brutal and tough.It did not cut any corners. People are so used to the Avengers. the one liners that are not needed. The good looking sexy heroes. If you watch this movie remember its not your typical pop movie and it was not made for the junkies who just want to go see a movie because its marketed every were and hyped up."
" Superman vs Godzilla
",0.0,-0.9795,2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"I promised myself after watching Man Of Steel (all being well) to steel myself and see just one more Dark Crap film and this was it, the 3 hour Dawn Of Justice Ultimate Edition. Is there a Coherent Edition out there too? I wasn't disappointed – as I expected I didn't enjoy it; I'll probably stick with light-hearted Marvel from now on for this kind of entertainment, because ultimately Time's running out.Batman has a lifelong violent grudge against Superman for being responsible for his parents' deaths and machinates to kill him for the first 150 minutes. Then, upon the utterance of a single word by Superman to the grunted astonishment of Batman all sins are forgiven for the final half hour and they become allies in attempting to defeat Evil. Unbelievable, they're living in a fantasy world if they expect us to swallow that! Then, the film nosedived from being mildly incoherent and boring into intensely incoherent and laughable. I thought the tinny music for the relentless multi-coloured patterns on the screen which were supposed to represent a cgi conflagration suited the Godzilla/Hobbit monster perfectly though – no doubt Warners owed any Asian backers something. There seemed to be more newspapers and TV news telling the ""story"" than usual – but do kids nowadays remember those antiquated types of news outlets? The film started and ended with gloomy grimy graveyards with much grunting and griping; there has to be an overarching moral there somewhere. And don't expect any light-bulb moments in here! Carnage is wreaked and Death would be stalking the Land for weeks afterwards but none of the twerps protecting the planet cared a fig about that. Affleck was fascinating with his ridiculous grunting, Cavill was a thoughtless sulky yob, Gadot should have been with someone else, I felt sorry for Amy Adams in yet another hopeless film.I grew up with the nonsensical 1960's Batman, but unfortunately these particular superheroes have been allowed to grow up superselfish and superfluous."
" So disappointing!
",-0.5838,-0.8475,2017-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Poorly written, horrible editing and even bad acting, but worse than that they completely changed the character of these superheroes. No one is likable... they are actually all irritating. You kind of just want to smack them... Batman/Bruce is a narcissist on a power trip and Superman/Clark is a boring, brooding sap. Lex Luthor, played by Eisenberg, is the only one with some personality albeit he's a spoiled, rich psychopath. The film is extremely disjointed and hard to follow, which makes you loose interest very early on. (My husband who loves action movies gave up after a little over an hour.) I read that they had to edit it down from 3+ hours and make it fit to a PG-13 rating, but even though that may be part of the blame it was still too dark, slow and pretentious. All the battles, explosions, and other special effects weren't enough to make it worth watching this 2½ hour fail in My Humble Opinion 5 stars. 1/2017"
" waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.8363,2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"WOW, what a waste of time. I convinced myself to watch this no-brainer. Nothing against ""popcorn"" cinema in general. I love watching some action-packed well made movie once in a while. But, what a piece of garbage this one is, and frankly not (as I feared) because of Ben Affleck as Batman. He actually did the ""best"" acting. But if you have Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther, Henry Cavill as Superman, or Jeremy Irons as Alfred... wtf? Is this a movie about worst choice for a role? ...it's like putting liberal idiot ""scientist"" Neil deGrasse Tyson in a movie ...oh wait. The story line, if you can even call it like that, has huge gabs and leaves lots unexplained, almost as the producers wanted to tell everything about both main characters but in the end failed by focusing on trivial stuff. This doesn't do either Batman nor Superman any justice. On the good side, I'm now at a level where I actually might try to watch the Ghostbusters remake, just to have something truly awful to wipe this from my mind."

" A Marvel fan's view.
",0.4215,-0.2468,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"To fess up straight away I absolutely hated Man Of Steel. Henry Cavill was a plank in it and the film itself was one long smash-up fest. So I avoided this movie when it came out. Normally I watch DC films, too as I have no hatred or bias against them. Just didn't like Man Of Steel! I watched with some trepidation the 3hr version of the film on blue-ray. The cinema cut was poorly reviewed by critics and disliked by many DC fans, so maybe this ""ultimate"" cut makes a difference. The first hour I found fairly dull, to be honest, but as the movie went on it got better and better, and I'm the first to say I find the critic's response somewhat mystifying - this is by no means a terrible movie overall. It has faults, sure, and some plot points that should have been dropped into the nearest waste disposal; but much of it is also entertaining and watchable, and this time I thought Cavill was much better.Ben Affleck, too, was surprisingly good. He fit the role of a slightly older Bruce Wayne well, and his Batman was much better than I thought it was going to be. The warehouse scene is arguably the best Batman fight ever. Not happy with Batman branding criminals. He's a vigilante not a torturer...Wonder Woman? Don't know much about the character, probably needed a bit more build up and development; but she was very impressive in the fight scenes.I would have been quite happy to give the film a 7 if it were not for Jesse Eisenberg. C'mon DC fans; you've been decrying Marvel villains for years as generic but admit it - he was one of the worst bad guys ever seen in a superhero movie. Eisenberg was terrible, and his plan was ridiculous. For god sake re-cast the role! However, overall this has somewhat restored my faith in the DC film universe. Haven't seen Suicide Squad yet but I'm certainly prepared to give that a fair crack of the whip. Justice League could be great..."
" First Official Gray Review
",0.0,-0.9748,2017-01-12 00:00:00,3,"WARGING POSSIBLE SPOILERS:OS= Not just another LOVE or HATE kind of movie.Pros= (1= In the beginning when they show what Bruce was doing during the fight between Superman and Zod in the first movie, I really like the look on Bruce's face. You could really not only see but feel the hate the rage Bruce has for Superman at the time. He conveys that so well through his face spectrally his eyes. Well at least for me anyways.(2= Going in I truly thought a full haired Lex would really bothered me, but surprisingly it didn't as I watched the film, due to my own personal viewing experiences with the first 4 Superman films where Lex wears a toupee.(3= When Gal Gadot finally appeared as Wonder Woman that was the movie was at its best for me, because as soon as Wonder Woman showed up she was like unstoppable. If don't watch the movie own the movie for anything else, it has to be her alone. I wouldn't spoil anything for you. But needless to say, if you're a Wander Woman fan you wouldn't be disappointed, trust me. Cons = (1= The opening or the intro is kind of good, I mean it could be worse, there's literally nothing for me to talk about it, save for. The iconic Martha Wayne Neckless breaking and chattering on the ground was poorly done in my book.(2= The car chase scene was so lame and to some extent boring, and the accumulation of that chase scene with Batman and Superman finally meeting with their Super Hero Suits on was so lame and feels so useless. And the dialog is so forgettable, I literally forgot what was said as soon as they cut to the next scene.(3= Although this Lex Luther is good but I still would prefer Michael Rosenbaum Smallville Version Lex Luther better, in fact as watch the film I literally imagined Michael Rosenbaum dilvering some of those Lex Luther lines just for the fun of it. (4= Superman saving Lois VIA flight lame and very cliché, I felt I have seen it countless of times, and if not mistaken they he saved Lois Lane in that same fashion in the Man Of Still Movie. When Superman saved Lois at the end just before the climax battle. And I think they even did it on the show Smallville and Clack/Superman was forbidden to fly for the run of the show. When that happened in BVS I rolled my eyes back and what I thought I can't say on this site, you would have to use your imagination for that. (5= I Felt that there is very little or no growth to the characters in the film.(6= At times during the movie I felt that Lex has to show off his intelligence to show how smart he is, by refencing history and I think religion at times. (7= At times I felt like it was kind of a sleeper of a movie.(8= Lex's manipulation for Superman to fight Batman was really unnecessary, considering they already want to fight each other during the course of the movie. And while we're on the subject I also felt that there is no reason what so ever for Lex wanting Batman dead unless he some how knows Batman is Bruce Wayne and he is plaining some kind of take over or buy out of Wayne Tech or something which I doubt, they gave no indication of that.(9= This next part is a bit of a nip pick on my part, I just wished I know more about the Kryptonite discovery on earth, how was it discovered, who discovered it, when did it land on earth and the like etc. And while we're on the subject during the titled fight unless Batman somehow got his hands on some Blue K Superman shouldn't have lost his powers, if anything he should have been on the ground and in pain. (10= Even with the almost 3hr run time it still feels like a mess of a movie. It's like they are forcing you to buy the Extended Cut just so you could get the full story, in addition. After watching it I literally felt that I just a bunch of clips off of YouTube. So in short it feels DC is playing the evil greed card. In every sense of the word. (11= Doing the Death of Superman Story line was way too soon, and really pointless, I think the whole point of that was to force some tears out of us the audience. But on the bright side I do like Superman's Coffin, it looks right out of the comics and the Superman Doomsday DC Animated Movie. CS= Overall I think it's still worth a own the Extended Cut would be proffered, just for the Wonder Woman Part as I have said in the Pro Section of my Review. And for that alone that was where the majority of my score went."
" Weird woman Bat chump and super dead poor excuse for a movie.
",-0.5994,-0.9862,2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,It literally took three weeks to finish it was so slow and not really a good story. I have seen most batman and super man movies and cartoons and shows and this is just nothing in those great and good shows realm. The acting was poor the story was poor the directing was poor. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sorry maybe someone liked it. I have not talked to anyone that liked it. I went against them trying to have faith bought it and now will be burning that thing. Well it seems I did not write enough let's try this remove the Wonder Woman the Bat chump and the super dead maybe you will have a good day but still not a good movie. I don't normally say things this bad about movies but hey I guess it's going the way of the rest of hollyweird down in the dumps. I remember the good days of good actors and directors full theatrical productions not electro imaginary blue screen. Where are the good old days of good movies and theatrical productions?
" An Insult to Batman Movies
",-0.5106,-0.9294,2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Horrible, just horrible. This movie is just an insult to the quality and uniqueness of Batman. I mean Ben Affleck was already a huge question mark on how the next Batman Movies would be and BAM! A catastrophe. The movie is simply another money seeking good vs good (for some in explainable reason) super hero movie. Nothing more. We don't get to know why we have all those anger and hatred from Batman against Superman. The costume of Batman is another disaster. I mean is that Batman or Iron Man? Can he actually walk in that?"
" Deeply Flawed But Undervalued
",0.0,0.9973,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice was one of my most anticipated movies of all time, the entire three years from when it was announced to its eventual release I had nothing but faith that this film would be excellent. When ever a controversial casting choice was made I was sure that it was the film makers trying to go for something different and while I definitely like this film more than most I was incredibly disappointed. There is still plenty of good in this film though for one Ben Affleck gave an amazing performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman he perfectly sold the characters damaged will and brutality, there was never a moment when he was in screen that I was bored, Afflecks performance is the one thing in this movie that proved everyone wrong and based on this film Affleck could be on his way to becoming the best iteration of the character. Henry Cavill was really good as Superman but the character does have a tendency to A bland and boring at times. Gal Gadot was excellent as Wonder Woman and left a real impression in her limited screen time. Jeremy Irons was brilliant as Alfred he was extremely funny and had excellent chemistry with Bruce. Amy Adams continues to be a bright of these films as Lois Lane. The action sequences in this film are all amazing there brutal and the special effects are pretty much seamless. Ultimately I have to praise this films ambition to tell a complex story of how the world reacts to heroes and all the different perspectives of it. But ultimately that I where this film has its greatest shortcomings, this film simply tries to do to much in to short a time and collapses in on itself. It makes questionable character choices with no real reasoning or motivations particularly Batmans need to kill which in the surface would be an amazing addition to the character but is given no reason behind it so falls flat. I really like Jesse Eisenberg but he easily gives the worst performance of his career in this film but that's ultimately due to the script which turns him into a laughable and cringeworthy character that dragged this film down every time he is on screen. A primary role this film had to fill was setting up this world and the way it was done did the job but was extremely on the nose and felt shoehorned into the plot. I have heard from a lot of hardcore fans of this film that in the future this will become a cult classic while I'm not sure I can bring myself to agree with that nothing would make me happier. It's got an incredible lead Performance from Ben Affleck, it has its entertaining sections and I loved this films ambition but it all ended up collapsing in on itself and created more a very messy and muddled film that could have been so much better. 63%/C+"
" Dull and boring
",-0.6124,-0.6166,2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I enjoyed Man of Steel however felt cautious about this film and rightly so. This film is not compelling in the slightest and any hope I had early on about this film quickly evaporated. It is dull and boring and seemingly takes forever to get going only to disappoint with the titular smack down and then chug along to a laughable climax against the cave troll from lord of the rings. Ben Affleck is great as Bruce but his Batman is way to violent and miles away from the character I've grown to love. Henry Cavill gets nothing to do except brood and make constipated faces and poor Amy Adams is saddled with a subplot that I honestly struggled to care about in an attempt to make her character relevant. Gal Gadot however is great as Wonder Woman but has no reason to be there except to set up Justice League. In fact, that seems to be the only thing the film wants to do which causes the story to suffer. Its a shame as they also wasted Doomsday and the death of Superman which would have been amazing if it was saved for a solo movie."
" Like it was written by checklist
",0.3612,0.7992,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This movie seems to be created by a checklist. It forgets that for a movie to be great it must be more than the sum of its parts. It has big name actors, superheroes, character development, plot development, action sequences, and gritty realism. Despite getting everything on the checklist, it is a plodding, boring movie.I like Jessie Eisenberg but his portrayal of Lex lacked power. Wonder Woman wanders around the movie seemly one step ahead of Batman but without any reason why she seeems to know more than she does.The constant dream sequences from Batman was more tormenting to the audience than to the character. For being an intelligent human, Batman seems to be susceptible to the same propaganda that the rest of the uninformed masses are believing. You would think Batman of all people would realize that the press doesn't always give an accurate representation."
" The World's finest Team
",0.0,-0.9973,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice is to me the best film of 2016. And perhaps like Man of Steel the most misunderstood. The film opens up as the attack on Metropolis is at its worst and Bruce Wayne arrives to see his office tower destroyed and his employees die. and injured. flash forward two years and Bruce Wayne is still as bitter. He's Forgotten what The Batman is supposed to have stood for. He's still doing the job but he's killing and torturing the criminals. And he's worried about Superman. He believes that one day Superman will turn on them and he must have a plan in place. When Superman rescues Lois Lane from a warlord in the Middle East Superman and Lois interfere in a CIA plot and people die. superman is blamed for those deaths. And its added to the destruction of Metropolis there is a senate hearing already in effect on the Superman problem. And there is the little matter of a mad man named Lex Luthor who is stirring the pot creating even greater trouble. Luthor has discovered a mineral that can kill Superman. He names it Kryptonite . The only problem is its rare. Things heat up when the capital building is destroyed and Superman is believed to be involved . Bruce Wayne finds out there are others like Superman and that Luthor has files on them. And when he tries to steal them he meets a Wonder woman named Diana Prince.the movie comes together in a big finale that is action packed energetic and wonderfully filmed. And it sets up The Justice League nicelyThe reason the movie is misunderstood is this. Batman does not kill That is wrong he does and he has killed in the comics The Martha scene. Again pretty much like the Tornado scene in Man of Steel people fail to realize that there is actually something going on inside the character's head .Martha is a word that acts as a trigger and to me that's the most realistic scene in the movie.There are other things but Synder is aiming for a realistic take and he succeeds. People compare this so much to Christopher Reeve and his movies or Adam West / Christian Bale or the comics and fail to see that this movie has nothing at all to do with any of those.This is a stand alone movie not having any ties to the other versions of Superman and Batman it's its own Earth .To me the film works because when you look at it. how else would a Superman or a Batman be precievced by the public except as Gods and Monsters .
" A Solid Entry into the DCEU
",0.1531,0.3856,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"So I've taken some time to let Batman V Superman digest in my mind, and now, I will share my opinion. Batman V Superman, in my opinion, was one of the best, if not THE best, comic book movies this year. Positives: We were given our best Batman EVER, complete with loads of high tech gadgets, amazing fight choreography, an amazing suit, and great lines. We saw our first look at Wonder Woman, who provided a breath of fresh air to normal movie-goers engorged in the fighting. Along with all of this, we got to witness a battle between Batman and Superman, all accompanied by my favorite CBM soundtrack of all time. The UE helped flesh out some narrative issues for me, like the Nairobi crisis, and created character development for important characters, particularly Superman. Negatives: Jesse Eisenberg as Lex stinks. I'm sorry, you can say all you want about how he is psychologically damaged and menacing , but he was no bueno.I'm not saying he wasn't a great actor, because if he was playing someone else or an original villain, than maybe I would've liked him more. Also, Doomsday. Yikes. I feel like they kinda wasted an opportunity here with this, and the whole Death of Superman arc literally lasted 40 minutes. They should've kept it for a separate sequel! Amy Adams as Lois Lane, again, is literally the embodiment of the damsel-in-distress trope. Editing could be a bit shotty, and the JL cameos felt really shoe-horned in.Overall: 7.5/10 +Batfleck/Wondy +Zimmer/Junkie's soundtrack +DAT ACTION +Character Devlopment -Villains -Lois"
