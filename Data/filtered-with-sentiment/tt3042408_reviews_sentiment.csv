" Fun premise spoiled by zero credbility ""hacking""
",0.5106,0.9896,2021-03-14 00:00:00,5,"For a low budget film, the production value is impressive. Unfortunately the script seems like something out of a young, film class screenwriter. They have a story to tell and an interesting stylish way to tell it but they don't bother to make much effort to provide the components that sell credibility.The premise of the story is that a ""super hacker"" is speaking to the head of a criminal agency to discuss his involvement with an incredible series of cyber hacking and espionage events. He becomes friendly with a group of childish acting fanatics who have visions of taking down targets in the hope of impressing a super hacker. Pretty ridiculous but... OK...The good: The actors do an excellent job on trying to sell their parts. The production and camerawork is excellent for low budget. The story does move along pretty well - but it becomes increasingly impossible to suspend disbelief as the film moves on. It's unfortunate that a movie about ""super hackers"" leave the tech part to transparent fantasy. I had a feeling there was trouble when our protagonist could ""read machine code."" What? ""Show me"" he is asked. Type in stuff really quickly, have lots of windows open with scrolling code and then let the magic happen. Sadly, the tech explanations become more ridiculous as things moved along.There are two films that are copied in the script. Unfortunately I saw it coming early. What is funny is that the other movie it copies might have been done so deliberately, as the poster of that movie is on a wall late in the film. The last quarter of the film goes to preposterous."
" Non-Put-Down-Able
",0.0,0.9236,2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, for a film that is in a foreign language, meaning it is heavy in the subtitle department, and very, very wordy - I started watching this at 3 minutes to midnight and was just going to watch maybe ten minutes and then stop - I found that I just could not take my eyes off of the screen. It was so well done. It was also, very exciting and literate and smart. It had all of the attributes of what a classic suspense film should have. That's all I'm going to say. It was fantastic."

" No System is Safe
",0.1779,0.9935,2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"Cybercrime genre is a gray area in movie industry because most of them are operating in dark web. Understanding and executing a cybercrime film, thus, inherets specialised skills on hacking, dark web surfing, internet protocols and security.
With the tagline ""No System is Safe (Kein System ist siche)"", german cybercime thriller Who Am I depicts that, all systems can be broken by any super intelligent personnel. The man-made system is not sustainable at all, because those system has been made by human themselves. Human brain and intelligence can't be fixed in any particular boundary.
The central character Benjamin (Tom Schilling) is a young, introvert computer geek who has enormous skills in computer. He is quite expert in machine language and due to this expertise, he has been picked by a group of hackers. Benjamin discovers the dark but interesting kingdom of hackers named Fr13nd lead by an anonymous hacker MRX. He tries to find out the identity of MRX and strives to become an eminent hacker like him. Intel officer Hanne (Trine Dyrhom) is after this hacker group and gets a lead to find out through Benjamin.
This movie is quite a cat n mouse game between Benjamin and Hanne and it is interesting to watch who is actually win at the end. Storyline was quite predictable for thriller lovers but its interesting and enjoyable to watch such a thriller which enforces the audience to think ahead.
The screenplay, direction were well executed. BGM was very refreshing to hear. Team WHO AM I won 6 national awards in Germany including director Baran."

By faking an injury of Max on Benjamin's hand, he made Hanne believe he has psychological problems and three friends are not dead and only in Benjamin's mind (Story B).
The true intention of Benjamin is to get a completely new identity to get away from MRX with his three friends, who are also in danger (Story C).
It is rather complicated, but Story A and B is planned for story C.
And Story C is achievable because Benjamin just have to fake an injury rather than killed by MRX and Bejamin just have to assume Hanne would notice the inconsistency of story and faked injury and assume Hanne want to protect Benjamin from MRX, which are all somehow reasonable."

" Germany's Mr Robot
",0.0,0.9947,2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"I was watching some Youtube videos to gauge what people thought about the authenticity of the hacking on WarGames (though I probably didn't actually need to do that considering from my perspective it was pretty good) when I came across this film. I noticed that it was in German, which piqued my interest, and then discovered that it was directed by the same director who did Dark. Well, that pretty much sent it straight to the top of the list of films that I was wanting to watch. Actually, the story goes that the guy that runs Netflix watched his film, was so impressed that he approached the director and asked him to do a series on Netflix.Well, it is a little difficult to say what this film is related to. There are elements of Mr Robot, there are elements of The Usual Suspects, and there are elements of Fight Club. Yeah, movies that you probably wouldn't connect with a hacker film (with the exception of Mr Robot), but it certainly does work. Basically our hero, Benjamin, approaches Hanne Linberg, who happens to head up the European Cyber-Security Taskforce (or something like that), and had also been given the task of hunting down his crew. Anyway, the film is mostly him telling Hanne his version of events, which as you can see has elements of Usual Suspects. Basically they are attempting to track down this hacker MRX who apparently leads a terroist organisation called FR13NDS.There are plenty of twists in this film, from when we see Benjamin first get in contact with the group CLAY, and then play numerous pranks around the city before pulling off a daring raid so as to get the attention of MRX. In the end, pretty much everything goes south, which is why Benjamin ended up going and confession to Hanne. Mind you, as is the case with Fight Club, and as with the case with The Usual Suspects, we don't actually know the whole story, and Hanne seems to believe that there isn't so much holes, or that the attacks never happened, but rather Benjamin really doesn't have a true grasp of reality.Well, that is interesting because there doesn't seem to be much mention of the ending, because in my mind it leaves a lot of things up in the air. Did the ending that we witnessed really happen, or was it all just in Ben's imagination. There are a few hints that suggest that it could actually have been all in his imagination. Yeah, the film twists, and then does a double back right at the end, which honestly, made me question whether what we watched was accurate or not.The film does portray the world of hacking quite well, from the idea of Script Kiddies (hackers who just hack by running programs as opposed to actually being proper hackers) to social engineering, the major way that hackers actually get into systems. Yeah, social engineering is a key element, which generally means that the picture of a loner hiding in his basement isn't the true picture of the hacker.Yeah, this film was actually pretty cool. It certainly does take hacker films to a new level, particularly pointing out that they are actually quite sociable, and go to parties and all that. Yet, as I suggested, there are some rather interesting questions that have been raised, particularly at the end. Though, I must admit that the plan that Benjamin executed to actually catch MRX, was pretty cunning in and of itself. Yeah, I've probably given too much away as it it, but it is still quite worth watching."

" ""Audacity will prevail""
",0.0,0.9867,2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"German techno-thriller 'Who Am I' is a slick, engrossing, and devious descent into the world of hacking.Benjamin is a lonely computer expert - an outsider - but someone who yearns to be different. When he meets the charismatic Max, everything changes as he plunges into a world of cybercrime. Now part of a hacker group desperate for recognition from the notorious MRX, what begins as harmless deception soon upscales into cyber warfare.Benjamin is easy to identify with - and I found myself relating to his personality a lot - which makes his journey all the more interesting while being concerned for how he'll cope with mischievous acts that spiral into anarchy. He knows it's wrong, but he does it anyway because he wants to be more. He wants to be noticed. The desire to be someone who isn't a nobody. Relatable.But Max is the opposite. Someone so confident and audacious that you don't know whether to despise or envy him, as he forces Benjamin out of his comfort zone, eager to use this new member's computer wizardry for nefarious purposes.The film speeds along at a gratifying pace; crisply filmed and visually immersive while being backed by the terrific tempo of its techno score as it heads towards a finale which, for a while, seems predictable.Since we start in medias res, some of the suspense generated feels diluted because the destination is known. Then it throws a twist that immediately disappoints: it's been done before and really doesn't work in this instance, making you think the film has settled for an easy out while ruining any subsequent watch.Luckily, 'Who Am I' rebounds with a second twist not long after that not only made me breathe a sigh of relief, but left me satisfied. This is definitely a thriller that excels when it's forcing you to be an unwitting accomplice in the hacking activities while questioning the ethics of its characters.8/10"

" The Great Hacker Film
",0.6249,0.9962,2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"This film tells the story of Benjamin Engel (Tom Schilling) a loser in the real world but an expert in cyberspace, He feels invisible. studying at the age of 14 and a programming language expert. he accidentally meets Max (Elyas M'Barek because he is convicted of being a public servant). Ben is convicted of being caught hacking the campus server. he hacks into the question answer for the person he loves, Marie. at the end of the story, told how he hacks humans.
Max then introduces two of his friends, Stephan and Paul. with a little test for ben, they finally make a group of hackers named CLAY, CLAY (Clown Laughing At You) or ""clowns laugh at you"". CLAY begin trying to hack to try its capabilities, various government systems, financial buildings, offices, companies, etc. are targeted. but that is only an experiment and uploaded on youtube. on Youtube he tries to see his popularity as a hacker group. besides that, Max really admires the MRX, MRX is a hacker from the Fri3nds group which is an expert in hacking anything. But MRX has never responded to what CLAY did to make MAX disappointed. he also wants to try to hack something to attract MRX attention. Finally CLAY decides to try to hack the BND or the German Federal Intelligence Agency. According to information, no hackers can penetrate the security of the system there.
In this film, the plot itself is fairly complex. Although at first it seems normal, but over time, the story becomes more interesting until finally the ending filled with a layered twist that is able to show that this film is indeed classy. Maybe the word ""Extraordinary"" is more appropriate for this plot of Who Am I - No System Is Safe. How not, the film made by Baran Bo Odar (where the previous work The Silence (2010) was also able to captivate me) this successfully make me look so stupid because all my guesses were wrong in guessing the twist. Odar is great at manipulating the text of the story in such a way that we as spectators are forced to guess what happened. However, it was very satisfying to see the final result of this film which made me split open before finally the word 'bravo' came out accidentally from my mouth. So, if you think you have succeeded in guessing the twist in the part towards the end of the story, don't be happy too early, because maybe you will be fooled like me. But if you manage to guess the twist, I pick up two thumbs up for you. I haven't watched a movie for a long time with a satisfying twist like this.
Who Am I - No System Is Safe is more interesting because it is played by the right actors. Through a presentation full of exciting and thrilling action and a high level of curiosity, Who Am I - No System Is Safewant you must try. Moreover, this film was closed with a stunning sweet twist. And you know what, it can be predicted that Hollywood will use this film."

The film is technically competent, the acting is good, the tempo and music will drive you and keep your attention without a problem. The story itself seems to be a classic seven, but multiple plot-twists at the very end have thrilled me. Through film permeate almost unnoticeable homages to a cult 'Fight Club', that will, if you notice them, lead you to assume the outcome of this story. You will guess wrong. Only before the very end I finally understood some seemingly insignificant details and solved the puzzle... again wrong. Now, after the second viewing, I'm not so enthusiastic as I was the first time, which is expected for mindfak based on the unexpected twists and turns, but far from that I was bored and I enjoyed it from start to finish.

",0.3612,0.9955,2017-05-22 00:00:00,9,"This film is interesting because there are reversals in the movie. This movie is about Benjamin and his friends hack the system to be like their role model, MRX, who is the best hacker i the world. But they went to too far and becoming the target. And trying to go back to their normal life.For artistic value is pretty good. The light, color, and the background sound help audience get more concentrate the scene.For literacy value the plot was great. Benjamin explains his story to Hanne who is German FBI officer. But he doesn't explain the story specifically. These foreshadow makes the reversal in the movie. I won't tell this because it could be the spoilers and these parts are the best.For educational value in this movie wasn't that strong meaning but still tell us people usually want to see what they want to see even it won't be true.For entertainment value is pretty good in this movie. At first half hour Benjamin and his friends hack the system but not that big but still makes the movie don't get bored. Overall, I really liked this movie. And I recommend you if you like the movie has big reversal in the movie."
