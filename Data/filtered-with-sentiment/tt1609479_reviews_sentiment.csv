" Watching and fun

" Why the hell is Jane Fonda narrating everything?
",-0.6808,0.4404,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Apart from the tonal dissonance, I'd say this is a relatively enjoyable movie and I would've probably given an extra star if they had ditched the narration."

" 5 stars is meant to be vague, here :-)
",0.2263,0.9883,2018-12-15 00:00:00,5,"I wont be telling you much about the story itself here. I feel it's eventful scenes, based on their ""realism"", will not help you guess how much you'd enjoy seeing it. Almost like animated films about giants killing each other, you needn't judge the characters actions sensitively. You have the option to accept them as if happening in another world. That having been said, my experience was identifying with a character with little solidity, even less identity. Having run into a woman with a similar vagueness about her Self, he grabs on to the emotional clarity they stumble into together. That clarity enables them to finally see how their lives are little more than imitative. Subsequent events are often extremely dramatic, but can be accepted (by viewers like me) as symbols, and not just crimes. Actually Rockwell's character really does try to confess, and pay up for the bad parts of his growth period, but he lucks out with kinds of ""gift"" options, and maybe a fairytale like path after having learned big lessons about how to live better. Wilde's character, as different as she had seemed, has grown in similar ways; and their paths, however individualized, do bless them with a fine appreciation of their friendship. I found it warm, funny, and with possibly empowering motivations for some viewers."
" BACK IN THE NEW YORK GROOVE
",0.0,0.818,2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"In a small idyllic town, the village pharmacist knows everyone's secrets. Doug Varney (Sam Rockwell) has a fitness compulsive wife (Michelle Monaghan) an unruly child (Harrison Holzer) and an irritating narrator (Jane Fonda). Stuck in a rut he meets rich wife Elizabeth (Olivia Wilde) who breaks Doug out and instills confidence in him through an affair and pills.The film reminded me of a generic Magnolia indie. Let's throw together some quirky characters, get a couple of names, create an unlikely scenario, toss in a few cliches, an appropriate sound track and stir. There was nothing overly entertaining in the film, yet at the same time I wasn't bored waiting for something to happen. For those who can't get enough of the clever and quirky indies, you might get a quick fix from this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex."
" Fun
",0.5106,0.9371,2018-05-02 00:00:00,7,Fun if at times frenetic. Rockwell is perfect. I was left a bit uneasy by the ending even though it rounded everything off nicely. This is like an updated '40s romantic thriller with a comedy thrown in.
" High on drugs
",0.0,-0.1111,2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Yeah, this is going to sound strange but this is the type of film you watch more so for the actors than for the actual plot or film. You'll watch this because you know it has Sam Rockwell and this is a comedy and he will be acting like a wild man in it. You'll watch this because you know it has Olivia Wilde in it and you still have a crush on her. No, this is not the funniest thing you're going to watch this year and it has hiccups and isn't perfect but it is fun, especially once it Rockwell's characters starts getting high off his own supply. 7/10 type of deal but I'm rounding up a point just to offset the main score a bit."
" Pill poppers
",0.0,0.9574,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Don't expect too much of this movie and then you will appreciate it more. I mean by that that it's not a comedy where you will not stop laughing but thanks to Sam Rockwell it has his funny moments. He's a pharmacist with a pretty boring life, with a wife he doesn't really love, a stepfather that can't stand him, and he then falls for a rich blond pill popper played by Olivia Wilde that introduces him to all the drugs he actually has been dealing with for years. What follows is a story of pills taken wrongly for many purposes. A lot of sex, cheating and lies are the consequences of his behavior. The movie never slows down and that's only good for a movie like this one. It's an easy movie to watch, nothing to think about. Just relax on a bad weather day and enjoy the movie."
