" Unable to understand the negativity??
",-0.5661,0.8738,2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Expectations of audience - Oscar winning script and storyline. ""Seriously""?? What were you expecting after seeing promos?? If audience was that smart, why watch it at the first place. Ohhh, ""To trash talk""..You watch such movies for thrill and that's it. What are you trying understand or dig? Movie was publicized as action/thriller and that's what it was. I had fun watching it. Seen it before, saw it again. What does it prove? Answer - difference of opinion.Entertained with shooting sequences and satisfied with murder of Greyjoy and the scoundrel bunchüòè"

Instead of the usual Hollywood action films as of late, they managed to not sacrifice quality for wokeness-diversity-oppression-de-jour.This needs to be cancelled immediately."
" Well made but totally shallow
",0.1406,-0.3087,2021-03-19 00:00:00,5,"So I've heard nothing but good stuff about the John Wick movies and I truly respect Keanu Reeves as an actor, so I decided I'd give it a go, expecting at least a decent movie...The action sequences are undoubtedly excellent and so is Keanu Reeves. I really can't say anything bad about the cinematography either. The music fits nicely and there's some humor here and there.Unfortunately, that's pretty much all I can praise, as the rest is an incredibly thin plot, little to no characterization and plenty of illogicalities. Sure, there's a bit of a story in the beginning before the action starts but that's not nearly enough to make this a good movie if you ask me. By the end I didn't even care because there was nothing for me to care about. Most of the characters exist solely for the purpose of being killed off, and the ones that do have some personality just seem totally stereotypical. Despite Keanu Reeves' performance, there is absolutely nothing special or original about the character of John Wick. And don't get me started on the aforementioned illogicalities. I get it, this is an action movie and I guess it doesn't have to make sense all the time. It's just that e. g. a professional killer shooting a bunch of people in an overcrowded nightclub is utter idiocy in my view. Go to hell with common sense, right?Overall, how this was such a critical success is beyond me. 5/10"

Except for the meager t&a once in a while I gotta say that this was one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to see. I love Keanu Reeves and I love action. And I love revenge flicks and I even love killing in fun crazy ways. But the same thing 50 or 60 times just got on my nerves. Btw, I don't like Mustangs that much. I like SS Chevelles maybe. Also I'm not staying till the end so there'll be no spoilers for me. There. I just saved myself 35 minutes of my life that I don't have to regret because I refuse to watch the last 35 minutes of this incredible pile of bat guano. I think the only reason this might have John Wick double-tap 50 or 60 guys by the one hour mark is to make this a FPS game. That's all I can think of."

" Action done in a different way
",0.0,-0.7105,2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"""John Wick"" is, in my humble opinion, one of the - if not the - best action movie of the last 20 years or so. And the reason for that is the way ""John Wick"" and it's sequels portray action sequences.
One of the biggest flaws action movies have these days is the overuse of cutting. Some action movies use 4-5 cuts for a simple action sequence such as someone jumping off a rooftop onto somebody else. The reason of course being the stunt-performers, since the majority of actors don't do their stunts themselves. These quick-cuts are one of the few complaints I have about Marvel movies and superhero movies in general.
""John Wick"" does not have that problem, and the biggest reason for that is Keanu Reeves, who performs every stunt himself. Therefor no stunt-performer has to be hidden and action sequences can be shown a very long time from the same perspective."
" Impossible but fun!
",0.6948,0.9478,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"I must have watched the JW trilogy about 4 times now and recommended it to a whole bunch of friends. But why?It's an action film and people die. That sounds like a lot of 80's action films so far. Except this is done to a high standard and is very classy. There is minimum cheese, and it's about a world that we can't really imagine exists.Yes, it's impossible, both in his actions, success and the world it's in, but that's the whole point of film, right? It's escapism, not a documentary. At least, I hope it's not a documentary, because if it is, I as never going outside again.Give it a try. This is the cleanest of the three as it was only meant to be a single film. But if you want more than guns, keep watching the series..."

" Action film is stylish, entertaining but extremely violent.
",-0.704,-0.6271,2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"If John Wick is the best looking action film in recent memory.it's also bolstered by a phenomenal cast of actors who, be they in parts big or small, manage to craft three-dimensional characters out of stock archetypes.
One of Keanu Reeve's best performances mainly because he barely has any lines but when he does he sure makes them count. The action is superb and never gets dry and every act of violence seems to be justified at a certain manner.
The action is good and very slick. Keanu always at his best when he has zero dialogue and can just do fighting stuff. To call the plot thin would be an understatement. Unfortunately there's only so much Keanu killing people one after another that Can maintain my interest and by the point we're halfway through the killing.
Love the entire series, each chapter of John Wick is a masterpiece to be watched and re watched again and again! Don't miss this.
But Parents need to know that John Wick is a brutally violent, frequently bloody thriller starring Keanu Reeves as an assassin. There's a very high body count: Characters are shot, maimed, stabbed, beaten, threatened, killed with firearms at close range, blown to bits in an explosion, strangled with bare hands, and more. And especially because so much of the violence is depicted in a stylized, semi-glamorized way, it's best reserved for the oldest teens and adults. Interestingly, a streak of humor also runs through it, and fight scenes choreographed so thrillingly that it's almost like watching ballet -- albeit a gunshot-riddled, rough-and-tumble one.Concluding , It's very interesting movie in my mind i just give it 10/10"

Keanu Reeve stars as John Wick, the expert former assassin, and his friend Marcus (Willem Dafoe). The story about John's revenge from an old friend stole the last hope in life he had.The film is about John Wick recreceives a gift from her a precious keepsake to help John find a new meaning in life now that she is gone. But when his friend's son steals his gift, John determines to kill him and take his revenge in life. So John gets back to his job (assassin). And the journey begins.I was surprised by how amazing the film is. It actually made me stand at the edge of the chair. Keanu Reeve was literally talented all the action scenes were done perfectly. The soundtrack is really matched with the scenes. Overall if you like action films you will definitely love it."

",-0.9056,-0.7757,2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,"Within the first minutes of the movie, a small adorable precious puppy is viciously beat to death for absolutely not reason. despite the short span of time for which the dog appears on screen, it is more than enough to form a strong bond with the animal, falling in love with its cute little face and adorable lopsided smile, it's sweet bark and compelling personality. watching the innocent puppy be brutally beat to death on screen is quite triggering, especially for impressionable audiences. furthermore, the entire movie pretty much consists of middle aged men entirely devoid of any personality or likable traits beating up one another and cursing profusely in Russian. would've been a far better cinematic work if they at least kept the dog around. only way this movie would've been any good. but no, they brutally murder it before the movie even behind. absolutely will never watch again."

Except the antagonists. He cannot kill them with bullets, he becomes a stormstrooper when shooting at them.He kills EVERYONE except one other character, who he decides to leave alive to others kill, for no reason.That's it. Someone kills his dog, he kills thousands of brainless dudes with good shots.That's not even a plot. I bet the writters written the script in a napkin talking in a bar.

I'm aware this is an action movie, but at times the even the scenes felt a bit bland and generic.I've heard John Wick has become an instant cult-classic, and it was actually recommended to me by my mother. We get to meet some interesting characters, but maybe it was a bit overhyped. I feel wickrolled."
" The constant theme of revenge but set against the backdrop of gorgeous action scenes is not boring for even a second.
",0.7746,-0.9162,2021-01-29 00:00:00,7,"An retired legendary hit-man abandons his old life and lives with his wife.
One day when his wife says goodbye prematurely, the puppy that his wife gave to the lone John is a great relief.
But when the son and team of the Russian underworld hero in the city broke into John's house, killed the dog, snatched John and his vehicle, they did not think they were digging their own grave.
If you decide to cast someone to kill the devil it will be John Week The above is enough to fully understand the protagonist.
The constant theme of revenge but set against the backdrop of gorgeous action scenes is not boring for even a second.
The highlight of the movie is the action is beautifully choreographed, the setup is surprisingly emotional for an action and the performance of actor Keanu Reeves.
It's hard to find anything bad to say about John Wick."

" Solid, Solid, Movie.
",0.296,0.7236,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I appreciate that they took their time in the opening act. While I generally don't think Keanu Reeves is that great an actor, he's used effectively here as a stoic and broken man in the beginning.Great choreography and grounded set-pieces throughout the entire movie. They pull the camera back and just let Keanu blast fools apart as cleanly as possible. My only nitpick is that John Wick judo throws people way too much. I dunno, I know nothing about real gunfights but I feel like you can't spend too much time tumbling goons to the floor.Also, I thought the ending sequence was fine but not up to par to a lot of the other parts. Also also, they got Willem Dafoe and I kinda wish he did more stuff. It's the freaking Green Goblin bro, come on."

",0.1027,-0.9253,2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"It delivers intense, kinetic, expertly filmed gunplay with an ice-cold performance from Keanu Reeves - who does virtually all his own stunts - but also manages to carve out much more from its simple premise, transcending its revenge formula with a sprinkle of world building when the bullets aren't tearing through bodies and environments.The soundtrack only adds to the intensity of the shootouts, with a standout sequence being set in a nightclub: a dizzying, exciting whirlwind of carnage against a backdrop of blue strobe lighting and set to the pulse of hardcore electronic music. Stunning.Ultimately, I could watch Keanu Reeves kill bad guys all day.9/10"
" the one you send to kill the boogeyman.
",-0.6908,0.9751,2021-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Reeves is back, and in his best movie yet! I am a big fan of the john wick movies because of their high kill counts and non-stop action. The plot is pretty simple but the action and Keanu Reeves performance more than make up for it. The movie also has more of a realistic tone unlike some of Keanu's other films because it avoids overused tropes like never having to reload guns and the hero never getting hurt. "" John Wick earns it spot on the best action movies of all time and I highly recommend it for action movie fans."
" Fast-paced and entertaining
",0.4404,0.9924,2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Sometimes, I watch a movie because I want to think about it. Other times, I just want to shut my brain off and enjoy some cool action sequences. John Wick is an ideal movie for both. Starring Keanu Reeves in the titular role, the film is packed with unique characters, riveting storyline, beautifully choreographed fight scenes, and an intriguing world brought to life by directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch.
The movie follows former hit man John Wick as he leaves retirement after the murder of his dog. Wick must return to the world he left behind in order to track down the man responsible and get his revenge.
I loved the performances given in this film. While some of the dialogue can come off as stiff, they still make it work. Reeves' acting without words gives incredible depth to his character. The antagonists of the film, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his son, Iosef (Alfie Allen), have fantastic emotional depth and well-developed dynamic. Stahelski and Leitch's directing serves to bring out the best of each actor.
The music in the score all fits perfectly into the film's atmosphere and the lighting creates a strong sense of place in every scene. Characterization through costuming was spot-on and the pacing of the film was fantastic. There was never a dull moment.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good action movie. If you don't have a problem with a whole lot of violence, definitely check this out if you haven't already."
" John Wick
",0.0,0.9977,2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"John Wick, directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who are former stuntmen; was a substantial amount of fun, with a lot of heart and thrills. Stahelski, Leitch & Kolstad not only made a very appealing action flick, but a great emotional story, that packs a big punch, that makes you truly care for Keanu Reeves' character.Keanu Reeves shines bright in this film, not only because he is the lead, or because of his stellar acting, but the fact he takes part in almost all of his action scenes! He steals every single scene he's in, and you can tell he had a blast doing it. As for the rest of the main supportive cast in Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe & Alfie Allen go, there prodigious acting went a long way, considering there come abouts was pretty random, and out of the wood works. I did appreciate the new story they bring along to flesh out everyone's character.The screenplay by Derek Kolstad was deep and intriguing, and essentially the leading hand behind everything. The dialogue he brings to the table is profoundly enjoyable.The action was shot, and executed super well! The hand to hand combat was unique and flowy, while the gun fights were so precise and energetic. The only real issue I had with the action, it seemed to be just a touch over done with plot armor, so it took away from the dramatic effect a little bit. Stahelski & Leitch did a good job of showing vulnerabilities throughout the action, to show that Reeves is just a man like everyone else, so it definitely helps the plot armor.The cinematography by Johnathan Sela is dull and quiet for the most part, but it works so well with the tone and mood. I wish the effects were done a little better, but that is just a little nitpick because it was tolerable nonetheless.Overall, this film is a ton of fun, backed up with some great action, and solid acting all around."

Each and every bad guy, looking super sophisticated, forgets that he is holding a gun and not a piece of metal to come so close to the hero before pulling the trigger.
The friend of hero, reaches the rooftop of the building opposite to the room of the hero, points the sniper and waits. He shoots inches beside the hero to only alert him off approaching enemy. He could have called him up or shot the enemy if he is so concerned. But no, it's an action movie and it is not supposed to be logical, right?
The villian gives up the EXACT address where his son is hiding and patiently waits, having few drinks at his home, till the hero reaches there and kills his son. He then becomes angry, captures the hero, and leaves him with couple of idiots who tries killing him with a plastic bag. Seriously?
Each and every scene seems to to desperately made to look nonsensical.
Such scenes, which the movie is full of, spoils the pleasure of the action scenes and the curiosity that is initially created.
I'm so much confused how such good a rating it is attracting."
