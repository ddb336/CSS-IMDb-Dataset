",0.0,0.9362,2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, I am not a fan of Schumer but the supporting cast, cameos and Judd Apatow's typical treatment of a RomCom makes this a reasonable outing and worthwhile.Bill Hader was underrated as usual and Tilda Swinton played an atypical role for her which I found amusing due to this fact. Although I enjoyed this film despite being a little cliche, but I don't think I will ever make an effort to see ""I Feel Pretty""."

Sadly, I was quite disappointed by this film, especially given its very high rotten tomatoes rating. Sorry to say, I didn't find it funny and stopped watching the movie halfway through."
" Absolutely hilarious

I laughed out loud so many times and the two leads seemed to have real chemistry... LeBron as the cheapskate agony aunt multi-millionaire was hilarious... If you don't laugh at this film then you really can't have any kind of a sense of humour..."
" Very funny
",0.4927,0.8999,2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Given that most positively reviewed movies suck these days and most negatively rated ones are actually good, I am happy to report this movie did not suck and actually was laugh out loud funny through many parts. Delivers."

I dont understand how the trailer said this was the ""#1 comedy in america"", i think i laughed only at the lebron james
scenes but thats only cuz hes a horrible actor and his voice made him sound like the perfect sissy he really is, this
movie is way to long for its material and some scenes were pulled straight from typical cheesy chick flicks which amy
obviously cant pull off. This movie was only funny to its own creators now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Universal 4k ultra hd release may 2021"

It's worth a watch. It's not Oscar but it's hysterical-a breath of fresh air. Amy, if you're reading this...message me! The scene with the dad (you know) is so vulnerable."

",0.0,-0.6195,2020-10-12 00:00:00,1,"You know, it really figures that ""Trainwreck's"" screenplay was written by z-grade actress/comedienne, Amy Schumer (who, as expected, also played the female lead in this dumber-than-dumb mess of pure nonsense).I really couldn't stand the way that Schumer seemed to want her character to be perceived as being adorably cute and outrageously shocking both in the same moment. Yeah. I really got totally sick of that phony baloney rubbish in no time flat.Anyway - With that all said - I seriously think that the only way for anyone to watch ""Trainwreck"" is to view it in super-duper ""fast-forward"" mode. And, then, just forget about it."

I watched 20 minutes of train wrecked and wanted to poke my eyes and ears out!How the hell is this woman getting any work! She is not funny! Maybe she has a lot of relatives and they are keeping her relevant by seeing her movies etc."

" It's not that bad but its not that great either....
",-0.5448,0.9879,2020-09-23 00:00:00,4,"Train wreck is a pretty well written piece for a first time movie and hats off to Amy for getting it done.The presentation is passable and the jokes are not so predictable that you want to walk out nor are they corny like a light hearted romantic comedy. which is probably why people are polarized. It tries to make a statement but it never seems to present a discernable plot.I thought it was better than I expected it to be for a first time release and for that bravo! Is it a good movie? I judge on 2 things:
Would I see the movie again? No, not intentionally but if my wife wanted to see it, I could sit next to her and surf on my phone.Would I recommend it? Not on a list I would recommend but Perhaps if you are a Schumer fan and tolerate early works I would be honest and say its not as bad as you have heard.So for me movies are all about expectations. I was an early Amy Schumer fan but as she progressed her humor didn't and now. not so much. I expected less and got a little more but not enough to try again."
" The Name Fits its Movie
",0.0,-0.6486,2020-09-10 00:00:00,2,"The film is overlong, feels like it's crawling by on several occasions, and is overall a pretty bad film. The cast is charming, in other movies. Schumer is obnoxiously overbearing, John Cena underused, LeBron- well he's the best part of the movie. It's a constant barrage of unfunny bits with no character, an uninspired score and an is an offensively bad film. If The Last Airbender weren't a movie, this'd be my personal number one worst film ever."
" Brilliantly Funny
",0.7845,-0.7107,2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I thought this was one of the funniest movies to come out in a long time. All of the ""not funny"" reviews, IMO, are by people that either a) hate Amy Schumer, or b) hate the role-reversal concept of this movie where the lead is a messed up woman jumping from relationship to relationship instead of it being a man.
Amy, Bill Hader, and especially John Cena are genuinely exceptional. Cena steals every scene he's in. This is a rom-com that has deep well-developed characters with strong emotional arcs. Highly recommended."
" Same Plot As Most Other Movies
",0.0,0.755,2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,"""Worth your time, even though it's 2 hours movie it's really enjoyable movie, but nothing special in this movie the plot is the same as most other movies, Amy Schumer in debut writer she was incridible, and Bill Hader he always gave his best performance"""
" Amy Schumer is disgusting
",-0.5267,-0.8837,2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,"This movie was unapologetically written by Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer is not funny, and it really shows in this film. I really don't understand how this woman shot to fame with lame jokes that would have gotten any male comedian booed off of stage oh, but it's okay for Amy Schumer to do it because she's a woman.This movie shows did Amy Schumer is a player, disgusting and that Bill Hader character is a complete and total wimp who would rather be enslaved to somebody rather than in a relationship with him. It's more like indentured servitude than it is a relationship, except there's no way to get out of this indentured servitude. Judd Apatow lost it years ago, and this movie blows."

There was another scene of a man putting his penis in her vagina with dirty talk... Some other sexual stuff as well. This movie was mainly about a sexy/promiscuous woman who hooks up with guys all over the place. Her dad drilled into her head that Monogamy isn't realistic. Frequent use of words including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" ""c--kblocker,"" and more. Overall... Although this movie was inappropriate... It was still comedy which I like.

It was just annoying and worst think not entertaining at all. Watch the first 15mins and you will get the gist of what a terrible movie looks like."
" Starts badly
",-0.4767,0.5869,2020-03-23 00:00:00,4,"The first act is generic and unfunny. I'm so promiscuous! I'm so high! I eat! I'm so drunk! I felt awkward watching it without so much as an exhale of recognition at some attempt at humour.It picks up once the main guy enters; and he carries it to mediocrity. Still no laughs, but a heartwarming ending."
" Anticipated the disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.9128,2020-03-18 00:00:00,3,"This movie is horrendous. End of story. There was no apparent plot and all the story had were awkward jokes and obscene content in attempts to live up to the ""comedy"" portion of the movie.I personally am not familiar with Schumer's work outside of the movie industry, but her performance was simply not funny. Of course it might have been because of the flaws of her character, but her emotionless acting lifeless delivery esaily validates the raging criticism.The story could have been so easily, turned into a ficticious example of women empowerment, hence great philosophy to back up the movie, but they completely blew it. The cheerleading scene at the end is nowhere near sufficient the redemption Schumer's character. She is still a messed up woman who is constantly drunk, high and possibly unfaithful. The end serves no purpose rather than adding one last pull closer towards ""comedy"".It is an aching waste of Hader's talent, and this movie is evidently a massive failure. Personally I only watched the movie because I am a fan of Lebron James, and somehow I found myself regretting the time I wasted on this movie. One point for Hader, one point for James, and one point for Albert, for that they actually made me laugh.Could have been better, Couldn't have been worse."

" Unrealistic, toxic, and boring storyline
",-0.3182,0.9696,2020-02-25 00:00:00,2,"There's very little depth (or humour) to this film unfortunately. Having seen a Netflix standup special from Amy I was very excited going into it. But I really struggled to keep my eyes open. Most of the jokes were just so bait and cringe. there were one or two that actually gave me a good chuckle but overall the comedy (and love story) was disappointing.I also reallyyy take offence to the movies only consistent message which was that the guy shouldn't give up on this girl who was clearly a total dysfunctional wreck and shared ZERO of his values and interests, like why? I'd of rather it ended with them both being single and seeking therapy because literally why suffer."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9729,2020-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Heaven help me, between this and I Feel Pretty, I think I kind of like Amy as a chick flick actress. To be clear, I am not a fan of her in general. Yes, there is some gross humour in here, which is another thing I'm not keen on, but as with I Feel Pretty, this runs a little deeper and there is time spent giving her character background and family interactions. It made her behaviour understandable, if not great. Plus Judd Apatow does have a real talent for these type of movies (I don't love all of his either, but he certainly has some classics). Classic could be a step too far, but I found this a nice movie, despite some icky behaviour. Some funny and touching parts. I will definitely watch this again sometime."
" This is a very funny movie haha

The characters are flat and uninteresting. Bill Hader and LeBron James were good together, surprisingly. The random cameos from SNL-ers and athletes were really annoying. I like Bill Hader a lot, but he and Amy have no chemistry. Don't bother watching this movie unless (for some reason) you're a fan of Amy Schumer. And even then it's a waste of time."
" Was a little disappointed
",-0.4228,0.7962,2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,Was a little disappointed in this movie. It is pretty much Amy Schumer being herself. When she is herself she is funny so the movie had a lot of laughs but just lacked a good story that I would have expected from Apatow.
" Scared? Yeah! Scared!
",-0.6351,0.8151,2020-01-22 00:00:00,7,"The men are scared that the women would be like that, then bad rating... shame on you... try to understand instead of criticizing and judging.
This movie is good and shows up another side of the moon. Yes poor guys, sometimes the women should be like that... many men are, why women not... treating men like some stupid men do with their women.If you're an open minded person, this movie is for you then... if you're not, you could learn something, but I've my doubts about.
I love Tilda Swinton... 8 stars for her.

" It has its moments
",0.0,0.9537,2019-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Amy Townsend drinks too much, parties too much and sleeps with too many men. Her life can't go on like this. Her boss tells her to write an article of a sports doctor named Aaron Conners. They end up in the same bed, and she even sleeps over at his place, which has never happened before. Could she finally settle down with this man? Trainwreck (2015) is a romantic comedy directed by Judd Apatow. Amy Schumer is a comedienne known from her raunchy style. She did not only play the lead in this movie, she also wrote it. Luckily it's not all about raunchiness, there are also some sweet and touching moments. The chemistry between her and Bill Hader works. Other actors also work for their money. Brie Larson plays the sister Kim. Colin Quinn is the father Gordon. John Cena is a boyfriend Steven. Tilda Swinton is the boss Dianna. The basketball great LeBron James plays himself. The rapper Method Man is Temembe. And then we have Norman Lloyd playing Norman. Today this actor turns 105! That's pretty unbelievable. This is his last movie to date, and he is quite a scene stealer as the old folks home resident. Then you also have talents like Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei and Matthew Broderick in the movie. I must admit I'm not too crazy about movies like this, but I had rather positive feelings after I finished it. I know Trainwreck isn't a movie for everybody, but it does have its moments."

" Trainwreck
",0.0,-0.9854,2019-06-14 00:00:00,1,"A nervous dose of pre-2016 anxiety and late stage capitalist critique. Its key to its thinking is John Cena and Lebron James. What does it say bringing in these heroes of masculinity to mock society's priorities than by making them neurotic, thereby subverting our power fantasies? Not only is nothing real in this strange body snatchers world, but in its unreality we punish ourselves for our illusion narrative through self-flagellation and shame. See how they are confronted in the theater for disturbing the illusion of cinema. As in They Live, being protected in the illusion, in the cruel dilemma of modern exploitation by broader steering media forces. Except Cena has no cogent argument but pure random non-sequiturs like an A.I. love-bot malfunctioning. Whether the film celebrates or crushes Amy's hedonism misses the point, as she arrived at that point before the film begun, therefore the fallout is no consequence in her journey. See the film's gross dishonesty in her friendship with the homeless guy. Class is not treated as a thing, and it goes both ways, hanging out with millionaires, powerful bodybuilders out of her league, the homeless, all is one. Bigger symbol is the center hub of the magazine as a raw cultural mechanism in power. See how Ezra Miller is brought out as somehow being the magazine's very own creation. Note how they show his mother, not father, as the corporation itself takes place of the father... most twisted is its 21st century nihilism is so great they take on their prodigal son romantically. Then his response is to mock her for being childless. As in, despite the ubiquity of the illusion, the lie is still foregone and obvious. The film's true horror is the horror of the modern day--everyone sees the lie, then no one is responsible, therefore all of society is just a race to exploit it. ""You're still grieving? That was eight days ago."" It would be a mistake to see humanity as the enemy, rather its complete irrelevance within this crazy game. See how Amy has no interest whatsoever in sports, ""It's regressive and base,"" therefore in her ignorance is best suited to serve it. ""You are my strongest writer--(she quickly corrected into)--my most 'valuable' writer."" AKA you're reflecting the consumption machine. ""Therefore, you're fired."" In being valuable you no longer represents our readership, meaning, our readership has no individual value and so, deserves no value. (Here the exceptional are emasculated, objectified, and mocked, remember this film is post-individual.) This is a different sort of feminism to the 80s s where it was subversion through upstaging and innovating. Here, Amy very much is smarter than the rest, a frightening thought, except in a post-intelligence world has hopelessly succumbed to it; so losing her job is as meaningless as having it in the first place. Although Schumer's subversion and postmodern fever dream is inherent and overflowing, Apatow with his trademark centrist traditionalist cinema valuing friendship and family and happy endings is completely hopeless to balance it, try as it might. In a way he found the ultimate off-the-rails collaborator and the tension between the two is an oil in water: the destructive psychology of comedians and how they remark, subvert, and upend but can never hope to integrate. The title admits everything. (My favorite was the film stops in the middle for a nostalgic homage to Woody Allen's Manhattan; what does that say about this era when Allen's ironic subversion in sentimentalism somehow aged into peak works of nostalgic romantic sincerity?)"

",0.0,0.988,2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Trainwreck is an amazing comedy film for lots of movie buffs and movie goers to go see. I love these kinds of movies. Amy Schumer and Bill Harder are really talented. Not only does it have great laughs, but it has an in depth storyline about finding the one you want to be with for the rest of your laugh. This film is one that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel would've probably given a thumbs down to. But it doesn't matter, because at the end of the day it is us who have the ultimate say, not the newspaper critics that claim to be. All in all this film has really talented actors and is one that will keep you laughing and wanting another movie by Amy Schumer. You won't want to turn it off until the end credits roll. Also John Cena is hallarious as well.

Which in hindsight is the only direction it could have respectfully taken, but it still lost me. So I'm going to review this in two parts;The first hour was very funny, very vulgar, and overall an enjoyable comedyThe second part was overly long and lost all sense of humour for the most part, the few jokes and gags they did try to put in fell flat for me.Overall this movie could have been a half hour shorter just to cut out the boring melodrama."

Amy Schumer isn't funny; in fact she's infuriating. The water thin script, which is also completely unfunny, comes across as adlibed for 99% of the movie. I could go on...
The one redeeming quality would have been that it would have finally ended, but like me, I'm sure most would be pressing stop well before that point.
Absolute garbage."
" confusing and not worth it
",-0.3749,0.6486,2019-03-23 00:00:00,3,"It felt as if the movie lacked a lot of sentiment and meaning. The romantic spark between the characters wasn't there, and I felt as if there was no change with Amy Schumer's character as the movie progressed. It lacked emphasis and could have been better without the unnecessary ""a-list"" cast and with a different leading actress."
" All men should watch this
",0.0,0.9611,2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,My wife suggested we watch this. I reluctantly agreed and I spent the majority of this film rolling my eyes but stuck with it for the sake of my better half. Maybe I'm a bit thick but eventually I came to understand this story from a female perspective and.... boom!! Love it!! Turns the typical male perspective of women on its head. The ending is triumphant in a real world way. Would recommend men watch this film to understand something of the female phyche when relating to (hopefully not) most men.

The film featured a big cast of different actors and actresses including Amy Schumer, Brie Larson, Bill Hader, LeBron James, John Cena, Matthew Broderick etc. When I started watching I was worried that I won't see much of John Cena in the film. I did see quite a bit of him in the film and his acting as Steven was absolutely brilliant. The only thing about this film that needed change was that they should have used John Cena in this film a bit more, maybe in other scenes after his split from sexy girlfriend Amy played by Amy Schumer. The film wasn't absolutely hilarious but it was quite funny and had some funny scenes such as the one where John Cenas character Steven got in an argument with a black in the cinema when he was watching a film with girlfriend Amy and said some funny things to the black guy. The film wasn't an excellent film but it was a very good one which was entertaining."

" The irony of the title being trainwreck!
",-0.126,0.9223,2018-10-20 00:00:00,2,"It might be that I just don't enjoy Amy Schumer. It might be that, or it might be just that she's annoying. I think she does it on purpose. The ""point"" of the movie is showing a woman ""living the way she wants, being the way she wants without apologizing"", and while I love the message, the way of selling I didn't.Great! Woman should be free of any restraints that men do not have, so I'm not opposed to do that. But being disgusting in every possible way is not a succesful strategy for men, but here she's fine. She has a job, she has sex with all kinds of men. She has a friend. I just ask ""HOW?"". It makes no sense. Maybe the character is being funny where I just see her being rude. Maybe she's being cute while I see ""annoying"". Maybe is ""awkward honestly"" when I see incompetence.In the end, for a romantic comedy, the movie is not funny except when Schumer is not around (in particular the LeBron's scenes), is not romantic (the ""love"" is totally forced as Bill Hader's character has no reason to fall for her), is not realistic (she shouldn't have a job, being the parasite that her character really is) nor is ridiculous enough to be funny that way (everything that happens is plausible, only not expertly done).I wanted to give this movie points for having LeBron, Bill Hader and Tilda Swinton. But only a handfull of their scenes are not infected by the sins of awful humor that destroy this movie."

" Trainwreck wasn't a complete crash, but did derail from its comedic tracks.
",0.3354,0.9863,2018-09-29 00:00:00,5,"Look, I like comedies. Laughing, smiling or even rolling on the floor in stitches. It's a beautifully contagious emotion, allowing you to forget about your woes. So, once again, another modern comedy failed to hit the mark. I'm getting sick and tired of subjecting myself to critically praised comedies, only for the end result to be ""meh"". Just give me something legitimately funny! A magazine writer, who enjoys sleeping around without consequence, starts interviewing a doctor who quickly falls in love with her. Predictably, we witness her come to terms with the dreaded word that revolves around relationships. ""Commitment"". Say it with me now. ""Com-mit-ment"". Now, there were a few aspects I appreciated. The chemistry between Schumer and Hader felt natural, exhuming a sense of realism. The minimal use of typical Hollywood romantic clichés (aside from the face-palming ending) felt refreshing and certainly made the story and its characters relatable. Surprisingly, John Cena and LeBron James provided the most humour. But when the sporting superstars are far funnier than the usual SNL actors, you know something went wrong. Honestly, Schumer isn't funny. She isn't! Objectively and subjectively. Hardly a ""tour-de-force"" performance, however some of the emotionally charged scenes were conveyed adequately. The character she portrays is mostly uninteresting, and unfortunately is the primary focus of the story. It's Hader's character that garners the most interest, but is rarely explored with a lack of backstory. Larson and Swinton were underused. And, I've saved the best criticism til last, they spoilt the ending to 'The Usual Suspects'. Really? You honestly thought ruining the ending to a classic, to which many still probably haven't seen it, would generate laughs? Uncalled for. So besides that sickening crime against humanity, the lack of humour, boring characters and horrific ending...it's alright. It's fine. Watchable atleast. But darn it, I'm done with modern comedies. They just further illustrate how cold I am."

If you have seen her just a few times, the sexual humor and jokes will seem stale. I laughed really hard the first time I heard them. Messed up by her absentee father as a child, Amy has trouble with long term relationships (as measured with a watch and not a calender) which leads to many sexual role reversal scenes that seem artificial especially the one with LeBron James, who like Amy played himself. As a writer, Amy meets Dr. Aaron Connors (Bill Hader with nerd glasses), the premier sports doctor and a man who is basically too good for her. There are things going on with her sister, father etc.I did enjoy the Marv Albert scene. Tilda Swinton was great. I am not partial to successful director/producer Judd Apatow as is the general population. I thought his influence turned what could have been a classic into one we will forget...""No not 'Bridesmaid', that other one...you know, the one with the chunky blonde in it."" I am just kidding Amy, I think you're great and I know the Hebrew alphabet. ;) The film had some really good scenes and a few that didn't work.

" Has its moments
",0.0,0.99,2018-05-31 00:00:00,6,"Trainwreck was a massive success when released and mainly due to the direction and name plate of Judd Apatow. Amy Schumer's writing as her characters fits in well, but the sell was ""a film by Judd Apatow"", as well it should be, considering this was Amy Schumer's coming out. Looking back, she had a lot of promise, but now fast forward three years later, she has starred in a series of flops and her career as a leading woman doesn't look well. Trainwreck is quite decent and funny at certain parts. The beginning is quite interesting, the middle is decent and becomes interesting more so then the ending or last part of the film is quite predictable as most romantic comedies. Amy Schumer's character becomes more annoying and crude as the film passes, as it becomes quite less funny. The short supporting roles played by John Cena in the first half is quite good, as well as the more so longer cameo by LeBron James throughout is quite funny. A lot of the film is either hit or miss and has divided fans alike. Trainwreck feels like a film where people either love it for its crude nature, or they hate it for its dirty jokes and such."

A constant need to have minor cameo characters get funny improv bits in, pointless celebrity cameos that needlessly fill up time, and scene after scene that could have been either completely cut, or drastically re-worked to make the movie flow better. Just about the only thing that this movie has going for it is the gender swapping of tropes, other than that, it's just bad. Sure there's a couple of laughs, but Apatow NEEDS someone to tell him when to cut, that not everything he touches is gold, and a tight script is worth a million improv jerk offs."

Later it turned out a lot of her stuff was apparently lifted which makes it even more strange that it was not funny at all.Anyway I went into this movie expecting it to be not very good, and even then I was disappointed. Bill Hader was good and a lot of the other bit players were too but Amy Schumer was terrible and a few of the supporting characters were bad too. Judd Apatow can usually do no wrong for me, either great stuff or at least watchable and enjoyable, but this movie is just awful. Terrible movie, terrible script.It's not that the movie is dirty or anything, I am 100% fine with that.

The 1970s film ""They shoot horses don't they"" is perhaps the most boring film ever made, ""Train Wreck"" fills the slot as the second most boring film ever made. Its impossible to spoil the plot, because a plot does not exist. It's simply an assembly of disconnected scenes, of Ms. Schumer streaming expletives.

When she is forced to write an article about sports, a field she is anything but firm in, she falls in love with a doctor that turns her life upside down.The film mainly works with easy humor, although I have to say that the producers mastered the art of creating funny moments through different speed. I find it quite worrying that the movie plays a lot with stereotypes and in parts racial humor, because even though they are attached to characters that are considered negative, they are meant to create laughter and thus get confirmed. The plot itself is a very basic story of a romantic comedy, two very different lovers who rush into each other's life and form a deep relationship. This is spiced up by a lot of celebrities guest-starring that differentiates it from similar films of the genre.All in all this is a basic romantic comedy, with questionable but clever humor and a set of well-known actors and celebrities. Not for everyone surely and with some difficult jokes but surely carefully produced."

Netflix never fails to disappoint. I admit I only tried this out to see if it was as bad as I thought. It is pretty much what I thought, but, even more disgusting. I'm not saying women cannot be funny, but, this one certainly isn't. I really hate her persona and it should not be emulated in any way. Men are not looking for women who behave like this.

This is garbage men pure garbage stinker film! It has the worst actress in this movie! It is not entertaining it is not a comedy it is some weird drama! In my opinion Amy Schumer is the worst actress on the whole planet she is absolutely horrible and she stinks. She looks all washed up. I couldn't finish this movie because it is so terrible to watch. It feels like someone punched me in the face. The plot is confusing and really bad with clichés all around.OK John Cena is in this movie and he is horrible, he's acting is terrible and I was never a fan of him since he made The Marine. Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin is better WCW wrestler and better actor to me. John Cena can not act. The script , the dialogues are terrible. Amy's character is not likable but she is an asshole bitch. She treats men like sh** she is awful. Amy's sister Kim (Brie Larson) doesn't give a damn about their father Gordon (Colin Quinn). I also did not like that Amy was cheating and switching their boyfriends like t-shirts. I did not liked the Mark Whalberg joke from John Cena at all in the movie theater.I don't like this film, the director was awful, the script was lazy and confusing. The writer Amy Schumer made an horrible job with the confusing script. I did not like Amy Schumer calling a sport stupid and dumb at all! This movie is sad and no one is likable in this movie! I still can't believe that some people are buying this crap and give it higher rating.I am sorry folks for this review but this movie is overrated and horrible. I have seen better comedy's than this. How about 13 Going on 30 (2004) with Jennifer Garner better actress and better movie. How about Walk of Shame (2014) with Elizabeth Banks I like Elizabeth better than fat Amy Schumer and I also liked that movie and I thought was better than this. Another thing those two young girls who played Amy and Kim (Devin Fabry and Carla Oudin) were only in the opening scene in a cameo role and that was an horrible scene and that was it, that was there story no explanation what happened with their mom, nothing. And again this movie is not funny is 2hrs way too long! Why should I care about this damn movie if the actress does not care about the audience. I watched last night Fist Fight and it was also horrible but at least it was entertaining and I had a few loughs this movie has nothing guys! How can you say it is good? I don't understand.Amy Schumer please retire from movies you suck and you are horrible awful at acting and your character is dumb and stupid not likable. Oh end the boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) is a horrible person and Amy Schumacher since you hate so much sports kiss my ass! Score is F 1/10 Avoid like a plague!"

She's assigned to do a story on successful sports doctor Bill Hader, and they essentially fall in love although all of Amy's instincts send her running from commitment. On the face of it, a fairly routine romantic comedy scenario with the typical gender roles reversed.

After all, it's supposed to be all about YOUR opinion. That said, one still must consider the possibility to review a movie regardless of whether one cares for the actors involved. A LOT of people simply don't like Amy Schumer. There are mostly two camps: those that love her, and those that despise her. Sure, there's a smattering of folks in between leaning toward both poles, mostly though, she brings out strong feelings in people.I've yet to really put my finger on exactly why. Sure, she seems racist to some, vulgar, trashy, I've even heard her described as disgusting. She's also talented and fearless. She wrote this screenplay. First time out, and I feel she did a great job. It's well balanced, funny, and has a bit of heart. That was mostly from the mind of Ms. Schumer. Ancillary characters are very well placed and a fine casting job was done. The directing was solid. cinematography was very well done. So what is it? Many give it a 10, and many give it a 1. I believe it was better than average, and that's because I'm focused on the film as a whole. All aspects of it. Bill Hader did a great job. LeBron James was refreshingly natural for a sports star. They're usually quite wooden. Very good cast doing a very good job.Then we get to Amy. For someone who's never acted really, I think she could not have been better. Most of the negative reviews focus on two things: the so called ""vulgarity"" of the movie, and Amy herself. So many people are unable to keep the way they personally feel about this young woman out of the mix. This movie is sharply panned mainly because of Amy haters. And I'm not just saying ""hater"" like the kids say these days. Some people HATE her. I think it's ridiculous. Grow up!People get SO offended by Ms. Schumer that it seems like they're going to have a mental breakdown. And the vulgarity? Really?? So you didn't know what to expect from the trailer, or the movie poster, or any of her stand-up? Yeah, right. Look, it's odd to go to a movie that you should know is going to be offensive, and then act surprised when you're offended by it. You know what that makes you? Weird. It makes you weird.Trainwreck deserves better treatment than it got. She deserves to at least be treated like one would a male comedian. She's a brash, raunchy female comedian who's found her niche and made some money, and some people can't stand that. Well, too bad. Women with personalities, attitudes and opinions are here to stay, so you'd better get used to it. I can't believe I have to express that in 2017. You don't have to give her a break, but it wouldn't kill you to ignore her instead of eviscerate her at every turn."

",-0.4404,-0.5583,2017-05-19 00:00:00,1,"Just awful in every way...and she is not funny at all...I was truly expecting more from this and found myself, very disappointed.In the movie, she seems to be trying too hard and winds up being that typical girl ( the ones who are superficial, materialistic, and fake) that every guy avoids on a daily basis....I would run far away from this one"
" OK plot, Some smile happened, Bad casting, Leading actress in particular.
",0.2342,0.7693,2017-05-16 00:00:00,3,"The story revolved around a messed up girl who gets drunk, high and have sex a lot with different guys which would have been much more suitable if it was a hot actress instead of Spamela Hamderson. But since it's not, it kinda felt wrong for the whole movie. Even the sister, who is supposed to be a much more conservative person, looks hotter. No wonder Hamderson wrote the story herself just to fulfill her dream as a hot bangable girl. Not sure if her performance was so good or it was real her, because she was so annoying all the time. Not a single laugh I had, a few smiles at best. 3 stars I gave go for Bill Hader, John Cena and LeBron James who actually put a smile on my face."
" Very funny and surprisingly warm-hearted
",0.6865,0.9126,2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Putting aside the promiscuous sex, the underage sex, the drugs, alcohol and excessive profanity, the graphic knee replacement surgery and death, it's a very funny and surprisingly warm-hearted rom-com.The film starts with a very funny flashback of Amy's father, played by Colin Quinn, explaining to his two very young daughters why monogamy doesn't work. Moving to the present day, the movie follows Amy's complicated relationship with her father, her sister, her co- workers, and men. Lots of men.Not for the faint-hearted or for children, and probably not a good first-date movie, it's well worth seeing now. And for my single friends (and you know who you are) it provides hope that everyone can ultimately find Mr. or Ms. Right.Check it out."
" Very Funny
",0.4927,0.9549,2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a greatly directed, written, and acted movie. Schemer is hilarious and delivers her lines spot on and i was shocked that she could act with man emotions. She is funny, sad, and angry and plays it all off very well. Also the ending is very funny and satisfying with a great song at the end. (One of my favorites:)) Go see it its a great comedy!"
" Yikes! More Tripe from Amy Schumer
",0.0,0.6757,2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,"Awful, tasteless and puerile.Some good parts but very far and few between.Another failed comedian trying to turn a quick buck leveraging past glory. Another formulation movie playing safe and with poor acting and script.Amy Schumer is irrelevant and past her prime."
" Recycled Garbage, Again!
",0.0,-0.3079,2017-05-03 00:00:00,1,"If you took every decent scene out of every romcom from the 80's and 90's and tried to group them together into some incoherent 90 minute commercial, you would get Trainwreck.Nothing in this film is original except for the fact that there's an ugly, fat woman starring in a romcom. It's a little hard to get caught up in a love story involving a pig-faced moron, but they gave it a shot and failed miserably.Scores are inflated, this thing deserves a 3.0 like her other work."
" Starts off well
",0.2732,-0.8871,2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"This film starts off as a funny, lively comedy about a slutty party girl, played by Amy Schumer. Her scenes with John Cena's character are very good. However, the film turns into a drama when the protagonist inexplicably quickly changes into being monogamous after starting a relationship with Bill Hader's character. This relationship isn't believable at all, nor is it entertaining. There's no way that she'd want someone as dull as him, nor that he would want a promiscuous drunk like her. His acting is wooden and he derails the film rather than adding anything useful to it.There are two sex scenes, but it's disappointing that we don't see her body properly in either. In the one with Cena she's not nude; in the one with Hader, it's dark. Schumer should be flying the flag for curvy girls, showing off how hot she is.There's a dreadful, miserable, unnecessary subplot about her father being chronically ill and dying. This is totally out-of-place in a comedy film and adds nothing positive or useful to it."
" so incredibly boring and overall bad
",-0.7485,-0.8585,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"Didn't even finnish it, because it was so lame - acting was bad, the story was to predictable, seen it all before, just an overall bad movie. Only funny very few places, but the jokes are super unintelligent, and lame, which in my opinion makes them not funny what so ever. The plot is just a rip-off of every rom-com ever made. So if you are looking for wasting your time with something worthless, this is the movie."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.9081,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Certainly amusing, with a few actual LOLs, but nothing out of the ordinary. John Cena is a good sport. Amazing performance from Tilda Swinton, who plays bitch boss from hell. I didn't recognise her until I read the cast list for another reason, which I always think is a sign of a good performance, even though I hated the character, (I don't think anyone could possibly do otherwise). Watch it if you're into rom coms, but come in with low expectations to avoid disappointment."
" Really, Really Bad
",-0.6214,0.7426,2017-03-19 00:00:00,1,"It sure seems like Amy Schumer is getting less and less funny as time goes by, and any TV or movie that she's in is made less funny by her appearance in it. I mean, she's never been a comedy dynamo, but she was fairly amusing when she started out - now she come across like a vengeful, spoiled brat-shrew. And getting drunk just doesn't cut it as a comedy staple anymore."
" Regular solid formula movie.
",0.1531,0.9755,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,This is your basic formula romance movie with a little twist. Not worthy of a 10 but certainly not worthy of a 2 or 3. It's a solid average movie that a couple should enjoy.There are some pretty funny sex scenes with her bodybuilder boyfriend. She is pretty funny as an actress and has some good sardonic lines.
" Not good except for the acting
",-0.3412,0.9863,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"I expected this film to be a proper comedy. Why? Because it was advertised as a comedy, it was talked about as a comedy, the promos by the main actors sold the general public that this was a comedy. And it is not.This is mostly a family drama mixed with a romantic drama mixed with gross humour mixed with some humour. The story is mildly entertaining, it is unoriginal, definitely not a comedy. It tackles too many things at once and without any focus, depth, or any level of success. There are too many characters in the film and some of them don't add anything to the story. There isn't real digging into the psyche of the main character played by Schumer.The main thing I enjoyed in the film was the acting. Schumer is a good actress and she's convincing as the alcoholic comittophobic Amy. I also liked Bill Hader as the normal-guy boring doctor, and I thought that he and Schumer had chemistry on camera, but he had more comic chemistry with Lebron James (I loved Lebron!). Tilda Swinton is always brilliant, even here, as the unrecognizable dull glamazon journo boss Dianna.Overall, I found the film passable and a bit boring. I was expecting a comedy and, therefore, to laugh often, but that didn't happen."
" absolute waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.9361,2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"This film was the most unimaginative cliché rubbish that i could barely stand to watch. Was bored from start to the point where i had to stop watching because it was so predictable, complete misrepresentation of what monogamy means and what it means to not be monogamous. This film essentially creates the impression that people who don't conform to monogamy are slags, which isn't necessarily true. Sloppy and cliché, would not recommend and was a complete waste of time to watch, the plot was confusing to follow and too much going on to actually get to the point of the film, which in turn was equally as awful as it did not realistically reflect real life at all. I fail to comprehend how this film could be seen as funny, when it was dryer than the Sahara."
