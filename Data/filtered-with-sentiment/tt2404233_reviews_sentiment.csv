" Gods of Egypt
",0.0,0.9932,2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"It's Aladdin meets Prince of Persia in Egypt!
An exciting take on a film based on Egyptian mythology.
I thought it was a pretty good cinematic experience
It's not the same old dried up version, bland nothing but sand in Egypt
They brought Egypt to life using color, gold, water, space and earth
Egyptian gods and mythology are major theme in the film and is utilized in a way that is relatable to the audience
The visuals are amazing, storyline was great, pacing was smooth and the acting was good
It's a story about love, sacrifice and redemption
I realized I'm attracted to women who wear gold for some reason
I couldn't get enough of Elodie Yung who plays Hathor the Goddess of Love
She looked lovely üíõ"

It may not have a top-notch plot but the plot is good enough the acting is good and the visually effects are delightful. Embedded in the plot is a love story that you can relate to with a lot of fun adventure and action. Gerard Butler is a convincing antagonist , and I really enjoyed this movie all in all. Give it a watch!"

",0.0,0.9857,2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Just watched this film (March 2021). I really enjoyed the whole film. Some great CGI effects. I loved the twists and turns about the gods and the way they acted and when the Sphinx got the correct answer and he just went ""Bother"" which I thought was brilliant. The love story that ran through the film was good as well. I also loved the touches of Indiana Jones. All in all a really enjoyable film.

",0.0,-0.9467,2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,"Why did i even watch this? If you think a cruise ship style dance show is fun, this might be up your sleeve. It's a shallow and ridiciously overstylized Ancient Egypt fan fiction. Story-wise barely above a B-movie-level and that reflects in the acting. Gerald Butler with his heavy accents is never believeable as any kind of ancient egyptian. He doesn't even care, he is just having fun.Visually this probably most reflects a Las Vegas slot game. Gold, gold and more gold, it's gratuitous. The CG is competent in some moments but aweful most of the time. It's simply overused, the whole movie turns into a reality ignoring motion ride far too often.It's so bad that it almost makes the jump to ""so bad it's good""-territory. Almost."
" Someday those that frequent this website will understand the meaning of the word ""entertainment""!
",0.0,0.9907,2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Once again, there are those that frequent this website that have no earthly idea what the meaning of the word entertainment is. So many have crucified this movie for a host of ridiculous reasons; over the top CGI, weak plot, silly and cheesy storylines, etc. etc, blah, blah, blah....
Holy cow...how many reviews am I gonna have to put on here before people are finally enlightened to the truth?!
What truth do I speak of? The truth that ever movie is not meant to be the Lord of the Rings, or Shawshank Redemption, or Citizen Kane, or Avengers Endgame. My God in heaven above...BE ENTERTAINED for crying outloud.
This movie is full of over the top action and CGI and silly plot stuff, but it was NOT meant to be A Few Good Men or Schindler's List. It's a move that you and your kids can sit down by the fire on Sunday night with a plate full of chocolate chip cookies and HAVE FREAKUN FUN WATCHING MOVIE!! It is exactly what it is supposed to be. It did not win any Oscars. It will NOT be the best movie you have ever seen. But gees people, how many movies actually fall into those categories?
This movie is fun. Gerard Butler does a fantastic job as usual. The rest of the actors do ok, but no one is going to win an oscar. You have giant fire breathing cobras, a giant earth eating demon, and a great air dogfight between Set the Egyptian god of Darkness and Horus the Lord of the Air that is pretty dadgum cool. It also features some pretty good acting from Nikolaj Waldau (from Game of Thrones fame), Geoffrey Rush ( a season vet who always does well) and Courtney Eaton of Mad Max Fury Road fame (one of the hottest young female actresses in the known universe).
So...quit with the ridiculous critique of this movie. Enjoy it for what it is and what it was meant to be...a fun action movie. If you see it for anything else, then YOU don't deserve the right to critique it.
Enjoy the movie and be entertained. Rant over, have a nice day."

It's simply a fun movie night movie that you won't remember the next day but it's good enough to watch if your bored. The plot is weak and the acting is ok, if their were other actors less skilled it would be much worse but the acting isn't half bad. So to put simply one last time it's an OK Movie you'll watch one time for a brainless movie night and never watch it again lol."
" Gods of Egypt (3D)
",0.0,0.9936,2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"A fun movie that doesn't try to be anything more than that.
The cast is good, the characters are fun and the directing is decent.
Gerard Butler is hilarious as Set but the other characters are
fun too, especially Geoffrey Rush as Ra.
An entertaining film work that does not take itself seriously and
thus gives us an escape from reality, and that is the
primary purpose of the film.
The effects are good, and it's especially fun to see Ra fighting Apophis.
The 3D effects are also not bad and make the movie more fun to watch.
In short, decent entertainment with good visuals and interesting
and fun characters."
" A perfectly acceptable watch.
",0.7579,0.9839,2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"I didn't mind this film, it's the type of thing you can put on one Saturday afternoon and it doesn't matter if someone drops by or if you have to go to the loo, you can just leave it running, because it's a fairly simple storyline with a very obvious ending, which lets face it we've all see before in one film or another. Sometimes easy films are just what we need.According to the IMDB Trivia section IT IS based on an Egyptian Legend/Myth/Religion? But I prefer to look at it as a complete work of fantasy fiction, because it would just be too complicated to try to understand all of the Gods and their relationships and how true to the original papyrus texts this story might be. It's also because I don't think you can even vaguely think of this as anything but fiction, so extreme and fanciful is it that you would never believe it.I actually think it might have worked better as a cartoon/CGI film. Their voices all worked fine for that, but came across as a bit corny otherwise. In fact it was a bit hammy too and quite a lot of cheesey as well. You could have made a picnic out of it all with the Beefy men on top of the rest (I wish Gerrard Butler was on top of me).It's difficult to distinguish Nikolaj from his role as Jaime Lannister in 'Game Of Thrones' and in actual fact I think he would have worked better if he'd swapped roles with Gerrard and vice-versa. They are both very handsome fellas, so I don't mind too much, but the guy playing Bek was just annoyingly bad.
I'm assuming that it was a directors choice to go down the route of Cheese and Ham, because I've definitely seen these actors do better. The star in the mix was Geoffrey Rush, who, although a very extreme character, managed to keep his Ra acceptable for any film.I also didn't know what was wrong with Chadwick Bozeman's voice, it was a bit all over the place. It was almost as frustrating as Gerrard's eye liner and hair dye job.In the right studio, producer and directors hands and even with the same cast, I think that this story could actually be made very well, but it would have to be a proper epic with the time and budget to match or a Netflix series to rival 'Thrones'."

" Just hopeless
",-0.4588,-0.9802,2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,"I don't know what frustrates me more. How this movie is terrible or how the crew making it just kept arguing over story problems and slammed everything together to ultimately make it terrible.Gods of Egypt is one of the worst fantasy movies ever made and a complete waste of time for everyone making it. It unfortunately is brought down by terrible writing that delivers a boring and unengaging story, ugly-looking visuals that often seem unfinished, poorly-crafted action scenes, a cast of boring and generic characters, unexpectedly offensive stereotypes, and TERRIBLE acting from celebrities involved where it's easily noticeable that they JUST DIDN'T CARE about this movie.In the case of the recommendation, just don't bother. This is one of the best examples there is of a movie that's not worth your time. I wouldn't recommend this to action junkies, since they'll be both bored and disgusted. Well, let's just hope we don't get any more crap like this anytime soon."

Even so, there needs to be a clear presentation of story, scenes that move the story forward, faithfulness to the myths of old, a relatable premise, and identifiable characters, this film accomplishes all those things. It's not oscar material, but it successfully comes together in a way that tells a complete story, with timeless themes including love, life, death, the afterlife, betrayal, honor, and friendship. My favorite character was Thoth, nicely played by the late Chadwick Boseman, who delivers his lines with an amusingly haughty self-confidence."

I appreciate the effort of spending 140 million on a fantasy film as I love fantasy but here it is money wasted. The dialogue isn't great, the battles aren't great, the scenery feels fake. It's a so-so blockbuster essentially. Greek mythology can be a little silly but they took it to the extreme here and it doesn't have to be.

",0.636,0.982,2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,"""Don't believe everything you read,"" is how the saying goes, and I say any negativity written about this movie must have been by the hand of negative people.Granted, I do love all that is Egyptian. That being said, I just re-watched this flick (again!) and was telling a friend I thought it was maybe one of the best movies ever made... I had to look it up online becuz I couldn't for the life of me remember the director's name, tho I knew he'd done Garage Days as well--another really cool flick, btw--and I was horrified by what I saw written about GoE. I had to actually double-check that it was the same movie. I have no idea where these people could be coming from.Everything about GoE was good, if not great. I'm not an action- or special fx-driven viewer, but what was presented in that respect was well done too. The attire of the cast was so outstandingly striking that I spent a long time trying to find out who the designer was. So okay, I guess there was one thing lacking in that after reading the credits over and over, the titles given to the wardrobe people still left me with no clue as to who actually designed the clothing (so if anyone reading this can decipher it down to a name for me, I'd really like to know who it was that did such a good job). And that's about all the ""negativity"" you'll get here. Maybe the ""bombing at the box office"" has more to do with cool people opting to watch at home instead of paying $20 to not be able to pause to go to the bathroom or not be able to have a smoke or drink than it has to do with the movie itself, that's the only thing I can figure.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's such a cool flick."

Ow yea sfx are great, i hear people aaying, but no, they are not. The enlarging effects (giant gods vs mortal human beings) went all wrong during a swam acene.

Yes the acting coulds have been better, but there is so much CGI included everywhere to develop the 'gods' side of this world, that it must have been hard to keep in character all the time when you're talking to the air.
This will be the single little flaw I saw in this movie. I don't care about Egyptian Gods don't looking Egyptian, after all who knows how they looked like? It's a fantasy setting, and it's obvious that the production staff had a lot of fun adding references to other mythologies and other views of how a world with Gods living among us,would have looked like.Because yes, it didn't have to be a perfect carbon copy of what we know about Egyptian mythology. This was an original world. And it was absolutely gorgeous."

",0.3506,0.9828,2020-08-15 00:00:00,4,"Much like how Clash of the Titans (2010) and Immortals mined Greek mythology to respectable commercial success, Gods of Egypt is an attempt to mine what ""blockbuster potential"" there is to be had from Egyptian mythology. Based in a world where Gods are 12 Feet tall, live among humans, and bleed gold, the film follows Mortal thief Bek and exiled God Prince Horus in their journey to take down usurper Set for differing reasons. The movie does look nice as there's tons of detail with fantastical structures and vivid colors, but then the novelty wears off when everything else fails to engage. Bek and Horus aren't compelling protagonists and the only fun to be had comes from Gerard Butler as Set giving a reasonably entertaining hammy villain performance. The spectacle is beautiful, but if there's nothing engaging you it has about the same entertainment value as a theme park ride, except theme park rides at least have the decency not to be two hours long. If you need your ancient Egyptian trash blockbuster fix, stick with Brendan Fraser's first two Mummy movies or Roland Emmerich's Stargate."

Shelley's great sonnet 'Ozymandias' which reads: ""Look on Gods of Egypt, ye filmgoers, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of this colossal wreck, boundless and bare. The lone and level sands stretch far away."" I have quoted these lines because to me they are an accurate description of this brainless, soulless, insipid film. Despite featuring a solid cast, 'Gods of Egypt' is a massive failure which follows the standard formula of a conventional and boring action film with uninteresting characters and careless dialogue and stupid fantasy sequences. It is a fatally flawed and creatively inept effort. I will never understand why this film has got at least a 5.4 / 10 in this platform, it really doesn't deserve to pass. It takes away the fun of the sophisticated and fascinating Egyptian pantheon of deities. Overall it feels like a video game, not like a film. Come one, just look at the poster, it is telling you: 'This is going to be a bad film'. The elaborate visual effects and its cast are the only merits I can see in this deeply flawed adventure movie. You can watch it if there's nothing else in TV, and you'll probably be entertained by its lifeless fun. But on the whole this is a godless vision of Egypt.Grade: 2.3 / 10"

" MASTERPIECE. IT GROWS ON YOU BECAUSE

It's a very different kind of fantasy mythology movie but in a great way. Critics that troll hate on great ENTERTAINMENT need to sit down and stop trying to desuade audiences away from terrific productions. And that in an epic nutshell is what God's of Egypt is all about.

Seeing comparisons with this film to Clash of the Titans, but even though that film isn't great, it is easily more entertaining and enjoyable than Gods of Egypt.This film as a whole was quite generic, bland and overly long. A story that is predictable and doesn't really offer much of anything new or fresh. Decent visuals but that is to be expected considering its large budget.

I mainly loved the scenery designs, they were amazing and some character designs were good too, but I really disliked how the Gods look, at moments the CGI was really bad, and the green screen was too noticeable. Most of the fighting scenes were absolutely abusing rotating cameras, to the point it was annoying.
Also the diealogues were quite cheesy and the story quite predictable and full of cliches.
As a balance of the movie, I've got very beautiful landscapes and designs in general, kind of likeable characters and a lot of action, but it's definitely not to be taken too seriously, besides the fantasy, it's quite silly."

Before I realize, I'll be zapping between tv stations, do something else on my pc or turn off the dvd. (I don't go to cinema's much.)This movie held me in my seat watching.
It a has a modern day make-over to a classic old epic movie from back in the day.
I loved all the color representing good times, while the bad times are mostly less bathed in bright colors.
As for the gods being bigger than mortals, nice touch!, but I do feel that these ancient and almighty gods could have had some more godly powers, I mean what god would walk the desert if he is able to ""think"" himself to his destination...., after all they created everything.The story was quite entertaining, the plot was somewhat predictable but it did have some unexpected and pleasant twists.
CGI wasn't mindblowing but it fitted in nicely enough to not be annoyingly present. (Meaning bad)My conclusion, not a masterpiece but not as bad as critics claim it to be.
Despite my ADD I watched it a couple of times now and not once did ai feel bored or felt the need to turn it off.
If a movie keeps me in my seat and makes me want to see what happens next, it's a good movie in my opinion.Note: I like to watch all types of movies, except certain rom-coms, so this review is not written by a person who has a narrow perspective on movies!"

The use of so much CGI and ultimately wooden acting is very reminiscent of how I feel about those films. Some effects actually don't look that bad, whereas others look horrible. For example, the scene with the giant snakes didn't look terrible in terms of CGI. But the scene with the minotaurs looked horrendous. The action is at times laughable, but there are other times where it actually looks pretty damn great. And the soundtrack is amazing.Not a great movie at all, but it's still kind of a guilty pleasure of mine. If you haven't seen ""Gods of Egypt"", you're not missing a whole lot.

" Entertaining Movie
",0.4404,-0.7511,2019-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I think some of the negative reviews about this film are missing the point. It is not supposed to be a documentary about Egyptian religion. It is a fantasy movie - and actually compared to some of the other takes on belief systems which have turned up recently (think Thor and Loki here) it is actually not that far out. Trying to explain the exact details of how the Egyptian pantheon worked would be beyond the scope of any movie, particularly as it changed over time and would not be entertaining to anyone who wasn't a scholar on the subject anyway. As to the subject of white actors - if you are going to have 10 feet tall gods, boats sailing through space and giant fire breathing worms I think you can give up on that kind of accuracy. Anyway, I enjoyed it. Sort of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" for the 21st century."

(i was already very tired and sleepy when i started this on Roku free movies + ads at around 01:30a last night and was about to fall asleep involuntarily a couple of times near the end but did manage to keep awake trying not to miss a moment ...)i'll probably watch it again if i do get the time later ... preferably on a larger screen (mine's a 40"" old TOSHIBA flat screen placed about 12' from where i was sitting) and i may as well even buy a copy for keeps as it is truly worth it ...again, forgive the not so realistic mythical storyline plus its somewhat mundane wrappings (as we ought to do in most similar cases anyway!) and just enjoy the VFX and SFX and lovely music in addition to some beautiful characters ... and you'll most probably like it just like i did! :-)"

" Gods Of Egypt Review
",0.0,-0.405,2019-04-13 00:00:00,6,"In ancient Egypt, where deities living among mortals, the exiled god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) attempts to reclaim his throne and his people from the wicked Set, and only a mortal peasant can help him.
In the past, Alex Proyas has created seductive gothic worlds, notably in The Crow and Dark City. He stumbles into the garish sun for this catastrophe, shining unkind light on a story both misconceived and badly executed. It is hard to sweep away everything that's terrible to see any tiny kernel of what may have at some point seemed like a good idea.
This is the Dolly Parton of movies, without any of the wit.
In a fantasy Egypt where gods rule and most Egyptians are white with English accents, evil god Set (Gerard Butler, separating himself from the crowd by being Scottish) kills his brother Osiris, blinds Osiris' son Horus (Coster-Waldau) and steals his throne. With the help of a peasant thief (Brenton Thwaites), Horus attempts to reclaim the crown and set his people free. Thwaites is saddled with a sodden lump of a role, trying to give charming cockiness to a character written as simply arrogant. Every time he evades death is a disappointment.
It's a film that reeks of money, big swooping shots stretching on for digitally created miles and golden costumes glinting, but it's money badly spent. All the effects look like they missed a final pass, shiny with that glossy mid-'90s artificiality. It brings to mind the Dolly Parton line, ""It costs me a lot of money to look this cheap"". This is the Dolly Parton of movies, without any of the knowing wit.
The plot is lurid and camp, which could have been quite fun if Proyas had embraced it, but he tries to give it a weight it can't support, forcing needlessly dense mythology that confuses convolution with depth. With all the toys at his disposal here Proyas might have been expected to at least throw in some exciting action, but there's an afterthought, samey quality to the set pieces, the majority finding our heroes jumping off a ledge and hoping for the best. It's not even spirited enough to be enjoyably awful.
Summer 2016 has had a high number of shonky blockbusters, but Gods Of Egypt is the worst of them."

" Breathtaking CGI of Ancient Egypt and and Excellent Movie by Great Director
",0.8957,0.9768,2019-02-26 00:00:00,9,"This was the movie where White-Washing as a standard was initiated by PC Critics/Journalists who decided to destroy this movie if they could. So almost all the negative reviews are based in great part on this issue. An unbiased analysis: CGI is excellent, as the gods are 50% larger than normal humans, can change form, and it all looks as natural as it could for this mythical view. Ancient Egypt - it's gods, cities, monsters, and landscape are brilliantly depicted. The Action is mostly good, although the hero does hop thru a few too many scenes and mazes such that the last was definitely too much. Acting is very good, with top flight performances by all the major parts. Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Gerard Butler were all at their best. I found the Love Story & interplay between the goddess of love and her 2 suitors to be quite unique and interesting, with Yung as much more than a pretty face. It isn't supposed to be a History Lesson, but a Fantasy and Proyas showed intimate understanding of Egypt and her gods. It is a fun movie to watch, and I have done so over 20 times already."

Liked the premised of 10 feet tall gods, it worked pretty much like a super-hero movie. Especially liked the characters, with everybody except being fairly immoral and cynical, and then some of them gradually realizing, maybe cynicism is not a good thing when a madman is destroying the world. I liked the humor a lot, and the interplay between Horus and Bek. Zaya was absurdly beautiful. It was a surprising turn of events for me she got killed so fast in the movie, only to return later on. It doesn't happen often that the death of an important character catches you completely off guard!I was very surprised it got so many many negative reriews. I suspect the reason is that it drew a crowd of genuinely historically-mythologically interested people, expecting to see a more serious sort of movie, with historically correct details and being dialogue-heavy with mythology. explanations. And then no you're not going to like it - same as if you try to watch a Marvel Thor movie for Viking mythology.So I hope it doesn't go forgotten like some of Proyas other movies.

Gods of Egypt is a fun fantasy film that takes the idea of the Egyptian gods and comes up with a whole new story that's full of action, adventure, comedy and romance. Truly an epic movie.I see a lot of complaints about this movie and I honestly can't understand them. People complaining that the story isn't authentic. Well, that is sort of the point. They're not retelling the myths and legends of Egypt, they're taking the characters out of those stories and making something entirely new out of them. Something fun and original, instead of yet another remake of the same trash we've seen copy and pasted into a thousand different films. Originality, especially when it's so wonderfully presented, should NEVER be stifled.As for those complaining that the movie ""looks bad"" or has ""cheesy CGI"", it's clear that they've not been watching the same movie as everyone else. Because this movie is beautiful. The special effects are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and they just put so much effort into every last detail. I've seen movies with 100 times the budget not look anywhere near this polished.Gods of Egypt is what we need to see Hollywood do more of.

Yet this, and every other film about ancient Egypt casts a white actor as the ruler of Egypt.""Europeans"" of Egypt is yet another demonstration of ""liberal"" ""inclusive"" ""progressive"" Hollywood's propagation of white supremacy. They even included the typical token black character as they often do to ease their hypocritical, liberal conscience. Now that I know (according to Hollywood) Europeans ruled Egypt as Kings, Queens, and Gods; and they created the universe, my indoctrination is complete.It is extremely unfortunate that due to their inherit racism, Hollywood glorifies all things historically white such as Greece, Rome, and England. I can't count the amount of movies based on these three sick and depraved civilizations. The extremely rare occasion Hollywood puts money into a period-based, non-white civilization, they cannot resist themselves and must use even those civilizations to glorify White Supremacy by inserting Europeans into the roles of leadership, royalty, and Gods.I am sorry if this reality stings a few toes, which is not my intent. I am just sick to my teeth of Hollywood liberals preaching inclusiveness and diversity, when their films are anything but inclusive beyond the typical token-black character. When it comes to rubber meeting the road, and non-white actors getting lead roles, their White Supremacy propaganda films are anything but inclusive. This film, Europeans of Egypt, is additional proof of their ""progressive"" hypocrisy.As to the story, the overall imaginary premise gave this film potential. Unfortunately the dull writing, clumsy plot, and cartoony CGI fails to meet any mark. Europeans of Egypt writing and imaginary effects reminds me of the writing and effects of the 1930's sci-fi series, Flash Gordon.If you just want to see a movie with special effects and cartoon-like CGI, you will love this movie.""Liberal"" Hollywood is still one of the most powerful racist institutions in America. They introduce one new African American talent for every three-hundred new white up-and-comers. They voice the need for diversity and inclusiveness, but appear to be referring to diverse height and hair color among the majority European cast. Hollywood has become slightly more subtle with their overly-blatant racism compared to the days of their greatest creation, the late actor ""Stepin Fetchit"" (look him up) as well as the TV show called ""Beulah"" (look this up on YouTube).Europeans of Egypt had a lot of potential and could have even evolved into a franchise, but Hollywood could not overcome their century-old nature of exalting members of the European culture over the historical culture of the region. They attempt to shove a racially inaccurate round peg into a square hole every time. Ever notice how they never exalt black rulers over Greece, Rome or England? Blacks in the movies are always slaves, servants, or a supporting role (aka token)."

I wasn't as focused on whether or not the actors were white or not.I thought this film was good- although it missed the mark somewhere. I would not call it great.I am certainly no professor of English, so excuse my ignorance in attempting this review. I miss alot trying to interpret films or books.But I did notice that of the hundreds of reviews below, only one tried to mention what this film was about (The myth of Tep Zepi fused with Osiris/Isis myth). I found zero reviews mentioning metaphor. Maybe its a mistake to even try as nobody else seems to be.Anyway, to me it seemed like one of the key messages was that Horus, God of Air, is noted for keen vision. And if Horus is blind, watch out- because chaos and entropy and all sorts of demons lurk just beyond the realm of the known.I feel you could go deeper in analyzing, but not with my limited skill. So for me, it is a reasonable action film (that sometimes feels too video gamey), with some deep underlying messages, that we would do well to remember even today.An action flick, with a moral?

I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie...a lot!Sure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive ""heroes"" and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.I actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not ""ethnically correct"". What the f...? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise...Yes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.The rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called ""critics"". No surprise there.It is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.I would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection."

The first step is to try to recover Horus' eyes, following which a trip to sun-God grandfather Ra is on the cards.The word ""hokum"" (loosely defined as ""theatrical nonsense"") isn't used very much these days, but hokum is exactly what this film is.. Loaded up from start to finish with state of the art CGI, over the top performances (which include some extremely bad acting - no, let's call it ""mannered performances"" - from Chadwick Boseman and Elodie Yung), straight-faced earnestness from Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, and a story which dips into Egyptian mythology but never lets it interfere with its daft story, it doesn't take itself seriously for a minute, and the commendably straight-faced players convey an underlying awareness of their participation in, well, hokum. And I do like films which are tripe, know they are tripe, and aren't ashamed of it (see also: Drive Angry).I loved the look of this film. The Egyptian mythology feeds into the production design, the fact that these double-sized Gods co-exist with mortals is achieved well (better than in Peter Jackson's Rings/Hobbit films). The action was well-staged, I loved the overall daftness, and I found Courtney Eaton's bulgy cleavage utterly delightful.

" The legend of Zep Tepi
",0.0,0.9669,2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,"I've just watched recently on Blu Ray Gods Of Egypt, it was a very enjoyable ride.
If the production were using more sets construct it could it been an epic, but that i leave it to the filmmakers.
The story is part accurate part fable.It is the time of Zep Tepi (The Fist Time) when the Ancient Gods ruled over men, and how they found them self's in troubles,and struggle by learning their mistake they have learned their lessen through the human beings.
The story folows based on the true myth of the Ancient Egyptian Gods, how Osiris was appointed ruler of Ancent Khemet with his sister Isis. It is the truth myth of the Pre-History of the Antediluvian world. aprox 10,000 - 12,000 BC when Atlantis was swallowe beneath the waves in the Atlantic Ocean.This is the missing pages of our forgotten history mind you.Is it hidden or a myths?
Set kills Osiris then cuts his body into pieces, and spreads them across Ancient Khemet Empire, Only one piece survives and that is the phallus of Osiris.Hiis loyal subject finds it and hands over to Isis the Queen of the Gods, She uses it and gets impregnated and she bores Horus, that set to be the ruler of the throne of Khemet. Horus grows and become mighty warrior that go into battle with Vimanas against Set and fight in a mighty battle he is hit with a laser bear from the ship of set and dropes down. He is badly injured he heals then he goes on a journey to the hidding place of Set and kills him at Mount Sinai. At the same time Isis is set on the quest to find every piece and to resurrect her beloved husband Osiris. It is the Quest of Immortality.This is the true myth.The move should be made that way but because of sexual contents depraved from the story Alex Proyas uses the corner stone of the myth and changes the elements of the story to develop that led to a different interpretation of the Zep Tepi.
A lot of people don't understand the concept of myths that is the history of bygone age of the real quest to immortality and their struggle with their ruling over men. That is the true history of the Gods.
I like one particular element that is straight from Zacharia Sitchin pages, The Gods were angry at all times and thirst for vengeance, they didn't have emotions. and that is their fall. Only humans have those emotions that make us different and better then the Gods.
In fact the Truth myth is Amon-Ra is not the father of Osiris and Set instead is Atlas the last king of Atlantis. Ancent Khemet is in fact the Osirian Empire that stretches through out the whole Mediterranean Basin, Lybia and Egypt it was a colony of the Atlantian Empire.The madeteranin Basin at hat time bas a valley tith lakes and rivers that is now submurged. King Atlas and the Queen Mu gave authority to Osiris to rule Ancent Khemet, but his brother Set been subjugated by the dark side fell short and become a jealous Prince that wanted to kill his elder brother Osiris. He wanted to be the ruler of Egyptian/Lybian Empire that was in parallels of the Atlantian Empire.In Ancent Khemet they used Vimanas that were fighting in mid air like the movie John Carter on Mars. Those elements should be incorporated into the story to make it an epic production it needed to be a cross between Thor and Lord of the Rings.
The move its self is better then Scorpion King in production and story and better interpenetration of the Gods as 9 foot giants then in the movie Immortals, that was lacking.
The Gods were 12 - 15 feet but that could it been outstanding or impossible to be made in comparison to the humans for the big picture.
The Ancient Gods from Egypt were in fact the Sumerian Gods Anunnakies that were 33 feet, then as they lived on out planet and of the gravitation force their life span dropped same as the height.
When you look at their family chart Osiris and Set fits with their third generation ruling Gods on our planet. the second been Amun and Amaunet .
Lot of critics complain about using to much white actor to interpret the Gods, they wrong, because the Ancent Gods were fair hair and white skin, the Anunnkies.
The Creation of their second class humans were the Dark skin or Bronze skin in Africa and those were the the mining class They used the proto-typed Proncozul the original earthly beings. Their first race was the Titans been the dark skin Giants, their second creation were the Cyclops and Spinx, Gryphons and other Monsters, then comes the Apes, right after their six generation they have had created the Humo-Humo Sapians the Adamites, been the same as their likenesses.
Lets created men in our image to be the same as our likeness.
The move it is fun to watch if you don't take it seriously. The SGI were cheaply made but some scenery were gorgeous. They showed the Earth or Shan been a Flat Star Ship not a sphere.probably that is how they've interpreted in those times, It might it been true. Everything that we know now is not new i fits the legacy of the Gods that we call it magic in fact it is their science and advance technology that we use a fragment in our society nowdays.Itas been lost or hidden in the course of time, ready to be discovered.
Only time will tell how we will interpret those myths or been our lost history that is stored in our subconsciousness in every humans, that needs to be revealed.The movie is very good It could it been an epic if they used more real sets construction and incorporated those elements above.
They have spend a lot of money on their costumes that were breathtaking and on the wizardly, not so much on the production sets.
But I don't want to ruin the imagination of the Director, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
" Ancient Egyptians were 100% Caucasian
",0.0,-0.6908,2018-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Now that we have black cowboys and mythical black kingdoms wreaking vengeance on the white man, certain people cannot abide any historical narrative that is actually historical. The most recent DNA evidence in 2017 of 151 mummies shows Egyptians were white for most of their history and Nubian Africans did not contribute genetic material until the last 1500 years. It is a shame that rabid, anti-white racists would rather destroy careers and investments than allow history to be revealed. This movie was so thoroughly trashed, despite being a fantasy, they lost money by making an excellent film."

",0.7815,0.9979,2018-02-06 00:00:00,7,"First things first: this movie is silly, ridiculous and totally immune to any kind of criticism based on history, cultures, religions or ethnic backgrounds. Nothing about this movie even pretends to be serious.Gods of Egypt is a throwback. If you're older, you remember those weird movies Hollywood used to push back in the day when everything was supposedly possible, even in black&white. You'd see amazing things, ambitious and grand settings, horrible special effects and cheesy acting. You were entertained in a way that's hard to describe. It was ridiculous, but yet charming. Gods of Egypt has a lot of those elements.At its heart this is an adventure movie. There is young love, everyman characters among/against the gods, all kinds of fantastical scenery, quick pacing, plenty of back-and-forth dialogue to keep us entertained, tons of action and the ""hero's journey"" (two, in fact). Many characters have real character arcs, and the movie is never boring. It's simple, it's effective and it's quaint. It's what many movies used to be before we - the audience - decided that there is no more room for silly fantastical movies and everything must be dour, dark, believable and serious (not to mention the sensitive political climate). Movies now have rules restraining them, but I'm glad Gods of Egypt has no idea what ""restraint"" means. I'll get the bad things out of the way. This movie is so fast, so full of action, settings and dots to connect that sometimes it feels like many ""important"" plot points or moments are just quickly breezed by, and the impact was often lost. Many of the effects look bad (but I count that as a plus, more about that soon), and some of the fight scenes aren't shot or edited well. Whenever there's fantastical action, you're not even sure what's happening. There are times when this movie becomes a blur. Some of the acting is cheesy, but remember: most of the actors know exactly what kind of a movie they're in.More about the effects and the acting. Often the special effects are bad - and just bad enough that you're enjoying it as a modern version of an old movie where the effects were just as noticeable, only this time it's CGI instead of some elaborate trickery. They're also interesting enough to watch so you don't get bored. It's so fitting, and I can't hold it against the film - on the contrary, the mood was set early on. This is cheese, this is schlock. The actors knew it too, almost every one of them, and it's fun in a surreal way to see a bunch really respected actors in a movie like this. Only Nikolaj Coster-Waldau seemed to be unsure of how to play his character, but his natural charisma (which is ample) is enough. Gerard Butler is clearly having fun, and Elodie Yung along with Chadwick Boseman brings tons of energy to the cast. And if you don't at least smile when you see a very respected actor, Geoffrey Rush, hovering in the air and shooting magic lasers at some huge demonic worm beast while the Kingslayer is flying around in what looks like a weird Iron Man suit with wings, then I don't know what to tell you. Perhaps this isn't your movie.I cannot emphasize the amount of silly action enough. I'm not even sure if I knew what was happening in the last 30 minutes, but I was giggling nonetheless. It was so weird. This is entirely different than getting a sensory overload from a Transformers movie or something like that, so no fear. This movie isn't out to assault your senses, it's just hyperactive and a little clueless in an innocent way.I thoroughly enjoyed Gods of Egypt. It's bad in all the right ways, but it's also sincere and genuinely quaint at times. It even tries to tug at your heartstrings once or twice, and it can't quite get there, but even when it fails at something it still feels more honest than whatever pretentious blockbuster of the week, because there is simply no cynicism in this film. It will never be anything else than a ""fun movie"" but I'm glad I watched it. I have no ill feelings towards it. Yes, it's silly, insane and almost a B-movie in many ways, but it does so like a child. I can't get mad at it, and I hope none of the people involved are ashamed of it because movies like this bring real joy to many people. If I was 12 years old, this movie would be my personal treasure."
" Not-so high fantasy.
",0.0,0.9845,2018-02-06 00:00:00,3,"2016 has been a crazy year for movies for better or for worse. We've had a stunning continuation of both Kung Fu Panda and Star Trek, an onslaught of superhero movies (two of which had the heroes fighting each other), film adaptations of several video games like Warcraft, Disney remakes getting critical praise, and a terrifying return to Japanese cinema by Godzilla. Amongst this plethora of treasured entertainment is one stinking turd under the name ""Gods of Egypt"". Whenever Egypt is brought into American movies or even TV, the focus is usually on just mummies, pyramids, and booby traps and that's about it. This is why I appreciate the filmmakers for doing something different by delving into the actual mythology of this ancient civilization and much of it is quite fascinating. It's just a shame that none of that can make this movie any good. When god of the desert Set (Gerard Butler) murders his brother Osiris and steals the eyes of his nephew, sky god Horus, he begins his ruthless rule of the world with an iron fist, killing anyone who defies him be it man or god. A thief named Bek takes it upon himself to help Horus reclaim his eyes in exchange for resurrecting the woman he loves on an ""epic"" quest to save the world from Set's arrogance and cruel rule. On paper, this seems like a fun adventure, but its execution is lackluster. Very few of the characters are the least bit interesting with the exception of the likes of Ra (Geoffrey Rush), the god of light whose whole character and concept is pretty interesting, and Anubis not only has a cool design but is thankfully NOT portrayed as a villain so much as a guy who is simply doing his job managing the afterlife. I can't give the same credit to the rest of the cast as they are all just flat out boring. Seriously, I care for nobody here, especially Set, whose accent is not only distracting here, but the actor seems like he's got nothing invested in his role and the evil plan is clich√©d and full of holes. There's also the issue of ""White-washing"" in an Egyptian setting. I can see why people would be upset by this and I agree with them with the humans, though it's established that the gods can take on any form which is passable at most (still, they could be more ethnically accurate too).Many of the visuals have some cool designs, but it's all generic CGI. Almost nothing is physically present in front of the camera, not even the water the characters waddle in in one scene. THE FREAKIN' WATER! While not inherently bad itself, CGI is already overused these days and I found myself easily bored by the same illusionary trick within the first quarter of the film. The story is a tad needlessly complicated and too damn long. Somewhere in the middle, I was thinking to myself ""Is this mess gonna end anytime soon?"" The music also sucks as I don't remember a single musical note, which really says something. The action is okay with a couple of nice twists, but nothing truly spectacular. Batman and Superman fighting each other for just eight minutes is much more engaging than all the action ""Gods of Egypt"" had to offer. The best way to describe ""Gods of Egypt"" is a waste of time and money. To paraphrase ""The Mummy"": Compared to this, the Ten Plagues were a joy."
" Time to go fishing
",0.0,0.9603,2018-01-31 00:00:00,7,"This tale is inspired by the mythology of Egypt concerning the battle of Set (Gerard Butler) and Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Set murders King Osiris (Bryan Brown) and removes the blue eyes of Horus in battle as he takes over the throne and banishes Horus. Set imprisons the humans. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) a mortal and a thief loves Zaya (Courtney Eaton). He manages to steal an eye of Horus from Set and Zaya is killed as they flee Egypt. Bek makes a deal with Horus to get his girl back from the afterlife, but the clock is ticking. Yes, there is a love story in all of this.This tale was cleaned up a bit. There is no mention that the wives are also sisters and Horus' wife-sister was also his mother at one time. This was a common theme in ancient mythology. Horus was said to have blue eyes. They knew this and made his eye jewels blue, but not his actual eyes, apparently blue contacts would have broke the budget after spending a gazillion on special effects and great graphics. Loved the snakes. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Horus was very stiff.I know a lot of it was by design, but the character was boring. Gerald Butler fared a little better as Set, but the film needed help. Brenton Thwaites and many of the actors seemed held back as the film centered on special effects and not the characters. Rufus Sewell, Chadwick Boseman, and the scantily clad women I liked.Was that a polyethylene mattress that Bek landed on? Couldn't they have made it a bed of feathers?Great graphics. Mediocre acting. I never felt the excitement. Guide: No swearing. Implied sex. Camera angle prevents nudity in one scene."
" A spectacular meatloaf on the trails of Percy Jackson and the Gods of Egypt.
",0.0,0.9897,2018-01-28 00:00:00,4,"Messing around with myths, from Greek ones to Egyptian ones, is a cult in movies since the old glorious days of Cinecitt√† and the beginnings of Hollywood. I can't count how many Odisseus and Troy films have been made to these days, Clash of the Titans and so on. Being faithful to a mythological story is sometimes tricky when you want to make a good movie without being ridiculous but, nowadays, audience is more used to fantasy movies and fantastic stories so producer, writers and directors can be more bold. Maybe that's the fault, maybe a story based on a mythology (which means old funny religion) is a good ground for a stunning, eye candy, nonsense movie. The many discrepancies and anachronisms are often too much to allow this film to be called Gods of Egypt. The gods hierarchy is messed, the earth is depicted as flat (really??) while we know perfectly that Egyptians were perfectly aware of the roundness of our planet. and (once again after Stargate) gods (RAH) looks more like aliens (not that crap again) than deities.
Worth a look but not the box of popcorn and, certainly, not the cost of the disc."

When you can do absolutely anything, the anything you you do must be truly original and outstanding and that's a far harder trick to pull off.Not singling out this movie - many blockbusters that rely on CGI hit the same problem. Oh well...The often-dim lighting, yellow (sand/Egypt - geddit) cast and fast edits don't help with clarity, either.But it's not a bad movie, sadly it's just a bit of an average one.

" Transformers: Egyptian Style
",0.0,-0.5469,2017-12-02 00:00:00,5,"I have heard a lot people complaining about this movie, claiming that it's one of the worst movies ever made. With all that hoopla I thought I might give the movie a watch.The first thing that I noticed was the overwhelmingly white cast. I don't know why Hollywood continues to paint a wrong picture of historical events as they pertain to Egypt but this is done deliberately. I'm normally not much of a social justice warrior but this is something that's just disrespectful. I mean, have you ever seen a movie about the history of China that was cast almost entirely with white people? I don't think so. Then why the exception with Egypt? I digress.The movie starts out with a fair share of CGI effects which kind of gave me an idea as to what should be expected. The CGI wasn't very convincing so it seemed a little cheap at times. Especially the ""transformations"", they were quite goofy in my humble opinion. Nowhere in the hieroglyphs does it say that Egyptian gods are Transformers so I really don't get why they decided to go this route.Storytelling-wise the movie doesn't have much to offer. It's so one- dimensional that even a child could predict most of the occurrences beforehand. The deaths that occur during the movie are what I'd call ""premature death scenes"". Instead of waiting until some sort of emotional bond can be established with the viewer the characters just die way too early. So early indeed that no one really cares. Even the other characters in the movie seemed totally apathetic towards the deaths of their ""loved ones"". I call that bad storytelling.Towards the end the movie gets actually interesting. But unfortunately that's not enough. The negative points clearly outweigh the positive ones (of which there are few to begin with), I'm afraid.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I wouldn't recommend it either. The movie has a strong cast, weak story, and mediocre VFX."

The CGI was remarkable overall and who cares when things occasionally look slightly fake. Effects look fake in some classical monster movies, yet they are still great! Also there were some cracking one liners, this movie, is smarter than most. The movie is all about spectacle and, rarely for modern movies, it has a love interest story that is charming and adds to the movie, rather than subtracts. This movie is not taking itself too seriously and it is all about good old fashioned fun. I really recommend it. It's safe to ignore the sniffy critics in this case. A movie like this is 100% more entertaining than crap like Batman vs Superman, or The Mummy with that scientologist fool."

" Another predictable and protracted story where visual effects steal the show
",-0.4939,0.7277,2017-09-10 00:00:00,5,"With the development and spread of digital technology, many filmmakers have wanted to fulfill their past dreams of creating something visually powerful and with smooth inclusion, with a wow! effect for viewers in front of big screens. Thus, no more drawings within feature films or aliens resembling vessels of war, but fairy-tales, myths and sci-fi unfolding in a compact and truthful manner. Alas, this has often involved vain scripts, focusing on battles and motions, and over-the-shaft scenes for the sake of length and visualization. Besides, the cast is uneven, many characters come close to the ones seen before in other movies; even talented non-US character actors like Geoffrey Rush or Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are unable to fill the vacuity, the rest are nothing special - or too much ""hidden"" behind flashing environment and covering costumes. Lots of scenes are too long or provide no additional value, repeating obvious issues again and again.If it was the 1st movie of a kind, I would probably have rated it higher, but in 2016, it is just a copycat of dozens of myth-based movies of this millennium. Not a total flop, but no more than a mediocre work for those fond of ""nice"" stories where evil is defeated by good."

Seeing a movie like Gods of Egypt evokes the same feelings of awe and wonder from my childhood, but now with modern Hollywood quality CGI, looking better than anything from the fantasy films I watched as a kid.This is a visually impressive, imaginative, fun fantasy adventure with likable characters, in a classic story of good vs evil, in a unique setting, a fantastic version of ancient Egypt that's like nothing ever seen in real Earth history. What's not to like?Highlights: - An action scene with two gigantic fire-breathing snakes. This is why we watch action fantasy, for cool scenes like this.A giant world-eating space worm. I've seen plenty of CGI monsters, but this one managed to effectively convey a sense of size and scale never quite seen before. Awesome."

Continuing on in comparison, everyone serving the royals of color would be white.

That wasn't entertained for me. I didn't expect this unrealistic fight to happen like that, they would have made it better than what they did.Overall, the movie is entertained and you won't get bored while watching it, the actions happen fast which is good for a fantasy movie like this.I think they will release God of Egypt II to continue the story with other Gods of Egypt after ""Horus"", that would be great."
" This movie is actually good? WHAT?
",0.504,0.9373,2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"How often do I have to watch horrible films propped up to be greatest thing since the sliced bread only because they follow the trend our little globe is obsessed with at the time? How many times do I have to pass on a film because it made some people mad because it did not adhere to the trend of the week? The answer to both questions is infinite amount of times.Gods of Egypt as its title implies is a historical flick about the people living on Venus's moon number 12436 named Egypt... Wait what? it is actually a fantasy movie? About Mythological beings? Its cast is also actually diverse with a cast of people with different ethnicity? What is the problem then? I mean you do realise that there were no gods flying around Egypt some thousands of years ago right?Here is the thing, as a ""POC"" I am sick and tired of people talking for me all the time about how I should feel about stuff. This movie too is one of those cases. It was bashed to hell because its cast included white people and not black people (false since it does have black people, I mean come on, one of the gods is even black) which is a very bad argument for deciding how good a film is not to mention the fact that biological and historical evidence does not support this argument. Because of this reaction a very good fantasy adventure movie with a nice plot line, good acting, diverse cast (actually far more diverse than the upcoming BLACK PANTHER (which I don't mind the way it is anyway)) and interesting visuals bombed badly in the box office and the so called ""progressive"" media celebrated its demise.Well that is sad.Now lets get to the movie. The king of Egypt which happens to be the God Osiris is about to celebrate his Son Jamie Lannister's coronation day(wait what?) when King Leonidas comes along (Didn't see that happen!) and says something about being Set God of darkness and Kills Osiris and makes Jamie blind by removing his eyes (Jamie is the tree that keeps on giving, His hands, his eyes, what is next? his gold member? Get it? eh? eh? ugh, what am I doing with my life?) With Osiris dead and Egypt under the rule of cruel Spartan King and King slayer blind our film really starts. Our hero Bek is a faithless infidel even though he is seeing the gods basically everyday not like a certain some other God who shall not be named that is never around but yet commands worship... where was I? Oh yes, Bek has a wife named Zaya, Zaya unlike her faithless husband believes in Gods and that they can do good specially Horus (and for some reason everybody keeps calling Jamie Horus even though he clearly is Jamie. I wonder if this is a prank by Cersi played on Jamie) and believes that he will return to save the people of the land from Set's (King Leonidas, come on people!) tyranny. In an attempt to bring back Horus Zaya persuades her husband Bek that happens to be the Aladdin of the Egypt to steal the eyes of Horus back and bring them to him so that he can rise up and take back his throne. Needless to say Zaya dies and is sent to the land of the dead to face Lord Anubis. Bek in hope of saving Zaya takes her to Horus and makes a deal to help him get back his power and in return he would bring Zaya back. Oh while we are at it, Captain Barbaossa is sailing on his brand new space ship with his sun beam laser staff in earth's Exosphere and fights a giant space kraken, I hope it doesn't end up being a vital plot point down the line.So yeah, as you can see the story is packed with plot points that all connect together well. The movie uses CGI heavily and it is not done bad, it is a nice mix and does not put you off, all the gods have a transformed form that is completely cgi which could have been done better, but it is still very much watchable.The acting in this film is not anything that is Oscar level but is very pleasant and does not make you wonder why in hell you are watching this movie (ehm Ghost Busters 2k16 ehm) and the actors are endearing. There has been a lack of really good fantasy action adventure movie lately and God's of Egypt really delivers on that, it is just such a shame that it was not received well in the theaters. Here I am hoping for this film to achieve a cult hit status in the future"

This movie is in the same theme as Clash of Titans or many other Greek God themed action/ Sc-Fi movies. This however is based on the Egyptian Gods and is packed full of thrills, action with great special effects. The cast has some very big banes in it and as much as all the cast played their roles exceptional the main characters are a stand out with people like Ge3offery Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Elodie Yung and Gerard Butler to name just a few.This is a classic good Vs evil scenario with the Gods of Egypt under siege by the evil Set, but without the help of the mortals, then only can Egypt be taken out of the throes of the evil God Set.The screen jumps with magic, it is a movie with no slow parts, no gaps where you are not visually entertained. I think this movie is so go that if the writers, actors, directors etc where to do a prequel or a sequel, it would be also worth watching. This movie is worth watching if you like Sc-Fi. I don't know if every ancient God and Egypt that are portrayed are historically correct but it is not meant to be a documentary but a thrilling and exciting good Vs evil movie that packs a punch visually and with the actor's presence, Fantastic."

",0.0,-0.8805,2017-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I didn't like this movie. First off, this is a movie about Egyptian Gods. Notice the 'Egyptian'. I'm honestly not sure if there is any Egyptian actor except for an extra in this movie. Horus was played by a guy that could not look whiter if he tried, same with Bek.Then there's the matter with the story itself: Horus is sought out by Bek, who brings him one of his eyes back. On the way his girlfriend dies. He bargains with Horus to bring his girlfriend back and in return Horus gets his eye and he helps him find the other one. They then go on an 'epic' quest, with Horus belittling Bek at every turn. Their adventures are boring at best, laughable at worst. The only bright side is when we cut to Hathor (I think, the characters were kinda forgettable). She provides a few interesting moments. Once she meets up with our 'heroes' she joins them after saving their asses. Once they stop somewhere, she tells Bek that she can help him talk to his girlfriend and we see Bek's girlfriend. This plot line is equally as forgettable and boring as the primary one. THe girlfriend is just kinda there, not really doing anything, providing some motivation for Bek. After that we find out that Horus cannot actually bring the girlfriend back. This also kills any friendship between Horus and Bek. They were starting to like or at least respect each other. Hathor tells Bek that Horus lied and offers to give him her bracelet (apparently worth quite a lot) to give to his girlfriend so she can enter the Afterlife. THe bad guy, Seth (I think) decreed that only those with 'riches' can enter the Afterlife. Hathor's bracelet is more than a mere trinket since the bracelet is what keeps her safe from the demons she consorted with before Horus helped her (they were lovers). She takes it off and is taken by demons. Hathor's storyline is the only interesting thing about this entire movie, which is just sad. I would've liked to see it more developed, but what can you expect from a movie where Jaime Lannister plays Horus.Bek goes to visit his girlfriend and give her that bracelet. Then Seth or something is attacking the Afterlife. Again, the girlfriend fails to provide anything to the plot. I honestly don't remember another character as dull as her. Bek reenters the mortal world and they continue their 'epic' quest on the search for the eye. On the way they have to beat a sphinx (I forgot what for) and so they meet up with the god of wisdom. Horus 'manipulates' him so unsubtly I wanted to throw my phone at the TV. I know, the god of wisdom was supposed to be vain, but he does not deserve his title if he fell for that. They go to the Sphinx and the god of wisdom answers wrong. They nearly get killed. I was rooting for the sphinx. He answers the riddle right and they continue. Seth is currently meeting up with his wife/former wife. Then he cuts of her 'godly attributes' (wings). He does this with the other gods as well and melts their 'attributes' to himself. Then he goes to visit his father and kills him but he doesn't really kill him and it's all really confusing. Tbh, I was not rooting for Seth/his father/Horus/Bek, I was rooting for that demon slug his father (Horus' grandfather) had to fight every night. I was hoping it would demolish everything and no one would get out unscathed. They somehow manage to come back to the city and hatch some plan. They get help/threaten some wealthy guy into helping and while Horus climbs up the tower/(I think it's an obelisk?) Bek drives up the tower (inside) with the wealthy guy. The wealthy guy (surprise!) turns out to be a bad guy and tries to kill Bek. Bek survives and the wealthy guy doesn't (surprise.). Horus fights Seth and we discover he was actually capable of transforming into his godly form the whole time since his grandfather 'showed him how' but decided not to because he didn't believe his almighty grandfather. He defeats Seth and finds his other eye. Meanwhile, Bek has been injured and is dying. They try to make it seem like Horus and Bek have this ... 'epic bro-hood' and friendship, but it's flat and is not believable at all. Horus brings his fallen 'brother' to the pyramid where his girlfriend's already rotting and his grandfather visits him and the two corpses. He revives the two corpses. Happy End.The characters: Horus: Nothing Horus did seemed genuine. Horus looked constantly wasted or like he was coming down from a drug trip. Horus was not likable, he was an asshole even though he 'redeemed' himself, he was not likable. He had no charm, no interesting traits, nothing.Bek: Bek was made a lot worse by the actor. He seemed naive, forgave Horus for lying to him about his girlfriend and just generally being a asshole.The girlfriend: She was so forgettable that, I didn't remember her name. She added nothing to the story, had no real character. I don't think the movie would've lost anything if she hadn't been mentioned again after dying.Hathor: I think Hathor had the most well-developed character. You knew her motivations (staying alive, Horus) and she was badass in her own right without having to do actually fight.Seth: I'm not sure why he killed Horus' father. His motives didn't seem believable.The characters were not well developed, every character trait seemed exaggerated and sometimes they were too stupid to be taken seriously. Conclusion: I could've ignored the casting but the Characters kinda killed that attempt before it really started. I actually wanted to watch that movie in cinema and I'm so glad I didn't."

" Doesn't Deserve the Hate
",0.4585,0.9596,2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"The movie had so much potential. It was too short, and didn't give the different Gods a chance to shine. Some of them we only see for one two minute long scene. Both Horus and Set were cool and I enjoyed seeing them kick butt. It would have been nice to see A'Nubis in action(other than the one scene where he stops the beast from devouring the afterlife bridge) I don't mind CGI, and encourage it in 2017+ but we also need a good story that delivers. If they would have made a clear divide of forces and had war between the Gods WHILE Horus & Friends continued their quest; the movie would have been much better. I see how some people rate it extremely low, but I still had fun with it and give it a solid 8."
" Well, I gave it a go
",0.2732,0.9822,2017-04-12 00:00:00,2,"Once upon a time there was a director called Alex Proyas who made excellent films which really stuck with me and shaped my youth (think 'The Crow' and 'Dark City'). Even his later, and slightly less well-received, films like 'Knowing' and 'I Robot' were pretty damn good and are often re-watched in my DVD collection. Therefore, when I saw his name attached to 'Gods of Egypt' I naturally knew I'd be watching it. However, I didn't see it immediately and therefore became aware of the general consensus surrounding its appeal. In a nut-shell ‚Äì everyone hated it! Could this really be true? In short. Yes.I'll tell you now¬Ö this review is basically just going to be a list of things I hated in the film. Much of the critics' scorn came due to the alleged 'whitewashing' of roles which should really have gone to actors from/or around Egypt. Instead, we were treated to your pretty run-of-the-mill white actors playing characters who hailed from that area of the world. Whether that bugs you or not, it turned out to be the least of the film's sins! Right from the off we meet a good king. We know he's a GOOD king because he's clearly nice and his adoring crowd are all cheering from him. He also has a nice son. We know he's a NICE son because the crowd seem to love him, too. Oh, and he can change into a huge winged beast if he gets angry, but the general populous don't seem to hold that against him. However, mid ceremony, they get attacked by a baddie. We know he's a BADDIE because he's bad and starts killing people before demanding the nation bows down to worship him. Now, I know I'm using some pretty simplistic language, but that's just how the film is ‚Äì simple. These characters are possibly the most clich√©d, wafer-thin, cardboard cut-outs ever to grace modern cinema. The dialogue could be written by a child and it's practically laughable at how basic everything is for such a big budget production. And it doesn't end there. We later meet a young, idealistic hero. Then his love interest. Another baddie or so and yadder, yadder, yadder.And that's just the characters. Once our perfectly-formed hero sets off on his quest to get his girl and kill the bad guy he embarks on a journey that looks like it was created on a Playstation 2. Yes, I know you'd have to use a certain amount of computer-generated effects when dealing with mythical beasts whacking each other on the steps of the pyramids, but this really looks low-budget.Basically, Alex Proyas' directing skills don't go anywhere near to saving this disaster of a film. Okay, I may be being too harsh. I am a fully-grown adult who has been watching films for many years and has pretty much seen it all. Gods of Egypt may have its place for young boys under ten who haven't seen a mythical action film before. Yes, it would probably appeal to them ‚Äì until they see Indiana Jones or something like that. For everyone else - avoid."
" Above Average but good story line
",0.5927,0.9281,2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"The reviews really made me think twice about watching this but the script and special effects were not that bad. Didn't pay for it and would have possibly been more critical if I did. But as I didn't, I definitely give it a worth watching on DVD.CGI/special affects definitely should have been better but script and acting made it acceptable. Even had decent romance and quality morals to the story."
" Another reasonable film attacked by critics
",-0.6369,0.9932,2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I am beginning to despair of critics blasting a film for no objective reason.This is a great mindless romp. Hardly taxing the boundaries sudden plot surprises, but for young teens and adults who don't mind connecting with epic fantasies, a great few hours. The CGI is good, if not outstanding, along with the plot and the acting. The actors and actresses look the part and often look gorgeous. Part of the depth of criticism, I believe, comes from looking at this film from a very adult view point, set your mind to ""teen"" mode and enjoy it without the critical cynical viewpoint of a jaded OAP. Break out the popcorn, beer, wine, and enjoy a film. I think we have all forgotten the joy of watching films like this where there is little darkness and evil, except for the baddies, good will triumph, and along the way there will be simple messages of humanity and kindness. Please don't stop watching and making films like this, we need some simple pleasures and happiness in our lives."
" Absolutely awful
",-0.5095,-0.223,2017-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Horrible movie. Did the writers even bother to open a book about Egyptian mythology, throwing in some random Egyptian gods' names does not make it about Egypt and completely undermines the rich vibrant Egyptian myths. Moreover, the set, the costumes and the actors do not give any kind of Egyptian characteristics to the movie, how is it any different from any Roman setting or any other ancient setting, it might as well have been called Gods of Mars. They did not even try to make the actors look remotely Egyptian-ish, it reminded me of the time John Wayne played Jenkis Khan. I found the movie utterly ridiculous and boring, just another excuse for Hollywood to flex their CGI muscles."
" Overblown CGI spectacle masquerading as a proper movie
",0.0,0.9481,2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Gods of Egypt is another example of overblown CGI spectacle masquerading as a proper movie. I appreciate the intent and have enjoyed many of the previous films in the career of director Alex Proyas, even his last one, KNOWING, which divided audiences somewhat. However, Gods of Egypt is a step too far, and contains very little actual content amid all of the endless CGI.It starts off well enough, that's for sure, with some good shocking scenes and impressive transformations at the outset. The CGI is pretty good, but there's so much of it that the viewer is quickly overwhelmed and in the end bored by it all. I call it the George Lucas effect after his interminable STAR WARS prequels. Characters turn into CGI, some characters ARE CGI, the action is CGI augmented, and the landscapes are CGI. Me, I prefer the good old-fashioned elements of film-making that seem to be in short supply in Hollywood these days.On the plus side, this film boasts a solid leading turn from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, bringing plenty of his GAME OF THRONES charisma to the part. He gets to wisecrack a lot and he looks great, which is enough for me. Gerard Butler is all bombast as the villain of the piece who feels like an evil version of his King Leonidas. Some familiar faces round out the cast, like Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, but the unwise choice was to make the main actor a bland former HOME AND AWAY star and, yes, he's really wooden, a big hole right in the centre foreground of the movie. Elsewhere, some of the spectacle is quite impressive, and I appreciate little touches like having the gods much larger than their mortal counterparts (a CGI effect first utilised in Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS to depict the hobbits). A shame, then, that the majority of this movie is little more than instantly forgettable."
" It's not as terrible as I thought it would be
",0.3724,0.9865,2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"In the past, the whitewashing occurred because of the times. But what's the excuse today? Hollywood shouts for diversity. Yet they themselves don't cast for it. Maybe they wanted ""name"" actors such as Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau(of Game of Thrones fame) to sell it better. Thing is, how are blacks, browns, Asians, etc, suppose to get a ""name"" themselves if they aren't given the opportunity in the first place? I definitely can see the outrage over this movie's casting.The movie itself, you can't take seriously. It's campy action adventure fantasy. Think The Mummy movies and The Scorpion King. It's that kind of story, with similar type lines, dialogue, action-adventure scenarios, and comedy. It was actually fun and entertaining in that same type of way. Gerard Butler hammed it up. Bek(Brenton Thwaites) and Horus(Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) had great camaraderie. The CGI was pretty good at times, other times not that great.I had mixed feelings, enjoying the movie as mindless entertainment, yet disappointed by the whitewash. Anyway I gave it a 6/10."

It will never be confused with a movie that changes either yourself or tries to develop our society by asking the hard questions. But it is a movie that, if you are into the genre, will leave you thoroughly entertained. And that is something to approve of, not to look down upon.Set in the mythical Egypt, the god Set usurps the crown of Egypt from his nephew Osiris. On a quest for power, Set hunts down anyone who stand against him, mortal or god alike. Only Bek, a carefree thief who tries to save his beloved Zaya, dares to challenge the authority of Set. But he needs help, and together with the ""fallen"" Horus, they embark on an epic journey.The story is not much to talk about. A classic fight between good and evil, between brothers and a fight for supremacy. It is ripe with adventure and action. It is the basis needed of movie with the aim to entertain through action. And action there is a lot, both in the form of dueling, fighting and negotiating perilous mazes and monsters. It is also lightened up with a tongue in cheek flair, mostly through the character Bek, that give the movie quite a few humorous moments. The visual aspect should not be neglected. It is colorful and uses CGI quite heavily, but it works well set in the mythical world. I think most of it was done very well.The cast, with quite a lot of known names in it (notably Butler, Coaster-Waldau and Rush) and a few new ones that might be well known further on. This movie will not be the one that bring them prizes, but they perform well within the story, and give their character's traits credibility.

Or a Thor rip-off where Butler feels he deserves the honors in a similar fashion? An incoherent script and generic visuals ruined this predictable movie. The heroine was the saving grace of the film, and my friend is saying you ruined my weekend. The story amounts to a celebration of brute force in a crudely etched law-and- order context.The visual effects are actually a reason not to see this movie. They're very, very, very bad. We're talking of 3d gaming cut scenes bad. And it's edited poorly. Pointless nowadays! No wonder it flopped in the USA!"

I think the writers were drunk or something when they composed this ''masterpiece''. So you thing that the big stars would 'save' some of the movie but NO. In the whole movie their acting is below the average + their useless ''humor'' adds nothing to the childish scenario. I really hope that you didn't spend any money to the theaters to see it.

But it deserves a second glance. This film is in the grand tradition of the famous 1940s fantasy films like THIEF OF BAGDAD 1940 (recommended!).These films are neither as logical as a STAR TREK saga nor as linear as an Indiana Jones adventure. By nature, they tend to jump around, they tend to be a bit wacky, and they often encourage outlandish performances from their stars.Which is what we have here. The #1 A-List name star, Gerard Butler has arguably never been more unrestrained in his career. He gives the impression that, after he takes over the world of the living and the world of the dead, his next target is Hollywood itself.In fact, the lesser known stars give the better textured performances and connect with the audience.Give it a chance -- as a love story that riffs off some extremely misunderstood Egyptian myths and succeeds in spite of itself, it works a treat."
" I was told this would suck...

So I did, and I was pleasantly surprised. First of all: YES THE EGYPTIANS IN THIS MOVIE ARE MOSTLY WHITE. Some of them are also about 12 feet tall and can transform into flying robots. If historical accuracy is what you're looking for, this is not the movie for you, but I don't feel that this detracts from the story or the characters or the amazing visuals and had no effect on my overall enjoyment of the film. I've heard people complain about how its not original or the plot sucks or the script sucks, and maybe this is only because I went in with such low expectations, but I actually found the story pleasant and enjoyable (albeit not very complicated, but that's not necessarily bad), and some of the lines were legitimately funny. Not to mention this is one of those rare movies that isn't based off a book or is a sequel/remake (not that those are necessarily bad either), so the originality argument doesn't make that much sense either. Now, obviously it wasn't a fantastic movie - it was pretty heavy with clich√©s, some of the dialogue did fall flat, a few deus ex machina moments, and the CGI didn't always hold up - but for what it Set out to do (be a fun, action packed, cool-looking movie to not think very hard about) it did a good job. Better than it needed to in fact, because I usually can't stand the main characters in those types of movies but Horus and that mortal guy were actually pretty likable. If you were expecting some sort of documentary about Egyptian mythology, stay away from this, and don't bring down its rating with unfair reviews based on your unreasonable expectations."

And there is a lot of that to be had.Just dive into this movie and watch it free of all, if you can. Because this is how this wants to be watched. And if you can do that, then you are in for a very fun and entertaining ride. Most of it doesn't make sense and it's more or less one sequence paired with another, but tries to encapsulate the Harryhausen feeling. And in some regards I'd say it did.

It's by no means perfect, and some times the acting comes off as cringe-worthy, but the overall movie is well worth watching, and might just bring a tear or two to your eyes if you're not careful.This is the kind of film that can be safely enjoyed in any company, although the angstiest of teenagers might get uncomfortable with all the emotions, both joyful and sad, this movie takes you through.

As the film went on the alleged 'banter' between the Protagonist and Horus became more and more cringe worthy and oh so obvious. This tried desperately hard to have a certain whimsical humour to it and it failed miserably. The script was embarrassing, some of the performances equally so, the CGI was pathetic and in scenes where the characters were 'running' it was sadly all too obvious they were not in fact running but merely hitting a treadmill while the geniuses worked the CGI behind and around them. An overly expensive piece of Film making which really shouldn't have even been given clearance from the Studio.

" Sadly watching this is not a godly experience
",-0.4215,0.9899,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"""Gods of Egypt"" is a co-production between the United States, Australia, China and Hong Kong that resulted in this English-language movie. It runs for slightly over two hours and was written by Sazama and Sharpless, a duo also in charge of ""Dracula Untold"" and ""The Last Witch Hunter"". The director is (fittingly Egypt-born) Alex Proyas who has been making movies for over 35 years. So it is probably a bit disappointing how weak this one turned out. But if you read about actor George Butler (co-)starring in a film about ancient Gods, you basically know what to expect, even if he plays the main antagonist here. ""300"" was already a pretty mediocre (at best) film and so is this one we have here. The two good guy protagonists are played by Brenton Thwaites and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.The title already states what you can expect here. It's a film in which Egyptian Gods clash about who is the real King of Cairo. It is very generic in terms of who is good and who is bad and it is all very predictable. The worst, however, may be the love story involving Courtney Eaton (""Mad Max"") as it all feels so negligible and there is not really a single point where you hope for the couple to stay together, apart from knowing they will be united in the end anyway. This also has to do with Thwaites' pretty bad performance. Of course, Butler and NCW are not exactly revelations either, but they somehow do what needs to be done and use their experience occasionally in order to elevate the truly weak material. But Thwaites does the exact opposite.Now looking at the technical aspects here, this film actually scored some awards recognition with regard to these and it describes pretty much perfectly what this film is about in terms of quality. As much as it lacks in the story department, it is pretty solid visually, but of course not great either. A final notion to actor Geoffrey Rush, Oscar winner and a personal favorite of mine: He is Australian and this may have a lot to do with him appearing in here, but he has almost nothing to work with to show us his talent and is just as forgettable as the rest despite playing a somewhat important character. Overall, absolutely nothing is really memorable about these two hours and at times it felt just like a collection of special effects. Very disappointing and I hope they do not decide at some point to produce a sequel for this relatively weak movie as the first film was already so bad at times that you cannot really justify its existence. Watch something else instead."
" Ancient Egypt? No, not even close.
",-0.296,0.2617,2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"It has great special effects and costumes. The premise of gods fighting in Egypt instead of Atlantis or Greece which we usually get, is clever. Too bad the creators forgot they were in Ancient Egypt. Yes, Egypt was occupied by the French and the Greeks at one point, but the movie takes place prior to that, and hmmm, it has 1 black character in it? Egypt has always been and is still on the continent of Africa, which means you need to have Africans in the movie. Every culture depicts their gods in their image, and neither of the gods were African nor did either of them have any of the 200+ African accents. In this day and age when the average 6th grader knows the story of Egypt; the mysterious pyramids, hieroglyphs, supernatural and spiritual rituals, the sphinx, pharaohs and cunning queens, it is grossly negligent to disregard major historical cultural aspects when producing something this wide reaching. Too bad, it could have been the start of a new trend in blockbuster action films of the ancient eras."
" A nice way to pass the time
",0.4215,0.9869,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I watched this on a tiny LCD screen on an interstate flight between Perth and Brisbane - probably not the best way to enjoy it. There weren't any other inflight films that interested me and I saw the director was Alex Proyas, so that even if it was a terrible film, it would at least have stunning visuals.The story is more Hollywood than Egyptian, one we've seen countless times before in films like The Karate Kid and Rocky III. The hero, the god Horus, gets his ass kicked and family slain by villain Set. He must then go on a quest to get his mojo back (assisted by a plucky sidekick), defeat the villain and get the girl back. Nothing wrong with that, it's a winning formula.The cast is certainly interesting. There is a generous helping of Australian talent including Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, both playing Egyptian Gods! I didn't have a problem with most of the Egyptian characters being white and speaking in English accents. This is quite normal in Hollywood sword and sandal epics. I thought Brenton Thwaites was too pretty to play the part of Horus's human sidekick, he is almost godlike in appearance. They needed to cast someone with a scruffy street urchin look for the role. Elodie Yung is a standout as the goddess Hathor. She oozes languid sensuality and is able to be both slutty seductress and faithful partner without any contradiction.This film has copped a bit of flak for its CGI. I think it actually uses it well. CGI is best used to conjure supernatural worlds and fantastic beasts, not for explosions and car chases. I thought it was also clever how the gods had gold flowing through their veins instead of blood. This allowed the film makers to depict all sorts of stabbings, decapitations and eye gougings without showing any blood. Certainly, a good way to keep the all important PG rating.All in all, Gods of Egypt turned out to be a nice way to pass the time on my flight. I can't ask for more than that."

The script sounds as if it was written for a high school drama class (by one of the students), and some of the actors (Thoth) appear equally qualified.You can tell the producers are big believers in effects, as you could probably count on one hand the number of scenes that weren't green screen or cgi. As is usually the case with this type of production, the effects became the story rather than serving to help tell a story.George Clooney keeps a poster of his Batman movie up in his house as a cautionary tale to what can happen when you pick bad scripts. I can only imagine the leads in this film, all accomplished and capable actors, have a ""Gods of Egypt"" poster similarly hanging in their home offices.If you never watch this movie, you've missed nothing."
