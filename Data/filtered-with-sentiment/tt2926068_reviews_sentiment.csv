" Gem of a movie
",0.0,0.9387,2018-09-29 00:00:00,10,"I always prefer to watch movies made outside India and I have watched tons of movies. Most of the good films made in India are very much inspired/copied from foreign language films. Though Manam seems to be very loosely inspired (may be just the basic premise) from ""back to the future"", Manam is a far better movie than that. In fact Manam is one of the greatest movies ever made in world cinema (it is in my top 5).
PS: This is just my perception."
" Worth the watch.
",0.2263,0.9834,2018-06-18 00:00:00,8,"Interesting plot with unforgettable characters and beautiful music. Direction and Cinematography is pure bliss to watch with stunning frames and beautiful visuals. Only downside of the film, Naga Chaitanya's acting could improve slightly as it falls behind other prominent stars like ANR garu,Nag garu and Samantha who definitely wowed the audience effortlessly. Worth the watch!"
" Classic Telugu movie after decades
",0.0,0.9565,2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"This is a classic feel good Telugu movie after decades of commercial potboilers. The Director Vikram Kumar did a fabulous job weaving the multiple stories into the plot without spoiling the flow of the film.The music syncs the narrative further elevating the mood of the film. The performances are good. This film will be remembered as a farewell to veteran actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao.A feel good film with engaging scenes. Overall, it's love in abundance."
" Celebration of love and mountains of emotions.
",0.6369,0.9905,2018-02-15 00:00:00,10,"A cult classic film which is going to be remembered for a long time.
One of the best film I have ever seen. Every scene in the movie is brilliant, screen play is the best part of the movie. BGM and songs takes every scene to another level. Scenes between nagarjuna and samantha are treat for eyes. Love story between nagarjuna and shreya is a gem and perfectly handled. SHreya killed her role with her brilliant performce. I was just smiling throught the movie like a idiot enjoying every frame of the film. Manam- A masterpiece at its best."
