" Unwavering courage
",0.4939,0.9856,2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Truly a film of its times, even ten years ago nothing of this kind would have been likely. Candidly centred around the gorgeously goofy Minnie (Bel Powly), who is miraculously several steps ahead of the supposedly woke adults around her. Creative, curious and courageous, seemingly fearless, Minnie the ""harlot in the making"" is a miraculous invention yet surprisingly realistic and ""relatable"", to use a going term. Reading reviews in order of date (February 2021), the first in line stated ""disappointment"" and ""horror"" at discovering the sexuality of teenagers, and giving the film 1 star: significantly, this person never even watched the movie, which says it all: you can write a review of a book you never read, a film you never saw. And the litany of woes continues in chronological order. Fortunately, others recognise that the story and execution shows the unwavering courage and of Heller and her actors, and their faith in her project, which flies in the face of today's trends and clichés. Heller continues to climb, thank heavens."
" Glorifies Sexual Abuse
",-0.25,-0.3156,2020-09-28 00:00:00,1,"I'm disappointed in myself that I even sat down to watch this after reading what it was about. It took me about two minutes to realize how horrified I was and turn it off. This movie shows how messed up our society's ideas about sexuality are. There is nothing sexy about an adult having sex with a minor. It is very normal for teenage girls to be curious about their sexuality but not normal, or at all acceptable, for an adult to act that act that out with her."
" Underrated movie
",0.0,0.986,2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie thinking it's going to be a comedy for some reason, but was pleasantly surprised. It takes on so many different topics that are crucial to be aware of in today's society in my opinion.
Spoilers**
Minnie is a teenage girl that is exploring who she is and who she wants to be in a world where her parents are divorced (her dad manipulating her mom in order for him to be closer to Minnie) and her mom being a ""feminist"" in the 70's when she clearly needs someone in her life to make her happy, and here comes the boyfriend in the picture, Monroe. He is clearly a child in a man's body and happens to catch Minnie's attention because he's the first to show interest to her body.
I found the ending powerful, as Minnie finds that she doesn't need anyone but herself to be content, her relationship with her is mended, and she took the power back when she said goodbye to Monroe with the handshake her dad taught her to do.
Absolutely loved it!"
" An unpleasant experience with no paid-off at all.
",-0.6486,-0.9969,2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,"I'm not sure how to even start with this one. First let me say I'm baffled with the ratings. 6.9/10? 87/100 in Metascore? No, no, no. They couldn't be more wrong this time. This movie is... undescribably bad.Ok, so the movie is about pedophilia... is it really? I'm not sure. If you think you will watch a shocking, perturbing movie about pedophilia, let me say to you right now that you won't get satisfied. And no, this movie doesn't glorify pedophilia, nor condemns it. The movie uses it like a controversial tool, just to pretend being trangresive and edgy at the same time. Pedophilia is seen here as a subset of sex, that's it. It's just part of this teenage girl sex life. And look, I have to admit, in the beginning it was a little bit shocking. But as the movie went forward, you will feel more and more insulted, asking ""What is the point""? Wait, what is this?""And boy, let's talk about the girl. Nothing to talk really. This girl has two personality traits: being horny and being melodramatic. NOTHING ELSE guys. 1 h 40 min with this annoying, bland, teenage girl. She is horny. She wants it. That's it. ""Wow, that sounds like a honest, realistic portrayal of a teenage girl, it might be interesting"", you may think. Oh no, no, no. Reject that idea right off. Nothing is interesting here. It's not like Trainspotting, nor Christine F. It doesn't explore the stuff the characters go through, nor fleshes them out in any way, like Kids (1995). The plot doesn't drive them along because there's absolutely 0 script. And no, I didn't read the graphic novel this thing is based on, but for what I've heard it looks like this is a very free adaptation. It doesn't surprise me one iota.Oh and I forgot, the girl suposedly has an interest in drawing, but the movie is so bad at developing characters, I mean, so bad, that this plot point is completely brushed off of the movie, to the point it looks like an afterthought. And you know why? Because this movie has a love for pointless, exploitative scenes. All the scenes can be summed up in: sex scene, drug scene, pedo scene, drug scene, oh! let's pretend for a moment this girl is having some internal struggle, nevermind another pedo scene again! That's this movie. What's the point? Besides, the sequences go nowhere: there is no tension, no build up, no continuity, like a freak show, but hey! It's the 70s, and a 15 year old girl has an affair with her 35 year old stepfather, so I guess we can pull some controversy out of it...My theory is that this movie wants to be American Pie (besides the pedophilia), but doesn't have the courage to admit it and going all the way. The point is, American Pie tries to be funny, tries to make something out of some idiotic teenage people, tries to have some situation jokes, tries something. And this movie doesn't. It tries to be intelligent, and like ""honest"", but fails miserably in every possible way. Guys, I'm serious here. There's nothing good about this movie, except maybe the acting, which is average at best.The ""resolution"" of the movie, if you can call it that, it's like some douche trying to make black humor to be transgressive and controversial, but he just lands as insulting, pathetic and non sensical. I won't spoil it, because you know what? It also goes nowhere, so really nothing to spoil folks! Oh, and how could I ever forget? The girl has lesbian sex too. Why? Is she really bi? Is she experimenting? Nothing is developed or established, so who knows? Actually, I tell you why. Because the protagonist has to get laid with anybody, anytime. How else would we have a movie if not? It's like if I make a ""realistic"" movie about teenage boys and all the caracters do is smoking weed in the bedroom, with no continuity. You would say my movie is worthless, wouldn't you?In addition, the movie at times insert these quarky, out of place drawings pasted onto the frame, as if it wants to look cute, and it's the most obnoxious thing in the world.Overall, I just can't help it but to hate with vitriol these kind of movies. Movies that try sooo hard to be something more than exploitative, like ""realistic"" cinema, but fail miserably and end up being sexploitation with a big budget to hide it. Not only that, but watching this thing is an unpleasant, pointless, and dull experience. I mean, if you are gonna include pedophilia in your movie, do something valuable with it. 2/10."

" Fascinating, non-judgemental movie of a pretty screwed up life
",0.5423,0.9712,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"This movie follows a teenage girl's sexual awakening, which involves statutory rape, prostitution, drugs, and other things that weren't a part of my far more vanilla teenagehood. The main character, Minnie, is creative and bright but also has the delusional mind of a teenager and a bit more of the ""I'll try anything once"" attitude that might be good for her.The movie itself doesn't seem to judge anyone. Not the mother who does coke with her daughter or the boyfriend she seduces or Minnie herself. The life they lead seems appropriate for an appearance on the Jerry Springer Show, yet she never portrays them as mouth-breathing idiots but more as just reasonably decent people with dubious judgment. It's surprising, particularly at a time when the movie idea of the girl and the older man has moved from romantic to creepy, to see this straightforward portrayal.It's also cleverly filmed and includes some nice animated sequences. I'd definitely recommend it."

" Teenage Coming-of-Age Film for Adults Only
",0.0,0.9957,2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Minnie is a 15-year-old schoolgirl in the San Francisco of 1976. She is not particularly interested in her schoolwork, because her long-term ambition is to become a professional cartoonist. Her short-term ambition, however, is to have sex. With as many people as possible, regardless of gender, but in particular with her mother's handsome live-in boyfriend Monroe. Lovers of films about fifteen-year-old girls having sex will be delighted to learn that Minnie fulfils this ambition in spades. Besides the sex, she also dabbles in drugs.Those reviewers who described ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" as a touching coming-of-age story and praised the quality of the acting do not appear to have seen the same film as I did. It's more like softcore porn masquerading as a touching coming-of-age story. As for the acting, I could never for one minute accept Bel Powley as a fifteen-year-old girl. But then, I probably wasn't meant to. If this film had been made with an actual fifteen-year-old actress, the director would have gone to jail. Had it been made with a young-looking eighteen-year-old actress who could pass for fifteen, that might have satisfied the law's demands, but the result would still have been hugely controversial. So the solution was to make it with a twenty-three-year-old actress who in a good light could pass for twenty-two.It is, in fact, quite possible to make a good film about the relationship between an adult man and an underage girl- Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is a case in point. In that film, however, as in the novel by Vladimir Nabokov on which it is based, the relationship is portrayed as something exploitative and the man as predatory and lacking in moral judgement. Those misguided enough to believe that Nabokov sympathises with Humbert should think again; his relationship with Lolita ends disastrously not only for her but also for himself. In ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"", by contrast, the relationship between Minnie and Monroe is portrayed in a much more positive light, as an important if temporary stage in her sexual and emotional development. There is no sense that he is a predator or an exploiter in the same way as Humbert, and nobody seems particularly worried by the fact that he is cheating on Minnie's mother Charlotte. (The same Christian name, incidentally, as Lolita's mother? Was this done deliberately to suggest a link between the two films?)According to Wikipedia, the film was the subject of some controversy in the UK because of the decision of the BBFC to give it an '18' rating. Given the explicit sex scenes, I am not sure how they could have given it any other rating, but this of course meant that young people of fifteen, the same age as the film's heroine, were not permitted to see it. The great thing about coming-of-age dramas, whether in the cinema or in literature, is that they can appeal not only to adults but also to the age group about whom they were written. When I came of age in the seventies films like ""American Graffiti"" were part of my formative experiences, as were books like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and ""A Kind of Loving"". ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"", by contrast, is a coming-of-age film made for adults only. Which seems like a contradiction in terms. 4/10"
" Thanks for sharing
",0.6908,0.9567,2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I wish I could appreciate this as more than erotica. For me, it is very compelling and arousing to watch young, unconventionally attractive Minnie explore her own sexuality.I'm not saying I didn't feel a strong sense of pathos for her. The strong sense of place time where women are finally starting to sort of see themselves as people on a mass scale is apparent. With plenty of nuance and frankness about human sexuality, one could enjoy this simply for how much it waves the flag for how females actually do have libidos.it is also a well observed and sensitive depiction of an individual fluctuate from self-empowerment to profound vulnerability envisioned sensuously but with a certain cynicism always somewhere in the back ground.The intermittent use of animation gave the movie a certain dynamism that helped it feel fresh though the element of Minnie being an artist didn't really go anywhere to my mind.Don't deprive yourself of this. It's one of those features that works even if much of it goes over your head (like it did mine). Even if it doesn't always resonate and is often a bit alienating, it manages to fascinate in how it is at least very authentic or else fakes it very well."

" Brilliantly Acted, but still a coming of age girl shaming movie
",0.3612,0.69,2019-10-30 00:00:00,6,"I would give anything to see a movie about a girl coming of age without it becoming a cautionary tale that ultimately girl shames the heroine. While the story is interesting to a certain degree, I have to say it also depicts just how flaky the seventies were. From the mom to the dad to the boyfriend to the girl herself, all the characters are flaky drug addled or simply immature people who should not be given custody of a dog much lest a child. To praise this film as coming of age for girls is a slap in the face of girls who do finally come of age and are not in fact girl shamed by the people around her. I am not impressed by this film as a so called coming of age story. I am however impressed by the performances. Do not go into this movie thinking the girl is going to come out triumphant, owning her own sexuality. She doesn't. By the way, made me change the language because I used the term sl&t shaming, so I subbed it with girl shaming."
" Heavy blows
",0.0,0.9593,2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"The film is pretty heavy ...
That's the author talking about the book that launched the film. She's got a pretty jolting wide-eyed look as does this film.I'm probably too old (and too male) to overcome my own baggage watching this, the main character for all her swings between strength and vulnerability, as always a kid to me. A kid imperiled. Even though I can deal with enduring a film as opposed to enjoying one, this took some effort to stick with. That's likely a credit to the acting involved, and not just the young lead.And Bel Powley is neither a teenager nor American. Nor was she when the film was made.Anyways, plenty to appreciate in the film-making, and while the story may not exactly nail an epiphany (maybe people in such films/lives do best by steering clear of epiphanies), the fact that the character, and the behind-the-reel life author survive, is a success. And that's a spoiler I guess.For me, I often feel like kids in ""these days"" (2019 +/- five years) have a lot of adult stuff thrust on them in terms of thinking about career even before college, and in general grow up fast, even if mostly virtually. This film reminds me that this has been happening to kids forever (cue the documentary with the 10-year old leading a herd of goats to local pond and starting down elephants).In the film the play-fighting between Minnie and Monroe was many things, foreshadowing and foreplay but also foretelling. I think in a way Minnie at some level would have liked to have landed a heavy blow.And I wouldn't bet against Phoebe Gloeckner landing one."

" Let's talk about sex baby
",0.0,0.8368,2019-08-02 00:00:00,6,"The Diary of a Teenage Girl could easily be one of these kookie offbeat coming of age films. Instead It decides to be more daring and frank instead.Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley) is a 15 year old teenager who has sex with her bohemian mother's Charlotte (Kristen Wiig) boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard) and enjoys the experience. In fact she likes sex, wants more of it and experiments with her friend Kimmie as they both deals with their raging hormones.Minnie keep a diary on tape of her sexual exploits which is probably not wise when her mother becomes suspicious. The film uses cartoons to display some of Minnie's frank thoughts.Director Marielle Heller sets the film in San Francisco of 1976. The period is very evocative and is set during the trial of Patty Hearst which the characters comment on. It allows the film to get away from the fact that Monroe is breaking the law by sleeping with an undersage girl by protraying it as a different era back then.The film makes no moral judgment about an older guy having sex with a minor, although Monroe's relationship is in a non predatory way. It is probably more refreshing that a film about a teenage girl having sex avoids many of the usual tropes.It is a bravura performance by British actress Bel Powey but she is too old to play a 15 year old and looks it. I did find the film hollow somewhat but maybe this was something Minnie eventually released. Sex was fun but eventually it meant nothing."

" This was grand! and yet very confusing!
",0.338,0.9806,2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"What I really enjoyed from the film was, my favorite thing, was how they incorporated the protagonist's art into the storyline, that was really neat and pretty to see how they did it, and it worked, the lead role was really well done, the big credulous eyes so bright and open and ready to take on the world and who knows grab a big chunk for herself! Very cool...But life can never imitate art , not perfectly, for how can it, the artist draws or writes or indulges in their creative medium creating a microcosm of what is or what could be if and only if...But the world, and real life do not stop and ask and especially sympathize with our own little perspective no matter how thoughtful or endearing or mindful especially in a world where everyone is living life the best they can from their own myopic limited diminutive perspective and although gregarious or introspective we yet need to make connections and it in this reaching out for another that we come to them and ourselves one lil' quirky step at a time.In this tale I felt like the big word creeping underneath was displacement, as the characters would unfold their intent, which is our biological instinct to be heard and to be loved it is in the reciprocal that everything seems to go haywire. Each character has their factory settings on full blast as they sally out to make a special connection getting back exactly what they give for we can only receive data from the funnel that sifts and discerns from our own idiosyncratic intentions. The problem that is really highlighted here trying to connect with someone holding onto our own clandestine preconceived pretext that ruins any chance at a true connection, this is why you see all the characters using their best tools; you have one character charming and using deception, others more exacting and gauche using irrational blind illogical furry, others seeing the truth but yet lying to themselves affording self-deprecation and sef-deception and others just plain using the double edge sword of aimless sex at an attempt to feel anything in their cold bleak existence and everyone hoping for the best but how can this lead to anything but chaos? I mean even the lil' girl Grettle, trying to spy on her sister and when left in the lurch begging to know what is going on; I think this was just a raw and moving in your face meditation or rather a cold slap in the face awakening at what its like to really want something and yet finding endless even more confusing tangents unfurl form the warp and woof of our plight trying to connect as humans; especially when we desire the basic physical because it comes attached simultaneously with its very unique and intrinsic mental and spiritual whereupon both are quite unrelenting and importunate."

But ""Diary"" can't be accused of copying the other film as it is based on the biographical graphic novel by Phoebe Gloeckner. Each film has its own strength and uniqueness.There is much discomfort in the early sex scenes for obvious reasons. At least, Powley was an adult when the film was being made. But while the film clearly goes into taboo territory, it does so in a way that surprisingly comes off as moving rather than cheap and exploitative.The story is told through Minnie's (Gloeckner's) perspective so, as it turned out, there seem to be no belief in victims or predators. While there are consequences for the very unconventional liaison, there is no sense of melodramatic punishment that would be expected in other current stories.Director Marielle Heller does a great job in recreating the carefree attitude of San Francisco in the 1970s as she does in getting fine work from Powley and Skarsgard. The constant partying and indulgences in sex, booze, and drugs was simply the way of life back then and the lightness in attitude comes through in a way that is almost nostalgic. This attitude would crash later after the onset of AIDS, the Reagan years, and real estate speculation (the single-parent family lived in a big apartment in downtown San Francisco on a librarian's salary - something that couldn't happen today). There is also the enjoyable bonus of animated images that accompany Minnie's thoughts and reflections.This movie succeeds in taking a controversial subject and expressing it convincingly with heart. - dbamateurcritic"
" Well played, but so what?
",0.3071,0.9413,2018-05-11 00:00:00,7,"In 1970s San Francisco, Minnie is the 15 year old daughter of a loser mother, a would-be cartoonist, and beginning to explore her sexuality, which she chooses to do with her mother's equally loser boyfriend (and others).Based on a graphic novel, this film is well played by Kristen Wiig as the mother, and with a particularly courageous performance (by which, as usual, I mean featuring a lot of nudity and simulated sex) from English Bel Powley. It's not just courageous, it's a good performance.The problem, for me, was that the film didn't actually have much to say. OK, let's be controversial by making her 15 (Powley was 22 when making the film, but convinces as a sexually precocious 15-year old), but then they did nothing with that. It could have explored the issue of the age of consent: it didn't. Instead, the main plot dynamic was when and how drug-addled Mom would find out, and that wasn't really enough to sustain the movie.I quite liked the performances and the stylish direction, but I wanted more meat on the bones."
" Periode piece not without merit, but doomed by unlikable characters
",0.7223,0.7098,2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"In many ways a period piece, this indie film captures a very special time period in San Francisco, a time when counterculture flourished and withered, people experimented and abused all kinds of substances, and teen artist Minnie experiences a lot of firsts, in the eternal search for acceptance, love, and a sense of purpose.In spite of a brave, earnest, and raw performance by a deliberately exposed Bel Powley, very believable as a teenager in the aforementioned period, and of a subtle, nuanced and understatedly magnetic one by the great Alexander Skarsgård, this movie falls short because its characters are sadly just a bit too immature, selfish, and unlikable.While that sounds very much like the typical description of the stereotypical youth, it remains nonetheless a major fault in the script how unsympathetic Minnie is throughout, with no real point of self-reflection or regrets over some of her actions, refusing to deal with the consequences of even her more heinous ones.Surrounded by egotistical, likewise emotionally stunted, at times manipulative adults, it may be no wonder that the main character is unable to learn or grow much, but the level of navel-gazing is still a bit too grating, with the protagonist of this clearly autobiographical story experiencing life events without any sort of moral compass whatsoever.The film drags towards the end, perhaps because of the fragmented, increasingly hazy way the story is told as the movie progresses, but also because by then we care very little about the fate of the different characters. Though this intimate film does hit some high notes in terms of mood, acting, and cinematography, the end result is unsatisfying. (+) The reconstruction of 70's San Francisco is very well done. Some of the scenes really hit the point. Mood and color palette also well done.(-) Unsympathetic characters, starting with the amoral, self- centered protagonist, doom the movie."
" Dear Diary
",0.3818,0.9273,2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Desperate to lose her virginity, a high school student seduces her stepfather in this teen angst drama set during the 1970s. As the title indicates, our young protagonist diarises and reflects upon her experiences, including her gradual progression towards being a ""harlot"", as she terms it, seducing boys in her class when her stepfather tries to rebuff her later advances. The most striking aspect of the film is Bel Powley's lead performance; not only does the twenty-something actress credibly play a character two thirds of her actual age, she also handles her character's progression from vulnerable naivety to proactive spirit very well. There are also some magnificent animated sequences that capture her thoughts as she considers herself to be a cartoonist in the making. What works best about the film though is its avoidance in passing judgment on the characters. Neither Powley, nor Alexander Skarsgård as her stepdad, are vilified for their illicit affair; they are both painted as equally responsible and equally as manipulative in their own ways. The tension that drives the film nevertheless peters out towards the end, especially as Kristen Wiig (cast as Powley's mother) gets more screen time and the film hardly ends on a high note It is, however, a pretty dynamic ride for the most part with its two equally reprehensible and yet humanly flawed main characters."
" Mature, explicit ""coming-of-age"" story that rattles yet inspires
",0.6908,0.998,2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The title ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" sounds like it would entail a fairly tame iteration on a female coming-of-age story, yet Marielle Heller's debut as both writer and director happens to be the boldest coming-of-age indie ever made – and the most challenging.""Diary"" stars Bel Powley as Minnie, a 15-year-old aspiring cartoonist in 1970s San Francisco looking for an opportunity to lose her virginity. She does, and it comes in the form of her mother's (Kristen Wiig) boyfriend, Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard). As their illicit relationship becomes more and more involved and complicated, Minnie's relationship with her sexuality – and herself -- becomes equally so.There's no denying that it is difficult to overcome the moral issues of Minnie and Monroe's affair, and it requires of Heller a very sensitive touch and an iron-clad sense of purpose. She sugarcoats nothing for those with delicate sensibilities. There are a lot of sex scenes that by their very nature will make viewers uncomfortable, but Heller successfully avoids exploiting the character or veering off-message. She treats Minnie as an adult, and in her writing, it's clear that neither character is solely responsible or solely to blame for the relationship. The hardest thing to shake, as a viewer, is our tendency to be moral judges of Minnie's decisions and to hold notions of what the consequences should or will be for her actions. Switching gears and abandoning that approach to watching this story will be harder for some than others, but once it becomes clear that Heller's vision is completely judgment free, it becomes easier to embrace that aspect of the film.Naturally, the explicit nature ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" makes it instantly different than most coming-of-age movies. The usual archetypes associated with this sub-genre are much less ubiquitous, and the notion of a ""loss of innocence"" in the literary sense gets completely redefined here considering Minnie actively plays a role in it. The '70s time frame is a bit of a clue that this is not a movie intended for budding teenagers, rather for people who have already been through such formative, challenging experiences. Further evidence: the story comes from Phoebe Gloeckner's semi- autobiographical graphic novel of the same name.The maturity of the film, especially as it sees Minnie, requires a lot of Powley. She must be wide-eyed and optimistic, yet also advanced for her age and kind of devious. She must be sure of herself, yet unsure at various moments throughout the film. Powley (22 at the time of filming) is just old enough to get it down pat. As much as Minnie has flaws, we never come to despise her, and that credit belongs to the writing. There's a poetry to the diary narration in the film, but it's language that resonates. So much of what Minnie thinks and feels mirrors our own experiences (especially the insecurities), even if those experiences weren't as scandalous.Because we see the supporting characters from Minnie's perspective, they have to work harder to earn our empathy. It's virtually impossible for Skarsgard to earn it as Monroe, but he does convey that Monroe is a deeply lost, childlike soul. Wiig, on the other hand, does an impressive job in this non-traditional role for her as the mom, Charlotte. Charlotte does hard drugs with friends and says all the wrong things to her daughter, but her love for Minnie is apparent as are her other struggles. Her lack of affection and approval of Minnie undoubtedly has a hand in her desire to seek it through Monroe and others through sex.The animated graphic elements styled after the novel are excellent, if not underutilized. At the same time, adding this facet to the movie creates a slight bombardment of storytelling styles. You have the narration piece, the cartoon/animation piece and then the fact that this is a movie. It splinters the film's identity a bit, but all these media have something to offer the viewer in conveying Minnie's journey and experiences.Where Minnie arrives at the end of the movie is pretty satisfying and inspiring, even if you have to wonder whether a 15-year-old is really capable of arriving there. The story has a strong feminist message that people still struggle to learn, and has real-world value. It took some really uncomfortable, traumatic stuff for her to get there, but her self-discovery is more poignant than most of her indie coming-of-age peers.~Steven CThanks for reading!
