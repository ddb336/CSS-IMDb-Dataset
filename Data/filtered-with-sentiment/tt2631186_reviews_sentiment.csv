" Perfect in every sense
",0.5719,0.9857,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I learnt about this movie through memes and social media blogs. I didn't have a TV connection back then and I wasn't much into pop culture, so I didn't really know what this movie was about. I just saw that this movie had a lot of special effects and it used animators, so obviously it had to be good. I practically begged my parents to let me see this movie in the theatres. I hadn't been to the theatres for the last 7 years, and they finally gave me the permission to see this one. And I wasn't disappointed.This is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed to its fullest only in the theatres. Everything about it was superb - the CGI (considering the technology and experience of CGI in India is not very advanced), the acting, the music, the colour palette, the locations, the overall tone, everything is perfect. Watching Shiva climb the waterfalls, the battle scenes, Shiva alone pulling Bhallaldeva's statue, all of this looked great when being watched on a giant screen.The story finally ended on a cliffhanger for the second part, which is another movie for which I requested my parents to let me see, but that's for the other review. But it was an actual good cliffhanger, unlike the usual sequel baiters that we normally see in high budget action or superhero movies, or the money squeezing that happens when one movie becomes successful. This one actually meant it.This movie basically introduced me to South Indian cinema. Until then I was thinking all South Indian movies are the same, with unrealistic actions and cringy humour. But this one was different. Just by looking at it you know this one really means business. I hope in future we will get to see more such Indian movies that make us proud that we have a film industry that prioritises quality over quantity."

",0.0,0.9877,2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"This was the first Indian movie I watched from beginning to end, including the Conclusion, I am half Indian whom mostly saw Indian movies whenever my father or his siblings watched it. (I am half Indian/Australian), Bahubali was the first for me.It was an epic movie that I think should have gained global recongition in the western culture of movies, I have always tried to get others to watch it too. There were a few corny moments but it wasn't as bad. Ramya Krishnan and Anushka Shetty caught my attention the most, until this movie, I don't think I had seen an badass woman like them (The ones I saw partly of were all old movies). Prabhas was just as fanastic, I love the way his character had a boyish charm and curiosity in what he did.
Tamaanaah Bhatia was also fanastic, and Rana was good, I honestly don't have much to complain about, as Bhatia's character was a strong female lead much like Ramya/Anushka.I still listen to the songs on Youtube, especially Hamsa Naava as it is a good song."

" Indian Cinema Is Not Good
",-0.3412,0.7234,2020-09-14 00:00:00,3,I had so much fun throughout this movie because I kept laughing at the horrible Cgi and acting. The film is so cringey and the way the story is structured is so bad. The film thinks that it's a masterpiece and a new night for indian cinema. Honestly this movie is not good and I am going to say it but bollywood fans have a horrible taste in film. The only thing I liked was that a lot of fun tearing this film to shreds.

",0.0,0.8322,2020-06-03 00:00:00,7,"A Bollywood musical, Lord of the Rings type epic. I actually really enjoyed this and I wasn't expecting to at all. I think the medium score (7) is mostly due to the language barrier and probably the musical element which I felt didn't really go with the style of film.The CGI scenery was very well done and you could almost believe that it was a magic kingdom somewhere a long time ago, but it was a bit distracting when a little cgi popped up in the corner to let you know that no animals were being harmed, especially as there was already a disclaimer at the beginning.I did get a little bit confused regarding his parentage, which I don't think was helped by the chronology of the film. For me Baahubali's fathers story should have been told at the beginning and a bit more clearly.The whole film is visually stunning and the story is very interesting. I hope I enjoy the second one as much."

" Epic Fantasy Done Right
",0.0,0.976,2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,This movie is truly epic as the genre which it portrays. The story draws inspiration from Mahabharata mainly the evil cousin/ Prince dynamic. The battle of Good Vs Evil and so on. However this movie excels in its imagination and free flow of ideas. The visual effects are really well done and don't look too cartoonish. Prabhas is truly a star and carries the movie with his solid performance. There are a few strong female leads mainly the Queen mother portrayed by Ramya. A really enjoyable movie with plenty of rewatch value. Dare I say it's the Bollywood version of Lord of The Rings in its imagination and creativity. We need more of movies like this one.
" Spectacular!
",0.0,0.9786,2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Wow, what an incredible film! This looks amazing on screen! The film boasts stunning photography. The visual effects are for the most part fantastic (some scenes are clearly blue screen). The action sequences are jaw-dropping, and the stunts amazing. (I enjoyed the fact the score wasn't so annoyingly overbearing as in the Hollywood movies).For a film almost 3 hours long, lit's astonishing that there never is a boring moment. This is intrigue, action and adventure from beginning to end. The final act is nothing short of spectacular, with a sensational 40-minute long battle sequence! The camerawork and visual effects during this particular scene is mind-boggling. This is probably as much of a spectacle today as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Cleopatra' was back in the day."
" Fantastic Movie

Why this Movie has got so many negative reviews is beyond me because it definitely doesn't deserve them. If you're a fan of cinema give this a go I don't think you will be disappointed.
" Visually Stunning, lacking in story
",0.3818,-0.1224,2020-02-28 00:00:00,6,"The movie is visually beautiful. The fight scenes are interesting. The costumes, the defense system etc is very well done. It's obvious that a lot of cost & effort was put into this movie. However, I found the story to be boring, uninteresting and even confusing. It has been done way to many times in movies where a mother awaits his son to take revenge from a cruel ruler. The character of Sivagami (played by the actress Ramya Krishnan) is unbelieble and unrealistic. I'm not sure how much of this movie is based on history but it sure doesn't tell the story in an interesting way in my opinion."

Prabhas has done a good job in playing this role, excellent. Baahubali's character is charming, and since it combined a certain large part of religion, war and politics, i'd like to rate it for 8.5-8.9, a very good movie"
" Must watch Epic fantasy from India
",0.0,0.9827,2020-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The most epic recent Indian cinema told in 2 movies, centers on a mythical figure, facing is heroic destiny.First word I would use would be Titanic, in the first sense, as everything is here to make us feel so little, beneath all of this grandeur. All of it is pretty much working as you wonder in its universe on the rhythm of India and of course it's Bollywood singing.Plot is not extraordinary in this first movie, but can be intriguing given the storyline mix-up, the various characters and their ambiguity (very little though).Despite some technical issues and what appears to me, as Asian having no interest in realism for these movies, the whole movie can be of beauty on many scenes.Of course, it is as clever or dumb as any usual superhero blockbuster.To sum up it is a pretty pleasing laid back movie, with lot to offer, from its world, to the glorious epic scenes, and more to come in the following filmOf course, my review is tainted by my occidental self."

" Interesting piece of epic
",0.4019,0.9784,2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Great visuals. Great story. Great characters. Great fights. Great effects, but actually no! I am not in very close relations with Bollywood but i really enjoy this film. It hook me and don't let until the end. Sure i'am still not very familiar with all those hyberbolize, unrealistic moments but it was okay. Maybe it's thing of culture style or something i can't understant at this moment of my life. One and only thing from negative perspective is effects. I can't get how people say it was on Lord of the ring level... 60-75% of visual effect in film was great and was in competition with holywood, but those 40-25% was terrible... It was like student level... I'am not sure how film with this kind of budget and with battle scenes like this (hell! it was really epic) have some trashy green screen, unrealistic cgi moments... It's like film run over budget and finnish some scenes with budget. But totally worth to watch!"
" A VISUAL SPECTACLE ! A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
",0.7604,0.9897,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Most of India identify him as the maker of the 2012 sleeper hit Makkhi (aka Eega/Naan EE/Eecha) as well as the reincarnation saga, Magadheera (Maaveeran in Tamil). However, in the annals of Tollywood, S.S. Rajamouli, is better recognized as the serial blockbuster maker with a Midas touch. Even his lesser known earlier movies have spawn successful remakes/dubbed versions in multiple Indian languages. Seen thus, he is among the few regional film makers who can rightfully claim of winning adulation and appreciation across the country.
Baahubali, Rajamouli's ambitious magnum opus, to be presented in two parts - The Beginning released now to be followed by The Conclusion next year - owes much of its existence to the critical and commercial success of Makkhi (2012) where Rajamouli proved that he could weave a riveting revenge saga with a humble housefly as the protagonist. One can also say that Baahubali as well as Rajamouli's dream took flight with the tender wings of that housefly which could establish him as a maker who could assure delivering the goods on a much larger scale and reach.Set in a fictional medieval land, Baahubali - The Beginning is a revenge saga of a royal family where the long lost prince - Shivu (Prabhas) - would be seen avenging the injustices of a cruel and corrupt king - Ballala Deva (Rana Daggubati) who murdered his father - king Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) and imprisoned his mother - Devasena (Anushka Shetty goes completely de-glam). While the story is as old as humanity itself, it is in his presentation that Rajamouli scores his aces. Without doubt the design and execution of the movie is on a scale hitherto unseen in Indian cinema. The movie boasts of state of the art CGI which could rival most of what is on offer from Hollywood which is seamlessly complemented by gorgeous art design of the ever-dependable Sabu Cyril which is captured by K.K. Senthil Kumar to spellbinding effect. While the songs themselves are quite unremarkable, music director M.M. Keeravani (aka Maragadhamani) has amped up the intensity of the action set pieces with an energetic score. The extended action set piece of the battle which forms the finale has been spectacularly conceived and rendered by Peter Hein and his team. In fact, the visionary director, his visual effects team, Sabu Cyril and K.K. Senthil Kumar as well as the audacious producer who believed in the director and his team to deliver the wares are the real stars of this movie. Speaking of the star cast, Prabhas and Rana bring on an intense screen presence with their hulking herculean builds even as veteran Ramya Krishna matches them with her fiery presence. Satyaraj (as Kattappa) and Nasser (as Pingala Deva) excel in their minor cameos.
S.S. Rajamouli has the rare twin gifts of being a visual artist and an entertaining storyteller. In Baahubali - The Beginning, he has let the visual artist to overshadow the storyteller in him. Baahubali has several instances where Rajamouli doffs his hat - without copying, per se - to Hollywood masters like James Cameron, Peter Jackson as well as local influences like the epics of Ramayana, Mahabaratha along with notable works in Bollywood and his own earlier works.If one were to count the failings of the movie, I would flag the lack of emotional connect with the story and its characters, especially coming from a maker who could hook us and root for the revenge saga of a humble housefly. The insipid romance between Prabhas and Tamannah is unconvincing and is the chief culprit resulting in the extra long first half which feels a tad of dragging. Nonetheless, the movie remains consistently engrossing as Rajamouli shifts the action from one verdant locale to another which rise up in majestic CGI visuals which are well crafted with the exception of few blemishes which look phony.Baahubali - The Beginning heralds the breach of the long held and accepted horizons of Indian film-makers and explores brave new visual vistas where contemporary Hollywood has held reign for a decade or more. Now, if only our film makers build more muscle in the storytelling side too, our films would be celebrated across the world, besides India. But, till then, Rajamouli and his team richly deserve the shower of praises that are to come their way for imagining and executing an epic entertainer that has taken Indian cinema to an all new apex. Hope he scales greater heights and concludes his epic saga with a fitting finale. I AM WAITING !!"

The main character can do anything like fighting 1000s of soldiers with a sword, hold a 1000 kg idol with just a rope, jump from mountains and catch a falling guy. Too many unrealistic scenes. Story line is very weak. Vfx looks OK nothing great. All characters having fake and funny beards. Just an overrated movie."

And I say this movie is pretty average. I really appreciate the efforts they put in for making this mammoth. I think this movie paved way for such big budget movies to be made in future.
1. The story - Could the story get any more cliche? They could refine the story. There are better stories out there like ""Aayirathil Oruvan "" which could be great movie with refined script. I would say with same budget as Bahubali it would have been a brilliant movie.2. I don't understand why there is an item song in period movie. Even if they wanted to have it should feel appropriate.

Mostly the movie looks very good, and different. Considering the budget is 20m$ and most western epic films have over 100-200m$ It looks very good. And it has this dreamy fairy tale magic to it which is really cool. Like when he climbs up the huge waterfall chasing the dancing beauty to find a whole new world. So good <3Some of the editing is a bit weird, but it can also be cute and funny. I feel like there is a lot happening and the movie goes forward very fast, which is cool, even tho they have all this slow mo scenes and the musical numbers.
My favorite scene is the undressing of Avanthika when she tries to fight Bahubali, that was so surprising and sexy in a really cool way. Also the big battle has some very cool moments. Some scenes here reminds me of 300 and Hero."

Watching it, one has some idea of what it must have been like to see a Cecil B DeMille film for the first time. The award-winning VFX draw you into the myth of the story. And 'myth' is the key word, if you're a westerner watching it. To really benefit from this film you need to let yourself enter into the mindset of mythology. It requires that particular kind of suspension of disbelief that was needed to appreciate Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, for instance, where ninjas can defy the laws of gravity.
And this is easily equal to Crouching Tiger, but on a grander scale and with added humour and Bollywood-style songs."

The opening scenes were so just ridiculous, I almost kept watching for amusement more than anything else. I didn't make it more than 5 minutes into the action before I evacuated. Sometimes, it's kind of like The Room meets 300.Edit: even though I turned it off after 5 mins during my first screening, my kids and I began watching it on the following weekend just for the fun of it. It earnestly tries to be epic and serious but a lot of times the grossly obvious and gratuitous CGI kept us laughing.And what is with the slow-mo shampoo commercial headshaking of Bahubali every time he gets wet. Lol.Also, my daughters and I didn't like the fact that while the women in the movie are strong-willed and talented it's made clear that they are ultimately wild, over-emotional creatures who need taming and can only progress so far in their quest; ultimately men are their masters. Very outdated and disappointing!Nonetheless the film is so endearingly sincere in its intentions it's hard not to watch out of sympathy for giggles.Some of its scenes are imaginative and poetic enough to warrant wasting a lazy afternoon watching the progression of Indian cinema.The movie-within-a-movie backstory caught us off guard. Totally different feel and tone. Fragmented experience overall. Sometimes we were quite confused.

First I have to say that some of the graphics was pretty good. The plot was legendary and epic. The problems are: Kattappa. The real reason Kattappa must have killed Bahubali is that Bahubali has the habit of putting his leg on Kattappa's head. WTF. It should be no mystery. It was a righteous kill. Bahubali deserved it. Also he inadvertantly told Tamanna she is supposed to be a woman and a woman should wear make-up and look pretty. That is all. Item song falls in the middle neither good nor bad. Despite that it is just average. The good ratings are because of hype. When people say that this movie is the answer to LOTR or Troy I get annoyed because, why should this movie be an answer to anything. I did not know that there was a ? after LOTR or Troy.

Shivudu (played by Prabhas) spends his life trying to climb to the top of the waterfall. When he finally succeeds, he finds the large kingdom of Mahishmati, and falls in love with a girl (played by Tamannaah) from a rebel group who are trying to rescue their queen from Mahishmati's evil king. Shivudu, brave and fearless, vows to rescue the queen himself.Despite the predictable plot, this Telugu action-drama is all around fantastic. The acting was solid, the scenery and settings gorgeous, and the music (songs and incidental) excellent.

Secondly, apologies from my Indian friends, but even though I understand that these dances and songs are part of their culture, honestly watching those as part of an 'epic' film does not work and just made me laugh.All in all, Baauhubali was really one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever seen. Bad CGI, bad acting, bad editing, bad bad bad. Perhaps an Indian person can watch this, but definitely a western viewer will not be able to watch it (especially the first half, as in the second one the battle scenes are somewhat ok)."

" Bahubali: The Beginning Review
",0.0,0.9979,2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Baahubali
Baahubali - The Beginning is a film co-written and directed by S S Rajamouli. As I remember watching the trailer about 3 years ago, I could go on praising the grandeur of the film. And I watched the film back then and couldn't stop praising it. Watching it again after a long time, made me feel nostalgic.Plot: Shivudu's life changes after he meets AvanthikaStory and direction: I still don't think that there is nothing that is quite great with the story. It is a mishmash of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Anyone watching it will know what I am talking about. But the way S S Rajamouli has taken what we know and incorporated into the world of Mahismati is incredible. The story also doesn't provide you all the information at once. It keeps the mystery so that the audience stay intrigued and interested. You can see the hard work that has gone into the making of this magnum-opus. I can go on praising the Mahismati kingdom. The characters are also varied and interesting. You can care for each character that is in the film. The stunt sequences are also great and look very much real (quite rare in South Indian cinema). But everything has faults and so does this one. I felt the romantic track was added just to bring the audience to the theatres. It just added to the runtime and nothing substantial was there in that. Also the VFX was OK. In some scenes, you can just guess that green/blue screen was used. Also the editing is not crisp. Characters happen to just pop up at some places. Some scenes also never made sense.Performances: Prabhas stole the show. His dual roles as Babhubali and Shivudu were impressive. Rana Daggubati was great too. The stern and angered looks were nicely carried by him. Sathyaraj was impressive as Katappa. Nassar looked cruel as Bijjalaeva. Ramya Krishnan was beyond praise as Sivagami. Tamannah Bhatia was eye-candy for me. Anushka Shetty was also good in the role provided.Music: Very rarely I do love South Indian music. M M Keeravani delivers some great songs and an impressive background score. Although I liked each and every song of the film, 'Dheevera' was the one that impressed me the most.Favorite Scene: The scene just before the interval where Shivudu helps in the installation of the golden statue of Bhallaladeva. When one person happens to see Shivudu and says 'Baahubali' and everyone just repeat the same, the energy they get helps in the installation of the statue. The sheer grandness and respect for Baahubali the people have inspired me a lot.Verdict: Even with its faults and some stupidity, Baahubali is an enjoyable experience. I was never bored even for a milli-second. I am going with an 8/10."

Garnish with some jaw-dropping wackiness -- from a Western perspective, anyway -- and you've got ""Baahubali"".I have to admit I found the second movie somewhat better than the first, but by the end of ""Baahubali: The Beginning"" I was captivated by its larger-than-life characters and epic storytelling.

" A Review for American Viewers
",0.0,0.9976,2017-09-04 00:00:00,3,"I was fascinated by the rave reviews for the two Baahubali movies so I decided to give them both a try. (Any movie scoring 8 or above on IMDb has a solid chance of being a winner.)What I have learned is that IMDb scoring is subject to the social media phenomenon of being skewed by an ardent fan base. In the case of Baahubali, the movie has been a huge hit in an isolated market, continental India. A billion Indians can't be wrong, but they sure can skew an IMDb rating when they vote as a bloc.While Baahubali is astounding audiences in its native homeland (there are some great articles about the movie's importance to the industry and to the North and South regions of the country), American audiences with their highly sophisticated expectations will most likely agree with me that the overall result is an immature, incredibly predictable, poorly executed, soap opera that does not merit its hype or its two-part 5 and half hour running time.MY OBSERVATIONS: Baahubali's story is intriguing as it presents to us a legendary super hero who appears to come from a rich and ancient history/lore. The source material is every bit as promising as heroes from Western culture (Samson, Superman, Hercules, etc.). However, the execution of the story turns great drama (love, family, betrayal, support from the gods, fall from grace) into a soap opera complete with cheesy reaction shots accompanied by shock music more appropriate for 1970s TV sitcoms with their spit takes and laugh tracks.The highly applauded visual effects are mediocre by American standards. Other reviewers have detailed these issues adequately so I will only add my support to their criticisms.The acting is hit or miss. Some scenes come across powerfully (love scenes, for example) while others (like those in the royal court) remind us of American TV sitcoms from the 1970s.BOTTOM LINE: If you are calibrated to fine cinema, are looking for a good epic, and are considering Baahubali, then do some research and enter into the viewing prepared to walk away. I, for one, wish I could get my 5 and half hours back."
" Epic epic
",0.0,0.985,2017-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Although differing in style from what I am used to, ""Baahubali: The Beginning"" (2015) is a great fantasy epic ‚Äì think of Lord of the Rings with a bit of Fred and Ginger stirred in. Every clich√© shot is shamelessly thrown in, so there are lots of freeze-frame action poses, running away from burning backdrops, slow-motion carnage, prodigious jumps with heroic landings, hyper-dramatic sunsets, and tough guy squints and sneers ‚Äì a little over-the-top at times but always entertaining. As I was watching a sub-titled version, I can't really comment on the acting but the characters all looked and sounded the part. The tone of film is quite uneven: other than the bloody prologue the first act is quite lighthearted but then progresses to lots of bloody stabbings, impalements and decapitations in the second act. The showpiece final battle is a real mix: graphic gore and incinerations mixed with 'cartoon style violence' (e.g. picking up men by their feet and using them like flails ‚Äì an absolute lack of respect for the laws of physics permeates the film). Plus, there is an awesome chariot equipped with spinning blades that reminded me of the head-chopper in Caligula (1979), which is good enough for an extra point in my rating. All in all, a fun fantasy epic and an interesting example of the parallels and contrasts between ""Eastern"" and ""Western"" big-budget action cinema. Lets hope the success of this film prompts an equally ambitious movie version of the ""Ramayana""."

Baahubali: The Beginning ( BTB) is , in short, a very typical over the top movie with average special effects and over-acting.The movie, thus carried on the tradition of portraying larger than life heroes who are loaded with virtues , venerated and adored by all, to the point of sycophancy. An unoriginal movie, one can see the heavy influence of Hollywood flicks. The scale of the movie is huge and as often happens, the director sacrifices quality for grandeur. The first half of the film features a boring romantic plot and cheap side effects. The second half is more entertaining with better side effects and plot progress. Like all historical fiction based on a warrior hero, the movie glorifies chauvinism . The female chauvinists are as violent as the males ( this undoubtedly is gender equality). The director cannot be faulted for over-glorifying nationalism ( given the current political narrative in the country).However, the movie's popularity shows that people love chauvinism subservience. In a scene Kattapa ( of the Kattaapa ne Baahubali ko kyon mara fame ) places the feet of the newly born Baahubali on his head. One journalist likened this scene to the current situation of the media , which is ready to boot-lick the government .Having said that , the movie is much better than pretentious Bollywood flicks featuring Kapoors and Sons/Daughters. Had the movie been a little light on patriotism and melodrama , it could have been much more enjoyable. A little more attention to detail could have been given. For example: You cannot have a scene where a woman is running around in summer slips when there is snow all around. Also Baahubali is not a character from Contra that he can jump against gravity . In fact Baahubali's chief difficulty and concern while trying to scale the mountain is not the prospect of a fatal fall ( he falls many times, and slides down like on a joy-slide in Disneyland) but the monotony of having to do it all over again.Amazing. Not really."

Old fashioned but most impressive. Attracts itself. Song is awesome. Most of the power is in mystery, the suspense. VFX is most impressive, taking it on the grounds of Hollywood. Loved a lot. Heart touching. Story calls soul to watch again and again."
" Its just the beginning!
",0.0,0.9956,2017-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Baahubali the beginning is not a movie it's a world of visual wonders. Creator SS Rajamouli and Vijendra Prasad garu done a good job. In some sequences the CGI is gone but overall it's a perfect movie for the viewers. Darling Prabhas you are outstanding in every way. All the cast members are superb except Tamannaah. She has talent but I think she is not the perfect choice for Avantika's role. Other cast members include Ramya Krishna, Rana, Nasser, Sathyaraj and Anushka well much appreciated. The background songs and music is fantastic. Overall it's a great entertainer for the viewers."
" The Best movie.....After Watching Part 2
",0.6369,0.8694,2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"Yes, now i can say that part 1 is the best movie. because yesterday i had seen part 2 and i get very bad experience and waste my time for watching 3rd class movie.In Part 1 , there was an best story and suspense also. so most of people are asking question like ""Why kattapa killed bahubali ?""Main thing in part 1 is , Director are showing natural beauty. so lost of scene are fantastic"
" Clich√© elevated from Gutter to BlockBuster by Fanboys.
",0.5994,0.9705,2017-05-05 00:00:00,3,"Test whether this movie was a clich√© or not? 1. Pathetic romance where hero woos a beautiful actress by stalking and harassing her. And after one song they are in love. 2. A sad mother waiting for his son to take revenge. ""Mere karan Arjun aayenge"". 3. Hero has enormous superhuman like strength and intelligence without any battle training and can beat 20 people with weapons bare handed. 4. Physics is just ignored. 5. Plot copied from movies 300 (Trishul battle defence), Troy, Matrix trilogy (the chosen one concept, multiple fight scenes), Lord of the Rings etc.People said this was best VFX ever. Best VFX is the one where after watching the scene you say - I wonder where they shot this movie-this place is so beautiful. Which means although movie looks aesthetically pleasing but VFX is ""undetectable"". The moment you are able to VFX is being used, it becomes pathetic VFX.This movie highlights starvation and craving of us Indians for watching a half a decent movie, so much so, that a clich√©d with non-existent plot is said to be the best Indian movie ever and is reinforced by the fact that everyone else likes it - Typical Herd Mentality. This movie is Andho mein Kaana Raja. (One eyed man is King among blind people). It is almost like religion, people have desire to give their life a bigger meaning even there isn't one, and they hold on to this meaning so dearly that all logic seems to become their enemy."
" Impressive
",0.5106,0.9278,2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"With second installment on this series out, if you have not watched this one then please DO watch it before you go for second one. Both first and second parts are great. Great acting, screenplay, location everything. First part is available on you tube for free in HD quality. If you want good entertainment, and looking for movie with good story line, and solid acting then go for it. There are some parts which may seem unreal - like main characters have too much strength, but give it is story about 1000s of years ago. Good things is it is not about any super powers or extra terrestrial powers."
" Don't waste your 3 hours
",0.3252,-0.4069,2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"I usually don't watch Bollywood masala movies. They are mostly copied in their entirety from Hollywood, Hong Kong or other cinema industries or at least bit and pieces shamelessly plagiarized. This most expensive movie coming out of India is no different. I wonder where did they spend the money because CGI looked like 80s work. Scenes changing from hot tropical climate to snow laden ground yet people running around only in summer clothes, leaping unbelievable distances even for a fantasy movie. I was pressured into watching this waste of time and money from my Indian peers. And as usual I have sworn, I am never gonna listen to them again but I know it will happen. My advice stay away from this for the sake of your own sanity."
" Fantastic fabulous super !
",0.9041,0.951,2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,Story Line and direction : Very good epic part chosen from very well known Indian history. Dialogues delivery is very strong. Way of direction is of world level. VFX Technologies used are of world level.Casting : Every single character did his best of best. Movie will not allow you to move for a single minute. :PIf you have not seen this movie yet then you must go for this.
" Greatest movie in the Indian History - A visual wonder!!
",0.6988,0.999,2017-04-27 00:00:00,9,"The first thing and the positive aspect that grabbed my attention to the movie is it's great director - SS.RAJAMOULI !!! Rajamouli is one of the fantastic directors in India with all of his films being a blockbuster success in the Tollywood Industry. The people over Tollywood feel proud about him and his films & they go crazy for his films.Rajamouli works with simple stories (mostly written by his Father K. V. Vijayendra Prasad) but his narration and his taking with a beautifully architectural screenplay makes the audience spine-chill and gains him success.Coming to the second thing is the title with strongest pillars - Prabhas and Rana and the other characters.You just have to look at how Rajamouli gives every major character in Baahubali its own heroic introduction to realize how keenly he is attuned to the pulse of the audience and knows what button to push to make them cheer.PLUS POINTS : As you start watching Baahubali, one thing that hits you instantly is the scale of this magnum opus. The extravagant sets, spectacular visuals and the sheer magnitude has not been showcased in any Indian film before. One cannot shy away to laud Rajamouli for thinking something this huge and also executing it on such a mammoth scale. The war sequences and the way they have been executed are in true Hollywood style. Prabhas is terrific in a dual role and is the apt choice as Baahubali. No one except him could have done justice to the role which is larger than life and has many heroic moments. His sheer screen presence and emotional performance will be immensely loved by his fans. As expected, Rana is menacing as the baddie Bhalaladeva. This is a dream role for him and he gives a top notch performance as the bad guy. Ramya Krishna is elegant as Shivagami and brings a lot of depth to the film. Nasser and Satyaraj play their roles perfectly. Second half of the film has a lot of emotions which elevate the film to another level.MINUS POINTS : The story line of Baahubali is quite routine and predictable. The actual film kick starts only during the second half and ends abruptly which might leave you a bit unhappy. Anushka has nothing much to do in the film as her character will be revealed only during the second part.Certain war sequences have been dragged out and could have been trimmed to decrease the run time. There is so much hype surrounding the film that certain unwanted songs side tracks the film. The romance between Prabhas and Tamanna also looks exaggerated at times.TECHNICAL ASPECTS : Where do I start from in this section. Baahubali is by far the most technically brilliant film that has come out from Indian cinema. Each and every frame in the film is sheer magic. The sets, VFX work and graphics are just out of this world. One should be really proud to see such grand visuals especially in a Telugu film. Music is decent but the background score could have been better.Next in line is the art direction. Sabu Cyril has done a marvelous job with the sets. Be it the palace sets, the kingdom surroundings or the warfare equipment, everything looks impressive. Senthil Kumar's camera work is mind blowing. His awesome visuals are nicely complimented by the stunning VFX. The water fall scenes and some shots during the fight sequence with Kaalakeya have been executed brilliantly.The way Rajamouli has conceptualized the visuals will be a learning lesson for a generation of aspiring film makers. Even though Rajamouli's screenplay dips a bit here and there, his larger than life approach is what makes this film such a visual treat.SUMMARY : Baahubali is one film which every Indian movie lover can be extremely proud off. Right from the word go, this visual extravaganza treats you to some never before seen elements in Indian films. Prabhas's stunning avatar as Baahubali, brilliant art work to some eye topping visuals effects, this film has it all. Genius director Rajamouli, should be lauded and supported for his dedication in taking Telugu cinema to the next level. Finally, if you ignore the predictable story line and keep your expectations in check, Baahubali is bound to entertain you big time."
" the most overrated
",0.0,0.1901,2017-04-22 00:00:00,1,Its the most overrated movie. It does deserve about 6 out of 10 but giving 1 because others rated 10 out of 10. This movie is fun to watch but nothing more that. People have been rating 10 because they haven't watched enough English movies or koreans/Chinese. Awful acting by Tamannah and Songs made no sense.
" Visually Stunning with lots of great actions!
",0.7901,0.9703,2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"I'm not really a fan of Hindi-Movies in General but after i didn't really find any good movies to watch an evening i took the opportunity to see if there was any movie outside of Hollywood and Britain that i missed. I stumbled upon the trailer and was shocked by its visual appearance. I actually liked the comedy it portraited combined with the serious story. I would say the plot reminds me of the Disney classic ""Prince of Egypt"" with the action scenes similar of ""Troy/300"". The Visual effects reminds me of Game Of Thrones and it does have some musical aspects to it as well. When combining all of this, it does make it a very entertaining to watch and i recommend it to all people that like adventure/action flicks. 9/10"
" it is a copied film.
",0.0,-0.6289,2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"though it has created a little bit curiosity in telugu audience, but it miserably failed in terms of originality. the director rajamouli has copied each and every scenes from Hollywood , Japanese and some from korean films. some scenes are copied from TV serials also ( eg: the rope scene where protagnist jumps and rana gives him rope, this is copied from sony channel's CID). story is very weak.nothing special in this movie. since telugu audience are not familiar with CGI shots , this film got hit."
" Best ever from the heart of India
",0.6369,0.9385,2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,It is not until very late that I saw the shape of this film entirely. I have seen bits and pieces of it previously but its the first time I saw the whole film and I must say I loved it. Pulling off such a vfx heavy film so brilliantly itself speaks the journey. A must watch. It will grip you every single moment and will make you long for more.
" Idiotic Piece of Crap
",-0.7351,0.9595,2017-03-28 00:00:00,1,"A cheap copy of Game of Thrones. CGI look like a cheap video game and the same old shitty story. Yes Hero, who should be the most handsome guy with super human qualities of Hollywood superheroes combined. and yes a love story and a few songs. These South Indian Directors and Actors need some serious lectures on how Physics work."
" Pure garbage. Worst CGI ever. Pathetic star cast n acting.
",-0.8316,0.9371,2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"In the ancient Kingdom of Mahishmati in India, Sivagami, the queen (Ramya Krishnan), emerges from a cave adjoining a big waterfall, carrying a baby.
