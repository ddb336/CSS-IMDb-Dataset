" Beautiful Porcelain Story for most people
",0.5994,0.9499,2021-04-11 00:00:00,5,"This was a nice movie for those who aren't the 'other people'. The title accurately reflects the main premise that stays with you. How we always think the worst things will occur to other people and then we don't know how to handle it when they do occur. It's a movie that is a solid drama and characters are quite relatable. And if you have a terminal disease, I hope you reach your end in a way that is as comfortable and beautiful as is the case in this movie.But the movie does not reflect the reality of those 'other people'. Reality is so very different, the movie actually feels like a slap in the face to those who have actually gone through the entire affair of loved ones with terminal illnesses. It's such a porcelain story it almost makes you feel guilty for the things you didn't do with loved ones. Unlike in the movie you usually can't put time on hold and have a perfect ending doing parties, visiting places doing things without constant care. The reality is grim and constantly needing to make decisions that are never the right ones and fear for all that is to come.Maybe it's a movie that can show you what's nice to do when a person has been diagnosed with cancer, is wealthy, still has plenty of time to live and has a group of people that have all the time in the world to support them. However, if you are one of those 'other people' you 99% surely won't have such a porcelain end."
" So heartfelt
",0.5849,0.9267,2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand any rating below a 10 - this was such a great movie - the acting, writing for sure but mostly the honesty and heart throughout - all around wonderful"
" Tissues.....get some

" Smooth and outstanding
",0.6124,0.8452,2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"Waves of emotions just come to hit you throughout the movie. You feel like you're a member of the family going through what they're experiencing. AMAZING performance by Molly Shannon and jesse plemons.
Highly recommended."
" A nice, ok film.
",0.6124,0.9872,2020-10-26 00:00:00,5,"A nice, gentle, family orientated movie. Ginger guy's acting is amazing (again).
It is not complex, and stays mostly in the shallow end of the pool of life.
Its about love and loss, a lot of movies have been made about this. This one didnt necessarily add something that wasn't there. But it was a nice gentle, watch.
Many may only focus on the pain, but I see a very privileged woman lucky enough to have so many family around here that love her. That is a super rich life.
One time watch. No favourite."
" Fantastic
",0.5574,0.9501,2020-08-26 00:00:00,10,"Great writing, great acting, touching, genuine. A great balance of being realistic and still heartfelt."
" Awful!
",-0.5093,-0.7352,2020-07-20 00:00:00,2,"This is fucked up! I am sorry, but why does any movie that plays the gay card have a high rating and an exaggerated positive feedback?! Seriously guys, I mean what on earth was that plot and performance? Too lame, too slow, too unfitting, too poor and too incoherent. Never touching, never serious, never humouras, never nothing! I like the actors, but this is not a movie."
" Pretty mediocre
",0.4939,0.5106,2020-06-08 00:00:00,5,"Although it does have fun moments, this is not enough to make up for the underinspired plot."
" Good acting and strong scenes
",0.7351,-0.7543,2020-04-12 00:00:00,6,"It's a Good movie, but a bit slow in the beginning. At the same time there's some funny comments here and there and scenes that are sad and it's hard to hold back the tears. It's a shame that they didn't do more around the story, i feel it could be much more to it, than what they did."
" Bad film
",-0.5423,-0.5106,2019-10-06 00:00:00,1,Terrible film. It is sad that people give good rating for something because it is gay
" The power of a story.
",0.0,0.743,2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,"This film is an in-depth look at a story that has touched us all in some way. Uniquely personal and relevant, each character brings an honest portrayal to the table. Sad, but so full of hints at what life is truly about. Insight into what it must truly be like to lose the battle with cancer- told from the perspective of someone we all feel like we are. We are all lovers, children, insecure, hoping to succeed, alone, lonely, confused, and so many things- though more often than not we put that away until we have to face it for some reason or another. Films like these force us to examine the hard truths- they force us to relate to every human. Watch this one alone."
" Small but effective drama
",0.631,0.8363,2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,Drama with comedic elements based on real life events that happened to writer/director Chris Kelly. Although cinematically often rather flat it is an engaging drama that doesn't skimp on the often deeply difficult elements of the story namely a woman (an excellent performance by Molly Shannon) losing her battle with cancer and the effect of those around her. The story is mainly seen through the eyes of her eldest son David a rather shy awkward gay man who leaves his failed relationship and unsuccessful writing career in New York to move back to Sacramento to be with his mother. Jesse Plemons is also rather excellent in the role of David.The setting of Sacramento and David's job in comedy writing made me make comparisons with two other more widely viewed and distributed films from around this time Ladybird and The Big Sick and while those two films are on the whole better this film is still worth viewing with some sequences leaving a great impression. If you loved those two films chances are you'll like this one.
" Raw, Real, and Beautiful
",0.5994,-0.7074,2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,"The overall rating for this movie does not do it justice. A movie about life from so many angles - a matriarch battling cancer, a gay son struggling for acceptance, children watching the affects of cancer on someone they love, a husband trying - and sometimes failing - to care for his wife as she loses her strength.In its raw view of reality, it is beautiful. And worth watching."
" Touching and not schmaltzy
",0.0,0.8634,2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Of all the ""dying"" movies I've seen this one is the best. It's a great cast with top-notch performances. Usually these types of movies try to be hankies all the way through so they are so overdone they are almost a caricature. Not so this movie. No spoilers from me. I highly recommend."
" heart breaking family life
",0.0,0.796,2018-04-18 00:00:00,7,David (Jesse Plemons) is a gay NY TV writer. His pilot gets cancelled and he moves back home to Sacramento to care for his mother (Molly Shannon) with terminal cancer. His father (Bradley Whitford) is the only one in the family refusing to accept his homosexuality. There are his two younger sisters. It's a tough year as his mother slowly deteriorates.There is a sense of easy quiet improvisation about the movie. It could laud one to sleep until it reveals its devastating heart. There are some real heart-breaking scenes. It's hard not to feel for this family. I do wish for more of David's relationship and not have the breakup. The dating scene feels like forced comedy. I just want Zach Woods to come out to California to meet his dad. I want more heart and less forced comedy. There is that super sad scene with David's friends in New York. There are some really great real scenes. There are lots of familiar faces doing small roles. It's a solid indie.
" We broke up
",-0.4215,0.2247,2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"David (Jesse Plemons) while being gay, is an unsuccessful comedy writer. He travels from NYC to Sacramento to be with his family and dying mother Joanne, (Molly Shannon) who has Leiomyosarcoma Cancer. David's father (Bradley Whitford) has never accepted his son being gay, a topic they avoid, but eventually does surface, as his being gay is the other half of the story. His two sisters help out (Madisen Beaty, Maude Apatow.) The film opens up as it ends, rather sadly. The first half of the film has some light moments and laughs, but about half way through it turns into a serious drama that is nearly all sad, a mild tear-jerker. Acting was good. The script was top notch, for what it was, but had less appeal to me.Guide: F-word, MMsex, brief nudity."
" Average Movie
",0.0,0.8047,2017-08-10 00:00:00,3,"Overall good performance by all the actors. The first hour is fine however the film dragged on for far too long that i lost interests. If it can be edited down to 1 hour 20 min, it would be a better movie. Not too bad for a first movie. 3/10 from me. Worth a watch if you have the time and the mood for some depressing drama."
" How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life
",-0.4767,0.9664,2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"IMDb.com classifies this 2016 film as a comedy/drama. Well there are one or two laughs but they are of the nervous variety. The focus here is on drama. A struggling comedy writer, played by Jesse Plemons is fresh off a breakup and in the midst of the worst year of his life. He returns to Sacramento, to the bosom of his family to care for his dying mother, Molly Shannon in an outstanding performance.Train's ""Drops of Jupiter"" features several times during the movie; the lyrics of which deal with someone dying. Lead singer Patrick Monahan has stated that the song was inspired by his late mother, who had died after a struggle with cancer. It is apt.Other People is writer Chris Kelly's first big screen outing as director. He is also currently an Emmy-nominated Co-Head Writer at ""Saturday Night Live"". Other People debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016. Molly Shannon won Best Supporting Female at the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Awards while Jesse Plemons was nominated for Best Male Lead; Chris Kelly for Best First Screenplay and all deservedly so.Above all this is a human drama. Multi-layered, the story is about the illness and death of the family's mother from cancer. It also deals with the father's reaction and his lack of acceptance of his son being gay. To borrow a line from Captain Kirk in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan – ""how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life""Have the tissues ready.A solid 4 out of 5."
" heartfelt and humorous
",0.7269,0.9925,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Unfortunately, this wonderful movie is severely underrated and underseen for whatever reason. If more people were aware of this movie's actual existence I am certain it would be receiving much more attention and praise, because it really is a damn good movie. There are lots of problems with it, but as a whole it's really great. For the most part, the script is extremely witty and well done, and all of the tragic elements blend with the comic quite well-although one could easily argue that this films mixture of emotions is as much of a curse as it is a blessing. I will admit that it caught me a little off guard when a drastic tonal shift would occur, however the movie definitely never feels ridiculous and convoluted tonally. For the most part, everything remains quite consistent-its all very sad, but also hopeful and hilarious. All of the performances are quite good, especially Molly Shannon whose mostly known for her comedic roles but gives a solid dramatic performance in this film as the main character's mother, who is dying of cancer. While also remaining funny and heartfelt, this movie brings up topics and themes of life, loss, love, death, sexuality, and family relationships in an extraordinarily powerful and realistic way. Although it is slow at times and not all of the jokes work, its an overall lovely, emotional, and funny little movie. Check it out!"
" Cant understand why this isn't 9/10 amazing film.
",-0.4717,0.9835,2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"maybe its because he is gay and people are idiots, i dunno but the main theme of this film is cancer, family, and living what time is left... i never cry and never leave reviews but this film had me crying with laughter and then 20 minutes later sobbing my heart out... if you watch one film this month please let it be this one...the acting is amazing, its one of those films that you forget is even pretend, i was fully fully invested in each character and it was beautifully shot, great soundtrack and written perfectly. an almost perfect film.as i said i never leave reviews but this deserves it. just watch the trailer and i swear you will download this movie... great job to all involved... spectacular."
" Shannon's dignified cancer victim is not enough to compensate for Kelly's self-pitying failed comedy writer
",-0.6249,-0.9849,2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Kimberly Jones of The Austin Chronicle explains the title of Chris Kelly's new dramedy: ""For the lucky ones, untouched by tragedy, bad things are what happen to other people."" Kelly's protagonist, David Mulcahey (Jesse Plemons) is a failing New York based gay comedy writer who returns to his Sacramento suburban home to take care of his mother Joanne (Molly Shannon), dying of a rare cancer. As Jones informs, David's ""other people"" now ""become his people.""Kelly realizes that an unrelenting story about a cancer victim and how it affects friends and family might become a little too heavy-handed for his audience to tolerate for the duration of an entire feature film, so he injects a modicum of humor to balance things out. Unfortunately not all of the humor hits the mark—Erin Whitney of Screen Crush asks us to consider the opening scene where David and the rest of his family-- including his distant, gay-aversive father and younger sisters--are lying in bed, crying for their dying mother: ""A friend who has just learned of Joanne's cancer leaves a heedless voicemail, wishing the now-dead Joanne good health while arguing with a Taco Bell employee in a drive-thru."" For Whitney, ""this is the type of hollow humor that underlines much of Other People, a would-be dramedy that's too removed and too safe to leave a lasting impression.""Whitney echoes the main criticism of Other People by those critics unimpressed by Kelly's protagonist, modeled on his own experiences: ""it's much more about its lead character wallowing in self-pity. David expresses so much contempt for those around him; Sacramento folk, his family, every guy on OKCupid, and a hometown acquaintance with writing aspirations, but much of his sorrow lacks real passion."" A.A. Dowd of A.V. Club wisely argues that the focus on David's self-pity leads to the lack of development of other characters: ""But the bigger problem may be David himself, who's a bit exhausting in his self-pity...'I'll have no mom, no dad, no boyfriend, no job,' David whines early on—and if Other People is willing to occasionally acknowledge his selfishness, it also adopts his tunnel vision so completely that few other characters (including David's younger sisters, one of them played by an Apatow daughter) ever gain much dimension.""Justin Chang notices the inconsistency in some of the characters: "" It's the sort of movie that treats David's grandparents (June Squibb, Paul Dooley) as senile comic targets one minute and spouters of sentimental wisdom the next.""But Keith Watson in Slant Magazine argues that Other People is at its sharpest when David's family and friends step on the stage: ""While these characters exist primarily to teach David various lessons (be more confident, put yourself out there, reconnect with your family), Kelly provides his actors with enough space to make an impact. J.J. Totah, for example, steals every scene he's in as a flamboyantly gay tween who at one point performs a wildly inappropriate drag show to politely perplexed silence.""Most of the critics agreed that it was Molly Shannon's performance as David's afflicted mother that gives the film its gravitas. Watson in Slant points out: ""Shannon's performance locks into the film's most fully realized theme: that even the grueling misery of dying cannot rob you of a sense of humor if you don't allow it to."" And Chang in Variety seconds Watson's comments: ""Even with her face pale and gaunt, and her head shaved, the character possesses a luminosity that seems to glow all the more brightly as her condition worsens, as if in defiance of the cancer's steady onslaught.""A.A. Dowd argues that Other People has great value in its frank treatment of the effect on people who must deal with an afflicted cancer victim: ""it's at its best when getting into the nitty-gritty of coping with the disease—from an uncomfortably frank discussion of burial arrangements to the family serving as interpreter for a fading Joanne, repeating everything she croaks out in a hoarse whisper to those outside their immediate circle.""Perhaps the most revelatory scene in Other People is David's supermarket melt-down. Everything that's been bothering him including his father's rejection of his sexuality, his recent break-up with his gay lover, rejection of his script by TV network professionals and especially his mother's sad decline, adds to the inevitable moment when he breaks down and blurts out he's a ""good person."" The sub-text to that statement of course is ""why am I a victim?"" as well as ""why am I not successful?"" There is something very self-pitying about David and he evinces a clear lack of insight into his situation. Indeed he's a ""good person"" in the way he takes care of his dying mother. But his desire for success is forced—not only does he try too hard but he's too focused on himself. Hence, David ends up the least interesting character in Kelly's narrative, not only for his self-pity but his narcissism as well.As some critics have argued, Other People's main character is in effect too much of a sad sack to interest us. If there's any redemption, it's in the portraits of some of the supporting players, especially Molly Shannon as a cancer victim who brings both mirth and a quiet dignity to a most difficult role."
" All the feels
",0.0,0.957,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Let it be known that the minute I finished this movie I felt the need to review it and somehow personally let Chris Kelly know how much of a fan I am of this work.I'm not great with words and I've never written a review before, so please bear with me on this one.I watched this on a whim while I was at home on a Saturday. Chris Kelly told a wonderful story and directed a wonderful movie. I laughed so much and I cried harder than ever before during this one. All the feels were felt, and isn't that how a good movie is supposed to make you feel?I knew going into this I wouldn't be disappointed as I was highly impressed with the cast, but it's really the writing and directing that did it for me. This was a really beautiful project and I cannot wait to see and hear more dramatic work from the talented Chris Kelly."
" Great Little Gem I found on The Netflix
",0.6249,0.9817,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I very much enjoyed this film and didn't see a preview beforehand, so I didn't know what to expect. I watched it because it had Molly Shannon in it, and she's just a peach. Upon watching this.. I'm like, ""OK, we got a gay character....OK, another gay character... Oh, no we are in a gay bar making jokes."" So that was a pleasant surprise there. Also, this movie isn't ""hilarious"" as I saw on advertisements and such. This movie has its funny moments, but it's camouflaged over top of very touching emotional issues and Molly Shannon's character, whom is a dying of cancer. So, ""hilarious"" is too much of a word to say considering I was crying with little hints of chuckling here and there. This movie deserves better ratings, but people suck.. So, I can't expect more than the rating it has. Also, I'd like to say that Jesse Plemons did a GREAT job in his role. I forgot that he was in other movies to be honest, because he was so believable as this gay character... And I hadn't paid that much attention to his work before this. :/ I do remember him in Battleship upon seeing he was in that like 10 minutes ago, and remember thinking he was a little cutie. He has a Matt Damon thing about him going on. I guess his character in this film reminded me of myself, very much so.. And I just wanted to give him a big hug. But enough about me.. Just watch it if you want to watch something touching and you feel compassion for families dealing with losing someone."
" Without Shannon it would of sucked.
",-0.4588,0.9655,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is at best mediocre, a mediocre story, with mediocre writing and mediocre acting, well besides Molly Shannon. She carried the show, with her powerful emotions being conveyed so perfectly and her commitment to the character. Without her the movie would of got 4 stars at best. When she wasn't on camera I felt my attention span slowly decreasing as I watched Plemon (Todd from Breaking Bad), who has potential, try and match Shannon's acting. To conclude this movie is worth watching for some quality acting by Shannon but still lacks very many important things that makes it a 2016 great."
