",0.5859,0.9782,2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,An incredibly beautiful animation. I really enjoyed. The story was really great and fascinating. The characterization was great too. It fulfills everything you expect from a good animation.
" Overshadowed by Frozen
",0.0,0.8266,2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie came out Nov. 7, 2014 and then Frozen came out exactly 20 days later. This movie is amazing and so underrated. The animation is absolutely beautiful and the whole movie was just ugh chefs kiss. However, when Frozen came out, everybody forgot about it and it became overshadowed.Yes, Frozen was a good movie, but so was Big Hero Six and it didn't get the appreciation it deserves."

" Iron Marshmallow Man Flies in San Fransokyo
",0.0,0.9822,2021-01-05 00:00:00,7,"""Big Hero 6"" occupies a visually dense and splendid alternate anachronistic future world--namely, the city of San Fransokyo--a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo that aptly reflects the picture's American-Japanese hybrid universe, which itself is a result of the Americanization of the comic book's Japanese settings as created by Americans for Marvel. For the most part, however, the focus is on the relationship between Hiro (sounds like ""hero"") and his inflatable marshmallow-man-looking robotic healthcare provider, Baymax. ""Big Hero 6"" is at its best after Hiro equips Baymax with a suit that's a mix between Iron Man and Buzz Lightyear and flies atop him through San Fransokyo and through a trippy portal. This is the brilliance of computer animation, for no other cameras can soar through a space in this manner, nor may that space otherwise be so wonderfully designed. Even live-action productions need resort to virtual cinematography and CGI for such tasks.Otherwise, the narrative here is flawed, while I would've favored more sight-seeing of San Fransokyo. The elaborate backstory involving robot fights, the science-y mumbo jumbo and the seemingly requisite tragic incident considerably delays the more amusing bromance antics between Hiro and Baymax and the eventual superheroics. The other four members of the superhero team are poorly developed and, consequently, uninteresting. As is the supervillain stuff for the most part, although the movie does play around a bit with the trope of an evil corporation and executive. The Iron Man parallels seem further extended by this, as Hiro turns away from profiteering over his microbots in favor of aiding mankind--or at least employing technology to improve his own superheroics--as well as being blown back by a fiery blast that hurts him (it's a different kind of hurt, Baymax)--like Tony Stark. Plus, it always strikes me as odd, if not deviously hypocritical, when a multinational conglomerate like Disney peddles even a hint of an anti-corporate message. Regardless, ""Big Hero 6"" is alone worthwhile to see for Hiro and Baymax soaring."
" Its never hopeless
",0.357,-0.9277,2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"This is some very heavy stuff for a kids film. An orphan boy living with his aunt who then loses his older brother whos basically a father figure to him. There's this one scene where the older brother tries to build a helper robot and it took him 100 times before it worked. This teaches kids (and all us all for that matter) that when you fail you try, try again, even if it means trying over 60 times, no matter how frustrating it is, how much it stresses you, how hopeless it seems, you don't give up. And you will make it eventually. Most things worth doing are not easy."
" We took this for granted
",0.25,0.9952,2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,"A lot of reviewers are very critical about Big Hero 6. ""The twist villain is bad written"", I agree, but this movie has so much more to offer us! It's based around the trauma, mourning and feelings of revenge from the protagonist, Hiro. I haven't seen a lot of Disney movies who did this the right way. It really shows us; What do I feel and what do I need? What can I do and what would Tadashi has wanted?Big Hero 6 is set in an utopian futuristic city. It's mixed with Tokyo and San Francisco elements. When you watch the movie, you're able to feel the Californian and Japanese influences. I like all the characters, except for the twist villain. My problem with him is that he is poorly developed. It kinda came out of nowhere. Probably because we hadn't time enough to care about him? Well, although I like all the characters, I think only Hiro and his aunt have a proper arc. The hero team is fun and are good friends, but the movie should have gotten a sequel to make their personalities completer. There's a tv show though, so maybe that works? The movie has also really good visual effects and the animation is beautiful, it fits very well with the story and the atmosphere.Why do I say ""we took this for granted""? I think a lot of people will say this movie is the worst from this Disney Animation era, but I think it's just different and did that very good. It holds up with the Renaissance movies. Big Hero 6 has a lot of emotional moments and a good message for young and old. It's also an adaptation from the Marvel comics, which is very special for Disney. Yes, it has its problems, but so had every movie.I also recommend the making off. Available in Disney Plus with the movie by extra. That made me love the movie even more!"

Baymax carries the entire movie with his wholesome charm and emotional counseling, especially during the sequence where he runs low on battery and becomes 'Tipsy Baymax.'

It teach you about family, friends and decisions on what's right and what's wrong. About life. I could give a ten but didn't like the fate of one of the main characters.

" love this movie
",0.6369,-0.9766,2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,"The movie is based on a teen ager called Hiro Hamada who is a prodigy, as well as a high school graduate. He has quite aptitude in robotics. The the movie initiates with an illegal robot fight and our hero has quite eagerness in it.
Hiro very easily defeats Yama's robot with his prodigious Magnetic-bearing servos, although he has to face little trouble for it.
However, to show Hiro an actual place to utilize his talents his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends, Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, and also Baymax, the inflatable healthcare robot that Tadashi created. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan who is an idol in Hero's eyes and also the head of the university's robotics program. Robert Callaghan offers Hiro to join the university under the robotic program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.
To enroll, he signs up for the school's showcase and presents his project: micro-bots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable using a neurocranial transmitter. At the fair, Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the micro-bots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. As the Hamada family leaves to celebrate Hiro's success, a massive fire suddenly breaks out in the showcase hall and Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, the only person left inside. The building explodes moments later.
Two weeks later, Hiro, mourning Tadashi's death, inadvertently reactivates Baymax. The two find Hiro's only remaining microbot and follow it to an abandoned warehouse. There they discover that someone has been mass-producing the micro-bots. A man wearing a Kabuki mask attacks them with the microbot swarms. After they escape, Hiro suspects that the fire that claimed his brother may not have been accidental and in fact started by the man in the kabuki mask to cover the theft of the microbots. Seeking vengeance, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a battle chip containing various karate moves and they track the masked man to the docks. Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred arrive, responding to a call from Baymax, and the masked man chases the group. The six escape to Fred's mansion, where they decide to form a high-tech superhero team to combat the villain.
The group tracks the masked man, whom they suspect to be Krei, to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory that was used for teleportation research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group subdues him and knocks off his mask, revealing him to be Callaghan, who shielded himself from the explosion that killed Tadashi. Enraged at the discovery that Tadashi had died in vain, Hiro removes Baymax's healthcare chip and orders him to kill Callaghan. Honey re-installs the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan barely escapes, recovering the mask as he does so, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi.
Back home, Hiro repairs the robot's damaged scanners and tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax blocks his access port, convincing Hiro with video of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. Hiro remorsefully apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.
Video footage from the laboratory accident reveals that the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail, meaning that Callaghan is seeking revenge on Krei. Callaghan interrupts Krei at a public event and attempts to destroy his headquarters using Krei's teleportation portal. After a lengthy battle, the team deprives Callaghan of his microbots and the mask, saving Krei, but the portal remains active. Baymax detects Abigail alive inside and leaps into the portal with Hiro to rescue her. They find Abigail in hyper-sleep, but Baymax is struck by debris on the way back out, disabling his thrusters. With no other option but to sacrifice himself, Baymax activates his armor's rocket fist and asks Hiro if he is satisfied with his care in order to deactivate him. Hiro tearfully agrees and Baymax fires his rocket fist before deactivating, propelling Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it closes. Abigail is taken to the hospital while Callaghan is arrested.
Sometime later, Hiro discovers Baymax's health care chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax's body, who keeps his memories and emotions due to his health care chip, and he and Hiro share a hug. The university awards Hiro a grant and dedicates a building in Tadashi's honor, and Hiro, Baymax and their friends continue protecting the city.
In the end I can moral that - If we do good, good will happens with us ultimately. And hate and revenge can never be the solution of your angers."
" Good movie, but a lot of cringy montages
",0.2382,0.3919,2020-09-08 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie, and I like fallout boy, but something about the combination was cringy. All the montages with the fallout boy songs were a bit off."
" A good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater
",0.4939,0.9545,2020-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Cool animated superhero film, one that I think is good.There are moments I like about 'Big Hero 6' and moments I don't like quite as much. I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.Now for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.As for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though.All in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater."

" A Decent Pile of Disney Trash
",0.0,-0.7612,2020-08-10 00:00:00,5,"Let me put it this way:....This is by far (along with zootopia) one of the best recent Disney picks but sadly this is not a valuable price anymore, because sadly Disney has become an Trash-Below Average company.This story is worst than simple, is a painful amount of cliches and exposition that gave me a damm headache all along the way
But it improves with the characters, because its so rare to care about new characters in Disney new stuff, that this really gave me a break, I mean these characters are really likeable (with exceptions of course like the worthless plot-twisting-villian) and fun to watch
Also BTW Stan Lee¬¥s always a thumbs up
But still, a stupid movie to watch when there¬¥s nothing left on TV"
" Really cool sci-fi animation
",0.3804,0.9583,2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,This is a great film with some really cool characters and gadgets. Hiro and Baymax are a great duo and they complement the rest of the team as well. I quite enjoyed all the futuristic technology like the nanobots. The story was so-so with the plot twist being both bland and incredulous.

As a fan of animated movies I thought I'd make this tonight's movie.
My wife's reaction was less than enthusiastic upon seeing my choice.
But don't you love it when a movie turns out to be a complete surprise and exceeds any expectations you may have had?
I looked across at her to see her laughing and smiling. She thoroughly enjoyed it and so did I.
I would have liked to have given it a 10 but there was just a minor flaw in the storyline which didn't really make sense.
Overall highly recommended for all ages. Great humor, fabulous animation."

I'm proud of it. Am I not so lucky as those who look down on one today and think the other tomorrow? The world to me is full of many good things, and even if I cannot enjoy them now, I am not in a hurry to judge, leaving time to examine them again. I think this is the dividend of my personal growth.White fat man actually told a lot, told the family, told the friendship, told about revenge, faith, growth story. Of course they're cliched, but isn't it great that different characters and different stories can send me energy over and over again? In addition, the film is really so warm, I believe that everyone who watches it will want to have a white fat man of their own."

",-0.4118,-0.8206,2020-04-28 00:00:00,9,"My almost 6 year old son was very excited to see this movie. He loves robots, superheroes, sci-fi (especially Star Wars and Transformers) and Disney/Pixar. He was confused and scared by the amount of death and destruction. I think it may be because the movie seems so much more realistic than others. The animation is very life-like and unlike Wreck it Ralph/Incredibles/The Lego Movie, etc, the setting, while futuristic, isn't cartoonishly fantastic, which I think makes the character's grief, fear and anger seem very intense. We had to leave the theater early.

",0.128,0.928,2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Anga-influenced, team-based teen superhero antics with an emphasis on engineering over fantasy and mysticism. Nobody's struck by a meteor or experimented upon by the government, they're all just classmates at a prestigious technical school with a very specific set of strengths and passions. That's refreshing, both for the way it keeps the story grounded and for the limitations it places on the core characters. They're each decidedly human, even the cute inflatable robot whose personality is dictated by a memory card. Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph. Unfortunately, the greater plot runs a bit generic, its well-worn twists and turns telegraphed a mile away, so those quirks and design touches are leaned on quite often.

It's got an ""Incredibles"" feel to it, and is one of the best movies to come out in 2014. I absolutely loved it, and now I forgive Disney for making the atrocity that was ""Frozen."" This is seriously one of the best, if not THE best, Disney movie ever. This is one of the very few times I agree with Rotten Tomatoes. It holds a 90% ""fresh"" rating, and I think that that is an accurate rating. (It should have been 100%, though. Who are these critics who caused it to be less than 100%? They need to see it again.) I will definitely see this again when it hits our discount theater, and then buy it on Blu-ray the day it comes out. This was apparently based on a Marvel comic, and I wish this movie great success, and hope this will convince Disney and Marvel to open the floodgates for more lesser-known Marvel properties.

The protagonist's group of friends are unwilling to give up on the protagonist and are willing to get justice for his brother. When facing the powerful dark forces, they will not abandon or give up. Fight alongside the hero. Another thing is that the relationship between Baymax and the protagonist is friendship and family-like. At the last moment of life and death, he came forward and rescued the protagonist, which made people feel warm."

His friends Fred, Wasabi, Go, and honey lemon help him out of his darkness and realize that he doesn't need to be alone. Tadashi helps Hiro even in his time of need wherever he is. Baymax shows what it means to have a friendship and pushes Hiro to do better.
Hiro uses his intelligence to achieve the unthinkable and makes it possible. He creates a team to take down the bad guy and they become a superhero team.
Baymax made me laugh countless number of times.

" Disney Animated Marvel Movie
",0.4215,0.9994,2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Big Hero 6 is essentially the animated Guardians of the Galaxy. Both movies were based on obscure comics that few people knew about but became very successful. Even the cast in this film, very much, reminds me of the characters in Guardians. All-in-all Big Hero 6 is a very fun ride with memorable characters and a brilliant looking world. However, there are a couple issues that prevent it from being perfect.First of all, the film looks amazing. This really uses its 3D animation to the fullest. The designs are awesome and so is the science being employed here even if it is out there. However, this is a world where this type of science is possible so I rolled with it. The film has a great score and soundtrack which really helps get you pumped especially during the action scenes. When this film gets going it's a very fun ride.However, what truly drives this movie is its characters. Now, the main character, Hero, I actually thought was rather bland. He was, by no means, bad, but I found him the weakest of the primary cast. Hero's friends are all awesome. You have a superhero fanboy named Fred, a neat freak named Wasabi, chemistry whiz named Honey Lemon, and an adrenaline junkie named Go Go Tamago. Wasabi and Tamago are especially awesome to me. Tamago reminds me of Raven from the Teen Titans animated series. Wasabi is my second favorite character. His jokes, to me, were hilarious and he can be a badass too.Lastly you have Baymax who is my favorite character in the entire film. He is hilarious, badass, and just very lovable. The way him and Hero play of each other is also very well-done. His design is also great. It's simple but effective.Now, I do have a couple issues with this movie. It is a Disney film and you can see their fingerprints on this. Some of the classic Disney animated tropes are here mainly in the beginning and the end. There is a character who you know is going to die the minute he's introduced. Also it's pretty easy to guess who the villain is. They try to throw you for a loop with who it is in the first half, but it wasn't that hard to guess. In the beginning it really came down to two possible people and I could easily guess which one it was long before we got halfway through which brings me to my next point.The villain himself I thought was weak. I love his costume, but, as a character, I didn't find him that interesting. He has a typical revenge motive which I find tired. In Disney films the villain's motive is usually revenge or to gain power. The motivation wouldn't matter as much if he had more presence to him. Disney villains of the past had flimsy motivations but they leave a big impact on you like Jafar, Scar, Maleficent, and so on, but he doesn't.Also, the ending could've been trimmed down a bit. There is one scene after they defeat the villain where they have to go save this one character that has only had one scene prior so we have no emotional attachment to. The scene only seem to have been there to have a heartfelt moment where you think one of the main characters is dead but he comes back almost immediately after which makes that scene pretty much pointless. Unless that character they save becomes important in the sequel I see not importance to that scene other than to have a token heartfelt moment that every Disney film needs to have.Overall, Big Hero 6, like Guardians of The Galaxy, is a fun ride that both children and adults can enjoy. The characters are memorable, it looks amazing, the action is good, and it has plenty of funny and heartfelt moments. If you like films like Guardians then definitely give this a look."
" Pretty good overall
",0.7269,0.9256,2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"I enjoy the story and the aesthetic of this film. It's quite well done and the main protagonist is really the highlight of the film. Following his experiences and character development, his grief, and his friendship with Baymax, it's easy to care about both these characters. This character dynamic really carries the film though, cause the ""twist villain"" is just unbelievable and doesn't work at all. His motivation doesn't seem to make any sense. Other characters were quite unlikable as well, particularly the teenage stereotypes, as they don't really develop as characters and the tropes are quite painful to watch."
" A very good movie from Disney.
",0.4927,0.9851,2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this Disney film as it is a movie about a group of smart kids trying to take on a villain. However, I enjoyed the movie more when it was the kid Hiro and the inflatable robot Baymax interacting as the film was more humorous during these stages. It kind of turns into more of an action film when Hiro becomes dead set on finding out and stopping the person who stole his inventions. Still, it was good in this phase, but watching Baymax cross a room and getting around stuff was super funny.The story has a young boy who has already graduated high school and instead of taking the next step to college, he instead uses a robot to win money bot fighting. His older brother tries to get him on the right path by introducing his brother to his friends from school and his invention Baymax. This does the trick and so Hiro invents something called microbots that the head of the brother's school likes enough to enlist Hiro into the school. Unfortunately, there is an explosion and Hiro's brother dies; however, the strange discovery of a warehouse mass producing Hiro's microbots sends Hiro on a quest for revenge! He soon enlists his brother's friends help as he designs suits that use the super brainy teens specialties as powers.The film has a lot of memorable moments as it is fun watching Baymax first appearances. I also liked it when Hiro was designing the other's suits. After that, it becomes more of an action film as they try and find out the identity of the villain and stop him when they learn of his insane plan. I liked the characters, Baymax being my favorite, love it when his battery is going low and he is petting the cat going, ""Hairy baby.""So, this one was a really good film from Disney. It came after Frozen and a lot of people seem to get angry that this one did not catch on fire the way Frozen did; however, Frozen did have songs that were really catchy so that is probably what gave it an edge. Seriously, I think both films were made by the same person anyways so I am sure he doesn't care that this one did not do what Frozen did as it still performed very well at the box office. Still do not understand why a film with no sets and no actors can cost over 150 million though..."

",0.0,0.9885,2019-06-20 00:00:00,9,"One of the best modern animated Disney films out there. The setting is phenomenal, it manages to be both futuristic while also staying completely feasible in our own world. It makes a sort of superhero origin story sort of thing but has it feeling like a friendship based Disney adventure instead. The 'loss of parents' hero trick is overplayed but here it is flipped on its side where our hero starts without parents and loses family in the same story. Baymax is a lovable sidekick and each of the side characters manage to leave the spotlight to Hiro while also developing interesting and unique personalities that the audience is able to find some of themselves in. The villain has a good motive and while not amazing is still good enough to hold his own in such a fun movie."

",0.5574,0.9996,2019-06-01 00:00:00,10,"I have always loved animated films, whether they be by Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Marvel, Miyazaki or any other storytellers out there, but of late I haven't enjoyed the anime style and artwork that has been delivered. Personally I thought Frozen was so over rated, sure there was a couple of good tunes, cool, characters, interesting storyline, but it lacked that special something Mr. Disney and his crew always managed in years gone by to bring out in me. Don't get me wrong I do really like frozen but nowhere near as much as I am supposed to according to everyone else on the planet. I'm not sure what it is that I love about animated films or where the love developed from but I find myself far more attracted to them in my later years than I ever did in my earlier life. So when I heard about Big Hero 6 and the fact that both Disney and Marvel were collaborating together I pretty much had instant tingles, my expectations without seeing a single thing went higher than any film I have anticipated before. What the hell was Big Hero 6 and why hadn't I heard of it up until now?!? Why did I ever stop reading the comics!?!?Hiro Hamada is a young 14 year old boy genius who knows how to make things work, he loves his gadgets and robots. Hiro lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo with his brother Tadashi and his aunt who has taken the boys in after the loss of their parents when Hiro was three years old. Hiro spends most of his days creating and then destroying robots in underground robot battles for cash, the robots he creates devastate the competition without any mercy. After being arrested for attending one of these illegal battles Tadashi on the promise of taking Hiro to another back alley for another fight detours to his university where Hiro discovers that the genius gene doesn't fall far from the tree at all. Tadeshi introduces Hiro to his five Uni friends who each are working on their own scientific breakthroughs. Wasabi, Go Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Tadeshi then shows Hiro his latest work, a personal walking talking health specialist named Baymax who can cure all with his sweet soft tones and loving temperament. Hiro instantly loves what he sees within the university and decides he must attend. To get into the university the heads of the campus hold a special talent show where potential applicants can show their work and hopefully the university board are convinced enough to sign up the entrants giving them a scholarship to attend. Hiro creates a way to revolutionise life as we know it and wins his way into the university to the joy of everyone. While celebrating and getting ready to leave a tragedy strikes the university and Hiro loses far more than his exciting new project. With the help of his new five friends from the Uni Hiro reinvents Baymax and together the team of 6 become heroes ready to find the truth to what really happenedI thought this film had it all, I loved it from its beginning to its after credits surprise. I laughed pretty much all the way though, Baymax really grabs hold of you by your heart strings, you can't help but fall in absolute love with him. The way the animators make him move and react is adorable and will definitely keep you smiling throughout. The animation is outstanding and deserves so much applause, everything from the 3D art work to the colour to the rendering is perfect, there is nothing to pick at here in the way the film is made. The voice acting isn't any different either, the directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have chosen an amazing cast and all do a fantastic job for their individual characters as well as their group dynamics, with a couple of recognizable voices amongst the fray as well you will totally love everyone. Staring the voice talents of Scott Adsit as Baymax, Ryan Potter as Hiro, Daniel Henney as Tadashi, T.J. Miller as Fred, Jamie Chung as Go, Damon Wayans Jr. as Wasabi, Genesis Rodriguez as Honey Lemon, James Cromwell as Robert Callaghan and Alan Tudyk as Alistai"

I first watched this film in class 1 senior high school and until now I still play this film. never bored I played this film repeatedly because while watching this film mixed emotional, start from sadness, anger and weeping. yes, I came to tears twice in this film which is when Hiro lost his brother Tadashi Hamada and when the Baymax sincerely cared and entertained Hiro. it makes my heart so melting. indeed the film production from Disney never disappoints. especially in the big hero six movie, a new icon, he is Baymax. surely if baymax is in the real world, everyone wants to have it, including me, I want to hug baymax! in my opinion this film deserves to be watched at anyone age because it teaches what it means to be a sincerity from an older brother to his sister and also support in a friendship.Thank you to Disney for creating a film that is very emotional and very valuable."

" Review
",0.0,0.9895,2019-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Big Hero 6 iis based off of a young teenager (Hiro) and his new friend (Baymax) that live in a city called San Fransokyo, which is a mix of Tokyo and San Francisco. He also has an older brother (Tadashi). Baymax¬¥s is a robot and his sole purpose is to help take care of others in need. But something happens where he is thrown into dangerous situation. He recruits his friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, to become a crime fighting crew. I will guarantee you don¬¥t figure out who the bad guy is until it comes to that point.
This a good movie for anybody that likes a little bit of comedy with some action. It has some diverse emotion scenes where the tone and sort of emotion kind of changes throughout the movie. It also has some good mystery, like who the bad guy is who they are against, who is there friend, and who is not. This adds an element of surprise and relief when it all comes together.Big Hero 6 has a lot of ups and downs when it comes to emotions. It can go from extremely sad, to really funny, and really heart-warming for some people. An example of the emotions changing throughout the movie is when Hiro is very mad with his team and turns Baymax into a weapon that hurts people instead of what he was made to do; help everyone. Baymax has these chips that program him with a helpful personality that Hiro's brother , Tadashi, made for him. Hiro, wanting to give Baymax some self-defense, made a chip that has every form of martial arts inside of it so that Baymax can help protect and defend everybody while still keeping his original personality that keeps him from hurting anyone. In this scene Hiro gets extremely mad and frustrated so he goes to Baymax and takes out his original ¬®good¬® chip and is only left with the self-defense ¬®bad¬® chip. He then says ¬®Baymax, destroy¬® and Baymax goes on a mission to kill the bad guy without any other thought in his mind. The entire team tries to stop him before he kills the man that is considered the antagonist and eventually do but suffer a big cost on their morals and integrity.
This teaches Hiro that he was out of place and should settle this and learns that everyone can be good and he should strive to get everyone there. This is a very important moment in the movie as it is a turning point for the whole team, especially Hiro and it allows them to pursue the antagonist without any anger, vengeance, or revenge. It really brings out the emotion in anyone that watches it.Another reason to watch this movie is it's intriguing mystery and not knowing what comes next. This is important for a movie like this because it keeps the watchers guessing and actually wanting to know what happens. This is shown all throughout the movie as they try to figure out who exactly the real antagonist. The team travels all around the city trying to find an answer to all of the fighting and trying to find out who is behind it all. The whole movie is filled with twists and turns that make you think more and more about who you can trust, and who you can¬¥t.
This movie is a perfect match for anyone that likes a little mystery in a story. It gives just the right amount of hints to who it is without actually giving away them.Big Hero 6 is a great movie for all ages, from little kids to elderly people. This movie will please all. I would recommend it for people who liked really any other fantasy disney movie like Cars, Frozen, and Astro Boy which all use animated objects that keep the story rolling, but Big Hero 6 is unlike any other movie with the aspect of using robots to send a message of peace. m"
" Amusing, often quaint, animation pitched at youngsters & superhero fans.
",0.3818,0.9163,2019-03-12 00:00:00,6,"""Big Hero 6"" is somewhat of a departure from form for Disney - the crisp animation; amusing characters and rapid-fire narrative are all there, but it just doesn't 'feel' like the usual fare from the famous animation studio who are perhaps more synonymous with magical lands; ugly, ruthless villains; muscular heroes; beautiful princesses and mythical adventure stories. This is Disney attempting to branch off into superhero territory - an attempt at placing each of their eggs into a basket which is squared solely at the adolescent demographic rather than the family unit of mum and dad, brother and sister.It's difficult to put here that the film is a failure - I liked its twists and turns where, villain and would-be villain are cleverly transposed; I thought it executed its tonal shifts between action-driven fun; horror and depicting the grieving process really well, but there was something missing from it to have me think it was better than pretty good.Principally, the film's actually rather cryptic title (don't worry, it isn't a sequel - there aren't 5 other entries to see before this one!) alludes to its protagonist, who is named Hiro. Hiro is a boy-genius on the mathematical/engineering level who lives with his brother and aunt above her donut shop in a future-set city which is a (reasonably) clever amalgamation of San Francisco and Tokyo. At least, it has something resembling a Chinatown district and that huge red bridge we'd all recognise in a flash if it was shown to us.A master builder and inventor, Hiro is squandering his talents in constructing inconspicuous-looking robots for a kind of miniature robot themed 'fight-club' among the grimy backstreets of his post-modern home city. Said practice is illegal, yet he persists - a kind of automatronic Eddie Felson amongst a sea of other lowlifes and gamblers who keeps winning big off the back of a boyish grin; innocent voice and some po-faced enthusiasm which has his opponents think they can win easily.One night, he and everyone else are busted after a raid - his brother Tadashi, another scientist and inventor, reiterates that he is on thin ice. Hiro, despite possessing an obvious talent, is sniffy about it - indifferent as to following in his brother's footsteps in studying at the local university. The film provides him with one other defining characteristic: that his parents died in an off-screen accident - usually a sign that an adolescent in a film needs only one more push to completely topple over the edge.Disaster strikes when, at an open evening at said university, a fire engulfs all within its vicinity and claims the life of Hiro's brother - just as Hiro was beginning to realise what a fantastic thing it might be to study there. In order to infer just how much of an impact Hiro might have, the film has him provide a Steve Jobs-like presentation on a recent invention he concocted: millions of tiny building blocks which will forge themselves to whatever neuro-command you provide them with - something resembling what Carrie White might have been able to do with Lego. All might not be as it seems, though, when the one remaining robotic block Hiro possesses seems to want to join its brothers, despite the rest of them apparently having gone up in flames. This pushes Hiro out of his depression and onto his quest to find out if all is as it seems...Hiro is chiefly helped in his quest to discover the truth behind the fire; his brother's death and where his place is in life by a large white robot named Baymax, which was his brother's invention designed as a first aid response to medical emergencies when cries of pain are detected. In spite of being made for this purpose, the robot is somewhat cumbersome - moving slowly to shift a chair out of the way when we first see him activated, despite under the impression somebody is in need of urgent help. As a supporting character, his monosyllabic putdowns and statements at the most heightened of times are genuinely amusing; meanwhile off screen, he is no doubt shipping tens of thousands of action figures and plush toys.Where B-Max is responsible for the most important line of dialogue in the film, that of when he asks Hiro if ""...eliminating {the villain} will improve your well-being"", Hiro's other supporting acts in the form of a motley crew of young students from the university exist for less substantial reasons - forming a superhero troupe off the back of learning of Hiro's discoveries and leaping into action in a manner that seems to want to be subversive of the genre, but actually ends up being a little tacked-on.The film seems desperate to tuck into the substance behind the approaching fourth industrial revolution, dealing in the process with the co-existence of man and machine and what this signifies for the next generation as one potentially replaces the other. We witness Baymax, an otherwise passive entity enslaved to whatever programming he possesses, used to both help and harm, but nothing especially leaps out at you on the issue. I like how the film seems to encourage aspiration - going to university is construed as a good thing, not to mention the film seems to promote creative thought and imparts a number of positive messages along these lines to youngsters. The film is, however, largely a chaotic blur of colour; quips and spectacle - one that few will find particularly amusing."

Nobody's struck by a meteor or experimented upon by the government, they're all just classmates at a prestigious technical school with a very specific set of strengths and passions.

They're each decidedly human, even the cute inflatable robot whose personality is dictated by a memory card. Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph. Unfortunately, the greater plot runs a bit generic, its well-worn twists and turns telegraphed a mile away, so those quirks and design touches are leaned on quite often. It's well-made, good natured, unique in a very crowded crossroad of genres, but too complacent and vanilla with its storytelling. Given a little more ambition, a sequel could do really well."

I would never have expected in life that exactly this film could do it. It is one of the Marvelous Marvel films ever. And has revived some of the Disney tropes that have not been used since the days of Cinderella and the Jungle Book for a good reason.Probably no one is as surprised as me but all these things, all these ingredients and just these clich√©s have really promised me so that I could not get enough of this movie. Always I have the impression that time is standing still and I have discovered something new and just want to dive into this movie. I know that many things have been changed and there are some things that have nothing to do with the comic but ..
Who cares?
In space it does not look like ""Star Wars"", ""Hellboy"" is not a ""Men In Black"" and the makers of ""Starship Troopers"" never read the book. I was simply impressed, fascinated, encouraged, wanted to train, applauded and even had watery eyes at the end.Despite all these praises, unfortunately, I have to give a few criticisms:
The character relationships are resolved a bit too fast, the team is not exactly balanced and the members do not complement each other very well, it is called ""show, don't tell"" but not ""just don't tell"" and the end again is Typical Disney kitsch, but I think we would not be so over saturated with all the happy ending this movie would stand out a little better. It is a really very emotionally satisfying film that only suffers from the fact that it is between so many films that have tried the same.
But that makes it a hidden gem that I can always admire again.They say we are what we are But we don't have to be."

His motivations are always clear and he doesn't stray away from them, that's so nice to see in a movie with the target demographic of children. Baymax as a character works really well bring out emotions in Hero and the writers know how to use this very well. He also has great comedic timing, he's genuinely very funny. The relationship that builds between Hero and Baymax becomes very compelling, you really care about the situation. The other characters on the team are a lot of fun but this movie is very much about Hero. The structure of this movie is quite strange, when you think about it it can be defined in 5 acts.

Then he visits his brother's current college and see his brother's invention: An inflatable robot known to heal named ""Baymax"". Then there's a fire in the building and the brother goes to rescue a teacher--inevitably killing him in the fire, but somehow the robot survives and becomes the boy's only friend until the deceased brother's friends become his friend and they band together to become superheroes. The title refers to the friends, the kid and the robot as crime fighters. None of that was in the trailers. I was certain the title was the name of the robot.

Also, apart from the giant skyhole you've seen in every other movie finale from the past 20 years, the finale is creative, funny, well executed, and has a lot of heart.

" Delightful Adaptation of an Obscure Comic
",0.5859,0.9977,2018-03-25 00:00:00,7,"In 2014, Disney released their 54th animated feature Big Hero 6, a film adaptation of a relatively unpopular comic book series by the same name. Alongside being critically acclaimed, scoring big at the box office, and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, what people took away from the film was how Disney did something different, adapting a superhero comic into an animated feature. I myself loved this film back when it came out and even called it one of Disney's best....now I personally just find it good but a little overrated.As usual for Disney, the animation is simply breathtaking. The film is set in the fictional city San Fransokyo, a blend of San Francisco and Tokyo, and the very design of it just spills imaginative. I'm sure anyone obsessed with modern Japanese art and central Californian life will go nuts over the amount of details and buildings created for the somewhat futuristic city. Along with a city that could only be made for a comic, the characters themselves look like they were made for a comic too given their stylized and exaggerated designs. However, the true highlight of the animation are the multiple representations of robots, technology and special effects, and the animators certainly let their creative juices go to great use in crafting the multiple mechanics and graphics used for the film.That being said, the story itself is nothing all that special. It centers on robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada, who lost his brother, Tadashi, only leaving behind Tadashi's robot made with the sole purpose to aid people in need. After some shocking events catch on, Hiro transforms Baymax and his other friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred into a band of high-tech heroes. It's not hard to figure out the outcome, and most of the characters aren't all that memorable. Gogo is the tough athletic girl who's into speed, Honey Lemon is the bubbly chemist, Wasabi is the wise albeit neurotic laser enthusiast, and Fred is every stoner comic relief in the book....but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find him funny. Also, without giving much away, the reveal of the main villain is pretty obvious, although his motivations are built on vengeance from a horrible tragedy, so at least he has a decent reason for wreaking havoc.However, I will say that the relationship between Hero and Baymax is the most heartwarming aspect of the entire feature. Considering that Baymax is built to help people, it makes sense that he would help Hiro in need. Even when Hiro wants him to fight back, deep down inside Baymax knows that murder will never bring Hiro's former sibling back. It truly is touching to see the only remains of Tadashi left simply want to make Hiro move on from a horrible tragedy, as I'm sure anybody dealing with the loss of somebody could relate. Not to mention, Baymax is absolutely adorable, from his squishy design, to his subtle robot movements, to even his caring charm that would make one wish to be his patient.So in conclusion, while I don't think Big Hero 6 is quite as good as most people have made it out to be, I still deem it an entertaining and at times emotional superhero movie that's fun for the whole family. Even with a predictable plot and some two dimensional characters, there's enough fun action, humor, heart and eye popping animation that make it worth a view. Since Disney bought Marvel in 2012, people have been wondering if this film will get an installment in the MCU...well, here's their chance to do so. With a potential TV series soon to have more episodes (it's just being delayed, it hasn't been cancelled) and a rumored sequel, there's always potential for further development of this world and its characters in the future."

Some things I remember from the original oddball comic while others were less predictable. But the cast here is the main show stealer. Different heroes with their respective differences. And they all band together to fight a common threat just like the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. That's got to be a winner. And this was one of the movies that I got to see with a friend after we had a hiatus for a few years. It was one of the best signs of our relationship's comeback. And now we're back together.

To that end he updates Baymax and turns Tadashi's friends, who are now his friends, into heroes. Together they uncover the identity and motives of the thief before the final stand-off.If you think Disney animation means songs and princesses then this film will come as quite a surprise. It demonstrates that Disney can make an exciting, action packed film that isn't afraid to get quite dark at times. One might expect a murderous villain but seeing the hero go into a murderous rage was a surprise. The animation looks fantastic with amazing detail. The characters are really good; Hiro is a fine lead but it is Baymax the robot who steals the show; he is cute and funny without being twee. The supporting cast of characters are great to and their 'powers', actually hi-tech gear they have invented, are fairly original. The identity of the villain isn't exactly a surprise but his motivation is quite dark for a Disney film. The film has an ending that may reduce some viewers, children and adults alike, to tears even if we then get a 'happy ending' after. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting exciting, animated, superhero action."
" Wow.

It is the kind of movie that won't leave you space or time to yawn, this movie fully contented me. It deserved the time, and it really isn't strange for an adult to like it, it's just the layout models which give this ""childish"" look of it, while it is much more than that.8.5/10"
" A very exciting and funny adventure.
",0.8384,0.9988,2017-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Most famous computer animation studios have tackled an original superhero film. First Pixar did one with ""The Incredibles"", then DreamWorks did another with ""Megamind"", and now Disney Animation Studios has tackled the genre with ""Big Hero 6"". For those who don't know, Disney famously acquired the comic book publisher Marvel in 2009 giving them ownership¬†to many famous superheroes. The team Big Hero 6 was one of them, however the artists decide to take a risk and make a¬†loose adaptation of the heroes by making an original story and also redevelop the characters. That risk sure payed off. This movie is fantastic. It's both heartwarming and thrilling which is what I expect from an animated superhero movie.In the futuristic city of San Fransokyo (which is a combination of Tokyo and San Fransisco), fourteen year old Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) has recently graduated high school and has been participating in illegal robot¬†fights. Being a genius in robotics, his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) wants him¬†to enroll in the¬†Institute of Technology. The only way to get in, however, is to create an invention that show his talents and also impress the head of the institute,¬†Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell). After impressing him with microbots, Hiro is accepted. However, his happiness is short lived as a fire breaks out in the institute killing both Callaghan and¬†Tadashi. Weeks later, Hiro accidentally activates his late brothers healthcare robot Baymax (Scott Adsit) and also finds out a mysterious person wearing a Kabuki mask has stolen his microbots and is planning to attack. After Tadashi's friends Fred (T.J. Miller), GoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) also discover the secret, the six decide to try to take down the mysterious Kabuki mask person with high tech superhero gear which results in some of the movies thrilling moments. It may sound confusing from what I wrote, but once you watch it you'll find that it's easy to follow.The story is what I love most about this movie. Despite being a loose adaptation, the film felt very original as if the people at Disney and not Marvel created the characters. The story also had some heartwarming moments involving Hiro and Baymax. The friendship between the two is genuine and you really feel for both of them. The animation is also spectacular. The cityscape of San Fransokyo was really appealing to the eye in my opinion. It didn't look like any city I had seen in any animated movie I have seen. I also think that action is very well handed which makes the film lead to a very exciting climax. The characters are also very likable, partially Baymax. He leads to some of the films funniest and emotional moments. I think the only other animated robot character that was both funny and emotional was Wall-E. As for the other characters, they're also a lot of fun. They have very relatable personalities and also have funny moments which is what I want to see in a Disney movie.""Big Hero 6"" is not only a great family movie, it's a great superhero movie as well. With it's¬†humorous, emotional, and thrilling moments, it will probably be remembered as one of the best animated super hero movies. Considering that most superhero movies nowadays are¬†mostly Marvel and DC films, it felt refreshing to watch an original superhero film with original characters and an original story. I really enjoyed it. Also, for those Marvel fans, Stan Lee does have a cameo appearance in the film. You just have to stay after the credits to watch it."
" My review on Big Hero 6
",0.5574,0.9794,2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"This is going to be my review on A the best Disney movie in my opinion. Big Hero 6 is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion. The movie starts off with A little robot fight made by some people doing some robot fight to get lots of money. The main character Hiro has beaten the the guy that is good at mini robot fighting. Hiro & his brother got in trouble & now back home. A couple days later they went to some college like place where people can do advance science stuff & make new stuff. Hiro's brother made A robot named Baymax who is nice & recovers people who are hurt. He is one of the best characters in this movie in my opinion. We barely see inflatable robots in sci fi movies & all of this stuff. Hiro invites A little things called Micro bots that are small but million & million of them work together. But someone stole Hiro's invite & made A lot of them for himself & they are trying to figuring out all of the crimes & all of the Micro bots. Until Hiro & his friends become heroes & will defeat the villain. But i'm not really going to tell everything else because I don't want to spoil it sense they are people that haven't seen this movie. But the animation is great, the voice acting is cool, the quality runs well, everything else about this movie is fun to watch. I give this movie A 10/10. You should be proud for yourself's Disney."
" I can say this is the best animated movie I've seen this year.
",0.6369,0.9889,2017-08-20 00:00:00,9,"This animation entirely super good. I didn't boring 1 second while i was watching. Heroes very cool especially GO GO has very super cool fast wheels. I wondered how is she control that suit because she has very very very fast wheel it must be so hard. I loved Baymax, i wanted to hug it, it so fluffy and so cute.Overall you can watch this movie with your family, friends I guarantee you will love this movie."
" I really liked how they developed Hiro as character
",0.4754,0.9953,2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I gave this movie an 8 because, The movie overall was pretty good, i really liked how they developed characters especially Hiro, he was just a bot-fight guy then he started te realize how much he wanted to go to the school his brother went because the robot things were pretty interested to him! His presentation was super cool too!Baymax was by far the cutest thing I have seen this year, he was so fluffy and nice to everyone!And the Villain was just super cool, you might see him coming after the fire explosion but they hide it pretty good.Other 4 characters other than Baymax and Hiro were so fun, I actually loved Wasabi, his blades were super cool and he used them good too!Overall you can watch this movie with your family, friends and have tons of fun while watching!"
" A considerate friend called Baymax
",0.7269,0.9981,2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"Big Hero 6 offers something for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug that can be felt through the screen.Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.The cast is also fun to watch. The cast is truly dramatic, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred. It still be a great Disney movie of all time. I don't care what the critic reviews say this movie is a true masterpiece. Showing that no matter what happens in your life you need to do whats right. Also introducing the most lovable character in movie history. The basis for the movie is so unique compared to most other Disney movies.To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad.But I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think. ------Yidioo.com"
" Middling animation for Disney
",0.0,0.9939,2017-06-15 00:00:00,4,"I was eager to watch this movie because it's abundantly clear that its aesthetic is influenced by anime/manga, a genre I'm not particularly familiar with, but appreciative of the art style all the same. And on that aspect, this movie definitely delivers. It's a cute, modern-day city that combines Japanese and American elements and that has an almost accolade-worthy devotion to racial diversity. But unfortunately, pretty much every other aspect of this film is stuff that we've seen before. I know that Disney, even without the high standards set by Pixar, is capable of producing stirring and classic features to this day. I would probably be more impressed with this film if it came from Dreamworks (and truth be told, it would probably be way funnier if it had been), but coming from Disney? Nowhere near the stature of Zootopia or even Frozen, as polarizing as that movie is. I enjoy superheroes and comics, but I feel like the film was massively bogged down by predictable action sequences and a generic, clich√©d plot. The characters, while likable, are given so little time to develop that when they suddenly go into battle and are masters of acrobatics and combating bad guys, it's laughable. The stoner archetype Fred, however, was pretty funny, and Baymax had some chuckle-worthy moments too. People are lauding Baymax for giving this movie a heart, but I would argue that he was just the means to facilitate the message, for really it was Hiro's brother's legacy that lived on through Baymax that helped Hiro overcome his grief. It's touching, for sure, but frankly, Hiro's brother is just given too little screen time for the audience to truly connect to their relationship. Probably the most confusing aspect to me was the villain. At first, the movie seemed to be espousing the merits of intelligence by encouraging engagement in technology, which is great. But then by the end, mixed messages of capitalism over education are seemingly established, which, political affiliations aside, is a confusing thing to assert to young children. This is all accomplished through a bizarre and convoluted villain twist that is the exact opposite of what we were set up to believe was very obvious, which is kind of annoying because the filmmakers deliberately knew that the audience would fall for their tonal framing. But regardless, the villain's storyline comes to an unnecessary and confusing end. Hiro literally sacrifices Baymax to save the antagonist's daughter...only to have them not even get an opportunity to reconnect as he's led away to jail. But then, the movie brings back Baymax from the grave, pretty much negating any plot development or message the audience could have garnered from that scene. It's a giant mess, and the surrounding scenes just can't excuse it.I know I sound extremely negative here, but yet I still don't think this was the worst movie I've ever seen, and there's certainly more suspect and condescending media children could consume (I do think this film would mainly appeal to a young child, as its dialogue and story can be quite infantile at times). It had some humorous parts and a sincere heart, but it's just not quite enough to salvage the messy, overdone plot and underdeveloped characters. Disney can do better."
" An enjoyable, fun application of the superhero formula
",0.7351,0.9992,2017-05-10 00:00:00,7,"The superhero model gets a family-friendly animated application in ""Big Hero 6,"" the long-assumed byproduct of the Disney-Marvel partnership come to fruition. Not that these young children weren't already seeing Marvel's live-action heroes, but this way Disney- Marvel can hook them on superhero tropes at an even younger age.Older kids and adults, however, might also find the world of San Fransokyo engaging and charming. The story follows boy genius Hiro (Ryan Potter), who is wasting his potential in the underground robot-fighting scene until his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) takes him to his high-tech university and introduces him to his nerdy-but- cool friends and professor. Inspired, Hiro creates an amazing invention to gain admittance to the school, but when it's stolen and used for evil, Hiro sets out with his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax (Scott Adsit), looking for answers.Writers Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson (""Monsters University"") and Jordan Roberts roll most of the superhero origin story conventions into their reimagining of this team of lesser-known Marvel characters. Hiro is the main character who has suffered great trauma in his formative years (Batman, Spider-Man) who is a technological genius capable of building awesome robots (Iron Man ¬Ö and also Batman and Spider-Man). So the movie doesn't tackle anything new for this genre, but it does package themes of loss, friendship, family and heroism into a form that children can digest.The objective is not all that different from Disney and Pixar's 2004 collaboration ""The Incredibles,"" but the difference is ""Big Hero 6"" feels much more modern and ""The Incredibles"" more ""classical"" as far as superhero movies go. Directors Don Hall (2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") create a vibrant hybrid city in San Fransokyo and let nothing hold back the imagination. Their story is steeped in the tech-driven superhero world, and even though completely implausible, doesn't feature characters with special biological abilities (like ""The Incredibles""), only smart characters that are driven and motivated (who have really good access to tech). The soul of ""Big Hero 6,"" however, is Baymax, the tubby, inflatable robot who Hiro turns into a heroic fighting machine. With his prime directive being to care for those who are injured or unwell, Baymax has acute insight into Hiro's fluctuating feelings (in fact there's a running puberty joke in the film). He's also an unlikely hero in that he's a big softie who doesn't want to harm anyone. He's the best source of comic relief in the film too, especially compared with T.J. Miller's Fred, who is sort of the obnoxious, weird friend. To the script's credit, however, Fred has all the lines that wink to the adults in the audience about how closely this story adheres to the comic book movie formula.""Big Hero 6"" is a fun superhero adventure with a strong moral story arc. Although it throws some curveballs in terms of plot and emotions, nothing about it is all that surprising or original; it's a well-executed use of a reliable formula.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Nice but too much of everything
",0.2263,0.8854,2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"Animated mash up, inspired by a lot of superhero movies and Japanese anime: Marvel's Avengers, Power Rangers, Transformers, The Incredibles. ""Baymax"" is not a bad movie - it's kinda funny, entertaining, with a lot of action and a nice cameo at the very end of it. My biggest problem - everything is extra large: the emotions, the characters (all social stereotypes), the story and her morality."
" The Man in the High Castle the later years
",0.0,0.97,2017-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Real rating: 6.7/10 The intentions of the writers might not have been to link to K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle, but a Japanese controlled San Francisco is bound to invite that comparison. Which gives the film a horrendous back story that it never intended, but still infiltrates the viewers mind. Could they not have kept them in Japan like in the comics? That said the animation team should be patting themselves on the back, this is a masterclass in human emotion and natural movements which most animated films still have yet to get right two years later. Which if one were to view solely for the animation then yes it was deserving of its Oscar. However if we take the writing into account, then this is a clich√© within a clich√© that leads to a point where the villain gets rewarded for his endeavours, while the good guys might save the day, they are the one's who ultimately lost more. The work was predictable as predictable gets and one could see everything before it happened, so if you are a future animation student watch and enjoy, if you are anyone else, then it is average at best."

His name is Baymax, Baymax is invented by Hiro's brother. He can help you to cure disease and check your or not. Moreover, he can make his host happy. He is like a child when he can't understand something. Also, he is like a friend. He can do anything, whatever his host ask to do.I really love this movie.

" Has its ups, and its downs.
",0.0,0.9062,2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Big hero 6 is set in a combined setting to Tokyo meets San Francisco. The protagonist; Hiro, is built from a clich√© foundation; a broken family and questions to his lineage. It ends on a similarly clich√© tone; where the good prevail. The excitement is mild, the antagonist has a flawed motive, and the animation is not anything unseen before. Whilst there are pleasant motives, and it is by far not an abysmal debacle, it leaves much to be desired and has no memorable soundtrack or moments. Big Hero 6 misses the mark it's larger iconic predecessors have set. Maybe its directors; Don Hall and Chris Williams, should stick to their strengths; writing."

Honestly, this would have been a tremendously better film if they didn't shoehorn it into a team superhero film. I know the Avengers and upcoming DC BS was all the rage just before they came up with this movie but just because it worked for something else doesn't mean it is going to work for you. So long-story short, this would have been a classic if they just kept it the bot and the boy. The film is about a young tech- head who lost is brother but found his robot and became part of a superhero team in a very rushed fashion to get the bad guy using his tech. Don't get me wrong, I like the film but it could have been, should have been better."
" excellent incorporation of advanced technology

The technology these guys have, and the brains to use it, is insane. A telling foreshadowing of what future San Francisco/Tokyo might look like, a microcosm of a society run by technology and its continual advancement.Soundtrack by Henry Jackman, the same guy who did X-Men and Captain America. Suits the setting well, and you'll love the main single ""Immortals"" by Fall Out Boy.The animation is crazy; as I saw with Zootopia, I could see how much Disney has improved since Snow White back in 1937. Some pretty nice fight sequences with the heroes' upgrades, and damn! the attention to detail is exquisite. Every scene and shot is SO detailed, down to the last sprocket.Unlike most modern Disney films, this one didn't really feature the theme(s) of following your dreams and/or forging your own identity. It's a hero story, and this is indeed Disney's first time adapting Marvel Comics material. (Disney bought Marvel, after all.) I liked the message of helping others and doing what is right, as exemplified by the robot Baymax. The theme of friendship and sticking together. Of revenge. (Just kidding.) Anyways, I certainly didn't regret watching this past midnight. I can always expect the best from Disney."
