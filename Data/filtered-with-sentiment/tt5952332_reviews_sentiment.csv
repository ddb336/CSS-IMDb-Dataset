" Watch to think and reflect, not to get any answers
",0.0,0.9687,2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,"I think it's a really interesting documentary, although I'd say it's lacking something. I guess I've to reluctantly agree that it's biased, if you're asking yourself the question if Amanda is innocent or guilty. Personally I believe it could be both. It's hard to find out what happened and all we can do now is theorize. The thing is this is and was a good story, and honestly if they did it I'm pretty sure they have gotten their punishment. I'm not someone who believes in prisons, and four years is a long time. I would have loved to see more of Meredith and Amanda's life in Italy, seeing their friends. We did get some, but it would have been great to explore that more. But does it really matter if they are guilty or innocent, isn't it more interesting to use this to reflect over this society? Tragedies makes for great stories."
" Stick To The Truth
",0.3182,-0.9545,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"I knew nothing about this and was actually expecting a bigger story. It's hard to sympathize for suspects who change their stories and pass the blame, it's happened many times in cases. I almost at some point just say to myself ""lock them up for saying stupid confusing confessions!"" But, I am aware that law enforcement can use this public perception to their advantage and use time and words to mess with the suspects. For future suspects of crime - speak the truth and stick to it no matter how ridiculous or embarrassing it may be.The media guy was a joke, it's his duty to ensure his sources and info are legit."
" A sad and pathetic attempt at redeeming Knox
",-0.7783,-0.9977,2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,"I watched this after seeing it in my Netflix recommendations and I'm hoping that many more will watch it so that the victim's case (the only victim in this entire saga, Meredith Kercher) can be reopened and further scrutinized.This doc does a good job of attempting to convince of you of Amanda's innocence by leaving out crucial and damning details in the case. I even felt angry on Amanda's behalf due to the blatant sexist treatment the media subjected her to (which I still agree, was problematic and unfairly focused on her sexuality). But then I dug a little and discovered everything else that this documentary conveniently overlooks.I encourage anyone who watches this to please do just a cursory search of the HARD evidence and witness/police testimonies surrounding Meredith's murder: it's damning and overwhelmingly obvious that Amanda and Raffaele were involved, if not active planners.Forget her strange, apathetic behavior after discovering her roommate had been bludgeoned to death (the infamous kiss, the splits and cartwheels at the police station). Forget all of that.
.
It's the repeated lies about their whereabouts (their phones and computer were shut off/inactive between evening-time and early morning on the night of the murder, whereas they claim they spent their evening at his home watching a movie).It's the framing of her boss, the poor bar owner, who spent 2 weeks in jail until a customer saved him by providing him with a solid alibi (Amanda has never recanted her accusation).It's the traces of DNA of Amanda's and Raffaele's found throughout the apartment, including mixed blood, a bloody footprint, and his DNA in her bra clasp (fyi, DNA transfer doesn't happen that easily so it's unlikely that it ended up in such a tiny and intimate article of clothing by ""accident"" or negligence).It's the knife they found in Raffaele's apartment, and a scant amount of Meredith's DNA they found on the blade, to which he responded by lying that he pricked her by accident when she came over for dinner once. Meredith has never been to his house...why come up with such a blatant lie?Other suspicious behaviors: not calling the police first thing when she discovers their home has been ""broken into;"" neither of them going to Meredith's vigil; Staying calm the entire time following the murder but freaking out when the police ask you to identify any missing knives in your kitchen or when they ask you for prints, as they did to the other roommates; telling police that the house was broken into but nothing was stolen (how would you know?).These are only some details among many.With book sales, a biased Netflix doc and a podcast on True Crime, Amanda sure is capitalizing on a past that she claims to so desperately want to escape. Check out the photo of her wedding announcement where she jokes about wearing her prison PJs and her crowdsourcing campaign to pay for her wedding. How about compensation to the man who lost his bar and livelihood when you wrongfully accused him of murder? Or Kercher's family, who will continuously be reminded of the brutality their daughter endured every time they see your face and read about your undeserved success, and lies about being exonerated (Amanda was NEVER exonerated, the courts just didn't have enough evidence to convict her; they still believe that her and R were involved and present during the murder).There are many REAL victims of a flawed justice system who have actually been wrongfully convicted - we know this because there has been evidence that attests to this beyond a reasonable doubt. Amanda Knox is not one of them."
" Looks guilty to me
",-0.4215,-0.8941,2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,The creators of this documentary wanted Amanda to look innocent. I've never heard of this case before but the expressions of her face creeped me out! No real emotions what so ever. The other thing that really annoyed me is that she's been judged because she was sexually active! What the hell? Is this 1800 or 2007?
" WELL CRAFTED DOCUMENTARY, BUT A TO-BE-DEFINED TRUTH
",0.5423,0.9081,2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"If this documentary is to be judged from a cinematographic point of view, then it is a product that is worthwhile, that is told well, perfectly articulated -despite it has been focused on some aspects, excluding many others, such as the psychological one- and easily understandanble that there is a study, a professionalism and a good way of ""talking"" about facts behind it. From the point of view of the truth, guilt or innocence, an human being lives under the clear blue sky and only those who reside above the mere existence,perceptions and sins of this being, be it God or anyone else, will be the latter to judge and punish those who took the life of innocents, such as the life of a 21-year-old girl, Meredith Kercher. Well crafted documetary, so vote-7 to the documentary, but a TBD-vote for the truth."
" My Perspective Sees An Ineffective Detective
",-0.128,-0.9852,2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Wow I am blown away by how bad this entire investigation was handled and how poor of a job that the investigator did by having blinders on and only looking at this ""sex crazed woman"" who he thinks that she raped and killed her roommate and somehow talked two men into taking part in the murder and then to have this ""journalist"" turn around and say how bad the cops screwed up the case only after he had personally wrote these sensationalized stories about Mrs Knox's sex life which even if he didn't mean to, his stories absolutely did sway the public's view as to her guilt even before the trial started.. I've read a few reviews saying that this is the Amanda Knox propaganda machine at work which might be true but from what I've seen there is no evidence pointing to Knox being guilty and had the detective spent less time focusing on her sex life and more time finding clues the day of the crime and not 46 days later (finding the bra strap) then we might have never even heard of the Amanda Knox murder trial..
One thing I've noticed about detectives and DA's is that whenever their found to have been chasing the wrong person they're never the type to offer an apology to the wrongly accused and unfortunately sometimes it's the wrongly convicted..
Thank God this wasn't one of those 20+ years later the truth comes out but even a day behind bars for an innocent person has to be hard and being wrongly convicted would really really suck.."
" A very average documentary
",0.0,0.6894,2021-01-18 00:00:00,5,"486 / 1024
One of the few documentaries where we have the opportunity to meet the Defendants themselves. For an hour and a half we learn nothing Surprising about the story itself. I have the impression that the documentary was made a little bit by force. On the one hand, the protagonist tries to put all the blame on police ineptitude. On the other hand, she can't quite explain hers actions. Very average and short for a Netflix documentary. I think there is a lot of detail and detail missing."
" 5
",0.0,-0.9651,2021-01-14 00:00:00,5,"One of the worst documentaries that I've seen. If we look from evidences there are lack of them( at least shown in this documentary). DNA on kitchen knife... How this can be even evidence of something, there was no blood found. Another evidence text message with good night. Huh? They making sexual image of Amanda to say she could kill someone, come on. That can't be serious. The problem is that this documentary doesn't show all the proves and interviews just part of it and saying look she's innocent. After watching this documentary I didn't get anything. Is she guilty or no? I don't know, it's the same as I didn't watch anything. Pretty useless documentary."
" MISLEADING
",-0.4019,0.4767,2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,"This is nothing but a PR stunt put out to make Knox look innocent. The whole of Italy and the UK know what shevdid, don't believe a word of this tripe."

" Too biased for my taste.
",-0.2732,-0.9194,2020-11-14 00:00:00,1,"I didn't know enough about the case going in to notice right away how biased the documentary is. If it wasn't because I instinctively distrusted and disliked Amanda Knox, I wouldn't know about everything they left out of the documentary. Which is enough to inspire reasonable doubt on Amanda and Raffaele.Even though they try to make you think they're unbiased, they made the documentary in such a way that the strongest conclusion based on the information they've provided is that Amanda and Raffaele are innocent. They left out or brushed past a ton of details that could be considered deeper. Why? Because those things would make Amanda and Raffaele suspicious in the mind of the viewer.That, to me, is not a good documentary. I don't appreciate it when documentary-makers try to influence my opinion one way or another. Especially when it comes to criminal cases because I can't stand the idea of people feeling sympathy for someone who is or could be guilty of something awful.I also don't like it when they keep information from me or dismiss it quickly and believe I won't notice or care. I particularly hate it when they swear they are unbiased and yet the last thing they want to do is explore the facts as they are.That's not to say I believe they are guilty simply because I don't trust them. But there's certainly room for a lot more doubt and suspicion than we're lead to believe with this documentary."
" Not a good documentary!
",-0.4015,-0.9631,2020-10-19 00:00:00,5,"I have no opinion on Amanda Knox. I wasn't watching it thinking she was guilty or innocent. I was just trying to understand the chain of events and evidence. As an impartial viewer I found this documentary to be very flawed! First of all, there's little attention to the murder victim. Second, we don't get the full picture! To understand what happened there we need to know who was the victim, what was her relationship with the suspects, what was the suspects behaviour after the murder, what physical evidence did the police find in the crime scene, how was the investigation going, what did the suspects say etc. It's not that the film doesn't address any of these questions it's that they pick and choose on what to focus on and we don't get a clear picture of what really happened. And just to clarify, I don't mean what happened to the victim. That we can never really know, what I mean is what happened after the murder. The conclusion of the film is that the investigation was a big mess but my own conclusion is that the film is even messier. A good documentary should be objective and give the viewers a full picture of what happened. Some reviewers mentioned it's a PR film, not a documentary but if it's true and the point was to show Amanda was innocent, I think they failed at that too. After an hour and a half of watching it, I still have no opinion on her guilt. Maybe she did it and maybe she didn't. The only opinion I have is that this film is not really worth watching."

" Total BS
",0.0,-0.9352,2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,"Biased ""documentary"". The makers left out some crucial info and clearly picked Amanda's side of the story ignoring compelling evidence that shows at least that she has been lying about what happened that day even from the beginning. That is not the reason I give this terrible show 2stars but the fact that the makers never commemorated Meredith. Amanda herself does the same which shows how cold hearted she is. It was her room-mate for god sake!!!!! How can you talked about her dead like that with no emotion and no respect. Only a psychopath can react like this to something as horrifying and sad as Merediths murder..."
" Interesting
",0.4019,0.3883,2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"It is interesting to see how the media and journalists have reported false information and inflamed the public, but still exempt themselves from guilt. The journalist who was interviewed appears to have neither a sensitivity to the victim, nor to the accused falsely. And it is ridiculous how Americans want to intervene in everything, as if everyone depends on them. How superb."
" SO biased towards Knox (& cruelly indifferent to the real victim) that it must be a PR-dream
",-0.8283,0.9336,2020-10-02 00:00:00,4,"I'd surprised by other comments here that she is some leftist cause célèbre - I am extremely liberal and I cannot stand this girl, her narcissism, her wealthy defense team and obvious PR crew - and I was VERY disappointed they did the actual VICTIM, Meredith, much attention at all. Amanda Knox is no hero, perhaps ppl find her attractive and cannot reconcile that with what she seems very obviously to have done.
A less biased, less Amanda Knox-centered narrative would have been very interesting.
I, for one, will NEVER forget her being in the police station regarding her murdered roommate and turning CARTWHEELS. I cd've been convinced either way as to her role - but I found this Very Knox-centered (and 'poor-me attitude') along with the lack of compassion for the true victim extremely off-putting. A good documentary is unbiased and searching for the truth. This was honestly like a PR film from Amanda's wealthy & popular support system. A girl was MURDERED. She deserves more focus, more explanation as to Knox doing cartwheels in the police station while ""finding out"" or even processing that your roommate was MURDERED- and I felt it was Off The whole time, only to learn that it really was set up by Knox's team. If she is looking for sympathy - it just illuminates her narcissism & perhaps sociopathy. So little respect given to the girl who ACTUALLY DIED - in a terrible way.
I hadn't seen much compassion from Knox in small interviews before, but this film shows that she wasn't just reacting oddly, as many ppl do to a traumatic event, but that she truly is THAT self-centered, narcissistic, & sociopathic at the very least.
For a PR stunt, I hope more ppl see past her average-to-pretty face and see her for what she IS."
" Very Good Knox Doc
",0.4927,-0.5927,2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"AK is a fascinating character and looks amazing onscreen. She expresses herself in an interesting way. Never for an instant did this viewer doubt that Guede was the sole guilty party, but that could have been the intention. An excellent documentary of a horrifying story that seems to have been stolen from the plot of a novel from a spinning rack. It would have been better if the filmmakers had been able to show us more about the actual murderer and about Kercher, the victim."
" Plays more with sympathies and emotions.
",0.25,-0.1254,2020-06-15 00:00:00,7,"Ok, it turns the interest to this case.But the documentary is nothing to base an opinion upon. Of course it is interesting to see how the world sees this case (we have never left medieval...), feelings.
What hit me most was the interrogation. It reminded me of ""In the name of the Father"".So, I searched for more information and found the book of Douglas Preston, ""The forgotten killer"". In this book, it is the analysis of John Douglas which seems most analytic and believable. At least plausible and rational, based on the data given. So, I believe that Rafaelle and Amanda are innocent of this crime and that it was a burglary gone wrong. But more than that I feel deeply sorry for the family of Meredith and all families who have been violantly robbed of their children."

Would you be composed or crack under pressure telling the police what they want to hear? or anything at all to be left alone?Humans are so easy to judge others! Where is the compassion? where is the benefit of a doubt? What's her motive? Her life ruined by media frenzy and some amateur police work in Italy.If you want to have a different perspective on this, read Malcolm Gladwell's ""Talking to Strangers"", he discusses this case a lot.

I would have given this documentary an 8 or 9 out of 10 if it weren't for just how biased this documentary is. There are many great reviews on here which detail exactly what was left out. In addition, there are excellent websites which discuss even minor points at length. If you only watch this documentary, you may easily be convinced of Amanda's 100% innocence based on this documentary's narrow selection of facts.Nonetheless, I think many of the outside websites and negative reviews are just as certain about Knox's guilt as this documentary is certain that she is innocent. Unfortunately there are no smoking guns when it comes to this case, except for the African, Guede who was rightly convicted of murder. While he may not have done it alone (but it is possible he did), it doesn't necessarily mean he had to have committed the crime with Knox and her boyfriend. It's more likely that he committed the crime with another accomplice, who is now walking free."

The behaviour of Knox following the murder was appalling - kissing & cuddling her boyfriend outside the house, doing stretches in the police waiting room, singing to herself. At no time did she seem upset for her dead friend, or traumatised when told that Meredith's throat had been brutally slashed. She was only worried about herself.
Very sad indeed, I feel so much pain and sorrow for Meredith's family having to even know of such an awful show being made as 'entertainment' for others. I couldn't watch it any further, had to turn it off."

She was subsequnetly convicted of murder amid lurid press coverage. However, the DNA evidence was weak and (on the basis of this movie) the chief prosecutor was something of a fantastist, with a worrying tendency to infer beyond the evidence. Knox appealed; the American press took up her case, ridiculing Italian justice and making a defence of the investigation, ironically, a point of patriotism for some Italians. In the end, Knox was exonnerated, and if this documentary is to be believed, this was the correct verdict. The film features a self-incriminating interview with muck-raking journalist Nick Pisa, a man who seems utterly unwilling to accept that his job carries any level of moral responsibility. Otherwise, it's basically a very sad story, made worse by the years it took to reach the legal conclusion."

My rating on this started out okay-ish, and quickly went down the rating scale the more I started reading about this, so much so that I had to write my first review.Where is all the other evidence that they found? Where is the very strange comments she made about the murder (and quickly tried to cover up)? Where is the actual ""odd"" behavior she showed when she was being led to be finger printed? Where is the actual telephone records and timelines? Where is the accounts of the eyewitnesses who saw them the night of and the morning after?

" It leaves me questioning .....

Is it really that Italian police's style of investigating could lead to suspects pouring out false details and then correct them back and forth? Are they really that stupid and backward? Jeez, I think this is the case of the century, really! Human deception at its best."

" Divisive, intriguing true crime story
",-0.1779,-0.9301,2019-05-14 00:00:00,9,"The Amanda Knox story is, historically, a very divisive crime story, and the public opinion that has become enveloped in the ""truth"" has evolved to relatively toxic sides. Either you think she is innocent, or she is guilty. But as one of the first lines spoken in this masterful documentary presents, from Knox herself: Either she is a psychopath in sheep's clothing, or she is you. And both are equally terrifying. This incredible dichotomy of a revelation is expertly told and discovered in the Netflix-original documentary, that is engrossing to the last second. The editing, the cinematography, and the interviews of some of the key players of the crime are all must-sees."
" A documentary about the case that became an international sensation
",0.0,0.9849,2019-04-03 00:00:00,7,"This was an interesting documentary but of course it doesn't tell it all. Would also be hard to out every detail of the story that as dragged for 8 years into 1.5 hours. I think it pretty much does a good job. There are interviews with several people including the investigator and the journalist.Does one feel after that Amanda and Raffaele are innocent? Yes, but they were also acquitted for pretty much the same reasons. Time for the haters to finally give it up. And one thing that was omitted was the fact that Rudy was becoming a more aggressive burglar and threatened a women in his last one with a knife. E everything kind of points to him and trying to add Amanda and Raffaele into it is kind of crazy. Even Rudy said at first Amanda wasn't there, he changed what he said when it came to real questioning by the police.People say she acted weird after Meredith's death. I don't see it. Not everyone upset cries. She was shocked and looked for comfort in her boyfriend who was there. She didn't grieve enough and cared for herself. well she knew Meredith for 2 weeks. Sure she was upset but her worry about the accusations was bigger.I did like the comment of the Italian lawyer that in 1308 Italy had their first law school while in America they were painting bisons on the cave walls. True. But to be fair it wasn't America then. It became America a bit later when people from countries with law schools came over. But this doesn't have much to do with Amanda Knox.I am glad her and Raffaele can finally live in peace."
" Did not address Amanda Knox's Lies
",-0.4215,-0.9682,2019-03-28 00:00:00,1,"It is unfortunate that this documentary does not present all of the crucial evidence in the case. It seems to focus on vilifying Nick Pisa and the prosecutor Mignini.
The fact is that Nick Pisa's reporting did not affect the multiple judges' decision to convict Knox of murder twice.
It also was very biased in presenting Mignini. To present him as a man who was a fanatic, influenced by his Catholic faith is absolutely absurd. If you read any of the court transcripts, you will see that he is extremely adept at uncovering Amanda Knox's lies, conflicting alibis and supposed memory failures. He was not the only prosecutor in this case.
The fact that Amanda took part in this so called ""documentary"" should be a warning. She and her parents have never given an interview without being guaranteed softball questions. None of her lies, and there were hundreds in her book alone, to the police and during the trial, were addressed."

In watching this documentary that slanted towards innocence as opposed to previously viewed accounts where facts differed slightly but interpretation relied heavily on the debatable science of body language. Upon seeing varying conclusions, I was convinced it f one thing above all else ... reasonable doubt.The anger reminded me of the Casey Anthony trial where I agreed with the jury who had the guts to follow the judges instructions as in how to weigh experts' testimony that conflicted within the prosecution's case. Now Jodi arias there's a case where I was enraged by the hung jury in the penalty phase. Because there I saw no reasonable doubt no remorse and a level of dishonesty that lacked all decency."

Apparently some right wing news site sent a lot of people over here to write horrible reviews about this great documentary, even though critical reception has been universally and unanimously terrific. This really shows how the media can shape a story based on their own desire for ratings and sales, not reaching the truth. The fact that the judge, who believes satanic cults were roaming the countryside, was allowed to use his bias and superstitious beliefs to so taint this case, show how this case was doomed for the defense from the start, at least until just this was finally served in Amanda Knox was freed from prison. Those who have written here that the Catholic Church is incapable of having a member do something evil, I suggest you watch the movie Spotlight, now showing here on Netflix. A must for true crime fans."

Oh wow let's also check out how the journalist reporting the murder back then decided to framed their story and why and how they made that decision, what was their impression on the girl and what title he used for their story, and the reception of these stories, Front Page!? wow, SO INTERESTING.
Damn the protagonist must be devastated after being suspected of murder, wow cool im glad you asked, let's start with her childhood, her personality when she was little and then older, her family's opinion on her, her reasons for study abroad, her adventures in Italy before the murder happened, oh do you know he met this totally handsome boy that they started dating? here's their pictures, videos, etc...so interesti....FFS, get on wtih the freaking point.

The fact that the producers were advocates of her innocence since 2011 should also show their bias."
" A review of the documentary, not the Verdict
",-0.1139,0.9163,2018-09-10 00:00:00,8,"I've read a number of negative reviews, all because they don't agree with the verdict and therefore the documentary didn't give them the answers they wanted to hear. Quite a few of the 1/10 and 2/10 reviews on here should be taken with a pinch of salt for that reason. Firstly this isn't a documentary that will go on to become a classic, neither will be on a must see documentary list in 10 years time. It does focus on two very important aspects, flaws in the police investigation and also the media involvement with often sensationalist reporting. It shows how the legal system can almost breakdown when policing and reporting isn't done to a high standard. It's not just a matter of ""who done it"" anymore.The documentary does a great job of portraying the police opinion from the outset, that Amanda Knox was guilty, even before they had evidence. The second aspect of this is the DNA evidence and how it impacted the verdicts and acquittals. It gives a real insight into why DNA evidence can fall apart. It reminded me a little of making a murderer for this reason and the case focus on DNA. The media coverage and commentary by the Daily Mail journalist was also really interesting. Throughout it demonstrated just how important their sensational headlines changed public opinion of the case. The documentary itself does a fine job of presenting the evidence. The issue is how it follows Knox and at times becomes a soapbox for her fame. I think it could have been a little more tasteful when interviewing her, maybe giving her less screen time was the answer.Overall a great watch for anyone who loves crime documentaries. It shows how policing efficiency and the media in today's world can transform cases."
" Absolutely terrible.
",-0.5256,0.3612,2018-08-28 00:00:00,2,"Thanks to Nick Pisa, this documentary is unwatchable. 
It's a documentary on people's ego. Nothing to do with pure real trustworthy journalism. It's just a bunch of useless POV and close to no information at all. 
Everyone's a diva in this documentary. 
Get two stars for the cinematography."
" Looked guilty as hell
",-0.8126,0.7995,2018-08-19 00:00:00,1,"It's an interesting documentary in that it makes Knox look guilty as hell even though it's apparently produced by some ardent Knox supporters, an important detail that I only found out later. We see her laughter grimaces the sociopaths make when they lie all over the movie - really bad way to try to make someone appear innocent. Gotta love the Italian lawyer's comments when asked about the US: in 1308 we had our first law school in Italy; in 1308 in America they were drawing bisons in caves. Much as I appreciate the USA, there's nothing like mocking an adolescent nation at the right time."
" True Criminals
",-0.2263,0.9176,2018-06-25 00:00:00,5,"First of all, people, a documentary doesn't present both sides. Documentaries are the media equivalent of a debate argument or a persuasive essay. A documentary presents a claim and then supports it with information. Documentaries are biased by design.For unbiased information, we are supposed to look to the news and journalists. Within the first few minutes of this film, we can see that trust is misplaced. The ""journalist"" recorded here appears truly deplorable. It is clear the media smeared Knox by printing every fabricated or insinuated tale as though it were fact. Foxy Knoxy? Lucifer-like, satanic witch? Yeah, that's evenhanded journalism assuring a fair trial. *scoff*Drug-fueled sex orgy? Because they smoked a little weed? Puh-leeeease.The investigator comes off as a pompous ass. Knox is an anarchist because she doesn't like being questioned by authorities? Pretty sure only the truly stupid are cooperative when they have been accused of murder.I'm dumbfounded by the people screaming for Knox's head based upon the ""damning"" physical evidence. You mean they found Knox's DNA and fingerprints in her own home? Wow, what a revelation! Listen, your DNA and fingerprints cover just about every square inch of your residence, including the bedroom of anyone living with you. Skin and hair are everywhere (that's what dust is mostly made of), and don't tell me you never hung out in your roommate's room listening to music, chatting, or smoking a bowl.Knox was acquitted. That means she is presumed innocent. End of story."
" Police work and journalism of today, awful and amateurish!
",-0.5093,-0.9486,2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Wtf...that was my first thought when I saw the journalist describing the scenario like it was book of fiction or something. Even if he was satisfied with getting the scoop...a normal (emotional) person wouldn't laugh and in the same time describe it like a perfect ""media-story"". He seems to be an awful human being...!...and a bad journalist admitting he wrote articles in the case without doing any background check...just like many others do in social media today. A young girl died and that laugh, that was the most disturbing in this documentary!It was good that the chaos at the crime scene was recorded, that was enough to realize how non-professional the police was. And the the evidence they found after 48 day...wtf again...really!?!A good example of bad police work and how awful media can be...shame on both police and media!"
" A Stylish and Haunting Documentary That Unfortunately Requires Further Investigation From the Viewer (positive review from someone certain of Knox's guilt)
",-0.34,0.9943,2017-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Let me put it this way. I had little to no knowledge regarding this case before watching the film, and it still left me strongly convinced of Knox's guilt. It gave me the feeling that it wasn't telling us everything, but I didn't know or get the impression that the filmmakers thought she was innocent, and were trying to portray her as such. Like already mentioned, I knew next to nothing about the case and I was still very easily convinced that Knox had at least some form of involvement. I found out after watching it that the directors think she's innocent. The problem is the film leaves out multiple pieces of incriminating evidence, yet has convinced some people that Knox is innocent. The film claims itself to be neutral, and for a while it is. But it eventually puts too much emphasis on a supposed lack of Knox's DNA found in Kercher's room, and leaves out forms of DNA evidence against both of them, a number of different testimonies from the night of the murder and the following morning, as well as many other things INCLUDING what I think might be the strongest piece of evidence against Knox and Sollecito; what happened when authorities first arrived to the crime scene. The film makes it look like they phoned authorities who then quickly arrived, and then the odd behavior began with Knox and Sollecito noticeably expressing a suspicious amount of affection towards each other directly outside the murder scene. But clear reasoning to suspect Knox's guilt actually started even before that. The postal police ironically arrived first, due to having found both of Kercher's phones. Knox and Sollecito then show no concern for Meredith's safety and make no mention of her door being locked. Eventually Knox claims that it was normal for Kercher to leave her door locked, which has been refuted by all of the other roommates. Now, that may not seem like much at first, but think about what her story is. She claims that before phoning police and anyone else arriving, she began to panic, knocked multiple times on Kercher's door, eventually climbing the balcony to try to see into her window, and even getting Sollecito to try to kick the door down. So we're trying as hard as possible to peak into windows and bust the door down to make sure she's okay, but when authorities suddenly arrive due to finding her phones in a random backyard, they don't freak the hell out? Or even mention her door being locked?! It was mentioned in the phone call! The phone call to police that oddly did not happen until after the postal police had arrived. They claimed otherwise, but the full timeline for that morning has been established based on several different testimonies and phone records.If they were innocent, there's no doubt that they would have instantly entered a stronger state of panic when realizing her phones had been ditched, and directed the postal police's attention to the locked door. Instead, Knox diverts their attention away from the door after it's discovered to be locked, with the flat-out lie that Kercher commonly left it that way. Everybody else claims that she had never once left her door locked before. You may ask, well why would Amanda do this? It's pretty simple. Cold feet. Authorities arrived even quicker than they had planned, before they phoned them themselves, and reality set in. Knox got nervous and wasn't ready for authorities to find the body, so she tried to buy more time and shift their attention away from her room. Unlike a lot of users who are convinced of Knox's guilt, I would still recommend the film. It really upsets me that it has convinced people that she's innocent, but due to the scale of her role, believing Knox is guilty makes it an even creepier and more memorably haunting experience. Imagine how amazing of a documentary this would have been if it had actually been a neutral exploration that presented allllll of the significant evidence and allowed the viewer to decide on their own. It feels like a rare opportunity to make a documentary that very largely features new interviews from two people convicted twice of murder (that many people still believe are guilty). Their footage should have given everyone that haunting, at least suspicious sensation that it gave me, but I see now how the filmmakers irresponsibly structured the film to have you ultimately be on their side and feel sympathy for them. I'd still recommend it. It's creepy, gorgeous, and quite thought-provoking in many aspects. But I stress that you go to themurderofmeredithkercher.com afterwards and read into all of the evidence. Knowing what the film leaves out, makes it more enjoyable and less enjoyable at the same time. I don't know why the directors are convinced of Knox's innocence, but there is significantly more to the case than what the film shows. And that is an understatement. With all things considered, the idea that Knox and Sollecito had zero involvement is absolute insanity. Unsavory qualities you may see in a journalist or detective are irrelevant. Yes, the media acted ridiculous. I don't disagree. But at the end of the day, that really changes none of the hard evidence. Ultimately, a technically proficient documentary that exploits very interesting and personal aspects, but without giving you the whole story. It's cool that Knox is in it, but all forms of significantly incriminating evidence against her and Sollecito still should have been provided, and that clearly isn't what they did. It still serves as an essential fact that Guede did not act alone and that a lot of evidence (including eye-witness testimonies that the film excludes) points to three people being involved. I would love to know who the directors think the other two are."
" Captivating and quite disturbing
",-0.5563,-0.9464,2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"I watched this completely spontaneously yesterday, without knowing what precisely it was about. Expecting nothing special, I can now say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Aside from what seemed to me a very on- the-nose way of building up tension at the beginning that had me rolling my eyes a bit (I expect someone who knows even a bit about the case would react very differently), this is a very solid documentary.As I see it, the most interesting aspects of this story are not the intricacies of the murder case itself- the collection and interpretation of clues and such. It quickly becomes more about how the media reacts to an ""exotic"" case (or is trying its hardest to make it exotic) like this and how it impacts the workings of a possibly incompetent police- and justice-system. I believe this was the decided intention of the makers of this documentary: They manage to pretty elegantly blend the human angle (the immediate experience of those involved in the case), the 'mystery angle' (uncovering what actually happened) and the bigger picture of how hyperbolic, borderline insane reporting on a case can shift the public opinion and potentially derail investigations in a very real way. The cinematography and editing are also excellently executed - the shots are stylish, but also convey information relevant to what's going on (as opposed to being vacuously flashy, as I've often seen in crime-related documentaries).Regarding the 1-star reviews (this may contain a few ""spoilers""): I'm glad I didn't decide to not watch the film because of the many angry negative reviews here on IMDb. A cursory reading of most of them makes apparent that the criticism isn't really focused on the craftsmanship or the entertainment-value of this documentary but rather on a bias the filmmakers may or may not have towards displaying the titular Amanda Knox in a much more positive light than she deserves. If this really were the case, it would constitute a valid criticism, given that this is a documentary. But from what I've read the accusations made in these reviews are far from substantial and most of the people making them seem to have been deeply emotionally caught up in this case for years and obviously made up their mind a long time ago. For example, I've read multiple times that the documentary supposedly withheld ""important"" information, like the captioning of a myspace photo of Amanda holding a gun with the words ""The Nazi Inside"", or that the she once uploaded a short story of a woman getting raped, somewhere online. These reviewers apparently believe that this is damming evidence of her being a murderous sociopath. I'm baffled by this reasoning - it implies that every edgy teen on 4chan or reddit is an enormous danger to society.Regardless - even if after watching the documentary you are not convinced of Knox' innocence, the repeated revisions of the verdicts made by the Italian courts plainly show that this case was handled extremely incompetently, which in and of itself is worthy of reflection and discussion. I will concede that the way some people, especially Italian investigators and lawyers, were presented made them look like morons, or at least somewhat misguided - but I'm not sure how much of this can be attributed to the makers of the documentary trying to paint a false picture. I had the impression that what I got was a somewhat exaggerated, but essentially real picture of who these characters were.Anyways, a documentary well worth your time, especially as it brutally demonstrates the irrational malleability of public opinion - and this is true whether you consider Amanda guilty or not after having seen it.Edit: The reviews here are obviously being brigaded by people who dislike this film with a passion. Very detailed and well written positive reviews (not necessarily mine) that gave the movie a score of seven or higher have been overwhelmingly declared ""not helpful"" in spite of the movie having a pretty high rating here."
" Read the Up On The Case
",0.0,-0.9615,2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"First of all, to those who say it is disrespectful to the victim, you might be right. Then again you could say that about all true crime documentaries. The ultimate verdict on this depends on whether you think she is guilty or innocent. If she is guilty it would be celebrating a psychopath, If she is innocent her name deserves to be cleared and this documentary can help with that. I read up on the case before I watched this and I made up my mind. I think she is innocent. There was no DNA evidence from either of them found in the room of the murder, on the murder weapon or on the victim's body. Guede had every reason to lie if blaming them could exonerate him or spreading guilt could reduce his sentence. Innocent people don't tend to leave the country the next day.There is no way her or her boyfriend could have been involved with her rape and murder without leaving some DNA evidence. With no other suspects in sight the police pressed her and her boyfriend as much as they possibly could. Whenever there is a tragedy the longer it takes for the police to arrest someone, the worse it looks. Her and her boyfriend were easy targets. She was young, in a foreign country being screamed at by police for days at a time. If the police make it seem like your options are 5 years for a crime you know you didn't commit or 50 years for a crime you know you didn't commit, who wouldn't eventually crack and tell them what they wanted to hear? Even if you were to believe she was a psychopath, she clearly isn't stupid. I think she could come up with a better plan than 'lets taunt her, get some guy we barely know to rape and kill her in our own house, let him escape to Germany while we stay here and call the police without covering any of it up' Honestly, I think the Italian police got scared and didn't want to look stupid so they did everything they could to make it look like they were right all along. Instead of admit they made a mistake and had rushed to judgement. I think this girl was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and the Italian police and world media have ruined her life. The fact that she looks like a movie star could be the very reason this happened to her. A beautiful girl is a deadly murderer makes for a better story than, was accused of a murder she didn't commit because the Italian police are idiots.On the whole, this may be a bit insensitive to the victim (like all true crime), but, if you read up on the case she is clearly innocent."
" Interesting but biased in her favor
",0.4118,0.7404,2017-05-16 00:00:00,5,"People with only a casual interest in the case my find this documentary interesting. It's well-made and presents the basic facts well. The filmmakers made a number of pro-Knox tweets and comments prior to making the film, so it's not unbiased. I won't go over the evidence and its presentation in the film except to say that the case against Knox is very well presented on the website themurderofmeredithkercher.com. Also, the trial transcripts (highlights at least) and ""sentencing reports"" are online in English (in Italy the judge issues a kind of term paper explaining how the verdict was arrived at.) The final sentencing report is the Marasca Report. That report explains why Knox was found not guilty by insufficient proof, a weaker status than the alternative form of not-guilty. Reports are also online from earlier trials in which Knox was found guilty (Massei and Nencini) and not guilty (Hellmann.) I will make just two points: 1) Kercher's family, friends, and surviving roommates seem to think Amanda and Raffaele are guilty. They did not participate in the documentary except via old footage. 2. Prosecutor Mignini is portrayed as biased against Knox by his Roman Catholic religious views and Knox's alleged sexy, druggy lifestyle. That is unfair. No devout Catholic would think it right to judge unfairly an accusation of murder because the defendant had engaged in pre-marital sex. That would be a grave sin as any priest would tell you."
" Good, Doesn't Add Much
",0.4404,-0.9201,2017-04-14 00:00:00,6,"American exchange student Amanda Knox is convicted and eventually acquitted for the 2007 death of another student in Italy.Although I did not follow the story at the time, and have not really followed it since then, I still felt this documentary was a bit unnecessary. Despite not reading any books or watching any documentaries, I still knew the general case and the flaws in the evidence and that sort of thing. So this did not add much in that regard, and anyone who did follow the case will learn nothing.One thing I liked about this film, though, and why I still give it a positive rating, is its exploration of the media. One of the main interview subjects is a journalist who covered the story. He is an interesting character. While he is correct in saying this was not a ""trial by media"" (the case ultimately comes down to the prosecution defense and jury) he does seem to shrug off some of the more disturbing aspects of his role -- the diary leak, for example. And the inability of the media to just let Knox have a normal day once in a while.Generally speaking the film leans pro-Knox, but in fairness I think the evidence leans pro-Knox. Although again I did not follow the case that closely, if the DNA evidence was thrown out, there really is nothing connecting her to the murder. So if we believe in ""reasonable doubt"", she never should have been indicted and prosecuted in the first place."
" Guilty...both of a lack of objectivism and murder
",-0.7906,-0.995,2017-03-09 00:00:00,3,"I vaguely remember hearing about this case when I was in college. I remember her name, that she wasn't the only one involved, the murder was of her roommate, and it took place in Italy. I didn't even remember the verdict before watching this and I didn't look anything up before watching it.Going in with basically no information, I have made several observations.1. The way Knox talks about herself (either I'm the most dangerous...I am a wolf in sheep's clothing, or I am you). First off, Amanda, if you are guilty, you're not the most dangerous anything. There are hundreds of murder cases involving couples that otherwise would not have killed on their own. There's a whole phenomenon regarding this behavior studied in criminal justice classes at every university ever. It came across as very narcissistic. I was immediately suspicious.2. The evidence was pretty conclusive. The fact remains that, even if the men in this case weren't the perps, I didn't see how there was any evidence to suggest Amanda wasn't responsible. Perhaps she did it with them, or with two other guys (since they mentioned two other male samples from Meredith). Perhaps Meredith slept around like Amanda did. Perhaps Meredith slept with Rudy, left, and then Amanda, with two other guys (one of whom could have been Raffaele), and they escalated from there. Perhaps Amanda was jealous and killed Meredith after the guys were all gone. I don't know, but no matter how much you can make the case of which guys were or weren't involved, Amanda is still in the center of all of this.3. Her behavior. Who kisses their boyfriend in front of a crime scene? Who smiles at cameras and laughs and winks in court? Not innocent people on trial for murder in a foreign country. I'd be freaking out and not at all in the mood for any of that behavior. She only brought on the tears when she'd been in prison a while and probably hated prison life. Bring on the waterworks. She doesn't seem genuinely remorseful at any point during the trial or documentary.4. She offers no plausible alibi. Since it is likely Raffaele was at Amanda's apartment that night (and possible an accomplice), her alibi goes out the window. She NEVER offers an alternate explanation. Even when her lies are exposed, she clings to them.Overall, I didn't have an opinion one way or the other going into this and just based off of this documentary alone, I strongly believe she is GUILTY. If her goal was to look innocent in this, she failed. If her goal was to subtly suggest she is guilty and she's bragging about getting away with it and being a bada** (er, most dangerous person), she succeeded. You won't get that lucky again, Amanda. I suggest you stop killing people."
" Not quite enough of a look into the story.
",0.0,0.597,2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"This is a good documentary for a brief look into the infamous story of Amanda Knox, and I particularly like the way they have this led by interview pieces to camera with Amanda herself. However, I feel as though the documentary was almost slightly biased and didn't spend enough time looking into the other avenues of how the situation came about. It's worth a watch for sure, Amanda is an odd and interesting character to watch, but don't expect edge-of-seat gripping."
" A well made documentary on a fascinating case
",0.6808,0.9856,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"There's nothing I love more than learning about a new murder-mystery. There are certain cases that I have spent days reading about and trying to reach my own conclusion on. Some are undoubtedly more interesting than others. I knew very little about the 'Amanda Knox' story going into this documentary, so it was very interesting to learn all the facts and come to my own conclusion. It's a classic murder-mystery in the sense that there are things that don't make sense on both sides of the ledger. Both guilty and not guilty could easily be argued by anyone who knew enough about the case. If I had to lean in a direction by the end of the documentary I would have said not guilty, but I'm far from 100% certain on that. Anyone that lies in their statements to police is very hard to ever fully accept as innocent in my opinion.'Amanda Knox' does a good job of keeping things simple and easy to follow, but a flaw it has is occasionally leaving out information that would be great to know. There were times when things were brought up, like the detective saying the break-in was clearly staged, and then were never touched on again. No reason is given why it was clearly staged, just that it was. This is very annoying when you're trying to come to your own conclusion on things.There were some interesting, and at time deplorable, people featured in the interviews. Both the detective and the journalist said some bizarre and extremely arrogant things at times. This isn't a mark against the documentary in any way, they can't control how people come across, it's simply an interesting fact.I found this a fascinating documentary about an extremely interesting case. I'm glad I watched this and became familiar with it so I can now continue to look into the case and fine tune my opinion. There are far worse ways you could spend 90 minutes than watching 'Amanda Knox'."
" Corroborating Arrogance
",-0.5267,-0.9847,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"When I first heard that there was going to be a new movie called ""Amanda Knox"" I met it with a healthy dose of skepticism, I had become hardened to what mainstream and tabloid media had produced about this young lady and her Italian friend in the past decade; I had learned not trust the opinions of people who read only headlines.But I must say I was not only pleasantly surprised by the outcome, I welcomed it gladly like a breath of fresh air. You see, I am a researcher for the advocacy that helped Amanda and Raffaele correct misinformation in social media, I volunteered to read the ""mountain of evidence"" against them.I know the ""complex"" first hand, so McGinn and Blackhurst's use of ""simple"" is brilliant.The guiltless in context with the people guilty of robbing them of their freedom and rights. It evoked a visceral reaction in me that was a surprise, the usual eye-rolling annoyance gave way to white hot anger because the film was so intimate. It brought the antagonists right into my home and, yes, I did yell ""FU"" at the TV a few times.Amanda and Raffaele are those people you saw on film, no acting, the real thing. Just two ordinary people who met everyone's nightmare – duplicitous authorities. Those people you see against that stark backdrop are exactly who they say they are, McGinn and Blackhurst captured their personalities perfectly.They captured the essence of Giuliano Mignini, Valter Biscotti and Nick Pisa as well. It sickened me to watch them preen for the audience, but the very important point I want to make is that the public's dislike of Pisa, despite his drooling over headlines, is misplaced. Pisa is the tabloid jackal you see, but at least he is honest about it and that authenticity sets him aside from the other antagonists who have cloaked themselves in respectability; wolves in sheep's clothing.If my opinion matters to you, then kindly pay close attention to Prosecutor Mignini if you have not yet seen this film. To those who have, please watch it again and witness ""Amanda Knox"" parting the curtain to show you official confirmation bias at work in a justice system.The stunning arrogance of Guede's lawyer Biscotti, for example, about being the ""better attorney"" for the murderer while the uninformed public knows nothing about the Italian fast-track trial system vs. the regular trial system. Can you imagine being found guilty in a court of law without being represented by a lawyer or being able to cross-examine your accuser? Consider the legal plight of Raffaele and Amanda, outside looking in, during Guede's trials while Biscotti swept their Constitutional rights away.Giuliano Mignini's interview was the most telling, he is right that he knows Italian law. So well, in fact, that he used it to pull the wool over the eyes of Raffaele's well-connected family (including sister the cop) just long enough to force the young man to ""have his day in court"" as mandated by law. He also pulled the wool over the US Embassy in Italy by not declaring Amanda an official suspect until after her arrest, though she was under surveillance, wiretapped and Perugian authorities were preparing to interrogate her and Raffaele both. Mignini's signature on the detention forms was inked mere hours before help would arrive for both naive students, and those papers are the tip of the legal iceberg. Because of the wiretapping Mignini knew his unfettered access to the pair was coming to an end as soon as Amanda's mother arrived.I was most surprised to see Mignini's mantra from court transcripts for the world to see: ""Let's consider."" ""Let's imagine."" ""If only there was a video in the room."" Well, that last part is not in the film, only the case file along with many other examples of this so-called professional imagining ""what may have happened."" His penchant to ""make up dialogue"" for Meredith and Amanda was also present and this man has made up many disgusting things; that is without question.Then there is the prosecutor's denial of knowing how Lumumba's name was fed to Amanda during the interrogation in contrast to his confirmed presence just outside the room; while he was engaged in advising the police. Mignini is provably part of the more than a dozen Perugian law enforcement members present while she was abused, broken, and forced to sign away her life in a foreign language. It is heartbreaking to see the part of the film when Amanda finally realized that nothing she said mattered to him, all that mattered was his opinion.So Mignini knows intimately how Lumumba's name was introduced and his denial of that fact in this film is pure gold.You see the barest hint of his Madonna/Whore Complex in the film as well, osmotic evaluation of the legal dossier reveals a dirty old man entertaining the court with the latest script from his ""soap opera."" The scared foreign kid is ""crazy,"" the party-animal British Girls are ""proper,"" and the murder victim is ""virginal."" Satan, the Mason's, Reefer Madness, Catfights, Guede's Poop, it's all there. The man in the mirror is an arrogant official, a devil some would say, who lied to the victim's family and accused innocent people of a crime he concocted in his own head.McGinn and Blackhurst did a great job of taking a complex issue and simplifying it in ninety minutes. I invite you to take that time, kickback with a cocktail in the comfort of your own home and see how easy it is for an authority to scoop kids right off the street. Amanda believes the public thinks she is a monster, but the most frightening monsters are the powerful ones pulling strings behind our backs.Turn away from Amanda and Raffaele; and see the monster that stalked them. Giuliano Mignini."
