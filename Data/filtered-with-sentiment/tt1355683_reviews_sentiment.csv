" Johnny is ""Whitey""
",0.0,0.836,2021-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Excellent performance from J Depp.Very good casting, anyway.This is a totally underrated movie and I'm sure time will give ""justice"" to this work of ""reality""."
" Terrible Movie
",-0.4767,-0.34,2021-02-13 00:00:00,3,"I love crime shows and movies, and this was terrible. I tried three times to watch this three times and couldn't do it. There doesn't seem to be any real plot."
" Solid gangster biopic
",0.1531,0.964,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"In the mid-1970s FBI Agent John Connolly came up with a plan to target the Italian Mafia in the city of Boston. To do this he proposed an arrangement with childhood friend James 'Whitey' Bulger, an Irish mobster running the Winter Hill Gang in South Boston. In exchange for information the FBI would turn a blind eye to certain activities. It soon becomes clear that that Bulger is getting the better side of the deal; his operations expand and he quickly learns of anybody who informs on him. As the years go by it becomes obvious to others in law enforcement that he is being protected. As the list of crimes he is involved in, including murders, grows it is only a matter of time before his run of 'luck' ends.This is a solid gangster biopic; not in the league of 'Goodfellas' but still pretty good. Johnny Depp stands out as Bulger; he makes the character genuinely frightening as he won't tolerate any possibility of anybody talking to the authorities about him while he is considered a valued informant by the FBI. The story is interesting features several tense moments... often in scenes which end badly for somebody. The film nicely captures the feel of the '70s and '80s without trying to overstate it by referencing news not relevant to the plot. As well as Depp's fine performance the rest of the cast impresses too; most obviously Joel Edgerton as Connolly, a somewhat ambiguous character to say the least. Inevitably there is a fair about of violence but it isn't excessive, certainly less than many films in the genre... it is usually just shown in a matter of fact way. Overall this might not be a must see but it is worth watching if you are a fan of the genre."
" Solid watch

" Elegant crime drama with award worthy acting from Johnny Depp, Black Mass is a must watch
",0.7184,0.9986,2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"Black Mass is produced and directed by Scott Cooper, a well known and talented director. The film is based on a book and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, and the movie is about Whitey Bulger who is the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston and the man who plays him is Johnny Depp and he also played Donnie Brasco so the performance is incredible and the rest of the stellar cast did great. In the ensemble you'll probably recognize Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rory Cochrane, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemmons and Peter Sarsgaard. It's a great ensemble and the direction from Scott Cooper helped a lot. There's also some very fine cinematography, beautiful shots. Cooper's visual storytelling mixed with that cinematography was just perfect I'll tell you.The story is told in an interview format of the future informants and it then shifts to Whitey Bulger's point of view. It's based on true events and a lot is probably real, so I understand why they went with that approach but I think it would have worked better if the focus was on their perspective instead of Whitey as it isn't him that is telling the FBI the story. But the story shows the life of Whitey Bulger, many important parts. The other perspective we get to follow is John Connolly that is brilliantly played by Joel Edgerton, the two stories combines when John asks Whitey for help to take down the mafia and it's the perfect offer for him and his Winter Hill Gang. I'll say it again, Johnny Depp's performance is incredible, one of his best. The makeup and costume department was great, making things look authentic and realistic.There are so many good things about this movie, I love it. But I have to say it isn't perfect. It tries to be like Goodfellas but falls short in its pacing and editing, as the pacing in Goodfellas was perfect and the editing was superb, this film is the opposite as it doesn't have as good editing and also suffers for some weird pacing, the editing isn't bad it just isn't on the same level as that legendary picture. So what could they have done differently to fix the pacing? In my opinion, removed the subplot with Billy and Connolly in the second half of the movie but I understand why it was there. I like the movie though, it's amazing and the director have created a fine addition to the gangster genre. I liked Black Mass better this time around, on my second viewing."

" Good Enough
",0.4404,0.25,2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,A very decent crime drama that if given more depth could have been made into a fantastic mini series. There are so many good actors with decent parts but you are left hanging with most because the story is so vast.
" Good common mafia film
",0.4404,0.4482,2020-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Well done film on Irish-American mafia in Boston. It is good, and there is no flaw. However, it is not special either, and thus, forgettable. You certainly have watched other mafia films with the same level."
" Great acting by Depp but the plot doesnt do justice
",-0.2764,0.9824,2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the biopic crime drama Black Mass (2015) starring the ever versatile Johnny Depp portraying the Boston gangster Whitney Bulger who becomes a top-level informant for the FBI. and uses this advantage to clear out the competition and be the top honcho for a while. The FBI agent who handles the information is Bulger's childhood friend Connolly played by Joel Edgerton who slowly succumbs to the corruption. It's Connolly who persuades his fellow Boston Southie to turn FBI informant in return for help in crushing the Italian Mob. Soon Bulger tears up his town and becomes the most feared man in Boston. Funny thing is he is the brother of brother to State Senator Billy Bulger played by Benedict Cumberbatch who doesn't give in to the corruption.So many themes and subplots that could have gone in many different ways. But first lets discuss the acting...Depp was delivers as the plague destroying the people around him and the city he loves and lives in. Depp's rotting teeth, scaly skin, chalk-white hair and compelling sinister facial expressions including his demonic laughter makes his performance very intense. It would have been great if we knew his intentions like was it greed or pure insanity? This concept in the film would have made things way more intriguing. But rather focusing on the inner working of Bulger on how he came to power and specific to his rising power for example everyday gangster life - we see issues or problems he has which he fixes using violence.The rest of the cast including Edgerton and Cumberbatch are great. What lets down the great ensemble acting is the underdevelopment of the brother and the FBI agent. Yes we see the guy who is responsible for Bulger's reign of crime but didn't really understand the characters themselves. For example it would have been nice to look into the moral dilemma of both Connolly and the brother, one is tied to friendship however is on the other side of the law...the other is tied through blood who must use his political position to ensure he has no connections to the crimes committed by his brother. Was he disappointed of his brother or how did he respond during Bulger's reign?? To me these three characters were central and could have been utilised in such a way the movie itself would have been dynamic and compelling rather than centralising on one character and forgetting the rest in particular the transformation of Connolly in order to get ahead within the FBI. It would have been a thriller rather than a drama if the character was given an arc to hide from his FBI colleagues of the truth while on the job and also looking behind his back whether he may be a target for Bulger - similar to a cat and mouse film.The plot itself is too generic and rushes the end which lacked the intensity it deserved for the actors which is a shame. It feels too recycled and not original and the subplots are not intriguing enough to make this film a classic. The filmmakers should have focused on the story more rather than focusing on specific scenes - overall underwhelming 6.9/10"
" Great crime drama
",0.1531,0.9738,2020-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Despite it's generic approach to it's story, Black Mass is still a great crime drama that's tense, thrilling and chilling. Johnny Depp gives an incredible lead performance and one of the best performances of his career. Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and Corey Stoll all give great supporting performances. Scott Cooper's direction is also great, it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The music by Tom Holkenborg and the soundtrack are both good."
" MK Ultra Victim ?
",-0.2732,-0.8815,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Great Movie, Depp deserves an Oscar for his transformation, his eyes are pure evil in this movie !
I missed the MK Ultra connection when I first watched this, which makes it even more interesting. But just do a google search and a lot comes up. Along with the revelations that Charles Manson was also a MK Ultra victim, it appears the CIA have been spreading Chaos in America since their inception. Along with the drug running etc (watch American made) I do not know how they continue to get away with what they do... including maybe murdering and or destroying Presidents.
Anyways back to the Movie, a great watch for any who enjoy the Gangster genre !!"
" mostly boring

that awful makeup of the main gangster is so annoying, he looked like a zombie when he was young and by the end he got better :)

" Interesting and well acted...
",0.5859,-0.265,2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,Interesting and well acted gangster movie based on true events. Unfortunately the character development is really bad. Witch is really hard to do with so many characters in limited screen-time. Would have worked better as a Netflix series in my opinion.
" Hard Hitting Stuff
",-0.1027,0.89,2019-11-13 00:00:00,7,"First off, I am a huge fan of movies set in the Boston area, especially crime movies like The Town and Mystic River. Here is another cool one to add to the list, though it does fall short.Black Mass is the story of a mafia leader who slowly takes over the game. He is well tied into law enforcement too, through his brother and best friend growing up. Therefore, his tracks are covered. This movie showcases his rise to fame.It's not too violent of a film surprisingly. And Johnny Depp does a horrible performance, and his makeup is terrible. But the movie depicts a ruthless mafia guy taking over the business, and it does it well. It goes into random situations and occurrences, and most just seem to drag the story along. In the end, it's a good watch.Recommended7 stars"
" Nice to kill time on an airplane...
",-0.4404,0.8453,2019-10-28 00:00:00,3,"If you need that much of make up, fake no-hairdo's etc... why not just go for a different actor? There are many talented actors who could have played the part. Depp is doing Depp, but he does not radiate any danger. Only Holywood danger. After Pirates Depp will always be Jack Sparrow. A cartoonesque figure."
" Creepy cross of Goodfellas with The Departed
",0.0,0.2425,2019-10-14 00:00:00,5,"I know Boston only from what I saw in the movies and for sure it does not look like an attractive city.In this take - from a real story - corrupted FBI agent Connelly helps gang leader and childhood friend ""Whitey"" to become the boss of all dirty business in Boston.At first reluctant to become a ""rat"" - because being a drug-dealing murdered is much more honorable - Whitey decides to use the protection given by the FBI to eliminate all his rivals.Johnny Depp morphed into the glacial Whitey, a balding, blue-eyed psycho. The transformation is so complete that I could hardly believe it was Depp. It is also very distracting, even if Depp is amazingly good.This movie lacks the thrilling suspense of The Departed and the deranged ""cheerfulness"" of Goodfellas and it certainly is not a heartwarming tale, but a well executed, realistic story of a despicable characters.PS as a ""happy ending"", the corrupted Connelly got a heavy sentence and he's still in prison. Whitey ended up even worse, despite all his years on the run."
" Better Than Average Hood Flick - Black Mass
",0.4404,-0.7566,2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Johnny Depp gives the best performance of his life in this South Boston tale of crime and punishment. The life of Jimmy Bulger is a cautionary story, as is the demise of Connelly, the hood in South Boston politics who protects Bulger. Crime does not pay. There is nothing glorious being killed in prison. The acting, direction and cinematography are all first-rate"
" Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau. We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all.
",0.4574,0.9572,2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Black Mass is the story of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), who was the brother of a state senator and the infamous violent leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang. It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.Directed by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.Although compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and certainly not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.There's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it. There's some truly electric scenes, but they are few and far between, which gives us ultimately just a compact and safe piece of gangster film making. 5/10"
" A lot better than the ratings given here
",0.4404,0.9672,2019-08-10 00:00:00,6,"As a voracious reader of true crime this story naturally gravitated into my hands.
The book is brilliant so I was looking forward to this movie. Johnny Depp is always good but his make up makes him look unnaturally out of place with the other actors, even on the fourth viewing as I genuinely like this movie.
The best actor in this is Joel Edgerton, he gives an absolutely brilliant performance as an over confidant, professional idiot which Connolly was.
It's loyal to the book, it's paced well and all the actors are fantastic.
The bad reviews, I don't know what these people were expecting."

Honestly, I could not get past his blue contact lenses, which was more distracting than realistic. This was only second to Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent, which was also quite distracting. While it's based on true events, it seemed like a lot of repeated events until people finally started getting caught."
" Depp's Depth
",0.0,-0.8684,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Cooper helms a substantial crime drama based on real events. This film's narrative mirrors the real life documentary based on Bulger's trials in the outstanding documentary, ""Whitey: United States of America V. James J Bulger"" by Academy Award- nominated director Joe Berlinger which adds to the realism and accuracy of this film. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. All artists involved deliver superlative performances. Depp, Edgerton and Cumberbach in particular stand out. However it is Depp that truly commands the screen. The plot revolves around real life infamous gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger who terrorized South Boston as the leader of the 'Winter Hill Gang' and his brother Bill who is a powerful leader in the Massachusetts Senate. Set in Boston during the 1970's, the Irish hoodlum Whitey pursues a life of crime using ruthless and brutal tactics. Eventually he is approached by FBI Agent John Connolly and is convinced to help the agency fight the Italian mob and take out his competition. Soon enough their unholy alliance ends but Whitey continues to increase in power and evade capture becoming one of the most dangerous and deceiptful gangsters in U.S. history. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. This viewer's favorite is when we see how brash, feared and vicious Whitey was when he guns down a victim in broad daylight surrounded by witnesses. He then strolls away without a care in the world as if nothing happened and it's just part of his normal day. The film is duplicitous, gritty, violent, intense, realistic, formidable and has a cathartic ending. The film is mesmerizing, captivating and is one of the better films in it's genre."

Besides the physical aspect, we are so used to seeing him as Pirate Sparrow, here we get the change to see another Johnny, the great actor Johnny. Critics say that is the best work of his career, and it might be true. How he plays Whitey, really convincing and really catchy.Besides him, there is a bunch of good secondary characters like the always amazing Benedict Cumberbatch, who only has to breath to have all of us waiting for him, or like Joel Edgerton, who is really great actor and this role is like a ring for his finger.The movie is a gangster movie, don't expect it to be a kind of ""The Godfather"", which is almost impossible to make, but nonetheless it's a well made movie with a real story behind it and worth watching to learn a bit more about it and enjoy good actors on the screen.Review written: 23/10/2015"
" Black Mass has its own moments, but will test your patience for sure.
",0.4497,0.9955,2018-09-27 00:00:00,4,"First of all, I had NEVER heard of this movie. It's just by chance that I got to know about it when I had ordered a DVD of the crime-action flick THE DEPARTED and instead got a box set containing both the movies. I had really enjoyed THE DEPARTED and thus I had no choice but to watch BLACK MASS since I had got it along with it. I had spent my money, I had to deal with it.Now comes another curious case. I took me three attempts to finish this movie. At first, I watched the first 27 minutes and turned it off. Weeks later, which was yesterday, I decided to give it a watch. I watched till the 43rd minute and then again turned it off. After a few hours, I became determined to finish this movie at once. It turned out to be fine since the second half did improve a bit. BLACK MASS didn't really get me involved until an hour was already gone. There were good moments in the first half as well, but they were just very, very few. Thankfully, Johnny Depp's performance is great as James 'Whitey' Bulger. He has sunken his teeth into the character and has come up with a strong performance. The film had got my attention right when I found out it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it. He has done a great job, but unfortunately, his character doesn't get much scope and that's true. Joel Edgerton is decent.What works in favor of BLACK MASS is Depp's fine performance, some brief yet decent action bits, a few dramatic moments and the ending score. What doesn't work in its favor is the unfocused screenplay, poor editing, underdeveloped characters (which is a surprise since this is a crime drama which devotes almost every bit of it to nothing but its characters) and a patience-testing first half.BLACK MASS isn't in totality a bad movie, but it's just not the kind I'll prefer watching anymore. Except for a few moments, there are no thrills or exciting moments which made THE DEPARTED engaging. BLACK MASS is everything but not engaging. The film's only high moment is only during the climax even though the things feel wrapped up a bit shoddily but still nicely. It did make me keep checking how much time had elapsed, whenever I found the scenes longer or boring.Perhaps it's due to my seeing the film in parts that I'm not completely exhausted. BLACK MASS is a very standard gangster film meant strictly for the fans of crime dramas as well as Johnny Depp. Rest others, see for yourself. As for me... the DVD is just going to be... there in the collection, although I doubt I'd ever want to see it again."

For someone who knows a good portion of what happened during that period it offered some interesting backstory and just told what happened. If they tried to go off from what really happened and use some creative license I think it would appease a lot of the neh sayers. But I for one enjoyed the movie."

",-0.4585,0.5504,2018-05-24 00:00:00,7,"The film tells the true story of Whitey Bulger, and there are various strands of it which could have been the focus of that story (his links to his Senator Brother, links to the IRA, etc) , but the one chosen is his partnership with the FBI. This reveals the murky nature of the FBI at that time in which his agent handler is more concerned with using Whitey to further his own career, protecting him as a source, rather than using Whitey as an informant to bring down the Italian Mafia. This is because they grew up togethor. The inter-relationships are sketched out more as politics, and business, rather than personal, and whilst engaging, the lack of that personal element is what keeps this film as a steady film, rather than an outstanding one, despite some excellent acting, and period style."
" Too derivative to be a great film
",0.6249,-0.836,2018-05-06 00:00:00,6,"BLACK MASS is a crime thriller that strives to hark back to the 1990s era of similar filmmaking, with movies like DONNIE BRASCO and GOODFELLAS ruling the day. This one stars Johnny Depp as a feared and infamous assassin who worked alongside corrupt cops while taking down a string of victims during his violent career. He managed to evade the authorities for many years, no mean feat in itself. The film's plot is packed with murder and violent incident, but it feels like an attempt to return to glory days rather than being anything new or fresh. The profanity irritated me a bit and the endless parade of familiar faces have little to work with. There's no sense of era, really, just more and more time spent in the company of hateful or corrupted characters. I enjoyed it to a degree, but is it one I'd keep coming back to? Not particularly. In addition, Depp's prosthetics - and in particular contact lenses - are too distracting."

",-0.6597,-0.34,2018-05-02 00:00:00,8,"The film leaves a lot of blank spaces and concentrates only on the most memorable moments of the crime life of Bulger. It think it is mostly due to length. The film has a limited time. A whole miniserie could be dedicated to the more complete story of Bulger and the mafia take of Boston with more details. It will likely be done because there are lots of lessons in it. For what it is, this film gives plenty."

Whitey became an informer for FBI agent Connolly in exchange for protection, an alliance which he exploited. Based on a true story, the film's action and drama was a cut below its fictional counterparts. While Depp gives us a great performance, the film moved in a slow gear. We learned that jai alai is crooked, which is common knowledge to just about everyone.The characters in the film were very stiff for South Boston.

Johnny Depp completely carries this film, elevating what is some very average material and a generic script to something that is at least engaging and occasionally entertaining. His portrayal of notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger is brilliant, and is the sole reason that 'Black Mass' is worth watching.Depp aside, this film doesn't have much going for it. As someone who watches a lot of crime/dramas, there's nothing about the storyline or script of 'Black Mass' that makes it stand out. It's dominated by scenes of blood and violence and often gets carried away with itself, but beyond the high level production and Depp's excellent acting, 'Black Mess' is just a standard gangster film."

He shows us different sides of Bulger. We see the tender father, the loving son, the loyal friend and brother. But of course we see the cold, violent, psychopathic gangster. Depp's portrayal is by far the best thing he has done for years. Truthfully I expected an Oscar nomination, but it never came. All the support cast is excellent; especially Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch. Also look out for Juno Temple in a scene stealing sequence that begins outside a police station and ends in a deserted house. That's stayed with me, long after the movie ended. Peter Sarsgaardalso has some memorable scenes and I always like to see Kevin Bacon in a movie. As good as the performances are, I don't love the movie. It's good to watch, but its not got much rewatchability. I don't like gangster/mobster movies in general anyway!! But I can still enjoy a great one. There are no heroes in this one, certainly no-one to root for (No Elliot Ness in Untouchables) except maybe incoming prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who begins the clean up at the FBI. The story is fascinating, although I wish it were done better. Black Mass grossed $62 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 49th highest grossing movie of 2015. Which is pretty much on par with a movie starring Depp in his pre Captain Jack Sparrow days."

It sounded pretty good - a true life tale of how a gangster turned Government informer, plus it had a stellar cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and that creepy guy out of 'Breaking Bad' who looks a bit like Matt Damon. However, when I started watching it, I soon realised why it never really set the Box Office alight.It's dull. That's it. This is going to be a pretty short review. There's really not that much I can say about it. It's just boring. I suppose I've watched a lot of these gritty true-life gangster/snitch films in my time, therefore I couldn't see anything new here. However, I really do think that anyone fresh to the genre would find this a little slow and hard going. It may have a decent cast, but that almost becomes a problem. The film bounces around from actor to actor and from present to past and feels completely disjointed, like each scene doesn't really relate to the one that's gone before. Then, because every scene doesn't feel like it should follow the one before, the whole film comes across like one big series of mini stories where the actors are never allowed to show their considerable talents because none of them are ever allowed the time to do so.Whatever the public mood is towards Johnny Depp right now, he's always been one of my favourite actors and I'm certain he has plenty of good roles ahead of him. Just like I know he loves to immerse himself into whatever part he's playing and is more than happy to do whatever it takes to 'look the part.' As with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' he's almost unrecognisable as the main character, sporting a balding hair piece and more than a few added wrinkles. However, it takes more than a good set of prosthetics to make a movie and, unfortunately, his passion for his craft doesn't save the film.It's not terrible, but for the cast that's been assembled for this production you'd be expecting something along the lines of 'Goodfellas.' Sadly, the only two words that come to mind here are 'boring' and 'forgettable' (sorry, Johnny)."

Movie has terrible reviews but because of my experience with Depp's movies I refused to believe. Anyway, I most often love movies that are widely bashed on internet. This time, unfortunately, that was not a case. The film is based on the true story of the famous Boston mobster who spent decades at the FBI's Most Wanted List. Classic cliche crime drama about the mafia the likes of which we've seen many times in the past, and which does not bring anything new to this outworn genre. Not a trace of originality. Observed individually, this movie is pretty much nicely done, but in the context of the genre it is shallow and dull.

" A Bland Look at the Underground Boston Mob Scene, Black Mass Fails to Make Use of a Powerhouse Performance from Johnny Depp.
",-0.4215,0.9951,2017-11-05 00:00:00,4,"I had gotten my hopes up for Black Mass, perhaps too high, when I heard Johnny Depp would be playing the lead role as infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. Combined with director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) it was reasonable to think that Black Mass could be a triumphant return to Donnie Brasco form for Johnny Depp, and a strong gangster picture in its own right. Upon seeing the film, I was disappointed. Depp's Whitey Bulger lives up to the hype, but the movie around his performance never got me hooked.Black Mass recalls a period of time in the mid 1970s when Irish Mob Boss Whitey Bulger began working with his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and FBI informant John Connely (Joel Edgerton), to take down the rival Mob families of Boston. Sure, it is an interesting true story, and Whitey Bulger is an interesting real life character, but the film struggles mightily to build a dramatic structure. This should be a movie about personalities, about betrayals and backstabbing. But Black Mass plays more like a documentary. It follows certain characters, but not intimately. Its players serve as parts used to explain the inner workings of the Irish Mob and the FBI. Not as individuals with their own feelings. In a documentary, there is an interest that comes from seeing the actual historical evidence of the story. In a crime drama, you have to do more. I never felt that Black Mass had anything of its own to say about Whitey Bulger, the Mob, or the FBI. The drama in Black Mass is incidental. All I saw was a film that tells me what happened, but not what it meant for anyone involved.The reason Black Mass doesn't work is not because of the performances. Individually, there is some great acting on display. Edgerton and Cumberbatch are convincing as hard boiled Bostonians, and Kevin Bacon gives a performance reminiscent of his work in Mystic River. Depp, however, is the main attraction, and his Whitey Bulger is the first truly Oscar-worthy performance from him in years. Working with cold, blue eyes, he creates a ghostly, menacing figure that can stare at the screen and tell you more about his character than any amount of writing can. And that's a good thing, because Bulger is not much of a character on the page. According to the script, he's a bad-tempered wise guy, a la Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas. But that's it. Depp does all the heavy lifting. He fleshes out Bulger as much as possible, illustrating his fierce connection to his son as well as his hair trigger temper, but it's still not enough to save the film.Black Mass is not a bad film, but it is a misguided one. There are good performances all around, and hints of strong filmmaking, but the movie never managed to grab me. Simply telling Whitey Bulger's story is not enough. With only an admirable Johnny Depp performance to differentiate it from the countless crime dramas that have come and gone in Hollywood, Black Mass is unfortunately forgettable.43/100"
" Perhaps Johnny Depp's strongest performance
",0.4404,-0.949,2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"James ""Whitey"" Bulger ran South Boston's crime scene with an iron fist in the 1970s and 1980s, but for a good part of his reign of terror he harbored quite a secret – he was actually an informant for the FBI. In particular, he was an informant for Agent John Connolly – although the usefulness of Bulger's intel was often in dispute – all the while continuing his violent rampage over the city against anyone who would stand in his way.The ruthless Bulger is played in Black Mass by Johnny Depp, an actor not really among the first who come to mind when the character of a crime lord is brought up. Depp has long been known for looking the part in each of his disparate roles and avoiding typecasting. But in Black Mass, even though he doesn't look like an Irish mobster – he completely embodies one. It's really his finest work, and that's saying something.The movie is told in flashback, as a member of Bulger's inner circle recounts the whole sordid deal to another FBI agent, including the involvement of Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as well as Bulger's brother, state senator Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). The brutality of Bulger's day-to-day existence isn't tempered; men and women are killed or maimed or harassed for seemingly benign reasons. There seemed to be no middle ground for Bulger. He liked you, you lived. He didn't, you didn't. The movie covers his feud against his Italian rivals in Boston, the Angiulo family, as well as his foray into the high-stakes world of betting on jai-alai in Miami. And how did Bulger get away with so much? Mostly through the protection of Connolly, who used Bulger's (scant) information to further his own career. Crooks protecting crooks. The rabbit hole is deep indeed.But man, is Depp ever great. I stopped thinking of him as Johnny Depp soon after the movie began. It's funny – to look at Bulger in this movie, you probably wouldn't take him for a mob guy. He's wiry, he's balding, he wears glasses. Nothing tough leaps out at you. But the ferocity of Depp's exceptional performance puts that notion to rest. Cumberbatch, as his brother and fellow Boston native, is also very good and with a surprisingly believable accent. Kevin Bacon shows up as an FBI guy; I think this was his third go-around as a Boston-based law-enforcement officer."

He imbues a reality and depth of character which is faultless and reminds the viewer that he is more than a foppish pirate or a Tim Burton stooge but an actor of great range.The actual historicity is no doubt very much in question but this is still a good, entertaining movie.I agree with some other reviewers that this could easily have become a masterpiece with just a little bit of tweaking. Scorsese instantly springs to mind although I doubt that he would have cast Depp.Overall a very good movie with well fleshed out characters, well acted by a quality cast.Give it a view."
" ""Black Mass""- A fascinating true story of crime and corruption turned into a drab, mediocre gangster-flick...
",0.4215,0.9983,2017-10-08 00:00:00,5,"To be honest... I've actually never been a particularly big fan of crime and mafia-related film and media. I can see their value. And I can understand their appeal. It's fun to sort-of put yourself in the shoes of men and women who do terrible things and sort-of vicariously live through stories depicting the criminal underbelly of major cities. And it's fascinating to see how these stories can play out and how these people either thrive or ultimately fall. But I find myself quite picky when it comes to these sorts of films and typically only enjoying the better entries. Because frankly, for every ""Godfather""... for every ""Casino""... there's about a million and a half lesser or even overtly bad films or shows or stories dealing with this subject matter. So I try to look for the best of the genre on the odd day I find myself interested in watching one of these sorts of films.""Black Mass"" is a strange and fascinating beast. Based on the enthralling and troubling real-life story of Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, and sporting a top-notch cast of wildly talented performers, this should have been an easy and surefire hit. And yet, director Scott Cooper and the screen writing duo of Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth deliver a film that never quite comes together. Only mildly entertaining and informing the audience with some shallow surface level thrills and admittedly fantastic performances... while ultimately feeling far too dry and clinical to really leave a mark. The ingredients are there, but the final product feels hollow and without any real substance. Watching this film is like trying to chew on air- there's just nothing there.Johnny Depp leads a star-studded cast, as the story follows Bulger's rise and fall in the Boston underworld over the course of a number of years, covering some of the major events of his life- from the tragic death of his son, through his troubling connections with the FBI as an exploitative informant, to several of the murders he was tied in connection to. And to give credit where it is due, Depp is a phenomena in his portrayal of Bulger, and the cast at large is quite good. Depp has always been an incredible persona in the world of entertainment, but as of late his performances have lacked variety and mainly fallen into the realm of ""quirky goofballs."" Here, we see his sheer talent at work, as he lets the role take him over completely. Supporting performances by the likes of Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cumberbatch similarly light up the screen (though Cumberbatch hasn't quite nailed his American accent yet here), and it's just a joy to behold everyone on screen. This most certainly is an actor's film.And in terms of simple aesthetics, director Cooper does do a pretty stellar job in terms of his visual storytelling. The film is slick, gritty and definitely feels very true to life in terms of direction and flow, and Cooper's keen eye for composition and detail lends a lot to the proceedings. And this is wonderfully accented by cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's superbly grounded lighting and some good, moody score by composer Tom Holkenborg. It's a well- crafted movie at very least in terms of production. But the issue here is the story and the portrayal of characters. And that's where it starts to fall apart and lose faith and interest from the viewer.While my knowledge of Bulger's life and dealings isn't quite vast, I do know a bit about him, and I know that his story could make for one hell of a film. But ""Black Mass"" doesn't really give us much outside of sheer, blatant details and facts. It's a very calculated film that doesn't really even attempt to delve in the heads of Bulger or his associates much at all, save for a few key scenes early on. It just presents facts over and over. Cold, hard facts. This happened. Then this happened. Then this happened. And it's monotonous for much of its screen time as a result. This could have been a very dark and provocative character study into the mind of a career criminal... instead, it feels like the writers are going down a studio mandated check-list of things they had to include. It takes the soulful performances of Depp and the others and strips away the humanity by not allowing us to care about them or at very least get invested in what's happening. Even with people like Bulger, there needs to be some degree of humanity or reason or exploration to the film for us to care. This is just a roughly-arranged timeline of ""stuff happening."" Hackneyed and trite in terms of structure and delivery. And it robs the film of virtually all potential... coming across more as a drab, dry and dreary presentation on Bulger than a compelling film about him.And that's why I just can't forgive the film, despite its remarkable performances and some admittedly solid direction. It's just such a chore of a film, lacking any entertainment or interest. And that's a shame. Depp deserves better. Heck, even Bulger deserves better in a way. And ""Black Mass"" just fails to meet its sky-high potential. I'm giving it a very mediocre 5 out of 10, and would only recommend it to the biggest of crime-story junkies and fans. All else really need not apply."

Those accents made it almost impossible for me to pay attention to just about anyone else in this movie.

The book upon which this film is based includes many details that are absent from the movie, as is typical of adaptations; yet here, it's a detriment. Consider for one Whitey Bulger grabbing a prepubescent boy from the neck and forcing him to give the reigning mob boss a blowjob... Is Johnny Depp with the cloud-steel blue contacts ""dancing"" without knowing the whole story? I'd guess not. In fact, i think that the boy- sex-scene wound up on the cutting room floor. In fact, I thonk that many vital scenes were cut to make the film of- appropriate-length and also legallly-acceptabe in terms of violence and sex that's acceptable by the ratings association. In the vein of films like ""Goodfellas,"" this mob movie is subpar and solid.

" Decent Gangster Flick
",0.0,0.9803,2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I personally am not aware that much of the real life Whitey Bugler, so can't really vouch for the authenticity or how true it is to the actual story.As a movie buff, I liked the movie, though it had a strong hangover of Goodfellas, Departed and Donnie Brasco. The movie though not in the league of these gangster classics, is still pretty much a good effort. One of the prime reasons is Johnny Depp, in the main role. Personally, am a big fan of Depp, but of late most of his performances have not really required him to do much, except to wear masks, or wigs and act funny. After quite some time, good to see him in a role that does not require him to clown around( notwithstanding the fake looking prosthetics). As a vicious, pyscopathic gangster he is brilliant, radiating menace, with his presence, a flick of the eye, or his measured way of speaking. Apart from the fact that Bulger seems to care for his son, there is not much that is redeeming about him. He is selfish and opportunistic, he plays along with his friend John Conolly( Joel Edgerton) a Fed agent, promising to help him out, but in reality uses him for his own selfish ends. He is ruthless, and pyscopathic to a level, where he gets rid of people, at the slighest suspicion. Matter of fact, he is the guy who does not even trust his own shadow.The movie at one level runs as a morality play too, on the dangers of setting a thief to catch a thief. Conolly tries to use Whitey to get to the Mafia, by using him as an informant. However Whitey turns the tables on him, by providing him basically with junk information, and uses it as a cover to get his own with the rival Anguilo gang. In a sense, Conolly causes his own downfall, by getting too cozy with Bugler, maybe it could have been due to his childhood friendship with him. At one level, it could also have been a traditional Irish-Italian rivalry in 70's Boston. Was Conolly soft on Bugler, due to the Irish factor, as well as the community feeling? And what exactly was the relationship between the Irish mob and the IRA? This is where I feel, Black Mass falters somewhat, the performances are good, the scenes are well written, but director Scott Cooper, just tries to pack in everything, without really delving deep. The movie looks more like a montage of elements from earlier gangster movies, dinner table talks where hints are dropped, the brutal in your face violence, the liberal usage of the F-word, the protagonist going into a downward spiral and pulling others along. And the scenes are pretty good too, one particularly good one, where Bugler has a dinner talk with Conolly and his associate Morris, where he almost threatens Morris into fear and then does not. Or the scenes between Whitey and his brother Billy( Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator.But the rivalry between Bugler and the Anguilo brothers is treated in a pretty sketchy manner. This is an area where so much could have been explored, especially the Irish vs Italian angle, but director Cooper just gives it a very cursory glance. Again the link between Bugler and the IRA is not explored in depth, we really do not know what motivates him to help them out. And due to this, it just remains a middlingly good movie, instead of a classic.The performances are pretty good, apart from Depp, one more great turn is by Joel Edgerton, as the FBI agent who makes a pact with the Devil himself. Benedict Cumberbatch is however wasted in a role that really does not do much justice to his talent."
" Boss Cast, By the Ton.
",0.0,0.9735,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"Joel Edgerton as usual stepped in front of the camera, and did damage. He is an impressive actor, and is always wonderful to watch. Cumberbatch is always looking to stretch himself somehow, challenge himself as a true artist, and again, thumbs up. An Englishman who pulled off an Irish American accent pretty well, from what I could hear.Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing to watch. I'm not really drawn to any of his movies, or the type of roles he plays, so seeing him in something this different, and executing it so well, was a joy to witness.The rest of the cast, especially Jesse Plemons, were also pretty good. However, as good of a performances as every one of the actors achieved, Black Mass feels like a squandered classic. It lacked a certain extra, or necessary thrill, and much of the movie feels a bit too, forgettable.Black Mass is by no means a bad movie at all, it just, wasn't as good as it was perhaps meant to be. What carried it however, is something that should be a major contributor in any film, and that is the cast. The cast was just, noteworthy.I would seriously love to give Black Mass a 7/10, but, honestly, it falls a little short because, things are missing in it, and ultimately the film feels like something we've really seen many times before. So, 6.7/10, that I'll reluctantly round up to 7/10."
" A ""Must-See"" For All Gangster Movie Fans
",0.0,0.9974,2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"In this movie, a series of testimonies by a group of criminals tells the story of how the FBI and a mobster in 1970s' Boston entered into an extraordinary alliance to bring down the city's Italian mafia. Both sides co-operated with the aim of eliminating their common enemy but their collusion also resulted in the small-time mobster being given all the latitude he needed to develop into a criminal kingpin.Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), the leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang, was involved in racketeering, extortion, controlling vending machines etc. but was also increasingly troubled by the Italian mafia who were steadily muscling in on his territory. When his childhood friend and FBI agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) was assigned to clean up the city's North End, he immediately targeted the Italian mafia and persuaded his boss, Special Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), to let him exploit his friendship with Bulger to gather the intelligence they needed to bring an end to the mafia's operations. McGuire reluctantly agreed and a deal was subsequently struck between Connolly and Bulger. As a reward for his co-operation, the deal gave the gangster an assurance that he wouldn't be arrested.Bulger made good use of the protection he was given to carry on his criminal activities uninterrupted and after supplying Connolly with some useful information about the Italians, the FBI agent was able to bring them to justice. This enhanced Connolly's status within the FBI and removed Bulger's only criminal rivals. Connolly's loyalty to his old friend who, as a child, had protected him from bullies, then led to them socialising together and Connolly becoming ever more corrupt as he ignored or discredited any evidence that he was given against Bulger. Things then changed for the FBI man when a new ""by-the-book"" prosecutor was appointed and Connolly suddenly found that, from that time on, he would have to play strictly by the rules.Director Scott Cooper does a great job of condensing all the important elements of this true story into a hard-hitting end-product that convincingly recreates the era in which it's set. The dialogue is also economical and sounds very authentic, especially in the FBI interviews with Bulger's closest associates. The action features a great deal of brutality, profanity and corruption and a tremendous number of executions, with many carried out by Bulger himself. He's a terrifying psychopath whose volatility and paranoia provoke him into killing even when his victims don't necessarily present any great danger to him and so it's interesting to see the various passages of the film in which his more human side is depicted. In these scenes, he's shown as a kind father and a loving son who's helpful to old ladies.It's striking just how strong Connolly's bonds are with the characters that he grew up in the same neighbourhood as him and it's this loyalty that paved the way for an arrangement which gave Bulger's gang the freedom to carry out their criminal activities for so long without any adverse consequences. It's also interesting that Bulger's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a state senator during the period when the gangster's arrangement with Connolly was in force.The quality of the cast in this movie is exceptional with everyone providing superb performances and the unrecognisable Johnny Depp absolutely immense in his role as Bulger. ""Black Mass"" did well commercially and is definitely a ""must-see"" for all gangster movie fans."

Nothing was really spectacular about the movie, but then again, there wasn't much that hurt the movie too much either. Stick around and see what I really thing.Synopsis: Based on a true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a ""secret trading"" deal with his brother, William ""Billy"" Bulger, a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly, an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals. Starring: Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Director: Scott CooperFirst off, let's get the one thing out of the way that hurt the movie the most. Yes, this is a movie about the entirety of Whitey ""working"" with the FBI. Yes, everyone knows everything that Whitey said was completely false or was fabricated from older reports that lasted from the seventies into the nineties. At least let us know when you change time eras though. They did a couple of times, but for the most part they didn't let us know. I had to look at the clothing, cars, and various other objects to try to figure out when in time the movie was happening. Don't make people guess as to what is going on unless it is a strong mystery. If it is a true story, let people know when things are happening.The good things of the movie, other than the story which I won't go into, are the actors. Every single person was the right person for the job. The only thing I didn't like was that the age difference between Johnny playing Whitey and Dakota Johnson playing his was completely wrong. I know he used to be married to a woman that is the same age as Dakota, but still. There are better actresses for that type of thing. And I know it's nitpicking, but so what. It's how I feel.Keeping with the actors, Joel Edgerton is a chameleon when it comes to acting. He can do it all it seems. Has this guy ever made a bad movie? I don't think so. He is just that amazing.I never heard of Scott Cooper before I saw this movie. When I looked him up, it seemed I have seen a few movies of his, but nothing that stood out. Same goes for this movie. It is just there.Final Thoughts: If you have seen other crime movies that take place in Boston you have them all. Even though this is a true story, it seems that all the crime movies based in Boston take from the Whitey Bulger story. I'm thinking that is why I was not impressed with this movie. Still watchable though.Rating: 7 out of 10"

This movie captures the grittiness of many Boston neighborhoods in much the same way ""Mystic River"" did. The story is a cautionary tale about power, in this case as wielded by the FBI, and counts as one of many black marks against an agency that rewards ambition more than integrity. The treatment of Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother, who rose to become President of the Massachusetts Senate and President of the University of Massachusetts, is nuanced but perhaps overly kind. I lived in Boston during much of this time, and in Southern California when Whitey was apprehended, so I was aware of much of this story. What I really didn't know was the high proportion of his associates who ultimately turned state's evidence against him."
