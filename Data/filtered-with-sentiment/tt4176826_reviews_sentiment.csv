" This movie made me so uncomfortable
",-0.5214,-0.1213,2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"All the scenes with real people embracing ""hitler"", taking photos with him and saying literal nazi rhetoric were so uncomfortable to watch. It was still a really good movie with a serious message that we should think about."
" If Hitler came back?
",0.0,0.85,2021-04-03 00:00:00,6,"No-one would think a man like Adolf Hitler would be popular in Germany today right? Think again - a movie that does a good criticism on our world and the dangers that history can at all times repeat itself. A slightly amateur movie but a good, creative idea."
" Excellent thought provoking film
",0.4404,0.9103,2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,Expected some sort of Borat-esque cringe comedy but got so much more. Pretty hard hitting ending that definitely gives you lots to think about over how easily influenced we all are.
" This is not satire.
",0.0,0.8519,2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Look Who's Back is a German adaptation of a book with the same name. This movie might be looking like a foolish, pointless comedy. Let me just tell you. This masterpiece brings truth about modern society and us, humans. It's one of these movies that actually makes you think. The acting is also incredible. An underrated movie. Watch it."
" A complete failure
",-0.5106,-0.6292,2020-12-31 00:00:00,1,This movie fails on all levels! It's neither an entertaining comedy nor an intellectually deep movie and even less a warning sign where it wd be appropriate! To me it felt like a fast cooked set of superficial plotting deemed to be instrumentalised for political reasons without any justification for that!
" ""The book was better""
",0.4404,0.9964,2020-12-14 00:00:00,2,"...and even the book was not that good, in my opinion. The issue for me is this: the summary is more interesting than the material itself. There is the premise, ""Hitler wakes up in modern day Germany"", and I'm like: well, that sounds interesting, you have my attention, what's next? The problem is that the answer in either case is not very satisfactory. However, at least in the book, Hitler delivers a social commentary by interpreting the current day world from his point of view, which is somewhat interesting, although it does get stale after a while.
The movie, however, at least the first half that I watched, foregoes this in lieu of presenting us with Borat like scenario's, as mentioned in other reviews. And (given the success of Borat itself, I guess the problem is with me), I just do not find this funny. And here's why: for example, let's look at the scene at the dry cleaner's. Hitler wants his uniform cleaned, and starts stripping in the store, down to taking off his underpants. Cut to close ups of the other people present (employees, customers) showing awkward or shocked reactions. Well, no really, what would you expect? But it has not much to do with Hitler. If I would walk in there with normal clothing and started stripping that way, do you think they'd be like: yeah, that's perfectly normal, we get that all the time here. In Dutch we have an accurate word for this: ""onderbroekenlol"" which translates as ""under pants humor"", but it basically means ""low brow comedy, often focused on nudity, breaking wind, etc."". And that is the level of humor in this movie, where, given the premise, it could be so much smarter. Like the scene with the dag (#Snatch): oh look, Hitler is attacked by a small dog in the background of someone talking about how he likes dogs, and ends up shooting the dog. First of all this is not the sort of comedy I find funny, but more important: again, like with the dry cleaner's, in a scene like this, how is it different that it's Hitler that this is happening to, compared to just an average person? It isn't really. Oh look, Hitler draws a generic looking caricature of someone, do you get it... well, he wanted to be a painter back in the beginning of the 20th century, funny right? And on and on this goes. And in scenes which are more connected with the fact that it is Hitler, it's still very surface level and predictable. Again: you confront a random afternoon shopper with suddenly pushing (someone looking like) Hitler in his or her face, of course you get awkward reactions, but try to imagine yourself in that situation. Would you have the quickness of mind to have a totally politically correct, well argumented rebuke in that situation, or could you be lured into saying something that can be used by the filmmakers in the context they want to present? If it's the former for you, don't worry, they will cut that out anyway.For me it is the missed potential than I find the most frustrating: you have a great premise, and you could do so many interesting things with it, and you end up doing the most predictable and boring slapstick like comedy. What a shame..."
" He is here again
",0.0,0.9177,2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Has anyone ever wondered what the world would be like if Adolf Hitler returned this very day? Well, this semi-documentary has got some pretty damn good ideas about that. As his character himself put it ""I live in each and every one of you"" so basically his ideas will never fully have died within the minds and souls of everyone because people like to hate other people; they thrive on their hatred and that's why such people are so easy to manipulate. It's easy to say that you can get rid of the problem by eliminating it but does that solve the problem itself? It's easy to say that you can make the people equal in their rights but will it suffice to all of them? Most of today's people with their heads full of TV-ad-propaganda are easily manipulated as well, sadly, and that is why, I think, it wouldn't make much of a difference if someone like Hitler had come to the stage to ""save the world"" again. The movie bares no cinematic impact upon the industry or the viewer himself but provides only the food for thoughts, a great deal of them actually. Hatred and intolerance make people see the world one-way-not-another when in fact there are so many different angles and perspectives to living and letting live and if it takes another Hitler to have this finally banged into our heads then shall it be done."
" Beautiful Movie
",0.5994,0.631,2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant film, inspired by a book that starts from an original idea and never seen before, manages to always be comical but also manages to give its message despite being a comic film."
" Brutal, Dark and Brilliant!!
",-0.2225,0.6369,2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Hitler waking up in 2014 and still being Hitler is what drives the scare in the movie. A brilliant performance by Oliver Masucci portrayting Adolf. This movie will make you laugh, wonder and above all make you think."
" Shocking and exposing
",-0.5859,0.9927,2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,"""Er ist wieder da (Look who's back)"" is a 2015 German satirical comedy directed by David Wnendt starring Oliver Masucci and Fabian Busch. I'm wrapping up the month with one of the most popular and critically acclaimed feature films of the recent years from my own home country of Germany. Based upon his own novel of the same name writer-director Wnendt created a film that asks an absurd but not less curiosity provoking question: What if Adolf Hitler lived in the twenty-first century? There have been several parodies and adaptions that depicted the life and death of the infamous dictator, but no film has ever dealt with that question of what would happen if he was still alive. The results of this feature film are simply astonishing. First of all, the actor who plays Hitler, Oliver Masucci, does an incredible job as the tyrant and even if he isn't as accurate as Bruno Ganz in ""Downfall"" (mainly because he is too tall), it is sufficient in this context, as he is still able to portray the most important characteristics of him. While the performances of most actors are basically wooden and bland and more cringe worthy than acceptable, he is tolerable and fortunately carries the film with his sheer presence. But what is it that makes this film so utterly interesting? Well, the simple fact that most scenes were improvised in a ""Borat"" kind of way and captured the genuine reaction of the people. For instance, in one sequence in the very beginning they went to the Brandenburg Gate and just pointed the camera at Masucci who, obviously dressed up as the dictator, walked around and entered the crowds. It is his gift for improvisation that makes it so shocking and absurd at the same time, as he reacted to whatever the unaware people gave him. And what most people did was nothing short of shocking. While most people stood there and stared at him in total disbelief, it was unsettling to see that the majority approached him and took selfies with him while doing the Hitler salute and exclaiming fascist paroles. For our modern society that allegedly knows better than their ancestors back in the day, this is a pathetic display. As if that wasn't already enough, it goes even further and tackles enough other topics. I mean, you have got a man who claims to be the man responsible for millions of deaths and instead of calling the police or initiating his arrestment, nobody does anything about it. Instead, supporting character Sawatzki makes it possible for him to appear on television and share his world view over again. Before he gets there, though, he embarks on a road trip with him and is letting him interview a diversity of people who let the former head of state know about their biggest worries. Again, all those reactions are unscripted and mirror the opinions of the individuals asked. From baiting towards refugees, over people who give full scope about their fascist world view to people who still believe that the Third Reich was the best thing that has ever happened to Germany, you get all of it. And that is shocking and sad. Most people casually say that some situations like in the thirties could never happen again, since the people of today were more enlightened nowadays. While this is luckily the case with most citizens, there are still too many people who have such a human right violating opinion about so many things. As you can see in the case of this film, it only takes one guy dressed up as Hitler and they tell you everything. But it is not only what a few people think. As Hitler gets to appear on live television, he manages to share his ideas all over again, and surprisingly, intended by the writers of the film, this fictional version of him tells a lot of ""relatable stuff"". While it is obvious that the real Hitler never would have shared the exact same mindset as his fictional counterpart, the version in this film has a few ""plausible thoughts"" (I am putting this in quotation marks, as it is not my own political opinion!). Beforehand, the writers did it deliberately to give him views that criticise the current social injustice, so that the viewer could relate to what he has said. Another thing that contributes to the effect that this alleged Hitler imitator gains more and more popularity is that not a single soul takes him seriously and that he is introduced as a comedy act. Under the veil of humour, he gets a platform to reach and teach the nation about his world view once again. What lead to him becoming popular once again, though? Well, as already mentioned, nobody takes him seriously and the media, in this case fictional network ""MyTV"", prize profit over moral and use this sensation, the spectacular return of the mass murderer for their own success. Of course, it is almost impossible that the real Hitler was still alive in the 21st century, but isn't it strange enough that nobody takes legal actions against someone who doesn't only dress up as him but also shares the same fascist mindset? Like, it is legally prohibited in Germany to dress up as him. Well, in the end he manages to regain his old popularity and is once again a celebrity. As he says himself, back in the day the people elected him legitimately and wanted him to be their chief of state. Nobody forced them to vote for him, nobody considered him to be the evil man, he then continues. And this statement is shocking because it is sadly true. That is why the film ends with him as a man with celebrity status, and thus the film states that it would indeed be possible for someone like him to regain power, as enough German people still have a racist world view. That the film ends with a montage of bystanders doing the Hitler salute is the final proof that many people have a lot to catch up on. All in all, this satirical comedy gives an alarming insight into the political views of too many Germans and mirrors what the saddening reality in this modern country is. While it could have been even more snappy, it is enough to point out the worrying truth and teach the viewer to be more tolerant. It is marginal, provocative but hits the bullseye. A great satirical comedy that shows us that we Germans of today may not be to blame for what our ancestors have done, but that we are responsible for something like that to never happen again. And that is something that sadly many people still must learn."
" Questionable as its fun enough to shape new perspective
",0.2732,0.4914,2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"I simply loved the scene of Hitler at modern live TV show. It was magic, giving me goose bumps. We surely feel the power of silence and his talent, great humanity which makes him so attractive&different from all others.The ""what if"" interestingly filmed but scenes of Hitler being criticised by locals / confused crowds / selfie jams in modern days make you think.
The content of movie is fiction and it can stay in our head, able to change&shape new perspectives. The real Hitler was certainly not ""funny"" like how he's described.We see the intention of author and director positining politicaly right and ethnic nationalisms criticisirg on current issues. The film is intellegently expressing some ideas using mouth of Hitler, trying to eliminate immigrants."
" Scarry to see that this is possible in the streets of Berlin.
",0.0,0.9914,2020-05-21 00:00:00,5,"Understanding that this is a book adaptation, it was a really good choice to use some kind of hidden camera element like we see in the films with actor Sacha Baron Cohen, to accentuate the theme of this satire film. That said, the film will take more liberties and differ from the book, resulting in a less superior story.The reaction of the the public was the most interesting part of the movie. I was honestly quite shocked to find out how easy-going people were after seeing something that, for what I understood, holds a great stigma in Germany. It was scary to see people level with Adolf as they talked about the status quo and started agreeing on very strong and often very right statements. The kind of statements that are shortsighted and have no complex context, but sound empowering by promising prosperity. It's clear that this can mirror how the real Hitler, or other politicians, use these signs of discontent from the people in order to push their own agenda.Another topic that I find, and this may me more subjective, is the debate on weather or not we should keep certain things a taboo. A lot of people threw a quirky smile, or rose their hand as got a picture with this ""comedian"". Most of these people may not identify with the ideologies that Hitler represents but merely act along with the joke. Still I think it's fair to say that this behavior is what develops the story. By doing so they gradually lift the veil of this stigma and give it a platform. Kind of like the book and movie ""The Welle"". A story about a similar social experiment where the kids are just joking around, but eventually get caught up in it all.Sadly, though there is a lot to think about, I do not feel as though most of that is credited to the movie itself, it lacks clever writing or strongly researched philosophies. instead it is rather on the nose and weaves a silly story through it all that I just couldn't get into. Everything felt a bit childish. Even Hitler himself was not really that spot on (unlike the claim of most other reviewers). I thought be was kind of immature, shortsighted and often straight up dumb. Like when he broke the car lamp and tried to put the broken glass back into the lamp.Wile writing this review I was reminded of one of the characters in the media team, who said something about reviewers that will often rate satire higher in order to not look stupid. So do with that what you will. I get the picture, I just feel as though the movie itself wasn't as strong.(+) Social experiments and ideas that are thought provoking.
(-) Lacking dept in the topic at hand
(-) Boring characters and silly story."
" Intriguing idea is handled inconsistently
",0.0,0.9636,2020-04-11 00:00:00,5,"The idea behind this movie - Hitler finding himself in the 21st century and reacting to (and using) modern day Germans and new technology - is one that's both very intriguing and full of potential satire and humor. However, the end results are kind of a mess. On the positive side, the movie's dark attitude to the drama sometimes really hits the target, revealing that some evil opinions are still in a lot of German citizens and could be reactivated easily, as well as giving a plausible look as to what Hitler would use in this day and age (such as the Internet) to get what he wanted. At the same time there is plenty of absurdity that prevent things from being so black that all the entertainment is sucked out.But the movie has just as many flaws as it does virtues. One flaw for some viewers who are not German is that the movie seems squarely aimed at a German audience who will understand all the references to present (and past) German society. I admit that some references left me scratching my head. Another problem is that the story really jumps all over the place. Plot threads are dropped for a long time before resuming, the improvised bits don't really fit with the scripted material, and there are also a lot of unanswered questions here and there. A third problem is that the production values are quite often pretty tacky and cheap, which makes this world have less of a believability than what was intended.So as you can see, the movie has its ups and downs. Is it worth watching? Maybe. I would recommend you start by watching the first thirty minutes. If you find enough interest (and also are able to look past the flaws), you might get enough out of the entire movie, especially if you can watch it for free. Though it may be best to watch the movie in thirty minute chunks so that the flaws don't get too overwhelming at any sitting."
" A fascinating premise.
",0.5423,0.9477,2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Look Who's Back is engaging, funny, clever and original. Oliver Masucci terrific as Hitler.Almost brilliant, however the drama elements aren't up to par, nor does it finish memorably, given the level attained and avenues available."
" Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 9:
",-0.4019,-0.836,2020-04-01 00:00:00,6,This satire is certainly going to rub some people the wrong way. The core concept of Adolf Hitler reappearing in modern day Germany is handled in a number of way throughout the film making this an incredibly unique if a little uneven experience.Occasionally this film strikes a series tone and tackles issues of the media's role in spreading hateful messages and the underlying prejudice that can often go unchecked in everyday life. Other times the film features Sacha Baron Cohen style man on the street segments relying on cringe humour. Neither of these elements are done badly but the film often fails to link the two ideas and when it introduces a meta element (one very reminiscent of the third act of Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation) the whole thing begins to feel like a tonal mess.
" Black humorous film
",0.3818,0.1032,2020-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely a great work that shows the front and the back. On the surface, it is just a series of events that happened to Hitler's resurrection. But in fact, it uses the seemingly absurd plot to seriously talk about national politics and nationalism. The film is full of nationalist discrimination and prejudice. It is ruthlessly exposed and licked the scars of history, mocking this bad history, but the purpose is to express the concerns and concerns about the current situation of the people in the country. The whole film says that Hitler needs the people. And the ending point is exactly what the people need Hitler. He is just a genius born from the needs of the people. He is full of vision and highly provocative. Regardless of ancient and modern times, he is just a miniature of the hearts of millions of people. The history is right and wrong, but it is always a fault Do contemporary people need to be vigilant? In general, the irony of the perfect score is perfect. If Hitler's first half of the plot can clearly express Hitler's personal characteristics, it is even better. The segment that imitates the destruction of the empire is definitely the most important point of the film."
" confusing movie..
",-0.2263,0.802,2020-02-11 00:00:00,2,"The movie is definitely different.. Starts as document-like alternative reality, tries to behave as if real public interviews were done and movie shot by amateurs, sometimes attempts to philosophize another time it's an absurd borat-like comedy.. The motive could have been written up in many various ways.. Nevertheless, I did not get the message of the movie.. if it even had one... After all, it was not that funny actually.. Maybe you one can try finding some hidden ""value"" that is not there.. but still it is nothing for me.. A stupid commedy would be much more acceptable to me..."

" Hitler came back, but his ideals have always been here!
",0.3595,0.544,2020-01-18 00:00:00,9,"In this work based on a book of the same name, the satire, very well orchestrated, is about Hitler in person - if we can call him that - going back to the present times in the exact place where the bunker where he was said to be dead. Inserting a short man with a short mustache, hair licked from the side and military uniform from Germany in the 1940s playing Führer himself in offices and on YouTube channels in the modern world, the comicisms for the time deviation just couldn't be greater than the criticisms that the unusual figure would attract and realize, being filmed in a mixture of scenarios set up for the script and a commentary tone with interviews on the streets today.Without being disrespectful to those persecuted by the dictator and his nation of lunatic supporters, ""He is back"" presents a narrative ranging from a growing and comical black humor caused by the insults to Hitler to the reflections on what the insults and antics have done by themselves they were, and still are, capable of doing.Not only impressed by the similar characterization and the great performance in the role of the German dictator by the actor Oliver Masucci, the film is able to surprise you with a progress that has been hinted at since the beginning of the story, taking the dictator to the same point that he would one day it arrived provoking and taking advantage of indoctrinated revolts and intolerance - exhibiting exactly the obvious that would happen if Hitler really came back to life.""You talk like him"". In parallel with what happened to Hitler in history, with the presentation of his appearance, his fame, his exile and his unfortunate triumphant return, the satirical work proves, unfortunately, that all the blind ideals that caused the darkest period in history modernism remain present and sympathizers hidden in the real world, just waiting for the speeches, stimuli and leadership that will lead them on the path of ignorance and indifference that soon turns into protests, uniformed marches, fanatical greetings and violence against other human beings who they are then lowered from that level, repeating history that should never have been repeated and never even happened.It's scary how reality looks like a work of fiction."
" If it walks, talks and acts like a duck...
",0.3612,-0.1809,2020-01-17 00:00:00,6,"'Look Who's Back (2015)' walks on very thin ice for its entire duration. In fact, you're not even sure it isn't going to fall in until its final few moments. It's a dark satire that ponders over what might happen if Hitler somehow arrived in the 21st century, using a mix of real-life and staged footage. Basically, it posits that the same attitudes that led to Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s are still prevalent today. It tackles a plethora of themes and is only subtly opposed to them, trusting its audience to understand what it's trying to say. However, you'll only get out of it what you put into it; if you think Hitler was a diabolical person with diabolical beliefs then the flick will reaffirm that, if not... well, you're no friend of mine. The thing finds its success in its brazen ability to cut to the candid heart of the issues it tackles, working much more as a fairly disturbing drama than as an 'edgy' comedy. It isn't all that well-made and it isn't hugely entertaining. It's strangely engaging, though, which is partially because you're constantly trying to figure out where it stands. It also bends its documentary, mockumentary and traditional sequences rather well, helped by an all-in lead performance and the actor's uncanny ability to improvise in character. The affair is slightly hypocritical in that it says you shouldn't give a platform to the sort of hate Hitler spews (even if it's masquerading as satire), yet does exactly that simply by featuring it (even though, ultimately, it decries it). It's an interesting and often uncomfortable watch that's difficult to put your finger on. In the end, I think it's decent. 6/10"
" A good premise that ends up being boring.
",0.1531,-0.1304,2019-12-14 00:00:00,5,"This had so much promise. Going in to it I was expecting a comedy, some satire, maybe a political message. it ends up being boring. There are so many times in this movie that I just thought, why has nobody investigated this guy. The plausibility of a person impersonating Hitler being able to get so many people behind his message is just ridiculous. People are radical yes, but eventually someone would run his fingerprints or things like that and realize he is the real one and he would be locked up or executed. It's a cool concept but it's handled poorly which makes me really sad that this movie isn't entertaining."

I wasn't a big fan of the planned stuff, but the film is almost worth watching just for the random interactions with the public, kind of like a German Sacha Baron Cohen. There is some great and chilling material there. Also good to see the odd objector in modern-day Germany, like people asking him to leave because no one should be impersonating Hitler in public."
" Painfully bad novel adaptation
",-0.6808,0.9546,2019-08-04 00:00:00,2,"""Look who's back"" turned out to be a fine novel maybe lacking some in-depth knowledge about Hitler, yet a very interesting idea to portray current Germany through Hitler's eyes in this satire.The movie, however, fails in adapting the novel adequately. In addition to that, literally every change is bad. One of the emberassing highlights is a scene that parodies (or so?) a famous scene from ""Downfall"". Its humor fails completely to be funny, and unwillingly funny are the ""dramatic"" scenes.
An interesting part is there, however, when we get to see documented scenes of Hitler meeting with people from all over the country.In conclusion, if you're interesting in this topic, I recommend rather reading the novel. It's worth its time more than the 2 hours it would cost you to watch the film adaptation."
" Could be a masterpiece!!
",0.6892,0.9236,2019-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Only two problems make this movie fail to be a masterpiece; scenario and presentation of the movie as a comedy film.Scenario critics; Returning of Hitler should have caused much more reaction in Germany and the world. The movie has a fault to prefer minimal consequences. On the other hand, new Hitler easily adapts himself to new world; this is far from convincing.Presentation critics; the movie can't achieve to be a proper comedy or dark comedy. Two preference could be better by this context; eighter the movie could be designed as a satirical drama, not comedy, or if it will be a comedy, comic elements should have raised courageously.Within a general view; the movie strikingly tells that the world can easily be convinced to fascist ideas, still years after Hitler. Only cursing Hitler means nothing alone. The movie makes us witness to potential Hitlers inside our brains!Shoul be seen."

" Er ist wieder da: Walks a fine line between offensive and genius
",-0.296,0.7523,2019-05-14 00:00:00,6,"This German made movie is a lot of things, but forgettable certainly isn't one of them.It tells the story of Adolf Hitler as he wakes up in 2014 dazed and confused. He sets about finding his place in this new world and is quickly picked up by the media as an entertainment sensation.It's a hard movie to pigeon hole, it's genre would be very difficult to clarify. One thing is for certain it's justifiably controversial but things aren't as simple as they first appear.This movie isn't propaganda, it has no agenda, I can see people on the left calling this a right wing movie, I can see people on the right calling this a left wing movie. Truth be told it's about as centrist as it could possibly be and is a powerful piece of social commentary.With strong performances especially by leading man Oliver Masucci (Hitler) it's a remarkable piece that walks a fine line between offensive and genius.It's not funny, it's not exactly dramatic but it is fairly clever and certainly memorable.I can understand why a lot of people would be disgusted by the film. It's comparable to if they made a movie about Jimmy Saville returning from the grave and opening a daycare center. It's eyebrow raising, it's questionable, but if you watch it with an open mind and really pay attention to what you're watching you'll see it's remarkably deep.Not for everyone, but is a fascinating watch no matter your social or political leanings.The Good:Oliver MasucciVery cleverMemorableThe Bad:Causes the skin to crawl in placesHighly questionable"
" fun and intelligent
",0.743,-0.2023,2019-04-26 00:00:00,7,This is a fun film and it made me smile a couple of times. I also think it makes a valid point about the danger of being seduced by populist and of not taking the far right seriously. The fact that it as the tone of a comedy strenghten this argument. It is obviously not an elaborate political commentary... so dont expect one.

" A comedy with a message
",0.3612,0.8012,2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is a film that really makes you think.It starts off as a comedy, an out of place Hitler tries to adjust to modern society. In this regard it is absolutely hilarious, and incorporates random, unscripted segments of Hitler talking to actual German citizens about the problems that they see in their day to day lives.It moves slowly at first, and eventually moves beyond a comedy to a dark story about Hitler rising once again to power, largely in part to how perverted and profit-driven the media company that he becomes associated with works. He makes money, and people like hearing what he has to say, because they believe he is a comedian poking fun at Nazi Germany. As it progresses, we see his true colors, but he has too powerful of a following, similar to how he rose to power back in the 30s. The people who realize what is happening are powerless to stop him, and are removed from the picture. It stops being a comedy, and we, just like those in the film, realize too late what is happening.It draws eerie parallels to our modern world, and provides a stark warning and comparison to the current nationalism that we have been seeing in modern days. I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that it communicates its message extremely well."
" Brilliant Satire

Perhaps the most unsettling element of the movie is the ""likeability"" of one of history's great monsters-- he is funny, insulting, and supremely confident while at the same time humble in his new surroundings.
The remaining characters are mere filler. An awkward romance between Hitler's ""bestie"" (free-lance journalist Zawatsk) and a Goth television secretary doesn't work.
But the character of Hitler is scary good.
You can understand the charisma that swept him into total control of Germany, and nearly the world.
Hillarious, thought provoking, uneasy."

However even with a Lefty mindset framing the intended plot/message of this film I still found it to be superb for a couple reasons:1) The film production, story, writing, direction, acting, casting, wardrobe and music... all were fantastic and truly shows modern film what real movies as works of art/entertainment could/SHOULD be. Whatever political mindsets the creators of this film have personally you can tell they all were dedicated to making a quality movie here. 2) This was one of if not THE mos honest portrayals of Adoft Hilter I've ever seen in a mainstream film (even if they were making fun of him a lot of the time). The writers did of course add some of the cliche exagerations and myths about him to make sure we never forgot he was 100% evil and had zero valid points or perspectives and no one should ever for a split second question what they told us in the history books ... but even with those in there it was refreshing (and mesmerizing) to see the man portrayed with the least amount of historical bias (lies) as most all stories of him are normally surrounded with (bad grammar there but you get my gist).One other thing I enjoyed was that this was a German language movie. I speak English but I really enjoyed the German actors and their language in general. Bottom line - this film was entertaining by itself but as a WWII/History buff I found it doubly rewarding and will no doubt watch again soon."
" Incredibly funny, just a pity about the uneven dramatic element
",0.1851,0.9949,2018-10-06 00:00:00,7,"Adolf Hitler wakes up in Berlin...in 2015. After getting his bearings he is discovered by an unemployed TV producer, Fabian Sawatzki. Sawatzki thinks Hitler is some sort of performance artist and takes him around the country, talking to the general population, for a TV piece he has envisaged. Hitler, however, sees this as a chance to regain his popularity and power.From the synopsis you know already this is hardly your average movie. The central plot is quite preposterous but works. Hitler coming to terms with 2015 has a Borat-like feel to it (which is a very good thing) and, like Borat, leads to some really funny moments. It also provides an opportunity to critique our modern lifestyle - the whole ""you have this wonderful medium called television and yet you fill it with banal, unintelligent crap like cooking shows"" observation was absolute gold.However, while it works very well as a comedy, this is undermined by writer-director David Wnendt trying to turn it into a drama with a political and social message. Nothing wrong with that, generally, but it is quite badly done here. The plot and message are incredibly muddled, and mostly seem to consist of having a go at the right-wing of German politics, without proposing any alternatives or solutions. At one stage there is even the implication that democracy is bad because it allows the Hitlers of this world to be elected. Ok, but what's your alternative?It also doesn't help that you need to know a fair bit about current German politics and societal problems to understand the issues and get some of the jabs, and I don't.The dramatic part of the movie spills over into the comedic part, in that it ruins the flow of the comedy. Furthermore, it is difficult to take the dramatic parts seriously, after the comedic element. This said, it is never dull and when it's good, it's great. The scene that parodies the famous war-room scene from Downfall is brilliant - very clever.All this is enhanced significantly by a superb performance by Oliver Masucci as Hitler. He looks like Hitler and has the mannerisms now pat - incredibly convincing."

So many scenes serve as mirrors and reflect on our mindsets as a society.It's better than Downfall and is probably the best movie-documentary I've ever watched.Totally recommending this movie to anyone knowledgeable of history, cultural references and socio-politics matters who wants to have a laugh, yet a very serious and surreal experience."
" A Borat-style farce with a threadbare plot
",-0.4019,0.9886,2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"This movie provides pretty much what it advertises: ""Borat""-like scenes of actor Oliver Masucci, in full Adolf Hitler getup, hilariously and sometimes terrifyingly interacting with real-life German citizens. Some are happy to see Hitler; some are angry. It's all undeniably entertaining, and perhaps there's some social value to these proceedings as well.Outside of that, there's a thin plot about a cowardly filmmaker, played by Fabian Busch, whose career prospects aren't looking too good... until he finds a very committed Hitler method actor who seems to have materialized out of thin air in a local park. Busch's associates at a failing German TV network (Christoph Maria Herbst and Katja Riemann) soon realize this Hitler lookalike is a boon for their ratings... until it becomes apparent that he may not be an actor after all.It's predictable for the first two thirds, but the final third gets a bit trippy and surreal, which I very much appreciated. And the film has some surprisingly touching and dramatic scenes sprinkled in amid all the goofy comedy - this is Hitler, after all, and the crimes he committed are directly addressed in a serious way.While those serious and dramatic bits sometimes clash with the comedic ones, overall this is a fun, unique German satire that should keep you entertained and may even make you think (plus it'll scratch a particular itch for those who love Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat""). I'm looking forward to watching it again."

I think if Hitler were to return in this form (mistaken for an actor) he probably would be able to change the thinking of the German people. Fortunately it appears that time travel is well nigh impossible, so we can enjoy the film for the fantasy it is.10 out of 10 for the acting, cinematography, dialogue, and storyline.

" A Daring and Dark Comedy that makes Light of History's Worst Man
",-0.0258,-0.3661,2017-10-07 00:00:00,7,"Look who's back is an entertaining dark Comedy that plays out the scenario of what if Hitler just came back in 2015? The answer that the film comes to is that he would simply be regarded as a comedian that is simply going for a shock value in his work, and the public just eats it up. This is where the social commentary of the modern day comes into effect and, with the hindsight of the last couple years comfortably behind us, turned out to be pretty much dead on with its assumptions of 21st century society as a whole. The idea that a person like Hitler would not only be considered popular and funny enough for people to go along with the gag until it is too late and they realize that the monster that they have fed and helped grow is now too big to kill is really almost prophetic now looking back on it in a post-nationalist movement USA and Europe. As a whole though, if you ignore the feeling like the point of the movie may have been rendered mute by society just 2 years after its release, you will have watched a very entertaining comedy about the worst human to ever be born. I really have to hand it Oliver Masucci for really taking a very difficult role in the role of Hitler himself, and making him simultaneously hilarious and terrifying as well as nearly making the monster that is Hitler likable. I wouldn't have believed that sentence unless I'd seen the movie but Masucci really does that good of a job in the movie. It's just a shame that the direction and pacing of this movie aren't worth Masucci's talent. The direction of this movie is all over the place and it can hit a lot of really funny, saddening, and scary moments but it fails to find a solid path to lead us from one scene to the other. instead of making a road that leads from scene to scene in a way that feels natural the pacing of this film feels more like each scene is a stepping stone in the middle of a stream and the audience is forced to awkwardly hop from one scene to the next with no set goal in its delivery other than to go from start to end. Overall the movie is worth your time, it makes a really solid point about how modern society seems more willing to accept people saying really horrible things so long as we assume them to be comical and like I said before Oliver Masucci really does some amazing stuff with his role in the movie."

I believe that it would be a good idea to examine the movie in two main parts which are comedy and political: Comedy: Even though it is not a full-time laughter fest it indeed is funny and makes the movie viable for any one looking for a relaxed watch.Political: On the other side, the movie has many political/sociological messages in it which are not just from one perspective. It does not try to impose one idea to the viewer instead it embraces them to think which definitely is a great value for any movie. I will not detail the ideas as it is for you to find and evaluate, even though, the final of the movie gives a clear message.P.S. How they ended the movie is especially beautiful(NO spoiler). It does not have strict edges and but also does not leave the viewer totally blank.An amazing experience is waiting for anyone who is going to watch that beautifully made movie."
" A must watch!
",0.0,0.9957,2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I kept this movie in my backlog for too long. At first I thought it's going to be another silly comedy with a character from the past waking up in modern days and gasps in wonder how this 'magical' technology works. It wasn't the main reason I put it aside though. I thought it's going to be full of exaggerated moral lessons and whatnot. Oh boy I was wrong. It's true that the main character IE Adolf Hitler discovers wonders of the modern world, but the movie doesn't make a big deal of out it. It plays it out to Hitler character. He is amazed and excited how can he use modern technology to further his goals. Hitler makes a lot of commentary about modern state of media which is pretty universal and not exclusive to German media. I think everyone can take few interesting lessons here. The most funny part of the movie in my opinion is how he reacts to the modern politics. I don't want to spoil it, but I was really amused with what party he identified the most(at least at first). It made sense actually. I really liked and laughed out loud when Adolf took jabs at his political ""successors"". His commentary about how pathetic they are were spot on and faces these people made were priceless. In my opinion it was the best scene in the movie after his first TV speech. It's worth mentioning that acting(and writing of course) is really superb. A+ for actor playing Adolf Hitler. Oliver Masucci was born to play this role! Charismatic, smooth talker and really believable. His screen presence was absolutely overwhelming. Without him it wouldn't be the same movie.The much feared by me moral lessons are of course there, but it's not hamfisted to the point you want to just puke. They are actually smart social commentary even if I don't fully agree with them. Movie actually made me question what the real message is and I like this in movies. It makes them less a masturbatory propaganda material to remind you what moral stance you should have and more a movie that makes you seek answers on your own.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone interested at least a bit in politics and history. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much and at the same time was enough interested in the movie to be sad it ended. To everyone else I can give a solid recommendation."
" Good performances, could have been better
",0.7003,0.9673,2017-07-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie touches an interesting topic, based on the book 'Er ist wieder da', where Hitler awakes 70 years after his death in Berlin, alive and kicking. Although this is marked a comedy, and has some funny moments, it is not really a comedy. And that also means it lacks goal; the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Comedy? Thriller? Documentary? Propaganda? The movie is carried by the good performance of the lead actor playing Hitler. As the movie progresses, it's becoming more and more a political commentary, but unfortunately of the cheap kind. One could say that as political commentary it slides into the same manipulative propaganda it condemns in Hitler ('I play people like the piano'). This movie could have been better if it had chosen for a clear direction (e.g. political commentary, or philosophical challenge to the value of democracy). Although OK, it struggles to rise above B-film status."
" Elvis Lives; No Wait, Hitler Lives!
",-0.3595,0.8348,2017-06-23 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)Imagine Hitler's attitude to creating a username for an email and ""Adolf_Hitler@.x.com"" has been taken. He would not be happy. That is a real scene in the film! He also fervently refused ""Adolf_Hitler_8@.x.com"". I've never seen a film like this. It brilliantly mixed irreverent comedy with seriousness in a very clever story that only the German's, maybe, would have the right to do. The story opens with Hitler, the Hitler from 1930's, awakening in a garden in the city, confused and interacting with everyday Germans. People's reactions range from expected anger at the image of Hitler to laughing, pointing and waving at what weirdo impersonates Hitler in full military dress. A local news channel discovers him and gives him airtime as an amusing Hitler impersonator who never breaks character. He gets lots of media coverage and begins to do what he did so effectively in the 1930's; where the story turns serious. I've never seen such a movie like this. It was totally captivating, funny and eerie. I highly recommend this!"
" An interesting message in a movie with a creative idea
",0.6808,0.9982,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"A movie with a great idea of Hitler waking up in our time based on the book with the same title.I liked it for the most part. I liked the idea and how it was written. Bringing the humor and at the same time sending a message with it. It is especially well done how the movie flows. At first it is more of a lighthearted comedy which gets more serious with the time and the last scenes of it are not about humor anymore but summarizing the idea of how Hitler would have a chance in our time to repeat the history. |We get the mockumentary moments where Hitler talks to people and they give him their views on current politics and what bothers them. I have looked into it and seems that they were all staged and just presented as real interviews. It is pretty well done though how most look at Hitler not as a history monster but entertainment and are exited to take selfies with him.The portrayal of Hitler by Oliver Masucci is great. He presents the Hitler energy and charismatic speaking very well. He makes us kind of like Hitler. He is that interesting outspoken guy even though in the back of our mind his crimes against humans in the past remind us of who he really is. And from time to time his actions, like killing the dog, bring us back to reality that he is not a nice human being. Yet this portrayal of Hitler as a man we are drawn to and enjoy listening what he says about wanting to improve his country instead of showing him as a caricature monster shows how we can still be influenced and manipulated these days even by somebody with the views that we are so sure we will not repeat by having learned from the past.The scenes of him talking on TV and being taken in are also a great part of it. As well as some people realizing that he is not seeing just as a comedian by people as he was in the beginning but that they actually like what he says. This is this nice transition of people being taken in but what they think is harmless entertainment and swallowing propaganda. We have also a great scene of the grandma looking at Hitler and recognizing him from the past which gives a comment on this with her remembering how at first people were also seeing him as harmless.Besides the main idea of the movie I also enjoyed some laughs at Hitler discovering the modern world. Especially him going to dry cleaning, watching TV and being upset over so many cook shows selecting the Greens as his favorite party and exploring the internet which he then sees as a great propaganda tool which it is.I guess I am just not too much into the very left wing bias which makes us think of every person who has any concerns and does not 100% agree with the left. Mind you I have never voted for the right wing. But I am irritated by every person leaning right being linked with Hitler. There is noting eye opening or revolutionary about it, it is the norm of today. Left propaganda is as real as the right one and I have felt a slight stench of it in this movie. I am interested in reading the book now because from what I have read it is not having those propaganda elements but is an intelligent book with a thought provoking message.But for the most part I liked the movie. It had it all together, a creative idea, good acting, fun and serious moments and a way to bring the view of the ones making it in a creative way."

The way to the destruction. Directly or gradually.This movie show us the possibility of ""How people may repeat terrible history again"" by a very clear way. Funny, bright, and reversed at the very end.I recommend people who care or be involved about race issue all should watch this movie. And ask yourself, ""Is getting rid of or destroy those no your kind really a good way?"" It always seems simpler, easier, but always brings more hate and harm as bloody history."
" Can't Win An Argument? Make Stuff Up

" A mediocre Borat/Bruno rip-off that doesn't understand the basics
",0.0,0.9928,2017-05-08 00:00:00,2,"Let me start by saying I haven't read the book, which from what I've heard is far more intelligent than this film. I'm also a liberal, therefore my criticisms of this film have nothing to do with it's targeting of conservatives, but of the film's misrepresentation of it's subjects and ineptitude in the film-making. I also am not a person who gets offended, I LOVE the concept and wish a better creative team had handled this idea.""Look Who's Back"" is clearly aping off the success of Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"", yet fails to realise what made those films great. 1st, the man who plays Hitler is mediocre, he is physically wrong for the part & not short as Hitler was, he towers over everyone else, which takes away completely from the comedy. He also lacks any improvisation skills, unlike Cohen, he never asks any challenging questions or manages to ""trap"" his victims, instead, the film heavily relies on cheap, dishonest editing.The editing is the worst aspect of the film. Not only is is poorly paced comedy- wise, but also dishonest and clearly misrepresents people interviewed. In his films, Cohen would stay with someone on screen for at least a minute, allow the viewers to become accustomed to them in unbroken, usually unedited takes, then Cohen would strike with a smart question perfectly tailored to that person. Here, interviewees are on screen for 10 seconds at the most, ensuring that all of their opinions are out of context. There is one man who literally says ""I'd be willing to take a bullet for my Germany"" and that's his only 3 seconds of screen time, because he is edited between 2 other people saying rather controversial things, the director is manipulating the viewers into concluding this man is a bigot, where he only said what anyone in the world would say about their country regardless of political persuasion. It's clear they had to resort to this choppy editing style due to none of their subjects were as horrible as they hoped; demonstrated by the montage, where we see snippets of dozens of improvised scenes, obviously not funny, that hit the cutting room floor.It's a tonally and stylistically confused mess. Whereas in the fore-mentioned films, the dramatised elements and mockumentary parts are interwoven perfectly. In ""Look Who's Back"", they constantly jump between styles, undermining our confidence in the realism of the supposed ""true"" moments.Because the leading role is a man playing Hitler, we can't trust answers given to him, as the vast majority of his subjects are being ironic as they give their answers, they're in on the joke, where Cohen's victims were not. There is a man early on who says that the solution to Germany's problem is ""Labor Camps"", which would be horrifying if there wasn't a probable chance he was taking the mickey, instead, he's on screen for 5 seconds, then never asked another question. There is nothing ""sobering"" or ""eye opening"" about anyone's opinion in this film, because everyone's opinion is tainted by the fact they are aware they are being interviewed by a comedian. The most egregious opinions are those of a few drunkards in a bar who are obviously playing up their ""devotion"" to ""Hitler"" as a joke, illustrated by the fact they are all laughing and taking photos of the actor, yet the film frames them as if they genuinely believe this. Also, every time they ask somebody about refugees, it frames every respondent that has a conflicting emotion towards the crisis as if they agree with a Hitler-Esque position. I hesitate to call any film morally reprehensible, but this film definitely rides that line in it's dishonestly and over-simplification.The non scripted scenes are the only ones that have an occasionally funny line, yet there's far too much, the side characters are dull, and it's unbelievable and contrived.The ending of the film is a ham-fisted ""twist"" where the message is crammed down our throats in the manner of a soap opera, as is most of the ""points"" the film is trying to make. The credits are particularly egregious, in suggesting Wilders and LePen are the modern equivalents to Hitler. While I dislike both those politicians, it is a reprehensible, simplistic and childish comparison from film-makers who are clearly virtue signaling. It's message is so melodramatic and self-important that it is unintentionally hilarious how pretentious it is.Tonally, ""look who's back"" doesn't know if it wants to be an edgy, a no holds barred offensive comedy, or a liberal think piece. It ends up as confused. I assume most of the positive reviews are from the kind of people who don't watch many foreign films, so whenever they see one, they praise it endlessly.P.S., the music in this film is all recycled from other better films (Dawn of the Dead) and uses THREE songs from A Clockwork Orange. Either use an original song, or use classical music that hasn't been so overplayed in the past. In so many respects, it feels like a film by a uni student."
" Surprise :D
",0.7297,0.899,2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"I expected nothing at all. I didn't even plan to watch it whole. Just wanted to see how it looks like, spend about 10 minutes watching it on fast forward and forget about it. Instead, I was hypnotized for the next two hours. Hitler wakes up in 2014 and tries to keep up with the world. You would expect comedy, right ?! But instead of laughter, I got a movie with a really serious message. From cinematography point of view, this could have been done much better, but it's worth your time and attention anyway.8/10"
" Promising Satire Falls Apart at End
",0.4019,0.3205,2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Recently caught this on Netflix. I like satirical comedy about taboo subjects. Got hooked by the movie's original preposterous premise, that Adolf Hitler, of all people, has been resurrected and returns to life to Berlin about 70 years after his suicide. For the first half of the movie the director has fun with this notion, although much of it is the amazement any person would have from post 20th century on in returning 70 years after their deaththe incredible inventions and technological breakthroughs that have come at a breakneck pace are mind boggling. There is also a similarity between ""LWB"" and ""Borat"" as this is done in a mockumentary style, as the citizenry in Germany react to the sight of a man who resembles and reacts as Hitler going through day to day like in modern Deutschland. Good enough and there are some funny and outrageous moments and Nazi Germany can be cleverly satirized, as Mel Brooks did with the ""Springtime for Hitler"" sequence in ""The Producers"" or as in the underrated 60's sit-com, ""Hogan's Heroes."" But ""LWB"" descends into a not so subtle comment into what the left perceive as racist xenophobia. That is the very real threat to Germany and virtually all of Western Europe of the invasion of Muslim refugees, who have absolutely no interest in assimilating into the prevailing culture. I might also add that if Hitler were to come back today he would find he shares a common conviction with most of the Muslim world. Absolute and complete anti-Semitism that can only be satisfied by extermination of the Jewish race."
" Brilliant, funny, but very scary
",-0.3377,0.9647,2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"How to make a comedy out of very tragic events and characters? Adrian Brody did it in ""Life Is Beautiful"" about life in a concentration camp. ""Look Who's Back"" does it via the premise that Adolf Hitler returns to modern day Germany. Of course everyone believes that he is an actor - one who disturbingly never steps out of character. The audience knows that he cannot - as he actually is Hitler. Much of the film is humorous as Hitler tries to reestablish himself as ""The Fuhrer"" and tries to understand and cope with modern day technology and attitudes.Oliver Masucci is brilliant as Hitler -playing the role so straight that he became very scary near the end. The brilliance of Hitler was aptly demonstrated as people began responding to the hate - filled rhetoric he employed on various television shows. In real life the industrialists supported Hitler because they were sure they could control him - they could not. The church supported him because they thought he would be useful to them and that they could control him - they could not. Finally the German Army threw in with him because they wanted to get rid of their rivals - Hitler's ""brown shirt"" Army - the Sturmabteilung (SA). He got rid of Strasser and Rohm and thousands of others as he dismantled the organization which carried him to power. But alas the Army also could not control him.In the movie, he becomes a media star because of viewership and ratings. We see glimpses of the audience saying like ""I think I agree with him, and he makes a lot of sense."" The TV moguls are building their careers on his outrageousness and resulting popularity.His grasp on people is creepy, insidious and feels quite realistic. This film shows you how riveting he could be - and gives you a glimpse into how he came to power. So, beyond laughs - the message clearly is that this could happen again. We must be aware of potential dictators in our midst. A few people in the movie saw that he really was Hitler - and they were discarded at the end of the movie.This movie is not a condemnation of Germany - past or present. Hitler in the movie postulates at the end of the film that we cannot get rid of him - because he is a part of us. I hope that is not true."
" Not bad but not great either
",-0.5448,0.9549,2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,Even though German is not the most pleasant language to listen to because it all sounds so aggressive all the time in this movie it works rather well because Adolf Hitler's speeches were also aggressive all the time. The movie itself is a dark comedy with sometimes a political view of modern society. It shows a lot of what is happening in Europe and what people complain about. Well at least what right wing people complain about and think about the situation because I couldn't care less about races and ethnicity's. You have good and bad people in all ethnicity's. The movie has some funny moments. I know I laughed a couple of times but for the majority of the movie I thought it was sometimes a bit long. Oliver Masucci as Adolf Hitler plays his role really good though. He has the physics and the perfect intonation in his voice to play Hitler. It's a good movie to watch once but I won't watch it a second time.
" A racist movie about the Germans
",-0.6124,-0.9924,2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Although I wanted to write a long description about this movie, I felt that it not deserves any description but this: The directors of this movie want convince the Germans once again that they are the most racist people on the planet, they are guilty of everything, and because of this they are not allowed to think about anything which happens around them. The only message of this movie is: Hitler lies in all of Germans like the seeds of the Devil, making them all a nation of evil. This is not different from the Nazi propaganda that the Jews are all parasites, who want to take over the world. It surprises me that those who think about themselves that they are democrats, anti racists and antifascists, hating all things related to these, like the producers of this movie, as I obviously understood after watching this film, do not notice that they are doing the same thing, what the Nazi propaganda had done against the Jews, Romanis and other minorities. But this time, they do it against the Germans, and this seems to be very OK, very PC for them! Watching this movie it is hard not to feel that some conspiracy theories are not conspiracy theories at all... I am feeling that this movies only purpose was to make the Germans to feel guilty, in order to make them fully receptive for the migrant invasion which was about to start, when the movie was made..."
" Horribly Crude movie with difficult concepts to watch
",-0.8625,0.665,2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"""Look who's back is a satirical comedy about Hitler waking up in modern day Germany around 70 years after his suicide. Once Hitler wakes up he immediately goes back to seeking power, though now he uses the media to do this instead of the government. I found this film incredibly hard to watch as Hitler was a horrible man and seeing him rise to power again made my very uncomfortable. The film starts out with Hitler interacting with regular people on the streets of Germany. Most people laugh, point and try to get pictures but some are very offended by him. Hitler works his magic with a man named Sawatski by going on talk shows and comedy shows and being himself completely. The public is under the assumption he is just a Hitler impersonator and they get a good kick out of watching him. The movie is very controversial as Hitler is one of the most hated men that's ever lived and by creating a movie about him it gives him more of a platform, whether it be good or bad. The movie keeps a light hearted tone though most of it until about the last thirty minutes. It turns dark very quickly. Sawatski finally figures out that Hitler is not an impersonator and that is is the real Hitler resurrected. He eventually gets put into a psych ward because people think he is crazy thinking what he does. But think about it, what would you do in Sawatski's shoes. You would probably go crazy as well. Looking at this movie cinematically it was done phenomenally! The camera angles were used in a way that really caused you to engage in the movie especially when they made it seem like you were looking at Germany through Hitler's eyes. The characters they cast to act in the movie were very convincing, especially Hilter's character. The only part I really liked about this movie was the cinematic sections. I disliked the concept and every action that Hitler made was cringe worthy and against the normal values I have (like him shooting a puppy). Overall ""Look Who's Back"" is not a movie for people that are really against Hitler's regime and who is was as it makes a comedy out of him coming back from the dead and rising to power for the second time."
" Forces one to ponder the integrity of the media
",0.3818,0.4027,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"""Look Who's Back"" is a phenomenal movie that utilizes a light and comical tone which is then contrasted by a dark and serious character, Adolf Hitler. This creates satire, allowing the movie to be especially impactful as it depicts pre-World War 2 ideas gaining support in a modern context, with the media having a key role in allowing one of the most tyrannous villains of human history to gain a platform to deliver his beliefs to the general public. Before I was introduced to the film I was forewarned of the dark message hidden under a thin layer of comedy. This warning did not fully prepare me for the unsettling way that Hitler was received by the German people. It brought to light how modern entertainment may often support controversial topics, as it interest's viewers. Hitler often delivers speeches laced with racism and sexism and is rarely contradicted through his journey to ""make Germany great again"". Adolf Hitler first rose to power as he promised to solve conflict, times were bad in Germany as a result of the post World War 1 repercussions and economic ties with the United States. Once in a position of power he delivered the public a scapegoat for Germanys many problems, he chose those of the Jewish religion. The movie parallels this situation in more modern context. Adolf chooses the government in power as the cause of economic problems and the apparent loss of pride of the ""original"" German population. He then chooses his scapegoat, the refugees of various countries that are experiencing conflict at the time. As his voice and influence increases over the course of the film, it becomes increasingly apparent that a section of the population agree with his ideals and are willing to support his ideals. I watched this movie just as the 2016 American presidential election came to its conclusion, with Donald Trump coming into power. The parallels that I found between Donald Trumps election campaign and Adolf Hitler's rise to power in ""look Who's Back"" were striking. Not only do they share a similar ""moto"", to make their respective country, but their utilization of media, to create crisis and create a need for change. The time line that ""look Who's back"" covered, did not show the legacy effects Hitler's ideals would have had on both Germany and the world. It is impossible to determine whether the population would prove to be immune to his hate inspiring speeches and would go on to forget him among the many other comedy acts or if his actions would create an anger so great no country could singularly avoid conflict. Likewise, the world shall experience the rise of Donald Trump as the leader of the most powerful country in the world, where will mankind be in five years? Ten years? Twenty years? Look whose back world."
