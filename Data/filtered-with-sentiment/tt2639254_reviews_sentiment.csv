" Very underrated film
",0.0,0.8396,2021-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely beautiful story. Really heartfelt and poignant that this was Alan Rickman's only second directorial feature, many years after his first. The dance sequence at the end...oh man, I'm in pieces."
" Characters, Costumes, and Setting = Beautiful Story
",0.5994,0.9231,2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"If you want an action packed plot, why are you watching a romance about gardening in the 17th century? These lovable and despicable characters face down their own personal anxieties and shortcomings collectively, from the lowest gardener to the King of France, to tell a touching, relaxing escape. A wonderful period piece."
" The Case of the Missing Tutorial
",-0.296,0.8865,2020-12-09 00:00:00,7,"A few explanatory lines - sadly missing from the script - are necessary because only the historically-minded (with some background in French history) will truly understand the theme.
Which is that all the primary characters are trapped.
Le Notre is trapped in a job he doesn't really enjoy.
Madame Le Barre trapped in guilt for an accident she believes she caused.
Louis XIV trapped in the vast expectations of his role as God King.
And most notably: nobles trapped at an elaborate and idle court.
This is where some knowledge of history is useful - understanding that Louis XIV understood that the only real danger to his dynasty was over-powerful nobles.
The king didn't want his aristocrats plotting against him, so he brought them to court: where they could be watched constantly and they would exhaust their incomes in expensive clothes and gambling.
If you don't understand Louis XIV's paranoia about his peers you can't understand what the courtier means when he tells Madame De Barre that the nobles are ""trapped like mice"".On a Marxist note: money for formal gardens didn't grow on trees back then either, so every facet of Versailles was built on the sweat and blood of nameless peasants who funded the gardens but would never be permitted to see the gardens.
The aristocrats walking through the greenery were free of taxes on the other hand - true parasites whose descendants roughly 150 years later were taken to the scaffold to have their heads struck off.
One of history's great corrections.Aside from all of the above, the film has some very effective moments as it walks along its ultra-predictable path.
Although the sturdy Kate Winslet who appears here cannot be mistaken for the much more petite Kate Winslet from ""Titanic""."
" Rickman project. it's pretty good!
",0.75,0.9386,2020-11-10 00:00:00,7,"A period piece, kind of. 1682... designing the gardens at Versaille. what might have happened. WAY before the peoples' uprising. the big name here seems to be Alan Rickman as King Louis. and Kate Winslet had been nominated for a bunch of her earlier works, and WON for Titanic! Mrs. DeBarra (Winslet) is one of the candidates to be the design artist for the royal gardens. not a lot of in depth character development, but we see the relationship between DeBarra, LeNotre, and LeNotre's wife. and some side plot about the politics of hiring just the ""right"" work crew to do the heavy lifting. was that the revenge of another architect not chosen? not quite sure what happened there. and so many things are up in the air when the Queen dies. a fun interlude where DeBarra mistakes the king for a gardener. but they have a very candid, pleasant talk. it's an interesting coincidence that this story with Louis XIV is about interactions with De Barre, while the Lucille Ball film DuBarry Was a Lady is about a relationship Louis XV ! Directed by Rickman himself! one of the two films he directed. it's actually good! tells a good story, doesn't get too deep in any one direction. Netflix. i'm surprised at the low ratings."

Not nearly as unrealistic as (here name any Quentin Tarantino movie). I'll take my fantasies of French history lush and filled with imagination and beauty. Every frame of this movie is a work of art."
" Nah...
",0.0,0.7776,2020-04-22 00:00:00,1,"UK-BBC recreation of France Louis XIV's period, through the creation of Versailles garden, this is a reminder that not everything the BBC does is a success.
Here, we have a really disappointing movie, in every aspect.Historically, the film shows nothing, even the Louis XIV shown looks completely out of time (and sorry for the Rickman fans but I did not believe in its acting on that character for once).
The social representation is non-existing and what we are shown could have been placed in a parallel universe all the same.There is almost no story, and even the building of the gardens is hardly shown.
Settings are non-impressive and even the actors seems to be trying their best not to drown with the movie. And when Kate Winslet is not enough to save a movie, that only says a lot!"
" Poorly chosen name!
",0.0,-0.5662,2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Hello! The reason this movie did so, and continues to do so badly is because of it's poorly chosen name. May I suggest ""The King's Garden"". (WTF, ""A Little Chaos!""? Is it some Teenie-Bop movie? No. Give it a title that this well done movie is entitled to.)"
" Maybe a little too Chaotic
",-0.4445,0.7684,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"It tried to do many things but didn't do any properly but 6/10 for great visuals, cinematography, exquisite costumes and the Gardens of Versailles."
" Really useful anachronisms?
",0.4927,0.9674,2020-01-27 00:00:00,4,"That's the question that comes up when you watch this movie...
A Louis XIV who seems to be 20 years older than Le Nôtre, when reality is the exact opposite...
The death of a Queen while the gardens are under construction, when in reality she died much later...
In short... I always find it difficult when you take real characters and turn them into a totally reinvented fiction.
What's the point? Might as well take the context, but inventing new characters...
I didn't understand the point of these anachronisms.All the more so as I expected a film concretely focused on the creation of the Versailles gardens, but in the end, the film is rather focused on the relationship between Le Nôtre and his ""assistant"", in the context of the gardens' creation.
If we stick to this subject, the film is not bad.But then, is there a need to take such well-known real historical characters and make a cocktail of so many anachronisms, to tell the love story between a ""Master"" and his muse in the 17th century?If not, has no one yet had the idea of making a film about the affair between Vauban and Josephine de Beauharnais during the french revolution under Henri IV? Has anyone ? (irony, yes of course...)"
" Beautiful, but lacks purpose
",0.3506,0.9287,2019-12-13 00:00:00,5,"While I enjoyed watching this movie, I felt that in general the story felt like it lacked depth. There's so much going on, that nothing gets the focus. The garden, the starving artists, the king, the consorts, theres just too much going on. However the cinematography and costuming are astoundingly beautiful. A pleasure to the eye, that doesn't hold up under scrutiny."
" Unimpressed
",-0.34,0.1538,2019-07-05 00:00:00,6,"A fairly predictable storyline about a woman overcoming the odds of the time period, relationship boundaries and job stereotypes in her time. I was very unimpressed (actually disappointed) with the costuming and hair for both Madame de Barra and King Louis, as well as many other characters in the time period. Wrong silhouettes, not enough adornments, missing headdresses etc. etc. really detracted from the period setting of the piece. If you would like a similar (but better) look into 18th century French court gardens, I recommend Vatel."
" The garden of Versailles
",0.0,0.987,2019-06-13 00:00:00,5,"In this historical drama, co-written, directed, and starring Alan Rickman, the gardens of Versailles are designed and constructed to please King Louis XIV. Even though he isn't technically the lead, Alan's much more commanding presence makes you think he is, since the real male lead isn't very memorable. Matthias Schoenaerts is the head architect, and despite his misgivings about hiring a lady landscaper who doesn't have as much regard for order as he does, he hires Kate Winslet to build a rock fountain formation.The parts of the film that show the designs and work on the gardens are incredibly interesting. If the entire movie was really about working on the gardens, like the synopsis hints at, it would have been much better. However, a romance is thrown in between Kate and Matthias. He's married to Helen McCrory, but her philandering ways have made for a strained and open marriage. She's still very possessive, and if you think she might try to sabotage Kate's work, you might be right. Stanley Tucci plays Alan's brother, and while it's fun to see him throw out some funny one-liners, it's more fun just to know he's still cranking out the movies.My favorite scene was the scene most audience members probably anticipated the highest as well: a reunion between Marianne and Colonel Brandon. Twenty years after Sense and Sensibility, it's a bit of a disappointment that they're not paired up as love interests together, but they do share a couple of scenes in A Little Chaos. In the first, he's resting in a garden, and she doesn't recognize him. She mistakes him for a gardener and they talk as equals, until she finally figures it out and bows. It's a cute scene, and I wish they had more shared screen time.You can check this movie out if you want to see some exquisite costumes and realistic grimy working conditions. It's a far cry from a documentary on the gardens of Versailles, and neither the romance nor Kate's dramatic backstory is very interesting, but there are some good points."
" Compelling and Entertaining
",0.5859,0.8721,2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Until now, I've never seen Kate Winslet portray a character in any movie that I could connect with. I've always thought she was miscast in Titanic. In A Little Chaos though, she draws us out n, bit by bit, by showing a great deal of vulnerability, a person bruised, but not quite broken by her paifully past. I could not hold back thevtears when she finally faces what haunts her. Good movie about a gentle soul trading a potentially treacherous path in life, willing to reach for what seems barely possible."
" WINSLET SCORES AGAIN
",0.0,0.9429,2019-04-22 00:00:00,7,"A LITTLE CHAOS takes us to another country, France, and to another time, the 17th century. King Louis XIV (excellently portrayed by Alan Rickman who also directed and co-wrote), decides to build Versailles and entrusts the designing of its extensive gardens to his chief gardner, Andre Le Notre (Matthias Schoenaerts). In turn Le Notre hires Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet) to construct a 'rock garden' for the site (the title refers to the fact that classic French gardens are well-ordered but Madame De Barre introduces a little chaos) . While this is an English movie, it does take place in France so we know that a large part of the plot has to do with romances of various kinds and, again because it is France, deceptions. The acting is top notch (Stanley Tucci pops up and steals every scene he is in and the excellent Helen McCrory shows why we'd love to see more of her) the screenplay is excellent and the cinematography is to die for. Did we mention that Kate Winslet gives another superb nuanced performance? If for nothing else, watch it for that."
" Lovely but historically inaccurate
",0.34,-0.25,2019-04-02 00:00:00,6,"Although a lovely film, I always have a bit of an issue when history is distorted
I also thought it was a shame that none of the movie was filmed in Versailles or its garden"
" Beautiful
",0.5994,0.311,2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"For me, A Little Chaos is very poetic. It's a story of a gardener, and I find the quote about how gardeners are here to find a small garden of Eden so beautiful. It's the story of a mother struggling with the loss of her beloved child and finding a way to recover, her guilt at moving on from her now dead husband. I don't know how anyone could find the boring, it's truly beautiful!"
" A love story and a way to better know the gardener André Le Notre
",0.7964,0.9545,2019-03-05 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie because I had to write a tale about the famous french gardener André Le Notre. I found it interesting, altough his real story is combined with fiction. I don't know if the relation with his gardener (Kate Winslet) was true, but I liked it and I also liked the way in which Le Notre is described.
Some parts are a bit distant from the reality, especially the figure of Louis XIV, but in conclusion it is a nice movie and an interesting story about Versailles."
" boring and rather unaccomplished
",-0.3182,0.9279,2019-03-02 00:00:00,3,"Tempted by a great cast to watch this, I only stayed till the end of the film because it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion, showing in slightly off costumes and much fuss about boringness. Alan Rickman's second film as an ""auteur"" (director, writer, actor) 27 years after his first feature feels rather failed - and tired. Good for him that the BBC produced this film and that he (or the producers) was able to cast such great actors. I kind of liked that they irreverently told a story of a woman in a men's world, but Rickman and his two co-authors didn't know how to use the potential of their anachronistic set-up. The only thing they could conceive of was a little machination and shy romance. Oh boy, are the dialogues bland, and the direction is uninspired, too. Sorry, Alan! Even Matthias Schoenaerts, who I admired so much in ""Bullhead"", was lacklustre. His character has few potentials, thus he has even fewer expressions than Tom Cruise in all of his filmography: one single sulking pout. The only salvation in this film was the spirited and warm Kate Winslet."
" Beautifully Made
",0.5719,0.9828,2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie just gets better every time I watch it. The first time I didn't get all the nuances but I find myself getting pulled into the character's lives and complexities. Kate Winslet plays a Gardner of Versailles who is still reeling from a personal tragedy when she steps into the eccentric and elaborate world of palace life in Versailles. I find there is a beautiful comparison is this movie between how a Gardner shapes his plants and how we shape one another and our responses to our environments as we grow and change. Beautifully done with a gorgeous soundtrack to boot. If you love movies that speak to the inner spaces and capture the beauty and pain of real life, you will love this."
" A Quiet But Beautiful Period Romance Movie
",0.9052,0.9255,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"9 October 2015. Alan Rickman has directed a quaint period piece that has a quiet romance all over it in using a rather different plot. There is Royal intrigue and yet its depicted in a stylistic way that avoids the harsh dramatic trappings so often used in period movies which as mysterious and dark Black Death (2010) or the more harsh deeper psychological drama of Patrice Laconte's The Widow of Saint-Pierre (2000), or the fame of brilliance and unusual genius in Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984).This movie has some resemblance to the lushness of Mike Newell's Enchanted April (1991). Rickman has brought the rarified dignity and the class distinction of royalty to the fore in its perhaps royal perspective of a king and the isolated journeywoman's viewpoint of a female landscape artist. Even in comparison to Laurent Tirard's Moliere (2007) and its traditional plot, A Little Chaos offers a greater challenge of presenting an engaging little drama that has little in the way of huge, splashy plot themes, except a King's desire for an elegant contribution to his Royal grounds as a backdrop to a rather less than noticeable relationship on the big screen. The best comparison might be the superb upsetting and serio-tragedy of Terence Davies' The House of Mirth (2000) for it brilliance of despair as Rickman as brought an elegance and happiness to the big screen.The only weakness that develops in the film is the inclusion of perhaps one or two more characters whose contributions don't really add to the film but actually take previous time away from the main characters and the infusion of even more depth to their performances."
" A slow gardener's tale in the reign of Louis XIV
",0.0,0.9763,2018-11-12 00:00:00,6,"""A Little Chaos"" is a period costume drama based on a simple fictional plot. It is set in 1682-1683 during the reign of King Louis XIV. A female ""builder"" is chosen to create a special project in the royal gardens at Versailles. A romance develops over time between she and the master gardener, the architect of Versailles, who chose her for the task.Most of the performances are fine, but nothing special. Many of the characters seem wooden in the scenes in the royal household. The three main characters are Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet), André Le Notré (Matthias Schoenaerts), and King Louis (Alan Rickman). Rickman directed the film but doesn't seem to be able to coax any spark out of most of the characters.The story moves between Madame De Barra's landscaping work, and her awkward introduction to the court of the king and royal society. In between that, her acquaintance with the master builder, Le Notré, evolves into a romance. Some of the women of the royal household add interest to the story, but much of the king's huge entourage is portrayed as a den of ladies of rank with male courtesans. This seems a curious twist that doesn't add much to the main plot. Of course, without that the film would have needed something else to fill the time slot.But for the scenery, costumes and excellent camera work, ""A Little Chaos"" would be a royal bore for most.While several of the characters are historically true, Madame De Barra and others are fictional. Le Notré was the landscape architect for King Louis. He began designing and building the gardens at Versailles in 1661, but he would have been 70 years old in 1683. The king's wife who died that year was Maria Theresa of Spain (1638-1683). She and Louis married in 1660 when they were both 21. She was 44 when she died on July 30, 1683.Louis XIV was also known as Louis the Great. He had the longest sovereign reign in European history. It lasted from May 14, 1643 (when he was four years old) until his death at age 76 on Sept. 1, 1715. He began his personal rule of France in 1661 at age 18, after the death of his chief minister, the Italian Cardinal Mazarin. Louis reigned 72 years and 110 days. Scholars consider him one of the greatest rulers in history.Besides his military and other conquests, King Louis XIV was also a royal philanderer. He is known to have fathered at least 22 children, six by his first wife, Maria Theresa.Within a year of his first wife's death, Louis again married. His second wife was Francoise d'Aubigné, the Marquiese de Maintenon. She is Francoise Marie in the movie, played by Hope Hancock. Perhaps the most powerful woman in the king's entourage though, was Francoise-Ahtenais, the Marquise de Montespan. She bore Louis seven children from 1669 to 1678. Jennifer Ehle plays her in the movie. At least four other women bore nine children by Louis. All of these 22 offspring were legitimized by the king in time.When Louis married again in 1683, he was 44 years old and his known philandering ended. The Marquises de Maintenon was a devout Catholic and had a strong influence on the king becoming more devout himself.Without knowing something of the history and the court surrounding Louis XIV, much of this film set in the king's household is meaningless. A little knowledge of these people and of the reign of King Louis XIV adds some interest to this film. Otherwise, this is a slow movie, with much doting on flowers, other plants and landscaping. While gardeners may enjoy this, many others may find it boring."
" A little charmer
",0.3832,0.9969,2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Love period dramas. Am a big fan of Alan Rickman, one of the biggest acting inspirations of my childhood (mostly for Snape in the 'Harry Potter' films and 'Sense and Sensibility', but getting older love even more in 'Die Hard' playing one of the greatest screen villains). Also wanted how he would fare in his second film as director. The concept sounded nice enough and the cast (with Kate Winslet, Stanley Tucci, Matthias Schoenaets, Helen McCrory and Rickman himself) are immensely talented.'A Little Chaos' is one of those films that has people liking it but judging from the mixed critical reception it is one of those films that hasn't clicked with everybody. It is not hard to see why. It may not be a consistent film. It may not be a remarkable film. It may not be great. For me though, 'A Little Chaos' was a little charmer with many great things and enough to be enchanted by. Couldn't help feeling emotional too, knowing that it was one of Rickman's last roles and projects, 2015's very good 'Eye in the Sky' being his last (he's excellent in that), before his ultimely death two years ago.Getting the flaws out of the way, there are parts that drag a little and are a little muddled as a result of the story being very slight with not an awful lot to it. Did find too that the romantic chemistry between Winslet and Schoenaerts didn't convince. There are parts where it is nice enough but there is never enough passion and it doesn't really bloom in development. Schoenaerts being more engaged would have helped things, found him a little too low-key on occasions in his scenes with Winslet. Which is a shame because his performance is otherwise quite dignified and sympathetic and is actually much more animated and passionate in the more dramatic scenes with McCrory. Their chemistry did have intensity, and in a fiery sense making for some highlight scenes, lifted quite significantly by the atypically venomous performance of McCrory. All the other performances are without complaints too, with the radiant and touching Winslet coming out on top. Rickman is suitably droll and very amiable while Tucci is delightfully flamboyant.Visually, 'A Little Chaos' looks wonderful. The exquisite and evocative costumes and the stunningly picturesque buildings and scenery are a feast for the eyes beautifully shot. The music score is pleasant and harmonious with the atmosphere. There is a nice mix of subtle droll comedy, poignant emotion and tense drama, while the script is uneven and with not an awful lot of substance it is at least coherent and thoughtful. The story mostly compels despite its slightness, Rickman being mistaken for the head gardener is a highlight and Sabine is written with heart. Rickman directs quite adeptly.Overall, inconsistent but charming. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

" A Little Chaotic. A Lot Dull.
",-0.6534,0.8646,2018-08-04 00:00:00,4,"I LOVE costume dramas, yet not all costume dramas are created equally. And though I would hate to criticize the directing of the wonderful Alan Rickman, whose performance in this movie was creditable, I would like to say that the movie was dis-jointed and dull. Partly because I felt that Kate Winslet's character had very few responses beyond confused or sleepy. With a female protagonist, you need to feel that you can either relate to her or, at the very least, understand her behavior. I could not relate to the sleepy, confused character portrayed by Winslet (and I do like her very much). I understand that she discovered/announced that she was pregnant during filming and I wonder if perhaps she was simply nauseous! That might explain everything!Everyone else in this film is excellent. I loved each and every character and the performances shone more brightly because Winslet was so dull. This is not based on a true story, so there's nothing interesting there. It was simply kind of meh."
" A big waste of time
",-0.4215,0.9553,2018-03-08 00:00:00,3,"One of the last big films that Alan Rickman was involved in before his untimely death, A LITTLE CHAOS was also directed by the famous British actor, although his direction is middling at best. This is a low key romance set in the court at Versailles under Louis XIV, the Sun King, played by Rickman himself in support. The main thrust of the story is a romance between gardener Kate Winslet and a landscape artist in the king's employ. I found the whole thing hard to swallow. The romantic scenes feel cheesy and overblown and Winslet walks around with a funny expression on her face the whole time, like she's just smelt something terrible. The film's setting is sufficiently opulent and the supporting cast isn't bad, although I wish more had been made of strong actors like Jennifer Ehle and Danny Webb who are little more than window dressing."
" The aren't many great gardening fantasies. There may be a reason for that.
",-0.5096,0.9557,2018-03-04 00:00:00,5,"The late Alan Rickman directed and co-starred in this curiopusly pointless film; it was one of his last projects. At heart, it's a deeply conventional (and conservative) period love story, with Kate Winslett playing a feisty, talented gardener trying to prove herself and find happiness in the perfidious world of the French royal court. Fortunately for her, she wins the mind of the king, and (in spite of some shennanigans) everything turns out beautiful and happy-ever-after. I've rarely seen a less class-conscious movie: I may not like the politics of Jane Austen, but at least she's aware of class as an issue; but this film is a banal tribure to talented women and the glory of Versailles. It's a waste of the cast, who act their parts but have little of interest to show us."

Her work defies conventions of the time and Madame Sabine falls for the master designer André Le Nôtre even though she is haunted by her past.The film was directed by Alan Rickman, who also co-wrote it and plays the Sun King. The problem is this is a slight tale and boring. It actually could had done by being more chaotic and wilder.Winslet has little chemistry with Matthias Schoenaerts, she does better when she bumps into King Louis who pretends to be a gardener."
" A period piece that felt like it was of period (enough)
",0.3612,0.8824,2018-03-02 00:00:00,9,"The setting of the movie is appropriately 18th century, the way the characters act so too. They even seem to speak (mostly) like it too: sometimes they construct long, florid sentences, and sometimes the king takes his wig off and talks about money.It is not a glitzy romance, because the romance is suitably subtle (it thus also reflects the period). The romance is conducted, until near the end, almost entirely in subtext. Is it a perfect picture of 18 century France? Probably not, but, like the Gardens of Versailles, which are the true main character of this thoughtful drama, they have enough rough edges to feel real."
" Precious gem of a movie
",0.5719,0.9931,2017-10-06 00:00:00,8,"A rare gem in the world of contemporary movies, this story has sympathetic characters. I thought they all but disappeared from the screen. It is purely fictional, but I like to believe it could have happened. Schoenaerts plays Andre Le Notre, the real landscape architect who designed the park of Versailles for King Louis XIV. Andre is interviewing other landscape gardeners to help him with the job, among them the only woman, fictional Sabine De Barra (Winslet).They don't meet so cute, but Le Notre is intrigued and Sabine is hired. In the society of the time, Sabine is a bit of a low class oddity who manages to make friends in high places. Admitted to court, she attracts attention and curiosity for her beauty and skills, but she also attract Le Notre's wife jealousy.Le Notre is unhappily married with his unfaithful Madame, but Madame is well connected at court and sort of blackmails him into staying with her. However, that will not stop the slowly burning romance between Andre and Sabine. Sabine holds back not only because Andre is married but also because of her mysterious tragic past.We finally get to know Sabine's sad history during one of the most moving scenes of the film. Sabine talks to the court ladies and discovers that they also share tragic losses, although at court it is forbidden to talk about death. Once able to face her past, Sabine can finally move into her future.Winslet is really good as Sabine and Schoenaerts seems particularly gifted for the role of the strong, silent, lover. He had similar roles in The Danish Girl and Suite Francaise and was equally good. Their scenes together are moving and tender, without any of the artificial slickness or aggressiveness of contemporary romances.Rickman playing Louis XIV as a rather melancholic man who takes a fatherly fancy to Sabine. The music is not overbearing period and the costumes are absolutely fantastic. The final scene looks like is taking place in the real, still existing, rock ballroom. Great movie, a balm for the soul."
" Alan Rickman's film of lovely moments
",0.5859,-0.8375,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"Alan Rickman is one of the many talents we lost in 2016 and this was one of the few films he directed.It's not a fantastic film, more a collection of good moments that sadly never join up, but you can't fault Rickman or Kate Winslet, who shine when on screen.It was released in a year with a lot of other similar films, and perhaps that hurt it in terms of acclaim, as did the fact that the plot isn't the easiest to explain, but as I say, there are certainly moments within it that make it worth a watch.We miss Alan Rickman terribly."
