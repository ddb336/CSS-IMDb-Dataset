" Bone chilling!!
",-0.1739,-0.5209,2021-04-12 00:00:00,9,The acting in this movie is brilliant. I FELT that eviction scene right down to my gut it was so real and heartbreaking. You forget you're watching a movie and not actually people getting evicted from their life long home by force.
" Liked it all except the ending
",0.4215,0.8481,2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,"The actor's were great, Shannon, Garfield and Dern and I thought it was a compelling drama to follow. We follow a man that's trying to survive and find a way to take care of his family. It started to feel a bit unrealistic and contrived towards the end with the family's reaction and then the big happening at the very end..."
" Insightful but loses steam by the end...
",-0.4497,0.9955,2021-03-26 00:00:00,6,"After Ramin Bahrani impressed me with The White Tiger, I decided to check out 99 Homes. Whilst I don't like this one as much, it's still an interesting film.99 Homes follows Dennis Nash, a construction worker, who takes up a job working for Rick Carver, a ruthless real estate broker, who evicted Nash and his family from his home in the first place.Films like these tend to not interest me but seeing Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield together got me excited. 99 Homes is a devastating look at the housing market crash that took place in 2008 and shows the corruption and greed that takes place within this business. Scenes where we see people being evicted out of their homes are painful to watch. Bahrani executes these scenes by not overly dramatising them but rather giving us a gritty and unfiltered look at these situations which I found really effective. The opening alone is fantastic as we get a long take eviction sequence that sets the tone of the film well. Bahrani does well setting up the characters and story but personally I found myself getting less invested by the end. It lacked that gripping feeling a drama should have.The performances are excellent from everyone involved. Michael Shannon is easily the best part of the film. His role as the corrupt Rick Carver is fascinating to watch and Shannon does a brilliant job playing this character. I've been following Andrew Garfield for a long time now and it amazes me the variety of roles he takes on. He delivers yet another great performance here as a man struggling to provide for his family. Laura Dern is also great as Garfield's mother in the film.Bahrani is able to get great performances from these actors and directs some emotionally upsetting scenes with skill. I wish the second half was executed in a better way. It began to get predictable and the ending was a bit of a letdown but 99 Homes is an interesting insight into the corruption of this field of work and how people profit off it."
" Great acting, great movie for the times!
",0.8588,0.991,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Those who complain about this movie are maybe looking for another kind of movie that explores deeper societal issues surrounding the story being told in more of a documentary style perhaps. Sure, the realities are different for those impacted by the housing crisis (there are many deadbeat tenants and unreasonable risk takers for sure), but there are many who were taken advantage of by a system set up to benefit the rich and many others who are not so rich who had skin in the real estate game. But as a movie, this is about as solid as it gets. It reminds me of another great movie in some ways, the original Wall Street. Great story, great acting, and a dramatic ending that drives the point home. Not sure why some feel it is a Hallmark ending or that it goes too far with the dramatic elements - it felt realistic to me given all the main character was dealing with. I think the movie did a great job exploring the fuzzy line that exists between good vs. evil and the tough decisions some have to make to try to remain human. The only knock, as another reviewer noted, is not using the awesome talents of Laura Dern as much as they could have. Overall, highly recommended!"
" A Superb Exposé of the Home Foreclosure Industry and the broken lives left in it's wake. A Must Watch.
",0.128,-0.2558,2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Ramin Bahrani's (The Director's), take on 2000's Home Fore-Closures by the Bank(s) - (Screenplay - Amir Naderi); is an incisive and relentless Exposé on the mechanics and inner workings of an 'industry' that takes people out of their homes and dumps them onto the street. There are 6 principal characters in this drama. The home-owner (with family), the enforcement officers (sheriff), the foreclosure-agent (with team), the court; and two others. One of these two is known to most as the Banker or Banks, or financial institution(s). The other of these two (most probably unknown to most); are high level speculators who trade in real-estate forclosures on a wholesale scale. This story's impact is based on a coherent and itelligent telling of how these characters experience their roles in this Human Drama. Human Drama which centres on a basic fundamental need for shelter, for a place, and for a home. It also thankfully plays to the message that human beings despite overwhelming coersion, do actually have a choice about how they respond to injustice, and the choice(s) they make in the face of this challenge, can and do; Make A Difference. Essential Viewing."
" America Does Not Bail Out The Losers.
",-0.5267,0.9041,2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"America was built by bailing out winners. By rigging a nation, of the winners, for the winners, by the winners.Most of us have been sold the dream that owning your own home is the paradise we all strive for. Mortgages from banks make this available to middle class citizens. Yet when unemployment rises and those citizens can't pay that mortgage, well, that's where Rick Carver, portrayed by Michael Shannon, comes in.This movie is a dark depiction of the ugly side of real estate. Average people losing their homes, their safety, their lives. Leaving with nothing to show for it. Often because they were convinced to borrow more than they could afford. Other times simply due to misfortune. Does Rick Carver care? Oh no. Carver is an absolute savage. Cold and calloused. Unforgiving in his pursuit of wealth. Letting no sob story stand in his way. Dennis Nash (Garfield) is snagged up into Carver's web of deceit, fraud, and lies, in his own pursuit to regain what he lost.This movie examines how easy it is for greed to consume even the best of us. Amazing film with stellar performances by Shannon and Garfield."
" A scathing ex post facto indictment in Biden's America.
",0.0,0.8402,2021-02-26 00:00:00,7,"To brchthethird: This is actually a scathing ex post facto indictment in Biden's America. Beijing Biden, aligned with Communist China, will try to destroy America to the degree where Americans will be evicted from their homes on a large scale, like depicted in this movie here. President Trump empowered people, so that they could achieve the American dream by actually purchasing a house and keeping it. Beijing Biden on the other hand, who in his first month, tried to undo everything President Trump did for American citizens, wants every American citizen to be homeless, just like all the Democrat cities across the nation are like. Massive homelessness in top democrat run cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, St. Louis, Baltimore, Atlanta, San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia,etc.... but I digress, this was a good movie, but did not have a very good ending. It would have been nice to see the bad guy prosecuted."
" Lost me with a major plot flaw
",-0.3182,0.7227,2020-11-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie lost me at 1hr 29m when the option of moving to another motel to wait out the 3 weeks till the family could move into their family home was amazingly never an option. Everything after 1hr 29min is a total waste of time. This should have been a caper movie not a heist movie. By that I mean it should have gone the way of the hero, except that he should have been an anti hero who profited from the GFC but then returned his gains to the victims in ways that both secured his and his families wellbeing but also putt victims like himself on the road to recovery."
" Awful movie
",-0.4588,-0.0397,2020-10-05 00:00:00,5,Hard to believe so many people writing that this was enjoyable to watch. It was not.I could not finish watching this movie. Terrible to watch people bring evicted from their homes in such a callous manor with their only belongings being dumped outside in the front yard. Could not watch such cruelty
" If you think nobody cares if you are alive, try missing a couple of mortgage payments
",0.5267,-0.8488,2020-09-16 00:00:00,5,"What a depressing film this was. Mrs. Shullivan and I are big fans of Michael Shannon and I must say he provided another standout performance. Having said that, Michael Shannon plays a high achieving real estate broker named Rick Carver who is a despicable human being who seems to relish foreclosing on families who miss a few mortgage payments. His cringe worthy tactics even include faking that the houses he has foreclosed on had their Heating and Air Conditioning units stolen so that he can claim the losses that he falsely created.Andrew Garfield plays Dennis Nash, a down on his luck carpenter who is a single dad living with his own mother in his childhood home. That is, he was living in his childhood home until Rick Carver gives Dennis, Dennis's mother and his son the boot when he forecloses on the house.To recover from this downward financial spiral, Dennis agrees to work directly for Rick Carver and gradually he becomes just like the man he so despised. So the two of them continue to boot other families out of their homes and foreclose on them which is why I felt this picture has no redeeming values, is very depressing and a waste of a good talent in Michael Shannon. I have never been a fan of Andrew Garfield so his character which was the most depressing of the entire cast and my exasperated look said it all. Enough already. Too depressing of a film.I give it a 5 out of 10 IMDB rating and I would have rated it lower except Michael Shannon saved the film with another fine performance."
" Good acting but lack of depth
",-0.25,0.6202,2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,"Great acting and directing, but too single-sided/simple plot for me. No surprises and too easy to figure out the end early on. Everything was just around one thing, family didn't have important enough role/depth, for example."
" Ok movie, annoying at times
",-0.128,-0.5216,2020-08-28 00:00:00,4,"This movie was a great idea but gets annoying at times. They have issues that would never be issues in real life. Why does Nash (Andrew Garfield) always want to surprise his family with big decisions that effect all of them? Would a real life mom have said no to the house he offered her knowing it wasn't stolen? Why would he fight with the big guy he evicted knowing it's the law and could have just called the police. He knew what the job was about, he gets the money to fix his situation and now has remorses. Michael Shannon is always great but can Andrew Garfield close his mouth sometimes? He is a terrible actor who over acts most of the time.
The end of the movie gets unbelievable and feels rushed. (No spoilers).
And dialogues get dumb. ""Nobody is gonna tell me the sun is not shining"" was that supposed to be deep?."
" Andrew Garfield is amazing
",0.5859,0.9422,2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"It's not very subtle and it gets very repetitive, but it makes up for it with a fantastic performance by Andrew Garfield and a great, if extremely melodramatic climax.Michael Shannon is too overtly evil for there to be any nuance (and he keeps talking about handjobs for some reason), but he still gave a very entertaining performance. However, it is Andrew Garfield who carries the whole movie with one of his best performances."
" Well done. Liked it
",0.5994,-0.9236,2020-08-10 00:00:00,8,Harsh critic of the US mortgage delinquency foreclosures that do not care about the social awful consequences. Sometimes people are prone to be ripped off by a greedy shark who in his quest to increase his business profits harm them and at the same time cheat the Government. Fast paced with dramatic scenes that turn it into a thriller. Good acting performances
" It happened quickly
",0.0,0.9598,2020-07-17 00:00:00,6,"First of all, the movie was good, acting is beautiful, both (Andrew Gerfield) and (Michael Shannon), and the first 40 minutes of the film are very beautiful, the first 40 minutes gave you enthusiasm and excitement for what will happen in the next, but what happened later is not what I was Expected the story is beautiful, but it ended quickly and the events that happened later were able to increase in detail and the voids that took place were completed, they could have done more, but the events were unfortunately repeated. The story is strong, but its presentation to the viewer was somewhat weak. And the end, what did you shock me in the end or made me say what a beautiful end is for sure? No, you made me say what happened now. Finally, I am telling you the movie is not what you expected"
" Interesting insight into an American air-con racket....
",0.4019,-0.9499,2020-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Now there can be little arguing that Andrew Garfield - even without the big hair - is a good looking man whom the camera very much likes. That does not, however compensate for the fact that he is a a truly mediocre actor - and this film, sadly, displays that in spades. He (""Nash"") is a single father living with him mum (Laura Dern) but he loses his job on a construction site. The bank forecloses and when the bailiffs arrive they are quite literally checked out onto the street by the police and a rather avaricous, ruthless realtor ""Rich Carver"" (Michael Shannon). Desparate to get his family back home, he ends up doing odd jobs for his nemesis and gradually that expands until he is little better than a mini-me version; just as cruel and insensitive to an increasing number of victims of unemployment and bad luck. The story doesn't hang around, but I was puzzled by just how quickly the resolutely defiant Garfield character turned native, and the implausible haste with which this happened really robbed this of any sense of realism. Shannon is quite good as the malevolent exploiter, but there no real contributions from Dern and the ending is really quite predictably poor."
" Evicting is not a crime
",0.431,0.4215,2020-05-19 00:00:00,5,Laim movie. Builds a whole drama in people just doing a simple and legal job. In the end puts a forging document out of the blue on the situation just to close the movie and pretend the whole drama is justified

" Good apart from the unnecessary ending
",0.4404,0.9657,2019-11-10 00:00:00,7,"'99 Homes' is an impactful drama film covering the sensitive topic of house repossession/eviction. It does a good job at portraying events as they occur in real-life and benefits from a highly convincing acting performance from Andrew Garfield as main character Dennis. The film is engaging and effective at getting its point across without being forceful or manipulative.That is, until the 'showdown' at the end. After succeeding in its subtle, realistic, matter-of-fact approach throughout, I don't know why they then decided to end with something that is the complete opposite. It's unnecessary and doesn't add anything to the storyline or film as a whole.Fortunately, it is only a short ending and it doesn't overshadow what is otherwise a very good film. Overall, '99 Homes' is a realistic, gripping drama that does a good job at handling a tricky topic."
" Excellent film

" Should have been better.
",0.4404,0.8071,2019-10-14 00:00:00,4,"99 Homes has the premise, but little sense and morality.The ending fails to resonate, as Dennis has already sided with the enemy, doing what was done to him. It's impossible to connect with him. He's capable of handling any task it seems, but this his only option, I think not. The dialogue's weak and there just isn't enough rage encapsulated for the situation. Michael Shannon though, plays the sleazeball as good as anyone."

" It Could Have Been Good Except For The Script
",0.4404,0.8208,2019-06-21 00:00:00,5,"99 HomesThis was a very strange movie as it straddled several stories and themes and ended up becoming mired in subplots rather than tackling a central theme.The themes it looked at were1, when ordinary people fall on hard times the banks evict you without mercy2, eviction attracts sharks who smell the money and make a living out of misfortune3, where does personal morality lay when you have to support your family anyway you can.Unfortunately none of these were tacked well despite a star studded cast. There was no redemption or resolution, we felt sympathy for the destroyed lives on the screen but were weren't led to any sunny upland.I would add a personal observation here, I have seen every movie Andrew Garfield has ever made, he is perhaps one of the leading actors of his generation, and yet he is either under-utilised or there is a poor script. Hacksaw Ridge was brilliant but this kind of script comes rarely. He does not fit well in Hollywood, with his intense, geeky, nerdy and idiosyncratic style. Firstly he needs another franchise so he gets the scripts and he would have more suitable work this side of the Atlantic. It is not so shocking to see Heathcliffe or Darcy or indeed a detective in Line of Duty."
" Evicting people for living.
",0.0,0.1043,2019-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Basically, the movie sheds a light on the ruthless system and pitiless courts of the US and how corrupted businessmen and brokers take advantage of that. The flm focuses mainly on the eviction and foreclosing on properties process so much that it makes you feel anxious. The depiction of the dismissal is done well enough to makes you imagine being kicked out of your only house that shelters you and your family the shock of being tossed into the street is impactful. The first half of the film got hold of my attention more than the second half due to the dramatic tension scenes, the last half focuses on unexpected events that follow the eviction of a family consists of three members it is indeed a solid and an exemplary thriller film... Regarding the performance, both stars acted magnificently despite challenging roles. The film will not fail to keep you engaged because of its momentum I think it's a narrative of what happened to the real-estate market when the economic crisis hit in 2008 If you like to see a tense story much drama, this should be your selection. The director did a fantastic job to grab audiences' heed however the ending in some way fell short. The ramifications of the implacable capital system is straying good people like the blue-collar worker ""Dennis Nash"" into reluctantly doing wrong actions."

",0.5719,0.8544,2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"04/08/2019 There's so many real life lessons in this movie it's hard to choose.
# 1. Wealth and $$$'s do not guarantee happiness and peace of mind. # 2. Sometimes less is more and knowing that the words ""want & need"" are polar opposites. Knowing the difference can make or break a person, their family, their lives. Not everybody understands that simple difference. The wealthy for the most part, do not share with family outsiders and the human emotions of kindness, compassion and empathy are just words to be used to mirror decency, not the truthful rules for a foundation of living a full and wholesome life. Great movie that reflects reality, sadly. Bon Appetit"

" American Cannibalism - 99 Homes
",0.0,0.2957,2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"When we were children, we were taught right from wrong by our parents. Sometimes, when we got older, we forgot some of those lessons. This film reminds us of the difference. When the legal system teams up with the banking system and the private sector in the real estate market, you can pretty much expect that those lessons will not be remembered. I remember 1000s of foreclosures by the beginning of 2010 in Florida. I was there. These people were nothing less than American cannibals. This story of one cannibal initiating a victim in the pot to become a cannibal himself is frightening and tragic tale that is correct in every detail.
How did we become to be this way? I have no answers. Michael Shannon is superb as the head cannibal, and is supported by an earnest, if not overly-talented cast. The production values are minimal, but none of these things matter. It is the story and the images and the dialogue that sticks in our mind. The play's the thing. It is a film you will not soon forget."

Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) is a real estate agent who makes his living on foreclosed properties. Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) is an unemployed construction worker who meets Rick Carver under the worse circumstances. He hates Rick Carver as he moves his son (Noah Lomax ) and mom (Laura Dern) out of their family home into a low rent motel filled with displaced families.Through a series of events, Dennis ends up working for Rick Carver, becoming the man he hates, doing a job he hates in economic times that makes a person question integrity. Dennis performs tasks that are outright illegal, jilting Fanny Mae and the taxpayers all in an effort to recover his home.The film is hard hitting as you feel the intensity, for better or worse, of people getting evicted from their homes. The film also questions government polices and bank policies but offers no solutions as the results opens itself up for easy graft.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

Stunning knock out performances by the leads in this movie puts this on my short list of ""best movies nobody's heard of"". If you've ever wondered what all the fuss is about Andrew Garfield this film answers the question. And Shannon delivers another brilliantly seductive and intense performance that is solidifying his place as Hollywood's next generation of great actors. Convincing, complex and initially low key, '99 Homes' is about real people and events which often means heavy doses of irony and over moralizing. However, the slower pacing and deliberate and nuanced development in the characters avoids the usual tropes and makes for a sharp, thoughtful and fulfilling exploration of human nature."

For the most part, I enjoyed what I saw. Although ""Dennis"" becomes the person evicting people out of their homes, there is always a backstory as to how it got to be that way. I'm sure some of the homeowners got the short end of the stick, but I also believe that some of them had it coming. What I didn't understand was why Dennis was afraid of people knowing he evicted others like him. He was already living amongst them--wouldn't't they understand? He's just trying to make it like the rest. This movie felt very ""American"" to me, for lack of a better term--a guy trying to provide for his family. I didn't like the ending. I think he should have turned the paper in; I don't understand why he felt so strongly for this man and his family. I get that he can relate because he has his own son, but he's giving up hope for his own family by doing so. Would have liked to have seen a story with a different, less typical outcome."
" A Powerful Drama About People With Financial Troubles.
",-0.0516,-0.9378,2017-06-03 00:00:00,8,"The Trivia says this movie is based on a true story, it is heartbreaking that greedy people would exploit people who have financial troubles.The performances are very emotional and natural, the pacing is perfect, 99 Homes story line doesn't really go anywhere but it is still interesting to watch and has you wondering what ""Nash"" (Andrew Garfield) is going to do next. We find out a lot later on in the movie that him working for that corrupt so-called businessman ""Carver"" (Michael Shannon) was all done in vain due to ""Nash's"" mother and son walking out on him and not being interested in the new flashy house that ""Nash"" brought them.The film tries to get viewers to have sympathy for ""Nash"" and up to a point we should sympathise with him, but the sympathy should stop as soon as ""Nash"" starts working for ""Carver"" and on top of that ""Nash"" lies to his mother ""Lynn"" (Laura Dern) and she has to find out what he's doing via a massive shouting match between ""Nash"" and another guy that ""Nash"" evicted.It is good that the corrupt businessman got exposed, but all that ""Nash"" had to do was go back to court and see the judge as soon as possible with his lawyer and once they find out that the judge did not sign the papers of them having to vacate their home that soon, then the corrupt businessman would have been exposed, in the film he got exposed when someone nearly got shot, all that heartache and anger could have been prevented had one of the many victims of ""Carver"" followed up the issue with their lawyer and saw a judge.99 Homes is worth watching, once at least, there's no glamour (except for a flashy party scene) it's all very down to earth.We see that ""Nash"" is trying at first to find honest work and he just can't find any, well that is still no excuse to go into the world of corruption and thievery. We see that ""Nash"" doesn't feel right about working for ""Carver"" at times, but he ignores his conscience. Bottom line he should have listened to his conscience, him getting in deeper working for ""Carver"" resulted in ""Nash"" losing his mother and son (possible temporarily) and ending up in jail.""Nash"" had other choices, he could have temporarily gone on welfare (due to him being a single father) while still looking for work and if he'd have gone to see his lawyer they would have got their house back.They also had the other option of staying with the mother's brother in Florida or wherever it was, but ""Nash"" didn't want to uproot the child. They had plenty of options to do the right thing, but ""Nash"" did the wrong thing while withholding important information from his family. Also getting money quick brings greed out in some people and ""Nash"" ends up becoming just like ""Carver"", they both have to look over their shoulders everyday as well as kicking people out of their homes unjustly. One of the most emotional scenes is when ""Nash"" kindly tells a family to move their belongs to the kerb (kicking them to the kerb, it doesn't get anymore humiliating than that.)It all started from debt, we find out ""Nash"" borrowed money from the bank to buy expensive tools so he could work, hence him paying the bank back every month, hence missing payments on the rent/or mortgage. Getting into debt is never a good idea, ""Nash"" could have rented tools until he could afford to buy them without getting into debt, it doesn't seem that his mother's job brought in a lot of money either.We see ""Nash"" make one bad choice after another. Watching this movie will hopefully have you being grateful that you have a home and no financial troubles."
" Really Engaging
",0.4005,0.9712,2017-05-17 00:00:00,8,"I thought the movie was put together really well, and the one thing you want a movie to do is keep you interested, and it does that all the way through.The down side, the last shot of the film was weak. The whole last scene was a little bit of a let down actually. Honestly, I didn't hate Karver the entire movie until he tried to get the paperwork changed. And to think a deal that big would be a bust because of one home is not realistic. There's a lot of unrealistic stuff, but it's a movie so it doesn't really matter.Casting Andrew Garfield as a day laborer, is pretty silly. He didn't even have a tan and stood among the other actors who really fit the profile.Overall I think it's a great movie to watch once and I would recommend it."
" Too far from fact. More fantasy than drama.
",0.0,-0.9244,2017-05-13 00:00:00,4,"There are just too many factual errors. The sheriffs in Florida do not have uniforms like the ones shown. A concealed carry permit is issued by the state after application, not like what was shown in the movie. People who were being foreclosed on had a lot of time to live in their homes. Many did it for years after they stopped paying. Only extremely foolish people could have been caught in the predicament shown here. And as for Nash's final come to Jesus moment, it was too late. After shooting at the police, that guy was facing mandatory prison time. He'd lose the house anyway because prison pay won't take care of the mortgage. And after Nash started making money, he'd have been able to move out of the motel. I was not able to suspend reality to the extent needed to really enjoy this film. It was more of a fantasy than a drama. They may as well have included a snow storm in Orlando."

I'm ALREADY against the guy because a) he couldn't pay off his mortgage, meaning myself has to pay for this guy via my tax dollars and b) he has a kid, which in his financial means he has ZERO business doing.So he lives with his Mom and kid. Whatever. They get evicted, Andrew Garfield's character ends up working for the guy, who is not so straight as he seems. I personally love this. America was founded on a cut throat mentality. Sure this is illegal and not as straight as 'The Founder' but whatever.So the whole thing ends with him selling his old house (that they got evicted from) and buying a new one with a pool, BBall court, and a giant huge area. His Mom starts freaking out about how she wants the original house and the KID SIDES WITH THE F'ING MOM!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Look I and many friends got moved out of our house when we were 8. If I got a stupid pool, BBALL court, and GIANT house overlooking a lake I'd tell my grandmother to F off, and my grandmothers (both of them) weren't stupid enough to whine and B about some stupid trivial house that some dead guy built.Whole film started out interesting, but I literally closed the movie the last 10 minutes and felt I'd been raped. What a pathetic film. 6/10 for the start... -2 out of 10 for the ending, giving this a 2. Save your time."
" Extreme examples for drama
",0.0,-0.9663,2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"There is no doubt that all of these things happened but doubtful they happened in a single instance. The story takes the worst examples of the family, the courts, the police, and others and assembles them into one case.It is apparent to me that the family was in very poor financial condition before the housing market crashed. They ignored the reality of their situation, held out too long, and complained when all of this stuff ""happened to them"".Outside of the unreality of the story it was well done."
" A movie about an important topic in society explored in a great way
",0.7096,0.9958,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"""99 Homes"" deals with an important topic and situations that could happen to every one of us. It is not not only about evictions and the real estate market but also about the ways those decisions effect the people's lives. Michael Shannon delivers a great performance. He perfectly portrays the heartlessness and the greed that his character has. He acts so well that he makes us hate him again, like he did in many other movies already, which is of course a sign of his outstanding acting skills. Andrew Garfield, here giving his second best performance right after ""Hacksaw Ridge"", just draws the viewer in and even though his character becomes more ruthless and cunning throughout the movie we never stop rooting for him. The direction is brilliant and really focuses more on the establishing of the movies characters than the story. This lets the viewer get a better inside into the characters' minds and makes the movie more intense and suspenseful. The cinematography also adds a very big part to the suspense of the movie. Some great aerial shots and many close ups show us the faces of so many characters where we can read all the emotions and feelings without needing many words. That is exactly what the movie thrives of and what makes it so unique and special. The score perfectly underlines all the situations and always plays in the right moments. In conclusion we can say that this movie explore a topic that is very important for society and that shows all the dangers of owing a loan to the bank. All the elements go very well together and the topic is portrayed in a very entertaining way."
" Sincerity and the ugly truth are a bit hindered by an awkward script, but the acting puts it ahead...
",-0.2023,-0.4644,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"99 Homes (2014)Central Florida as a hotspot for real estate scams, of course! With house prices soaring and then diving, there are those scum who profit from other people's loss, taking advantage of both their vulnerability and the government's loopholes.Michael Shannon as Rick Carver is wonderfully cast. A more intense ""bad guy"" would have been a caricature, and someone less bad would have left the movie flat. Shannon plays it down the middle, quick and no nonsense. It's business to him, after all, with only a slight bending of the rules that turns into not so slight paybacks.Andrew Garfield is a reasonable second man, and actually the main character. He gets swept into the scheme because, at first, he is the victim of one and needs to keep his family afloat. It's all too believable. The writing is stiff sometimes, and there are some small turns in the plot that are either confusing to the uninitiated or are just a bit off what you might think is likely. So hold your breath and keep going. The end is not a surprise (sadly), since the foreshadowing is obvious, but it still makes it round up with a bang. Mostly it's enjoyable for putting you there. And feeling the anxiety."
" A Well-Acted Battle of Morality
",-0.3818,0.9869,2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"99 Homes follows a man who, after being evicted from his family home, ends up working with the man who evicted him to gain enough money to buy back his house. Whenever I hear people talk about Andrew Garfield's or Michael Shannon's greatest performances they fail to mention this movie, and it makes me wonder if they never saw it. Both leading actors are absolutely fantastic. These are easily some of these guys' best work. The rest of the acting is good, even from the children, but their roles are thankfully minor. The story itself is an interesting one. It's not often that somewhat mainstream movies about eviction get made, especially not ones about the guys who evict people. That was something I loved about this movie: it focuses on and humanizes these guys. Normally we would perceive people in this line of work as horrible people without compassion, but the reality is that it's a job that somebody has to do, whether you like it or not. It's shown to be a hard job that pays very well, and it makes the audience look at people in emotionally trying jobs like this in a different light. On top of that, the movie itself is very emotionally effective. The characters are people who have lost something dear to them, but it shows how the breadwinner of the family takes steps that he normally wouldn't for things he wouldn't do under normal circumstances. It portrays temptation on his part, something that everyone experiences. It becomes a moral battle for the main character, and I found myself flip-flopping between my own moral standing on the subject. When a movie manages to make the audience think and relate to the characters, I think at that point it has succeeded. If I have but one problem with the movie, it's the ending. Not the ending as a whole, but more the last shot. It wasn't great, and I wish there had been a bit more. Still, it was a pretty good place to end it off, so I can't complain too muchOverall 99 Homes is a really solid movie. The characters and acting are great, the story is engaging, and the subject matter makes the audience think about their own beliefs. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
" If it's not everything the 1st half promises, it's still powerful and disturbing.
",0.2732,0.1505,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"The first half of this soul shaking melodrama about the horrors of the housing market in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown is a devastating half a film. The long sequence where amoral, greedy but smart and coldly logical Michael Shannon oversees the forced eviction of Andrew Garfield and family from their long-time home that he plans to take and then flip is as chilling, cruel and hard to watch as anything in a torture porn film this year. And the very talented Ramin Bahrani even manages to make a slightly long-shot end of first act twist in the main character's behavior make sense.But the second half, while still well acted and intelligent, can't keep up with the power of the foundation that's been laid. The film starts to rely on coincidences and forced structure, and Shannon's villain starts to feel a bit too calculated and Snidely Whiplash – both too all- knowing and all powerful, and yet too dumb at the same time. After creating a topsy turvey world where it seems like anything might happen, we start to get a little ahead of the story, and can guess where the twists, betrayals and moral conundrums will be.But all that said, this is still a strong and important film. Mainstream movies that attempt to confront political and moral issues head-on are rare and valuable commodities, and if this isn't the home-run it seems destined to b at first, it's still a strong double off the back wall. Well worth seeing."
" Property crash drama
",-0.4019,-0.072,2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"If it was not for the to me disappointing ending I would have give it an eight stars rating. But it deserves at least a seven because the acting of Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon are really good. The story itself is a drama that many Americans will recognize. Their properties being foreclosed because of to high unpaid credits is the harsh reality a lot of people had to go through. Who's fault is it? It's a bit everybody's fault. The owners because you try to live above your wealth and by buying everything on credit. It's a typical thing from the USA if you ask me. I'm married to an American and every time I go over there I'm amazed by what the people buy on credit all the time. I live in Belgium and I never buy anything on credit. If I can't afford it cash I just don't buy it. The banks because they would give loans to anybody. The real estates, the government, the judges, all have their fault in this crisis. The movie shows the world of greedy people without any morals, the world of one way justice and the whole corrupt system. It's not a joyful movie but it's worth watching. I'm just a bit disappointed by the ending."
" Great acting but too convenient storytelling
",0.3716,-0.0572,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"'99 Homes' is directed and co-written by Ramin Bahrani, who so far mainly made low-budget indie movies with a relatively unknown cast. These movies never got into the mainstream spotlight, despite overall good reviews. This time, with Hollywood stars Michael Shannon, Andrew Garfield and Laura Dern added to the cast, Bahrani finally received his well-deserved attention. The movie even got a Golden Globe nomination for Michael Shannon's terrific performance.The story follows Andrew Garfield's character, Dennis Nash, who lives together with his mother (Laura Dern) and son (Noah Lomax) outside of Orlando. The movie takes place in 2010, in the aftermath of the mortgage and international financial crisis. Dennis works as a roofer but jobs are scarce and he fails at paying off his loans. This results in realtor Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) knocking at the Nash family's door, evicting them from their family home. Both Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield steal the show in this one. Garfield is a British actor but is very credible in delivering an Orlando accent. He gives his character certain mimics and tics that make him feel real and credible as an uneducated roof worker. Michael Shannon shines at being an asshole, he's an unlikeable asshole realtor but somehow, I found myself rooting for him at times. Shannon seems to be in control of every muscle he uses to express himself and gives one of his best performances. The American housing crisis affected lots of families, which is shown in the movie. The tragedy these evicted families went through is depicted realistically with focus on the emotional toll this sudden change of environment had on the people. Thankfully, this drama was not captured for the sake of the drama, as you often see in Hollywood movies. The best part of the movie was the contrast of these poor families with the predator Rick Carver. He feeds off the situation in morally and legally questionable ways, but isn't a two-dimensional antagonist. He explains why he does what he does and even though you might still not agree with him, at least you understand his motivation. He's not just an asshole for the fun of it or to make the protagonist's life more difficult. The screenplay of '99 Homes' unfortunately stops this movie from being great. The start is promising, after his eviction, Dennis Nash desperately wants his home back and basically sells his soul to the devil when he starts working for the realtor who kicked him out of his own home. But after this, every beat of the movie became predictable. The story did exactly what you'd think it would do and forgot to surprise. It more or less surprised me once however at the end of the second act, but only because it contradicted the ultimate desire of the protagonist. I thought this particular choice in the story was a cheap way of making some drama. The ending, the final climax was again predictable and unsatisfying.'99 Homes' is still a good movie, with great acting and an intriguing plot. The drama depicted in this movie is handled with care and respect to those who have lost their homes. Unfortunately, the screenplay was a little too easy, too convenient and therefore predictable. It never surprised in a good way."
