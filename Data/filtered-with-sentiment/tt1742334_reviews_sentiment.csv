" Some Good, Some Not So Good
",0.7003,0.5647,2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"Some good old action and a bunch of tough 'n' rough characters - Sabotage got some real good stuff going on, the only weak point in my opinion is the script: we get some lenghts and unnecessary scenes that slow down the movie/story too much for my taste. Anyway, Arnie proofed once again that he still can do some action. Solid piece but no masterpiece."
" Cr@potage
",0.0,0.7056,2021-03-17 00:00:00,2,"Are there a lot of 67-year-old DEA agents running around shooting up drug houses? Then there's Terence Howard, the most beta agent in the history of the DEA. And finally The Joker, or whatever that purple-haired ''female"" agent was supposed to be. Good lord she's hideous.The dirty cops thing was done to perfection in The Shield. Why keep reviving it in movie format without having anything fresh to say? The documentary-style film stock doesn't fool anyone.Frankly, after the initial interrogation by internal affairs, I was hoping the cartel would kill them all. I didn't care in which order they got picked off.I still can't believe that after all he accomplished in movies and politics that Arnold went back to churning out violence p3rn. Does he need the money? Because I would have thought that a good publicist could get him on a speaing tour where adoring fans would sell a kidney to go hear him give a rah-rah speech and stand for a few photo-ops. In his spare time he could start a charity that rescues dogs from abusive owners."
" Arnie's doom-laden mania for retribution provides some remarkably vivid imagery!
",0.0,-0.6221,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"A far higher budgeted, gorily Gung Ho, Seagal-style actioner with an immaculately grizzled Arnie playing one of his most audaciously ambivalent characters as 'Breacher', the battle-weary, cigar-chomping head of a riotously rambunctious, trash-mouthed DEA task force, an extremely fractious, volatile crew of hedonistic head-knockers whose frequent lapses of judgment and cavalier attitude to 'law enforcement' finally puts the hateful seven dead-bang in the unwavering firing line of their suspicious superiors and, worse, a gruesomely efficient South American death squad.
'Sabotage' is a remarkably brutal, nihilistic action movie that is raised above the mire of over familiarity by having one of the more forceful, full-blooded and morally dubious character's Arnold Schwarzenegger has played thus far, a well made, tough movie frequently let down with a rather prosaic, unrefined screenplay, yet the oppressively bleak tone and exquisitely grisly, luridly gut-spilling deaths have a deliciously exploitative quality, making David Ayer's enjoyably twisted 'Sabotage' one of the more thrilling, darkly disturbing Hollywood misfires in recent memory. I enjoyed this far more the second time out, as Arnie's renegade 'Breacher' has tangibly old school, blood n' guts gravitas, and his doom-laden mania for retribution provides some remarkably vivid imagery!"
" Love Arnie as usual he was brilliant
",0.8402,-0.468,2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,A semi generic shoot em up film with a little twist. The girl on drugs was Uber annoying. But a satisfying ending for the bad guys.
" Great hopes for this but...
",0.7845,0.624,2021-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Just appeared on Netflix and intrigued because of its star and support cast. Also we were revisiting the original Killing scandinoir, one of the players here is from the US Killing, playing ""Lizzy"". Is it me or is there a production line out there somewhere turning out diminutive actresses for gritty cop etc roles? Lund is lacking in build, Linden much the same, Friel aka Marcella is the UK equivalent who would fit in quite well with the other little actors who seem prevalent in cop shows and sitcoms... am thinking of David Jason in Frost etc and those in Corrie who seem like some Mancunian relations of the Hobbits. Oh yes, once upon a time, Gandalf put in an appearance..."

",0.0,-0.4927,2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Has the potential to have been a really good film, story and cast look solid but the writing let's it down badly. Somehow the film lacks any real tension, Arnie looks too old and Worthington/Howard are reduced to stereotypical roles and seem completely bland and out of place whilst the more unknown actors do a much better job. By the end not a lot makes sense. So sad to see Arnie ending up in junk like this when he could have carried this movie 15 years ago."

Monster, etc. while Arnie was never loved for his acting abilities, this movie exposes just how bad he is. Don't get me wrong I love Arnie, but in this he is terrible, sorry Arnie. As for the rest of his 'team' who seem to be bloodthirsty drug and alcohol fueled thugs. You can't identify with any of them and end up cheering when they get killed off. Every American soldier/warrior/brothers in arms cliche is here. Grotesque unnecessary violence abounds, I made it to what I thought was the end before I turned it off out of shear boredom only to realize there 48 minutes of this drivel to go! I should have realized how crap this was going to be as soon as I saw the brand new box fresh airsoft weapons that the entire cast used. Arnie please don't end your career with this muck, you're better than this!"
" Pretty decent.
",0.4939,0.9395,2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I think this is a pretty solid movie. If you just want an action movie, look elsewhere. Sure, there is a lot of action (but not like The Expendables or some kind of redundant formulaic crap like that) but it is a twister plot which makes for good suspense. A bit fanciful, in terms of the characters (or even the whole DEA dept. in the movie that Arnie heads up) but it all works and ties together. Kind of like across between the movie L.A. Confidential and Sicario but with a lot of whimsy thrown in. Schwarzenegger's role shows his range of acting abilities since he plays a bit of an anti-hero, a rare thing for him. Good casting. All in all, a good movie. If I am in the right mood, I'd give it 7 1/2 stars but I didnt' want to go all in at 8 stars for my review of this."

" There is one thing that this ""film"" did manage to sabotage; 109 minutes of my time!
",-0.5707,-0.9966,2020-12-26 00:00:00,2,"""Sabotage"" (2014), following two great movies after a ten year hiatus, Arnold Schwarzenegger has dove right into rock bottom with this ""movie"". Both films, ""The Last Stand"" (2013) and ""Escape Plan"" (2013) were two great movies! Then, we take a nose-dive plunge into ""Sabotage"". This ""film"" has a very convoluted story, average to mediocre acting, boring and dull sets/locations and a very lazy predictable soundtrack. As far as the storyline goes in this ""movie"", it's one of the most lazily written I've ever seen in any action film. Funny thing is, the trailers show the only interesting parts of this ""film"". Once again, we are lied to by a movie trailer. Seriously, that's really starting to aggravate me! Okay, Film Making 101: movie trailers are supposed to excite an audience and get them interested in seeing the advertised film without spoiling anything. That being said, if you were to compile all of the good parts, which are few and far between, into one clip, then it would be roughly two to four minutes in length, honestly. The rest of this ""film"" just drags on and is so unbearably boring! Plus, the violence in this ""movie"" is way too grueling and redundant. Another film that suffers that problem is the pile of filth, known as ""Casino"" (1995). Usually, I don't mind action scenes and violence in films at all. The more, the merrier! I very rarely complain about violence in movies and TV shows. So, you know if I do, it's an real issue in whatever film I'm reviewing. Violence and fight scenes have to be warranted. Otherwise, the plot will just amount to nothing. That's another sign of a lazy writer, when they think that constant fight scenes tell a story. Yes, action and violence are two great elements. But, you still need one crucial element, a plot. Now, the ""movie"" may be only 109 minutes, but it felt like I was watching it for weeks. That's pretty bad! It's just a poorly executed story with an onslaught of boring action scenes and unnecessary violence. Then for the rest of the running time, nothing happens. As for the acting, it's just as bad as the plot, as you can most likely imagine. When I first saw the cast list, I was very excited. Aside from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the cast included: Sam Worthington, Olivia Williams, Terrence Howard, etc. It was a pretty decent cast! I thought: ""all right, as long as the storyline is solid, then this should be a great movie."" No, all of the actors and actresses look just as confused as the script and waddle around like morons until the ""film"" is over. The only ones who appear to be trying are, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sam Worthington, Terrence Howard and Olivia Williams. Sadly, the bad script marred their performances and prevented them, along with the rest of the cast from shining. All of the sets/locations are dull and create a boring atmosphere. Some of the locations were cool, but poorly lit sets and murky cinematography just accentuated the boredom and made it all the more ugly to watch. Finally, the soundtrack is nothing but your everyday predictable and cliched action film score. Granted, some of the songs were okay. But overall, it was nothing worth writing home about. The only good element in this pile of filth is the special effects. They are well-done and still hold up to this day. Being made in 2014, that's no surprise. Unfortunately, special effects are no excuse for poor writing, bad acting, dull sets/locations and a lazy soundtrack. ""Sabotage"" is definitely one of the most disappointing action films I've ever seen. It's so bad, that I actually almost considered putting it on my top 10 worst action films list! However, it didn't get ranked there, because surprisingly, I've seen worse. But, not that much worse! This is one of those movies where I watched it, nothing happened, who cares? That's exactly how I felt when I was subjected to watching this diarrhea stain. I'm struggling to rate this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to say, skip this ""movie""? All it will do is sabotage 109 minutes of your time."
" A BIG MESS
",-0.3612,-0.9971,2020-12-23 00:00:00,1,"Schwarzenegger the king of Action does give a fairly good performance as a different kind of character but he's more an Ass-hole type & every other character in the movie is horrible!!!! Arnie's rough team of Agents are vile, nasty & totally unlikeable, they go about speaking trash & are just a bunch of horrible people who you hate & want to die so that right there is wrong & a huge mistake that bugs the hell outta me is at the beginning the rough team storm a drug Lords mansion & kill everyone & hide a huge amount of money but burn the rest & after this the team go through months of interrogation where the interrogators keep asking about the money & an exact amount? But how? How would they know they hid anything if it all got burned up? & how on earth would they know how much is missing from the burned up money?????? Makes no sense at all, stupid crappy vile film"
" Not sure what's holding this together.
",-0.2411,-0.8922,2020-11-30 00:00:00,5,"Did not mind the story, but the violence is too much. This is hyper-violent, crazy stuff. The story is also hyper-surreal. It borders on the unrealistic, though it feels like it's meant to be believable. A mad jumbo truck ride over a lot of messed up cars.
Try it if you like mayhem, guts and gore."
" Good story, realistic action.....but safe ending.
",0.7003,0.9576,2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Good to see Arnie back.
Darker and bloodied than previously and Ayer direction is always gritty and authentic.After seeing the deleted scenes and alternate ending it was a real shame that they decided to go for the happier ending as the other was more original and effective.
It would have been better imo to see Arnie in a different light and be a darker character. But instead they went for the safe option.
At least the alternate version is on the blu ray to see.Also the dropped missing girl sub plot looked good too, shame that was edited out.
Well worth a watch if like a good who dunnit."

" Believe the IMDb Score
",0.0,-0.8092,2020-08-13 00:00:00,5,"David Ayer has made some of my favorite cop-action dramas, so I thought that I would check this out in spite of the poor reviews. You can believe the low IMDb rating for this film, and it's even a bit generous. This movie is such a mess that even the title makes zero sense. Unless you're a looking at this film with Schwarzenegger-tinted glasses, it just doesn't add up to a story that can hold water.I should have just turned it off when the movie started to get stupid, which was right after the robbery. I was genuinely curious as to how the story would evolve. It didn't evolve, the story putrefied at every turn. There can't be enough preposterous gun battles to rescue the even more preposterous plot.As a student of language, I would never mock someone's accent. With that said, the director should have his star work with a diction coach to iron out his problematic r endings.""Stop right there.""
Arnold says, ""Stop rait day-ah.""I noticed that this only really stands out when he ends a sentence with this r sound, so maybe they could have just written this accent weakness out of the script. A small thing, but Arnold's accent has improved greatly since the days when that was sort of his trademark, but you have to ask why an American DEA agent would have an Austrian accent.And Arnold is way too old for this part, I don't care how good he looks for his age. Mid 60s and a field agent?"
" Darker Arnold
",0.0,-0.7684,2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,"In comparison to AS' other movies, this lacks the usual humour and is a much darker and violent movie. Action flicks can be all very similar and this follows the themes of revenge and betrayal. The rest of the cast are familiar from the genre, the scenes together sometimes a bit much but again this is the genre. I have no complaints about the movie. It's pretty violent and a lots of gory murders. Olivia Williams gives a great naturalistic performance and the DEA group are all from the dependable basket - I always like Josh Holloway. A bit different for AS but worth watching."

They are so over the top its not even funny. Over-acting all the way, all but Arne actually. Fun to see him in a dark role."
" Not Arnies best movie, definitely needs more but definitely is very good
",0.8179,0.9865,2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Sabotage is about a DEA Task Force who find themselves getting killed one by one after they rob a drug cartel safe house. As the body count rises everyone is a suspect and the Leader of the DEA Task Force John 'Breacher' Wharton (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to seek revenge for the people who killed his wife and son. The film is an action packed film and has great acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sam Worthington, Joe Manganiello, Josh Holloway, Terence Howard, Max Martini, Kevin Vance, Mireille Enos and Olivia Williams. Sabotage is a very good film but there are things that stop it from being an excellent film. The film needs more, there weren't enough fight scenes, some scenes should have been different which would have made the film better etc but it wasn't a weak or crap film. The film is not an in between very good and excellent film nor is it an excellent film, but it is a very good film and I did enjoy watching it."

",0.0,-0.8489,2020-05-04 00:00:00,1,"Not quite the worst film I've ever seen in over half a century, but pretty damn close!
Reasons by list;
Acting - so bad it makes Neighbours look like The Globe.
Directing - none.
Lighting inept.
Machismo - makes The Expendables look realistic.
Characterisation - wear black and swear non-stop.
Gore - hopelessly gratuitous, a lot involving innocent third parties.
Arnie - career worst - honestly!
Plot - write it yourself after 2 mins.
Star Wars reference - All our ""heroes"" are look - all the heavily armed villains are stormtroopers.

All seems to go off relatively seamlessly until the stolen cash goes missing and then members of the team begin turning up dead one by one.Its very violent, lots of murder. Very boys club set up, lots of jocularity from the elite DEA team, lots of recognizable faces within the team (Joe Manganiello, Josh Holloway, Mireille Enos, Terrence Howard) some not so much, it took me a while to pick out Sam Worthington. Impressed with Mirelle Enos as the lone girl in the unit, she kicks ass, keeps up with the boys, is slightly crazy, a great character.It's a cool story idea, bit different for Arnold Schwarzenegger, along the lines of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, keeps you guessing throughout whodunit.

The cast offer brilliant performances and Schwarzenegger has lost none of his skills as an action hero and turns in a multi layered performance as Breacher. This film undeservedly disappeared upon release but it's well worth watching and despite the mystery being solved by the end of the film, there is enough action and chemistry between the cast to give this definite rewatch value."
" Don't let your kids watch this, it is really dark.
",0.0,-0.2023,2018-06-09 00:00:00,6,The movie is a dark one for one with Arnold in it. The story is allright. The combination of a police investigation and the team isn't worked out too well and feels a bit problematic.
" So many bad oneliners!
",-0.6212,-0.4826,2018-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Arnold is still super fit, but MAN the amount of bad onliners!! It just doesnt stop... Not to speak of all the cliche's."
" Afternoon filler at best
",0.6369,-0.9398,2018-05-09 00:00:00,5,"What can you say about an aged Arnold and incredibly difficult cast to actually like. The film in itself as a story and plot is sizably decent. The fact that a group of undercover DEA agents would rob a cartel is plausible. Also plausible that said cartel would find out and seek retribution. There are a lot of action scenes that go over well but in the style of the 80/90's era. Really the whole film wrapped around greed, grief, revenge. I was not overtaken by any characters at all, but this film is sure to fill a lazy afternoon."
" A film worth watching if you have no high expectations
",-0.0772,0.8538,2018-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Summary: What was going through the directors mind when he thought this is what Hollywood needed?Sabotage might best be summed up as a Schwarzenegger classic highlighting all the nuances that only Schwarzenegger film can. Corny, daft and borderline buffoonery are all adapt words for this profiterole of nonsense.The movie poster too is fine illustration of just how absurd the movie actually is; displaying a movie that probably best belongs in the 80's.If you watch the film with low expectations then it's actually pretty good and that's down to the whodunit style plot the premise of the film sits on, a premise that remains until its climatic reveal toward the end.The film also benefits from the brutality one rarely sees in a Schwarzenegger film, it's unexpected and brings a sense of foreboding and realism to the story.Unfortunately, the pinnacle that ruins any willingness in trying to accept the movie is the ridiculous car chase at the end. From that moment on, the viewer is left finishing the film simply because it's only a few minutes awayDirected by David Ayer, one must wonder what was going through his mind when he thought this is what Hollywood needed...So with all said and done, it's a daft movie that isn't dreadful but simply okay."
" Arnie well past his best
",0.743,0.9159,2018-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Fairly simple plot about revenge and a drug bust gone wrong. Not that it really matters, this is a movie that delivers on action and violence. And it's pretty strong on the latter. A lot of unconvincing CGI blood flying around, but at the same time much of the gore is pretty realistic looking too. And we get the usual Arnie somehow surviving despite have rounds of serious ammo aimed at him. As for the big man himself he's one of my heroes, with the likes of The Terminator & Predator being some of my favourite movies. But sadly he just looks too old here to be doing this sort of thing now. Come on Arnie, time to hang up those weapons! Pretty forgettable film, perhaps worth watching just the once."
" Not Arnold's best but a somewhat decent action movie.
",-0.2924,0.5849,2018-01-22 00:00:00,4,"Arnold is really cool in this film even though it's not his best work.Arnold plays John Wharton aka ""Breacher"" leader on the DEA
swat team. On their latest bust his team find a large crate size
of money and they agree to steal it ( at least a small amount).In this film Arnold doesn't play a good cop or at least not
a squeaky clean one. It's been awhile since I've seen this,
I can only remember seeing this at least maybe four times
and that I think was three years ago so I'm a little fuzzy on
details. The movie is basically a whodunit because himself
and his team are targeted and being killed one by one by an
anonymous killer and their stolen drug money is missing.Director David Ayer is the co-writer with Skip Woods they both
made I feel an alright little action-mystery thriller here, but having 
said that this movie does have is flaws which I'll get into some here.The dialog is not really good, or at least in parts, but on the whole it's
OK. The characters could have been written a little better as in the
team mates, I don't know, I felt something was missing because you
don't feel really close to them. As for the Arnold's character, at least
you cared for the most, his dialog wasn't great either but OK in parts.
On to the murders, the after views of team mates killed are fairly horrific
and quite gory too so if your squeamish you have been warned, but it's
really not that bad because those scenes are briefly shown and their aren't
that many.On to the good stuff, the action scenes are awesome and very exciting,
there is a car chase scene where Arnold is in the back of a truck firing at
a car with the shooter in the open trunk firing back that scene was awesome.
And they're cool shoot outs plus an awesome kick ass ending that is very
satisfying which I love.Overall not a great movie but I think it's one of those sort of fun tough guy
action movies that is in my opinion a bare bones no BS type that can be
enjoyed once and awhile.I give this a 4/10. If your an Arnold fan or even an action fan I think
you can enjoy this, give it a look."
" Excess
",0.0,-0.9841,2018-01-13 00:00:00,6,"After a raid on a cartel safehouse, members of an elite DEA task force find themselves being picked off one at a time.It's so much stupider than that, but I want you to find out for yourself if you choose to watch this. This is the only thing Ayer has directed that I don't love. Yes, even with all the issues Suicide Squad has. And I can't hate this. What works is actually really good. Still, ultimately, this is done in by its very foundation. The concept is based on something so dumb, there are three different entries for it in the Goofs section. Two people read what others had written about it already, and still felt the need to explain how baffling it is in their own words. And I applaud them for it.That's not all. The ""locker room"" talk that is applied perfectly in Street Kings is here overpowering. Characters are obnoxious to the point of it becoming white noise, which drowns out even all their definition, development and the, sometimes out-there, things that happen to them. Arnie and others act their hearts out. The tone is simply mean-spirited. Sadism, blood and gore is lingered on where before this director limited it, made it disturbing not celebrated, to much greater effect. The action is too spread out, and once you get past the opening set-piece, it never gets that big again. Most of the slasher murder mystery is boring. The resolution is absurd and unsatisfying, both what ended up in the film and the Trivia's original versions.There's a ton of swearing and sex for its own sake(frequently immediately followed by violence, or soured by other nastiness) in addition to what I've already mentioned. I recommend this solely to those who, like me, take in everything they can of David's work. 6/10"
" It sabotages your time and money
",0.0,0.3291,2017-12-07 00:00:00,3,"I would have never gone to watch it in a theatre if not for Josh Holloway. From whatever I've seen till now, I firmly believe that he has more acting prowess than all the rest of the 9 members of his team combined. But unfortunately, he is a TV star and not a bankable name in movie world. I wish better movies and meatier roles for him. Anyways, as far as the movie is concerned, its a boring movie. Thats all i can say. Had to sit through it 'cause i had paid for it."
" 48 percent body fat
",0.0,0.9932,2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Coming from David Ayer (man responsible for some of the best cop thrills this century like 'Training Day' or 'End of Watch') and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, one could expect some nice action packed gritty thrill ride. Well, 'Sabotage' almost is. It is gritty and action scenes hold up well. And for me, the gruel violence wasn't very disturbing and didn't seem unnecessary or totally out of the place. David Ayer seems to be one of the very few directors who actually gets the hand held camera direction correct. Arnie's acting abilities has improved quite a bit after his stint as governor was over. It was probably his (post political) career best performance and it was really enjoyable to see Schwarzenegger explore his darker side. The rest of the macho cast did good as well - although not much attention didn't seem to go into character development, surprisingly not all the team members were one dimensional and paper thin. To my own astonishment I have to say that acting was the strongest part of this film. Only if the script could have been better. 'Sabotage' wasn't pure action film, it tries to play out as mystery and it kind of is. There is said to have a little suspension of disbelief while watching action films, and there lies the problem - 'Sabotage' takes itself too seriously, and there are not enough over the top action that one starts to follow the story too closely and sees the plot holes big enough to fly Millennium Falcon through them.'Sabotage' had all the ingredients to be at least as good as 'End of Watch' or even be much greater on the scale. Another wasted opportunity. Like Schwarzenegger's character Breacher said - look at you, with your 48 percent body fat."
