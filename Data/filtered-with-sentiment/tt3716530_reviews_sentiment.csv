" BUNCH OF PSYCHOPATHS.
",0.0,-0.9041,2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Live on the edge, die on the edge. A good warning for people who value their lives to practice safe sex. It was a weird French flick with complicated relationships and infidelity everywhere. A rape from the get go, we expect a rape story. Not at all. It is a psychopathic character story. It is not going to be your regular hero's revenge at all! Hilarious at times, dramatic at times, our bunch of psychopaths keeps us guessing."
" The ""rape culture"" that has so indignant feminists since the 1970s, is pitted throughout the film by director Paul Verhoeven.
",-0.8525,-0.8537,2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"The ""rape culture"" that has so indignant feminists since the 1970s, is pitted throughout the film by director Paul Verhoeven (known to most for his forays into sci-fi with titles such as RoboCop and Starship Toopers and in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct) to visually package the content of the novel ""Oh ..."" by Philippe Djian which aroused many controversies already at its publication in 2012. But beyond the sadomasochistic representation of the story, evident from the very first bars, I mean the author literary as the director seems to focus on the ""cynicism"" that surrounds the protagonists of the story. Therefore, according to this reading, more sociological than intimist, the work paradoxically assumes moral value in denouncing ""the indifference of the times"". Michèle behaves so it is for the traumatic childhood experiences but above all because she is a ""daughter of the times"" and her ""cynicism"" towards others but above all to herself is the only way out for r not succumb. In this, Huppert's acting professionalism is extraordinary, capable of giving life with her corporeality to a disturbed and disturbing character that had already been seen in ""The Pianist"".
The reassuring and light final scene suggests a ""sisterhood"" that denounces the male uselessness, and in this regard it would be interesting to know the post-vision and / or post-reading reactions of the female audience compared to the male one!"
" Huppert + Verhoeven = A film you may not like, but you WILL watch.
",-0.1419,0.0181,2020-10-29 00:00:00,5,"Poor Elle - to say she comes from a disfunctional family would be an understatment: her father is a mass murderer; her mother is a woman who enjoys life and young men; her son is irresponsible and can't control his life. Her job is interesting - you can say that. The screenplay and direction are by the man who gave us TOTAL RECALL, BASIC INSTINCT, STARSHIP TROOPERS and SHOWGIRLS so you can see, he'll go to any lengths to give the audience a good show. Huppert is not a great actress, but she does come across well in this film. There are some truly comical moments in this film. To say much more, you would start giving the story away. Not what I want to do. The film is French with English subtitles - you might find a dubbed version, but that would ruin the effect."
" Full of threads that go nowhere
",0.0,-0.431,2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,One of worst movies I've seen. Full of threads that billow off the main character but go absolutely nowhere except the bin of horrible implausible scenarios ps I so wanted to punch her son in the face. 2 out of 10 is actually being generous.
" Tried too hard to be subversive
",-0.3182,-0.9266,2020-05-07 00:00:00,3,"I had read a lot of reviews before watching, which may have set my expectations too high. The protagonist is rather flat, and delivers an almost robotic performance. Throughout the film it is hinted that she aided her father in gruesome murders as a young girl, though it is never revealed whether she was involved or not. I felt that the inclusion of this was rather anti-climactic & the film would have truly benefited from a plot twist (e.g. she participated in killing the animals/ children) If this was the case, it would explain much more why her demeanour throughout the film felt very detached and lacked emotion (I refer to her mother's death & her opinions of her sons ""child"")Very unsure of wether Elle, to some degree enjoyed her sexual relationship with her neighbour/rapist. Whilst I understand this film has tried to be transgressive, it does not succeed.The ending was terrible. The fact that she now accepts her son & approves of his girlfriend and they are shown to be a happy family simply because he killed her ""rapist"" was highly implausible. The premise of the storyline had such potential, but sadly failed to deliver."
" A miserable, meandering, misanthropic mess
",-0.6908,-0.9694,2020-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Terrible film. I absolutely do not understand the acclaim. I'm generally one for a good transgressive theme, but that alone does not make a movie worthwhile. Isabelle Huppert puts in a committed performance, and the rest of the cast is competent, but that can't save the meandering story, miserable pacing, or the inconsistent tone of the writing.The movie drags on for way, way, way too long at 130 minutes, especially considering no real tension is ever built, nor do any of the characters really blossom much. Really, you just grow to dislike the characters more and more as you become less and less interested in the story itself, probably due to the fact that nothing of any interest happens throughout the majority of the entire film, other than watching characters slowly accept the far-end of damaging and malicious personality traits as normalcy.On top of everything else, the movie is visually very bland and ugly to look at. It really could have used a TON of cutting. I'm a huge Paul Verhoeven fan but this is the first film I've seen that's part of the post-Hollywood, 3rd wave of his directing career, and I was gravely disappointed. Most legends can't keep things up forever ::shrugs:: go watch Turkish Delight or The 4th Man instead!"
" Paul lost in French Cinema
",-0.3182,-0.961,2020-01-28 00:00:00,1,"The fabulous divine Ms Huppert has absolutely no range. A faint perpetual smirk to accompany her faint freckled colouring is not a vehicle of mystery but just a smirk.
She's actually saying, got you, suckers, you paid good money to see this trashy movie. Except I didn't, I saw it for the upteenth time on late night TV, and was gobsmacked that Verhoeven would put his name on such garbage.
The plot is too ludicrous to be remotely disturbing, and all the worst pseudo-intellectual attributes of French cinema have taken poor Verhoeven hostage. That trying too hard to be in your face attitude just doesn't come off.
What's he trying to be? A French auteur? Yeah, right! It's all so cynically presented, I flatly refused to fall for it.
Unforgivable pretentiousness from the master of sci fi, you want to impress me, Paul? You've already done it. RoboCop has infinite more cinematic nuance than this stuff. Just give it up already."
" Zero for plot. Five stars for everything else.
",0.0,-0.9982,2020-01-26 00:00:00,5,"Wow. I cannot believe the number of awards this film was nominated for. You can call it provocative, avant- garde, , different, etc. But how can these so-called qualities of approach override the utter implausibility of the plot?Woman is raped and assaulted in her home. Woman decides to carry on as if nothing unusual has occurred. Woman finds out identity of the rapist. Woman tells nobody. She then puts herself in situations to be battered and raped again. In some scenes she if struck so violently but shows zero physical or emotional affects. She invites the rapist into her home. She welcomes rapist into social circle of friends and workmates. She informs rapist while driving home with him that she intends reporting all to the police, with not a shred of concern for her own safety! Finally, she is violently attacked again within minutes of having notified rapist of her intention, but miraculously help appears when someone (I am trying to not reveal too much of this absurd plot) strikes the rapist over the head with a fatal blow.Remarkably, I kept watching to the very end of this film for two reasons. The standout performance by Isabelle Huppert and the possibility that the plot could become even sillier.Not recommended for women sensitive to the idea of a rapist being embraced by his victim."
" Most. Pathetic. Film. Ever.
",-0.6115,-0.9442,2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,"1. Women are portrayed as nothing but cheap trash to be abused with no repercussions to their abusers.
2. Police are seen as enemies of the common man with no reasons why this is.
3. The general acting is okay, as is the cinematography, but they all buckle beneath the weight of a completely implausible story, that of women fully accepting the hardships that befall them is their fault.
4. This film lacks a conscience, a responsibility to protect women. How any studio greenlighted this absurdity is beyond me. Not recommended."
" This one is a GOOD movie!
",0.6027,0.9211,2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"THICK PLOTCut the crap! That is the masters way to start a movie. Sex scene as the first shot, was in the last Sydney Lumet's film. In Paul's movie, - it's the second shot.And it's rape! Then the plot gets thicker and thicker with every scene. It's like pretty normal life of adult woman at start, but DAMN is there a lot going on! And it's hard to say if she normal after all. So, you might think that's it's hard to swallow one. But the smooth tone of the movie really helps to get over it painlessly.The cast works well with their characters. And I'm sure the team must be great on such a project. Paul Verhoeven is truly a master."
" Interesting endeavour from the great Paul Verhoeven.
",0.7783,0.9832,2019-10-07 00:00:00,7,"This film is rather controversial, it deals with heavy subject matter that Paul Verhoeven treats provocatively, as only he knows how to. Isabelle Huppert puts on a strong performance; as she completely understood her character, and while it's not a very expressive performance there are specific details, nuances and reactions to certain events that underscore her brilliant portrayal. Let's keep in mind that we are dealing with a woman who doesn't react as emphatically as one would expect, which accentuates a certain strange behaviour, and as the story unfolds, we get to understand her character's tragic life events, and we come to realize why she is broken.As the plot indicates, she becomes entangled in a game of cat and mouse as she is trying to discover the identity of the man who sexually assaulted her. She is a successful woman, who is a head of a video game company. One of the aspects that keeps the plot interesting is that after the attack, she keeps on being harrassed by her abuser in different ways, to the point that she starts to look at several men she knows as potential suspects. Another interesting or rather unconventional particular is the fact that despite her unsettled childhood she became an incredibly sucessful professional but it caused her to respond quite abnormally to such a taxing situation. This completely puts her character in place, and her relationship with those around her.Verhoeven's direction is great, although I wouldn't refer to Elle as one of his best films; this probably falls a bit short in comparison, but it is still a fine effort. I have to mention that the assault scenes are not as crude as others I've seen before. And the tone of the film, chromatically speaking, is on point, very well accomplished in my opinion; that somehow fits perfectly with Michèle's unbalanced facets of her life."
" What the elle
",0.0,0.34,2019-09-21 00:00:00,1,"Grossly unsatisfying; a very flat affair.I expect (or at least hope) that the source novel goes into much more detail about the traumatic events in her childhood, but here all we have is a brief sketch. It was unclear if she gives an honest account of events; I wondered if she was more involved in what happened back then than she admitted to Patrick. All in all, there just wasn't enough exposition."
" Elle (2016)
",0.0,0.1359,2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Paul Verhoeven. Starring Isabelle Huppert, Laurent Lafitte, Jonas Bloquet, Anne Consigny, Charles Berling, Christian Berkel, Virginie Efira, Judith Magre, Alice Isaaz, Lucas Prisor, Arthur Mazet. (R)Divorced mother and businesswoman Huppert, victim of a rape in the opening scene, instigates a psychosexual game with her masked stalker while dealing with a fractured and morally-perilous personal life. Part mid-life crisis exploration, part rape-revenge female empowerment thriller, part corrosive black comedy, it is such a transgressive product of controversial director Paul Verhoeven's identity that one can only assume that the only reason it took so long for him to make it is because it's so fearlessly subversive that he needed to be out of the Hollywood system to get it done (well, that, and because it's based on a novel called ""Oh..."" that didn't get published until earlier in the decade). Huppert is sensational in the lead role, playing a character of such ruthless complications that it's nearly impossible to not detest her on some level while recognizing painful humanity (even relatability) on another. Challenging, to say the least (the roll call is full of so-called deplorables, and one could view it all as feminist anti-heroism just as easily as rationalized misogyny), and flawed around its brittle edges, notably in the way that the climactic ""shock"" rings inauthentic and underwhelming, but the enterprise remains utterly absorbing throughout in its cold, perverse way. Verhoeven's best film in over twenty-five years, but don't expect much resemblance at all to that Schwarzenegger picture.84/100"
" A Dutch directed, French movie triumph with excellent performances
",0.7783,0.6705,2019-08-02 00:00:00,8,"After reading a short premise and seeing the trailer for the film, I had a little bit of trepidation about what was in store.
Indeed the film begins with a horrific sexual attack on the central character Michèle (Isabelle Huppert). However the following couple of hours has an intense screenplay.What follows is a couple of hours of black comedy elements as Michèle attempts to identify her attacker.
There are many suspects. The film showcases several strange characters and their sidestories.
However the triumph of the film is the performance of Huppert as Michèle. A powerful businesswoman who owns a computer game design company.Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) actually made this film in France. A successful modern example of world cinema that won a Golden Globe and Huppert won an Oscar nomination.Verhoeven does have form for films that explore seedy adult elements (Basic Instinct)."
" Psycho-sexual thriller par excellence
",0.6705,0.9461,2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"While not usually a Verhoeven fan (except for ""Basic Instinct"", which I love), this film was a pyscho-sexual thriller par excellence. It was cool, amoral, unsettling, and so very French. You literally cannot take your eyes off Isabelle Huppert, as she is a magnetic screen presence. Her Best Actress Oscar nomination is well deserved (and overdue), so here's hoping she wins."
" Verhoeven is back, and he has been dearly missed
",0.1531,-0.5719,2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Paul Verhoeven's work is often divisive, technical, and precise. At his best, he defines a genre with satirical flairs and constant energy (Robocop or Starship Troopers). At his worst, you still can't look away from his perfected masterclass of directing chaos (looking at you ShowGirls). With Elle each disturbing step that Verhoeven pushes his audience towards leaves you pale and frightened. It is an unsettling revenge thriller that needs to be seen, with an incredible performance from Isabelle Huppert, and a complimenting precision from Verhoeven behind the camera."

" A study on outrage

This is an adaptation of the Prix Interallié winning novel ""Oh..."" by Philippe Djian. It is a social satire as much as a revenge drama. It has several themes including violence in computer games, sexual empowerment, and lax suburban crime prevention. Isabelle Huppert gave a convincing performance, conveying her character's reactions to the convoluted threads of her life, and and extraordinary and surreal events, which leads to a preposterous motive. An arresting and engaging film."
" Explanation of this bad fairytale.
",-0.628,-0.9999,2019-02-20 00:00:00,1,"There are many misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding this film. I will try to address few of them so that people would have a better understanding of the film.
The plot is very simple, Michèle is a businesswoman who seemingly has a dull life, surrounded by unsuccesfull characters, especially men. One day she got brutally beaten and raped at home but she went on her life as if nothing happened. Many critics and some reviewers here celebrated this as strenght which is untrue. She went on her life seemingly unscathed because of mainly two reasons :1- She is a depraved, deranged, emotionless, selfish psychopath bordering on sociopathy, so she cannot feel anything nor can actually care for anybody. If she were a sane, healthy and normal human being, i'd call it strenght but at her case, this is just a lacking of basic human emotions.2- She enjoyed, actually loved getting brutally beaten and raped. She was moaning, groaning with pain and pleasure and her throes made this obvious.So she just went on her life and she never attempted to go to the police nor to reveal her rapist's identity. She just accepted her beating and rape and moved on. After a short while, she started to receive messages from her rapist which actually made her excited , even aroused. One day after she got home, the rapist attacked and started to brutally, viciously beat her. She fought back hoping he could beat her more viciously and mercilessly. At one point of struggle, she reached out his mask and revealed his identity which happened to be her married neighbour with whom she has been flirting. She got confused and wanted him to get out which he complied.Then she and rapist began a sort of relationship based on S&M and rape. Those supposedly violent rape and beating scenes were quite funny. In the cinema, the majority of male audience laughed loudly. That's because they were extremely unrealistic. For example, he thrown her away and when she's on her four, he kicked right on her face which should cause extreme damage. He then grabbed her head and smashed it against wall repeatedly which also should ansure very serious brain damage. Addititonally, he got punched and slapped her face dpzens of times yet not even a scratch appeared on her face. If you watched Irreversible, by Gaspar Noe, it was pretty much the same beating and Monica Bellucci's character in that film ended up in coma as it should be.Throughout her relationship with her rapist, she was very weak and passive. The rapist did use her as an sex object, as a piece of meat and a punchbag and she complied. Some also call this as if she turned table on her rapist and got upper hand which is wrong. She gave him whatever he wanted and at no point she was in control nor shpwn any sin of consciouss and strenght in the relationship with her rapist. Imagine you go to a school and some bullies beat you to take your money, lunch and force you to do their homework. Then one day you decide that to give them whatever they wanted, money, lunch etc., willingly. Would you call this strenght? Same happens to Michele too. She was just a punchbag and toy so that he could satisfy his sadistic urges upon her body. Surely she liked to get beaten and raped too but she did not initiate anything. She was just passively receiving whatever given her by her rapist.Another big misconception is that people somehow believe she orchestrated, plotted the demise and punishment of her rapist. In reality, she did not. At no point of film she shown any kind of conscious, awareness of her self-destructive and self-loathing behaviours. There is literally no sign within the film that she planned her revenge. Here is how it goes :They thrown a party and everybody was there. She wanted to leave early and asked her rapist to take her home. During the driving, she told him that she was going to go to the police and report his crimes. In reality, she never had such an intention throughout the film. She told this to provoke him so that he could way more brutally beat and rape her. This is all she wanted. She even wanted to get brutally beaten to death. That is because his crimes were extremely henious and, depending on the country, would warrant 15 years in prison which would ruin his life entirely. So the rapist had no other choice but to beat her to death. It's worth to note that Michele was an extremely masochistic woman.After they arrived, she got out of car and entered house but left the gate unlocked so that he could sneak in easily. As usual, she fought back to make him angrier to receive extremely vicious and brutal beating. Then out of nowhere, her son appeared and bludgeoned him to death. As i said earlier, many somehow believe she arranged this whole justice and revenge and that she told her son to be at home. In reality, no she did not do such a thing. The son was supposed to be at the party. That him being at home was pure coincidence. She wanted to get brutally raped and beaten to death but this random event ruined her plans. It's like golden shot drug addicts often apply themselves and usually they end up dead.So what is my evidence that she did not planned this whole revenge but it was random? Here they are :1- There is no sign or evidence to suggest that she planned this. She did not talk to her son at the party about this. Her intention, when she told him she was going to go to the police , was to provoke him so that he could get angrier, reckon how his life could be ruined and decide to beat her to death.2- In the Phillippe Djian's book,which this film based on, it was obvious that she did not plan this nor attempted to get any revenge. All she wanted was to get brutally raped, beaten and eventually murdered at the hands of her sadistic rapist.3- Isabelle Huppert, in her interviews, clearly stated that this was a random event. Her son was not supposed to be at home and it was pure coincidence.4- Similarly, Paul verhoeven also stated that it was a coincidence. He even went further and said "" It was a divine punishment ""You can google for these aforementioned interviews.Many also call the ending happy but i disagree . Sure if we realistically think, a sadistic rapist, who very likely raped ,beaten and perhaps murdered other women too and will continue to do so, was eliminated and justice has served but there is nothing realistic about this film. Even Huppert herself state that this is just a fantasy, just a fairytale. It was an unhappy ending because our heroine did not get what she wanted. Her son's intervention ruined Michele's plans.As for the film itself, The plot is dull, characters are like caricatures and not well developed if any at all. This also includes main character. She was an emotionless, selfish, unlikeable psychopath who just wanted to get beaten and raped and she ended up just like that. She never developed any kind of consciouss or awareness or shown strenght at any point of the film.Many people complain that this is a mispresentation of women and it portrayed women as if they want to get beaten and raped. Counter argument is that she was just a woman, an individual and cannot represent all of the women which is true. The key point here is that it's not about her, it's about the acts of rape and violence against women. The acts of rape and violence against women portrayed as welcomed, wanted, desired and sought out. This also reinforce and strenghten male myth that women secretly want to get raped. The film takes this a step further and add extreme violence beside rape. Films, books have certain influence over people even in subconscious. Anybody who watched this film may get that idea that women may like to get brutally beaten and raped and this idea will stay in subconscious, waiting to be triggered. It may never get triggered perhaps but also it may. It is only a woman depicted in the film that enjoys getting raped and beaten but if such a character does exist, then why there shouldn't be other women like Michele? ALso there are other countless films that depict women just like this. Betty blue and Killer Instinct came to my mind quickly. In UK, every 1 in 6 women get raped and in USA, around 1900 women get raped everyday. The sexual assault and voilence against women is a very serious problem in every society. At the end of the day, we all have mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and female friends. This resonates a question, should actresses, directors, producers have any responsibility for people, society and their well beings or should they do whatever they want? This is a long, deep subject matter which i won't delve right now.Huppert's performance was above par but i somehow have grown up tired of her acting. I watched a bunch of her films and she, less or more, plays pretty much same characters with similar mimics. You would lose nothing if you don't watch this film and you would gain nothing either if you do.This film also made it obvious that why less and less people read critics' reviews because they are very unreliable and misguiding."
" Ummm...No Thank You
",0.3612,-0.9439,2019-02-09 00:00:00,2,"(Flash Review)This is far from what I expected. I did not like the subject matter, nor the approach. I was misled by the teaser blurb I read. If you really think about this film, it is rather disgusting. The film opens with a rape attack just ending and soon after the women appears to have been aroused by it!!! Whaaaat!? This happens again and she appears to be encouraging this.....um....activity. Why on earth is she doing this many will ask. Later we learn her father was responsible for a grizzly mass murder that she sort of was involved with as a young girl. Grim right! I thought this was going to be about a women tracking down and getting vindication against her attacker. The film isn't over the top with what it shows but many of the character's actions and decisions are preposterous and unexpected beyond the demented protagonist. Avoid this one! 2 points for the production quality."

" Spellbinding, steely performance by Hupert; great direction
",0.6249,-0.3807,2018-09-25 00:00:00,9,"This is not an easy film to watch. I believe in the death penalty for some crimes, including rape, so it was not this subject matter that kept me watching ELLE. Rather, it was the direction by Verhoeven, clearly one of his career peaks; the extremely well done action sequences; great photography; and convincing dialogue.Best of all, Isabelle Hupert, in one of the greatest female performances I have ever watched. She is unfeeling, has no qualms about sleeping with her best friend's husband, and telling her about it; or wreaking revenge on her rapist by descending to his depths, deeper even.The contempt she shows her son makes her character authentic, if not likeable. Do not expect to come away from this movie with strengthened moral values, only the dumb (like her son) are good people in this movie, and Hupert acts like a spider, drawing her targets into a web and injecting her poison.Yes, there are credibility holes in the story, but it is the amosphere, especially Hupert's mental atmosphere, that matter in ELLE."

" Elle manages to thrill audiences through exaggerative eroticism with questionable plot points.
",0.0772,0.9403,2018-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Psychologically stimulating throughout, Verhoeven portrays a different response to the invasive penetration of rape. One I haven't seen before, and considering the event in question immediately takes place as the film commences, the originality of this perspective bursts through the screen. A businesswoman, leading a video game company, is raped in her own home but decides not to report it due to past incidents with the police. Two vital elements of this production elevate it above the endless stream of psychological thrillers. Verhoeven's astute direction and Huppert's electrifying central performance. She, somehow, maintains a role that demands physical prowess and emotional damage. Her character's work life is so important and hectic, that she has no choice but to continue on despite the horrific crime that took place. Huppert magnificently conveyed rigidity, she was a strong character that you subconsciously admire her, even if her moral compass is slightly skewed. The psychological aspects remained refreshing as Verhoeven slowly peels away the complex layers that shroud this thriller. Plenty of backstory, substantial character development and an array of suspicious individuals, each carrying immorality. Some of the scenes, particularly the sexual encounters, felt reminiscent to 90s erotic thrillers due to the musical score. Old fashioned, yet nostalgically innovative. The problem, and it comes down to personal taste, was with a specific plot point that left the entire third act rather unfocused. Once the culprit is identified, Huppert's character seemingly continues sexual activities and it came across as hyperbolically forced, just to further illustrate her dementedness. It didn't work for me and released the grip that this thriller had on me. Also the relentless wave of unlikable characters really hindered the emotional response the story was trying to achieve. A decent thriller, one that is produced to the highest quality possible, but crumbles far too quickly towards its conclusion."

Her past includes a childhood trauma and her life is troubled in various ways among family, friends, and people at work. Things get worse when she is brutally raped and has a very unusual response to the situation.In the film's favour, it is very well directed by Paul Verhoeven who creates a dark and mysterious mood. He is well aided by the haunting musical score by Anne Dudley. Huppert is also marvelous in the lead role. This is to be expected as her presence and performances always raise her films to a higher level.The trouble is in the role itself as well as the script. Yet again, Huppert plays a twisted sadomasochist like she did in ""The Piano Teacher"". While she can be praised for taking on dark roles, it would be nice for the sake of contrast to see her in a cheesy rom-com in which her greatest dilemma would be deciding what to buy as a Christmas gift for a loved one.Despite potential sympathy for all that has happened to her, Michèle, like almost everyone else in the movie, is unlikeable. David Birke's screenplay has too many oddities and leaves too many loose ends by the conclusion. It also has a very contorted view of the traumatic experience of rape - something that leaves a poor taste by the end."

The runtime of the film is 2 hours plus, which should give you a clue this isn't per se a revenge film but a journey, a discovery into self.Michèle is stoic. Some may even feel she is astoundingly dignified in her approach to handling the colorful men in her life. These are men that are vulgarly selfish and infinitely wanting: they don't stop with their harvesting at all.I liked the movie except I'm not sure whether I'd recommend watching it. The reason is that I find MichèIe to be mostly one dimensional (except towards the end), mechanical, and therefore unrealistic. Her reactions are too contained and her expressions frigid.If you don't have anything else on your list or have time to spare, I'd suggest only then you go ahead and watch the movie."

" Verhoeven and Huppert are among the best
",0.6369,0.7227,2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Dutch director Paul Verhoeven began his career in his native country with movies like ""Soldier of Orange"". In the '80s, he moved to the US and directed a series of audience-pleasing movies (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers). In the 21st century he returned to Europe to resume a serious career. His latest output is ""Elle"", starring Isabelle Huppert (in an Academy Award-nominated role) as a rape victim reluctant to report the incident to the police due to suspicion of them.Huppert's Michèle is one of the most complex characters that I've seen on screen in the past few years. She runs a company that designs video games (that's the last thing that you'd expect of a middle-aged woman, especially a French one). She's haunted by the memory of the arrest of her father, who committed a horrendous crime, and now has a strained relationship with her son. It seems that her friends and cat are the only ones with whom Michèle has a truly healthy relationship. But there's a lot more to discover about each of the characters. No one is truly what they seem.This focus on sexuality, repressed memories, and relationships adds up to one of Verhoeven's best movies. The acting and subtlety of the plot show that a focus on people - as opposed to action - is what a movie needs to be good. I recommend it."

Critics are clearly out of their minds. 
A complete waste of time and mindspace."
" What an unconvincing pretentious loads of nonsense!
",-0.4574,-0.9956,2018-02-08 00:00:00,2,"Having read many reviews on this film, it's fair to say Elle splits opinions; it's either a masterfully acted, powerful psychological drama, or a convulted piece of drivel with gratutitious sex and violence. I was intrigued to watch this after reading some of the reviews, particularly of Hubbert's 'Oscar-worthy' performance, though disappointly, I happen to share the latter viewpoint. This is a film trying to be clever, and getting it all wrong. I have so many issues with this film; Firstly, for it to be a great psychological drama there has to be some genuine intrigue as to who the mystery rapist is. Considering there's only really about 2 or 3 possible suspects, one of whose character's is never built sufficiently for it to be him, and another is quickly suspected then discounted in the same breath, it hardly becomes a real whodunnit... more of a baffling why... and even more bafflingly/ troublingly why she reacts like that. Also, why reveal his identity part way through and then have nothing come of it... it was quite anti-climatic (unlike all of her sexual encounters). The (totally pointless) back story of the serial killer Dad is perhaps meant to provide some explanation for why she troublingly seems to let all men, except her ex-husband and some random employee at work, walk all over her. She's presented as obstentiously this hard-nosed women who'll take no prisoners at work and who'll never forgive her ex who once hit her, but then but will forgive the random masked stranger who comes in, beats the shit out of her and rapes her repeatedly, yeah sure that makes sense. Perhaps she's meant to subconsciously feel guilty or unworthy of love, but that's never really expressed and she seems to have no qualms about cheating on her childless best friend and admiring herself in the mirror, so perhaps that's not the case. As someone else has mentioned, it's not just Michelle who has bizarre emotionless reactions to events. Really no-one in the film really reacts with anything even remotely resembling human emotion to anything that happens to them, making it genuinely difficult to relate to any of the characters. Her son seems absurdly dumb, grinning inanely in front of the clearly mixed raced baby in front of his black friend; her friend is oddly calm on hearing her best friend and husband have been cheating on her, the uber religious woman isn't at all mad/ sad her husband's dead, everyone is allowed to say the most offensive things to each other and just get away with it and after one car accident, two affairs, three break-ups, multiple deaths, several rapes and a cacophany of other shit that would bring down even the strongest individual no-one cries.... the whole thing is bizarre!The plot has more stories (and plot holes!) in it that a latin american telenovela. Everyone has some psychological disorder/ lazy stereotyping; the son is a lazy layabout, good for nothing, his girlfriend is a blonde pyscho, her mother is in denial of ageing/ ever been married to a serial killer, there's the pretty pious one, the ex with a thing for younger yoga instructors, the clueless, kind best friend, the sleazy lothario best friend's husband, the token black guy, the list goes on... The most troubling thing in this film is the portayal of woman and what they either do, or have to put up having done to them; Michelle, the main character; receives physical assaults for the actions of her father when she was a child, sexual harrassment at work by an employee, verbal assault by an employee, is used for sex by her best friend's husband - despite callling it off- after a car accident which leaves her in crutches and his response was 'well we won't be skiing' and then plays dead during intercourse, is harrassed by journalists and is raped several times - something she claims she can't report to the police because of her past involvement with her father's crimes, in someway implying she believes/ accepts she deserves it, and is beaten to the point of near unconsciousness. Her mother is used by a younger guy who wants to screw the wife of a serial killer, her friend accepts the betrayal of her best friend and suggests to move in with her and the daughter in law is presented as erratic, unfaithful, controlling and irresponsible. If anyone has pyschological issues in this film, then I'd say it's the director! He has a disturbing attitude towards women. If fact, it's pretty ironic this film is called Elle/ Her, as the perspective couldn't be any more masculine; of course she works making erotic, demeaning to women video games, of course she's letting herself be abused by a stranger, taken advantage of by a friend and showing herself as sexually provactive to a neighbour. Of course all women masturbate over a man across the street moving furniture - or they do Verhoeven's sick head. Of course she's wearing revealing, rip openable dresses and sexy underwear to be raped. Of course she tells her friends calmly of the rape, and then suggest they order food. Of course she has a terrible relationship with her mother, a disapproving reaction to her son's girlfriend and a jealous reaction to her ex's new partner. Verhoeven has made some kind of sick fantasy of his into a film, where this women secretly enjoys being attacked, beaten and raped. The rape scenes are genuinely shocking and if i believe they were done to show the horror of sexual violence I could just about contenance their inclusion, but to me they feel gratutitous and profoundly disturbing to watch, let alone film. In the week in which the topic of male director's subjecting female actors to distressing scenes in the name of art, it's worth again considering whether this is art, or abuse of power. Of course in his eye's a 'strong female character' means detatched and devoid of emotions and complicit in her own abuse. I really struggle to see how anyone can watch this film and view any of the female characters as strong, any of the reactions believable and any of the plot line convincing. Some good acting (Isabelle Hubbert should have saved her talents for a film worthy of them) and good camera work aside, this film is a farce."
" Michèle: Portrait of a seriously troubled woman
",-0.5719,-0.8444,2018-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Isabelle Huppert migh have signed a pact with the devil. She´s still incredibly sexy at over 60 years old and as unique as always. ""Elle"" it´s all about her (duh) and no other actress could have possibly made it. A classy production with moments of great tension but I find this to be a character study more than anything else. A woman and her circumstance: her family, her work, her friends and, of course, her sexuality. It might be controversial but it´s not cheap. She´s not an ordinary woman and her father and her mother both have an important role in the film as to know why. Everything else is plausible due to her condition, from her son´s character issues to her affairs and further. Nothing is taken lightly, every situation or decision is determined by her psychology.Now, I´ve seen how it enrages a lot of people. I guess they´re not familiar with Huppert´s work. There´s, of course, ""La pianiste"" but I find ""Ma mère"" to be worse. She´s always had a taste for moral uncertainty and she´s never been afraid of playing with its limits. Verhoeven is similar and this is a clear highlight in his appalling filmography. I wonder what would happen if ""The Clockwork Orange"", for instance, was made today? I´m not a fan of it but it´s widely regarded as a classic. We shouldn´t forget these are movies, not real life. Violence or pshycopathy are still a part of the human condition, however unpleasant they might be. I´m unfortunately close enough to rape reality to assert my opinion. ""Elle"" isn´t overly serious and never tries to be more than it is: two entertaining hours of drama."
" An enthralling exploration of the taboo desires of slightly sociopathic people.
",0.2263,0.9396,2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Apparently so controversial that several American actors passed up on the opportunity to play the lead part and Paul Verhoeven had to take his long-awaited return (to form at least) out of the US entirely, this subversive pseudo psycho-sexual thriller represents a rather unique take on the tried and tested rape-revenge genre, moving far away from pure exploitation and instead heading into an enthralling exploration of the taboo desires of slightly sociopathic people. There's nothing really conventional about 'Elle (2017)' and that might be what makes it so compelling, with the absolutely phenomenal screenplay brought to life by equally engaging, rivetingly realistic power-house performances, and the fact that each intriguing new layer just feels so natural despite the brazenly bizarre tone and inconsistent pacing is a testament to the rich character development and world building that makes the piece seem so wholly believable. 7/10"

For me the biggest highlights were Isabelle Huppert's performance and the unpredictable, uncompromising depictions of sexuality.
The issues i've had with this film though were mostly the dialogue and the unnecessary and absurd subplots such as the Michelle's father backstory and the whole Vincent's girlfriend thing. To start with the first one, it really takes away from the tension and the seriousness of the plot to have surreal cheap gags(?) like him killing himself just to not to have to talk to his own daughter. I mean he literally killed about a dozen people and lived with it for another 30 years or so but its his daughter visiting him that gets him to be desperate enough to hang himself?come on movie.
The vincent thing is really predictable and clichéd , the scene when he first sees his son is straight out of a My Name Is Earl episode, and his girlfriend is your standart stereotype of annoying, unfair, demanding and cheating girlfriend. At the end of the day i find it very hard to believe that any of the characters in the film(except michelle) could exist in the real world as they seem very cartoonish and one note. 
All in all was a decent film even with some serious flaws.

" Verhoeven : Just misses the target again

Good stories told differently, thought provoking plot-lines, interesting characters and, of course, eroticism. Yet, I haven't found any of his films totally convincing. 'Elle' is another that doesn't quite meet it's aims. I think the narrative with multiple plots could have been better told by another director. Isabelle Huppert hold all the stories and the often implausible situations together really well and is outstanding as always but cannot lift the film above average. If not for her lead then the film would have been a 3 or 4 star disaster. Having said that I wonder if the great Miss Huppert is slightly tooold for the role. I think the leading lady is now in her sixties Michele is supposed to be around 50? At times it shows. I wouldn't recommend this film as a must see but would probably recommend it as a dent nights entertainment with good performances and some interesting detail."
" Superficial Approach to Complexity
",0.0,0.9681,2017-12-23 00:00:00,5,"I am not a follower or scholar of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's worked. I liked a few of his films a lot, others left me indifferent. However, I recognize that there is a gulf between the incendiary films he made in the Netherlands, and what he does now, after establishing in Los Angeles and becoming an ""international filmmaker"". Between the man who made ""Turkish Delights"" (1973) and ""The Fourth Man"" (1983), to the one that directed ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) and ""Showgirls"" (1995). There is a transition from his early simple and honest movies to the standardized products made with high budgets, that lack the disturbing world vision in the first works. And after going up and down, between poor works and other more successful (as the amusingly proto-fascist ""Starship Troopers"" in 2000), Verhoeven returned to Europe taking with him the expertise of industrial cinema, mixed with some viruses that affect the cinema of Los Angeles. In 2016 ""Elle"" was released, his adaptation of the novel ""Oh ..."" by Philip Djian, which provoked debates and controversies about the vision of the female world and the ""empowerment"" of women. Long in excess (2 hours, 11 minutes) and with a pastiche and monotonous musical score by Anne Dudley, ""Elle"" tells the story of an unhappy, perverse and sick businesswoman who is experiences a curious regression towards her past and old family ""values"" , after reaching the lowest point of her downfall when she is violated repeatedly by a masked man. I do not deny that similar stories can occur in reality or that everyone perceives the cinema in their own way, but I really do pass. Verhoeven applied the skin-deep ""know-how"" he learned in commercial films to a story that demanded a bit more rigor, perception and sharpness. He opted for effects and sensationalism: maybe it was always the same in his film prehistory in Holland, and I never noticed it, I do not know... The cynical and feminazi audience of these times ended up applauding a character without ethics, without love, only with an insatiable and almost dry vagina. The ""well-behaved"" world discovered Isabelle Huppert! The actress does absolutely nothing here that she has not done the same or better in countless times... I do not know how many films to mention, because I've always liked what she does: ""The Lacemaker"", ""Violette Nozière"", ""A Story of Women"" , ""The Ceremony"", ""The Pianist"" ... In short, to each his own. Surely, there are those who liked it and want French cinema to lose its own signature and resemble one more melodrama from Hollywood. Bon appétit."
" (SPOILERS) The worst movie you could watch to ruin an evening!
",-0.8478,-0.9965,2017-12-02 00:00:00,1,"I ended up writing an essay about how much I hated this movie and IMDb forced me to trim my review down. I started again, but let me be as concise and clear as I can be: don't watch this movie. It's so awful.1. It makes no sense at all. The characters are capricious and not in a fun, loving way. They are frustratingly stupid and moronic. You cannot connect with any character or feel empathy for them. I don't feel sorry for Michele basically asking to be raped. If she goes down into a basement alone and desires sex (as she admits at the end of the movie, getting laid was part of her goals), I can't feel sorry for her when she is treated badly. I lost any sense of feeling sorry for the character.2. The worldview is negative and idiotic. Everyone is apparently deaf, dumb and blind. Her mother ends up dying... just like that. The baby born two times darker than Vincent doesn't strike him as odd. It's silly and stupid.3. It won't leave you feeling educated, inspired or happier. It's a waste of time. You won't get anything but a massive headache, which I did get. I took a painkiller (wish I was joking), because the headache from that movie was intensely painful.I hope that no one wastes their time on this trollop. It's the worst movie I have seen to date. Again, I wish I was joking, but I have never seen anything this bad. This takes the cake, except the creepy neighbor will probably rape the cake according to this movie's standards.There are good French films out there if you want to find something fun to watch on Netflix. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
" provocative and more
",0.0,-0.9975,2017-11-16 00:00:00,8,"It is often unhelpful to try to squeeze a film into a single main idea and that is even more true if the film is a good one. But I am going to break my own rule here to talk about the latest film by Paul Verhoeven. Not that I think Elle lacks nuance, but without seeing the thread that binds this film together, the intentionally provocative tone of the film can detract from its merits and push the film into lazy pigeonholes: misogynistic, exploitative, incoherent and if you are looking for a longer list of pejorative adjectives, Richard Brody's review in the New Yorker is an excellent thesaurus.Elle starts with a rape scene and what follows is how the main character, Michèle, deals with this presumably traumatic experience. I say presumably because her reaction to this incident throughout the film defies all expectations of how anyone might react to an assault. After the intruder leaves her house, she gets up, with some difficulty of course, sweeps the broken plates off the floor, takes a bath and orders takeout for dinner. And when she finally realizes that the rapist after all was her neighbour, someone whom she happened to have a crush on, the viewer is confronted with another what-the-heck moment when she, this time willingly, gets herself beaten down again. Let's start with the easiest hypothesis to refute. This film is plainly not about the damage rape can do to the victims, the film doesn't even try to make the protagonist likable enough to get the viewer's sympathy. A revenge thriller with a strong female cast? Surely there is an element of revenge in the film but it is hard to reduce it to a revenge story when the protagonist is drawn to her rapist. A misogynist story, disguising itself behind a criticism of conventional morality to show rape as a common fantasy and not all that terrible in reality? If she, a woman with a strong and dominant personality throughout the film, subconsciously yearns submission, why does she have to ruin her dream came true by taking her revenge at the end? And here is why I think a single main force behind Michèle's actions can save us from this confusion, and that force is not morality, or a sense of justice or shame or anger, or the society's pressure, but the agency to do what she desires to do in spite of all that. What the film is doing here is highlighting agency by taking the notion to its unnerving and sometimes darkly comical extreme. After the assault happens, she is physically hurt but mentally settled enough to order a takeout. She doesn't call the cops not because she is embarrassed or afraid of telling people what happened, she tells her ex-husband and friends about the story in the restaurant scene after all, but why bother with the cops if she can take matters in her own hand? Her reaction is no different every time someone reminds her of her mass murderer father out of spite, she keeps calm and carries on. But why does she willingly fall prey to the neighbour's sadistic behaviour? Is she a masochist? Well, the last thing she probably cares about is we pondering what she is or she is not.This is not to say that Elle should be seen as a manual on how to handle sexual assault, or as a realistic character study of Michèle and her motives. What the film does though, so effectively and so outlandishly, is bring to life not perhaps the most lovable but a memorably strong character that leads her life with the ultimate agency."

Which is quite funny when this film is applauded for being so unique and groundbreaking when it has been done so many times before. Only here we have a decent budget, an incredible actress and some average directing, but it speaks volumes about how critics perceive things, they laud films like this with stories that are from films they would ultimately pan. So like everything take the audience score and the critic score add them together, then divide by two and that is roughly the quality of the film."

Not so ELLE, a somewhat convoluted psychological thriller based around the unappetising subject matter of rape. In the hands of the expert director, ELLE becomes a beautifully shot and well-crafted movie, one which remains enjoyable despite the darkness of the subject matter. Isabelle Huppert gives a finely-judged turn as the put-upon woman who reacts unexpectedly when she is raped in her own home one night. The narrative mixes together family drama, mystery, and psychology of an unusual depth, with the end result a film which subverts expectations and proves challenging and unique."

I am not a fan of Catholicism and I am as liberal as they come but it just went too far - imho.No likable characters either.

The acting is excellent with Huppert being her usual great value for money. She has excellent support from everyone.

Having been abused, Michèle goes on as if nothing had happened. This can be attributed to the traumatic past of her character. Her childhood has hardened her, which makes her psychologically interesting. However, the importance of the shocking event is further undermined by an avalanche of everyday events such as office work, family squabbles, and shallow interactions with the ex- husband, friends, lovers and subordinates. The crowning scene is the Christmas dinner which the victim organizes herself. It is full of uncomfortable silences, malicious remarks, jealousy and deceit which are not funny but laughable in light of the background events. It seems that it doesn't serve any other purpose than distracting the spectator and in turn trivializes the abuse. After all, Michele pays as much, if not more, attention to her dinner guests than to her abuser. Additionally, 'Elle' doesn't have a genre. It starts out as a psychological thriller, becomes a bad comedy with the dinner-party ending in complete chaos, morphs into a crime drama as both Leblanc's parents die one after the other, and Michele sits down with the police to discuss the murder committed in her own house, and ends with a Hollywood happy ending as everyone goes back to their lives and carries on unperturbed.The tension throughout is so diluted I ended up asking myself what the film was about. Did it tell the story of a hurt, psychotic woman? Was it trying to warm audiences to perverted sex? Or was it a distasteful Christmas comedy? (To be frank, an hour in, I expected Will Ferrell to fall down the chimney dressed as an elf.) 'Elle' resembles an angry toddler's doodle-book rather than a film. You could have a look but not necessarily exhibit it."

This is reality.Everybody wants a pause from reality to fantasise. This is reality.The ranges in peoples beliefs are so brilliantly portrayed in this film that devout believers will question the films integrity rather than question themselves.This is a stellar film with stellar performances and pans out as a documentary rather than a fictional film. It shows the depraved nature that we all have, that we are dumbed down to keep in check with a brilliant cast and beyond brilliant direction.This is a sex game that both participants wanted....Hence its ability to offend and be berated and applauded. It wasn't a rape, it was a game in which both suggested and made it real.If you are brave and open minded please please watch.If you watch the news avoid...because you will be liberally offended.10/10."
" Too overrated and disappointing
",-0.4939,0.9423,2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"I checked this out when it came in the theaters. I had really great luck not having seen it on the great screen. Instead I bought the DVD very cheap. A reviewer wrote that this story lacks of cleverness. I agree with him totally. Which woman wouldn't call the police if she has been raped or even hurt dangerously. This is an example why Elle let me without any special emotions or suspense. At the end I can only say that was it and I will never see it again. Save the money for a much better movie in the cinema. If you are interested in this genre of film I recommend to see Don't Breath, The General's Daughter or 8mm. Too overrated here: 5/10"

Looked like a good thriller, but turned out this movie is a far fetched joke of a flick. The acting was subpar and the writing was baffling. OK SPOILERS AHEAD!!! A woman that likes being raped? Really? And if you buy that piece of crap, then how about a woman that likes being beaten and injured? Really? I have no idea how people can rate this movie at a 7. AVOID at all costs."
" Fascinating and demanding
",0.3818,0.9831,2017-08-16 00:00:00,9,"Fascinating and demanding, on many levels. This movie gave me a great movie experience when I saw it. But it is demanding to look at. There is also a movie that I remember afterwards and it somehow ""gets stuck"". The story is about a wealthy and powerful woman who is exposed to a brutal assault. We follow her in the aftermath and get acquainted with a demanding character, imaginatively portrayed by beautiful Isabelle Huppert. Her character is hard to love, as her behavioral pattern is abnormal and unpredictable. Who is she really? What does she want? The story in the film also shows her life and how she appears inside her network and family. This gives the film an extra dimension, while pulling into her quest for who attacked her. This is be both fascinating and exciting. And thrilling. But the film is brutal, but there are not violence for the sake of violence. Rather a tool in film. The film also gives an insight into dark lusts in people minds. Things are not always what they look seem like. This is so much better than American films with a similar storyline. Recommended."
" Disgusting and stupid in every way imaginable
",-0.7783,-0.9851,2017-08-10 00:00:00,1,"So, after being brutally raped twice, we are expected to believe this woman has no trauma symptoms and can function totally normally (even cleaning up after the rapes and ordering out!). Gee, Paul if masked man raped you twice, you think you'd raring and ready to go, just as you've portrayed the main character. This is what men want to believe, that ""everything just shuts down,"" that rape isn't totally dehumanizing, torturous and barbaric, and that perhaps this is their misguided and creative way to come to terms with their own transgressions (be it outright rape, groping, objectifying, using, abusing etc.). If you want to see a real movie about rape check out ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" The revenge scene will give a bit more of an understanding of what women go through when raped, you sick piece of rotten plankton. This movie tries to teach the audience that brutal rape is not only acceptable but really no big deal at all. Not too many Feminists saying much about this one either."
" Not the rape/revenge comedy many paint it as
",-0.2755,-0.624,2017-08-07 00:00:00,9,"I think most descriptions of this film do it a grave injustice by focusing on the rape and mystery elements, as if this is some kind of a thriller. While both of these elements exist in the story, it cuts a much wider swath than that, ending up as both a character study and a sort of pitch black social satire. Not a single character in this story isn't essentially despicable, and it's a testament to Verhoeven's deft touch that he doesn't alienate the viewer. It's a consistently surprising film anchored by a truly outstanding performance by Huppert."

How French. Her mother has sex with a much younger man. How French. This is an insult to rape victims. I'll bet they think so. A woman is not going to be raped and a) not call the police and b) not be traumatized by the event. This character just takes a bath and washes it off of her. At the end she realizes the man has raped others and NOW she must call the police? What nonsense. Don't waste your time."

A middle class, intelligent, confident woman is violently raped by a masked home invader... and she is fine with it and enjoys it, as the same rapist breaks into her home and brutally rapes her again and again.

Those who have given 'clever' positive reviews to this film are equally guilty as its makers. A Golden Globe Award goes to the pro-rape propaganda Elle.

" It's easy to see why everyone in Hollywood snubbed this project...
",-0.0258,-0.9986,2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Elle is probably one of the worst films I've seen in quite some time and is nothing more than pretentious art-house nonsense that ends up having very little to say for itself...The central premise is troubling (the main plot focuses on a woman getting raped and then trying to track down the man that raped her). If this had been handled well then it could have been a fast-paced thriller where justice is served at the end of the film, but it rarely, if at all, ever plays out in this manner...To begin with, the film is unbearably slow and unfocused; the story is supposed to be about a woman tracking down the man responsible for raping her, but we rarely witness her actually trying to find out who attacked her. In fact, the rape scene is repeated on about 3 different occasions for no apparent reason?? It's also not a particularly easy film to become emotionally involved in as Michele doesn't seem to react to being raped in the same way that most women would react; she tells a group of friends that she's been raped, but just shrugs it off after that and doesn't report it and generally seems unfazed by what has happened to her. The film then crams in other uninteresting sub-plots; her son and his mad girlfriend, her ex-husband and his young partner. They all play various clichés that seem to just be there to make up the numbers and fill the running time as they are not developed at all, add very little to the story, and never have more than one dimension.I think the most disturbing thing about this film comes with the reveal as to who actually raped Michele and the direction that the story takes from this point onwards; again rather than reporting the man that carried out this appalling act she again carries on as though nothing has happened; having dinner with him, laughing and joking with him. I just found it all a bit sick and couldn't make sense of it? It gets worse later in the film when we learn that Michele's loneliness meant that she enjoyed having sex with the rapist and had been having an affair with him for months? WTF??? What kind of a f***ed up message is that? I understand a bored lonely housewife wanting a bit of action, but with a rapist? I just found the whole film appalling and uncomfortable to watch.According to the trivia section, Verhoeven wanted to make this film in the US, but had to move production to France because no Hollywood actress was prepared to take on the role and after witnessing what I've just seen then this comes as no surprise. Verhoeven was certainly brave taking this project on, but as a social commentary it is a misguided, clumsy effort that lacks any real insight and as a thriller it is unfocused and dull.All in all, it's a thoroughly unpleasant pretentious art-house flick whose ambitions far outweigh its results."
" damaged character
",-0.4404,0.0072,2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is a ruthless boss at a video game company. She faces challenges from the game designer Kurt. Her son Vincent's pregnant girlfriend hates her. Her mother sleeps with younger criminal men. She gets brutally raped by a masked man who breaks into her home. She casually mentions it to her friend but never reports it to the police despite the constant stalking and the masked man's repeated returns. She recruits the company's IT guy to investigate users she suspects to be the masked man. She is self-destructive and working through her daddy issues.Director Paul Verhoeven harnesses the full acting power of the great French actress Isabelle Huppert. He pushes buttons as he often does. This is a dark and damaged character. It could have been more shocking if the reveal turns out to be something more. I was hoping for better twists and turns. This is a good actresses playing a damaged protagonist but not much beyond that.
" Surprised by the high reviews.

They all seem selfish, stupid and loathsome. At first, you do experience a bit of suspense and you want to see how the movie will play out and who the rapist is, but the characters are so annoying and all their actions and responses seem so unrealistic. It felt as if this movie was just an excuses to glorify rape, to try and make rape seem more like some sexy S&M act that can awaken some deep sexual desire in women. It's shameful. I'm sure every high rating of this movie was done by a man. These characters were toxic and this movie has a toxic message. There is nothing positive, no lesson learned and nothing entertaining about minimizing rape and it's effect on women, In My Humble Opinion! (French with English subtitles)"
" A film which shows contempt for rape victims
",-0.8957,-0.998,2017-07-05 00:00:00,1,"Today I have watched Paul Verhoeven's critically acclaimed 2016 film ""Elle"". It's hard to believe that I have watched the same film as the reviewers, because I look upon it as a speculative rubbish. If an American B-film director had made it with unknown actors, it would probably have been panned. It helps to be a reputable director and have the famous actress Isabelle Huppert playing the lead role.It's labeled as a""psychological thriller"". ""Elle"" is flooded with many distractions. Distractions are necessary to increase the suspense, but what about a film that totally lacks suspense? The word ""suspense"" is embedded in the term ""thriller"". It's no thriller, but maybe it's more a drama about a rape victim? The viewers expect that a drama film about a rape victim is truthful and realistic. There is little about the film's main character, Michèle, which indicate that she has been raped. She has admittedly purchased pepper spray and a small ax, but uses them against ex-husband Richard by mistake. The rape doesn't affect her sex life either. Michèle continues to be a sexual predator, sleeping with her best friend's husband and leg flirting with her married neighbor. Elle neither shows shame, guilt, fear of men nor anxiety. When she gets injured in a car crash, who does she call? ""Ghostbusters""? No, the rapist.I hope I'm excused, but I think this film is a mockery of all rape victims. It supports the male chauvinistic falsity that women really like to be raped. Elle continues to interact with him, even after he has raped her three times. Michèle is not, therefore, a revengeful rape victim, as the female lead character in Abel Ferrera's ""Ms. 45"".Some reviewers have made a point of Michèle ""turning tables"". She makes it difficult for him to enjoy raping her, because she pretends to be consenting, which rapists are known to dislike. Yes, but it this not strongly focused on. It is incorrect to claim that Michèle is a strong female character. She is the weak part and the rapist is the strong part - following the traditional gender role patterns. When the rapist's wife thanks Elle for being temporarily able to satisfy her husband's needs (!!!!!!!!!), you may really wonder in what period this film was made. I wondered when they were going to play ""Stand by Your Man"". Now I understand why French women got suffrage as late as in 1944.Rather early I suspected who the rapist was, and will not reveal that. Why didn't Michèle call the police? You see, her father was a famous serial killer and she wanted to have nothing more to do with the police. Michèle's eccentric mom in her seventies looks like a blueprint of Endora in the TV series ""Bewitched"" and she has a young lover.If you would like to watch a good film about rape victims, I recommend Ida Lupino's ""Outrage"" (1950) or Jonathan Kaplans ""The Accused"" (1988). I liked Verhoeven's ""Zwartboek"", but this film was both speculative and mysogynic.TRAILER.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM96ne-XiH0"
" Great acting job, but the actions of the character make no sense
",-0.0644,-0.4096,2017-06-21 00:00:00,4,"The first thing to be mentioned of this film is that the lead performance of Isabelle Huppert is fantastic. She covers all the range of emotions the director wants to give her, and you can feel her living the life of the character.With that out of the way, the choices this character makes seem very out of step with reality. The movie opens with her being raped, and then she goes about as if it's just another every day occurrence. Not only that, but subsequent decisions go against any type of logical progression. Call the police? No, she has a checkered past with them. Shy away from any contact with men? Quite the opposite, seduce and re-enact the rape.I'm not saying all women need to react the same if this were happen to them. However, the path walked here seems so far off as to be unbelievable. They can say she's trying not to be a victim, but I didn't see that. I saw an unlikely reaction."
" Elle est Mdme Huppert
",0.0,0.9933,2017-06-04 00:00:00,9,"We are presented with one of the best movies of the year 2016 (if not THE best). Although the movie might seem long (about 2,5 hours of your time), you will enjoy it for sure; that is, if you can stand the topic that it presents and then developed, which is mainly violence in different life aspects, starting with the rape of the main character, a not so young woman.The director has us well used to this kind of films where violence is the main dish; you just have to remember other movies from his filmography such as ""Robocop"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Total Recall"" and the maybe not so know in America movie, but one of his finest jobs (with the permission of the present film), ""The Black Book"". What ""Elle"" describes and shows on its opening sequence is something that will impact you for a while, if not shock you; the way it is projected, nothing harsh, but still real enough will not leave you unaffected. From there on the story flows at a pace where you are trying to discover together with the main character who is behind the attack against her. But not everything is as it looks like. We learn about her life, her past, her present and her future; and when you are starting to pity her, like really pity her, there is something that she does or happens that makes you change your mind really fast.Of course this movie couldn't be done nor could it have such a great impact if it wasn't for the amazing performance given by Isabelle Huppert. She is flawless on screen and just perfect in this role. A role that was rejected by many American actresses because of what implied doing and what they had to actually do in front of the camera, because let's not forget: this is a French movie, with French cast, French crew and a Dutch director, and there is absolutely no way that this could have been made in the USA with such a magnificent result. This movie is the French selected movie to represent their country at the Oscars, and I strongly hope that it will be picked up by the Academy as one of the five finalists for best foreign movie. Moreover, I sincerely hope that Isabelle Huppert will get many nominations and awards for her impeccable work, as she is still one of the best actresses in the world and she deserves to be reminded of it.A movie that is a must watch for everyone who wants to see something different, something more real or something just different. Although what happens is something that we don't like to watch or be aware of, this story is worth of your time as this is not the typical told story, where the victim feels sorry for herself or decides to go with a vengeance against her attacker. This is something different; less fake, less artificial and more real; showed in a European way, although at some points It could feel a bit surreal altogether. Watch it for a change, and it you have the opportunity to watch it in French, much better!"

We infer that some people are tortured souls or complicated. The ensemble cast did a great job circling around lead Isabelle Huppert.

It is not the disturbing, although definitely too reiterated masochism inside the main plot: had it been more exploited, it could have resulted in an interesting analysis of some perverted mechanisms inside the human mind. The problem is the presence of a number of subplots, just hinted at and never developed, that result in a total mess of situations and characters, leading nowhere, either in the good or in the bad. I would have appreciated at least a more coherent finale, which on the contrary seems a hurried and puzzling reconciliation of people and situations that seemed totally controverted and unsolved till one moment before. Isabelle Huppert does always a very good job, but unfortunately heading nowhere, trapped herself inside a difficult, but undeveloped character, with no safe or focused direction. On the whole, a disappointing and overrated picture."

That is a huge compliment as I watch one a day...But Elle, if it had stayed true to the trailer it could have been so much better. The story-line does not make any sense as it drifts off onto superfluous filming...The trailer and some of the high rating reviews talk of spine tingling surprises. It was easy to figure out who the mad man was. A good thriller will always keep you guessing, but this film, no guessing...But I stuck it out to the end and was disgusted with the end... So many ways this could have been one of the top new thrillers but bad writing ruined it...A travesty as the actors/Actresses were all very good.

Maybe she had some work done but it surely doesn't show like we are used to with other celebrities that had some procedures done. Besides her good looks she is also a good actress and that's also the case in Elle. She's the main character playing a successful business woman with a past, that is being brutally raped. She tries to find out who her rapist is and what follows is a sometimes strange but enjoyable story to watch. The whole cast did a good job in this movie. There is some provocative sexual tension, that is the main focus point of this story. A good French movie."

",0.0258,0.97,2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Most films with Isabelle Huppert follow a pattern of disturbing, cold characters that we nevertheless end up siding for if not actually ""liking"". For what is there to like in Michèle? She despises both son and mum. Also his star employee Kurt, her only friend A.*, her pitiful ex husband. Of course, her beautiful daughter-in-law Josie and her young ex husband's couple, Hélène. For different reasons, there is nobody she respects. She is alone for a reason, but goes through the motions of classy Parisian life as if nothing really reached her. She only laughs once in the film, definitely at a wrong moment.She knows how to manipulate people, thou. Her relationship with his psychopath father and his carnage is unclear to me, as well as her participation in it. ""She hates him"" but they burned the house down together after it until the police came.It's a film about sex and some sort of perversion (can't say more), but amidst the violence, Michèle seems to be getting the upper hand. In any case, she's so detached from others that one never really knows what pleases her, what does she want, where is her desire, actually. All the other characters are secondary, maybe Anna rises above the rest. The ambient of game creation as big business is well depicted, and her luxuriously French house is the main setting of this film shot mostly in interiors. Paul Verhoeven is a master at crafting gripping stories.It may not get into the history of cinema, but it's a pleasure to watch and leaves you thinking about the loose ends. Love the classical score, lots of Mozart. Like expensive wine, one shouldn't ask for too much to be satisfied.*by having an affair with his man, and the way M says so."

Through a second story-line they invented a reason why the police wasn't involved, but that is equally far-fetched. I nevertheless decided to see the end, hoping that there as some magical outcome which I hadn't foreseen but that does not happen either. Very disappointing."
" Lurid Potboiler with an Exceptional Central Performance
",0.0,0.9193,2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Isabelle Huppert gives an expert performance in this psychological thriller, one that justifies her Oscar nomination for Best Actress.The movie around her performance is of the tawdry potboiler variety, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Huppert creates a fascinating character out of Michele, a woman who is sexually assaulted in her home and then engages in a cat and mouse game with her attacker. She's a cold, rather unlikable woman really, and her reactions to the things that happen to her are puzzling, to say the least. Not surprisingly, some traumatic events from her past involving a serial killer father arise to fill in some of the blanks, and if they don't necessarily explain Michele, they at least explain why she's so unexplainable. Huppert resists the temptation to make this woman sympathetic to her audience, and it's a small miracle of acting that makes us sympathetic anyway. I'm not sure many actresses could have walked the tightrope she has to in playing this character.I think ""Elle"" has some pretensions to discourse about gender politics, but whatever it has to say is a bit muddled by its wanting more than anything to be a lurid entertainment. It goes on for far too long, but I will say that never once during its considerable running time did it go in a predictable direction, which in and of itself is a feat that makes it worth watching.Grade: B"
" Complicated relationships with frustrations result in more than one 'crime passionel'
",-0.7759,0.5954,2017-04-10 00:00:00,9,"Isabelle Huppert is convincing all the way as the executive mother running a turbulent enterprise with many artistic and tempered employees of creating violent computer games and has had a hard time and life creating her position out of an impossible start in life as the daughter of a mass murderer. Her position is seriously put at risk when she is assaulted at home by a masked rapist, the scene of which opens the film and sets the stage and the sustained suspense - not even when it is finally revealed who he is the plot ceases to thicken. Other people are involved, several employees and other lovers, and there is even a childbirth exposing the father as not the father. The main theme and red line of the film however is Isabelle Huppert's settling with her past, with her dying father in prison, with her grotesque mother, with her ex-husband and with her lovers, but she ultimately succeeds in emerging out of all the lies with her integrity saved and intact. It is therefore a very constructive film in spite of its shabby intrigues and decadent love affairs, one worse than the other, while at the same time it's an exciting thriller. The dialogue is intelligent all the way, and there is no risk of anyone falling asleep during its more than two hours in basically the same closed up environment all the time. An excellent if not outstanding French thriller and psychological drama dealing mainly with the ubiquitous human problem of sex.Paul Verhoeven is most famous for ""Basic Instinct"" with Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas 24 years ago, but this is equally intriguing and more complex. It's noteworthy, that Paul Verhoeven is 78 years old."

Yet the truly beautiful aspect about this movie to make note of is performance given by Isabelle Huppert who dazzles the audience in every single scene, truly one of the top actresses of our time. Only God knows why she didn't win an academy award for this performance.But my words won't do justice to this film, only one advice see it, you will not be disappointed!"
" Elle
",0.0,-0.9767,2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"This was only the second foreign language film I had ever seen in a cinema on the big screen, my first was Hungarian film Taxidermia, I only had my guesses what this French film, literally translated ""she"", would have in it, and I was looking forward to it, directed by Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls). Basically middle-aged French wealthy entrepreneur Michèle Leblanc (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Isabelle Huppert) owns a successful video game company, with her best friend and business partner Anna (Anne Consigny). Michèle has a ruthless attitude both in her career and her personal life, she is divorced from ex-husband Richard (Charles Berling) and is detached from her son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet), who is with a domineering, ungrateful and pregnant girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz), and Michèle is having an affair with Anna's husband Robert (Christian Berkel). Michèle's mother Irène (Judith Magre) is trying to convince her to visit her father, who is in prison serving a life sentence for killing twenty- seven neighbours in an outbreak, meanwhile Michèle is brutally raped by a stranger in a ski mask. Following the attack, Michèle buys pepper spray and an axe as self-protection, while she seeks to identify who the rapist is. The masked attacker returns and attempts to rape her again, but she subdues him, pulling off his mask she is shocked to discover it is Patrick (Laurent Lafitte), a banker and her neighbour who she was flirting with, but she decides not to call the police, or to increase her home security, they later bizarrely begin a sexual relationship, including her consent to roleplay another rape. Michèle's company is preparing to celebrate the premiere of their new video game, she is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the various facets of her life leading up to the celebration party. Michèle decides to confess her affair with Robert to Anna, she ends the unhealthy relationship with Patrick, claiming she will call the police, he attempts to rape her again, this borders on an attack and consensual, Vincent is there and bashes Patrick on the head, he dies. The end sees Michèle speaking to Rebecca about moving out of the neighbourhood, Rebecca expresses gratitude that she temporarily ""satisfied Patrick's needs"", Vincent becomes more assertive in his career and relationship, and Michèle reconciles with both Josie and Anna, now that both their relationships with Robert are severed Anna also offers to move in with Michèle. Also starring Vimala Pons as Hélène, Lucas Prisor as Kurt, Arthur Mazet as Kevin and Raphaël Lenglet as Ralf. Huppert gives a fantastic performance as the woman who is anything but a victim, surrounded by many weak men, I assumed it was going to revenge thriller, the leading female character getting revenge on men who did wrong on her, the disturbing rape attack is shown a few times, along with many sexual moments, but the other things going on for the leading female are equally interesting, all in all it is a most worthwhile psychological thriller. It won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!"
" A shameful piece of trash
",-0.4939,-0.9919,2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"I wish I could give this film no stars. It is no wonder that most female actors turned this part down. The fact that Huppert reportedly actually sought out to play this role outs her as a disgrace to women and thinking men everywhere. I had my doubts about watching this film after discovering that Verhoeven directed it. He has a history of making films that objectify women and show blatant misogynistic tendencies. Apologists for him and his film, who call him ""provocative"", should also be ashamed. Actually, everyone involved in this production should be castigated.The problems don't end with a premise that actually promotes rape. Characters don't act like realistic human beings; they seem to be puppets acting out Verhoeven's sick fantasies. But the lack of realism doesn't end with behavior, it extends to the lack of physical evidence of a brutal attack on a woman; no bruises, cuts, etc. after showing a man punch and slap a woman repeatedly.Without explanation, after extremely nasty behavior between multiple pairs of characters, in later scenes they are together as if nothing had happened. This is really, really terrible filmmaking. It should be avoided at all costs."
" Huppert's performance was the only redeeming value for me
",0.34,-0.761,2017-03-24 00:00:00,3,"Isabelle Huppert plays Michèle, the woman referenced in the title. Some reviewers have remarked on there being humor in this, but I would not advise anyone to go to this expecting any knee slappers. The opening scene features a brutal rape that makes it hard to imagine its being filmed more graphically. That scene sets the tone. If you are looking for sadomasochism, infidelity, lesbianism, and masturbation, you will find it here. Mix in some repugnant scenes from a video game being developed by Michèle's company, a car crash, and Michele's detailing the exploits of the mass killings of her father and you have a movie that is difficult to watch.Maybe the humor is to view this as a satire on a certain segment of upscale, tech-savvy French society, but if that was the intended takeaway, it flew over my head.Huppert gives a strong, nuanced performance and that was pretty much the only thing I could appreciate. Michèle is a woman who, after the initial rape, picks up the phone and, instead of calling the police, orders out. That certainly turns the current attitude toward rape on its head, until you understand that Michèle has some private reasons for not going public. But the scene does alert the audience of Michèle's being a strong-willed force of nature. I can't think of any admirable male character in this. Is part of the message, ""Men bad?""In sitting through a difficult movie like this, I hope for some compensatory reward, but this movie did not pay off for me."
" Rather tawdry with a dubious message.
",-0.3612,-0.946,2017-03-23 00:00:00,6,"Paul Verhoeven has a track record that would not immediately make you think he could make a movie that would empower a strong central female character, particularly one where sexual politics (and sexual violence) are key to the narrative.He's the man behind Showgirls and Basic Instinct and, errr, Diary of a Hooker after all - essentially exploitation movies to a greater or lesser degree.And it's highly debatable whether Elle succeeds in its goal, if indeed that is it. Because, despite the incredible central performance by Isabelle Huppert (rightfully Oscar nominated) it takes her from rape victim to rape fantasist over the course of its two hours.Or did I misread it?The opening brutal rape scene knocks you back on your feet and Huppert, as Elle, a successful career woman, recovers from the ordeal remarkably sanguinely and continues her active lifestyle whilst setting out on a revenge mission of sorts.But that mission is deeply twisted and her horrendous experience seems a little ironic perhaps when we discover she is the owner of a games design company that produces games with dubious sexual morality.What's more her father has a deeply unpleasant past, also wrapped in violence in which she was implicated as a child. This only serves to complicate the morality message of the film as a whole.I found it gratuitous overall. I didn't think Huppert (despite an excellent performance) advanced female rights and I think the whole thing turned out to be verging on tawdry and certainly too ambiguous to make its point effectively."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.993,2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Elle"" (2016) is a great drama, solid mystery / thriller and a great character study film. And what a character we have here. Michèle Leblanc is probably one of the most memorable screen characters I've seen in many moons. She is superbly written, dark, hilarious and one of the kind. Acting by Isabelle Huppert was phenomenal. I didn't saw ""La La Land"" so i can't argue who should have won Oscar for best performance, but i kinda think Isabelle Huppert was deserving it more - this is a brilliant, multi-layered performance. And there isn't a bad or weak performance in a whole movie. It is amazingly acted, terrifically written and also superbly directed movie. Overall, ""Elle"" is like a breath of fresh air. It avoids all clichés, its not predictable for a second yet always plausible story superbly told. And even the background of what she does in her life (head of game developing company) is fresh - i kinda expected it to be some art gallery owner or stuff like that at the beginning of movie, but there isn't anything predictable in this movie. This is a one great and hard to forget film."
" Manages to be both a character study and a nailbiting thriller
",0.1027,-0.988,2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"At the outset, ELLE appears to be the story of a rape. Michèle's horror starts with the very first scene and rape is essentially the premise on which the whole movie rests. Rape is the lens through which this movie is viewed, a dark vision of humanity.Michèle tries to find the perpetrator in what at times feels like a detective story. But then amidst this crime story, she also has to deal with her son's questionable life decisions, a secret love affair, a malicious father... in short, the full catastrophe of human life!The movie is shockful of complex characters with ulterior motifs and unfulfilled desires. Everybody is either sad, depressed or longing for something—and if they seem otherwise, you immediately suspect pretence. All of this complexity is reflected in and through Michèle, who is played by the magnificent Isabelle Huppert and holds everything together. Her character is reminiscent of Hamlet in terms of how many internal struggles she faces, jumping back and forth between hatred and loneliness, self-loathing and pride, frigidity and desire. Yet this complex bag of character traits and human emotions never collapses under Huppert's brilliant performance.The director Paul Verhoeven knows just well enough that in order to make this movie work, one needs to simply hold the camera on Isabelle Huppert's face—she has an aura of respect surrounding her when she doesn't speak, and when she does speak, she's all the more impressive. It took me a while to get into her unrelatable character, but in the end it was worth the emotional effort, as I felt myself carried deeper and deeper into her abyss. Some of the cringe-worthiest moments in the film aren't those that deal with direct violence, but those that uncover the coldness in everyday social interactions.If at all, my only concern regarding ELLE is that having so many twisted characters in one spot connected with each other with so many bad things happening to them is a tad bit unbelievable. In that sense, the story is a bit pretentious. But if you take ELLE as pure fiction and as an allegory for the atrocities of human life, then this can easily be ignored. If you let yourself go, you're in for a wicked ride of violence, sexual perversions and French wine."
" Verhoeven + Huppert = subversive, 3rd rail baiting fun.
",0.34,0.9924,2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"Whatever you think this movie will be about it is not. Paul Verhoeven has never been better or more provocative. His past film work has often touched the 3rd rail of social norms & morality & this film practically gives it a bear hug. It is gleefully dark.Isabelle Huppert is phenomenal as the amoral CEO of a graphic (emphasis on ""graphic"") video game company. The film opens with a shock as she is brutally & sexually assaulted. The first face you see, however, is that of her cat implacably watching the act. Huppert's ""Michele"" treats the aftermath with the same sort of chill. She will not let herself become a ""victim"" defined by the violence done to her.The movie becomes a study of manners of her & the people she is surrounded by --good & bad-- & it is, more often than not, hilarious. (The rest of the cast is great.) You don't know if she is plotting her revenge upon her assailant or trying to put it behind her. The assault is always there but takes on less importance. What becomes fascinating very quickly is Michele's past & present. It is one of the best & nuanced characters I've ever seen in movies. If you want to champion her ""female empowerment"" you can. She is not a terribly likable person, but you have to admire her backbone.Verhoeven's style may be more muted her than in his previous films but he still pushes boundaries of tastes. There is a French coolness & sophistication that perfectly fits the hot button themes in it & that leads to some very funny & cutting scenes. (But I laughed uproariously at the excellent ""Gone Girl"" too. Nothing bad happens to ""the cat"" in either movie. Whew!)If you are opened-minded to the unexpected & casually cruel then you'll find ""Elle"" to be one of the best movies of the past year."
" 'Shame isn't a strong enough emotion to stop us from doing anything at all. Believe me.'
",-0.7907,0.9313,2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"Isabelle Huppert is a brilliant actress whose career has included many superb films for which she has been honored abroad. In the USA she is recognized in the Oscar nomination for this overly hyped thinly disguised treatise on the chaos engendered by sexual dysfunctions in every aspect of life. Paul Verhoeven ('Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct', 'Spetters', 'Black Book' etc) seems to plead for audience indulgence in this overly long, poorly edited story based on Philippe Djian as transcribed for the screen by David Birke ('Gacy', 'Dahmer', 'Freeway Killer', etc). The thrust of the film reflects child abuse, parental hatred, and the resultant self-hatred of a successful woman whose career has been enhanced by her brains and her odd libido.The plot is tough to summarize without including spoilers, but halfway through the interminably long film the mystery is gone and the rest plays out in a tediously slow and graphic manner. The wealthy middle-aged entrepreneur Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is the owner of a video-game company surrounded by employees that either hate or love her: she runs the powerfully successful business with her best friend Anna (Anne Consigny). She is divorced from Richard Leblanc (Charles Berling) and has a love affair with Anna's husband Robert (Christian Berkel). Her loser of a son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet) lives with his girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz) who is pregnant (the surprise at the birth of her interracial child doesn't seem to be noticed by anyone but Michèle). Her mother Irène Leblanc (Judith Magre), an inappropriately hyper-sexual woman who plans to marry a male hooker Ralf (Raphaël Lenglet) tries to convince Michèle to visit her father who is in prison for a life sentence after killing twenty-seven neighbors and animals in an outbreak 30 years ago, an incident in which Michèle was an unknowing participant. One day, Michèle is raped in her home by an assailant in a ski mask, then promptly cleans up the mess and resumes her life. She buys pepper spray and an ax for self-protection while she seeks out the attacker. When she resolutely tracks the man down, they are both drawn into a curious and thrilling game - a game that may, at any moment, spiral out of control. She befriends her next door neighbors Patrick (Laurent Lafitte) and Rebecca (Virginie Efira) and invites them to a Christmas party at her home. When the stranger breaks in her house again, Michèle subdues him and has a surprise.Of course the audience knows by now. The sequelae of the last B&D rape has permutations that affect all those around Michèle's sick but financially successful life. In a word, this is overdone, poorly edited, exceptionally graphic tedium. But Huppert is a brilliant actress....."
" A Twisted Celebration of Female Empowerment
",0.0,0.9415,2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Michele (Isabelle Huppert) is brutally raped in her living room. After the assailant flees, she casually wipes herself, then orders sushi. When her son visits her later and asks her how she got the bruises on her face, she says she fell from her bike. She is just as nonchalant about what happened when she tells her friends (amid some very shocked glances) as when she starts looking for the rapist herself.The assault doesn't stop her from flirting with her married neighbour, nor from sleeping, yet again, with her best friend's husband. At some point, we learn that Michele is the daughter of a convicted mass murder, who slaughtered half the people in her street when she was little, and then it pretty much dawns on you: if this hasn't managed to break her, a mere rape will hardly do it. Meanwhile, the rapist strikes again, but this time Michele successfully fights back. She manages to stab him in the hand, tears the mask off his face and finds out who he is. Yet, not only does she do nothing to bring him to justice, but when she crashes with her car, it is him she calls to come and get her.Michele is not the only one who is a bit 'off' in the movie ('off' here being an euphemism for 'twisted')—this can be said about pretty much everyone around her—from her 90-year-old mother, who has a lover 60 years her junior, through her son, who wants to be a father so much that he doesn't even bat an eyelid when his girlfriend gives birth to a black baby, to her most trusted employee, who, in his infatuation with her, creates porn animation where she is—well, of course—raped again by a demon from hell.If you haven't guessed by now, the director of this lovely mess is Paul Verhoeven. No one other than him (or perhaps David Cronenberg) can concoct such a mixture of sex and violence and get away with it without being crass or vulgar. As despite the oozing sociopathic sexuality, 'Elle' is anything but vulgar. Quite the reverse, it exudes smashing, exuberant, despite-all-odds vitality. Scene after scene, Verhoeven and Huppert successfully convince us that whatever it is that happens to you, however bad it is, if you refuse to be a victim, if you refuse to give in, if you refuse to surrender, you can survive and get over practically everything. An incredibly strong female lead and an incredibly strong role for Huppert. It comes as no surprise why the movie is simply titled 'Elle' (She)."
" This is a very, VERY DARK film. But well worth watching. It will ask questions of you
",0.6124,0.3616,2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Movies like this, are why more people should give foreign language films a chance.Elle is described as a Drama, a Thriller and a Black Comedy. All of them are true, although comedy is a bit of a stretch, even a black comedy. This is a very, VERY DARK film.The film opens with a rape scene. The violent and vicious rape by a masked intruder of Michèle Leblanc, played by Isabelle Huppert, while she's in her home.This has caused some arguments between people who believe everything sexual is part of the patriarchy, and this this film, being both written and directed by men, is therefore exploiting women. Others feel that this film empowers women, by showing their complexity and strength.I found this film fascinating. Don't get me wrong, it's not an easy watch. Sometimes the story is a little slow, other times it's a very uncomfortable watch. None of that makes it less captivating. It's almost like a French version of a Hitchcock film.I will admit that I worked out (educated guess) who the rapist was, but I didn't expect the film to play out as it did. Its darkness reminded me a little of Nicolas Winding Refn's Neon Demon. Not in Demon's horror aspect, but as a dark thriller that asks questions of its audience, of their morals, of the strength of their stomach.Interestingly there isn't a character in the film you can truly like. On the face of it, Michèle is strong, almost bulletproof, when in reality, she is twisted up inside, probably due to an incident in her childhood, which the film spends a little time going into. Her son is a weak, spineless idiot, with a warped sense of responsibility. Her mother is a shameless, pleasure seeking narcissist. Everyone else seems to be cheating on their significant others. These are not good people. But, that's what makes them interesting. It's a person's weaknesses that makes them real, that makes them appealing. That allows you to see yourself in them. It's the reason why Batman will always be a better character than Superman. He has more weaknesses, more flaws, it allows you connect to him. For the same reason, you find yourself feeling slightly connected to these broken individuals.The film revolves around Michèle, and her search for the identity of the rapist, but it doesn't simply focus on that at the cost of everything else, there are a number of sub-stories unravelling around her, making this feel more like real life, in a slightly over the top and bizarre way.As I said, this isn't an easy film to watch, it takes an investment, in both effort and time. That being said it's worth it. This film will stay with you for a while. I'm sure this will become a film I reference. It's made me think, and I love that about it.This is a good solid film, and if you think you can commit 2 hours and 10 minutes to a subtitled film, and you can stomach some fairly violent scenes, then I think you'll get quite a lot out of this one.Give it a chance."
" Stultifying. Predictable. Shallow. Pretentious.
",0.0,-0.9868,2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"I can only wonder at the attraction of this hackneyed French social satire with its violent rape twist. Indeed I found it as funny, subtle and perceptive as what I imagine an actual violent rape to be. To clarify, that's not at all. The only reason I can score this cinematic abhorrence one out of ten, is the protagonist is female, middle aged and sexually alive. That's where the merits end. She is an emotionless, one dimensional superhero who, I guess, we are supposed to admire for her stoicism. The film is threaded with the post modern reductionist themes of the preposterously realised pitfalls of religious sexual repression. All of the characters are dislike-able. To say I didn't care about any of them would be to give them more energy than I care to. The weakly written caricatures (the botoxed mother, the sad divorcée academic, the steely business women, the cheating best friend's husband, the computer geek with a crushzzzzzzzzz) dryly wind their tedious way through a plot so contrived into cliché as to bewilder. The only real emotion we are exposed to, clumsily at that, is that of the son, whose travails are witlessly shaped into an utterly preposterous sub-plot. I think his story was supposed to be the comedy in the piece. It was probably after the first hour that I became so bored that I wanted to leave, but I was sat front and centre at the superb Clapham Playhouse with some travel bags at that. I thought, ""It's probably nearly over so I'll wait it out..."" I was wrong. There was another hour of pointless meandering events occurring within a dis- believable framework of base motives belonging to utterly charmless ""characters"". How can a film that graphically challenges concepts of sexual violence be so boring? Because it fails to challenge anything. Utterly. Maybe making sexual violence boring was Paul Verhoeven's objective all along, if so, then this is a tour de force."

All of the cast perform remarkably well with difficult material and a lot of the credit here must go to director Verhoeven. He keeps this stunning character lead thriller moving forward with ferocious delight even though the subject matter is so hard to digest. He is no stranger to controversy but this film really does go into those areas we would rather not go. A great script ensures that however unpalatable an action, a belief or a desire we will give the performer the chance to take us with them. We are certainly asked to engage with some less than cheery stuff here with multiple rape, mass murder, mothers behaving badly, indeed almost everybody behaving badly and much death but there is a compulsion for us to delve deeper. This belief and fascination in what happens however awful is a credit to script writer, director and the only actress who could have played this role, Isabelle Huppert. Remarkable."
" Vengeance is blissfully incredible
",0.0,0.792,2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"This review of Elle is spoiler free***** (5/5)YOU CAN'T BLAME director Paul Verhoeven for leaving Hollywood the way he did or for as long as he did. After dealing with controversy for quite some time after Showgirls and Basic Instinct, granted that isn't the main reason he left but it is one of them. After taking a decade out he's back as a changed man, and back to basics with his latest Elle, a rape/revenge thriller of a woman who is attacked by an unknown assailant and is caught in a game of cat and mouse to catch the man who did this to her. And it's fair to say he found the right actress to star in the film. French actress Isabelle Huppert has been brilliant before but here she is phenomenal, as strong-willed Michèle a successful business woman who works in the gaming industry until she gets her revenge after being sexually attacked. The film opens with a rape behind a black screen so we can't see it but its clear what's going on, however after this attack she doesn't report it to the police, instead she just sits there planning her revenge. She gets herself prepared for another attack providing herself with easy to carry weapons. It's a little bourgeoisie-esque in areas as she's mean to some people in her live more specifically her mother and her high sex-drive, she takes everything in her stride, sure she's back lashed at her job mostly for her age and her ideas of how to make a good game but she doesn't give up. She asks a young man named Kevin (Arthur Mazet) to work closely with her in trying to find out who made her the centre of attention at work, she asks him to hack into one of his co-worker's servers to track down who did that.It takes it's time to get stuck in, in some aspects but when the tension rises the film gets faster, as she never gives up in catching her assailant. She constantly has flashbacks of that moment which essentially gives her the stronger will power to plan her revenge even further, she never gives up. And this rape/revenge thriller has style, too, here feminism is queen it shows that she is a woman who has strength, she's provocative, persistent and also seductive, as she tries to make her sex life better with a man who's close to her. And Verhoeven gives her powerful past surrounding her previous family life and her serial killer father, who tortured her at a young age, it's rare to find an actress who can deal with this kind of emotional heft and Huppert brilliantly pulls it off. It's absolutely phenomenal and is just what we need. VERDICT: Verhoeven's first film in ten years is provocative, luridly mesmerizing and is endlessly thrilling. With an awards-calibre performance by Huppert, Elle is one of the year's best."

Most of the characters are of various levels of bad character; ranging from the faux nobility, naivete and idiocy of the main character's son, to her mass murdering father. Not surprisingly, the more religious the character, the worse a person they are portrayed as being (the opposite of what generally occurs in the real world, but this seems to be a film motivated by hatred rather than reality). Several hatreds actually. Besides religion, there is the hatred of women and of men. The plot can be summarized as: Woman is raped, but she likes it, so she continues her affair/multiple rapes until she gets tired of lying and sneaking around so she arranges to have her married rapist/lover killed. Pathetic waste of my time, and the talent of all who made it."

While most every plot synopsis will try to tell you that she goes looking for her rapist, she doesn't. She keeps living life as if nothing happens. She buys means of defending herself, then moves on. The rape is barely mentioned in the movie actually. Towards the end more stuff starts happening, but even then it's rather confusing and mostly just lacking any sort of intrigue. It's still just a woman living her life, doing her job, interacting with her family and friends. Nothing happens, and it's really unfortunate because Isabelle Huppert is actually pretty good. The movie spends an entire hour after the rape at the beginning leading up to an incredibly predictable plot twist that, because movie, was obviously the case. There's really no actual realism here. Anything interesting that happens happens in a fantasy-movie world where everything is predictable. Overall Elle is just a nothing kind of movie. It's not terribly boring (it is still boring though), but it's not interesting either. Huppert is good, yet I dreaded seeing her on-screen because that meant that the movie wasn't over yet. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this waste of both time and talent."

This movie is truly magnificent, it will shock, thrill and engage you in the oddest mixture of emotions you're likely to experience watching movies in this day and age of beige cinema. The psychological components stitched together with such nuance I was blown away. The acting is superb from the whole cast but above all Madame Huppert proves why she is the Grande Dame of Gallic Cinema and a tour DE force that i'm sure even Ms Streep would admire. Please watch this movie, it will leave an impact on you for quite some time, as only the best of movies can do."

I thought this could be the perfect vehicle for his unique sensibilities and the result would be a wonderfully controversial movie. While the film certainly flirts with controversy it ultimately falls flat. It also fails to work as a thriller, while numerous scenes could have been played for high tension the movie never really makes the viewer feel any level of fear for the protagonist. The script sacrafices trying to develop the main plot by including a large number of side plots and ancillary characters that neither add to the mystery nor help us understand the motivations of the main character. We spend an enormous amount of time discussing her serial killer father, however nothing ever comes of it. It simply never really becomes important to the plot at all. While I will commend the filmmakers for bothering to wrap up every loose thread and side-plot none of them seem particularly worth following up on and it only seems like padding out an anemic plot."

Despite this, I still the think the film could have been better.I am going to start with the negatives since they aren't many. The film is quite long and not always focused. The main plot is about a video game company executive named Michele who gets raped in her home. She tries to go about her life as if nothing happened but then finds herself drawn to the rape and the future instances, which really blurs the line between rape, consent, and submission to sexual desire. The film doesn't always stay focused on what it is at heart. Its honestly hard to pinpoint what the film is really about since there's a few points of focus. I felt the film doesn't have many likable characters. And why would it? Its littered with characters who fall into a theme of philandering. I think the film introduces ideas of religion and the psychopathic nature of Elle's father; all of which was unnecessary.The film is long and clouded by things that didn't exactly meaningfully add to the story. I wasn't really sure what the film was going to be about. That said, there's definitely a strong erotic basis for the film which is Verhoeven at his best. The film flirts with the idea of cheating, rape, and consent throughout. Its a pervasive film but its exactly what you would expect from the filmmaker. People will find this film to be disturbing and at times quite vulgar but it remains alluring and pretty hypnotic. As I stated earlier its a return to form for Verhoeven because he plays to his strengths by tackling a sexually charged film once again.I know Isabelle Huppert isn't exactly a household name but she should be after this film. Its a magnetic performance. Michele is a bitch at times but very assertive and strong. She explores her sexual desires and boundaries and can handle her life in a very stone faced manner. She has a very complicated past and even mentions she may be a psychopath. Michele is a complex character: honest and at times scathing but its a wonderful portrayal. The film isn't perfect but I think film lovers need to check it out and form their own opinion on this.7/10"
" A woman scorned, an a lot on your plate film, an erotic sexy thriller that's deviant and a very interesting fun watch!
",0.8925,0.7991,2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Finally saw ""Elle"" and I must say that it was one of the better suspense erotic thriller movies that I had saw in a long long time! It was very sexy and provocative and it pushed the limits as director Paul Verhoeven is known for doing just that!(I remember his classic HBO ""Hitchhiker"" episode ""Last Scene""). This film takes twist and you as the viewer grow accustomed to the pain and drama just as the lead character Michele does. Set in France and done well with French subtitles ""Elle"" is the story of an elegant cougar socialite business lady named Michele(in a fine and top notch performance from Isabelle Huppert)who as the head of a video game company is successful, yet after being attacked in her own home and being brutally raped things change. Life is a guess spin of doubt for Michele as no one around her seems who they are.Michele is a damaged soul anyway as her old father is away at prison on murder charges, and her relationship with her mother is strained and her co workers at work clash as her bed encounters with different members seems to be coming to much to handle. And Michele has an attraction to her next door neighbor Patrick(Laurent Lafitte)a married man who's not what he seems to be.Thru it all life and passion pleasure becomes a cat and mouse game for Michele it's like she grows use to it it's painful ways yet provocative and fun games. And yes many of the sex scenes are violent and raw and Huppert is one sexy woman as I liked her hot scenes of wearing silk blouses and sexy colored bras especially those black bras! Overall well done erotic film that's a showcase and character study of a high class society woman who adapts to pain and games blending it with the norm before ending it in a violent manner at games end, well done in a sly and sexy smart way from Isabelle Huppert."
" Worst movie I've seen this year (and I watched Sausage Party)
",-0.6249,-0.8561,2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie is absolute rubbish. I think a lot of Americans just view French folk as aloof and a bit mysteriously sexy, and this movie panders to that sort of conception. That said, it forces actions on people that are totally nonsensical. 1. She gets raped, realizes that she enjoys the experience, and then proceeds to get raped and re-raped a bunch of times because that's apparently what happens when you're attracted to your rapist and the power play dynamic? WHAT?! This makes no sense.2. Then, to get out of this little situation she's created, she has her emasculated son kill the rapist, under the guise that this will make him feel like a hero and will help him grow a pair. Also, his girlfriend with whom he has a child, also magically goes from being a total bitch to a somewhat tolerable human being. Right. Am I the only person who is outraged by the fact that people like this movie? I mean, the fact that it's getting good ratings is making me question everything in my life. Do I have the right job? Am I married to the right person? Is my car actually green?I don't know what's happening. Please help. And DON'T watch this impossibly stupid movie."
" Simple title, not so simple movie
",0.0,0.9617,2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"""Elle"" is a co-production between France, Germany and Belgium that resulted in a French-language film from last year (2016). The director is Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, who turns 80 this year and who has worked in film for over half a century. And if you take a look at what he directed in the late 80s, early 90s, you may see some familiar titles as well. But this one here is probably a contender for his best-received title when it comes to critics and awards bodies. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and lead actress Isabelle Huppert is a Golden Globe winner and an Oscar nominee for it, who may be in the best spot to upset front runner Emma Stone at the Academy Awards next weekend. The film itself did not succeed to get in at the Foreign language Film category. Maybe the subject itself and the occasionally pretty graphic scenes were too much for the Academy to stomach. Anyway, this pretty long work (over 2 hours) stars Huppert as a woman who gets raped and the film starts with this scene right away and shows flashbacks later on as well, so we are thrown right into the center of action here. Huppert by the way looks still really good for a woman way into her 60s.Anyway, the film (except the last third) stays mostly memorable thanks to the audience guessing who is the one who did it. With the exception of Huppert's character's son, there is thrown suspicion towards basically every male character in there. Be it her ex-husband, her affair, her neighbor, the colleague who likes her, the colleague who hates her etc. My money was on the colleague who likes her or the neighbor and I will not tell you if I was right. If the film is over, the more time passes the more it becomes obvious to me how Huppert's character really planned it all in finding the guy who did it. The moment she mentions the circumcision is really crucial and shows us how she is a woman with a plan and nothing really is coincidence. It was pretty obvious that death may be the only way out for this film and I genuinely wondered if this means the main character will die or the one who did this to her. Dead birds, dead mothers, dead fathers, dead video game characters, dead people from decades ago and there are more examples. The car crash also may give an interesting direction this film is taking and I did not necessarily expect it. It is all about the double life of the aggressor, about how he needs certain situations to fulfill his dark desires.This is certainly one of the best psychological thrillers from 2016 and I am okay with the attention it is getting. Apparent flaws like why doesn't she let the police check who is sending her these SMS make sense in retrospective as for the central character it was all about her own revenge. She says on one occasions that she decides when her father would die and it is also the same when it comes to her rapist. Still, the ending scene came a bit surprising as there was really no indication at all that the son would show up at their place all of a sudden. Besides that, it is interesting that she had sex again with the offender on a previous occasion and that she did not mind going through that in order to keep going with her plan and better understand how the man works exactly. Anyway, what I found surprising at the end is when she talks to the cop she is not scared of admitting she had a relationship with him and that was a bit strange as it somehow destroyed the aura of suspense surrounding her character. But maybe it was because she was worried the cops may find out about it and see through her plan to kill him. Anyway, this is certainly one of Huppert's most personal performances and it's even more impressive that I liked her in here because I am usually far more critical when it comes to her performances that are sadly frequently too similar. I think she did a convincing job here with a very intimate portrayal and it is certainly among the best revenge films of the last five years. Here and there, we also get to see a moment of comedy (like about a cuckold child), maybe to keep this film from becoming too depressing. And that's a good thing as well. All in all, not one of my favorite films from 2016 and I am not sure if it deserves any awards, but probably some nominations are okay I guess. I recommend seeing it."
" A movie for Narcissists.
",0.0,-0.9695,2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"Spoilers: There's a saying for a male who always has his penis on his mind; d_ck head. So what is the female equivalent? Slut, I suppose. The main character, Michele, is just that, a slut, and a narcissistic one too, and she is quite insane, perverse, and immoral. She is in essence completely disconnected from the heart.She's a special type of crazy because she has never experienced sanity, so she has nothing to compare it to, and that's dangerous. Her money and status in society and her posh dwelling place always remind her to justify her actions, such as cheating, and that she's doing life right, when in reality she is border-line dead. Oh, she moves her and there with pace, but she is next to death. Not just her, but her neighbors across the street, her acquaintances, co-workers, and relatives. They are all, literally, like demons.This movie apologizes for insanity and wraps it up in a story to justify it. It brings you into the world of people who don't know what to do with themselves, so their high points in life are raping women ""because it's necessary,"" stroking their genitals, pumping out a baby when you don't have the means nor the maturity nor a loving partner to do it with, decorated with awkward ""casual and polite"" conversations with fake smiles and laughter from a group of people who feel nothing but numbness or anger.As research material for the Psychologist, it is a triumph. The characters are believable! But do I want to watch them? Does it make for a good movie? No, it does not, for the same reason that I don't want to watch a movie that makes us empathize and feel compassion for a pedophile. This movie is moral decay in a time where the film industry -- not just Hollywood -- is losing its mind."
" Elle
",0.0,0.0967,2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"If Verhoeven's most famous film Basic Instinct was made under Hitchcock's influence then the film Elle is strongly reminiscent of Haneke's work, who also filmed in France and even cast Isabelle Huppert, the lead actress of Elle, in his film The Piano Teacher, which investigates similar problems. When Basic Instinct was created it was on the level of Hitchcock's cinematic classics, and was excellent in the visual and musical sense. Strong visual side characterizes Verhoeven's films, unlike Haneke's cinematic output which is typically gray, bleak and drab. It is very sad that in the film Elle, Verhoeven did not display himself as the artist he is.But the main flaw of the film is the miscasting of the main actress who should not be too young or too old. She should be in her forties, and not sixty like Huppert. The film is focused on one woman which is why it is important to have had an actress who is able to hold the viewers interest with her acting and her looks.The plot of the picture is also questionable and not convincing enough. The director could not decide if he wanted to do a comedy or a drama, and combining the genre elements did not prove entirely successful. The male characters are also not impressive either and the main villain when unmasked is not scary in the slightest.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2017/01/elle/"

" Salacious potboiler and black comedy proves decidedly entertaining due to Huppert's strong performance and numerous twists and turns in the plot
",0.8399,-0.9793,2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Elle is noted Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's first French language film and first film since Black Book in 2006. Verhoeven--known in the US for the original RoboCop in 1987 and Total Recall, starring Arnold Schwarznegger--based his film on French writer Philippe Djian's novel Oh, released in 2012. Elle, however, feels very American in its sensibilities and that might be due to the fact that the screenwriter is David Birke, a US citizen.Not everyone will like Elle, especially women. It concerns Michèle Leblanc, an owner of a video game production company, expertly played by the noted veteran actress, Isabelle Huppert. Right away one feels uncomfortable with the story as Michèle is the victim of a rape in her home by a masked assailant. She refuses to call the police as she soon tells some friends at a restaurant that she's had bad experiences with them and fears the publicity will ruin her business, which has taken her years to build into a success.Subsequent scenes in which the rapist reappears and attacks Michèle again in her home become even more disturbing as it appears Michèle is acting as if she's enjoying herself. This in itself is enough to turn off the average cinephile. But there may be a number of reasons why Huppert decided to accept the role. First and foremost, Michèle is depicted as a ballsy woman determined to protect her independence at all costs. Her back story is that when she was 10 years old, she was present when her father, now jailed for life, committed a mass murder involving dozens of victims. At that time, an eerie photograph of the young Michèle appeared in the papers and the public condemned her as her father's accomplice. Hence it took her years to overcome the bad publicity--which accounts for her steely demeanor.Despite the salacious nature of the narrative, Elle has so many twists and turns and bizarre sub-plots that one becomes engrossed in the proceedings, after one crazy thing happens after the next. There is Michèle's misguided son Vincent, whose surly girlfriend delivers a dark- skinned baby, and claims the baby is his; then there is Michèle carrying on an affair with Robert, who is married to her best friend and business partner, Anna. Michèle also must deal with her elderly mother who insists on getting involved with younger men.The main plot concerns the aforementioned rapist, who is eventually unmasked as Michèle's creepy neighbor, Patrick. After getting into a car accident, Michèle ends up calling Patrick to help her, and eventually continues to engage in sex with him, despite his role-playing as a rapist.Verhoeven somehow manages to bring this part potboiler and black comedy to a fitful happy ending when Michèle decides to confront her father by visiting him in the prison, only to discover when she shows up in the morning, that he has committed suicide the night before.More happy resolutions include Michèle's change of heart in reference to all the rough sex with Patrick and the apparent set-up where Vincent bashes Patrick's head in after he attacks Michèle for the last time; Patrick's religious fundamentalist wife who thanks Michèle for satisfying Patrick's ""needs,"" Vincent's newfound lack of passivity in reference to his once aggressive wife and Michèle's reconciliation with Anna, who forgives her for all the indiscretions with her husband and offers to move in together.For all those uncomfortable with the main character's unhealthy flirtation and role-playing with a rapist, the inclusion of an act of revenge, undoubtedly masterminded by Michèle, may be enough to warrant approbation after a skeptical viewer's initial misgivings. Coupled with the aforementioned plot twists and Huppert's extremely strong performance, Elle, despite its tawdry underpinnings, may prove more entertaining than the usual recently released American potboiler."
" Severely unfocused and underwhelmingly absurd
",-0.6908,0.7186,2017-02-13 00:00:00,1,"If this movie was a person I think it would be diagnosed with having severe ADD and dissociative personality disorder.The movie is so unfocused that every third scene is the climax of a totally different movie. It feels like a soap opera -- now this person gets raped, now they cheat, now that one dies, now they kiss, now this one's true nature is revealed, and on and on. And all through this severe lack of focus none of the characters have normal emotional reactions to anything, which is what's supposed to make this movie so amazingly absurdly clever but actually just makes it shallow and annoying. And then back to point one -- since no one really feels much of anything, it's very easy to change from subject to subject until we end up with this silly mess.There are some good parts. The main character does make you root for her, since she is a typical cool and ""strong"" female character -- which, in movies, means someone who is devoid of actual feeling and sensitivity. She's got sass and does what ever she wants with little regard for others, except of course when she's coolly letting herself be used and harmed for men's purposes, because of course that adds interest to her character and makes it provocative, gasp. There's the soap-opera intrigue that will keep you watching for some cheap thrills, twists and turns and red herrings and what not. And it is a overall a ""pretty"" movie with attractive people and places. But at the end of this movie, as with any soap, one feels cheated and wasteful of time. Skip it."
" A film that only the French could pull off
",0.0,0.9927,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love the way the French make movies. They're so damn thought-provoking. You leave the cinema with 100 questions, all of which are answerable in some way if you dissect the film. 'Elle' is no exception. There are a dozen things I still can't get my head around. It's a particularly twisted tale which strays far from expectations. Based on the synopsis of the film I thought we were for your standard revenge-genre film, but the actual film turned out completely different from that.Isabelle Huppert has been nominated for Best Acress in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards for her very fine performance here. She has already won the Golden Globe a few weeks back. Needless to say, she was absolutely brilliant. The intensity and complexity that she manages to portray to the audience shows the work of an absolute master of her craft - and that's without me even understanding the language she spoke. Instantly, I understood what her character was about (perhaps not to the extent I would later learn) and then not for one moment from then on did she let her portrayal slip. A brilliant performance that I would be very happy to see take home the award.Director Paul Verhoeven shows he is in complete control of his film. He's known for these types of films, where to an extent nothing is off limits. Every scene feels like it holds significance. Be warned, it is a very dark film in nature, but if you're not bothered by that then it is one not to be missed."

In this movie we do encounter many oddities as well. a very harsh rape scene (turn out to be a fantasy), odd behaviors of daughter in law, weird work harassments, lesbian relations, an extreme social stigma due to fathers lunacy. On the other hand, this is not a movie only about deviant sex or life grieves or modern time oddities. All the elements are well decorated through out the movie. one women in the center of everything looks a bit unrealistic, though it is well decorated and do not bother too much."
" Six Rape Scenes, Ridiculous Story Line, Huppert is Awesome!!!
",-0.6093,-0.9989,2017-02-07 00:00:00,3,"I was really looking forward to seeing Elle, especially since Isabelle Huppert is one of my favorite actresses. Just look at ""The Piano Teacher"". She is phenomenal! Have to say I did have some reservations reading a review that mentioned one brutal rape scene. OK. I can handle that. Not a fan of violent films but one scene. Really wanted to see it. So that's where it goes wrong and there are multiple things. First of all, you can see the story line. Huppert plays Michelle who is divorced from Richard. They have a son Vincent who is a clueless millennial with a pregnant girlfriend Josie. Michelle calls Josie, the girlfriend, psychotic. Curious since Michelle grew up with a sadistic serial killer father and it is intimated that she helped him with his crimes as a child before he was caught and imprisoned. This has made Michelle something of a celebrity and not in a good way. She has grown up and made a life for herself, married, had child, has real relationships, and runs a very successful video game company with her friend Anna. Anna is married to Richard. Michelle's next door neighbors are Patrick and Rebecca.The film starts off, yes that's correct, starts off, with the rape of Michelle by a ski masked intruder. She does not call the police but instead takes a bath. Later on she is raped a 2nd time, by the same ski masked intruder. Yes folks, there isn't just one rape scene, there are actually SIX rapes scenes if you include her day dream of killing the rapist during a rape. Sigh. It's a lot of rape scenes. The story plot has a lot of red herrings involving boys who work at the video game company and someone has made a violent video piece of Michelle getting raped by one of the creatures from the game. OK, Seven rape scenes in total if you count that one. Eventually the rapist is exposed, which is her next door neighbor and Michelle and he go on to have what could be questionably called consensual sex. Some other reviewer suggested that this explore how far one would go to fully embrace one's sexuality to the extent of sadomasochism and role-playing. What hogwash. The only thing I got from the film, was that her father was a sadist and killed people. And that coincidentally as an adult she gets involved with her neighbor who is a violent rapist. Ultimately this long, tedious film, saved only by Ms. Huppert's acting, as she is in every single scene, ends with the son coming in and killing the rapist. It's all very confusing and convoluted. I thought the story could be tweaked a bit better. It seems to me that Michelle sets her son up to interrupt the rape to help him in some way grow up. And that the killing of the rapist, helps her to become a nicer person.Does that sound like a good movie to you? I found it very disturbing and very long. I would have rather watched it on video. Sorry Paul Verhoeven, but a Michael Haneke you, are, not."
" Verhoeven's masterpiece.
",0.6249,0.2406,2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"A woman is raped in her home by a masked intruder. She doesn't report it to the police but decides to deal with it in her own way. She also happens to be the daughter of a psychopath now in prison for slaughtering 27 people. The director is Paul Verhoeven, now 78 but just as keen to court controversy as he ever was and ""Elle"" may be his masterpiece.It's also as far from your conventional rape revenge fantasy as you can imagine. For starters, it's often very funny albeit in the blackest possible way while working as a genuinely thrilling whodunit; the initial attack is only the beginning. It's also a disturbingly frank study of a warped psychology; in the end are the victim and the perpetrator that much different? It helps, of course, that the woman is Isabelle Huppert, perhaps the only actress fearless enough to take on the role. She's magnificent but then when isn't she magnificent. I don't think there is anyone working in mainstream cinema today who can touch her. And with Huppert in the lead you may be reminded of Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"", another classic study of a dysfunctional sexual relationship. Will it win her the Oscar? Almost certainly not; the Academy seldom embraces anything this dark but when they do pass her over the loss will be as much theirs as it is Huppert's."

If moral and ethical decay coupled with a total lack of self awareness, set in a mindless world of self indulgence is what you crave - then this is the one for you. It plays like an inside view of the moral depravity of the Democrat and Republican parties. The cast is first rate and Huppert's performance is exquisite - if wasted. As the protagonist she is completely unlikable. The attacker is played as marginally more human than the attack victim. Every possible universally held value is destroyed. Worse - nothing in the movie makes much sense; the overwhelming improbability of the premise is laughable. I found myself chuckling partway through it. That may have been the Director's intent."
" An almost awful & lurid film that exploits the female sex; Verhoeven a poor man's Brian De Palma
",-0.8024,-0.9355,2017-02-05 00:00:00,2,"As the header title notes, the director Paul Verhoeven is indeed a pale imitation of Brian De Palma.I saw this movie at the art-house where it was the only one film that plays anywhere where I reside at this time of writing, in a second-run circuit. Needless to say, despite my intrigue with the great French actress Isabelle Huppert, this movie is patently ludicrous -- so absurd that it demands the suspension of disbelief with some confusion as to the female psyche, as imagined from the male perspective as the armchair psychologist.I am not a feminist or a ""white knight."" Far from it. However, besides the risible and infuriatingly frustrating absurdity of the plot twists, this movie is unbelievably lurid with exploitation, that is demeaning toward the female sex.Even for the aforementioned actress, who has to be the bravest actress in this world, who is willing to take on any edgy film project that pushes the envelope, so to speak. Anecdotally, I saw The Piano Teacher at the same art-house venue, starring the same lead actress, exactly 15 years ago. Which is an incredible coincidence. Unlike ""Elle,"" The Piano Teacher is far more nuanced with Michael Haneke's clinical directing style, slow-burn pacing, and Ms. Huppert's astonishing portrayal of a tormented and psychosexually twisted character.In my humble opinion, Huppert's role in The Piano Teacher is one of the best performances ever captured by the actress; the other (equally and non-manipulative) astoundingly superlative performances being the fellow French actress Marion Cotillard for ""La Vie En Rose"" and Bjork's one-off-only lead acting in the poignant ""Dancer in the Dark."" But ""Elle"" pushes the envelope not only too far, but also shreds the envelope to the extreme edge, outside of viscerally obscene hard-core pornography.The MPAA is wrong to have given this movie a mere R rating. It should be NC-17, period.""Elle"" doesn't make any sense whatsoever, that confound me as to the point of the plot and subplots. It's a rather vacuous commentary on the female psyche, and the sheer ludicrous elements of the entire plot leading to the bizarre ""happy"" ending left me flabbergasted with frustration and disbelief, because this movie demands that I leave my brain at the door in terms of excessive suspension of disbelief.Paul Verhoeven has proved himself to be the poor man's Brian De Palma, the latter who, at least, knows how to pull off the crazy plot twists and intrigues without coming off laughably absurd, until recently in the last two decades, when De Palma simply went off the deep end, not unlike Lars von Trier in the last decade. ""Elle"" is simply ""Basic Instinct"" in reverse, and still as ludicrous as that infamous 1992 erotic thriller with plot holes and equally absurd demand for suspension of disbelief that infers puerile male chauvinist fantasy.This said, Isabelle Huppert is, as I reiterate, the bravest actress. I doubt that she will an Oscar for Best Actress (she had won Golden Globe Best Actress award last month), simply because the Academy members, in particular elderly and perhaps more prudish, will be so offended and outraged by the risqué content and absurd plotting in ""Elle"" that they walk out in droves midway or turn off DVD to eject in palpable anger, given that this movie is one of the most provocative ever made to date.That this movie made me cringe with horror -- and The Piano Teacher barely made me wince, being hypnotized by the great and magnificent Isabelle Huppert's performance -- especially with grotesque sexual content (not just rape acts but also involving other elements that are just as morally offensive) is quite an accomplishment. And I braved through Gaspar Noe's brutal and nasty films (I have not seen Nicolas Refn's films, especially ""Only God Forgives"" and ""Neon Demon"" that are said to have prompted walkouts). Ergo, ""Elle"" certainly takes the cake as the most edgy movie released in recent memory, outside the typically pretentious and over-edgy film festivals like Sundance, Telluride, Cannes and Toronto. Paul Verhoeven should be rightly called a hack, because he could not cease to direct the latest films laden with inane plots and perfectly ludicrous premises, as if he dares the audience to suspend disbelief by forcing us to leave the brain at the door, to be insulted and mocked for daring to question the parallel world of ruthless reality and plausible fiction. Verhoeven apparently hates the audience enough to mock us, and ""Elle"" is not an exception that belies his utter cynicism toward humanity in terms of values or the lack thereof.This ""film"" is borderline rubbish that thieved my ten dollars -- I seldom go to the movies -- save for Isabelle Huppert's courageous and competent performance, that no sane film actress in Hollywood and London will agree to by taking on the lead role that is perverse, dreadful and exploitative.I will be genuinely shocked if Ms. Huppert wins the Oscar for Best Actress, defying the odds given that ""Elle"" is the most infuriatingly ridiculous and deliberately provocative movie in recent years. * 1/2 out of four"

Don't expect to be wowed, but go in with no expectations and expect to be pleasantly surprised.The story is non-conventional, dealing with difficult themes but in a very strange way. It does court controversy a little, but not needlessly. I don't want to spoil the film for potential viewers but the film is not ""difficult"" or ""painful"" to watch. There are some scenes and themes that are meant for mature audiences but they're presented in a neutral, very distant light. You are more of a cold observer than anything.There is no ""gratuitous nudity"" - I think people don't understand what gratuitous means. These are adult, middle-aged people having normal lives. There are only flashes of nudity here and there (sometimes really less than a second) but that's it. I was not disturbed nor offended by the unconventional behavior of the protagonist. I think it's more offended to say that all victims behave the same and that there is a template for victim behavior that this film should've followed. Every person is different. Sometimes people do the strangest things. The media is filled with real life rape accusers coming forward that simply cannot explain their subsequent behavior toward their rapists. People have all kinds of defense mechanisms. They don't just curl up into the fetal position and cry in the shower.My issues with this film is that there are many sub-plots and they don't tie in well with the story. The sub-plots are either given too much time for something that doesn't tie in or not enough time for them to be tied in. They're in the middle of nowhere.This film also does something interesting in letting your mind play tricks on you, making you see everyone as a potential rapist in a crazy whodunnit as the world goes on.This film is not for everyone. I'm a person who couldn't handle Irréversible but this particular film was not a problem for me. It presents a heavy issue in a light way, and even though it may not be 100% realistic, I have to concede that we wouldn't want something too realistic anyway."
" Horro Porn
",0.0,-0.9905,2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"In director Paul Verhoeven's new film, men are brutes. The men in ELLE, a psycho/sexual/sadistic thriller, are cheaters, liars, wife-beaters, and ""gamers' who produce video games that are an extension of their puerile fantasies - bloody and savage. The movie begins with a close-up of a cat's vertical eyes - narrowed and expressionless observing a violent rape scene; we hear the pounding and stifled screams of struggle, but do not witness the scene until later when the victim relives itover and over. We eventually meet the rapist, costumed in anonymity who can only reach ejaculation's pinnacle of pleasure through rough, furious acts of inflicting pain as his launching platform for intense sexual rapture.Isabelle Huppert plays Michelle - a stylishly successful business woman who with her good friend runs a company which produces wildly graphic, titillating videos - where women are attacked by creatures who invade every orifice of their body with monstrous tentacles, etc - the more horrific the better. Safe from the fantasies that she peddles, Michelle has now become a victim of an uncontrollable psychotic - and like her cat, she does not reveal any emotion, nor does she report the event, preferring to plot revenge in her own distinctive way as she attempts to search out her attacker. The film slowly reveals the psychological underpinnings of Isabelle - her relationship with a father who was imprisoned when she was a young child for heinous crimes, her mother whose desperate relationships with very young men, in an attempt to maintain her youth, is broadcast on her taut stretched face - the scars of surgery. And Michelle's handsome adult son, who has not yet found his way and is about to become a father, though still being supported by Michelle.Sexual tension, desire and intimacy permeate this film. Isabelle Huppert is cool, amoral and calculating, seduced by the power of a sadomasochistic urgency into a dangerous situation which is audaciously grotesque. Walking a tightrope over lies and deceit creates collisions that pull and strain one's conception of self. When I left the theater, I kept wondering if I just saw a horror-porn movie or a titillating morality tale? Is Isabelle a victim or a participant? Ethical ambiguity permeates ELLE - and Isabelle Huppert is at the center of every scene - the ELLE of the movie - dominating every moment; a beautiful woman who is an enigma, rarely giving any indication of her thoughts or feelings, as we witness her shell slowly cracking."
" Sick man's fantasy being filmed
",-0.5106,-0.9774,2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"Such an unpleasant movie to watch. I had the idea that I was looking at a big sick man's fantasy. A woman who is abused and raped by everybody, even fantasy figures! And kind of likes it?? Or is used to it, so has sick fantasies herself because of bad experiences? Is that why she is interested in her rapist and starts some kind of sick relationship with him when she finds out who it is? It was not even a surprise who the rapist is. What else could be the intension of this story, as there is no story? I really don't know, but I would not recommend anybody, especially not women (I never thought I would ever see this about anything!) to waste any money on this movie."
" Deranged, strange, intense
",-0.128,0.8864,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I first heard of Elle after it premiered at the Cannes film festival. Several critics referred to at as a rape comedy, which raised my eyebrows, but the reviews were almost unanimously positive. And given Huppert's awards sweep I felt compelled to give this a shot and I'm glad I did. First up, the movie is definitely not a rape comedy. There is rape and there are moments that made me laugh out loud, but the rape is never treated as a joke and the comedy is more acerbic then slapstick. The ""elle"" (French for she or her) of the title is Michèle Leblanc, a wealthy divorcé who runs a video game company with her best friend and has an idiot for a son. The movie kicks off with her being violently raped by a stranger, but her reaction to this is atypical not only for movies, but for real life as well; she doesn't call the police or tell friends and instead tries to handle it herself by investing in some weaponry. The reasons for this are because of something in Michèle's past which we learn of later and adds a mildly interesting element to the proceedings. Unfortunately for Michèle, despite the fact that she is all too willing to let go of the rape, her rapist has different ideas, and begins toying with her, sending her vicious texts and leaving unpleasant surprises for her in her home. There have been those who have criticized the movie for using rape as a plot device and I have to say, even though the movie is well made and well written there are times when the fact that both the screenplay and the novel were written by men really comes through. The movie also devolves quite a bit in the second half, never reaching the tension and mastery that the first half of the movie achieves. That said, there are still plenty of reasons to see the movie for those not faint of heart. Verhoeven builds the piece like a Hitchcock thriller and there are so many moments of beauty and of humour. And what to say about Huppert? She handles the role with ease. If you're a Huppert fan this is a must, she is the film and it's satisfying to see her get the accolades she so richly deserves."
" The Life, Times, & Assault of a Narcissist
",-0.5859,0.102,2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Paul Verhoeven is as thematically ambitious, ethically challenging, impishly excessive, and darkly funny as ever in this, his best film since returning to European cinema. Isabelle Huppert is amazing as a destructive narcissist who may have inherited sociopathic tendencies and impaired empathy from her father and who creates video games riddled with overtly sexualized misogynist content, even after becoming a sexual assault victim herself. The assault sequences are not easy to watch, and I'm still wrestling with the ethical soul of the film, but Verhoeven takes, what on paper, should be terribly offensive and manages to humanize it, as well as give it an almost Hitchcockian air at times. There's a lot here about the sexual and social needs of men and women and the consequences of those needs on one another. Open to debate is whether or not the work justifies its existence, or that we need a man to tell this story, but taking all that into account, Verhoeven navigates the tricky material extremely well. The fact that it runs head on towards some pretty touchy subject matter means viewer mileage may vary, but personally, I've been thinking about it for days."

The closing credits for ELLE do NOT even include an MPAA rating number or symbol, since Sony knows that the Pope-appointed (see the 2006 documentary, *THIS FILM NOT YET RATED) U.S. Film Censors would ban the import of a flick about a ""Devout Catholic Dad"" shot-gunning 27 men, women, and children--not to mention six dogs plus a couple cats (at least he spared a hamster) with his daughter Michele (or ELLE) an accessory after the fact--with an NC-17 Black Box Warning. Not content to merely besmirch the Romans, ELLE goes in for some Equal-Opportunity anti-Semitism, as Jewish banker Patrick repeatedly beats and rapes his atheist neighbor Michele a few years later. Being the Official Propaganda Arm and Trade Promoter for Japan's Government, Sony naturally includes a gratuitous scene in ELLE in which Michele's German-made Audi sedan cartwheels off the road into some trees for no apparent reason (there's a director of Non-Japanese Product Disparagement for each of Sony's Sneak Attack Trade War flicks). After seeing ELLE, it's no wonder that the American Public is moving toward an Isolationist Government which will cut all imports from Japan."
" 8/10
",0.0,0.9703,2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Michèle (Isabelle Huppert) seems indestructible. Head of a successful video game company, she brings the same ruthless attitude to her love life as to business. Being attacked in her home by an unknown assailant changes Michèle's life forever. When she resolutely tracks the man down, they are both drawn into a curious and thrilling game-a game that may, at any moment, spiral out of control.One thing that is clear to me when reviewing this film is the hardship of doing so: ""Elle"" is uniquely singular film that touches upon its subject matter in an incredibly detached way which is why we are shown events and characters go down from a perspective is totally fresh and new even though it can carry through a little too much.What it comes down to is that how the film treats its characters is exactly reflecting of how Michèle treats them. There is a perfect correspondence of style to story and it makes for a fascinating watch. You are carried through into this characters world and you start to root for her in a very convincing way to the point that you find her to be the the moral measure of the film even though the actions in practice would be questionable from another point of view.This is what great art does in my opinion, it takes the lens of reality and turns it around to make the audience experience something in a new way, that's what this film does in spades. It is not trying to present a world where each character is entitled, there is only one right way and that it because Michèle sees things this way, it is just brilliantly structured storytelling that hits hard on its goals.Then of course at the center of all of this is Huppert's magnetic performance. When watching foreign movies a sign a of great performance is when thinking back I can't remember the language she was speaking, I just remember the character and how alive it felt. She sells every beat of this woman's methods and ideas, there isn't a false moment in what she does and she makes justice to a script that required the commitment she gives it to become convincing.Where I take a little issue is in the clarity of the succession of some of the key events. The film slightly glosses over a couple of key plot point which are maybe intentionally left a little unclear, but in my view, a little too far so. I had some difficulties, especially in the first act, in exactly understanding what went down and because of that I didn't understand Michèle's motivations in the early stages.Yet, once the narrative flow gets thicker it starts being overwhelming and you experience a solid character thriller with a multifaceted uniqueness that stretches from setting, to characters, to core material."
" Raped woman survives and thrives
",-0.6808,-0.9961,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"With his masterful Elle Paul Verhoeven joins the elite — Bunuel, Hitchcock — in seeing how pervasive is the perverse. He extends the explicitness from Hitchcock's Frenzy as he examines the power of the sex drive in a humanity devoid of innocence. Consider the two religious characters. Michele's father obsessively blessed the neighbourhood children on their way to school. Ordered to stop his blessing, he went mad and slaughtered a host of people — and pets. Neighbour Patrick's wife Rebecca is pure Christian, saying grace, watching the Pope's Christmas mass on TV, journeying to witness his visit. But it turns out she's known all along that her husband has been violently raping Michele — and thanks her for giving him what she couldn't. In a Bunuelian twist, Michele is first aroused by Patrick when she watches him carrying in the giant manger statues.Nature seems on the side of the sinful. Michele's cat witnesses the first rape with neither a squeal or a scratch to defend her owner. The storm rages enough to give Patrick the opportunity to come ""help"" Michele and try some normal sex with her. But he needs the weather's rage in himself if he is to perform. Paradoxically, the raped woman who was associated with her mass murderer father is attracted to the handsome banker who seems stable and virtuous (at least, Catholic). But that tall dark and handsome hero is the violent rapist who can't do normal sex. Everything — and everyone — is twisted.Michele's response to the first rape is surprisingly cool. She tidies up, soaks herself, then matter of factly proceeds with her life. She doesn't call the cops because she doesn't want to renew the police and press situation she suffered as a child. She prepares to defend herself against another attack and seeks in her acquaintances and colleagues any hint who he might be. When she tells her friends about the rape she retains that shell.And that's the point. Her childhood experience of her father's sin has left her unemotional, detached, even from her own violation. The press called her ""The Ash Girl"" and now she's the ash woman — dry remnants, all the fires spent. Whether masturbating at the manger scene or hand-jobbing her best friend's husband over a waste-paper basket, her sex is functional, free of passion or commitment. Her analytic remove contrasts to son Vincent's blind ardor for his bitchy fiancée and the obvious act ""his"" son is actually black. Michele supports him and tries to advise him but she lacks a motherly closeness. She even wonders if he might be the son of her best friend Anna, whom she let breast-feed him when her child died at birth. Michele's self-awareness and self-acceptance contrasts both to her grotesque mother's pursuit and use of young men and her ex-husband Richard's infatuation with a young Yoga teacher — who doesn't know his novels! Sex is an irrational drive towards all these characters' abasement. As is, of course, the sex Patrick requires of Michele and would likely continue to ""enjoy"" if Vincent had not stumbled into the scene and killed him. Vincent is as deluded about his mother's sex life as he is of his own.Michele has found a more sensible way to join the world of the young than her husband and mother have. Michele runs a hugely successful fantasy game empire that exploits the age's fascination with and fear of monstrous sexuality. The game scenes point to a society coarsened and savage in its diversions. It also reminds us how all art serves as a sublimation of our most compelling energies and drives. Patrick's brokerage (like his good glacially blonde Catholic wife) doesn't give him the fulfilment Michele's crew of gamers does her.The happy ending has the ironic sting of Bunuel's Viridiana. From the sequence of rape, blasphemy and betrayal a new relationship emerges. Having established the inadequacy of sex with her friend Anna's Robert, her own ex Richard and the violent rapist, now-dead Patrick, and not wishing to sink to her mother's hunger, Michele walks off with Anna. The first time they tried lesbian sex they dissolved into laughter. They have a cozy sleep together here. Whether they go on to a sexual relationship or to a post-sexual intimacy doesn't matter. They have survived a series of sexual and violent relationships and betrayals. They emerge beaten but unbowed. They've survived the destructive powers of sex — and have managed to make a fortune commercializing it for the frustrated adolescents aged 12-76. They are woman. They are strong."

NO RAPED WOMAN GOES TO DINNER AND ANNOUNCES matter-of-factly pass me the bottle of wine and by the way i just got raped. It often takes weeks, months, or years to recover. I came out of this movie upset, because i thought that is the line of conduct that is prescribed for the women to come??? (Below is the comment i made to the filmmaker's page in French) I rushed to see the movie as i have always loved Huppert Djian and i did love Basic Instinct that was smartly made. Here it is made entertainment--it had nothing to do with Basic Instinct that was a top movie. ELLE is a flop--with a lot of money and bad taste backing it... This 'coldness of being' is setting an example for the youth; let's not forget it. No one wants to make friends with the rapist--even if it is to take a revenge. It just sounds off--the whole movie!!! What message for girls?? Is this the future that we reserve for women--to act like a man, to emulate him in his violence??)

" Extremely disturbing.
",-0.5563,0.9827,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"'ELLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new psychological thriller from director Paul Verhoeven; his first film in ten years (and his first movie filmed in the French language). It's based on the 2012 novel 'Oh...', by Philippe Djian, and it was scripted by David Birke. The film tells the story of a business woman, who's raped by a home intruder and plots revenge; without notifying the police of the crime. It stars Isabelle Huppert; who won a Golden Globe (for Best Actress in a Drama) for her performance. The movie has won multiple other respected awards, and it's been nominated for even more; it's also appeared on many critics' top ten lists. I found it to be a really well made, and extremely disturbing film.Michele Leblanc (Huppert) is the boss of a successful video game company; with a submissive adult son (Jonas Bloquet), and two narcissistic parents (including a convicted serial killer for a father). She's raped, one day in her home, by an intruder wearing a ski mask. At first she doesn't tell anyone about the crime, but later she informs her friends; who insist she needs to tell the police. Due to her traumatic past, she decides to take justice into her own hands.The movie is extremely different than anything Verhoeven has ever done before. It's a serious character driven drama; and not an exploitative erotic thriller, or an ultra-violent action movie. I'm a fan of Verhoeven's other work, and I love seeing great artists (like him) branch out. Huppert is fantastic in the lead, and the movie is an amazing female empowerment film. It's slow-paced, and extremely disturbing (like I already said), but I definitely think it's a film that's worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"

I will have to explain in spoiler zone.To my taste, the character of Isabelle Huppert is contradictory. I can understand that other characters draw them cynical, more today. But the one of the protagonist is totally contradictory. While it is true that she is great, like the whole cast.The movie makes me long. I think there's a lot of footage left. It extends between too many topics, which for me are not the story. They only make us distance ourselves from the original idea.

Get it to look like a good movie if it was not for all, for me, script errors.The address is simple. Telling that for my taste, footage remains. The plans are neither studied nor beautiful. They simply observe the story.Everything else gets you into a story.

" The performance is the redeemer of this confused story
",-0.3869,-0.9893,2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"ELLE is a confusing movie, filled with inconsistencies and characters that feel flawed from the script level. Their motivations are at times unclear, and the plot wanders in and out of reason. Watching the trailer, one might expect a thriller of the highest order. Instead, Paul Verhoeven's latest film feels like a jumble.The film has been generating significant buzz since it's debut at the Cannes Film Festival, and I am genuinely curious about the film that I apparently missed. Here's what I gathered: a woman (Michele, played by Isabelle Huppert) is raped after a home invasion. She is in shock, but quickly recovers and moves on with her life. She does not report this incident to the police, and she only casually tells her close friends about it over dinner days later. Michele is apparently unaffected by the act, and is only curious to find out who the man is. She works as the boss for a video gaming company, currently working on a new fantasy game for PS4 consoles. She receives calls from the rapist, mysterious emails, videos, all indicating that the man knows who she is. She suspects a coworker.At the same time we learn about her biological father, a man locked away for life for unspeakable crimes he committed when she was a child. When it happened, she was looked at as a sociopathic little girl. Growing up, we see the hardened woman she has become, closed off to everyone (colleagues, lovers, her mother, and her son). On the outside, she has all the resemblance of a successful woman. Inside, she is a complete mystery.I will admit that while the plot had me curious, the ultimate message of the story was a complete turn-off: that a woman who is raped would be so intrigued by her attacker that she would lure him back time and again to continue his assault against her. I will tell you that she finds out who committed these crimes against her, and yet she does nothing to end his violence. In fact, Michele later goes to his house willingly where she is subjected to further abuse in his basement. It's presented as a two-way relationship in which both parties require torment in order to feel a connection. Passivity is not enough, these two get off on control.Verhoeven is no stranger to such topics, having directed English-language films like Basic Instinct and Showirls. Here, there is craft on display but very little to show for it. Even without the ""thrilling"" aspects, there are funny moments in the film, particularly around Michele's son and his relationship with his vile girlfriend. She gives birth to a black baby and the son is blissfully unaware that he is not the father. Michele meets with her mother frequently who is dating a man nearly 40 years her junior. In a world where crime is around every corner, Michele is unable to escape the madness in her own life.Though I am not familiar with Huppert's career as an actress, I will admit she gives a mesmerizing performance. With deep voice and piercing stare, she becomes a woman who is both fearful and yet able to instill fear on those she oversees. There's a commitment to her performance that is never ""over-acted"" and yet hits all the right notes perfectly. Were it not for such a spectacular show of acting I don't think I could have brought myself to rate this film so high.At this movie's core there is an ugly story. I can see the appeal of such a story, but with overly-gratuitous sexuality and shock value simply there for shock, I can't understand the final message. Who are we meant to root for, and who are we meant to hate? A movie can be well-acted and well-directed, but without characters that intrigue us even in the slightest, it makes for quite a bore in the theaters."
" Incredible
",0.0,0.9927,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Story: This film follows a middle-aged, highly successful woman who's life begins to crumble after she is victim of sexual assault. As she struggles to reclaim control of her life, events play out that challenge her, pushing her to the brink of what she can take. It takes a lot to make an audience accept a character so much that they follow them on such an intense journey, but from the first moment (which is highly dramatic,) you are on Elle's side, and want to see her overcome. While the story may not be original, it is told in such a brutally honest way that as an audience member, you place yourself in each scenario. This is the kind of story that you are uncomfortable the entire time, you want to stop and look away, but you're so engaged that there is no choice but to keep going, and wanting to see this woman overcome.Performances: This entire cast is wonderful, no one does a poor job, but this film pushes the main character, played by Isabelle Huppert, who's performance is mindblowing. She carries the entire emotional journey, hooking you in and balancing pretty much every human emotion it is possible to possess, all in a single performance that addresses such complex situations that it is astonishing to see. The brutality of the story, it's events and it's emotions demand the finest acting and strength. And Huppert certainly delivers that, and more.Craft: First of all, this script is stellar. It balances a combination of brutal honesty, heart-breaking and at some points, absolutely hilarious in a way that can be naturally believed. This script is tight, witty, real, honest and phenomenally brutal. But of course, the best scripts are only truly successful when partnered with a good director, and Paul Verhoeven delivers a powerhouse directing job. This is a man who understands people. He understands what makes people who have been pushed the furthest operate, and he knows how to harness emotion to make an audience be engaged from the first moment. It's top notch. Entertainment Value: As I've said, you are uncomfortable from the first moment of this film, but you are engaged in the outcome of the events, so you have no choice to look away. The film isn't ""entertaining,"" but it is gripping. It takes you places that you can't believe you're going willingly, and in some cases, you don't have a choice. As you watch Elle move through her path, the choices she makes are drastic at times, but you as an audience member understand them. And you're with her every step of the way. Memorability: This movie will be remembered. Whether a good or bad response, this is the kind of film that elicits a response, an emotional engagement that demands the audience's attention, and never lets you go even after the film is over. It asks the questions that many people will often ponder but never address, and hopefully will never have to. This is a film that is either fulfilling or completely disturbing, and will be heavily polarizing. But that is what truly great art does."
" If you have any self respect, stay away
",0.4767,-0.9693,2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"As a rape victim, I was really looking forward to this film after reading the description and a few top reviews. Those are misleading. If the larger public saw this film rather than just critics and film snobs (myself included) there would be outrage. I'm not upset about including a rape scene. I'm not even upset about Michele's character reacting so calmly afterwards. This is actually common in rape victims, and sometimes it's important to show things like this to educate people on the experience of survivors of sexual assault. What upset me, was when the film turned about halfway through to Michele enjoying the rape and encouraging it. This is not a reaction any sexual assault victim I have ever known would have. Maybe a few do, but when you take on a subject as serious as rape in your film, I do think part of your responsibility is in educating people on what that experience is like to create more empathy. This film did not do that, and I cannot say enough how outraged I am that this film decided to sexualize rape. Great acting Isabelle, but this film should have never been made."

That it won Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film simply informs me how out of touch I am with the sensibilities of the Hollywood Foreign Press. Or maybe it's how much the HFP is subject to current glamour, politicking and fantasy of what could have been. I think of it like The Artist winning Best Movie of 2011. Everybody liked it for about 5 minutes and then there was ""buyer's remorse"". (Reminds me of a certain recent election, too, but that's another story). Look, Isabelle Huppert is an awesome actress and I have no problem with her getting the recognition she deserves (thus the 2 rating!), but this movie is a mess as only Paul Verhoeven can construct. You will go out of the theater thinking: ""WTF, who lives like that?"", and ""Wait a second, that subplot was for...why?"", and ""OMG, how contrived can you make a character backstory to justify your tale of perversion and delusion?"". Lastly, I know the French have their cultural perspective on monogamy, art and what sexual and economic equality looks like, and I consider myself very accepting of different worldview and cultural mores; but this movie just left me with vomit in my mouth and a dislike for humanity. If for Verhoeven creating strong revulsion in the viewer is an art form, then I suppose he is a genius."
" The worst movie of Huppert so far
",-0.6249,-0.9568,2017-01-11 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie because I am a fan of Huppert and heard good reviews for this movie. I am shocked it is so wrong. This movie is a totally disgrace for Huppert. The movie basically says it is OK to rape women since women would fell in love with you or forgive you when you can do her some favor. The movie is out of touch with reality. No woman would feel so calm and so comfortable after the rape. No police and no cry ??? and secretly waiting for the rapist to return. No woman is that desperate !End of my rants. If you are a woman and can not tolerate any rapists with any excuse, stay away otherwise you will feel very bad."
" A very complex and unique tale of feminism !!!
",0.0,-0.4537,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"When it comes to 'Elle', the film that you picture in your head after reading the synopsis is so different from the actual film that you see. It is directed by Paul Verhoeven. The only Verhoeven films that I was familiar with before watching this were unique in their own way. They were really over-the-top, at times comically so, but they all had sly satirical layers to them. 'Elle' has some of the trashy elements in the storyline that can be found in those earlier films too, but here what's new is that the direction is very restrained. The restrained and low-key style of Verhoeven's storytelling in 'Elle' elevates what could be perceived to be a somewhat trashy gets elevated to levels of prestige cinema.'Elle' opens itself up to many interpretations, but I somehow don't think it is a film that is making a commentary on rape culture or any misogyny fueled social problems in general. I think it is a film that it completely and only about this character of Michele. The film goes out of its way to not make her angelic at all, as a matter of fact, she is at times sort of unlikable. I think the whole film hinges on the question of 'power', ego and manipulation. Michele was helplessly exploited by her father in his criminal activities when she was young and she had to endure such treatment helplessly. This must have shaped her mindset and psyche as everything that we see her do in the film is an attempt to exercise power over everyone else and not be on the weaker side of the power dynamics in any relationship. So she constantly manipulates things to gain leverage over everyone whenever she thinks the other person has the upper hand to her. Another example of this is that when she finds out Patrick is the rapist, her idea of getting revenge is not by calling the police, but by gaining the upper hand in the sexual encounter and forcing the rape instead of being the victim. Only after that does she decide to change and be a little nice to others. This is a feminist film not because the rapist gets killed, but because it's the victim who catches him instead of the police and gets to exact revenge in her own way.Verhoeven as I have mentioned earlier is very restrained in his direction. He doesn't go out of his way to compose frames that attract attention to themselves. What Verhoeven's camera excels at doing is capture Michele almost like a lover. We get to see every little expression and every little change in her facial gestures. Verhoeven completely devotes his time to observing Michele which helps the film. This brings me to Isabelle Huppert. Without Huppert, 'Elle' probably won't work at all. She gives dynamism, unpredictability and an oomph to the character. She expresses a whole lot through her eyes. This is one of the most complex, understated, yet extremely powerful performances I have seen in the recent past.However I think there are a few flaws in the film too. Although the storyline is a bit intentionally sensationalised, I did find the portions of the film devoted to Michele's son Vincent and 'his' child a little too goofy. I also didn't like the angle of Anne accepting and forgiving Michele at the end of the film as I think this undermines Anne's self respect. On a broader level, an argument can also be made that using a very sensitive issue like rape that has directly affected such a huge section of the global female population as a means to explore the ego drive and manipulative ways of a rich upper class French woman instead of addressing the issue on a social level is in itself problematic, but that is a completely separate discussion.'Elle' is an incredibly intriguing film with good direction and a brilliant central performance by Isabelle Huppert. It is not for everyone due to its provocative content, but one thing is for sure, it will continue to linger in the viewer's thought and every individual will get something different out of it."
" Tiring and unfocused... but brave
",0.6808,-0.9621,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"""Elle"" is a movie with much to recommend it, but perhaps one fatal flaw. It is an example of a movie which is less than the sum of its parts.Isabelle Huppert is our protagonist, a survivor of rape, and yet never really a victim of it. This is no rape/revenge tale. She makes the decision, for reasons we later understand, to not report the attack to the police. Even the rapist turns out to be more than we expect, and Huppert's relationship with him is one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie.So what, you ask, is the problem?It's simply too loose, too long. Too baggy. You find yourself losing interest and wanting it to end. The movie needed editing at the script stage. The only moments that really grab your attention are the scenes of violence, which are pretty standard thriller territory: the woman crawling away from the attacker, reaching for something to use as a weapon, perhaps finding something, perhaps not, while the assailant grabs her by the legs and pulls her towards him.The rest of the movie isn't glimpsed as clearly as this. Perhaps a great director such as Verhoeven should be given credit for letting the story breathe, but for what purpose? I never thought I'd be bored by one of his movies, but here we are."
" A Great Thriller from Mr. Verhoeven
",0.6705,0.6597,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"This was a movie that did a great job of keeping me engaged for the entirety of the film despite a couple small things. Firstly, it is decidedly harder to pick up on the nuances of the film if you are relying on the subtitles. Secondly, the side plots that go hand-in- hand with the main story line suffer from some convolution. That being said, the film wrapped up nicely with a dramatic statement on main character herself.Isabella Huppert was incredible in her role. By far my favorite performance from a female this past year. Her depiction of a independent and calculating woman was Oscar-worthy.The movie sets a tone of uneasiness from the beginning. The main plot device of brutal rape serves as a reminder that people can suffer unimaginable happenings in the human condition.Elle did a wonderful job of making me question the origins of the main character. As the movie develops and the relationships between the characters continue to grow, we learn more and more about the intentions and nature of her being.This was a fantastic addition to Mr. Verhoeven's filmography. I can't wait to revisit this film and discuss it with those who have also seen it. A solid 8/10."
" Isabelle Huppert Delivers The Performance Of The Year in this Psychological-Thriller!
",0.0,0.746,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"In 'Elle', We Find Legendary Director Paul Verhoeven at his riskiest & creepiest. Its a Psychological-Thriller, that brings its characters in unbearable & unforgivable circumstances. And Isabelle Huppert seems sporty enough to take the challenges & in return, Delivers The Performance Of The Year.'Elle' Synopsis: A successful businesswoman gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse as she tracks down the unknown man who raped her.Based on the Novel Oh... by Philippe Djian, 'Elle' sees a raped victim unaffected & believe me, you need a really strong stomach to absorb this story. Verhoeven tackles a subject as disturbing & shocking as rape & converts it into a thriller, without ever making it depressing. Isabelle Huppert's Michèle Leblanc, the protagonist, is a one of its kind creature, who refuses to be subjected or sympathized with after being violated by a masked man. Its a powerful & at times, despicable character, that is a mix of strength & agony.Expect Oscar Chase for Huppert, who delivers a performance that redefines the word ""embodiment"". I know, I'm the same writer who said Amy Adams in Arrival was the one to cheer for this year & oh boy, what a performance that was! But Huppert is the one who deserves that honor the most. When was the last time we saw a female protagonist this twisted & irresistible? I can't remember. So this will do.I won't add anymore details about 'Elle' & how Verhoeven keeps the narrative going. You need to see this film. Its dangerously beautiful."
" Shallow and Pretentious
",0.0,0.6115,2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"Incredibly overrated movie (On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 88% approval rating based on 117 reviews, with an average score of 8/10) While anticipating a movie like La Pianiste( with an amazing Huppert)this movie turned out to be the biggest movie disappointment of 2016 for me. Bad storytelling( just one example: Michèle leaves her son at the party, on arriving in the house she got raped( again...) and after a couple of minutes who turns out to be her saviour? Yes her son, a real Deus ex Machina....pffft..) The biggest flaw is the psychology and character building in this movie; behaviour of the main protagonist is like we are watching a drama from Pluto...erratic and impossible to empathise. Yes Michèle was traumatized is a child( in itself a grotesque story)but that explains very little about how she deals with the rape, with the people around her, etcetera. This movie was highly praised in Cannes and the world over, for me this is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes"
" yes, see it, but...
",0.4019,-0.997,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Elle is a gloriously f***ed up film, a film noir with a femme fatale who isn't out to screw some average Joe over or anything like that, but instead is a woman who not so much delights in her sexual perversity and taboo but does it out of not having any other choice it seems. The background on Michele Leblanc, Isabelle Hupert's character, is that her father was a murderous monster who killed several people (from my understanding of what the film says some kids too) and has been in prison for 40 years and may be up for parole. But did Michele, even at the age of 10 (and with a picture taken of her after a fire in her underwear as an ""Ash Girl""), collaborate with her father? Could this somehow tie in to her being raped in the very first scene of this film?Oh yeah, if you're looking for a ""content warning"" sticker rape and assault against women is right up at the top of the list. It's also a stalker, as the man who rapes her - and, at some point, will try to do it again - sends her threatening text messages and screws with her at work by changing some footage from a video game she's producing to have one character being sodomized and Michele's face pasted on. Why no one else in the office really questions this - is it just another of those hacks that have been happening lately - or why it doesn't become a much bigger deal in the story may be something of a plot-hole (or perhaps one has to take for granted that the French may react differently than an American would). But no matter - Michele gets a few weapons, some pepper spray, and is ready.Why not call the cops? Good question - would they believe the infamous daughter of this man who is so reviled that it causes complete strangers to throw food on Michele in public places? What makes Elle so disturbing and, to use a synonym for f***ed up, dangerous is where it goes with her reactions to what happened and how it ties in with a larger psychological pattern. This is a woman who has also had to put up with being in a loveless affair with one of her co-worker's husband, having a dips*** son who can't seem to get it through his skull (ala, uh, Me Myself & Irene?) that her girlfriend cheated on him and had a black baby which clearly isn't his ""but, hey, it's still my son so I'll be the father etc"", and her mother who is another piece of work, at least in Michele's view. Oh, and there's the neighbor across the street who is married to a good Christian girl...I don't think Verhoven even means to make this about rape so much, though naturally how he depicts it is rough and brutal and if you really find it repulsive to see even in a dramatized form then stay away from this movie, I mean it, than it is about... being detached from a normal sexual outlook on life (who knows, perhaps I'm reading in-between the lines a bit much here, if her father did things to her as a child before his rampage). In this way Elle would make for a splendid double feature with another rancid story of perversion and societal malaise as another Hupert film, Haneke's The Piano Teacher. Think of that kind of character in a way, only not so much frigid and clinically detached as not 'turned on' the right way.Clearly with where this story ends up going is meant to provoke and shock. I think with the exception of the son's sub-plot, which I found distracting in a way that didn't seem to help the film much (I think eventually there's some emotional moment between mother and son where he states simply that he could be a good father that does connect a little to what's going on, but it's too little and too late for me), because the focus is so much on Michele and the things that happen both to her and that she lets happen and that she does to others, the character study approach works. I was also reminded of another Hupert collaborator who did his share of risqué mysteries, Claude Chabrol, in some of the handling of scenes and how she has conversations with people. But once the movie dispenses with the mystery, well, it turns Full Metal Verhoven on us, in a way that's kind of delightful in a exploitationy kind of way (except that the way it's shot and acted it's too classy to ever get too down and dirty).So, do I recommend it? Yes, but, and it's not a simple but for me to leave here, I'm still wrestling hours after watching if it has more to say outside of ""sometimes damaged people are really, really warped forever and their transgressions can only stop by, uh, choice."" It's provocative and daring and directed by a master of this kind of stuff - in a sense it's also a more, er, mature, less s***-writing kind of Ezsterhaus script ala Basic Instinct - but a part of me thinks, what's the point aside from provocation? It's a conflicted high praise I give, the sort of look I give like the cat in the very first shot of the film - I wouldn't claw his eyes out either."
" If you thought Gone Girl was twisted, oh you have seen nothing yet.
",0.0,0.9545,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Trigger Warning(s):Rape (Multiple Scenes) | Domestic Abuse (Verbal and Physical)Noted Actor(s)Michèle (Isabelle Huppert) | Richard (Charles Berling)Characters & StorylineA rape within the first scene of the film sets the tone, as well as how Michèle acts almost nonchalant about it thereafter. For she has seen and experienced horror, so what is this but another thing to add to the list. Plus, there are mixed feelings about the whole ordeal it seems.That aside, she has too much on her plate to deal with cops, who she has despised since an incident in her childhood, for she is running a company with her best friend, she has a grown son whose girlfriend is controlling and erratic, and she is the mistress to a man who is barely satisfying anymore but keeps her on her toes.Though with it seeming her rapist has decided to become a stalker, and decides to take their obsession to her place of work, so comes a more cautious, though barely fearful, Michèle. For even as things become more serious, she continues to be unbothered for there is so much more to worry about than a coward who doesn't simply ask for what, if he is interesting and attractive, she may freely give.Things To NoteI think when it comes to the Oscars, and other award ceremonies, it is going to be between Emma Stone's likability vs. Isabelle Huppert's performance. But I say this before watching Arrival, Miss Sloane, and Jackie.HighlightsHuppert Is StunningWhile beautiful, yes, I mean stunning in terms of shock more than anything. The way rape is handled, the way she handles her odd mother, the past of her father, her staff, her friendships and more, it makes it hard to believe there was a time Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone, and many others were considered for this role. It seems almost written for Huppert who, almost in a Helen Mirren sense, has this eternal charm yet just as much seems she would kiss you on the lips and stab you in the gut over something you did decades ago.The StoryThe story is comprised of a few mysteries and it tries to redirect your attention and throw you off enough to the point you aren't just sure who did it, but what the reason could be behind it. For one thing, I don't think was often advertised, is Michèle's family past which deals with the type of act which has haunted one town for more than a generation. So with that, her working in a company where most of her male staffers reportedly hate her, then, of course, the usual demented who like stealing a woman's power, dignity, and comfort, you are left constantly question who could it be?All the while, it was strange to not see Michèle done in by the act. Which is part of the praise you need to give to screenwriter David Birke. Michèle is never written to be a victim. In a way, you can barely call her a survivor either for while she buys weapons and pepper spray, and has some PTSD, as the situation evolves you almost question the whole situation and whether you truly know what you think you know.On The FenceMichèle's RelationshipsI'm often conflicted when it comes to the role of supporting actors. Should they be presented strong enough to stand out, maybe perhaps even steal the lead actor's thunder, or should their character solely be about the lead's journey. This is something I struggle with, especially once the movie is over, for, honestly, while many of Michèle's family and friends have full lives without her, they aren't given enough energy or time to make it so their character feels even the least bit autonomous. I mean, even with us meeting one of Richard's, Michèle's ex-husband, girlfriends, it seems not so much about her ex moving on as finding a way to bring up why they divorce and show there is still some part of her that has feelings for him.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing) - RecommendedI was in awe, in shock, questioning every motive and decision, and like a child with my elbows on my knees just lost yet focused on the person speaking. And while, yeah, after the fact I was left questioning why some of Michèle's friends and family put up with her, and some of her decisions, in the movie you are so engaged that this is not even a factor.But what makes this recommended, and not just something worth seeing, is it's so different and isn't reliant on pity, nostalgia, or even the characters being likable. This is purely about performing a role, creating a universe, and bringing you in to the point you don't want to leave. Thus making me mad I didn't just haul my behind to NY in November to see this when it first came out."
