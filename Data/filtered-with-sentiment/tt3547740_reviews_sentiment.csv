" Flat
",0.0,0.3612,2021-03-22 00:00:00,2,"Being a native French-speaker, I have watched A LOT of French movies. Yet how this particular one ended up at the top of the chart baffles me. It is predictable, it is cliché, it is flat. The performances are caricatural. The plot is uninteresting. I still stuck till the end to see if there was an interesting twist or SOMETHING that would justify its hype: nothing. It it is the most common coming of age teen movie and completely forgettable."
" Plat
",0.0,-0.128,2021-03-22 00:00:00,2,"Je ne comprends pas le succès de ce film. J'ai toujours adoré Karin Viard mais franchement les performances dans ce film sont ultra caricaturales et sans intérêt. L'intrigue est plate et prévisible. Je me suis forcée à terminer le film pour voir si la fin rattrapait le tout, mais non, c'est sans intérêt jusqu'à la dernière scène."
" Beautiful refreshing jewel
",0.7506,0.9299,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"The cast is excellent.
I was very impressed with the family and the music teacher is just remarkable.
J'ai pleuré comme une madeleine à la fin. It's a movie that makes me proud of being French."
" Funny and inspiring, makes you think about your own life
",0.6908,0.4404,2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"A dramatic comedy which addresses the bonds that we have and that prevent us from being, in fullness, everything we want and can."
" Cinema Omnivore - The Bélier Family (2014) 7.4/10
",0.0,0.972,2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"""On the one hand, Paula's pedestrian life of school, singing training, budding romance and earnest friendship rides on a familiar narrative trajectory with an engaging tempo (though her first period incident risks to be too crude); on the other hand, her family's unique ""deafness"" is deftly exploited to elicit many surprising responses, such as the heart-felt confession that ""being deaf is an advantage!"" from Paula's mother Gigi (Viard); the tactful foley arrangement offering a deaf person's perspective of ""listening"" and Rodolphe's tender touch of feeling her vocal chord when Paula belts out; to say nothing of the killer finale, when Paula simultaneously sings and gestures Michel Sardou's JE VOLE in the audition, that is magically tearjerking and uplifting at the same time.""read the full view on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks!"
" Really touched my heart. Struggles with growing up
",-0.2023,0.8295,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"No instagram models. No make-up or fancy clothes. People. Just real people. Some lovely ones, friendly. Others greedy, moody, not so nice ones.
In between them a family with s teenage girl and her process of growing up.
Tge special thing is that all of her family are deaf. So she's the sign language interpreter.
With an incredibky beautiful singing voice....
Enjoy the rest."
" good comedy
",0.6597,0.8244,2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"A family comedy with tears in laughter, a good film that is easy to ignore, and no exaggeration or funny French humor. A family of four is deaf and mute. They are inseparable and have a hard time making a gesture. They are amused every minute, and they are all kind of touching smiles ... The last 5 minutes of singing were cured to the end. ""Dear parents, I will leave you, not to escape, but to fly"""
" A feel good but essential movie
",0.2382,0.872,2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Funny, sad, inspiring. This movie illustrates the challenge of many when challenged by caring for people they love and having their own aspirations."
" That's what I call cinema

" Impactful movie with an extraordinary Louane
",0.0,0.9682,2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie is very charming and knows how to put you under a spell. The starring is extraordinarily good. The family's handicap is not the centre ot this movie. It is about the young girl Paula, who tries to transform into a woman, while her childhood gets roobed by acting as an adult already during her young years.Louane Emera does her job very well and knows how to put feelings into her play to underline the theme of the movie. As a very special aspect the film does not try to point a finger directly at what the intentions are.Besides the drama in the main act ""La famille Bélier"" also contains comedy and when Paula has to translate at the doctor's this scene is full of external shame.
Louane Emera is a very good singer which she proves throughout the whole movie. The scene in the end where she has the audition is so good that it makes you burst into tears. Very impactful.""La famille Bélier"" is entertaining and contains a very intersting topic that also can convince visually. Unmissable"
" Original storyline, teen drama meets French cinematography
",0.3182,0.9864,2018-02-12 00:00:00,9,"Loved the storyline, sweet but not cheesy, not your standard teen drama, but offering a genuinely valuable insight into the fears and hopes that go through the minds of young people. It has the added interest of providing the rarely seen perspective of a deaf family. 
The French is very accessible, so I would recommend it for French learners at either A2 european level (onwards) or working towards their French GCSE (use French subtitles!). It creates valuable cultural links in the classroom to both Michel Sardou´s classic songs, and to new teen celebrity Louane Emera, a finalist to the French version of The Voice. 
Definitely worth a watch :)"
" Average singing voice with lots of hype due to disability angle
",0.0,0.9561,2017-12-24 00:00:00,2,"The family is a deaf family, so it has great critical reviews and reviewer hypeWhat the movie does not have is an actress with an amazing singing voice, the girl with the 'undiscovered' voice would never make it past the first round of a talent showI figured to so this review in case anyone is actually interested in the singing quality. The main actress is supposed to be this exhausted farm girl, but she always looks like a well rested girl who is pretending to be tired. The angle on the rest of the family is unique, I will give it that.With some effort they could have found a girl with a great voice, but i guess they succeeded with the movie on the disability angle"
" Great, fun, foreign-language movie
",0.8126,0.9785,2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"A breath of fresh air after the cookie-cutter formula of Hollywood, this charming foray into the world of the deaf is a huge success despite the handicap of Sub-titles, which unusually, blend easily into the story...Set in rural France, the director employs humour, music, family values and teenage spirit to gently build a web of emotion that pulses to the final scene.No sex, profanity, fast cars, drugs or perversion required in this poignant story...it moves at a perfect pace and is well-worth your time."
" Feelgood movie
",0.0,0.9912,2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Before watching La Famille Bélier I thought I was going to have a couple good laughs because François Damiens plays in it and his sketches as François L'Embrouille on Youtube always make me laugh. But the quite opposite happened, him being deaf and mute in a family of deaf and mute is not the ideal scenario for laughing. But there are some funny moments. What is for sure is that La Famille Bélier is a roller-coaster of emotions. I'm not too shy to admit I had some tears rolling at one point, from happiness or sadness I don't know. The only thing I know is that I liked the movie even though it's not necessary the kind of movie I would go for normally. The story is pretty simple but effective. The cast is well chosen with some excellent acting. Basically it's a good story, a feelgood movie, and sometimes we need that."
" A quibble...
",0.0,0.6369,2017-06-20 00:00:00,6,"An enjoyable, if slight and somewhat predictable, comedy. One unbelievable moment: that the daughter Paula, quite obviously well into puberty, should be experiencing her first period. It provides for unintentional silliness when the full-breasted actress menstruates unexpectedly and is humiliated. This is one weakness of this film, which occasionally sacrifices logic and consistency to propel its cute story forward."
" Beautiful and touching!
",0.636,0.8703,2017-03-10 00:00:00,9,"I really liked the story. It's both inspiring and beautiful. It makes you realize how challenging it can be for deaf people to cope with society everyday life. The cast is excellent. The voice of the girl is really stunning, so pure, you just stop breathing to focus on that voice. The parents are a bit annoying in their stubbornness but I suppose it's how their role was written.This film reminded me about another (excellent) french movie: 'Intouchables (2011)', also about handicap Vs society. It was also funny and touching."
