" Great epic / historic action film
",0.6249,0.9901,2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Great epic / historic action film.
Jackie Chan has a more serious role than usual, as Huo An, the commander of the protection squad for the Silk Road, like a modern commander of the UN peacekeepers of those times. They welcome and protect a pursued Roman company by the Roman emperor Tiberius. Among them is the future
legitimate heir to the empire, a child under the guard of legion captain Lucius.
Jackie has a more serious role, but Dragon Blade still has fantastic action choreography. Adding to that a good script and a brutal performance by Adrian Brody. (what a great actor, all the roles he plays whatever te movie is well done. he is the male version of Meryl Streep). And it is already known, the better the ""villain"" the better the movie.I recommend it, especially to those who like epic movies, is very good."
" Grandiose in a good way
",0.4404,-0.0111,2021-01-29 00:00:00,9,"Ls,
I really...really enjoyed it.
The production value is extremely high.
Magnificent costumes and fight scenes, the end battle is truly epic.
Music is, now and then, grandiose, which, if it was all a true story appropriate but it fits the scenery trying to lift it to what you are watching(had it been true)
Also, I had some voice issues probably caused by multilingual over editing.
Kid's crying was annoying.
All that is just me. So that's why a 9 not a 10.
Oh yeah, Jackie Chan being not goofy is refreshing.
Watch and enjoy."
" Underrated Movie
",0.0,0.2946,2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"It's a fantastic movie to watch, haven't seen a good movie of Jackie Chan since The Karate Kid."
" Good for watching with a group to make fun of it
",0.7351,0.875,2021-01-11 00:00:00,1,"If you love history then this is not the film for you. It's obvious the filmmakers have never so much as opened a pop up children's book on the Romans. They would have done better just by watching the movie Gladiator. Instead the Romans fight differently than real Romans did, they have names like ""black eagle corps"" that is not Roman, even their costumes are wrong. Conversely this film is obviously a Chinese film because they come out smelling like roses. This feels like a puff piece. Don't get me wrong, the Romans weren't saints and there are a slew of American films that are guilty of this same treatment. This could have been better, alot better, if the filmmakers would have put forth any sort of effort at casting, historical research, storyline, anything. This is a joke."
" Pretty much a confusing mish mash.
",0.3182,0.4939,2020-12-03 00:00:00,4,"Disjointed, but good ish action scenes. Jumps about too much . It's a couple of hours I'll never see again. But hey ho, guess I've seen worse.........
somewhere."
" Only for Jackie's Hard-Core Fans
",0.0,0.9927,2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"The story in the movie is a complete mess. I'm not going to go into details, but if you are considering watching this movie, you must have already accepted that legions of Romans in China is OK. It would be more plausible if they shifted the accent a bit more into fantasy (e.g. different kingdoms, one is more like Roman Empire and another like China, but not actual countries), so there are not so many complaints about historical inaccuracies, but it is what is and according to them, it's based on historical facts. There are also a bit too many secondary undeveloped characters.So, as the title says, you would enjoy it if you just watch it for Jackie. The sword fights are pretty good; other fights, well some are not bad, some are meh. I watched it to the end, skipped only a few times, overall not his worst movie, but far from his best one.Summary: Recommended only for true Jackie Chan's fans."
" Fücking Lionsgate!!!
",0.0,0.2444,2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,Fück Lionsgate! Thanks for blowing out my damn ear drums with your title card screen! Geezus! But I guess the movie was watchable eh
" A Decent Film
",0.0,0.9918,2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I think that this was a surprisingly good movie, you can see there has been a lot of work within it.
For everyone that says that they hinted the people's harmony too much, one of the main morals of the movie is that people, Eventho we differ in appearance or race are able to live with each other instead of against each other. Throw yourselves in the shoes of the characters, you fought, built, slept, laughed with each other for months and then some foreign invader comes to attack those who are dear to you, would you not have acted the same? In my opinion yes I would.Another great thing was the amount of fighting choreography was needed to pull off this movie. The fight between Lucius and Huo an was amazing scenery just like all the other duels and little number fights. The armor had effect and was played with nicely, although my only two points with this were: The amount of Wounds and The Hawks. Huo an took a considerable amount of wounds per example the spear wound in his stomach area, which he received early final battle. The Hawks that came in for the safe was pretty cliche and didn't look good at all.Now onto the humor, I found the humor pretty decent. You like it or hate in, I found the captain and his assistant a decent comedic relieve. It's definitely not the best humor but again this movie isn't aimed at comedy.The Music was absolutely amazing, they timed it well with the scenes and didn't overuse the most important soundtrack/song ""Light of Rome"" which was absolutely beautiful.
The rest of the story/plot. Well here is the thing that really brought it down for me, the child emperor and his ""guardian"" were almost useless in the movie, the suicide of Tiberius was pretty ludicrous as well considering he was this sort of mad man for the entire movie and changed minds late movie, sounds pretty ridiculous. The Flashbacks were really short and didn't have much info on them but it gave enough info for a decent vision of what had happened. Some things are pretty over the top but then again it's already a movie that's not trying to be historically accurate so fantasy elements like a stone on shield with spears is slightly excused.Overall I think this was a pretty decent movie and I give it a 7/10"

In the wake of some really good Asian action movies such as Hidden Dragon,Crouching Tiger , there have been some other very good movies , alas also some very bad ones , and this one is situated in the last categorie. All emphesis on trying to be epic , scenery , but falling down on stupid music-scores all over the place and nottin original and poor storyline. Don't watch this , it will only tire your eyes."
" Appalling.
",-0.3612,-0.6124,2019-09-10 00:00:00,2,"Terrible script, poorly directed. The odd attempt at including Jackie Chan's slapstick humour such as accidentally grasping a woman's breasts really fell flat and were out of place in what was meant to be a serious film. John Cusack was miscast and his acting showed it."
" Jackie Chan and John Cusack team up to defeat the evil Adrien Brody ...nuff said.
",-0.8126,0.8216,2019-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Dragon Blade is a fun, undemanding historical epic based upon a true story. The true story is that there was a Roman Empire, China exists and there was a Silk Road. Beyond that the film is an historical fantasy based around a Roman General on the run with the blind son of a consul and a few loyal men. He meets the disgraced Captain of a border patrol and together they..... well the plot really isn't important.
Basically Jackie Chan joins forces with John Cusack to defeat the evil Adrien Brody. There are lots of set pieces, good stunt work and some fun battles. Jackie Chan is funny, heroic and dependable as always in the lead role. Adrien Brody is suitably villainous and John Cusack plays John Cusack. It's not something worth going out of your way to watch but if it's on, Dragon Blade is a fun bit of mindless entertainment."
" Good premise, badly executed.
",-0.0516,0.3377,2019-08-11 00:00:00,2,"As with any Jackie Chan film there are some great action scenes but the quality of acting in between is diabolical. Really interesting story idea, it's just a shame it didn't live up to it."
" my notes
",0.0,0.9042,2019-07-22 00:00:00,1,"I barely lasted ten minutes. it felt super FOB-y. i skipped through to see if any action was decent but gave up after i saw 60 year old jackie chan try to do some fight scenes. getting old scares me. he used to be a beast. i also saw a scene where jackie is singing in front of a crowd for at least a few minutes. the song was kinda catchy but still. and there were some random moments i came across where the audio dubbing made me laugh, sounding like it's definitely not coming from that person, or just clearly being off.

" Gladiator meets Hero
",0.5574,0.9781,2019-06-17 00:00:00,4,"The visuals were sometimes impressive but the story was confusing and the acting was not believable.I couldn't figure out why the child needed to be in the movie. He wasn't a believable character. Maybe a plot device. Maybe he was a metaphor for Lucius' conscience. Not sure.I can't speak to the fight scenes as I'm not any authority on these. However, compared to other action movies with Jackie Chan they seemed contrived. Maybe it was John Cusack's sword skills as illustrated in the trivia section.I was really hoping for more of the ""based on actual events"" part. I don't recall Tiberius ever traveling to China but I could be wrong. I would think a movie produced on actual events, even loosely, would have some basis on historical fact. I think this movie makes this claim much like Blair Witch Project does.It seems as if the writer and/or director lifted the plots from both Gladiator and Hero and tried some sort of alchemist's nightmare to make this movie work. Both movies by themselves are great. Together they ain't Reeses Cups. Two great things didn't make one great thing together.If you are a Jackie Chan/John Cusack/Adrien Brody fan this movie might be worth trying to sit through. But your patience will be tested so keep the remote far away and your eyes propped open with toothpicks."
" East meets West on the Silk Road in this hyperactive action/adventure
",0.0,0.95,2019-04-27 00:00:00,5,"In 48 BC, a peace-promoting protection squad on the Silk Road in Northwestern China is assigned to construction work at Wild Geese Gate wherein they are assisted by a fugitive legion of Romans led by General Lucius (John Cusack), who befriends the leader of the security company (Jackie Chan). When shady Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with an army of 100,000, the other two groups team-up against them.Supposedly inspired by real-life events, ""Dragon Blade"" (2015) is a Chinese action/adventure that cost $65 million and looks it. The film is top-of-the-line as far as production quality goes (score, cast, costumes, sets, quick editing, locations, etc.). Chan is entertaining as usual while Cusack and Brody surprisingly tower in their roles (I say ""surprisingly"" because I wouldn't have imagined them cutting it as Roman commanders in the ancient past). The tone is serious with goofy quick-edited action and a modest amount of humor that's actually funny.If you happened upon any 2-3 minutes of this film you'd automatically think that it was a very worthy adventure flick. Unfortunately, it's too manic for its own good. I tried to adapt to its hyper tone and did so until just past the halfway mark when the overkill action style pretty much lost me. I endured to the end, but it was difficult. It seriously needed to slow down and cultivate depth (but at least it tries to at times).""Dragon Blade"" lacks the confident poise of the excellent ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) and instead shoots for overKILL. Consider the frenzied pace of the 2011 version of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but up the ante a couple of notches. That's this movie.The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Hengdian and Dunhuang, China, as well as the Gobi Desert.GRADE: C"
" Waste of tallent
",-0.4215,-0.197,2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"I know this is a fiction story. HOWEVER, it is set in certain historical period and what ticks me off about it the most, besides appalling storyline, script and acting was a complete and utter disregard for at least an attempt at historical accuracy when it comes to Roman soldiers.Seriously, the money they spent in this liberal artistic vision of their ""costumes"" could go into making them at least a bit historically accurate and they would look way cooler than the manure the costume department came up with."
" please respect history.
",0.6597,-0.0644,2019-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Even Hong Kong movies should not so vilify the history of the Han Dynasty. Wanton confusion of national boundaries, using the concept of silk road to deceive censorship. Huo Qubing mainly fought against Hun, the battlefield was in Mongolian grassland, and had nothing to do with the Western Regions. The Western Regions under the jurisdiction of the Han Dynasty began with Zhang Qian, which is totally not reflected in this film. There are Yanmen Pass. In the concept of Hong Kong people, Yanmen Pass is the Western Regions. Laugh cry. Not to mention the gibberish of the Roman army in this film, not to see how much supplies are needed from the Mediterranean to Xinjiang, but also to understand the proportion of military supplies depletion. The structure of the film is stereotyped, the logic defect is numerous, and the identification of supporting roles is too low. Finally, when propagating ideology, please respect history."
" Terrible movie
",-0.4767,-0.2263,2018-09-07 00:00:00,1,Cant believe i sat thru the whole movie. I knew i should have stopped watching the movie when i seen the sub titles at the begining. Lots of Jackie Chan dancing if your into that.
" Really hard to decide on worst actor in this one
",-0.6997,-0.7666,2018-06-16 00:00:00,1,"I would put my money on Cusack with a strong contender in Brody (most likely his worst screen play performance ever).The film kicks off on a note of ""based on a true story"" in other words ""watch out crap ahead"".After a brief BMW commercial for the Chinese market the inevitable takes place.
Zero to none effort was made to make the film even remotely accurate - at least they could have tried to get armoury and stuff right.While watching you will ask yourself ""do they really mean that?"" - apparently they do. Otherwise there is now explanation for the bad ""storyline"" (there is no story anyway).Even the fight scenes are lacking enthusiasm. Please don't hurt your eyes with this one - bad enough I watched it to the end, which I only did to confirm that this is in fact the worst film I have ever seen."
" This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.5775,2018-06-11 00:00:00,2,"I was expecting an entertaining movie and that it was, only not in a way that ticked all the right boxes. The story has an aluring basis, Roman legion meets the Chinese army on the silk road. The way they take liberties with history is appaling. Crossbows? angelical choires? Chinese and Romans effortlessly talking? It is one big mash-up, insulting to the viewer. Glad I saw it online and didn't spend Euro's on a ticket"
" ANYWAY NO FIGHT
",-0.5859,-0.9593,2018-05-22 00:00:00,4,"The first 30 minutes of this two hour film builds up the character of Huo An (Jackie Chan) the leader of the protection squad of the Silk Road in ancient times. About 30 minutes later we get introduced to our second major character, General Lucius (John Cusack) and for the next 30 minutes they unite to fortify a city and practice their fighting skills, because all the fighting in the first thirty minutes was just Asians. Then after an hour we have the Battle for Mordor against Tiberius (Adrien Brody) an ominous figure.The film is a ""could of"" happened type pseudo-history. I found the plot to be bogged down and the fight sequences ridiculously long and plentiful. Now I will admit they spent money on sets and costumes but kept the dialogue exceeding dry. The Romans native tongue was Latin, and the Chinese spoke Chinese and everyone spoke English, with Huo An speaking broken English...why?The film is a fight film for tweens and teens, particularly those who like martial arts and war films.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Horribly miscast, badly acted, poorly directed, what a waste of an interesting concept
",-0.765,-0.8152,2018-04-19 00:00:00,2,"Where to start? Jackie Chan just can't carry the lead role here - he entirely lacks the stature in every sense. John Cusack as a Roman General - whose idea was that? Because it really, really doesn't work. Neither character is remotely credible from start to finish. The chemistry between these two leads is entirely unconvincing, as much because the character development is so poor, and the dialogue and acting hopelessly wooden. A potentially interesting story badly told. Adrien Brody, though, makes a great villain."
" Epic story, crossroad clash and brotherhood
",0.0,0.1406,2018-04-14 00:00:00,6,"The evil Tiberius wants it all and plot murders and betrayals. However, even ennemy armies can love and conquer to end in peace. Amen.

" Wow that was bad
",0.0772,0.2265,2017-11-03 00:00:00,1,How do people get funding for things like this. I just kept hoping it wold get better but to no avail. Was it meant to be this bad? Is this the style in China? I can expect this from Jackie but John should have know better. Was he hard up for money? Don't waste you time. I'll never get those two hours of my life back.
" Silly but Admirable
",0.714,0.9788,2017-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Every language has it's own rhythm, it's on cadence and it's own sound. The way a language is used affects the way it's community view and express how they perceived their world. Mixing two languages, two cultures, in a film is often a tricky thing, as it needs to successfully communicate to two separate kinds of audience who have differing expectations of what movies should be. Dragon Blade is a silly but admirable attempt at trying to marry English, or rather American, with Chinese cinematic sensibilities. Where it succeeds, is the action. The choreography is solid even if Jackie Chan's age is showing. And it helps that they use a double for John Cusack, as he doesn't have the physicality of an martial action star. The premise of the story had a lot of promise, but it was drowned by the transparently lame attempt at virtue signaling diversity and equality, when it would have made the movie much more interesting if it was approached with cynicism and realism. Politics is about power play and to have a Game of Thrones type power play would have been a more satisfying film. Instead, there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that made the movie feel even longer than it's 2 hour length. The writing was also poor, as it uses expositions and monologue to further the story; a tool often used by Hong Kong and Chinese film industry. The acting is mediocre at best and some of the actors - on both sides - were annoying, but bearable. Amazingly, John Cusack was less annoying than usual. Adrien Brody was alright, Jackie Chan was himself and everyone else was forgettable. Still, it was a fun watch."
" big muddle and big battles
",-0.3818,-0.7003,2017-09-11 00:00:00,4,"Inspired by the story of a roman legion which vanished attacking the Parthian empire in 50 BC, this is a tale of civilizations clashing on the silk road. Huo An (Jackie Chan) leads the Silk Road Protection Squad which tries to keep the peace among the warring factions. They are framed for gold smuggling and sentenced to prison work detail at the Wild Geese Gate. Lucius (John Cusack) leads his Legion to the gate with a blind boy named Publius. They are on the run from Publius' murderous brother Tiberius (Adrien Brody).There continues to be an effort to sell Chinese movies by adding Hollywood elements. This has led to bending and twisting stories to accommodate the additions. The stories feel artificial and manufactured. It's a mess of clunky muddle. There are some nice battle scenes in this one. They are wild fun action but this movie is immediately forgettable."
" Just could not watch it
",0.0,0.671,2017-08-25 00:00:00,2,"I'm sure the story line was good, and based on other reviews it's about a time in the history of the Silk Road. I would actually enjoy a historical drama and usually love anything Jackie Chan does... but the script was so forced and bad, just can think of better word. Both Jackie Chan and John Cusack are good actors but this was a horrible train wreck and I could not continue watching... I even tried a 2nd time when it was on again. I hope Jackie makes more historical movies but hope he gets better writers."
" Huo An, the protector of the Silk Road has defend China against the mighty Roman Empire
",0.0,0.9703,2017-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Surprisingly good due to Adrien Brody's standout performance as a villain, and the great fight scenes. The first part of the movie was a bit long and focused on Jackie Chan's Huo An bonding with John Cusack's character. The second part, when Adrien Brody makes an appearance is where the pace picks up, and things get more exciting. John Cusack is undoubtedly a great actor, but the real scene-stealer is Adrien Brody. He exudes evil, but portrays his character with depth. It is not easy to command screen in the presence of a legend like Jackie Chan, but Brody does that easily and you can believe that he could go toe to toe on a fight with Jackie Chan. Though there is a lot of CGI in the scenery, the fights were realistic and grounded. Another great thing that Hollywood could learn from is how this movie handles diversity. Cusack and Brody are allowed to shine while the top-billed Chan gets to do what he does best, the action. The prelude and epilogue of the story, though not connected to the main plot actually provides a good wrapping to the movie. However, Chan's attempt to insert comedy in his action seems a little stale and out of place. All in all, a brilliant action movie in its own right, and a must see for Jackie Chan fans."
" Overlong, boring and with little consistence
",-0.3182,-0.9523,2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,"It has to be said that I saw the cut version, not the over two hours one. I wonder if the longer version makes more sense or gives the characters more meat, but the cut one, clocking at around one hour forty minutes is a boring mess.Jackie Chan plays Huo An, a man that has fallen from grace and has to work with his men in the reconstruction of a fortress. There arrives John Cusack's Lucius, a Roman on the run from Tiberius, a bad bad one. Cue Lucius and Huo An bonding, Tiberius making an appearance and lots of fights happening.The plot is basically non-existent. You have something about Huo An wanting peace but being betrayed, Lucius trying to be a good man and protect a child and Tiberius being bad and selfish. And just that. You then have lots of fights, way too many. When the big one starts you will probably have already turn off your attention. And if not, the long running time of it, with the seen a hundred times twists and developments will.It doesn't help that the fights are not particularly well choreographed or engaging and that the acting is subpar. Cusack out-acts almost everyone around him (even if he looks as if he just walked into the wrong set and decided to stay because he was bored). Chan's character lacks gravitas and giving him a wife or some children to protect don't make him more relatable. And Tiberius, played by Adrien Brody with extra of ham and cheese, belongs to a school play.All in all, the movie just lacks in all departments. If you are ironing some clothes it may be good enough as background entertainment. But don't expect much more."

",-0.3612,0.9283,2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"So if you watched this movie it is obviously bad in a lot of ways, that's why I'm not going to get into why and what in particular was so bad about it. I don't feel like it's even worth it, so I am going to just concentrate on the good. First of all, the costumes,flags and other set pieces kind of impressed me with the creativity behind them and somewhat good concise detail to them. I was half expecting it to all look like flimsy crap up close the way the movie was going. Secondly, the acting between Cusack and Jackie Chan was actually pretty believable with crappie screen writing they seemed to be given. Their chemistry was good as well. Thirdly, uhhhh I got nothing else, for now at least. If you still want to watch this movie I recommend fast forwarding through most of it.On another matter Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is one of the best Star Wars films and it needs help in the ratings so go help it out, please!!"

",0.7579,-0.9673,2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"This film is terrible, from the painfully fake wigs to the creepy yet hilarious blind child,I cannot see what they spent the budget on! (Probably on the three main actors and 2304k cameras so we can see every single pore in Cousaks face).The story starts off with a cheesy fight between some odd looking Mongol barbarian types and some Hindu looking people. Jackie Chan jumps into the mix but fails to deliver his usually hilarious performance.Later on he gets arrested and sent to work as slave labour and a few seconds later he's back in control of the city and the man who apparently hated him is now cheering.A Roman legion (With advanced building skills) some how thinks it's clever to charge a fortified city while on horseback! Jackie Chan who's no longer a laborer greets him and lets in the army that was seconds ago trying to invade.They become friends and fix a wall by using tons and tons of metal which would probably have taken a lot longer to collect, melt hammer and bolt into place. Anyways we find out there's a creepy blind kid who is obviously Chinese but some how got cast as a Roman emperor wearing a blonde wig, he can sing Latin even though everyone speaks English. oh by the way he sings what sounds like medieval Latin, not Roman Latin.Anyways I digress, the bad guy (Tiberius, a roman consul or something) arrives and simply walks in through the fortifications that the entire start of the film centered around! not even a single arrow was shot, they just waltz in! Cousak is captured and tortured and the Wigged up emperor child jumps off a cliff while he bawls his eyes out. We find out Adrian Brody (Tiberius) is just butt-hurt because Cousak fell in love with the child and not him. He proceeds to breathe vigorously for the rest of the scene. Somewhere in there we have a flashback of Jackie Strangling his sister and killing her, then flash back to the present.....At this point I quit and turned it off."
