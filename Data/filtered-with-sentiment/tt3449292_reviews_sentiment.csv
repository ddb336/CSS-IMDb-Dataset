" A must watch true story movie
",0.4215,0.6486,2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,Appreciate Nawazuddin's acting. This movie will touch your heart and motivate your soul.
" Inspirational Movie
",0.5106,0.3215,2020-09-30 00:00:00,8,"A truly awe-inspiring tale of a man's iron-will. The humble, vulnerable and impoverished character of Dashrat Manjhi's epic portrayal by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. A tragic love story which is woven into the fabric of poverty, evils of caste system and political brinkmanship. It keeps the audiences gripped with good comedy, action, thrills, romance. adventure, horror, fantasy and historic Biopic. Well edited no prolonged cut scenes, or unnecessary songs. Evolves into a streamlined fast paced bitter sweet movie for all to watch. There is no task bigger than breaking a mountain, so if he can so can you !!! The message is clear .... In-spite of the struggles, a man's vision to foresee a future when others disowned him shunned him as insane. Still achieves his lifetime of work in a monumental story of struggle although not beautiful, or carved out of marble like the ""Taj Mahal"", his work should be honoured and declared a wonder of this world. Its a classic. Rush to the cinemas near to u not for enjoying 2 hours of good show, but to learn and change your life from his."
" Ketan Mehta back in form.
",0.0,0.9101,2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Manjhi : The Mountain Man review :With 'Manjhi', Director Ketan Mehta completes his hat-trick of biopics starting with 'Mangal Pandey - The Rising' (2005) and last year's 'Rang Rasiya' (on painter Raja Ravi Varma). The good news is that 'Manjhi' is better of the three and most of the credit goes to one person - Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays the titular character.Presented in non linear format which works given the simplistic (though inspiring) core of this true story, the film also delves in to the pathetic conditions existing in Gehlore village in Bihar in the 60s where abject poverty compelled the lower caste community (to which Dashrath Manjhi belonged) to feed on dead rats and the atrocities committed on them by the local landlord included nailing horseshoe on to their soles and randomly abducting their women. Between all this mayhem, Dashrath Manjhi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) finds true love in Phagunia (Radhika Apte) and they live a happy (and rather potent!) family life until tragedy strikes when Phagunia falls off the nearby mountain.Dashrath holds this mountain responsible for his wife's death as it was the reason he couldn't reach the neighbouring village clinic on time. Conversing with the mountain as one would with his sworn enemy, Dashrath starts breaking the mountain with a hammer and chisel...and continues his work relentlessly for 22 long years.Of the cast, Nawazuddin Siddiqui is extraordinary as the Mountain Man. His transformation from a young innocent lover to an aging and almost demented person is to be seen to be believed. Radhika Apte has a small role but still makes an impression. Tigmanshu Dhulia as the Thakur carries forward his character from the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' (2012). The pretty Deepa Sahi plays Indira Gandhi with a prosthetic nose.Ketan Mehta gives you lot of moments to take home and ponder upon...like the village which doesn't change much over three decades even though untouchability and the evil Zamindari system is long abolished. Ex - landlords merely turn in to corrupt politicians to continue exploiting the down trodden.... It's a well brought out social comment that rural India hasn't really changed for the better yet...Manjhi getting duped in to acknowledging receipt of a Government grant which never reaches its intended purpose exposes the universality of corruption which escapes no one. Manjhi's unsuccessful trip to New Delhi to meet the then Prime minister Indira Gandhi is also interestingly captured.On the flip side, a few crucial aspects are ignored like Manjhi's relationship with his kids. The scene where he falls in to the mountain crevice and later chops off his own body part to survive has a Danny Boyle's '127 hours' (2010) hangover.Still, I would recommend Manjhi. It works better in parts than as a whole. And of course, Nawazuddin nails it!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni"
" One of the besf Movie
",0.0,0.6249,2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,This movie should go for oscar. Dont have words which can express the excellence of acting of nawazudinn
" Amazing!!!
",0.6884,0.9522,2019-06-23 00:00:00,9,Would've given a 10 if not for those unnecessary songs. Other than that this is a masterpiece! If you're looking for inspiration this is a must watch! Acting is of supreme quality. Hats off Nawaz! Great dialogues. The songs make it an unnecessarily long movie.
" That is a movie
",0.0,0.9606,2019-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Yes, the movie with an excellent and extraordinary story, a story of inspiration, a story of real life. Manjhi did an impossible job, did because of love. Nawazuddin Siddiqui acting was really great in that movie."
" The direction spoiled it all
",0.0,0.5318,2019-02-18 00:00:00,4,It could be a legendary movie if it had done well with the direction. I felt very bad at the finishing of the movie. The director couldnt convey the real feeling of this epic story. They spoiled this beautiful story entirely
" The Indian Shawshank Redemption
",0.0,0.8591,2018-08-13 00:00:00,10,Just like the Shawshank Redemption this movie shows you the power of perseverance and love. Nawazuddin is one of the finest actor Indian film industry ever produced. Lucky to see this movie.
" Poor justice to a remarkable achievement
",0.5994,0.7582,2018-06-28 00:00:00,1,"The movie started off solid in a serious tone. But then 20 minutes in I gave up. Just couldn't stand the drivel.Why do Bollywood movie makers feel that they need to inject sappy love story, stupid comical 'reliefs' and cheesy romantic songy vibes to make a movie sellable?Have some respect for your work instead of kowtowing to please the hoi polloi. This is why movies from India never wins Oscar."
" Good idea bad director..
",-0.1531,-0.8065,2018-04-02 00:00:00,3,"I m watching Bollywood movies to understand Hindi language and find out similar words with my language. So that reason i have to watch so many movies. I like the idea of movie but didnt like it script, dialoque and directors job. Some of the acting isnt good tooo much acting makes fake its not natural. i wish they showed more paralel political and social statu changing in India same time."
" The living example for Andy Dufresne's tunnel
",0.0,0.8014,2017-10-02 00:00:00,10,"A man broke down a hillock into pieces with just a hammer and a chisel in 21 years. He was the Mountain Man of India- Dashrath Manjhi. Its disheartening that he never got his due and his family could never come out of poverty. The state government barely did anything to promote him. Nawazuddin Siddiqui has portrayed the character beautifully, but over dramatization at instances steals the charm from the film. It could have been even more shorter and even more solid. However despite clichÃ©s, it manages to deliver the what it promised. I would have given it 8/10. But those two extra points are for the man who inspired the movie."
" Rare good Hindi movie
",0.4404,0.9531,2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Good Hindi movie is rare. It's one of the rare ones. Actually in bollywood where movies are made, such that after watching those you would feel you just wasted your 2.5 hours, if u are a real good movie lover. From that point of view it's a great movie. It's not typical bollywood movie which are nothing movie. Recently bollywood actually making some good bilographical movies. Though in this movie too like them, there are a little (not much to bother) bollywoody things like unnecessarily focusing & driving plot by emmotion anyway but this movie is worth watching specially such great acting by nawazuddin siddique.."
" Misjudged and surprisingly unmoving
",0.296,0.8834,2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"This story had all the right ingredients to make an engrossing, moving, spiritual tale of how a man, driven by the loss of his wife stands against the system, the government and the world in order to literally face a mountain and beat it.The real life story is truly inspirational and it is a shame that the movie we get here is disjointed, tonally all over the place and excessively melodramatic. Ketan Mehta seems to have fallen in love with the love story so much that it dominates the whole fabric of the movie. The first half seems to be devoted to this overtly bollywoodish love story which seems jarringly out of place and moreover the motivation of the main character over the course of the movie moves from being love lost to some bollywood version of obsession - this is what hurts the movie the most.His mental state, his fight with the elements- both internal and external and his quest for justice and equality to the villagers in the form if the road seems to get lost. The director throws in topical political and social issues like caste system in Bihar, oppression by landlords, child marriages, emergency in India, rich poor divide but he is not able to follow through on these and connect it with the ongoing narrative. They seem like afterthoughts mostly.The emotional power of the film is only because of the acting of Nawazuddin which is just exemplary. Even when the film fails around him, he is able to make us feel the earnestness, desperation and resolve of Manjhi - The Mountain Man.This story deserved a better film."
" One of best Bollywood Movie both in terms of storyline and acting.
",0.6369,0.9812,2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"India where Bollywood is center of Hindi movie industry it is very difficult to see a movie with a blend of a good story line actors who really play the role as if its actually his real life. Manjhi is based on true story where nawaz portrays the character of Dasharath manjhi, we knew that a person called manjhi has cut down a mountain to pay a way between 2 cities so that no one will face the problem which his wife had faced through. But know one knew what struggle he had gone though to complete this huge task. This movie beautifully portrays the story which will leave you overwhelmed. Radhika apte also plays a strong character of a beautiful wife and has given her above par performance. Director Ketan Mehta has given anything he could to make this biography come to life. and one of the important thing not to miss apart from performance are the dialogues, Dialogues are best part of the movie which will leave you mesmerized. Over all Manjhi is a must watch."
