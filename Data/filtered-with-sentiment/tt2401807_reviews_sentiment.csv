" First Half Was BAD A$$!!!
",-0.7277,0.951,2021-01-15 00:00:00,5,"I loved the first half of this movie, I loved it so much I would often rewind it and watch it ! The second half is when it got too many twists, everybody got careless and the whole thing went to hell! I don't know about you but if somebody kidnaps my daughter me and my crew are retaliating on who we think did it, I would be on my guard 24/7 Nicolas Cage and he's two cronies are going around kicking ass and taking names, then they let their guard down knowing those that you retaliate against are coming for you, also when I didn't like these, fools are going around in broad daylight shooting and beating up the bad guys in a RUSSIAN MOB! Seriously? I found that very careless and very silly, but again the first half was great and the twist was awesome! I don't want to ruin it for those who wish to see it. It was free on Amazon Prime so I didn't pay for it I would have been pissed if I had! I watch movies like many to be entertained, so the movie doesn't have to always be perfect but it would be nice if it made sense! The first half made sense...The second half GTFO."
" Cage Brings the Cage!!
",0.0,0.5959,2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,"Say what you will about this film. Cage always brings it. A or B he doesnt phone it in like some might (BW)....What you need to know. A bit slow in parts. Glover's salary just took away valuable cash from the budget. The story was believable and ties up in the end. For the haters....., not all movies end with rainbows and puppy dogs. Cage makes you feel the characters pain. I would watch it again. Oh... I almost forgot the RAV 4 get away car!!! RAV vs Mustang. Guess who wins!!! Not a great chase scene."

The wife and daughter and some other women appearing are such bad actresses that I'm shocked. And again, giving an old guy a hot and young chick as a wife who is younger than his daughter, I mean, come on. Plus the ending! All in all, bad. Very bad."
" A JOKE! LIKE A HOMEMADE VIDEO PRODUCTION
",0.6114,-0.2503,2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,I can't believe Cage would agree to be on such Movie. This is so bad that even cage couldnt act. Gave it a 5 for out of respect. I do not recommend.

" Amateur rage from Cage
",-0.5574,-0.8946,2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"This is really just a way too convoluted tale about a reformed criminal (Cage) who goes out to dinner one night with his wife leaving his teenage daughter with friends at home. Whilst out, he is advised by the police that there has been a break in at his home and that daughter ""Caitlin"" has been kidnapped. Soon afterwards, she is discovered dead and he believes that this is the work of the Russian mafia with whom he and his two friends (Max Ryan & Michael McGrady) engage in some fairly brutal revenge antics. There are a couple of really distracting sub-plots which do rob the overall film of pace, and Cage is not at all convincing when the rather over-the-top violence kicks in. Danny Glover shows up now and again, but to no real purpose and the rest of the cast add nothing accept as fodder for the beatings. Maybe would have been a better proposition for Jason Statham?"
" Cage rages in Rage
",-0.7717,0.9473,2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Cage goes over the top with vengeful emotion in this crime thriller with Russian mobsters. If that sounds like your bag, you might enjoy this Saturday night action flick. It's really fun to see Cage go all out in brutal action sequences. It takes a little while for Cage to tap into his high octane glory as a madman that won't let anything stand in his way, but the wait is well worth it. Cage with any weapon is immediately fun to see. The story is mediocre and familiar with a twist and ending sprinkled with laughable dialogue that's warranted with most Cage movies. I'm not one for action movies, but with Cage, it's always fun action!"

I recommend this movie if you like action movie, Nicholas Cage, and you don't get upset by watching violence, blood and other. If you don't like anything of that, don't watch this movie then, it's not for you and you would give a very low score that it doesn't deserve.
Could it be better? Of course, everything can be better even when it looks like perfect.
Watch the movie and then decide whether it was worth of your time.
In my case it was, nothing to regret."

A fathers revenge against Eastern Block, one dimensional baddies, is not exactly fresh but again there is enough here to keeping it ticking along (nicely). Also contains a thumping musical score, which certainly adds to the proceedings. In case you don't know a 'Tokarev' is a side-arm (or piece), favoured by the 'Old Skool' Russian Mafia."
" decent nick cage thriller
",0.1027,-0.7672,2019-10-19 00:00:00,8,"First off I'm a NICHOLAS CAGE fan, and I was sad to see that this film lost money at the box office. I'm writing a review in 2019 after obtaining a dvd of RAGE. I dismissed the movie at first viewing as shlock however on repeated viewings I came to appreciate some of the action scenes also some emotional performances. The underlying story became better understood and I realized it made the movie more than average. I now consider it 8/10 with a caveat .Consider the story the acting the directing and ignore some of the dialogue and some of the weak scenes it contains."
" Uhmm, no...
",0.0,0.8679,2019-10-03 00:00:00,3,"The last good movie Nicolas Cage made, was 'Knowing' in 2009 (although 'Season of the Witch' in 2011 also wasn't too bad). I enjoy Cage, though, and like to give him the benefit of the doubt, hence decided to watch 'Tokarev' despite negative reviews.I hate to say, I agree with the reviews. The film doesn't start off too bad and got my attention. As the film progressed, though, it became rather weird - as did Cage's acting (which seems to the the norm as of late). There are way too many credibility issues here. I completely understand Paul Maguire (Cage)'s character development - from a 'clean', ordinary guy, to a man filled with vengeance and hate. I enjoyed that aspect of the film.The film then dishes up more back stories than it can handle and starts falling apart, until it completely crashes with the twist ending, which rendered most of the movie (if not the entire film) pointless..."
" Pretty Bad.
",-0.0772,0.7202,2019-09-03 00:00:00,4,"I really, really, really wanted to start this review by saying Nic Cage's Rage is full of Cage rage, but I can't... mostly because this movie is incredibly boring for the first hour and then it finally starts to pick up. Since we've started our ongoing Nic Cage Series, I've seen quite a few shades of Cage; he has his great films where he clearly cares (""Leaving Las Vegas""), he has his ridiculous films where he still cares (""Face/Off""), he has his middling films where he gives middling, but sometimes funny performances (""Army of One""), he has his terrible films where he oftentimes looks as if he could care less about what's happening (""Season of the Witch""), but this film is something else... in many scenes it looks as if Cage is horribly bitter about being in this movie at all. There are scenes when I honestly wondered if Cage was a bit intoxicated as he stood there, bleary-eyed and mumbling, sometimes giving a far worse performance than many of the actors whose names I'd never heard of. Other than two or three scenes, Cage looked completely miserable in front of the camera, and for good reason: this movie is pretty darn awful."

In an attempt to find the killer the retired Pauli and two friends turn the town upside down, causing havoc to the Russian mafia.Danny Glover has a small role as the policeman investigating the case. Rachel Nichols plays the part of his young second wife who loves the daughter as her own.The location appears to be a small city, one where you wouldn't expect such a heavy influence of Russian mafia. There are numerous flashbacks to an event they believe is somehow connected to the present. The film had scenes that worked well, but the overall plot felt uneven, with an ending that made me feel I wasted my time watching the film.Will have camp value second time through knowing the ending."
" A certain blandness
",0.2732,-0.4939,2019-02-07 00:00:00,4,"TOKAREV is a typical crime thriller with a few good ideas and concepts lost amid a listless screenplay and a whole lot of cliches designed to bore the most patient of viewers. Nicolas Cage, in one of his more restrained performances, plays a father and family man whose teenage daughter is kidnapped. It turns out that our protagonist has a prior career as a gangster, so he wages a war on the Russian mob in retaliation. The film features extremely obvious twists and routine action sequences, but the characters are bland and the whole thing rather forgettable."
" A violent and twisted film about a relentless vengeance , professionally directed by Spanish filmmaker Paco Cabezas
",-0.5719,-0.9915,2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"When the daughter of a reformed criminal (Nicolas Cage happily married to Rachel Nichols ) is abducted , he rounds up his old team (Max Ryan , Michael McGrady) and attempts to solve the kidnap , at the same time he seeks vendetta against the kidnappers . As he and his crew face off criminal bosses and henchmen employing drastic tortures and pains including crude punishment , physical abuse , panic attack and brutal violence . The past never stays dead.
This is a thrilling and bleak film with high doses of suspense , intrigue , plot twists , blood , and violence . This stirring story is compellingly filmed , following a violent and dark style similar to Paco Cabezas' former successful films . And sadly showing quite a few amoral roles , corruption , badness and despicable acts of pure evil carried out by the violent protagonists as well as the ruthless contenders . While the look is suitable sinister and intriguing, the plot spreads to the surprising breaking point , including an unexpected final that turns out to be extremely stirring . There stands out Nicolas Cage giving his usual but acceptable interpretation as a relentless avenger father who broken by pain , rage and impotence attempts to seek the nasty agressors and exact a merciless vendetta by using terrible and cruel tortures . As the reformed ex-delinquent seeks his own brand of justice , as he acts as revenger judge , jury and executioner , Charles Bronson-alike . Nicolas Cage hired filmmaker Paco Cabezas , because being a huge fan of Carne de neón (2010), Paco Cabezas' second movie and the one who caught the attention of Hollywood . Here the veteran Nicolas Cage is well accompanied by a fine support cast , such as : Rachel Nichols as his wife , Max Ryan , Michael McGrady , Peter Stormare , Pasha Lychnikoff and special mention for the forgotten Danny Glover as Det. Peter St. John .
It packs an atmospheric and adequate cinematography by Andrzej Sekula , who has also shot some fims ,being filmed in Mobile, Alabama . As well as a moving and sensitive musical score by Laurent Eyquem . This decent production is a thriller/revenge competently directed by Pablo Cabezas . His first feature length Project was ¨Aparecidos¨ (2007) a terror Spanish/Argentina film . Paco is a good screen-writer such as ¨Bon Appetit¨ (2010) , ¨Spanish movie¨(2009) , ¨Sexy killer¨(2008) and a notorious filmmaker , especially known for Carne Neón (2010), , being subsequently hired by Hollywood/Nicolas Cage , where directed Tokarev (2014) . Furthermore , he is filmmaking ¨Men with No Fear¨ and ¨Mr. Right¨ in post-production . And shooting some episodes of popular series as Penny Dreadful (TV Series) , Fear of walking dead , The strain , Into the badlands , among others .Rating : 6.5/10 . Acceptable and passable . The motion picture will appeal to Nicolas Cage fans and thriller buffs ."
" A Starkly Dense Dark Crime Thriller
",-0.4767,-0.961,2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"27 September 2014. This almost anti-establishment, anti-mainstream crime thriller seems to defy the traditional script set up. For much of the movie, it avoids a fast pace, quick editing, simple stereotypical good-bad guy set up. The plot unfolds in an unpredictable way, characters are not who they are usually portrayed to be, people die the audience doesn't usually expect. This is no hero-worship show.There is definitely a deliberate cerebral quality underlying the theme of this movie. The movie sets up with an overly typical, average family of upper middle class, but without the flair and extravagance often portrayed in the movies. This realism layout is almost too boring and unbelievable because of its believability reflecting real life. Unlike A History of Violence (2005), the focus of the story is on the mystery, not the idiosyncrasy of the characters and it is in the plainness that the major twist in the movie comes at the end. There is a tangible echo of the serious tone of The Cooler (2003).Except of a confusing inclusion of a motorcycle chase scene, the movie offers up a slow, thoughtful, sometimes raw and graphic brutality as well as the wrenching of human emotional struggle and suffering. Depending on what one expects from this movie, it is probably best not to have any except that this movie is about past deeds, about love, betrayal, about awful physical violence, about making assumptions. In the end, this is an experiential movie that offers up a mood, an experience, that perhaps for most of us, we are lucky to not have been given the knife."
" Hated the ending !!!
",-0.7249,0.7616,2018-09-07 00:00:00,4,"Nicholas Cage acting was fantastic in this movie, the mystery makes you go insane, he kills all of the Russians in his city, yet can't find the killer of his daughter, yet, when the movie's end approaches, you're to be surprised by the fact that the killer is NOT the Russians !!!! So why in the heck would you make a movie with such a paradoxical effect ! I felt that I've lost 2 hours of my life on a great movie with a nasty ending !"
" Pathetically pretentious
",-0.4215,0.1053,2018-08-12 00:00:00,3,"Given its mediocre quality in acting, directing and screenplay, it's not difficult to see why this movie has become an easy target to quite a few lambasting reviews. As most reviewers put it Rachel Nichols is a total miscast as the wife of Nick Cage. As for Cage, he has an honest attempt for his role if you can see past his hair style, which could sometimes be a challenge. If it were all to it I'd cut the movie a slack and accept it as a subpar guys night movie without further ado. However, the real problem is with its pathetic pretentiousness. The ringleader of a Russian gang utters a few wise sounding words and tells a brief ""heartbreaking"" story of how he got involved in this game. Suddenly, this is supposed to add a ""philosophical"" dimension and character depth to an otherwise all evil bunch. Give me a break."
" critics
",-0.296,0.4061,2018-06-15 00:00:00,5,"I'm not a critic, i just look at films to see what they are and find myself some sort of entertainment.
What i can't understand is how people that don't know anything about making films can't stand at telling they are satisfied or they find the movie bad. The reasons those criticasters give only show how little they really know about the movie making industrie, and they try to appear to be all knowing how a movie has to be in their eyes, without ever consulting the directors, producers or the actors themselves.
Is there any criticaster that ever have for real been an actor him/her selve?
Let people decide themselves what they think about story, choreography and the capabilty of the actors and makers of a movie without displaying your own complete ignorance, or proove to us, you really have an understanding of what you're writing about.
Bad or good, i enjoy the way Nicholas Cage playes his characters, and after living for 76 years now, you can't tell me otherwise."
" The die is cast
",-0.5994,0.967,2018-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Paul Maguire used to be a dangerous criminal but he has been going straight for many years... then one day his daughter is kidnapped. Either those who did it have no idea who they are messing with or his past is coming back to haunt him. Fearing the latter he gets together with a couple of friends from the old days and starts asking questions. Then her body is found with a bullet from a Soviet Tokarev pistol in her head. He had crossed paths with members of the Russian Mafia before but this time he is going to war. The body count rapidly rises but nobody will admit to knowing anything about his daughter's death.It must be admitted that this film has some obvious flaws; most notably certain details about the weapon which when revealed make one wonder why nobody thought about it earlier... it is impossible to go into too much detail about this as that would spoil the film. There is plenty of action, some of it is fairly brutal, often meted out by the 'good guys'. This action is pretty exciting and should satisfy fans of the genre. Nicolas Cage is pretty solid as Maguire even if he does get a little over the top when he confronts those he feels are responsible for his daughter's death. The rest of the cast were pretty good although I was somewhat surprised to see Danny Glover playing a police officer... wasn't he 'too old for this stuff' back in the 1980s?! Overall I'd say this is fun if you can overlook certain details."
" The Futility of Crime
",-0.5423,-0.9833,2017-12-19 00:00:00,5,"Paco Cabezas' crime thriller ""Rage"" depicts the futility of violence. The irony at the heart of this gritty, unsavory yarn is that violence doomed the life of a young, 17-year old girl. Cage is cast as Paul Maguire, a gangster-turned-legit-businessman, in Mobile, Alabama. He has been walking the straight and narrow since he gave up his life of crime. Maguire's first wife died from breast cancer, and he has married a younger woman. Maguire dotes on his only daughter, Caitlin (Aubrey Peeples), and he surprised and saddened to learn that she has been kidnapped. Mobile Police Detective Peter St. John (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") advises Maguire to stay out of the matter and let the police handle the investigation. Maguire listens to a similar lecture from his former mob boss, Francis O'Connell (Peter Stormare of ""The Big Lebowski""), to steer clear of the investigation. Maguire's grieving wife, Vanessa (Rachel Nichols of ""Charlie Wilson's War""), urges him to do whatever he must to get Caitlin back. Imagine Maguire's grief when he learns that Caitlin's body has been discovered in a drain by a jogger! The autopsy indicates that a Russian-made automatic pistol, a Tokarev, was used to snuff out Caitlin. Meanwhile, the only witnesses to Caitlin's kidnapping were two teenagers who were spending the evening with her at Maquire's residence. Once Maguire learns about the murder weapon, he believes that the Russian mob killed his daughter. Maguire and two of his old buddies arm themselves and go after the Russians with blood in their eyes. There is a last-minute surprise for both Maguire and the Russians that will stun audiences. Indeed, this surprise comes out of nowhere. ""Rage"" ties this surprise to the theme of the futility of violence. Nicolas Cage doesn't play a nice guy in this melodrama. At one point, he wields a knife on an adversary and uses it to pin the man's left hand to his back. Furthermore, our protagonist has no qualms about killing. The violence is bleak, sudden, and grueling. Nobody, least of all the protagonist, gets off easy in this splendidly lensed underworld epic. Clocking in at 98 minutes, ""Rage"" doesn't wear out its welcome, but audiences may not care for the ending."
" So bad, I'm writing this while it's playing
",-0.4576,-0.7145,2017-11-04 00:00:00,1,"I'm not sure what's worse....Cage's hair dye, the wife that looks younger than the daughter or the tired plot. I'm now just using it as background noise while I write this review. If this was the only movie available to watch, I would probably schedule a dentist appointment to have a root canal done instead of watching this again. I like many movies that Nick Cage has done, and I will watch those. When I saw Danny Glover, I was really thinking that Mel Gibson may show up. More disappointment."
" Terrible Movie
",-0.4767,-0.872,2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,"This movie was an absolute waste of 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Don't waste your time on it. Boring, drags on and on and on with very little story. Loser of a movie for Nicholas Cage. He is not aging well and needs to stay out of action movies. I use the term 'action movie' loosely in this description.Watch something better. Perhaps an old Bruce Willis movie or Conair."
" Different...
",0.0,-0.9781,2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,"After watching Tokarev, I had to read a few reviews. What you quickly realise, is that most of the 'hate' comes from viewers discovering this isn't the film they were expecting. It's something very different. I'm not going to say it was brilliant, but this film is well made, with some pretty good actors (albeit not always at their best).This isn't another 'Taken', as many seemed to expect. It plays with your expectations by setting up that kind of story, then turning it into a revenge thriller, which in turn is yet another opportunity to mess with your expectations. What you finally realise, with these morally dubious characters, is that actions have consequences. Violence begets violence. This is a morality play, a tragedy in the Greek tradition (I'm not saying it's of the same quality).This isn't another gangster movie that glorifies the cool lifestyle. Some reviewers also questioned why Danny Glover's character is there. He's the voice of reason. The voice of conscience. Nicolas Cage's character has become a 'good' person, attempting to redeem himself from his bad ways, but when something terrible occurs, this puts him to the test. Can he still be good, without the original reason he had (his daughter)? He doesn't have to return to his old ways, but his core is rotten, despite his attempts, and he cannot resist the fall. Glover's police officer is there, each step of the way, offering him the opportunity to pull back, but he can't.Rachel Nichols is very good, in a role that could have easily been disposable. She's somewhere in between. Someone who feels they could do terrible things in the name of vengeance/justice, but becomes the final victim of the fallout from Cage's violent past.So essentially, perhaps not a great film, but it's different and goes against expectations by using clichés for it's setups but not its ultimate resolution (in this type of story, anyway). As someone else said, it's probably a solid 6, but I'll give it a 7 to offset some of the negativity."
" What a disappointment for a Nicolas Cage film
",-0.5106,-0.9352,2017-08-02 00:00:00,2,"Wow. Nicolas Cage plays a racist, bigoted scum in this film, with a script full of misogynistic, racist, patriarchal macho-man bullshit. Really no fun at all to watch; of course one of the first victims of Cage's character's manhunt for the people who kidnapped his daughter is a Black man who's obviously squatting w/ his girlfriend as junkies (so original, Hollywood; esp. since most drug users are we white people). Cage's character sends his previous life's gangster friends to harass, assault, terrorize them. Super gross. Stopped watching. Enough of this happens in real life; no fun watching white nationalist jerks in movies."
