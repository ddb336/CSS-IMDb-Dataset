" Kabali is a Pa.Ranjith film filled with Rajini moments
",0.0,0.9926,2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Rajini is always seen as a larger-than-life superstar on-screen but in Pa.Ranjith's Kabali, he seems to have turned into a complete actor. Well, I feel that Kabali is the right film for Rajini the actor. After Thalapathi, he has much scope to perform rather than smashing the bad guys and attract the audience with his stylish walk and mannerisms. There are still fan moments in the film but it's much more a drama than a mass entertainer. Pa.Ranjith has utilized Rajini's acting ability and made him perform a role of his age. He even looks stylish with that grey beard which remembers me of the famous Neelambari's dialogue in Padayappa. Unlike the mass feel that the teaser created, the film is a complete drama that revolves around Kabali, a Malaysian Tamil gangster who is in search of his lost family. The film goes deep into the character exploring the emotional side of a stylish gangster. Well, it's fresh to see that Rajini has stepped out of his comfort zone to fit into a much performance-oriented role. I personally really enjoyed the scenes where we get to see him emote deeply for his loved ones. Pa. Ranjith has made a film that dives into the underworld which is very well explored in this gangster drama. Especially, after Rajini, we have so many actors to remember in Kabali. We have Radhika Apte, Dhanshika, Kishore, and Winston Chao who played their characters convincingly. Santhosh Narayanan's album and background score are the right elements to make the film connect with the audience. Pa.Ranjith's Kabali feels a bit refreshing but still has a lot of flaws that could have been avoided for the betterment of this gangster drama. The film is really slow. It takes so much time to establish the platform and the characters. Apart from Rajini's characterization, we don't have much excitement in Kabali because it feels less engaging and even less impactful. Even the climax was a bit rush and completely out of the context. The Neruppu Da theme is added in every mass scene of Rajini which is strictly for Rajini fans. Honestly speaking, Kabali can't be a film for Rajini fans because apart from the few mass moments that Ranjith added for Rajini, this is definitely not the typical mass Rajini film. Overall, Kabali is a Pa.Ranjith film filled with Rajini moments."
" Love this film

" Mayhem in Malaysia
",0.0,-0.8994,2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,"I had a chance to see Kabali only after the movie had minted over 600 crores due to lot of pending work commitments, despite the euphoria and aura surrounding its release. Frankly to put it in very simple words I was shocked in no small means on what I saw on there on the screen. I wondered while walking out of the cinema, a producer with deep pockets, A time tested veteran actor ""Willing to experiment now"" and a new age flamboyant young director along with the best of the best crew available today teamed all up to create ""This""? I had deliberately ignored all the warnings and bad reviews in the preceding days to walk up and watched ""This"" to my utter horror.The Storyline though not radically anything new or the choice of the location, Malaysia new to a Tamil cinema and it does nothing to add any flair to the ill conceived screenplay, which runs flat and leaves us cold in the first 15 minutes. Too many Characters and names which leaves the audience confused, the acting of the supporting actors in the movie who maintain a safe distance from Rajanikanth in almost every frame along with their peculiar bent spines and folded arms make matters worse. Editing was the worst of the lot, I cant believe someone got paid for this work. The plot from the beginning when the older don comes out of the prison after 25 years to find his empire and contacts intact and well oiled really tingled all the funny bones in my body. Comedy a great factor in all Rajanikanth's movies wasn't sorely missed because almost every scene was laughable like the dons waiting 25 years to take on Kabali's empire at will and gangsters killing people and rival gangsters at will, Maybe Malaysian police went on a holiday to Bangkok.With the so called storyline and a Screenplay fit only for maybe a comeback for a star like Vijaykanth or Sharath Kumar has left Rajanikanth's fan disappointing the plot is riddled with pot holes like Good don- Bad don nonsense, A Rehab school resembling a mental institution, killings across countries and getting back almost at will, Youngsters joining gangs and trading loyalties for???????, stocks of tony lee's (nothing to write about) companies crashing in minutes and the two second pool scene where Dansika floats now what the #*&^ was that!!!!!!!The only plus in the entire movie was Radhika apthe's performance when she sees her husband after 25 years which was a class apart in this cartoonish movie, Santosh Narayan's Neruppu da was fantastic but the background score was over abused to hide the overall mediocre of the movie. Though the producer wont be complaining much because of the box office results the fans were disappointed by the truckloads.
Mr. Rajanikanth. People want you to be you, people come to see your movie as it's a Rajanikant's movie filled with Songs, Comedy, Action, Romance, Drama and get their emotions kindled and to remember it for ages like say a Bashaa, Annamalai, Thalapathi, Padayappa, Arunachalam, Muthu, Shivaji and Eindiran to name a few, Though they were bad movies too, but ""Loveable"" bad movies. As fans of Rajanikanth it pained to see him in Someone else's movie than rather his......"

" A DECENT WATCH !!
",0.0,0.9926,2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"First up.. The good news.. This is a mighty leap from that lackluster Lingaa.. But, that's not much to write home about.. Is it..?Be warned..This is more a film for Rajini, the actor .. who shines through with a neat performance.And..Less from the SUPERSTAR, worshiped by the masses.Director Ranjit's movie is a mixed bag.. A movie which is neither an entertainer in the mass masala mould that the fanboys crave from the Superstar, nor in the signature style of the auteur that is rooted in the milieu and emotionally potent.It has some good bits of both worlds. Alas, in his meandering between these two worlds, the final result is less than fulfilling.The revenge drama at the center lacks sufficient bite. While some of the action sequences pack a punch, the rest are so so. This movie has more emotional content than most contemporary movies of the Superstar. Yet, most of it fail to deliver the impact, except for the bits between Rajini and Radhika Apte.One gets the feeling that this could've been so much more if the best elements from these diverse universes were to be assembled better with more coherence and finesse.Rajini, with his trademark swag, is in fine form as the aging gangster who still has the fight in him and holds some aces up his sleeves. He convincingly portrays the character's vulnerabilities and yearning for his lost family. After the disastrous Lingaa, he has made a bold choice of choosing to work with a next gen director and a character that suits his age in a story which, while not far off from the run-off-the-mill kind, has enough to showcase his acting skills.
Among the other positives are Santosh Narayanan who has delivered a great album that goes well with the movie and Radhika Apte who is once again impressive and holds her own against the Superstar.
Don't get me wrong. This IS a GOOD film. But, given the director's potential, the Superstar's magical presence and the promising glimpses from the trailer, one expected a much more heady cocktail.Nevertheless, the fact that it comes on the back of a let down called Lingaa and is promoted aggressively through a high pitched carpet bombing marketing campaign, should set the box office on fire as deprived fans lap up enough of their Superstar to satiate themselves till 2.0.Overall, it feels like a well intentioned recipe that is a tad under-cooked (perhaps, I should call it overcooked, given its length that calls for some trimming) ... a jigsaw puzzle that doesn't quite fit so well."

4) Attakathi Dinesh's actingCons:
1) EVERYTHING ELSEWhat was Ranjith thinking? What was Rajini thinking? How could the producer cheat us with the misleading trailer? This is not the Rajini that we want to see!Kabali's teaser is probably one of the best teasers to come out from Indian Cinema. It highlighted Rajini's persona, the slow-mo scenes, his BADASS Gangster look and the catchy ""Neruppu Da"" Theme. And the teaser is the main reason why the Expectations were so high on this movie!After seeing the teaser, everyone expected Kabali to be the next Baasha for Rajinikanth. But sadly, it was all a LIE! I was so angry with Kalaipuli S Thanu (the film's producer) after watching this movie. He purposely misled us by compiling all the best scenes from the movie into a short clip and released it as a teaser. The actual movie looks like a low budget documentary.Though I am not a fan of Pa Ranjith's earlier works, I appreciate his ideologies. But to me, he used Rajinikanth to infuse his ideologies on us. Being a Rajini fan himself, he should have known the kind of Rajini that the audience wants to see on the screen. People loved to see Energetic Rajini who can fight, who can make jokes, who can romance the heroine and who can be a savior. Case in point - Baasha & Sivaji the Boss - Rajinikanth's best movies! But in Kabali, Rajini just looks lazy. He spends 80% of the time just sitting on chair, sharing his stories with youngsters, looking for his wife, chit-chatting with his gang members, chit-chatting with his daughter, chit-chatting with the villain etc. This is not what we came for. Watching Rajini's interview and his stage speeches on Youtube is more fun than watching these scenes!The entire sequence about ""Free Life Foundation"" does not add any value and further adds to the documentary feel of the movie. The youngsters, especially the ""Tiger"" character, are irritating to the max!VILLAINS are a big joke in this movie. Forget about Rajinikanth, these villains do not even deserve to go against Powerstar Sreenivasan. The Taiwan guy's tamil pronunciation made my ears bleed!Cinematography also looks extremely poor. I felt like watching a local Malaysian movie and not a 100cr+ Rajinikanth movie. Is this Intentional? I don't know.This whole idea of showcasing Malaysian Indians plight are also unnecessary and stirs negative ideas and mindsets to the youngsters in Malaysia. Being a Malaysian myself, I can surely say the government here has given ample opportunities and does not oppress them as shown in this movie. There is a strong unity between the Malays, Chinese and Indians living in Malaysia. The problem here is the people's mindset and reluctant to change. Some Indian youngsters here think they are ""cool"" if they joined a gang or have weird haircuts and tattoos. This is exactly what's topping them from improving their quality of life. The parents are also to be blamed. Generally, the tamil boys are not supervised strongly. Education is not given enough importance by these households. Despite living in crime-ridden environment, the parents refuse to move out for the sake of the children because they don't want to leave their comfort zones. This is a sad reality! If the mindset does not change, no one can improve. Does not matter which race they belong to. Therefore, I highly condemn Pa Ranjith to showcase as if the Malaysian govt has been oppressing and discriminating the Malaysian Indians. If you ask me, the Malaysian Govt. has done more to the Indians than what the Indian Govt. has done for its people. They have access to public schools, education loans, scholarships, job opportunities and housing.The director has also thrown a negative light on the Chinese. There is a scene in the movie where Rajinikanth says he will wear Coat suits, shoes and sit on the couch with his legs crossed if Chinese thinks Indians should not do all these. DUDE!!!! This is wrong on so many levels! In the end, Rajini kills all the Chinese gangsters. This is again not the right solution to solve the plight of Malaysian Indians!Overall, from my banter, you should have known I REALLY HATE THIS MOVIE! And yet, Rajinikanth's next movie is again with the same director. *SighAVOID THIS AT ALL COST!"
" K A B A L I - A song of fire and ice !!!
",-0.5067,0.9951,2018-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Shivaji Rao Gaekwad aka RAJNI the numero Super Star of Indian Cinema. Charisma is his definition and Style is his representation; that raw magnetism seduces scores of people into thronging the theaters across the globe. To top, his simplicity and earthy nature have augmented his ever growing fan base. No wonder, his movies were used as a case study to analyze the business of Indian cinema.Kabali is Pa Rajnith's 3rd directorial venture. He sure did taste success with his first two outings. Rajni is at his stylish best in Kabali. Pa Ranjit needs to be lauded undoubtedly for showcasing Rajni in such a sleeky classy way. The way Rajni is presented with thumping BGM sure gives you goose bumps and instantly raises decibel levels in the auditorium. Adrenaline pumping, electrifying, Pure Rajni delirium. Rajni's acting is top notch and is a discourse for all the current gen and upcoming artistes. Thaliava daa !!When you have a super star like RAJNI, half the battle is already won. The other half depends on how well you have unfolded the story. Pa Ranjit miserably fails in this aspect. The narration is dead slow even for a passionate moviegoer. Even a snail would have crawled faster. I could hear the seconds hand ticking on my watch. ""Wtf, this is Rajni's movie dude. Don't do this Pa Ranjit"" whined my Rajni frenzy mind and continued it's love-hate relationship with the director. There are so many scenes which could have been chopped off on the editing table. Also, to bring out the right emotions in a drama, you need to cast the right folks. Except for Thailava, Radhika Apte and Winston Chao all the other supporting cast were not up to the snuff. Music by Santosh Narayan is superb and Neruppu Da (I luv the tamil version) has already topped the chart busters and continues to enthrall music lovers around the world as I write about it. BGM impresses in bits.Someone told me that a picture is worth a thousand words....so here's Kabali graph /\___^^___/\ - The first 15 min movie sky rockets, then crashes like the stock market during a recession, next for a few blocks in between wakes you up from slumber and gives you the much required kick and finally the last 15 min provide you a proper adieu. Rest all is Hum Ka'Bali'. Neruppu Da gets dampened due to the icy cold storyline.Kabali was made for the love of a man. (fyi, 'For the love of a man' is a documentary made in 2015 exploring Rajni's craze). It's a decent attempt to showcase Rajni's trademark style and niagara the auditorium with his aura. Better focus on story and narration could have fully satiated the audience. If you have enough patience to remain idle in the dark for over an hr in an auditorium filled with hundreds of like minded fans, then try not to miss this one for RAJNI. PS: If you are uncertain of handling the in between 'bali', then the teaser is the best option. You can watch it umpteen times on youtube !!"
" A ""Nayakan"" reboot with mixed results
",0.0,0.7571,2018-05-27 00:00:00,4,"Kabali's trailer may have excited die hard Rajnikanth fans with the swagger and punches the actor is known for, but for neutrals, this depature from the norm neither has a proper story nor does it feel any different. Ranjith's usual take on dalit politics this time focusses on the plight of Malaysian Tamils against the local dada with Kabali being brought back into the plight several years later. Looks like the writers have decided to springboard a ""Nayakan"" like backdrop as the basis of the story and weave in a couple of what-if scenarios. What if Nayakan's wife survives but somehow disappears becoming the crux of the hero's plot? What if Nayagan's children were separated by birth only to reunite with the hero under different circumstances? What if Nayakan himself went to Jail for a change? What if Tinnu Anand's father (Nayagan's rival) took over Nayagan's rule and continued to thrive his network/empire post Nayakan's arrest? These were the scenarios which Ranjith had complied to make this film. The screenplay movies at a snails place and only elevates slightly through the action blocks and the reveals. The only constants in a Rajinikanth film is the one-dimensional villain, this time being international (Winston Chao.) and the hero ka funda result of getting the final blow on the big bad. Kabali showed some promise, but the presentation and the propaganda of the malay tamils felt shoehorned.In the end, both Nayakan and Kabali share one thing. They both ended up killing the protagonist. Ranjith and Rajnikanth have teamed up for Kaala (coming up in a week as of this writing.) The intial trailer/soundtrack yields a Kabali hangover, but as Producer Dhanush has told time and again, there are more opportunities for mass moments than what was presented in Kabali. Let's hope the screenplay is more engaging too."

" Only too much hype, but still a good movie
",0.5927,0.9892,2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"This is another example, how the Indian film producer S.Thanu is raising the expectations for a movie way too high, without thinking about the quality of the movie. With all due respect, making marketing like this has nothing to do with talent. The movie Kabali is easily the best movie of Superstar Rajini since Enthiran. It's totally a movie you should watch for the plot and the whole cast and not only for Rajini. What was good? First of all, the best thing about this movie is the godlike background score by Santhosh Narayanan, which is one of the best in Tamil cinema history in my opinion. It's not only good sounding, but on top of that it is played very wisely. This guy really is some kind of Hans Zimmer of India. Then the character development of most of the characters were great, especially Jeeva, which was performed extra-ordinary by Dinesh. I totally love that Rajini was playing a role, which was fitting to him. And all in all the first half of the movie was great in every aspect. Story-Telling at it's finest by Pa.Ranjith. One could totally relate to the tension of Kabali. The last sequence was a master-piece.What didn't feel right for me? Evan if the story is great, Pa.Ranjith still put in some forced Rajini moves. This movie didn't need that. Sometimes it killed the atmosphere of the movie. Although the characters were great, the movie didn't use the full potential of the characters. Especially the potential of Jeeva and Meena was wasted. While the first half was great, the second half was disappointing. It was too slow-paced and it was dragging. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. What disappointed me as well was the Kumaran character. Kalaiyarasan wasn't really the right choice for this character and the character development of this character wasn't complete as well.So, don't watch the movie with the thought of watching a bad movie. But don't watch it with too high expectations as well."
" Review – Kabali (2016)
",0.0,0.9892,2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"It'd be wrong to say I absolutely enjoyed Thalaivar's latest outing. However, it must also be said that 'Kabali' isn't a flick that follows the typical goofy and over-the-top masala entertainer template (of the actor himself) from his earlier years. There is neither any forced comedy, nor any catchy one-liners or Rajni doing any totally insane stunts (like the one we saw towards the climax in 'Lingaa'). Director Ranjith's stamp is evident throughout as he limits the action to only wherever the necessity arises. The movie is a subtly nuanced low- brow drama for most part before the interval, post which we are handed out some bloated gangster scenarios and sheer bloodbath.What I liked most about Kabali is the fact that Rajni, for a good part of the run-time, held the elegant demeanor of a normal family- man (husband, father) and Pa Ranjith needs to be given a pat on his back for reminding us of the'actor' Rajni we'd been missing out all this while. Few scenes that involve the combination of Rajni-Radhika Apte and Rajni-Dhansika are executed sufficiently well. Both the ladies bring in their unique styles and warmth to the otherwise grim proceedings. Winston Chao looks dashing in his velvety suits but I am not exactly sure if he was a great villain or not. The fault therein lies in the screenplay for making his character and many others look like cardboard cutouts with barely anything substantial to add to the storyline other than the obvious. Almost all characters are portrayed in shades of black or white.Few characters exhibit shades of grey as well such as the one played by Kalaiyarasan but leave lesser impact than intended. What I found pretty boring are the flashback portions in the first half. It shows the rise of Rajni as a rebellious don yes, but where it fails head- over- heels is the fact that unlike what Ranjith and much of the pre- release hype claimed, the movie barely focuses on the wrongdoings done to Malaysian Tamils on a bigger canvas when it had the perfect opportunity to do so. Just one scene where Rajni blurts out (in English) the need for 'equal pay for all' to an estate manager wasn't exactly all that convincing to buy any sort of empathy from me as viewer.The songs by Santhosh Narayanan are amazing but mostly relegated to the background, as if every track was initially added as BGM and later reworked. Cinematography was quite alright, and few drone shots were interestingly pulled off. What Pa Ranjith could've turned into a benchmark of a gangster film looks sortof jaded and mediocre because of the strictly subpar screenplay, unlike his earlier 'Madras' or 'Attakathi'. There is nothing particularly impactful happening in the first half of the movie until the interval block. These scenes could've been rewritten or reworked with another experienced writer and maybe, just maybe they would've worked wonders. The supporting cast (Dinesh, Nasser, John Vijay, Kishore etc.) give in their all to make the film look really polished on the outside. If Ranjith could've diverted some of the attention from the (seen-before scenario of) drugs, murder and extortion to the real wrongdoings done to Malaysian Tamils, the film would have left an even bigger impression. Agree the film would look more docu-dramaish than it already is, but at least it would've been a movie that drove home a solid point.In this case, the viewer just GETS TO KNOW that Ranjith had a REAL STORY to tell, but lost focus since he had to cater to SuperStar's massive fan-base and ultimately ended up fully satisfying neither the fan nor the general viewer. At best, Kabali is a one-time watch for Rajni's on-screen charisma and Radhika Apte's womanly charm.Handed out lavish budgets and big stars to work with, quite a few small-time Tamil directors seem to have experienced setbacks in their recent ventures. Take a look at 'Puli' by Chimbu Deven or '10 Enradhukulla' by Vijay Milton or 'Masss' by Venkat Prabhu or 'Billa 2' by Chakri Toleti. 'Kabali' is by all means few notches above these films but when it could've been a sureshot trendsetter, it just seems content with being an 'OKAY' film."
