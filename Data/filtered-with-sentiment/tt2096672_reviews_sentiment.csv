" Extremely bad, almost the bottom of the barrel, but not the worst
",0.4668,0.4616,2021-03-14 00:00:00,2,"Sadly, I had to watch this movie all 1 hour and 49 minutes of this trainwreck. I knew it would not be as good as the original, as that's somewhat of a Hollywood trend, but I didn't expect it tone this bad. The movie has its moments, but a once in a while good joke and a cute moment is not enough to save this movie.First, let me get the things I like about the movie out of the way to we can get into the meat and potatoes of this review later:The bike on the bus was pretty funny and I thought that was a good joke
The joke about just how short the trip to the house was was charming
The last gag got a ""heh"" from me, what most other jokes didn't getAnd thats about it. It wasn't that good. The characters were shallow, and I didn't feel much connection to them. The main conflict is literally defeated at the end, essentially making the entire movie pointless. Most the jokes were dry and humorless, but not in a funny way. Most the time, I like bone-dry humor, but this isn't exactly how to do it. The story was a little boring, and I almost cried when I saw that 1972 Cadillac Hearse get destroyed, as shown by my name. It felt like 25 minute into the film, the director got drunk and then said ""I'mm gunna go tooda bathdroom"" and then 7 hours later, the other dudes were like
""Hey, you seen the director?""
""Nah, last time I saw him he was walking to that room labeled 'Roof Access'""
Really sad to see a classic made into this thing. If they didn't include the dog mobile for 14 seconds, then this could be completely separated from the original movie."
" Dumb and Dumber 2
",-0.7003,0.7975,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Respect the Film's before you Judge it.
Both of these Films 1 and 2 were Fantastic Jeff and Jim were Both very funny in both of these Farrel Brother Film's.
Remember everyone it's called DUMB AND DUMBER. They both are kind of STUPID. The FILM IS MENT TO BE REALLY STUPID AND MAKE NO SENCE. Like at the end when BOTH FIND OUT that not one of them are the DADDY. Hello DUMMIES you have to have SEX FIRST. That's what makes it so funny they both are so STUPID. It just makes you laugh But the GIRL DAUGHTER IS NOT MUCH SMARTER THEN THE BOTH OF THEM.
You have to just LOVE the Film's even more when you see Jeff in all his Different Film's why? He plays alot of serious rools he only took this one on for working with the MASTER OF COMEDY JIM CARRY."
" This was horrifying
",-0.5719,-0.92,2021-02-11 00:00:00,1,A lot of the jokes were creepy. Some were really disturbing (the one with the dog was the worst). I can't believe I got through the whole thing. It just made me feel dead inside.I'm gonna pretend a sequel to Dumb and Dumber doesn't exist.
" Not the Most Annoying Comedy Sequel in the World
",0.6432,0.8463,2020-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Comedy sequels are usually pretty terrible, and I didn't think that Dumb and Dumber, one of my all-time favorite comedies, really needed a sequel. Sadly, I was right. The jokes in Dumb and Dumber To aren't as funny and I feel like it crossed the line of good taste more than the original. Maybe I'm just getting older, like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. I laughed a few times, but Dumb and Dumber To doesn't totally redeem itself."
" A forgettable sequel
",0.0,-0.9537,2020-11-21 00:00:00,4,"This sequel was released twenty years after the original Dumb and Dumber movie, but it did not bring anything new and its plot was basically a recycled version of the story that served as the basis for the previous installment.Even in comparison with hundreds of forgettable comedies that were released during the 2010s, there was nothing about this second Dumb and Dumber movie that would make it stand out among them.The jokes were for the most part old-fashioned and stale. Thus, they made a significant contribution to the conclusion that the movie eventually turned out to have a very low entertainment value in relation to the fact that it ran for almost two hours.The characters suffered from many of the same problems as the plot and generally appeared to have been copy-pasted from the first Dumb and Dumber movie in a comparable fashion.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels frequently struggled to be amusing and rather created the impression that this second Dumb and Dumber movie was a poorly executed parody of the first one, ultimately leaving Kathleen Turner as more or less its only consistent performer."

" I've seen some bad movies but jfc
",-0.3071,0.4316,2020-08-26 00:00:00,3,"I love bad movies. Horrible action flicks with cheesy oneliners, awful b-list horror movies with low budgets and people who can't act. No matter how bad, most of them have some kind of redeeming factor. This movie doesn't. As amazing as the first movie was, this one is just so awful I genuinely wish I could erase it from my memory. It misses all the marks that made the first one great. I don't know what happened during the making of this movie, but for the love of god don't ever let it happen again."
" Enjoyed it!
",0.5562,0.9773,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Watched this movie twice in a month, at first I thought this is much hilarious, and the plot is better than the original Dumb and Dumber. Soonly I realized that both are equally good! I believe the original movie fans would love this, as it brought back so much memories.
The downside is the sequel has 20 years gap, there would be some people who had forgotten the sense of humour from the original film, or they just simply missed it. Anyways, this is a great movie for the weekend!
This sequel is kind of underrated, I love this film and definitely recommend this."
" Don't mind the low ratings. It is funny!
",0.6131,0.6327,2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, dont understand all these low ratings. Perhaps, they had higher expectations coming from the first 1994 movie. Maybe it is not as good as that one but still very funny:) i laughed a lot"

" Can you lose your virginity twice?
",-0.4019,0.9491,2020-03-31 00:00:00,8,"No you can't but with such nostalgia and great expectation this will inevitably lead to disappointment.The fact is, the second time round when you aren't thinking about how good it is to watch dumb and dumber again, but it's not as amazing as you remember, you will relax and enjoy it in it's own right.I haven't laughed as much watching a movie in a long time. It was less entertaining the first time round, but now the excitement and expectation has indeed worn off it's hugely funny.You can't lose your virginity twice but you can still have a lot of fun."
" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.9604,2020-03-19 00:00:00,1,"When a film sequel has the same directors and actors as the original you expect it to be almost or as good as the first. ""How Harry Met Lloyd"" is a more entertaining film than this one and it's a different cast and director. Like Zoolander 2 and Anchorman 2, the actors have simply lost their touch. This movie is painfully unfunny. As just a movie. Compared to the original, it's a massive disappointment. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels seem to have forgotten their characters. The script fails. It's bad. Bad, bad, bad. This film is very forgettable. Dumb and Dumber is a golden comedy classic and this film did not deliver at all, by any standard."
" Downhill!
",0.0,-0.8074,2020-03-15 00:00:00,5,"I believe it was Jeff Daniels who said that the directors of Dumb and Dumber were ""guessing"" about what would be funny the first time, but ""now they know.""
If that is the case, they definitely have a fair amount of arrogance and narcissism, because this film is vastly inferior to the original. What started as honest-to-goodness stupidity has given way to a mean-spirited attempt to be funny. Harry and Lloyd are no longer running on their own redundant behaviour alone; they're using their naïveté to hurt others and to be lewd and crude, which is never what the original film was.
This movie has its comedic moments, but it ultimately falls flat, trying too hard in some areas and not hard enough where it truly matters."
" Not As Good As The First, But Still Funny!
",0.5329,0.9696,2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I'll have to admit, when I first watched this sequel I wasn't as thrilled by it. But on repeated viewing, it's really grown on me. Kind of like how I felt about Anchorman 2, which I hated when I first watched it, but now I enjoy watching it as much as the first.
The humor is just as gross here as it was in the first one. The good thing about this movie is that the Farrelly brothers didn't recycle the gags from the first one. They came up with some original funny moments. But they didn't completely ignore the first film, there are a few references sprinkled here and there to it. The ending is kind of weak, but I didn't think the ending to the first film was all that great either.
Overall, a good rainy day movie to watch whenever it's on TV. I'm actually glad they made this movie."
" Still dumb but still happy
",0.5994,0.9903,2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"It was a little sad for me that not Harry or Lloyd were Penny's father but instead it was an unknown character named Pete stainer/Pee-stain who was the real father. And Harry and Lloyd weren't included to the other characters happy ending on being a family.
So the story ended the same way it began Harry and Lloyd are still jobless, single, mediocre, and still dumb but until while they were walking in the side walk they were about to come across 2 beutiful ladies what everyone thought it was their time for success.
But then bush clubed them then laughed and ran away laughing which left me knowing that even when things get down Harry and Lloyd will always stay happy as Dumb and Dumber as they're always lucky to stay happy and the solution to other peoples problems.
And at the end credits we see their history on how happy they are being the best of friends travelling across the country and getting into situations without noticing it sometimes and in conclusion Dumb and Dumber To is the best comedy film experience ever knowing no matter how bad things get good things will turn up as the way it began"
" Absolutely horrendous
",-0.624,-0.8955,2019-12-24 00:00:00,1,"How is it possible to destroy an absolute classic, there was absolutely no need for a follow up for dumb & dumber, just cashing in. Disgraceful."

But it's really hard not to love how true to the original they were with the humor, and honestly this movie has about 3-5 jokes per minute, and at least 40% of them land. Add em all up at the end of the day, and you've got the most I've laughed in the theatre in like a decade."
" Train wreck
",-0.4404,-0.1531,2019-11-23 00:00:00,2,"Shallow humored, wave riding, train wreck.This movie was very hard to watch, it came in a double feature and I'll now be forced to incinerate both moviesGreat lighting, very solid set design."

" A disappointment

The first one was one of the funniest films I have seen, but this one is just simply not funny. The plot is pointless, and the jokes are not nearly as good as they were.

" Literally dumber
",-0.3612,-0.4529,2019-09-26 00:00:00,5,"The sequel of the comedy cult ""Dumb and dumber"" concentrates the attention on recovering an hidden daughter for ask her to give her kidney to Harry (the discovered father), because he's ill. The connection with the first movie is due to a giant sketch made by Lloyd, that pretend to be mad for twenty years. This and others absurd sketches are the ratio of this movie, as for the first chapter, but they appear a little far-fetched. Funny as a movie to see with friends or for who miss this two mad characters (but the first movie is a lot better)."
" This film flat for my taste
",0.0,-0.0258,2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Dumb & Dumber To fell flat for me. I had HIGH EXPECTATIONS because of the first one. It has laughter throughout the movie, love, betrayal surprising moments also."

Watched with an open mind knowing it wouldn't be as good. Really enjoyed.
Watched again recently and was liking it so much more than I remembered. It's bloody hilarious.
Don't compare it to the first. Just enjoy seeing those fantastic characters together again.
Great storyline. And some genuine laugh out loud moments.
Genius comedy gold."
" Stoopid fun
",0.5106,-0.7089,2019-07-26 00:00:00,7,"Dumb and Dumber was clever about how stupid it was. This film is just stupid. The humour is more gross than slapstick and a lot of the jokes miss their mark.That being said, I did laugh. That's probably more of an indictment of me than the film."
" Better than part one
",0.4404,0.9121,2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,"To judge a comedy, I suppose, you simply have to laugh to think it´s a good comedy. And in terror-genre you have to fear. It seems to me these two genres are the most difficult in present movie-industry because with special effects you don´t get into the goal: you have to know the human heart.
I never heard of Jim Carrey before this film (I am more into the classic stuff, Peter Sellers etc) except ""I love you Philip Morris"" that I found more tragic and pathetic than funny.
So to put it in the simple way, I laughed a lot while watching this, but after searching for the first part to my hands, and watching Carrey and Jeff Daniels when they were 20 years younger, I would give to the original only 5/10.
And as + 40 old myself it gave me a lot of hope!"
" Jim Carrey's Worst
",-0.6249,-0.9905,2019-07-18 00:00:00,2,"While I liked the first Dumb & Dumber, this sequel was simply dreadful. It had only two laughs, but other than that, Dumb & Dumber To was a bad sequel and is easily Jim Carrey's worst film.20 years have gone by and Lloyd and Harry are on another road adventure. This time Harry needs a new kidney and realizes he has a long-lost daughter. So the two idiots travel through different transportations and get into kinds of trouble along the way.The first film had a small amount of childish moments, but had more funny and clever moments than childish. This film, on the other had, was borderline immature. Both Carrey and Daniels were rusty and wasted and couldn't help save the movie. The story felt almost like the first movie's but more watered down and uninteresting.One more thing, if this was done at least five years after the first film, it would of been better. But instead, it is 20 years too late.Overall, Dumb and Dumber To is Jim Carrey's worst movie to date and is a horrendous sequel."
" my notes
",0.0,0.9496,2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I laughed a LOT in this movie. not sure why everyone was so down on it. obviously not nearly as good as the first. some jokes fell flat for felt forced (alliteration) and some were predictable, but most were hilarious. full volume laughing at least 20 times in the movie. so many new ways to show how dumb they are. the story was pretty much the same but ummmmm who cares. lots of scenes and funny parts called back to the first one, and frequently added something new to it. had a very similar feel to the first, which is what you want in a sequel (3 viewings)"
" Just AWFUL! AWFUL!!!
",-0.8636,0.8882,2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I seriously don't understand how this movie got any reviews with anything over 5 stars. I seriously feel bad for the people who rated it 8 (let alone 10). What are their standards/tastes? These people are allowed to vote and drive, and clearly don't have the faculties to do either.This is just unimaginative, predictable, EXTREMELY forced, and... frankly painful to watch - not the least but funny. Yes, the original was dumb, thus the title; however it was at least unique and goofy and, although low brow, had a few decent laughs (if nothing else because it was unexpected). For the sequel, they just reheated the original, took out any charm, and dialed up the crudeness by 10x.Even watching this for free on TV I feel cheated. Honestly, I don't know how they convinced Jeff Daniels to do this. I know Jim Carey is trying to revive his career, but this just hammers home that he's a one trick pony whose antics are tired and outdated."

",0.636,0.9785,2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"They kept the original style maintained, loved the humor, loved the dynamics between Harry and Lloyd and laughed a lot.Somehow people always seem to rate sequals like this poorly because they expect a duplicate of the first movie.

As expected Jeff Daniels plays a straight man for Jim Carrey in most of their scenes.

Nothing can be worse than Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, now that was a garbage movie."

",0.2382,0.984,2018-08-23 00:00:00,5,"This wasn't the worst movie ever, was better than all the other movies filmed by dumb and dumber wannabes.The problem is that the storyline which was pretty solid in the first film, was taken and parts of our memories were changed by the new information we find out in this film.Parts of it were elaborated on and certain people we heard about in the first were finally shown in this film. It's not so much of a problem, but it wasn't done the best way.The other part is, Harry and Lloyd were completely different. You could not take them seriously at all, which is something I loved about the first film. Even though in the first movie they were stupid, goofy and such, they did have depth and would be serious at times. You could take them seriously, they also did have intelligence but it was not so much that it made their stupidity unbelievable.In this film, they got into that goofy and stupidity car and drove beyond the speed limit. If they said anything or showed any emotion, it was overpowered by a sense of goofyness, unlike the first film.Now I wasn't expecting this to BE the first one. I was just expecting them to act more like they were in the first. Even though the story was stale and it was quite funny at times, I think them acting more like they did in the first film might just have saved it and made it more watchable.They seem as if they were trying way too hard to make it good, by that I mean everyone involved in the making of the movie.I enjoyed it for the nostalgia and getting to see Jeff and Jim back together again. I just wish it had gone better, like everyone else did."

There are so few comedies made now. Everything is digital effects and explosions. 
Fans of Harry and Lloyd would love to see another adventure with the boys. 
Great comedy team. Maybe stick away from the toilet humor,, it's a little funny for 12 year old boys,, but that's it. Otherwise,, come on.. lets see what they are up to for their third adventure. 
The possibilities are endless!"
" ""I like it ALOT""....- Lloyd
",0.3612,-0.9152,2018-06-06 00:00:00,7,"....but not as much as the first D&D. The first D&D was a classic! It had a lot of laughs. However, for this movie, most of the jokes from the first were recycled. What I mean is that most jokes from the first D&D were used in the second. For example, they reused the ""most annoying sound in the world"" and instead used the 2ND most annoying sound in the world. SPOILER: The ""2nd most annoying sound in the world"" is when Lloyd kept rapidly ringing a doorbell multiple times on some old dude's house( Mr. Peabody). Belive it or not, Lloyd actually does this again while on the search for HArry's daughter. Another reused joke was their prank. SPOILER: In the first D&D, Lloyd and Harry put a spicy food on the bad guy's burger and he starts choking. In this movie, Lloyd and Harry setup fireworks in the bad guy's motel room and set them off. Like, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? The funny thing is that they didn't even think if the explosion would kill him. After the fireworks, the bad guy runs out his motel room ON FIRE, LITERALLY ON FIRE, and jumps right into a pool.Funny, but not cool."

The perfect example of being a smart and dumb movie: The characters are dumb, but the screenplay is smart in terms of the dumb jokes ""being"" the story rather than ""replacing"" the story. For example: If Alfred Hitchcock was alive today, he wouldn't know the surprises until the final thirty minutes either! This has the most surprise twists since the final 30 minutes or so of the Shawshank Redemption."

That excitement went away quickly at the beginning of the movie.Compared to the prequel ""Dumb and Dumberer"", this was worse and I thought the prequel was awful. You know you have a shit movie when the best part has Bob Saget.What made the first movie so great was you knew that they were dumb but the writing was executed so brilliantly that there's a method to their madness. This one just resorts to immature and junior high level humor and the daughter is more annoying than they are.Major disapppointment!"
" What A Shame
",-0.4767,-0.9773,2018-03-05 00:00:00,2,"To have the opportunity to continue the hilariousness that is of LLoyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, and completely butcher it, making them not DUMB anymore, but full-blown retarded...I mean...what a shame. What a DAMN shame!Had this been made in the 90s...it may have been better. But, humor has changed over the last 20 years. Nobody thinks subtleties are funny anymore. Today, you have to be almost absolutely foul in order to get a chuckle. And it hurts characters like these guys, because they weren't meant to be foul. They were meant to be simple. And it worked back then! But now? Not so much. Simple is no longer funny. Simple makes you have to think...and nobody likes thinking anymore. If it's not in your face offensive, it's not hilarious! Desensitization is to blame here.Seriously what were they thinking, though...not knowing what ""sex"" is? Not knowing how human reproduction works? And lets talk about how slipping back into character was a complete FAIL for Daniels, but easy peasy for Carey. It was so obvious that it was painful to watch! Talk about a real struggle. This character MADE Daniels...but jumping back into him proved to be a impossible task. It was as if Daniels was trying to jump into the character of Harry of when he was a teen, played by Derek Richardson in Dumb and Dumberer- (another terrible movie).You directors had the world and you crushed it.

" Great comedy movie with a good story!
",0.8687,0.9949,2017-11-24 00:00:00,5,"Wow, I am the first. That's surprising for such a good comedy movie. I enjoyed this movie, I really did. In fact, I enjoyed it more than the first movie. Although, the first movie were great, I loved this more (which is very unusual). The reason for this was this had a such lovely story. I loved the story they wrote for this movie. Throughout the movie they made us believed that the person who were mentioned were her father. First, we were informed that Harry were her father. But once we knew Lyiod's past we were made to believe he were her father until, eventually, it got revealed that Pee-Stain (can't remember real name xD) were his father.It was also funny to see the ironic in this movie. Liyoid were so hot for Penny that he wanted to sleep and have sex with her at anytime, until he thought he were her father. It's ironical that he couldn't care if it were Harry's child, but when he thought it were his own flesh and blood, that opinion changed. I loved how they visualized it.But the best point that makes this comedy movie very unique and one of the best I have seen, is that the humor. It's so fantastic that it suits all ages, even small children. I liked that even in the sequel they could maintain the humor and not make a boring movie after a so long gap between the two movies. Usually the sequel is never better than the prequel. but here it wasn't the case. In fact, it was better. Overall I think it deserve a 5/9. Definitely! To be comedy movie, I don't think there is anything I would change in the movie to make it better."
" I was disappointed when walking out of the theaters
",-0.4767,0.8969,2017-10-21 00:00:00,5,"When I was in 6th grade and after watching the film, it wasn't good as I expected to be. I haven't watch Dumb and Dumber for a while and it was miles better than this film. They're some funny scene but it doesn't save the movie. It feels rush like the story line is dull. I wish they did better and if they're a third sequel please give it to the right writer please?"
" Good movie not as good as original
",0.4203,0.784,2017-10-09 00:00:00,6,"When you make a movie to late in the ballgame like this one, well you get a decent movie but not great, the characters were a little bit off from the original but what do you expect after almost 20 years. I really didn't care for the plot, I am sure they could of come up with something better than what they did so it was decent but could of been so much better had they made this movie 15 or 20 years ago!"
" It's not THAT bad
",0.431,0.9532,2017-09-03 00:00:00,5,"Let me start off by saying how much I loved the original 'Dumb and Dumber' movie. It remains today one of my favourite comedies of all time and one of a select few movies that I'll never grow tired of. Let me also say that making a sequel was a terrible idea in the first place. It was never going to be as good as the first film, especially with it being a whole 20 years later. Heck, I wasn't even born when the first film came out!Having said that, I don't think 'Dumb and Dumber To' is as bad as some are saying it is. It did make me laugh on occasion and I could appreciate a lot of the attempted jokes, even if they weren't laugh out loud funny like in the first film. It also lacks wit and originality. I must have counted 5 or 6 jokes that had been copied from the original movie. They even copied the famous daydream scene but with a different scenario. I'll admit, 'Dumb and Dumber To' isn't very good... but part of me is sort of pleased that I got to see this iconic comedy duo at it again. It made me smile, but I think I'll stick to the original - the Godfather of the comedy genre - in the future."
" Some things should NEVER be on film...
",0.0,-0.9339,2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,"I won't get into all of the details of why this movie is so bad, others have done that. I wanted to like this, the first was so bad it was good. Unfortunately ""humor"" these days is rarely humorous and this movie is no different. The biggest disappointment is that anyone would think the scene with the poor dog is funny. Bestiality, even just implied, is NEVER funny and should never be mainstream, shame on Hollywood for thinking that's okay. It was disgusting and for this reason alone you should avoid this movie."
" Not as bad as everyone says it is
",0.431,0.7906,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"You can see thought and talent went into this, despite it being a hit and miss.The plot is interesting and well structured enough to hook-drag the viewer to the end, although its somewhat derivative of the first one. It ties and resolves everything nicely at the end. The performances are okay, at times a bit too over-the-top (Jim Carrey).Jokes are fairly entertaining for the first half of the movie, but falls apart in the second half.Enjoyed it personally, therefore 7.5 out of 10."
" dumb and hilarious
",-0.1531,0.9958,2017-05-06 00:00:00,10,"wow ! this is the funniest movie of all time, a must see for comedy addicts.i don't believe in formulas for a good comedy movie but i sure would like to know the formula behind this movie.funnier than first one , enjoy WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1. i am a huge Jim Carrey comedy fan ( not eternal sunshine of spotless crap ). 2. i love comedy. 3.farrelly brothers direct a lot of comedies.

" I Just Don't Get It
",0.0,-0.9172,2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"Why? They waited 20 years to make a sequel, and the script is so lame. The same old joke and gags. The same everything. Are we to believe that Harry and Lloyd are virgins? They're not dumb, they're just plain stupid. This turned them into mean-spirited idiotic buffoons, with none of the charm from the first movie. I was so excited to see this, but even the first gag was ludicrous. 20 years pretending to be mentally ill? Come on."
" Not Worth The Film It's Made On
",-0.1695,0.9795,2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Comedy can be a tricky thing to understand. Twenty years ago, the Farrelly brothers had the pulse on EXACTLY the type of humor that would go over well with audiences. Sadly, the years have not been kind to this ""franchise"", as ""Dumb & Dumber To"" has to rate fairly high on my all- time disappointment list. It just doesn't seem to remember what the original was all about.For a basic plot summary, this film sees our old pals Harry Dunn (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) reunited again in their search to find old flame Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner). Once discovered, Fraida tells Harry that he has a daughter, Penny (Rachel Melvin), who may be the only one who can save a kidney-failing Harry. A familiar-looking road trip ensues.The main problem with this movie is that the creators don't seem to understand/remember what made the original so successful in the first place. That one was so incredibly funny because it was essentially relatable humor. Did it turn to gross-out humor a bit? Certainly. But if you have the right sense of humor for the film in the first place, you'll still laugh every time Harry's stomach starts churning and he runs into the bathroom. That movie felt fresh, witty, and it is still what I consider to be the greatest single comedy I've ever seen.One wonders, then, how this ""sequel"" (I hate to even acknowledge it as part of the franchise) could be so royally awful being made by the same Farrelly brothers?! Are they really that out of touch with what is/isn't funny anymore? The cardinal sin here is that they essentially turn this movie into gross-out humor. Like I mentioned, though, that is never what D&D was all about. It wasn't the ""gross stuff"" selling the jokes, it was the circumstances and the actors. In ""To"", however, all that is surrounding the gross-outs is a paper-thin plot and a re-hashing of nearly EVERY gag from the original. You name a joke from 1994, and they probably covered it again here.After anticipating this film for such a long time, I can now clearly see some of the strangeness surrounding its frequent delays. First, Jim Carrey all but threatens to pull out of the project (did he finally realize it was going to be an inevitable dog?) and has to be roped back in. Then, that long-rumored Jennifer Lawrence cameo fails to materialize (one has to wonder if her publicist advised against appearing in such a train-wreck the weekend before ""Mockingjay Part One""). Even the trailer was horrible, where usually the funniest parts are shown.Truth be told, I never laughed once the entire movie. Talk about a complete 180 from the original! This is truly an abomination and a money-grab if I ever saw one (I'm glad I only donated $6). Nobody involved with this project could have predicted any kind of success past a decent opening weekend based on name alone.So, while not at all ruining my perception of the classic original, it is just kind of a shame that this project had to come together so poorly. I can't think of a sequel that has been worse."
" Too little, Too late Harry!
",0.0,-0.949,2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"Dumb And Dumber is my favourite comedy of all time, it told the story of two dimwits named Harry and Lloyd who travel across the country to deliver a briefcase with money in to a girl Lloyd fell over heels in love with, all whilst being pursued by thugs who wanted the money themselves. there was a prequel in 2003 but the less said about that, the better. but when it was announced in 2013 that a sequel was in development, I was excited but when I eventually saw it, boy was I disappointed.Harry and Lloyd reunite to again travel across the country to get a kidney from Harrys supposed long lost daughter Penny, who Lloyd has a crush on, whilst annoying any normal person on the way. their characters are botched in this film, turning them from good hearted yet highly unintelligent grown men, to bullying pranksters who cause so much trouble, you don't root for them as you did originally.Another problem is they rehash jokes from the original and dumb them down a lot, (Weird Outfits, Lloyds daydream about killing baddies to impress his crush, strange cars, and having a henchman riding with them.) overall it just comes off as a cheap re hash of the original.As with a lot of Adam Sandlers recent movies, the same brand of humour that The Farrelly Brothers made us crack up at in the original, are lost here."
