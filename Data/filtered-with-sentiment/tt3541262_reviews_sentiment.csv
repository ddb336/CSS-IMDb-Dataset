" The story is a mess
",-0.3612,-0.2732,2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"If one reads about the actual battle, they would realize that the just following the real life events would have made the movie a master epic. Instead they decided to make a pop story with a bit of romance thrown in for flavour. Disappointed."
" Brutal Korean War Film
",-0.8402,-0.4404,2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Roaring Currents was an awesome film about the Battle of Myeongnyang, a remarkable navel engagement where 13 Korean ships were able to defeat a Japanese navy that was nearly 30 times their size. The bulk of the film was about the battle itself where it showed a gory affair as sailors had to use cannons, muskets, and arrows against each other before having to enter close-quarters combat. I like that Admiral Yi used the environment to advance - he forced the Japanese down a bottleneck and into difficult waters. My major combat is that I didn't get to know much about the characters and the story about Yi being famed as a traitor, tortured, and then reinstated would have been an interesting story in its own right."
" What cinema's made for
",0.0,0.948,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"ROARING CURRENTS is an excellent historical war epic from South Korea and, rather incredibly, a true story. It tells of Admiral Yi and his stand against an invading naval force of 330 Japanese ships; he only has 12 to bring to the fight. The film follows a standard format with careful set-up in the first half followed by all-out action in the second, and what action it is! It's on an obviously smaller scale than similar fare like John Woo's RED CLIFF, with the occasional dodgy CGI shot or lack of ships, but generally it works a treat. Great choreography throughout and the usual impassioned performances you see in Korean cinema make it an exciting piece of spectacle, just the kind of story that cinema is made for."
" Multiple layers and perspectives
",0.0,0.9737,2020-10-08 00:00:00,8,"The story goes deep. On the surface, The admiral Lee saves the country from Japanese attack, and his brilliant strategy is detailed in naval battle scene. However, he was fighting against his own demons, regrets, and pain. Many mention the battle scene at the end, but I love the scene of his dreams. Black color, darkness, smoke, and camera work create the mysterious and dreamy ambiance. I'm sure his battle of the war and of his own darkness are portrayed well with this kind of atmosphere.The story goes wide. The main character is Admiral Lee, but the story of his son, Mr. Lim & Mrs. Jung, and Japanese admiral is well-developed, making the movie richer and fuller. The audience can feel for unsung heroes and their sublime sacrifices for the country. We can understand son's respect AND agony for having the great father working for greater good rather than family. The frustration, fear, and inferiority of Japanese side are illustrated, making a hero more holy and sacred."
" Impressive naval battle scenes
",0.1779,0.9783,2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"I had to do some research but realizing that this was based on real events in the past made it much more enjoyable. Fortunately I was able to see it with subtitles (and not dubbing) and the cinematography and costumes were impressive. Not for those who can't handle gory scenes, but really enjoyed this. Budget was <$20mn but make like $140mn worldwide so a testament to the popularity. I recommend it"
" ""Do not look back when the only course is forward.""
",0.0,0.836,2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Whether you love it or hate it, you have to admit the movie was an amazing technical achievement. The staging and choreography of the naval battle scenes almost defy comprehension, the planning and execution was extraordinary. Though historical accuracy is put to the test here, the overriding theme of courage and rising above one's fear of death is at the core of the story. Admiral Yi Sun-Shin (Min-sik Choi) rallies his forces to take on an overwhelming adversary, using his wits and knowledge of the elements to take advantage of conditions that were overlooked by a superior Japanese naval force. There was only one scene that defied credibility, that when the dying man on the gunpowder vessel asked his fiance to signal for it to be destroyed. Amid the chaos, confusion and noise of battle, there's no way that the woman would have been able to understand his request from such a distant vantage point. It made for good drama, but wasn't credible at all. Otherwise, the film was gloriously presented, colorful, and exciting to watch."
" Boring then confusing
",-0.4939,0.4009,2020-05-30 00:00:00,5,I didn't like this movie. The first half is boring beyond words. The battle is impressively filmed and grand with some tense moments. But couldn't tell the Japanese from the Koreans for lots of the battle. Still didn't understand how they used the whirlpool to win. Still it's a grand battle scene.
" Great
",0.6249,0.4767,2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,This is to me the best naval war movie even with true history
" One of my favorites
",0.4215,0.9412,2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,The Admiral and Seven Samurai are my favorite foreign language films of all time. I'm also a sucker for a true story. The true life ordeal has to go down in history as one of the best. Wow. I had to watch it again and again. (to the big end)!
" Great story
",0.6249,0.0567,2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Best Korean historical movie ever
Never getting board
Breathtaking fighting scene
Must watch movie"
" Well it's Korea's movie anyway
",0.2732,-0.128,2019-10-28 00:00:00,5,"Only Korean ships have canons. None of Japanese ships has canons. On average, every Korean ship impacts with over a dozen of Japanese ships, all of which sunk, except Korean ships. They must been made of extraterrestrial materials. Well it's a Korean movie, no bias right?"
" Great Historical Film!
",0.6588,0.9972,2019-08-05 00:00:00,6,"""Myeong-ryang"" or ""The Admiral"" is a South Korean action film/historical epic, is a film about the military campaigns and incredible story of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. And this movie is a very underrated movie that shines light on the military genius, who during the Japanese Invasions of Korean, which lasted from 1592-1598, won every single battle without a casualty. And helped in preventing Korea from being taken by the Japanese. In my opinion, an underrated historical figure, this film shines light on the man's life, and does it quite well...I was very invested in the movie and found it to be quite entertaining and well made. The production value is quite high, and the action scenes are incredible. The movie historically accurate, except for a few areas, which is something I will discuss in the next paragraph. The film also has wonderful visuals and cinematography, and the movie is something to be invested in.Now, my flaws with the movie are few and far between, but still there. They lie in two things, I will get the minor flaw out of the way. The film depicts the battle with the naval battle with the Koreans only winning with the skin of their teeth. And loosing a lot of ships, when the battles were very one sided as I mentioned before, however I understand the reasoning for this creative liberty. I mean, if the film was the Koreans winning every battle with relative ease, you would loose investment. I mean, if they just won with ease, why care? But it's still a major inaccuracy, and the movie could have still worked without that change. My other criticism are the really cheesy scenes with the Korean people being inspired by the character's actions. They never really happened and it's obvious they didn't. Now, again, I see the reason, the people represent the country's spirit. But it's still very cheesy, and a little unneeded.Regardless of the criticisms, I love this movie. The praises I mentioned before are all valid, and I think this is some of South Korea's best work in the filmmaking department. It's a great historical epic, and one of the best movies about history. And it's a movie that makes it's changes for a good reason, unlike movies like ""Braveheart"" that make so many changes 'till it's complete fiction. And it's a movie I highly recommend to anyone."
" Worth seeing it but could have been better.
",0.6486,0.9696,2019-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Its a great movie undoubtedly in terms of story. But there was many scope to make it epic. If the director emphasised much more on strategic vission rather than patriotism, it would be the best of all. Nonetheless. It is worth seeing it and highly recommended who wants to see patriotism, bravery and true event based movie."
" The Admiral
",0.3182,0.5423,2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,That. Was a badass movie.... WOW... It was awesome.
" Please Watch this Movie Atleast once for Admiral Yi Sun Shin
",0.5574,-0.8827,2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,Nothing to really say here! Gobsmacked! I have never come across a movie which had such an impact on me. Sir Yi Sun Shin is my hero. A man who overcame fear by accepting death. The movie also has one of the best liners by the Admiral himself: Don't hold onto life and you will die but fight to the death and you will always live!.
" A great Navel War Movie
",0.0516,0.9623,2019-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Trust me this is one of the best Navel War movie I have ever seen in my life. Everything is synonym for perfection. Impeccable acting, superb direction, great screenplay, background music suits with the screen. A great, gripping movie which will give you goosebumps and will leave you with tears in your eyes. A superb war movie."
" If we can expand our perspective properly, we should have a better plot.
",0.6369,-0.1779,2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"It may be difficult to restore the actual situation of the naval battle, so the plot focuses on the scene of the flagship. Unfortunately, the feeling is that North Korea has only one ship fighting. If we can expand our perspective properly, we should have a better plot."
" one man can turn the tide
",0.0,0.9036,2018-12-10 00:00:00,10,"Roaring currents is one of the greatest historical battle films. The sets and costumes were amazing, the acting was phenomenal, and the directing was paced wonderfully. They certainly make Yi Sun-Shin a heroic figure, but not without some faults. He has a hard time with his men, so he instills fear over courage--all part of his tactics. Actor Min Sik-Choi helps make some of his harsh decisions very human. It was just beautifully crafted, it's incredibly intense and the effects are perfect."
" Impressive!!
",0.5972,0.9705,2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"The most impressive film I've seen in a long time! From beginning to end, the film is simply amazing and the action and excitement never ceases. The visuals are incredibly realistic. It is an incredible story of courage and determination, and how a handful of soldiers accomplished the impossible by defeating an army. The destruction of the enemy ships is so good, its mind blowing!! Simply awesome! One of my favorite films!"
" impressive and immersive
",0.5106,-0.4767,2018-06-10 00:00:00,9,"A good old medeval naval battle in the far east, interesting,and by far , very impresively made too.the use of tidal water currents as a weapon were obviously brilliant,and so are also the production of the battle scenes.with the use of vfx and cgi's its like you are at the scene yourself.considering the low total production costs of this feature film,the result are eminent.only one drawback in this film,its a slow starter,so be patient,the last hour are spectacular."
" Unhistoric to the degree of fantasty
",0.0,0.4674,2018-04-05 00:00:00,5,"I was looking forward to a historic narrative of the battle, the absolute apex of Yi Sun-sin's military career. 
However, the movie's plot is too far away from historic details. I have to say the whole movie is really a fantasy, disguised as a movie based on historic events. 
Or perhaps I shall say the movie is freely inspired by historic events?
It is not a matter about Yi's true ability, I am just deep disappointed overall."
" Interesting but fails on many levels
",-0.431,-0.9726,2017-10-23 00:00:00,5,"For me this was a movie of two halves. And I am well aware that the naval battle is at the center of the story but the first half was better. The battle itself was quite well done but it was too long and I got bored somewhat. I think in one of the Lord of the Rings DVD Extras, they were talking about how people can only focus on a fight scene up to 15 minutes. Then they lose interest and focus. I'd agree with that.Though people may think otherwise, this is not a reason why I put 5/10 at all.It seemed to be an over-stretched film in general. For whatever reason they stretched it like a pizza dough to be 2 hours long when in reality this could have been a slick flick 90 minutes long.Slick? Perhaps that's not quite the right word. The big issue for me was the acting. The actors playing the Japanese were dreadful. The weird pauses, the unconvincing expressions etc... not to mention that they are all Koreans. Why? Couldn't they get a few Japanese actors to speak proper Japanese? Was it a budget constraint?Having said that, the actor who played the Admiral's son was also equally dreadful. Whatever cred he built up in the first half of the film was destroyed by the regular and in my opinion useless cuts to him during the battle. It's always the same emotion and did we really need to see that at least 3 times? Just do it once if you have to, then show the crowd cheering at the end.I much prefer Red Cliff to this. While Admiral started out well, the awful acting and poor editing choices just killed it for me."
" The Admiral Review: Visually so stunning and gripping, couldn't have been any better.
",0.8208,0.9949,2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Movie: The Admiral (15)Rating: 4.5/5 starsSouth Korean Cinema is known worldwide for its excellent films, as they are visually quite strong and emotionally gripping. So is this Choi Min- sik starrer action-war film THE ADMIRAL. I saw it dubbed in Hindi. I was really impressed with the amazing visuals, action & battle scenes, while I was also completely gripped emotionally to the film in the entire second hour.There are many outstanding sequences in the first hour. Emotions are very strong in portrayal throughout the entire film. There are many sequences bound to leave you spellbound, and you'll find yourself short of words to describe the visual excellence of the film.The second hour is totally gripping. Not a single second is wasted. It's a film which has importance not only in South Korean Cinema, but also in world cinema due to its sheer excellence.Choi Min-sik is ultimately powerful in the role he plays. Watch him act throughout the entire film, and you won't feel like he's acting but indeed living the character. Rest of the cast is praiseworthy as not a single performance goes over the top.The film is extremely strong on the technical front. Be it the visual effects, the action sequences or the cinematography, everything is excellent. The powerful BGM enhances the viewing experience, and certain well executed sequences will hold your breath for sure.THE ADMIRAL undoubtedly is one of the best South Korean films, especially in terms of presentation."

" Awesome film!!
",0.6892,0.9339,2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"I think Korean films are amazing. This movie is so good I watched it by myself, told hubby about it (he doesn't usually like foreign films) and he said he wanted to see, so we watched it the next day. It has an excellent cast, acting, and fight sequences. I feel like it had real heart and pride. The scenery and costumes are wonderful. Please watch it!"
" Another example of torturing animals to death in a foreign film
",-0.836,-0.9638,2017-03-31 00:00:00,1,"Strangely I don't mind watching humans killing humans in movies, its made up and so on--But when it comes to killing and torturing animals, its cheaper for them to do it for real then bring in special effects and CGI--They pretty much tear a horse to pieces while it is screaming in terror and pain, kudos to the foreign movie film, and of course it gets heap of awards--Many of our older westerns and war movies out of Hollywood do some of the same stuff--But this is a modern movie, and someone should speak for what was done instead of heralding this dam movie as an epic"
" Ancient Naval Battle
",-0.3818,0.6701,2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"I came across the film accidentally and I found it really entertaining,and gripping. I was quite impressed with this Korean production.The costumes and ships were really good, as was the acting. I like stories about these sort of ancient battles. It reminded me of the Red Cliff (2008), which I also liked.I preferred it to some similar type Hollywood productions.They're starting to exaggerate and overdo some of the acting and scenes; much too far beyond reality. This one did not quite get so carried away.I suppose I'm thinking of the 300, when I say that.I was in Korea in 2014 and had not heard of the film, but I did buy a model turtle ship as a souvenir.The film is based on the historical Battle of Myeongnyang, in which admiral Yi Sun-sin uses the treacherous currents in the Myeongnyang Strait to help him confront a Japanese fleet which massively out numbered his Joseon fleet.Definitely worth its current IMDb mark of 7.2."
" Best Korean Movie of the Year!
",0.6696,0.4794,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie.The battle is epic! This remembers me the movie of 300 but with boats. Few ships against hundreds of them with a lot of violence , history , good performances , sea knowledge and battle experience. Is a must see and I never saw such an navy battle in a movie . Even American producers should learn with the koreans how to do such a good work. In the moment I was watching the movie , i wasn't believing what i was seeing . Such a masterpiece! I was always worried with the admiral and very curious about how the movie would end and i never expected such a close fight and that simple sea knowledge that was fatal to the battle procedure. See the movie and enjoy one of the best battles ever!"
