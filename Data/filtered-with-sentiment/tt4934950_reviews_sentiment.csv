" Law and order.
",0.0,-0.6808,2021-04-10 00:00:00,9,This movie shows the ugly reality of law and order and injustice done by the people in law and order to innocent people.
" Justice is blind.
",0.1779,-0.3043,2021-03-25 00:00:00,7,"When I thought about writing about Talvar, the first thing to strike my mind was that it wasn't a happy ending. Justice wasn't served. But it does represent reality; in fact, it IS based on actual events. It will wake you up from the eutopia created by typical Bollywood commercial movies, where justice is served at the end, the bad guys are punished, and everyone lived happily ever after. The consequence of Aswin also reminds you that working for good and being honest no more brings good nowadays. It's a saddening movie, but it's also thought-provoking. The making and acting of the movie was overall good. You will feel anger, helplessness, anxiety, curiosity through the movie with the continuous storyline."
" Sticks to point
",0.0,0.7798,2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,This movie made on the shocking double homicide that was sensational in India. But this movie sticks to facts and doesn't show sympathy to any suspects and it's made on neutral ground that's the point I liked and film is well executed and really a great film
" Almost a perfect 10
",0.5279,0.9912,2020-12-16 00:00:00,9,"Excellent movie, perfectly makes use of the famous Rashomon Effect and everything. The story is well told from each perspective, perhaps a tinge of bias to one of them, but that's excused as creative freedom. It's not a documentary, after all, even though it feels like one for the most part. That is also why it loses out on a perfect score. The makers had to invent new names for everyone it started to feel like fiction in certain places. I'd still strongly recommend this movie, however. As a standalone work of art, it is a splendid creation."
" Great great great.....engaging movie totally..fantastic
",0.8481,0.2481,2020-12-12 00:00:00,10,"Still case not solved? What a shame!
What's wrong with Indian police?police should help it"
" WHY bother ?
",-0.34,-0.39,2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"Really cannot understand the good critics.Boring , slow, stupid acting.. managed to see the first 45 minutes. I closed the movie and saw a documentary about whales. It was far more interesting and quick than the movie. DO NOT BOTHER on seeing it. DO NOT believe the good ratings."
" Irfan Khan is ðŸŒŸ
",0.0,0.9264,2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"The movie is based on a real life event and the case remains unsolved yet the movie tried to gain audience's sympathy towards the parents.
Irfan Khan as usual is amazing!If we set aside the facts about what happened in real life, then the movie is very good, definitely worth watching."
" Excellent plot and very well filmed
",0.7264,0.905,2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,I didn't know this was based on a true mystery but it is an excellent movie. I don't speak the language but with subtitled it was still very enjoyable
" Scariest Hindi movie..
",0.0,-0.9598,2020-09-16 00:00:00,9,"Apart from the storyline, the performances of the director, scriptwriter and actors, what stayed with me was how scary this entire matter was. The incompetence of government officials is not something that we are unaware of, but when it results in incorrect convictions of innocent individuals that are already suffering from the horrifying manner of the death of their only child, it generates a disturbed feeling that stays with you longer than any silly movie that calls itself horror.Move aside, Conjuring and Insidious and Ring and Fridays and slashers and zombies. *This* is genuinely terrifying, in the ""it could so easly happen to me"" mould. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of this gem."
" Hypothetical Drama
",0.0,0.4853,2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,Its just Ego factor that leads to utter failure. Two officers who r responsible for their actions gives us horrible fluctuations. This movie is more like a documentary. I wish it was solved. Gripping story with Non linear Screenplay makes it interesting. Climax is awful. Highly recommended. Must watch.
" SUSPENSE GLORY.
",0.5423,0.4091,2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Top class acting by Irfan Khan. So thrilling and disturbing. Great investigative drama and conspiracy thriller. The pacing is intense, the treatment of plot with 3 different investigations makes for an interesting retelling. Most shocking part of the movie was hpw things ended."
" Talvar
",0.0,-0.0346,2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie based on true events that who killed a14years old girl. The acting of Imran Khan was excellent and he performed naturally. This was one of the best crime investigation movie that moves slow but it doesn't make viewers get bored. More than a film it will make us an unexplained fell in our heart at end. A must watch movie, don't miss this."
" Absolutely brilliant.
",0.624,0.5994,2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,"One of Hindi cinema's finest thrillers, featuring a brilliant central performance from one of Hindi cinema's finest actors."
" Khan really was the best...
",0.0,-0.4939,2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Talvar is a solid, engaging murder mystery that works as reminder that America doesn't have a monopoly on troubled justice systems. CINEMATIC PET PEEVE: Has there ever been a character in a movie who says, ""It's an open-and-shut case,"" that isn't eventually proved to have been grossly incorrect?"

" Dont get the points
",0.0,-0.8276,2020-04-01 00:00:00,3,"Without knowing the true story, this film is garbage.
The script seems writed by a 12 years old. Some parts seems incredible long. Some just dont make sense. There are side stories that are completely unrelevant to the main story. Its not entertaining at all
Indian police its really this incompetent? They all jump to conclusion based on absolutely nothing and without any common sense."
" Lively Conducted
",0.4404,0.9022,2020-02-11 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful movie. Real incident based. Beautiful direction, Flawless Acting by everyone and master screenplay."
" Propaganda movie supporting parents
",0.2263,-0.9312,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,After watching this movie I was convinced that it was the servant's friend who must have done it based on what they showed as narco analysis in the movie. I watched the video of his narco analysis on youtube right after watching the movie and the actual video shows nothing of that sort that he had killed her. I was so angry at the movie writer and whoever else supported it. Trying to blame a poor man for no reason other than that he is poor and not as valuable in their eyes. He should file a case.
" Good one
",0.4404,0.9325,2019-12-09 00:00:00,7,Acting and Dialogue delivery are the best in movie we can feel the movie all is about Imagination of a person in there point of view camera work is good color grading is good climax is natural like a normal and Real
" Excellent movie as a replacement of New Channel
",0.5719,-0.0364,2019-04-01 00:00:00,3,"If this is excellent movie from all technical aspects, why so low score? Only because I watch movies as an escape from the real world. I read and watch CNN or other news channels for the real world. Until last 10 minutes, I had a score of 10 in my mind and then the movie took me from the imaginary world into the real world and the imaginary world broke into pieces"
" Talvar
",0.0,0.9691,2019-03-21 00:00:00,9,Excellent Movie. Everybody acted very well in the movie especially Irrfan Khan. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. The movie has no unwanted scenes. In the 1st half the movie went more interesting than 2nd half because it lagged a bit in 2nd half. BGM in the movie was also very good. The movie had a good story. Excellent Movie.
" Not boring but ....
",0.1232,0.9441,2018-12-10 00:00:00,7,"This film is a great attempt to engage the audience but there is something , something really missing or I didn't feel. .. Overall , I'm giving this 7/10 (which is actually good ..not best). Don't wanna spoil the film . A great thriller !!!"
" PERFECT MADE! MUST WATCH!
",0.6467,0.886,2018-10-07 00:00:00,10,"The Direction Of Meghna Gulzar Is stunningly great with the amazing work with actors like Irfan Khan, Neeraj Kabi, Konkona Sen Sharma, and others ."
" A classic example of using the power of television
",0.0,-0.6486,2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,Talvaar is an example of how to fool and sway the public's opinion and getting away with murder. All you need is money and connections. Rest the world will believe anything on the telly.We have murderes roaming free.
" An engaging and gripping take on a sad incidence!
",-0.2481,0.9809,2018-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: The story portrays an incidence that occurred in Noida in year 2008. It involved murder of thirteen year old girl Aarushi Talwar and same family's 45 year old servant Hemraj Banjade. The essence of portrayal of true stories lies in the research carried out before their execution. More than that, I feel this movie is so much appreciated by critics because of the names associated.The only thing that was highlighted but not followed in the movie can be summed into statement - ""it is better to release 10 guilty people than punish a single innocent person"". If that would have been followed as the truth was not known, story would have gained one more point from me. Yes the movie is that good.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is Meghna Gulzar's best work as a director till date (yes it is better than Raazi). Other factors are justified as well. Music: Average. Acting: Very good.Final Verdict: It is an engaging and gripping take on a sad incidence, you will cherishing watching."
" Outstanding!!! just give it a try.
",0.7074,0.9392,2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,I have never watched a movie like this. The direction of the movie was superb all credits to Meghna gulzar for giving us such a wonderful film and irrfan khan was as always giving gossebumps with his acting and my favourite Neeraj kabi just stunning.
" Frightening & Powerful!!
",-0.2462,-0.1513,2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie will shake your beliefs on our system. The first reaction that came to my mind after watching this film is that we finally made something at par of Korean movie Memories of Murder or Hollywood movie JFK. As a Music Composer, as a Film Director or as Writer Vishal Bhardwaj has proved time and time again why he is one of finest Craftsman/Creator of this era. Superb Performances from all cast. Hats off to Meghna Gulzar & Team for making this film. It's easily one of the most hard hitting film of our times."
" Lack in climax
",-0.3182,-0.8126,2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,I was bit unhappy as they couldn't find who is the exact murderer
" I would have preferred a documentary
",0.0,-0.8049,2018-01-24 00:00:00,5,"If you compare this to a regular mainstream hindi flick, its Citizen Kane. If you compare this to inspired-by-real-life thriller/dramas... then it flawed, unnecessary and anti-climatic.The movie tries, but ends up neither a who-dunnit, nor a social commentary, nor a movie that exposes corruption, nor does it sheds light on anything shocking.The movie is based on a botched investigation of a famous double murder. 
The investigation aspect shown in the movie is flawed. Even a regular audience member can point out mistakes and assumptions being portrayed as evidence that no one could think of. The corruption/botched up investigation aspect is lightly touched upon. Then there is a parallel track of Irrfan and Tabu's separation which seems completely unnecessary and idiotic. It does not symbolize anything related to the story and looks absurd.Performances are fine. Indian cinema has definitely produced such close-to-real-life now and then, so this isnt anything special. Irrfan Khan is a splendid actor who doesnt need my vote. But this seems like a cakewalk role for him. It couldve been portrayed by anybody. In fact, he looks like a caricature of his usual self. Konkona is another fabulous actress. But her character doesnt have anything special to do in the movie. That too couldve been portrayed by anybody. Seems more insulting to the genre and serious cinema if you take known actors to sell your movie.I wouldve preferred a thoroughly researched documentary than this."
" Very good suspense detective crime movie
",-0.079,0.9365,2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Okay, it was difficult for me to watch Indian movie again. Last I watched Indian movie was like 8 years ago, 3 Idiots. I always have this prejudices toward Indian movies. Lately, I've been craving for suspense or thriller genre movies. I watched a lot in the last 2 years. Then my friend suggested me to watch Talvar, an Indian movie. I literally watched this movie because my friend swear on it. And damn, he was right.Talvar is a very good investigation movie. The pace is medium enough, and we were showed how Indian police work and how CDI, the elites, work. The story is intriguing, the acting is superb, and the depiction of real life is so detail and moving.I like this movie, because I felt like I'm in the middle of the investigation. I am surprised that the case is from real life. Wow.Now, I have a plan to watch some others Indian movies such as Kahaani, A Wednesday, and Byomkesh. I think I will fall hard for Indian movies again."
" Over the Top, and worst enact of a True story
",-0.128,0.7297,2017-06-15 00:00:00,3,"I have read the Arushi murder case and heard about the 2 movies that came. This one and Rahasya. I had a chance to see Rahasya when it was aired on TV and I saw only 30 min of it. Later I couldn't and I made a mental note to see both these movies when I got a chance. I got the chance to watch Talvar last weekend when it came on TV and I saw it in one go.I read it here that this movie is like rashomon in terms of story telling.That made me watch it even more and boy I was tricked. I hate that line. I don't know if it was a publicity gimmick or cheap fact but Rashomon ???? If that is written by the movie team for publicity then its an insult to the cult rashomon.I don't have to tell the plot or the other relevant items as we all know about it, but I will tell why the movie sucked !!!Once again, as with lots or I would say most of the genres, Bollywod cannot make a genuine movie without adding the masala into it: We cant stick to the bare bones of a true incident and have to add cheap cliche's masala to sell itWhy was even Tabu in the movie with the divorce sub plot with irfan khan? Just to buy some time and increase the length and add a sense of personality to irfan's character. Well it sucked and just took the mind off from the already boring narrativeWhy did we had to bear songs ( in the BG ) but why?The aarushi murder case itself was pumped with emotions and suspense and drama, which handled well could have been thrill of a lifetime but no, Director needs to add all the jazz to spice it up and in the end it left a bland tasteThe screenplay and edit was illogical and vague for the most part if he was trying to create rashomon effect which by the way was not even miles nearIf you have seen rashomon, you can feel every word, scene and the way it seamlessly flows on the screen to capture the 3 perspectives of the same story and doesn't leave a gap or a moment for us to breathe outTalvar does exactly the opposite, its just 1 level up than Crime Patrol but Crime patrol on Sony is hell better in retaining suspense and making it enjoyable. Talvar was just a power-point presentation with some good actors and sub plots thrown in at randomVery disappointed, and considering the stars here on IMDb, I can feel how easy it is to get better ranking in Bollywood movies. It doesn't deserve more than 6 stars, but people in reviews are praising it like anything which is sad. I am sure most of them have not seen rashomon or other movies that create, maintain, thrill and evoke drama and emotions from the audiences when we have such a topic.Most of the scenes in the movies were dramatically enforced to the audience that ""wanted"" to show what is being done. and most of it was irritating as the cop who came to investigate for the first time. Deliberate attempt to show that the investigation was botched up and it looked naive. I have seen police investigation in India and I know they are not top quality but in this movie they wantedly made them look like jokers and it was irritating.Irfaan Khan was straight out from the Vodaphone Ad and just like in almost all movies, he had the same straight head expression.Its based on true events, so basically the makers had full option to make it RAW and Brutal as it was and ensure full grip over the presentation. But it wasn't, It had all good actors for sure but the presentation was too naive and amateurish. highly disappointing and the ending was too hurried and simple. We all know the ending but still it was far from perfection for an adaption. Need to wait for a few more decades to get a good True story movie to be made in Bollywood. Watch Crime Patrol instead, you wont be disappointing anyone !!"
" A story may have many versions, but this story has only one.
",0.0,0.9826,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie is based on true story of what happened in Aarushi Talvar's murder case. It is a beautifully orchestrated movie which shows the deep realities of functioning of police administration in India.Other than the story part of this movie, which is at focus here, Direction is great. Vishal and Gulzar have done a tremendous job to get the best out of all the actors in this movie. Acting is simple and superb. Irfan Khan has time and again showed us how powerful an simple act can be.Now to the story part, All that is needed to know what actually happened in this case is common man's logic and official statements from court, police etc.You know Who is a caged parrot? CBI That's who. And these are not my words, these are words of Supreme Court of India. The law regulating CBI is structurally flawed and it is deliberately so. We need separation of CBI from Parliament and politicians like in U.S., if we want any positive change.India needs more movies like these."
" An eye-opening thriller, extremely well executed murder mystery
",-0.4889,0.34,2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"A wonderfully conceptualized murder mystery putting an eye-opening twist on the careless investigative methods of some Indian police personnel. Ashwin Kumar (Played by Irrfan Khan) is called in to investigate as part of the central investigation bureau, with the politics in bureaucracy obstructing justice to the verge of ridiculing every theory on the sensational double-murder case of noida. An absolute masterpiece by Meghna Gulzar, with stellar performances by every cast member."
