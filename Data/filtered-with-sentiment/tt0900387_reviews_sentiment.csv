" Over familliar
",0.0,0.024,2020-12-30 00:00:00,5,"The story of 'Suite Francaise' has overtones of Captain Corelli, as it focuses on the complex relationships between the women of an occupied country (in this case France) and their occupiers. The novel it is based on was actually written during the war by a French woman who did not survive it, and discovered and published only many decades later. Unfortunately, the film is rather flat, and feels morally simplified. The use of English throughout obscures any differences in local culture that might have enriched the over-familliar resistance v Nazis narrative, while Kristen Scott-Thomas is wasted, not for the first time, by being cast in the role of mean hag (the two heroines, needless to say, are both young and conventionally pretty). The closing credits, revealing the story of the story, were more interesting to me than the tale itself."
" I will be personal here. Matthias Schoenaerts is born for romance movie.
",0.5574,-0.2846,2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"His eyes can express sorrow, longing, passion, and vulnerability at the same time. I understand he is a Nazi official, but the chemistry between Lucille and Bruno gives me butterfly in the stomach, and I become a hopeless romantic. The story development of French's independent movement and the ending ended in a little hurry, but overall every scene of the movie is written 'romance' all over because of color and lighting."
" Immy's review : Criminally underrated
",0.0,0.9352,2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"This was a captivating account of a woman's struggle to live in German occupied France, and ultimately falling in love with a German officer staying at her house. The movie excellently portrayed the destruction of the french people's moral and their livelihoods, consequently turning on one another and hiding secrets. The romance aspect was very sweet, as we see both lead characters battling with their morality and pressures to not associate with the enemy, evoking complex and often unrequited feelings. The music was absolutely beautiful and emphasised the feelings of horror, love and tragedy. Overall, this movie had an interesting plot, great performances and some solid characters. My main fault lies with the ending, which I felt was rather rushed, and I would've liked to have seen more closure to each of the characters. This movie wasn't perfect, but it's definitely underrated and well worth a watch. Highly recommend!"
" Speaks to the Complexity of Nazi Occupation in France
",0.0,0.4671,2020-05-07 00:00:00,9,"Seventy years after the Second World War, powerful new books and films are still being made about the brutality and heroism of ordinary people forced to make unimaginable life-and-death choices. ""Suite Francaise"" is one of them. In this case the citizens of a captive town in Vichy France risk their lives to defy the Nazi occupation. There is a love story here, but it serves only as a reminder that decisions are made by individuals, and those decisions cannot be easily dismissed as collaboration or heralded as heroism."
" I found the romance dull, the plot hackneyed
",0.2263,-0.6643,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The backstory of ""Suite Francaise"" the book is far more compelling than the movie itself. Written by a Jewish woman who lost her life in the Holocaust, her manuscript was discovered and published by her surviving daughter decades later. However, this movie lacks passion, and the premise has been covered by other, better films before. However, ""Suite Francaise"" has several well-known, likable stars (Michelle Williams, Matthias Schoenerts, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Margot Robbie, MIchelle Monaghan), and captures the look and feel of the early WWII period well. Despite her superior acting skills, I felt that the most glaring weakness of this film was Williams. She seemed to have no chemistry with her co-star. I found her performance too withdrawn and dull, and she looked frumpy and dull. I couldn't bring myself to care too much about her. Despite her acting skills, I felt she was miscast. Schoenerts' character was far more compelling as a conflicted German officer, a talented composer before the war, who desperately tries to cling to his humanity in a perilous time, when the world around him is literally going mad. I would have rather seen an entire film about his character than hers."
" When the Enemy Lives Among You
",-0.5423,-0.7032,2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"The first time I saw this film, I was disappointed. It was not the book. In fact, it was only one small slice of the book. But perhaps life is not given to a film just to make the book all over again. And the slice that was taken is very well done. The many tensions between characters, being allowed to see both the good and the bad and the weak and the strong in human beings, on all sides of the battle, the many hard choices and decisions they are forced to make, can be both riveting and thought provoking. I find myself asking, what would I be like living during such a time? Who would I be? (and I really hope never to find out)"
" Une affaire du coeur avec une conscience....
",0.0,-0.7362,2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,"I was pretty disappointed by this rather bland depiction of life in France immediately following their capitulation to the Nazis. The story centres around three women who must adapt as best they can to the billeting of young troops in their village and in their homes. Needless to say, some ""collaborate"" more readily than others; some seek to defy the new order - but all convey well that they are in peril for their lives as we are exposed to both the delicate and violent sides of their new occupiers. Kristen-Scott Thomas (herself a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur) and Margot Robbie deliver strong, poignant, characterisations as do Dame Harriet Walter as the ""Viscomtesse"" and Matthias Schoenaerts as the German Lieutenant ""Bruno"" - a former composer who demonstrates that a decency does exist amongst their enemy; one that captivates Michelle Williams (""Lucile""). I am not a fan of Williams' style of acting; I usually find her distant and remote - and here, too, is no exception. Fortunately, though, there is more than enough depth elsewhere to compensate. It is not a straightforward love story; well not just, anyway - it demonstrates clearly the extent to which compromise - however implemented - was essential for all in these dangerous times. The writing is taut, the photography has a keen eye for the detail and although it can appear just a little too perfect at times, is well worth an hour and half of your time to imagine how we might all have dealt with our enemies on our doorsteps - or even closer - day by day."
" Devastating
",-0.6486,-0.9672,2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"The story is almost unbelievable not because there couldn't be love stories between the Germans and French because there were at no surprise. But because it's hard to believe the much too obvious love affair could have been tolerated by the two enemy camps. Matthias S is devastating in his rendition as only him can be, I felt physically hurting the more the movie was going on towards its crushing end.. Michelle Williams is behind him, I can't figure out why it hasn't been cast a French actress,, say Berenice Bejo ( ok, she's not French :)) or someone else, dunno).I didn't read the book but read a review, it seems the movie has got far from the book which I don't like. Or maybe we sould take it as a different story, one by itself and that's it.Well done, Matthias S, always a pleasure to see you!"
" Masterpiece with impressionist and bovarist influences
",0.7269,0.9969,2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,"As an historian I watch a lot of historical movies with a critical eye. But in this case I was astonished by the way this movie depicts the beginning of the occupation of Western Europe during WW2. From a slice of life perspective you can see how every part of society is confronted with the new political order. The scenario does not make the obvious mistake of portraying the German soldiers and the collaboration with them as a black and white story. You can see the many shades of gray (forgive me) that that arise from an occupation of a foreign region and how society as a whole as well as all its individuals has to cope with it. For example the Viscount who collaborates with the German authorities and in the act tries to protect his citizens as well as preserving his pre-war privileges. This way of telling the story of a whole society nearly approaches the academic method of Emannuel le Roy Ladurie in his acclaimed 'Montaillou'. Most of this praise must go to the author of the book, Irène Nemirovsky, who provided us with a quasi objective novel with clear inspiration of Gustave Flauberts' masterpiece Madame Bovary in times of conflict.But apart from the historical accuracy 'Suite française' is a masterpiece both for the eye and the heart. The storyline develops very smoothly with a few moments of high tension which show the harsh reality of war and occupation, with the soothing love story between Lucille Angellier (Michelle Williams) and Bruno von Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts) at the centre. Not the clichéd 'forbidden love' is shown as usual, but a tense and tactile tale with many layers. The other stories are also worth following because they are not pushed to the side but are nicely blended through the connections with the three main characters. The cinematography and the setting are for me personally beyond perfect. They suck you completely in the movie and show you a picturesque French countryside with scenes and colors that remind you of impressionist paintings from Monet or Renoir.BUT the most important character of the movie is...the music. It's what brings Lucile and Bruno together and is connects the high the culture which the French and the Germans have, that became extremely polarized during the war. The music played by the characters in the movie blends perfectly in with the wonderful soundtrack. Each scene is accompanied by the haunting music and connects the different stage of the story together with a harmonical entity as a result.For the accurate depiction of wartime, the non-biased characters, the exquisite cinematography and scenery and especially the soundtrack: a well deserved 9."
" Very Good! NOT a foreign film
",0.54,0.9665,2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"I think the downfall of this movie is its title. It sounds like a foreign film. I say ""downfall"" because I had never even heard of it and just stumbled across it. Yet it's a pretty sweeping historical war drama/romance with two pretty big actors in it. There are a lot of sub-stories and thus I think it would have worked even better as a limited series, and I would have appreciated even more time to develop the romance of the main characters. That said, I really liked it and it's one of the better films I've seen in the last several months. Romantic, dramatic, suspenseful."
" So human, watch to see the very essence of being human..!
",0.0,0.9875,2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,"Its a must watch. I had no expectations or any sort of idea about the background of this movie,but i was pleasantly surprised.
This movie shows that how when humans are looked closely and compared to each other, you will be shocked to discover that they all are made of the same element , deep down the flesh , our emotions, our needs as humans, our sufferings, duties, morals, feelings are all same despite the differences in skin, race,language and culture..we are all one.. it shows that how our hearts if given the chance,would strike a similar symphony and this movie only shows how two humans bound to resent each other or meant to have no emotional connection, tend to fall in love, through the language of kindness and musical notes, love is the very essence of being human, it is the most simple thing about us as complex beings, its drives us towards passion and makes us move away surprisingly from our initial motives, the deviation from the essence of love is hatred..which not only separates us physically but creates a chaos in our so called ideologies, the characters here belong to different ideologies but they are one as a human.
The main characters in this movie are so subtle , so real that they actually come to life on your screen ( despite the fact i watched it on a small screen- laptop) , you tend to get goosebumps equally both on their pain and their passion, the actors are remarkable and their chemistry is so lively.
Matthias Schoenaerts is an absolute gem, he comes with an air of mistrust and gentleness that sweeps you over and makes you fall hard for him, for he is as human as any one of us can be, in that ""duty"" uniform, as he says in the movie "" i am supposed to be the one people are afraid of"" and yet he is so approachable and kind. Michelle has done a great job in showing her character development, starting as an obedient submissive daughter-in-law but soon she rises above herself, becomes assertive in the matters of heart, passion and finally when it comes to her moral/ social duties , this movie is a must watch..its touches somewhere deep,- makes you feel empty in the last few minutes..but thats how great things are..they leave an impact."
" A with passion written war movie...
",-0.2263,0.9694,2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is fine piece of art when it comes down to filming and characters. I love the colors, the scenery, the vehicles, the clothing and all the actors who are part of this mind-blowing production. When you like piano you certainly fall in love with soundtrack the way I do, it's absolutely beautiful. If you love war movies this is clearly a film you have to watch from my perspective."
" Could be better
",0.4404,0.5267,2019-07-06 00:00:00,4,"This is a great story. However, so many details are left out that would've made the story much more compelling. Also very depressing."
" The Real War Vicitms Deserve Better Than This Cliche-fest
",-0.25,-0.9669,2019-06-22 00:00:00,3,"Didn't you just know that polite, sensitive non-Nazi German officer was going to sit down at the piano and start playing sad classical music? Or that he and the trembling young French wife were going to be justified in their gasping grappling by the revelations of her having been forced to marry an adulterer she didn't love and of the misty-eyed officer's having been married to a girl he'd immediately left behind and could now, conveniently, barely remember? Wasn't it clear in this pseudo-memoir that all the Germans (except the Good German, of course) would insist on speaking, or rather barking, German while the French would persist in speaking English? Were you at all surprised by the stereotyped evil mother-in-law who enjoyed tormenting her daughter-in-law and grinding down her war-ravaged tenants? And did you suspect that the initially bedraggled, abused, and saintly Cinderella would morph from swooning collaborator into unstoppable resistance heroine, never getting caught in her most feckless feats by the barking, incompetent occupiers? Were you troubled by the irony that by shielding the peasant she was endangering the whole community (particularly the kindly but Vichy-like Viscount), her family, and her morose lover, who somehow showed up at just the right moment to save not only her but the man who had killed his comrades? Did you remember that love conquers"" uber alles"" as demonstrated when (we are told) the collaborator-turned-superpatriot goes on to help defeat the Nazis war machine? Are you surprised that I give the filmmakers 3 points for some nice shots of French provincial countryside but subtract seven points for their disservice to the real war victims by offering up a slapdash, formula war romance that is almost Hallmarkian in its simplistic artificiality."

" Beautiful story of the times!
",0.636,0.9507,2019-04-09 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely love this story. It's a marvelous and beautiful story during a tragic and sad time of the war. Michelle Williams does excellent, I love the different languages used which enhances the realism!It would've been 10 stars for me, had the ending been more completed, despite the book. I wanted Atleast some form of an ending. Otherwise amazing film!"
" Fabulous and Beautiful Fim
",0.8074,0.9114,2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This film has a beautiful soundtack that doesn't overwhelm the scenes, stunning photography, fabulous acting and everything awesome. Based on an unfinished series of books by Irene Nemirovsky, a Ukrainian Jew who died in Auschwitz yet held enough love in her heart to write this story about love across cutures and across war.My only complaint - and it is a big one LOL is missing precious minutes of the film due to subtitles in German not English - but that may be just the version I watched."
" A rare and exciting wartime love story
",0.8126,0.9787,2019-01-10 00:00:00,10,"If you've seen Schindler's List then you may have had a notion that what one was seeing is likely very close to the reality. Even though this is historical fiction, I got the same sense with this movie. I love war movies, but I'm not a fan of love stories. It didn't matter. There's no running along beaches into each other's arms at sunset here. And it's exciting all the way through. Honestly, there was never a dull moment. The cast were extraordinary, the casting was extraordinary. The attention to detail so professional. I was transported. The soundtrack was full of deep reflective depth. It would be impossible to not come away from this movie without a real appreciation of what occupation means. A wonderful success."
" Well crafted, realistic WW2 drama
",0.2732,0.9925,2018-12-30 00:00:00,7,"A realistic romance drama that begins with a non original romantic plot but after the first hour we get to know the characters and the plot grows strong, amazing. The author never got to finish her novel because of the holocaust but I believe it would have been a masterpiece and the movie is one great WW2 drama. They show the different perspectives, it's believable and has a deep story. The acting is fine, could have been better but the overall production helped. They succeeded in having that dark atmosphere that war has and the loss of hope. The twists and turns are what makes it an interesting movie and the true realism about it, recommended."
" Definitely gonna watch it over and over
",0.4019,0.6013,2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,This movie i know that i wouldn't just watch it one time and forget about it. It's very well sad and romantic and with superb soundtrack.
" Good though less inspiring than the book
",0.6605,0.9006,2018-10-10 00:00:00,7,"During the German occupation of France in World War 2, a small French town is turned upside down as Nazi officers are billeted in the residents' homes. Among the various stories, the one most highlighted involves a young married woman (Michelle Williams) whose husband is away at war, her overbearing rich mother-in-law (Kristen Scott Thomas) who has an arrogant streak, and a handsome Nazi officer (Matthias Schoenhaerts) who is artistic and shows more humanity than one would expect. The film is based on one of the short stories in the novel by Irène Némirovsky.Némirovsky's novel itself is brilliant. Likewise, the circumstances of its creation are so astounding that they could be the subject of another film. The writer, a French Jew, wrote it with the intention of having five related short stories. Only two were written before she was captured and murdered by the Nazis. Her partial manuscript was left in a trunk and was discovered by her daughters in 1997 and published in 2004.The intense and immediate mood of the book isn't fully felt in the film. While such an adaptation would be difficult, a more clever and unique direction might have helped. Director Saul Dibb does a competent job though less inspirational than one might have expected for the novel's fans. The decision to film in the English (rather than French) language is also questionable though for the most part, it does pay off as the story is so unique and rich.So, despite the unfulfilled expectations, this is still a respectable film."
" Days later I can't stop thinking about this movie
",0.2235,0.9916,2018-10-07 00:00:00,10,"Up until this point, Pride and Prejudice (Keira Knightley version) has been my favorite movie of all time, but this movie competes for the number one spot. I absolutely love the historical romance genre, but I'm a little picky in that it HAS to keep my interest. There are some highly recommended historical romance movies out there that just aren't what they're cracked up to be. This movie is not like that. This movie has me still thinking about it days later, and I'm about to watch it again for the second time in less than a week. It's well developed, the actors/actresses play their parts wonderfully, and it puts an interesting perspective on the people of the time. Please give this movie a watch."
" Believable characters and depiction of WW2.
",0.0,0.6744,2018-09-19 00:00:00,10,"I was expecting a British style pace but the film did pick up its pace. Besides that sorta slow beginning, the accuracy to period I could not fault. It blew me away, and stayed my patience. The restraint of the characters relative to those times was also impressive.A film I could believe in; characters I could believe in; and the accurate depiction of those times, hence a definite 10/10."
" Beautiful war drama and love story
",0.6369,0.9442,2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"This is a truly beautiful, remarkable film, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is a war drama as well as a love story. The love story felt very natural (and very possible) and I rooted for both characters, being from completely different backgrounds. It's really sad and unfortunate that war and nationality divided people (and still does). Love is an unstoppable feeling from deep inside and this film portrays it so well.Kristin Scott Thomas steals the show with her brilliant acting! The entire cast was very good, and I loved the photography and cinematography as well. I couldn't help but wonder how many times the scenario depicted in the film played off in real life..."
" Much Better Than Expected
",0.4404,0.9765,2018-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Watched this not expecting much but was pretty much engrossed throughout. Story is not complex but runs pretty deep tackling the undercurrents very well. I have not read the book to compare so cannot comment in that resprect but after recently watching ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" can only recommend this as a vastly superior film in all respects."
" Not terrible but it could have been so much better!
",0.7458,-0.858,2018-03-20 00:00:00,6,"I feel like I've seen this story many times before in film. However, on the plus side, Kristin Scott Thomas is on brilliant form as the Mother-in-Law from hell Madame Angellier. You may not like her but you begin to understand her and eventually have some empathy for her. Sam Reilly and Ruth Watson are also extremely watchable as Benoit and Madeleine Labarie. Unfortunately, Alexandra Maria Lara, probably best known as Hitler's secretary in Downfall (parts of which are now mercilessly parodied on YouTube), is sadly underused in this film. Unfortunately, Michelle Williams is woefully miscast as our 'heroine' Lucile Angellier. Williams fails to breathe any life into a character who finds herself trapped in an loveless, arranged marriage. Meanwhile, Matthias Schoenaerts, a wonderful actor, seems distinctly ill at ease as Lieutenant Bruno von Falk. I found their scenes together unconvincing, lacking in chemistry and rather awkward.All in all, not a terrible way to spend a couple of hours, but this film is unlikely to trouble the all time classic films depicting WWII."
" Suite is a Sweet film
",0.4588,-0.7906,2018-03-18 00:00:00,7,"About the human side of war seen from both camps, the oppressor and the oppressed Michele Williams is as normal quite mesmerising to watch, and an atmospheric performance from Schoenaerts."

",-0.5994,-0.8126,2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"This adaptation of a newly discovered manuscript that was turned into a novel in 2004 is set during the German occupation of France in the 1940's. German soldiers were billeted in the homes of the locals in the village of Bussy.Lucille Angellier (Michelle Williams) lives with her wealthy and domineering mother in law, Madame Angellier (Kristin Scott Thomas.) Each Sunday they would stealthily collect rent from the tenant farmers on their land. Lucille's husband is away fighting, thought now to be a prisoner of war.The Angellier household is joined by handsome, cultured German officer, Bruno (Matthias Schoenaerts) a musician before he became a soldier.Both are attracted to each other in a village where the war has complicated things. Madame Angellier remains a patriot having little to do with the Germans but still sees an opportunity to make money.Some of the women sleep with the German soldiers in a village that was deprived of men. Some of the wealthy people in the village like the Viscount manage to carry on regardless by keeping their chickens, rooms and power. Others suffer especially as some of the villagers settle scores by gossiping to the Nazis by writing poisonous letters.Lucille feels hell bent to help out one of her tenant family who is being harassed by a Nazi officer, willing to take risks.This is a handsomely mounted film well acted by Scott Thomas and Williams. The story is not deep, Bruno is not regarded as a token good Nazi. He is willing to overlook the actions of what some of his fellow officers may have done in the past but his feelings for Lucille seems genuine."

" Predictable, but enjoyable
",0.5927,0.6453,2017-08-02 00:00:00,6,"Reading the synopsis already gives the directions to the movie; not much of a surprise to me, to be fairly honest. The disposition of characters and their personalities are very well known in romantic fiction.However, it is still a intriguing and beautiful movie. You can enjoy the marvelous landscapes of France and Belgium countrysides. Though predictable, the dynamic of the main couple is delicate and makes you cheer for them. It also shows the civilian point of view of war, far from the battle camps, but still a painfully one.This movie gave me exactly what I wanted and expected. A forbidden and almost cheesy romance that's not your usual WWII movie."
" Sacharine Sweet costume drama
",0.4588,0.9956,2017-07-20 00:00:00,5,"Now I like a floral frock and a well-pressed Nazi uniform (on screen, you understand) as much as the next gal, but I do find the nostalgic framing of WWII in the movies a little troubling – and 'Suite Francaise' is no exception. The hand of the BBC is everywhere visible in the production, from the costumes to the doughty cast of characters who could have come straight from the set of 'Poldark' or 'Lark Rise to Candleford.Michelle Williams plays 'the beautiful Lucille' (as described by the BBC) and Matthius Schoenaerts gives Ralph Fiennes a run for his money as the brooding, handsome and 'refined' (BBC again) Nazi soldier, his refinement on show for all to see via his wistful tinkling on Michelle's, erm, piano.The two, entirely predictably, fancy the pants off each other (or should that be cami-knickers) and various complications ensue, what with him being a Nazi and everything. But the moral of the story is that lurv and that old-British-chestnut 'common decency' prevail, wresting some kind of happy ending from the film and – by extension – the Nazi occupation of France.The film is based on a recently discovered manuscript. Irène Némirovsky, an ultra-nationalist Russian Jew exiled in France, wrote the stories while living under German occupation. In that context 'Suite Francaise' can perhaps be understood as an attempt to humanise an implacable enemy, the natural desire to have love triumph – at least in the imagination. The real story is remarkable and could have made an interesting film, since Irene Nemirovsky's end was not happy and neither love nor common decency prevailed: like 6 million other European Jews she was ultimately betrayed by the people she lived amongst and sent to Auschwitz, where she died.The unending nostalgia for WWII, envisaged as a time of moral simplicities and endless heroism, airbrushes the reality: that millions of 'ordinary' people in every nation in Europe collaborated with the Germans and shared their distrust and hatred of the Jews, while the wealthy admired the Nazis as a bastion against the political left.When poverty comes through the door, the saying goes, love flies out the window. Ignorant hatred of Muslims, xenophobia and anti-semitism are stalking the streets of Europe once again. We should resist these cosy fables, that reduce WWII to a lush setting for romance, and face up to the less palatable realities of our shared past – which no amount of lipstick can gloss over.For a grittier, more complex, troubling and interesting exploration of similar themes see Louis Malle's 1974 film 'Lacombe Lucien.'"

The movie ruined it, it's very heavy handed and the actors can't save it, I felt like I was watching an other Hollywood movie. And I'm not even talking about the factual errors. No wonder it never made it to the big screen here!"

A feel of Romeo and Juliet, having two lovers being torn part from outside circumstances, although i will not give away the ending. The scenery and visuals were stunning. It reflected the history of the time so well with the vile behavior of the Nazis and the attitudes of the small-town folk. I just loved the whole story of it and it is something different from your other average romantic movie nowadays. Great casting for Suite Francaise, particularly Matthias Schoenaerts as the German soldier Bruno Van Falk. The sub-plot (if of one) of Celine and Benoit was thrilling and astounding, played by Margot Robbie and Sam Riley. I was really following the character's journeys throughout and rooting for them, hoping everything would work out okay for them. despite them being caught up in one of the world's most deadly of wars ever. I commend this movie and recommend it to everyone, especially history buffs, hoping you will enjoy it as much as I truly did."
" Impossible love stories do not get more impossible than this
",0.6369,0.9768,2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"At the beginning of WWII, a young married woman (Williams) and her mother in law (Scott Thomas) living in a village close to Paris, are forced to take in their house a German officer from the occupying forces (Schoenaerts).Scott Thomas is perfect as Madame Angellier, the icy mother in law with a twist. Williams and Schoenaerts are suitably reserved and understated as the star-crossed lovers. Sounds predictably tragic, but it is actually a very well made and interpreted movie. Also an engaging and believable love story, rather than a paint-by-number or a post-modern one.The supporting cast is equally good, with a bunch of inhabitants - from the local gentry to the lowest peasants - in conflict with each other and foolishly thinking they can exploit the nasty German occupants to settle personal scores.The melancholy of the story rings true, maybe because it is based on a novel written at the time of the events narrated. Definitely a refreshing experience in old-style storytelling – think ""Casablanca"", with slightly more gory details and less hope in the future of a beautiful friendship."
" Excellent FIlm
",0.5719,-0.846,2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"I was drawn to this film as I knew about Irene Nemirovska - that she had converted to Christianity but that did not save her and she died early on in Auschwitz. The first book which hardly features in this film ( strafing the column of refugees) details the flight of a bank and its personnel to Tours - actually the map is shown in the credit sequence. When I read it - it was exactly as my father described as he was caught and made a POW at Dunkirk. I recommend it to anyone to read. The story line of the film is well worth seeing - I saw it with a friend and after I went home he sat back for the rest .... Easily as good as The Black Book and WInter War. I thought it was very well crafted - the mayoress never says to the mayor ""what I did has led to your death"" but it was all poignantly acted. Lucille never confesses her love for Bruno.
It is a tragedy to watch."
" good support characters
",0.6808,0.8935,2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"It's 1940 and France is on the verge of falling. Lucile Angellier (Michelle Williams) lives with her mother-in-law Madame Angellier (Kristin Scott Thomas) who ruthlessly collects rent from her tenant farmers. Her husband along with many of the men are away at war. She befriends poor farmer Madeleine Labarie (Ruth Wilson) and her crippled husband Benoit (Sam Riley). As France is occupied, the villagers are forced to billet German officers. The Angelliers are assigned Bruno von Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts). He's been assigned to read through the letters written by the villagers ratting out each other. Madame Angellier evicts the Josephs and Celine Joseph (Margot Robbie) is bitter for being forced into the barn.I really like all the supporting characters in the village. The conflicting paths are compelling and the same character often have opposing modes. The central romance is less appealing. This requires Michelle Williams to lose her senses and fall in a full-on romance novel relationship. She does her best but a younger and more naive actress would probably work better. It should be a relationship of intense trust issues but the movie is driving for romanticism. It's really wrong-headed. There are also other minor issues about the third act."
" Deeply disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.7745,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Having just read the book for a book group, I looked forward to this. To describe it as a travesty would be too kind. I realise that films can't treat books literally, that they need to translate literary effects into cinematic ones, but this isn't the problem here. Rather it's that the subtleties of the book are ignored by a film which tramples on them with jackboots and despoils the central relationship for no obvious reason. It's a cruel insult to the grace and candour of Irene Nemirovsky, who died in Auschwitz without finishing what might have been the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Read the book instead."
