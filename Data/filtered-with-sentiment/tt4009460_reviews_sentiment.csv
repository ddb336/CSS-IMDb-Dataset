" Saving Christmas
",0.0,0.9435,2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,"I knew the negativity surrounding this Christmas film, including it being in the Bottom 100 list on IMDb, and on the Wikipedia page ""List of films considered the worst"". I didn't read much about the plot, I had my guesses what it would involve, I knew I had to watch to see why it was bad. Basically, the film opens with Kirk (Razzie winning Kirk Cameron) talking to the audience beside a fireplace, explaining his love of Christmas. He expresses his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, questioning if people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas, i.e. the Christian story of the birth of Christ, and that the holiday may have become overwhelmed by modern traditions. He explains that many see Christmas as an excuse to spoil kids, pretence and obligations, having perverted symbols with hidden meaning, a pointless distraction, and having needless spending, commercialism, he also mentions many believe it to be a worship for atheists, paganism and elf worship. It then switches to the main narrative, where Kirk attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. He notices that his brother-in-law, Christian (Darren Doane, also writing, producing, and directing), is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why, Christian tells Kirk that he feels the holiday became too commercialised and consumerist and mentions the Pagan elements. Kirk tells Christian he is wrong and recites the Nativity, seen in cartoon form. Meanwhile, Diondre (David Shannon) and another guest (Raphi Henley) discuss conspiracy theories. Kirk later finds Christian hiding in the car. Christian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees and Santa Claus, are not biblical in origin. Kirk tells the stories of why Christmas trees and Santa truly are in fact religious things. The trees were created by God, appearing in the Garden of Eden, that baubles on trees represent the fruit that Adam and Eve ate, and the lights on them can be seen as the light of God. Christian suggests the name ""Santa"" is an anagram of ""Satan"" and that he is not a Christian figure. However, Kirk explains that Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas, and was in fact a representative for God, giving presents for those who truly believed. Kirk also suggests that Jesus was brought into the world to die, that his gifts of frankincense and myrrh were given to be used in his burial, and that he was born and died in the same material. Reassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Kirk issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, ""for our children"". Then the guests perform a hip hop song and breakdance, set to ""Angels We Have Heard on High"". It ends with Kirk telling everyone to feast, suggests the audience organise the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget it is a celebration of God. Also starring Razzie nominated Bridgette Cameron as Kirk's Sister, and Ben Kientz as St. Nick. From the title, I thought this was going to be a simple predictable film about a guy ""saving Christmas"" in some kind of adventure, but I got nothing like that at all. If this is supposed to be funny, I wasn't laughing, I just found the film an excuse for Christian preaching. Almost the entirety of the film was ramming the Christian belief down our throats, and it felt really patronising also. I will admit the comparisons of Christian traditions to things in Christmas we recognise, and embrace was fairly interesting, but it doesn't make me want to recognise Christianity. The poppy version of Silent Night during the opening credits was fairly catchy as well. Obviously, I do recognise the birth of Jesus as being the origin of the holiday, but I just see Christmas as a fun time with the family, with good food, presents, decorations, songs, and films and TV. People should be allowed to celebrate Christmas however they want, and not have religion force-fed to them, and that is why I found this an annoying, unfunny and pointless seasonal comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay for Darren Doane and Cheston Hervey, and Worst Screen Combo for Kirk Cameron & His Ego, and it was nominated for Worst Director for Darren Doane. Poor!"
" Literally the worst thing I've ever seen.
",-0.6249,-0.4329,2020-12-23 00:00:00,1,"I watched this with a group of people who grew up evangelical and we are all now deconstructing from that type of religion. Needless to say, when watching this, a lot of alcohol and countless curse words were needed to get through. I felt like the whole movie was full of weird Christian conspiracies that I've never even heard of before (That bit about Adam having to give back the fruit he ate by Jesus being hung in a tree... what?). I actually was on the side of Christian at the beginning of the movie. He was the one who sounded sane of the two main characters (""Why waste all this money on a large tree and gifts that will stop being used in 3 weeks when that money could go toward starving children. Is this even the Christmas God wanted?"" Ya, ya I can agree with this). This whole movie was just wild from start to finish. I felt like I was losing my mind. Feel free to watch if you want to know what losing your mind feels like."

That was just as bad of this movie and trust me, that other was really really awful.I couldn't talk you which of these two films were the worst Christmas movie, but if IMDB had a zero rating, I would have given it for this movie."

Well, I found it interesting, and here is why. The evangelical Christian movement is excreting influence unlike any time in its history in our daily and political lives.

" Draining Christmas
",0.0,0.8175,2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"If you looked at the poster of Saving Christmas and expected a fun family action comedy featuring the actor from ""Growing Pains,"" get ready to be disappointed. Kirk Cameron, the formerly popular teen actor turned born-again Christian, is off to save Christmas and what does he do? He stalls inside a car with his brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane) and lectures to him and the audience about the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of Jesus. Saving Christmas is more about inflating Cameron's ego than spreading the holiday cheer to all your friends. Despite being a Christian, Cameron contradicts his own religious philosophy of love and forgiveness and suggests that Saint Nicholas, the originator of Santa Claus, murdered heretics when not giving presents. I guess Cameron was trying to be ironic with his ""Lord of the Ringsy"" take on the figure, but instead it comes off as mean-spirited, especially in a Christmas movie. To be fair, the joke might have worked in a tongue-and-cheek sense, if the other characters weren't so poorly-written. Christian is a one-dimensional Scrooge in the mud, the atheist conspirators contribute nothing and neither do any of the party-goers, including Kirk's sister Bridgette, except a dance number. Seeing the characters' lack of onscreen presence only adds to Kirk Cameron's overlong sanctimonious preachiness; that's me a film lover in general. If Kirk Cameron is reading this post (I seriously doubt that he is), I apologize for being a ""hater and atheist,"" but Saving Christmas wasn't very good.

",-0.6249,-0.8155,2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie is not only unfunny, the beliefs and suggestions of these characters is extremely questionable. This frantic Christian flick movie tries to connect Christmas to everything in the universe while using desperate humor. The actors (besides Kirk) feel like they were kidnapped in the middle of the night and forced to read lines. Throughout the film, Kirk supports violent examples and has a generally weird idealism. Despite it's slow tone and plot, the world of Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas is a frenzied religion obsessed dystopia."

" Holy roller, this is awful
",-0.4588,-0.9784,2020-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I think it's fair to say that the Scientologist have a better grasp on movie making, with the exception of Travolta's ""Battlefield Earth"" fiasco. But at least the Scientologist have the imagination to invent an entire new religion. While Cameron sticks with a book that's essentially ""Life lessons for the illiterate bronze age goat herder"". This movie is actually exemplifies a great example the mental state of a person who's lofty arrogance level is only matched by their ignorance, mixed with a volatile blend of complete and utter lack of self-awareness. This people, is why the evangelical prosperity business is worth billions in the US.
The pearl grasping ""war on Christmas"" diatribe trope is made even more intolerable with the absence of even a shred of the ""good stuff"" their imaginary savior was to have supposed to have preached to the first Christians. Nothing about helping the sick, and poverty stricken, it's all ""me me me me"". But what would you expect from a person who claims to have a direct communication with the omnipotent creator of the entire of everything? This movie, and the religion it advocates (as with all equally absurd religions), is and should always be open to ridicule. This should be the message anyone takes from this display of unsolicited sermon homily."

" Forever Changed The Meaning Of Christmas For Me
",0.0,0.9573,2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,I was a life long non-believer before watching this wholesome family holiday gem but Kirk Cameron lit my path and filled a hole. I had reached a point where I felt all of the holiday specials were drowned in commercialism and materialism and then one day I sat down while this happened to be playing on a television in the ward I was staying in and I realized that there lives a true Christmas angel - Kirk Cameron who really cares about all of us and that we enjoy Christmas his way rather than our own misguided ways. Thank you Kirk for filling the hole and I hope you can do the same for everyone else out there floundering through Christmas the wrong way! Does anyone know if there is a Kirk Christmas tree topper for sale anywhere rather than the traditional angel because Kirk is my angel all the way!
" great

" Full of good intention, it partly works

It ditches a stable for a cave - this adds to symbolism, though I suggest that Jesus' birth was in Joseph's parents' house.
A song cited says: ""so be good for goodness' sake"" - the mercenary ""so"" should be contrastive ""but"", so I flinch at this lyric. At least no anti-Christian ""Away in the Manger"" reference.
""Eternal god taking on a material body"". I dislike polytheistic language - no god-type, thank you very much. Moreover, better to specify God the son as having become human.
Santa Claus (Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas)) is depicted as an angry (orthodox) bishop beating the hell out of the heretic Arius at the C4 Council of Nicea: poetic amplification from a medieval folk-tale of Bishop Nicholas trying to slap some sense into a follower of Arius. In reality, Nicea probably had more freedom of speech than the BBC, really wished to hear Arius and other ideas, and probably Bp. Nicholas wasn't there.
An interesting take on Christmas trees as linking Genesis to Golgotha.
Arguably the film drags a fair bit (keep going at least the first 5 minutes), but some good acting and good fun sustains it, plus its invitation to at least rethink what the Christmas event really meant and means, even if we don't buy Kirk's take. Particulars aside, Kirk's generalisation is valid: instead of knocking the accrued tinsel of Christmas, see how they can point to deeper reality, but don't go singing to Christmas trees. A good hip-hop number at the end."
" The Ghost of Christmas Ass

" There's no reason for this movie to exist.
",-0.296,0.9863,2019-11-27 00:00:00,1,"Kirk Cameron had some success as a child actor. As he grew up however, and found religion, he moved away from the normal Hollywood fare and started making ""Christian"" movies. Now I don't care about any of that. If a movie has a Christian message it's fine so long as the movie is good. But this movie is far from good and just shows the utter drek that ""Christian"" movies tend to provide.The movie is supposed to provide a ""new"" understanding of Christmas and what it means. When you get down to it, it's a pagan holiday with all it's trappings that was co-opted by the early church. The people didn't care because they still got to party like they did before but instead of it being a celebration of the end of the year and a feast in honor of Saturn, it was now about Jesus. What we get instead is something that looks like a home movie and Kirk Cameron and the director sitting in a car for most of the run time and talking. Well it's more like Kirk lecturing to the other guy about the meaning of Christmas and injecting new information which the other guy just accepts as being true without questioning. Kirk even admits at some point that these stories are just that, they're just stories. But new stories in an attempt to change the way the holiday is seen. In a sense he's trying to rewrite history in order to match his personal views.Along the way there's some bad attempts at comedy here and there and, I kid you now, a 10 minute dance scene at the end that just feels like it was there to pad out the running time. And even then the movie is barely 80 minutes long.Rightfully this was savaged by the critics and the audience who saw it for what it was. And the most ironic thing is that Kirk actually asked Christians to go and rig the vote on ""Rotten Tomatoes"" to bump up the score whether they had seen the movie or not. That's right. Kirk was asking people to lie which, as far as I remember, is not something that his God looks too favorably upon. That was met with the Streisand Effect and if anything it drove the score even lower.This is a misguided movie in every sense of the word."

According to this, it is some holy reverence to buy the finest silver and linens rather than give any money to the poor. It frames Kirk as a hero for being Christ and making Christmas as selfish and greedy as possible.

That's a not inconsiderable accomplishment; even Edward D. Wood Jr. and Uwe Boll have made movies that didn't make you want to rush for the nearest bathroom. That's one more goal Kirk can shoot for. Unfortunately for him, he didn't reach it with this one.Inept at every conceivable level--and even at some that were previously inconceivable--I wouldn't recommend seeing this just for the laughs (there are plenty of them there, although it's not supposed to be a comedy--I don't think it is, anyway. It's hard to tell). It reminded me of what a friend of mine said not along after he got hit in the cojones by a line drive while playing baseball: ""It may have looked funny to you, but it hurt too much to laugh for me"".Now I know how he feels."

Good for him. It is important to know that this is essentially Christian/Christmas propaganda before you start watching. You will only want to watch this if you're an avid Christian hoping to trick your kids into watching a sermon, or if like me you love campy, awful films.This movie is abysmal. It's everything you want in a terrible film. It is essentially an 80 min excuse for Kirk to monologue and explain that everything that doesn't seem Christian at Christmas actually is.Think the druids are to thank for Christmas trees? Nope! That was Jesus, because it's symbolic of him hanging on the cross! Think gifts are commercialism? Nope! When on the ground, they look like the new Jerusalem skyline! Winter Solstice? Bah! God created the planets. He owns the solstice! And we celebrate then because god is light and the solstice is when it's darkest and coldest and we know he'll return.Underlying all of this is a marriage on the rocks because the husband just ""doesn't get"" Christmas and a single African American character that exists solely to into only provide lines like ""that's whack!"" and ""hold up!"" but also to give us an excuse to have a 5 min break dancing number at the end of the film (have you ever wanted to see Kirk Cameron break dance? Then this is a MUST watch).I will be watching this again at Christmas. Not to remind myself of the true meaning of the holiday, but to have an honest laugh. It's a wondrous holiday flop rivaled only by Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (also highly recommended)."

Last, the writing & acting of this head on train wreck is god awful!!

It's painfully obvious all the way through that they didn't even come close to have enough story or movie to fill out the run time, so the solution was giving the movie 3-4 different beginnings, inexplicable and gratuitous slow motion shots all the way through, characters repeating the same thing at each other ad nauseam, and a hip hop dance scene that goes on forever despite only one person taking part in that scene actually knowing how to dance.If your thing is watching bad movies don't even bother, it's incredibly dull. You can just look up the two scenes worth watching: the scene where the alien wearing Kirk Cameron like a skin suit is drinking from what is clearly an empty cup and the one where santa is beating up some dude to a dubstep soundtrack (in slow motion of course)."
" Saving Christmas is inept, imbecilic, and an absolute waste of anyone's time.
",-0.4215,-0.9813,2018-01-13 00:00:00,1,"When I reviewed The Last Airbender last year, I figured it would be the worst movie I would bother writing about on here. This one is something special. I have given very few films a 1/10 rating, as in order to do so, I must feel that it's devoid of all artistic and entertainment value. Because Saving Christmas fits the bill, I've given it that rarest of honors.When Kirk (Kirk Cameron) sees that his friend Christian (Darren Doane) isn't enjoying Christmas, he sits down with him to explain away his concerns about the holiday.I once saw a movie called Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny that was worse than Saving Christmas. I guess that's about the best I can say about it.The movie feels like a short film drawn out to an hour and twenty minutes. The main ""narrative"" involves 38 minutes of two men sitting in a car interrupted by slow motion flashbacks and fifteen minutes afterward dedicated to a dance sequence and credits/bloopers. That leaves the remaining half hour or so for slow motion footage, plodding narrations, and an obsession with hot chocolate. This is a movie that is terribly difficult to sit through.While it's clear that the film's technical integrity was at best a quickly abandoned afterthought in favor of its thematic material, the fact that it fails there as well is damning evidence of how poor this movie is. Saving Christmas isn't even about putting Christ back in Christmas, as the poster claims, but is instead about Cameron making up some spots to stick Him in. Much of the movie consists of Cameron explaining to his friend how different traditions had Christian meanings all along, such as Christmas trees representing Christ's cross, presents representing city skylines, and snow globes representing nativity scenes. The cast is likely a group of people that Cameron knows, and let's just say the few non-white people present really stand out. The only black character with a speaking role, Diondre (played by a man named David), is a jive-talkin', hip-hop-lovin' DJ who fits just about every stereotype you would expect of a man in this kind of movie.The worst part of this film, both onscreen and off, is Kirk Cameron himself. From this movie and the events surrounding its release, he strikes me as arrogant and self-aggrandizing. Every smug, nonsensical explanation that he offers to his friend is met with immediate awe and reverence. In reality, what he says throughout the film is at best naive and at worst falsehoods, distortions, and misrepresentations of both Christian and pagan histories. The fact that Cameron wrote these interactions framing himself as flawlessly as he did says something about the man's character.He goes as far as to praise Christmas-season materialism by declaring it to be a way to thank God for taking on a material body. That comparison is inherently trivial, as beyond the equivocation of the word ""material"", Cameron is describing every holiday and how it is celebrated. That is, of course, unless there is some ethereal holiday that cannot be celebrated by any physical means. What am I even talking about at this point?Saving Christmas is among the worst movies I've ever seen. It is an abject failure in all matters spiritual, historical, visual, audible, and ethical. At the core of this travesty is a pretentious, one-man charge toward desperate re-appropriation of Christmas traditions by a man who sees himself as our cultural savior. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the message is bad, the music is bad, the dancing is bad, the jokes is bad, and the hot chocolate is probably bad. Do not watch this movie."

Cameron spends the entire running time lecturing us on the true origins of Christmas, reassuring his audience that they have morality on their side. That's his bailiwick, but the whole movie's just a conversation in a car. That's it. The sermon's interminable.Look, I know this was never intended for me, but the overall cheapness is unforgivable.

If you can make these leaps, then you can watch this film and get something from it. You just have to let Kirk take you on a ride.It's only when we read too much into things - if that's Kirk's real sister, why isn't the brother-in-law played by the real brother? Where's Candace Cameron, his somewhat of a bigger star sister, and her husband, hockey player Valeri Bure? Why was there no hot chocolate in Kirk's mug in the overly earnest open? Does anyone who made this movie not realize that the DeAndre character is racist in its depiction of black people? Is anyone mad that they co-opted dubstep? Why wasn't POD in this movie?That said, I'm not going to make fun of Kirk for being a child star or his earnestly vacant stare. Obviously, this was not a movie made for me. I also don't think it was made for Christians. I think it was made for Kirk, his family and close multiethnic friends.

On top of that Kirk is portrayed as an absolute good guy who cannot do wrong. I remember it feeling preachy and generally like the movie is trying to make me believe in its ideas. I don't use the word propaganda very often but it felt a little like it. Just don't see this one, its not worth the time.

" A must avoid Christmas
",-0.296,-0.998,2017-09-29 00:00:00,1,"Watched 'Saving Christmas' out of curiosity to see if it really was as bad as the universal panning, its ranking on the Bottom 100 and its Razzie wins and nominations in most categories made out. The film is not available in my country, but the full film can be found online for anyone to see just in case anybody is wondering how it came to be watched by me.Finally seeing 'Saving Christmas', it turned out it not only really is that terrible but is one of my most regretted film viewings. One where a very early bailing was strongly considered but generously stuck with it in order to be fair, never judge films without seeing the whole thing (wish that more people did that instead of bragging about walking out after twenty minutes or something similarly ridiculous). It is by far the worst film of 2014, an easy contender for the worst of the decade and is bottom 5 material.And Kirk Cameron's immature and condescending defence of 'Saving Christmas' and attacking those who hated it (note to Mr Cameron, you don't have to be an atheist or even religious to find 'Saving Christmas' a terrible film, speaking as someone who is neither but with not a biased against Christians bone in my body) is a perfect example of what is wrong with how people express their opinions on film, critics and film watchers today. People who have an inability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, resort to the ""I'm right and you're wrong"" cliché and have to insult others, bash critics and invent ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories.Back to talking about 'Saving Christmas', the whole thing is hopelessly inept. It feels very slapped together with no rhyme or coherence, with amateurishly designed, written and acted biblical flashbacks, a lot of padding with scenes that go on forever (got tired of the scenes in the car fast, which saw lots of forced at best acting and gobbledegook that passes for dialogue), lots of repetition (like with the hot chocolate and the car conversations) and others having no reason for being there and Cameron's dubious generalisations (refuse to call them facts) and narration that come over as preachy, biased, self-absorbed sermonising standing out as especially bad. Oh and that ending dance sequence was an abomination in every sense, pacing, choreography, music, everything.It even looks bad, with some of the most artificial production values one will find anywhere let alone a film, complete with pedestrian photography and disjointed editing. The music was instantly forgettable as soon as the film was finally over and as for the direction, what direction? There is no coherence to the whole thing, the pacing is all over the place (interminably dull mostly) and there has never been more non-existent direction of actors, even on films riffed on MST3K.Writing is appalling from heavy-handed, egotistical start to abominable finish. That for Cameron has already been discussed but there is nothing heart-warming, funny or insightful about 'Saving Christmas', nothing that makes one think hard or feel anything. For a festive occasion, one couldn't imagine and will never see again a more drearily portrayed Christmas, this actually felt like it was made by people who hated Christmas even more than Ebeneezer Scrooge did. One is just bored out of their mind and angry at their life being wasted on a film that has no engagement, is so poorly put together and made, is impossible to learn anything from or get emotionally invested in and talks at them. Am not easily preached at, but 'Saving Christmas' talked at and down to me.Cameron's ""acting"" is extremely forced and patronising, pretty much like mugging, throughout and his huge ego bursts alive just as much on screen, in his material and how he delivered it, as it did when he attacked those who panned the film for far more legitimate reasons than he and the very small minority agreeing with him can ever give for finding any kind of value in the film. To me he is hypocritical as well as egotistical, due to that it is Christians that are more likely than anybody else to feel patronised to the most. The other cast members are not worth mentioning, don't even remember many, that's how much Cameron and his ego dominates.Overall, one of, and one of the biggest examples of, not many irredeemably awful films out there. Unless watching for curiosity's sake, this is a must avoid. 0/10 (an unheard of rating for me these days, have grown to hate giving them out, but 'Saving Christmas' is in the top 10 of the most deserving recipients of it).

" Cameron's Christmas Revisionism

Only the most die-hard fundamentalist trying to squeeze a Christian meaning out of every Christmas symbol would have liked this movie. The only Xmas show I've seen that's worse than this is the Star Wars Holiday Special (on YouTube), which has never been re-broadcast since 1978 or released on home video.Christian, Kirk's brother-in-law, is complaining about how so many of the symbols of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Kirk, in his revisionism, goes way out on a limb to deny the pagan origins of the symbols and traditions of Christmas. He tells Christian that Christmas trees were God's idea, since he made the trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross. Christian then starts complaining about Santa Claus. He sees Santa as replacing Jesus and notices that ""Santa"" and ""Satan"" have the same letters -- what a stretch. But Kirk tells him that the original Santa Claus was actually Saint Nicholas -- who in actuality was one of several sources for the character. Kirk ends his lecture be saying that the presents under the tree represent the buildings of New Jerusalem. The last 15-20 minutes are partying, eating, and bloopers.A conspiracy theorist, meanwhile, is complaining about the removal of public manger scenes, and says they're be removed to Area 52, which he says is similar to Area 51.Kirk's brother-in-law's real name, by the way, is John Ridenour. His name Christian in the movie is probably meant to represent Christians disappointed about the non-religious symbols of Christmas. Christian at one point says, ""It's like a car-jacking of our religion!"" This is probably a hint that Kirk, along with some Christians, doesn't like the loss of Christian dominance over the holiday season.Kirk's response to the failure of his movie was to blame it on a massive atheist conspiracy. Some people just don't like criticism. When they can't debate their opponents, they demonize them.If you want a good show about Christmas, I highly recommend History Channel's ""Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas."" It provides an excellent history of the symbols and traditions of the holiday, and shows the different views of it. ""Saving Christmas"" is at the opposite end of the spectrum."

It's God awful (pun intended if you can even find yourself to remotely laugh after watching it, because I can't) 2: It's a brainwashing mechanism that is designed to try to get people to think that commercialism is okay and that Christian (the second main character) being mad off about the original reasons in the first place is supposedly ""wrong"". 3: They're considering this a ""family fun Christian film"", yet Kirk bashed on another denomination and thinks that Jesus is white. Even though I'm not Pagan, they didn't have to be jerks about another person's beliefs. 4: The whole thing attempts to justify their ""reasons"" of saying how great commercialism is and that it's apparently part of the Christmas tradition.(Warning) This movie is a polished piece of crap.

At least those films had a few moments that were so-bad-they're good. This is an insult to intelligence! It currently stands at number 2 on this site's Bottom 100. I would place it top 10...there's just a few other films I've seen that I found worse.Let me start out by saying that I am a practising Catholic. I don't claim to be an expert on religion or the Bible as humility on the subject needs to be kept. Kirk Cameron could really use some of that too. Let me also say that there have been a few interviews where I agree with what Cameron debates. But this film made me lose all respect for him.Saving Christmas looks like a mockbuster. A ""mockbuster"" is a low-budget (sometimes micro- budget) rip-off of a huge film being released at the same time that is meant to capitalize on the bigger film's success. They look like they have a budget of $4. This movie literally looks like a micro-budget film. It stars Kirk Cameron playing himself who's hosting a Christmas party. The scenes that show the party are agonizing. The acting is unbelievably bad! His brother Christian is sick of the materialistic nature that Christmas has become and wants to put ""Christ"" back in ""Christmas."" He hides out in his car to do some thinking where idiotic Kirk comes to talk to him about his insecurities. This is the plot and it doesn't sound that bad eh? Only Kirk Cameron and company could take a subject worthy of discussion and spin it out of control.So what's so bad about the story? Sure the acting is horrid and the budget is low, but that's not the worst. The majority of the movie takes place in Christian's car with Cameron doing voice-overs in dramatizations of what he's taking about. Those dramatizations are very bad and unnecessary. It could have been a ""My Dinner With Andre"" style and kept the camera on them the whole time, but nooooooo. The technological issues are bad enough, and these little scenes just add fuel to the fire! And what Kirk talks about are all wrong and make no sense. The first thing that Christian complains about is the materialistic possession in Christmas and Kirk says all that stuff is great. Right away that's wrong. And he just goes on to randomly and falsely talk about Jesus' birth without even saying how that ties in with Christian's issue. Next is his shpeel about Christmas trees. Again, wrong explanation! And Kirk saying why Christmas is celebrated on December 25 is wrong too! Studies show that He was born around August. And that goes on and on with what feels like forever.Kirk Cameron's buddy in Christian director and pastor Alex Kendrick who I think is great. He could not save this mess. Any self-respecting Christian or anybody with half a brain can see that this is not a good film. It practically makes a mockery of the Messiah! Cameron caused a backlash with what he said was done by ""atheists."" It's not just atheists, it is also Christians that know better than you, Kirk!Instead of making a movie about Christ in Christmas, get somebody who knows their stuff to do a documentary on the subject.0/4"
