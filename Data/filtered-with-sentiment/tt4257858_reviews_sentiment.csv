" Important viewing for all, but only scratches the surface
",0.1027,0.8268,2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"I need to start this review with a big note of thanks. I am so grateful that Alex Gibney and his team made Going Clear. It is a film that shined a light on the frightening truth of the cult of Scientology for the masses, and hopefully has dissuaded some people from joining up. It's also great to see that they were able to find a number of famous people and other former high-ranking members of the cult to tell their stories. It helps avoid this becoming a documentary built entirely on hearsay, when you can see the truth spoken from those with first-hand experience. I only wish I saw this documentary when it was brand new. One of the things with a story as momentous and impactful as this one is that it gets talked about a lot in other forums, and I started to pick up many of the pieces of this story through cultural osmosis. It seems without actually watching Going Clear, I had already learned many of the worst facts it reveals. This made the experience feel a bit less impressive and impactful than I was hoping. I don't mean to criticize, because it is still effective and important work that was done with this documentary. I was just hoping that it would dig a bit deeper, but you can only do so much in 2 hours. Sadly, there might be a sequel someday with even more dark stories, because Scientology is not a thing of the past. I do recommend people check out Going Clear, particularly if you haven't heard much about this ""church"" and their insane beliefs and practises. It's a well-executed documentary that does a decent job of showing how good people can get trapped in a bad situation."
" Utter garbage
",0.0,-0.8506,2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your precious time watching this film. It's mostly weak, vulnerable idiots admitting on camera, that they're weak, vulnerable idiots."
" Going Clear
",0.3818,0.9776,2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"As might be suspected from its title, this documentary is not pro-Scientology. It is though fairly comprehensive, and includes archive footage of its founder. We hear recollections of L. Ron Hubbard's second wife who said he blackmailed her into marrying him, and that the only good thing that came out of her association with him was her daughter. She concluded that Hubbard came to believe the fantasies he created, something others have noted. Although we hear about his embellishments of his military career, there is no mention of bigamy or similar.Hubbard smiles a lot, so would you if you made as much money as he did bilking the gullible. There is footage of the cult's two most famous members: John Travola and Tom Cruise, as well as a number of former members who are less flattering about it.We are told all about the process of clearing; those who reach level three are introduced to the secret doctrine. One guy said he thought it was a test - if you believe this, they kick you out. Sadly, no.Although Hubbard died without leaving a designated successor, that was no impediment to the growth of his baby.Much space is given to the way the Church deals with its perceived enemies, including the aforementioned former members. While it definitely does not turn the other cheek but goes after its enemies passionately, did it really split up the marriage between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman?On the plus side, it has a healthy attitude to homosexuality, and there are genuine friendships between its members. Then there was its war against the IRS, now that was a master stroke! There is surely a lesson here for others in dealing with tyrants. The IRS had refused to acknowledge Scientology as a religion, which it clearly is, because it is only possible to be a Scientologist by accepting the revealed truth, especially at its higher levels.There is though no mention of the most positive aspect of its work, namely its collaboration with the late great Thomas Szasz to expose psychiatry for the fraud it is.While the Church has become obscenely rich - but nowhere near as rich as the Catholic Church - its membership has dwindled significantly in recent years. The Jehovah's Witness cult has suffered the same fate and for precisely the same reason. All hail the new God - the INTERNET!"
" even Elizabeth Moss, what a shame
",-0.4767,-0.2755,2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe someone like Elizabeth Moss can be part of this ""Church"". It is beyond any possible understanding."
" Yet another outstanding documentary from Alex Gibney
",0.6124,0.9343,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"""Going Clear: Scientology and The Prison of Belief"" (2015 release; 119 min.) is a documentary about the ""church"" of Scientology. As the movie opens, Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis in talking about his time at Scientology, leaving it after more than 30 years. Actor Jason Geghe comes next, leaving it after 13 years. PR consultant Spanky Taylor comes next, leaving it after 17 years. We then go to Scientology's international gala of November 29, 2013 in CLearwater, FL, where Tom Cruise gets a major honor. After those initial dizzying minutes, Gabney then retreats to giving a background profile on the colorful Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, who it turns out has written over a thousand books, many of them in the science fiction field... At this point we are 10 min.into the movie.Couple of comments: Alex Gibney is one of the most trusted and decorated documentary film makers of our time. I have seen many of his films, including ""Enron: The Smartest Guy in the Room"", ""Client 9"", ""Mea Maxima Culpa"", and ""The Armstrong Lie"", just to name those. For whatever reason, I had missed ""Going Clear"", even though I certainly was aware of it. Gibney goes about his usually hard-hitting ways, in the best possible sense. No topic is too hot to handle. What is most amazing about this, is when you got down to it, it is impossible to understand what Scientology is really about (please don't call it a religion, as that is truly insulting to the real religions out there). It is perhaps best described as a combination of control, greed, paranoia and intimidation, or, as Beghe describes it, ""a matrix of thoughts that is not your own"".""Going clear"" premiered at the 2015 Sundance film festival to immediate critical acclaim, and went wide on HBO a few months later, ultimately winning 3 Emmy Awards but strangely not even getting an Oscar nomination. The movie has of course heavily denounced by Scientology which only gave the film yet ever more publicity than it could've possibly have bought itself. If you are curious about what Scientology is all about or simply are a fan of Gibney's work, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."
" Good
",0.4404,-0.2263,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"Hubbard hated psychologists , psychiatrists and pharmacists . That's about 90000 NHS Heroes ."
" Great documentary
",0.6249,-0.3071,2020-05-07 00:00:00,8,"Very effective and quite damning. Alex Gibney did a great job with this comprehensive documentary based on Lawrence Wright's book. The high points:The in depth review of the life of L. Ron Hubbard's life, including documents that were unearthed, old video footage, and how the underpinnings for scientology trace back to his pulp science fiction novels. Most striking was Hubbard's own belief that he might be insane.Interviews of former members, some of them who were quite high up in the organization, detailing mental and physical abuse, how illegal activity is sanctioned by its codes, and what amounts to essentially slave labor in its ""Sea Org."" Most insightful were members describing how the cult atmosphere got them to do things themselves, and quite willingly.The description of the wacky beliefs about humanity's origins and all of the invisible aliens/thetans within us, and how these are only revealed after years and dollars have been invested in scientology. Also interesting was how its ""auditing"" sessions (essentially therapy sessions with L. Ron Hubbard's cooked up ""E-meter"") are recorded and logged to use as a source of power over its members who consider leaving.The review of how the organization gained religious (and hence tax exempt) status in America, and what this has in turn meant financially and legally. The profile of current leader David Miscavige, using video footage of his conferences and first-hand accounts of his behavior, is one of an aggressive and paranoid maniac. How his organization ruthlessly severs ties with non-believers and attacks and harasses its critics (physically, mentally, and legally) reveals this as well.Great pace, great research, and I'm glad this was made."
" The land of the gullible
",-0.3612,-0.7922,2019-07-28 00:00:00,10,"Some thoughts on this excellent documentary.
How is it possible that the IRS accepts that Scientology is a religion? There is no mention of a god, unless that god is L.Ron Hubbard, a clown who lied about his disastrous war service and realised that starting his own religion was the way to make a fortune. It seems the IRS caved in to the ""church's"" campaign of harassment, a familiar tactic which is also used on defectors.
The auditing, in which members spill their guts, should be treated the way a Catholic priest treats the secrets of the confessional. Instead what is divulged seems to be used to attack defectors and deter potential ones. Apparently Travolta wanted out. I don't know what they've got on him, but he's still in. putting a brave face on things.
Cruise, who was recruited by his first wife, is full committed (and should be committed.) He's got the two kids he and Nicole Kidman adopted to ""disconnect"" her. She and Katie Holmes did well to escape from such a narcissistic nutter.
The main reason this so-called church is so rich is that so many Americans are hopelessly gullible. The basic tenets of this self-improvement club are obviously dreamt up by a science fiction writer. Perhaps the problem is that Americans have no sense of irony or the ridiculous, and take themselves very seriously. This means they'll fall for snake oil salesmen and enrich TV evangelists, they'll drink Jim Jones' Kool Aid, and they'll even elect a frequently-bankrupt TV reality star as POTUS. Farcical."
" my notes
",0.0,-0.0129,2019-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Good documentary on a crazy topic. i already knew a lot of this, but i could not believe some of the other stuff they showed. it's honestly scary (1 viewing)"
" This will scare you with the truth
",-0.2263,-0.7618,2019-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Scientology sucks, just like all religions do, but it is far worse because the current leader of the cult is a mega psycho with delusions of grandeur. He is mimicking his father figure, LR Hubbard, who himself was paranoid, greedy, self righteous and a abusive person. All that, wrapped up in a phony sci fi story written by a guy who was a loser most of his life until he devised a story to sell to moronic people.This documentary covers all the bases and it is scary. Yes, this stuff really happened and yes these people are nuts.I thought that they had so much information that they had to cut a lot of it out because there seemed to be scenes where it was cut short, as if it was missing something.I thought that the use of real footage and live interviews from other sources was a good idea. I liked how they showed the followers in a real light and how movie stars help keep this cult alive.I don't like the US Government which allowed this cult to get tax free status. It should be revoked."
" Hippies One - Scientologists Zero!
",0.0,0.8951,2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Personal experience with this group has led to a lifelong fascination with cults, devour every film or book I come across on the subject. This documentary is one of the better ones out there, earned a couple of prime time Emmy's. It delves deep, it's entertaining (in a weird way) & it's definitely enlightening.There's a lot of stories out there, I'll add mine. They 'rescued' me when I was a 15 yr old runaway. Sure it got me off the streets, unfortunately I ended right back on them flogging there Dianetics books downtown Toronto.Which was actually pretty embarrassing, luckily I didn't run into anybody I knew:)Next they enrolled me in expensive mandatory courses, in no time I was deep in their debt. The good news - this was a relatively short bump in my life journey. I called up some hippy friends (they weren't all peace and love you know) who came to my rescue & got me the h...ll out of there. All very exciting, hippies throwing computers around & threatening to call the police - but I digress. I'm one of the lucky ones who came through relatively unscathed, a lot of people didn't, I feel for them.Guess it goes without saying I recommend you watch this expose!"
" Profound work
",0.0,0.9816,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"This film is giving a great insight into mechanisms that lay beneath Scientology Church. It uncovers standard methods of psychological pressure that were applied to members to keep them involved. You hear it first hand from former top level scientologists. I really like investigation on big stars involvement - like Cruise and Travolta - it definitely demonstrates all tricks that scientologists use to promote themselves.
Definitely gives some interspection in relations within belief-based society, which appear to be so similar in so different cultures.
Definitely worth seeing, just because it's a part of human history and our mutual cultural heritage. Hubbard pulled off a great magic trick."
" A real-life horror movie
",-0.5719,0.761,2018-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Based on the non-fiction novel by American author Lawrence Wright, this documentary exposes the history of the ""Church"" of Scientology (CoS). Its main sources are interviews with eight former members of the organization.While it has already been widely understood that the CoS has cult-like characteristics, this movie provides details which are shocking. Whether it is devious litigation to maintain tax-free status or the great harm imposed on members (and non-members) for not towing the line, this documentary has the occasional effect of a horror movie. It's all the more horrifying knowing the real-life consequences, not only for the interviewees but also for the many unknown others who are currently being harmed and others yet to be in the same situation.The interviewees are candid about what lured them into the organization and how good it was for them in the beginning. These people are the most inspiring part of the movie. Not only are they frank about their regrets but they show great courage in doing what they are doing especially as they continue to be ""punished"" for all they have exposed."
" Interesting start, gets boring as time goes by
",0.1027,0.8224,2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"This is like a primer for people that know nothing about Scientology, its origins, practices or high profile cases. The more you know about it, the less interesting it gets because there's very little original discovery in the documentary.The beginning was very, very interesting. The first 48 minutes had me glued to the screen. It is a biography of LRH. The rest of it, if you're old enough or read enough, is all from the news."
" Absolutely brilliant!
",0.6581,0.8707,2018-03-26 00:00:00,10,"There's not much more to say honestly. Winner of 3 primetime Emmy awards, '' Going Clear '' destroys all of Scientology's lies in one riveting swoop. The whole documentary is really well made and painfully interesting. Good on them for speaking out against this sordid cult."
" Excellent Expose on a Cult For The Emotionally-Needy And Psychologically-Damaged...
",0.4767,0.9033,2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"----It always shocks me (almost physically) when listening to individuals explain the allures a certain cult had for them...""Going Clear"" contains dozens of such interviews of individuals who had been ardent supporters of Scientology---many of them, quite successful in their particular fields of endeavour....---The truly ""shocking"" aspect for me is in realising the almost limitless number of the truly gullible and credulous who are living among us....WHAT makes a person so weak? WHAT causes an otherwise intelligent individual to suspend all rational disbelief---and buy into whatever claptrap a smooth-talking confidence man (such as L. Ron Hubbard) is selling?----I confess to being totally at a loss as to why anyone would be attracted to such a cult--- not being (at all) a ""follower-type,"" and a born sceptic, to boot....It is fascinating, however, to hear the various stories of those who succumbed to Hubbard's siren song (the type of ""fascination"" one experiences when viewing an accident in slow-motion, in order to discover where the driver went terribly wrong)....."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9178,2017-09-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a great documentary, especially if you are also currently watching Leah Remini's series on A&E. It goes a little bit more in depth about certain aspects, namely the celebrities. I wish there had been more from Mike Rinder but luckily we see him with Leah Remini. He's interesting and well-spoken, and has seen quite a bit more of the inside than others."
" A big eye-opener
",0.0,0.9442,2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"I'd give it a 9 out of 10, because it's a truly amazing documentary covering all aspects of Scientology in a simplistic way for everyone to understand. The effort HBO put into releasing this documentary is amazing and I recommend this documentary all the time to friends, especially to people who don't know what Scientology is."
" Awful and biased
",-0.6249,-0.8742,2017-07-20 00:00:00,1,"This is not a documentary, it deliberately shows one side only. All the interviewees are people that have been many many years ago members and all of them have a negative attitude towards Scientology. Isn't it peculiar that ALL of the interviewees are of that sort?It is called hate, discrimination, but even that hate isn't genuine -it's all for the buck only."
" One of the most fascinating, disturbing documentaries I've ever seen
",0.0553,0.6998,2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"I haven't seen a documentary that crosses so many levels as this one - brainwashing, capitalism, religion, IRS wranglings, celebrity, psychopathy, abuse, deception and conspiracy - its all here in abundance. You can barely process the magnitude and implications of a moment when its taking into another equally as disturbing but about another angle entirely. I'm so glad that HBO and all involved had the balls and legal representation to produce this - and that Miscavige et al couldn't do a thing about it. The disturbing underlying implication is just how exploitable the human mind is. Once someone enters into a narrow tunnel of awareness, the installed belief systems can be engineered precisely to protect themselves - shutting out all interference and counter- evidence. That people like John Travolta ignore entirely the negative/thought-supressive aspects of Scientology in favor of their petty positives shows just how obtuse they are. The intrinsic need for power and status (Hubbard, Cruise, Miscavige) that some people have borders on psychotic in how it manifests."
" This is how you do it
",0.0,0.4777,2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Yes my summary is meant to mean more than one thing. Not sure if the Church of Scientology (self proclaimed I may add) can say the same thing about their beliefs and programs. But the documentary does point out many things that are wrong with them. And if you do a documentary, this one is a good example how to do it right.Of course a lot of things came together, former high ranked Scientology officials, who are not with the ""Church"" anymore. There are also people from Hollywood (Paul Haggis is the biggest name to come out of the whole thing and he's talking about his experience) in this. So while Travolta and Cruise did not comment or rather refused to be interviewed, you do see official clips, that do get commentary or stand for themselves especially in light what other things are being shown and discussed. Very informative and really well researched and amazingly put together structure-wise.Highly recommended and very interesting, even if you didn't care that much about them before watching this"
" It does tell a lot of Scientology and its followers!
",0.0,0.8135,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"This appeared on the Sky Arts channel which is kinda odd for this documentary to air but anyhow, it was very informative even though it was long. It really got into the detail of this Hubbard guy who was a Sci-Fi writer and pretty much he set up the Scientology religion in order to avoid to pay his taxes. He was really clever but yet a crook who just managed to find a way to brainwash people including the tax people and worship him as the big guy of the pack.This is my first time seeing Tom Cruise and John Travolta in the Scientology events that take place in some big Los Angeles gala. Actually, its the first time I've ever seen them both talk among the other followers about their religion. Now this made me wonder, where were the other celebrity Scientology followers such as Kirstie Alley, Kelly Preston, Nancy Cartwright and among many others? Why did Tom Cruise and John Travolta have to deny to give an interview for this documentary? What are they hiding here with regards to Scientology?Really good documentary about how Scientology works and its members, 8/10 it deserves!"
