" Waste of your time
",-0.4215,0.7096,2021-02-26 00:00:00,3,"The first half of this movie sets up nicely as, although it looks like it will be predictable, you aren't quite sure.Then snap off it goes. Now normally I would consider that a good thing.Not in this case, it jumps from reasonable and considered to absurd, then it jumps again, and again, each time getting more ridiculous.At the end you are left wondering where the interesting movie went and who allowed for this contrived disaster to occur?Towards the end it gets twisty, oooh twisty, it comes across as completely 'lets do this they won't see it coming' moment, rather than a genuine notion."
" Crap
",-0.3818,-0.9551,2021-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I'm not sure why it has a high ratings here. This movie drags on and boring. Plain stupid and drags On forever. You can't save a psychopath, they are screwed up in the head that she couldn't let go of her cheating boyfriend."
" The film goes nowhere
",0.0,-0.7707,2020-12-31 00:00:00,4,"First half was well done. Ok acting, intentionally awkward scenes.Then the twist occurs and the movie doesn't know where to go. Seth's personality flip-flaps a couple times.The ending killed me. The whole time, the cage was locked with a combination lock. Just try the 10000 combinations, you dumb blonde !!"
" Just kind of not particularly interesting
",-0.3559,0.8286,2020-12-10 00:00:00,4,"When your movie rests upon the viewer accepting a series of ridiculous unexplained improbabilities, then your movie needs to at least be good. It needs to at least be interesting. If it's not those things, and you just threw a whole bunch of ridiculous silly scenes at me, then it gets a low score.Don't waste your time. I can't think of a single scenario where I'd ever recommend this to anyone, or watch it again.4.5 for decent production values and acting from the 2 main characters."
" In a few words...

" Another very Underrated movie, great thriller with a twist!!
",0.7467,0.9274,2020-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Some horror but mostly a thriller it has a great twist and 1 you dont see coming also small budget and cast but neither was needed. Some might call it a slow burn but it pays off, if you're expecting Friday the 13th or a ghost story this isn't it but if you want a decent thriller with a twist watch this. I'll definitely watch it again, also excellent performances by the 2 lead actors."
" Really quite good.
",0.5379,0.9115,2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,"I'll start off with the negatives, i thought more could have been done with the girl in the cage, although i do see where they were going with it, i just feel it could have been a little more.The positives, this isn't your usual girl stuck in cage movie. Of course there are a couple similarities, as there always is, but the over all premise of the movie was good. Won't give too much away though.My favourite part is the ending. The fact we see her come back, the guy in the cage, it's obviously been some time as the guy we left was missing one finger. Now, hes got two fingers missing, blind in both eyes, a face that has either been scolded, or covered in acid, amongst other things. We find out that she has essentially been torturing/mutating him, to make sure she doesn't kill in her usual life, and he lets her, because he loves her.Couple of plot holes, but nothing that really bothers me."
" maybe i am too easy
",0.4404,0.8625,2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"But I was surprised and then surprised again by this movie. Perhaps the other reviewers are smarter than me and saw the plot twists coming, but those twists worked on me. The movie started off dark and intense, then inexplicably became more dark and intense, and then it punched me in the gut."

" pretty average
",0.4939,0.8832,2020-06-04 00:00:00,4,"Yes a couple of little twists and turns. Maybe i have seen too many of this style. Orignally i thought he was going to kidnap and feed her up, she certainly looked in need of a large dinner lol What is it with movie makers and very very slim actors. She could have gotten through those bars easily. Hardly average was she? More like average if he had starved her lol"
" Dark horror/thriller, decent
",0.0,0.9671,2020-05-23 00:00:00,6,"Holly (Ksenia Solo) is young, beautiful and single. She smokes a lot and aspires to become a writer. She also has an obsessed stalker (Dominic Monaghan), who kidnaps and imprisons her in a dog cage. But Holly has a very dark secret, giving the film a major plot twist.
I found Pet to be fairly tense, well acted (Monaghan does a great American accent, something that many Brits can't do - and vice versa), and there is some seriously strong violence and gore. The cast is pretty small, which helps keep it tight. In particular I liked Da Vone McDonald as the security guard, who provides a little light relief in what is a very dark movie. The plot twist does stretch believability, which is the only real negative for me, but overall Pet is a decent watch."
" Surprised Me
",0.2263,-0.5662,2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Going into this I expected it to be a run of the mill torture porn genre film. It actually surprised me though. It's isn't anything more then a simple ""Good"" but it also isn't as mediocre as a lot of reviews are saying. Or at least it wasn't for me. The movie follows Seth, a man who works at an animal shelter and is all around depressed and feels without purpose. When he suddenly runs into an old high school crush he pursues her and when she rejects his advances he kidnaps her and takes her as his. While there is a small amount of stereotypical torture type stuff in the film it is by all accounts mostly an original psychological thriller, with its fair share of blood and guts thrown in. I found it quite enjoyable, specifically when we learn about Holly mid-way through the film. I will say though rewatching this film will probably not do a whole lot for you, but if you're looking for a psychological horror black comedy type film with some interesting sound design this is going to be right up your alley."
" Dark Twisting Thriller
",0.1027,-0.8601,2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Pet (2016): Seth (Dominic Monaghan) works in an animal shelter where he discovers a forgotten basement. His attempts to get Holly (Ksenia Solo) to date him are rebuffed. He stalks her online, at the Caf√© where she works, follows her. When her ex punches him he gets more determined. He abducts Holly and imprisons her in a cage in the basement. Holly is no ordinary victim though, she has unexpected depths. Quite a few surprises and plot twists in this dark thriller. Although there are some gory and shocking scenes the emphasis is on psychological horror, paranoia and manipulation. Directed by Carles Torrens from a script by Jeremy Slater. 7/10."
" not a copy paste horror movie
",0.4585,-0.7968,2020-05-05 00:00:00,9,"I watch so many horror movies, when I went to turn this on, I pegged it as your typical boy stalks and keeps girl captive story. That is NOT what this story is. I am RARELY surprised by movies, especially horror and this one had at least 2 or 3 surprises for me.I really recommend it to true horror fans."
" Gripping psychological thriller that did make me squirm at times
",0.1027,0.9528,2020-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Seth (Dominic Monaghan) is a lonely man who works in a dog shelter. He's a pretty quiet guy who ultimately is searching for a connection to another human being. He randomly bumps into Holly (Ksenia Solo) a girl who he knew at school from afar. After a few unsuccessful attempts to get to know her, he decides to build a metal cage, kidnap her and keep her hostage in that cage underground at his place of work. That's just the beginning; what follows are twists and turns galore! The tag line for the film is simply 'A Love Story' and that perfectly summarises the tone and twisted stance that it is going for; the most uncomfortable feeling you're left with after the film is that, it actually is a love story at the core of it told through a disturbing perspective. Monaghan and Solo are absolutely fantastic in the lead roles; particularly Solo who is really impressive here and it will be pretty awesome to see what work she goes on to do. She portrays the fear, desperation and insanity, as someone trapped in a cage for days would, really brilliantly. The script does feel a little too forced in the build up, most notably from Holly's start to the story but it does make sense in the long run. The music by Zacarias M. De La Riva is pretty good and there's one sequence in particular with repetitive dog barks interspersed with the beats that really added to the disturbing quality. It's certainly worth checking out for anyone that likes the sound of it! And that ending...."
" Nice Twist
",0.4215,0.2263,2020-02-13 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly a solid horror movie that had some nice twist that you don't see coming.
" I admire it for its uniqueness.
",0.4767,0.8812,2019-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Original and individual tale that despite the rather basic sounding plot summaries you might find for it, actually has a very rich and well paced plot to chew on.Not quite horror or a thriller in the more familiar sense. A sort of third pole within the umbrella of dark fiction where a cat and mouse style set is used to explore the lengths we go to escape personal demons.Marred only by its naive approach to music and a heavy handed approach to making its protagonist feel like a high school loser, there is otherwise nothing in particular I'd condemn asides from a general tone that stops it being masterpiece.I'm willing to believe the problem is on my end. I want to like this movie. It comes from a good place creatively. They had a very particular story to tell in a particular way and told it without caring too much how many people liked them, only whether the right kind of person would respond well to it. If you're one of the these people that just NEEDS someone to root for in a movie you may find this one isn't for you, but if you want something that is neither desperate to conform to a particular genre/idiom nor to be viciously avant-garde, then this is one that deserves a chance."
" Great psych thriller
",0.6705,-0.4003,2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Psychological thriller, madness, reverse psychology, depravity, great acting, well finessed storyline, horror and crazy; this describes the film Pet!"
" Very good but not great
",-0.5179,-0.3525,2019-09-04 00:00:00,7,"I tend to shy away from movies that look like they spend the majority of the time in one location, but this film did a comendable job of remaining relatively gripping throughout, desipite the simple setting. The interplay between the two leads more than made up for the lack of diversity from scene to scene.I'm sick and tired of B-level horror movies with poor writing and even worse acting; this certainly was not that. This film was creative, gritty, tense at times and overall well done.It is not, however, generous with its action scenes or stingy with its dialogue. It nonetheless built wonderfully but ultimately ends in somewhat of a let down. A few good twists at the end save the story but it still felt like it was missing something, or that it could have done more, given the fantastic build up.I really wish that IMBD did half point ratings because I would have given this one a 6.5 - it's clearly above average but just not great."
" Perfect
",0.5719,0.8718,2019-08-10 00:00:00,8,Just perfect! Actors are amazing As well as the scenario
" Tension throughout, a modern horror masterpiece
",-0.2263,-0.3564,2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why the reviews here only come up to a 5.3 average. Honestly, for a psychological horror, this is way better than that. Beautiful colour and cinematography, a modern edit, a well-balanced and artistic soundtrack, earnest cast putting in good performances, a great story you won't see coming (if you haven't read any spoilers), and a sound script. There's a sense of of dread all the way through the first half. Perhaps that's where the bad reviews are coming in. Some things change, and many feel betrayed or left behind. I think that's really harsh. Movies are supposed to surprise, or allow for other possibilities than what we're used to. I am not an historian, but I wouldn't wonder that one of the reasons the Dark Ages were called the Dark Ages is because culture barely changed a jot in hundreds of years. That's simply not art as we know it today. Movies aren't bound to a formula, nor are they bound to not follow a formula. Just a thought. In any case, I have no problem recommending this movie. For a low budget indie one should just admire it for its professionalism. For me, Pet nailed every second, and was riveting throughout."

" I liked it
",0.4215,0.9094,2019-05-12 00:00:00,8,This movie was a head trip and shows how fragile peoples feelings really are. You cant just blow off a crush sometimes. You have to be nice about it and handle it best you can. The ending is super trippy!!!!
" Not satisfying
",-0.357,-0.5423,2019-04-30 00:00:00,2,"A boring, hard to get through movie about the stereo typical weak male who wants to dominate a woman and make her love him. Other than one suspenseful moment, it was all very boring. Just another horrible movie where I find myself amazed I was able to get to the end without switching it off halfway through."
" INTENSE
",0.0772,-0.2563,2019-03-19 00:00:00,6,"The movie is so fast and thrilling till end.There is a great twist,jaw dropping moments.But there is something that feels missing and it's just a watch with some wrong ideologies.If you are just to spent 90 min,this may be it but don't hope for a story."
" Just okay
",0.2263,-0.7859,2019-01-09 00:00:00,4,"Great premise but ended up being very disappointing. I went into this movie excited to be scared. My roommate and his girlfriend had gone to see it and told me it was genuinely scary; the critics were raving about its originality, and I was ready for a tense, edgy, chilling experience. It never really lived up to my very high hopes."
" Pleasantly surprised
",0.6124,-0.6859,2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,I got a recommendation to watch so I went in not knowing anything. Glad I did.Great writing despite what the ridiculously low-scoring amateur critics say (mostly for attention I suspect).Give it a watch if you can stomach something a little disturbing at times.
" Totally not what I was expecting.
",0.0,0.8973,2018-12-24 00:00:00,8,Very dark and very twisted. Full of plot twists that are jaw dropping. Good suspense and classic gore. Although not over done. Very pleasantly surprised. Would recommend. Worth the watch.
" Stick with it, good but not great
",-0.5409,0.9382,2018-11-11 00:00:00,6,"I read a lot of criticism about the Seth character, no I never saw him before, and didn't see the Hobbit. I thought his performance as a poor, love starved, nobody was pretty decent. Nothing new in the concept, kidnap someone, and put them im a cage. Not a particulary gory film but there were a couple of scenes where I looked away. The character Holly ended up being just as much the psychopathic manipulator as her captor. Nice film, small cast, some lines seemed to be delivered in a lacklustre way, but over all I enjoyed it. Better than I was expecting. Nice twist at the end, too."
" Unexpected Twist
",0.0,0.6597,2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,Yes as some has told you this one can be a little slow. But I was actually surprised by the end. Did not see that one coming. I almost shut it off but decided to see it through. I'm glad I did. Don't let the slow start stop you. Just go for it.
" Completely routine
",0.0,0.3919,2018-10-31 00:00:00,4,"PET is another boring kidnap thriller that revolves around a psycho keeping a woman captive and caged in his basement. I know such films are very cheap to film, but it takes a lot of creativity and technical prowess to make them actually interesting, and sadly that isn't the case here. Former hobbit Dominic Monaghan plays an ordinary blue collar worker who becomes obsessed with a woman he knew in his younger days, and his obsession knows no boundaries. There's a certain slickness to the direction as well as character depth you don't normally find in the genre. However, it's also entirely routine and unexciting, with cliche after cliche building to an entirely expected outcome."
" Pet needed to restrain its implausibilities with both a leash and a cage.
",0.0,-0.9588,2018-10-14 00:00:00,4,"Subversive thrillers that purposefully twist genre tropes are always welcome. Those that attempt to push boundaries, testing the limitations of the viewer's mind. Pet does just that, which is why I should've liked this. Unfortunately though, its mediocre execution and completely absurd plot twists hinder what was a decently captivating premise. A lonely man encounters an old school friend, quickly becoming fixated on her. His stalker-like behaviour rapidly ascends to the sociopathic as he kidnaps her and locks her in a cage. This first act of what should've been a promising claustrophobic thriller was well constructed. Monaghan's awkward performance substantiates enough creepiness to acquire your attention. Tension was slowly rising, if somewhat predictably at first. The mood was tepidly eerie and the stalking felt unsettling. Then we arrive at the second act. A simple but effective premise becomes lost in favour for unpredictability. The twisted ""the abuser becomes the abused"" theme has been explored before, with varying results. The major problem with this film is with the lack of character development and two ridiculously mentally unstable individuals. So messed up that any actions felt derivative. Relying on implausibility to make unpredictable twists does not make an engrossing thriller. It loses all tension and focus, making it a bland experience. From expositional hallucinations to chopping off a finger in the name of love. Nothing feels captivating. Which is a shame as the two lead performances were committed and intriguing to watch. The concluding ten minutes gets back on track slightly, although the final minute was stupidly unrealistic. However it's probably more exciting to just go out and walk your dog. That feels more real atleast..."
" A-game not brought
",0.0,0.7537,2018-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Love the cast, but they clearly weren't into it, come on director! Dominic Monagan needs to decide on an accent, the character doesn't need to be american, so why try at all?"
" Not what you think. Great film
",0.6249,0.7469,2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"NOTE: I don't want to write any spoilers because I think they would ruin the film. It's worth the mystery...trust me.  Let me just start by saying that I am an avid horror film watcher (sifting through anything and everything to find the gold nuggets from B-rated to full fledged productions). So I'm writing this review from the stance of someone who has seen A TON of terrible and cringe-worthy horror/thrillers.Honestly, I've scrolled past this movie dozens of times because frankly I am not into the sadistic, torture-porn of women that can be found in a lot of horror films out there; it disgusts me to see that in films. **THIS MOVIE IS NOT THAT.**That's all I will say so as not to ruin it. My only reason for finally watching it was a few reviewers who expressed just what I am now. I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. The cast was well performed and, though slower paced than most, the story felt cohesive and well planned. It's obviously a movie for the fans of the psychological and thriller genre so be warned that there is one scene of graphic gore. Really where this film exceeded my expectations though, was its portrayal of its characters. There are countless horror/thriller stories that cover a variety of subject matter that's outside of the normal human condition. The subjects range from the controversial to the down right sadistic. The films that I personally find successful, are the ones that allow you to empathize with an otherwise unsavory character flaw/trait. It's no easy task for the writers, directors and actors, but when they accomplish it I always find it an enjoyable experience. This film does that for me. It takes a little piece of black and white out of the world, and opens my eyes just a bit wider to the huge gray area out there."
" Why?
",0.0,-0.6551,2018-08-12 00:00:00,3,So we started watching this and right from the start taking a dog down just ruined the whole movie for us. That was so stupid for the writers to do that. We are dog lovers and have 3 and all I could do was think about through the whole movie. That was so NOT necessary! Booooo
" Clever with good acting and plot twists
",0.7096,0.7615,2018-07-25 00:00:00,8,"I was impressed with the plot, which I thought was clever and believable. I also thought the acting was good. I'm no expert critic, but I cared about the characters, which means the actors did their jobs."
" Somewhat flawed if watchable psychological thriller
",0.1027,0.7083,2018-07-16 00:00:00,5,"After meeting a striking beauty, a lonely man trying to win her over begins stalking her to the point that he has to kidnap her and put her in a cage underneath his job only to find that she's far from normal and begins playing a series of mind games with him that put him in greater danger.This was quite a decent if highly flawed effort. One of the few areas where this one succeeds commendably is on the form of psychologically playing with the captor which runs for the majority of the film. Being able to transform from a simpering doe-eyed victim to a full-on take charge protagonist that's able to effectively manipulate his thought-process which is quite enjoyable to see play out as she's a full-on rampaging maniac throughout here. It's a change that works quite well for the film and gives this a different take than what's to come from these kinds of films where these revelations give a darker edge to the main section of the film as it has a lot to like with the various encounters found here. Coupled nicely with the brutality and gruesomeness of the gore featured here, it has a few solid elements to be featured that are enough to be watchable over the main flaws. Among the main flaws present here is the fact that this type of storyline makes it impossible to be invested in what happens. With the first half of this one so concerned with the manner of him stalking her, from the diner where she works to the confrontation at the bar with her ex-boyfriend that results in him being beaten up for a misunderstanding, none of this activity is really all that rooted in the tropes of the genre resulting in a series of bland, incredibly boring sequences that don't do anything for this type of story. It takes way too long to get to the actual horror setup here because it's going on the concept of him trying to get in contact with her through those means that aren't in the slightest bit revolving around any kind of scary action. As well, that also highlights the more important factor here in that nearly everything in this one is completely underserved. The whole idea of him capturing and kidnapping her and then holding her hostage underneath the facility is not for the slightest bit earned in any fashion, resulting only from one meeting in a bar that could've easily gone another direction had she been reasonable enough to listen to him. Instead, shortly after that one lone interaction he feels vindicated enough to drug her, drag her into a home-made steel cage and keep her held against her will inside which comes out of nowhere. Likewise, the revelations made about her through keeping her hostage are just thrown into this one at such a bizarre turn that it really feels out of place like it's a shocking turn that's unwarranted through the build-up. Even with those positives, these are enough to hold it down significantly.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
" A very enjoyable movie
",0.4927,0.9545,2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"I was unsure what to expect before watching this as there was a numbe for negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline has been done before but this film introduces a key modern day element, Social Media. I found the development of the characters good and the pace of the film kept me interested. I would certainly recommend watching this film."
" A socially awkward man kidnaps his lady crush
",-0.296,0.9836,2018-06-20 00:00:00,8,"This is a thriller that is not what you would expect. It leans more on drama but also gives you tension as well. Dominic Monaghan plays the awkward man well, while his captive, played by Ksenia Solo also provides a great performance. From the beginning, Dominic Monaghan manages to make us root for his character, and even his kidnapping of Solo's character makes it look like he was being foolish, but not evil. Solo's performance is brilliant too because she manages to keep you guessing how she can outwit Monaghan's character and escape. The dialogues sound more like a philosophical back and forth but the acting body language is very obvious and requires careful observation from the audience. In the end, it is a good movie because you care for the protagonist, and it keeps you quietly wondering. The shortcoming was that the tension was too low key. The ending is interesting and if you fail to watch till the end, you will never appreciate the story."
" Reviewing With Josh!! ""Pet""
",0.0,0.7841,2018-05-26 00:00:00,4,"Pet is a thriller about a man who abducts a woman and keeps her in a basement under the place where he works (a pet shop). This film has numerous twists and a very surprising end, however it is not enough to make this film a masterpiece."
" So dumb

" Great twist, poor ending.
",0.25,0.3191,2018-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Pet starts off as a regular B-movie psychological thriller about a kidnapping, and with a great twist in the middle, turns into something special. But something goes wrong shortly after the twist, the film doesn't deliver what it teases the audience for more than an hour. As if that twist has no consequences, and there is no definite climax. The idea is a breath of fresh air for the sub-genre, but it is poorly executed. Despite its dullness here and there, ""Pet"" is still worthwhile for the sake of the aforementioned twist and a must-watch for the fans of Dominic Monaghan."
" Keep This Mutt in the Kennel
",0.0,-0.4854,2018-03-23 00:00:00,3,"The movie starts off suggesting it may be headed for interesting but familiar territory. In fact it seems to be on track to be a low-rent version of William Wyler's classic ""The Collector"". But no such luck. It quickly derails and eventually crashes in a heap of pointless and gruesome nonsense. Along the way it attempts to explore lofty ideas about will controlling destiny, or something like that, but falls far short.

While the film occasionally lacks in the credibility department (would all dog pounds have such extensive catacombs?), it makes up for any plausibility shortfalls by crafting two well developed main characters with any intriguing power dynamic between them. Dominic Monaghan is perfectly cast as the socially awkward lead with ample scenes that humanise him (hugging a dog while it receives a lethal injection) to the point that he only ever seems misguided and not monstrous in his actions. As his victim, Ksenia Solo seems to have a very bland character at first, but from the moment she wakes up in the cage, our perceptions about her change by the minute. Clocking in at only around 90 minutes, the filmmakers could certainly have done more with characters' psychological tug-of-war. Either way though, this is not the typical captivity thriller that one might expect based on the title and promotional artwork. The film finishes on a memorable note too with it left up to us to consider whether the protagonist unexpectedly achieved his deepest desires or not. To state much more might ruin a fresh experience; suffice it to say, this is a film best entered with as few preconceptions as possible."

",0.0,0.6925,2017-09-27 00:00:00,9,"It's been a while since I wrote a review, but this movie was so interesting that I took the time to write down my opinion. It is about a young man and the woman he wants. When she shows no interest he starts to stalk her and build a cage to imprison her.Even though you get the feeling that he's the bad guy and she's the victim, the movie shows his motives and emotions so well that you can understand them. According to the young woman's analysis he suffers from insecurities, self-hatred, depression and loneliness. Undoubtedly this combination can lead one to dark and dangerous paths. Yet the movie manages to surprise you by revealing that things sometimes aren't as they appeared to be. Quite the opposite actually. And as things unfold and secrets come to light you'll find yourself wondering who to root for.The story is interesting enough and the acting is significantly better than I would have expected given the topic and the summary I had read before watching. Lately there seem to be many movies around that thematize crimes and delinquents (often mentally ill ones) from a very unique and special point of view. This is one of them. Much like ""The woodsman"" (2004) it may not be suitable for everyone, but I found it interesting and worthwhile."

A movie to leave you disgusted and depressed. A physiological horror for sure, not the slasher kind, but far more disturbing. Another movie to show that with the desired looks, you can get away with anything. Is the main character able to get the outcome hes after? Well kinda.

What is slightly different is that he doesn't torture her, he wants to ""save her"" from herself. The cage is located underneath an animal shelter where Seth works, but is close to being terminated. The second twist is that the captive appears to be crazier than her captor, and then there is the question of who is really in control.The film was good for what it was in a crowded genre of ""B"" films. Claire (Jennette McCurdy) added a depth to this genre you don't normally see, making the film more of a psychological thriller than a horror.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity."

As the watcher you slowly put pieces¬†together and try to solve the mystery right in front of you, but there was more than just what met the eye. At first glance a movie like this is minuscule¬†on the ""to watch list,"" but I promise you that PET is a movie to keep in mind when picking your next movie to watch. What really keeps you on the edge of your seat though is the actors. This movie gives a whole new meaning to the word crazy, and they needed talented actors to pull it off. Lucky enough, the director found two impressive¬†actors to carry out complex roles. You could genuinely believe that these actors lived their lives like this in their real life, it came second nature to them. To sidetrack for a little bit, the ending was also very unsettling. It completely takes your breathe away. You sit there watching this masterpiece come to an end only to get drawn back in again.CONS:¬†Slow burner. This movie took a really long time to pick up the pace. I appreciated¬†how the characters were developed in the mean time, but the movie felt rather ""too"" slow for my liking.

" Mediocre Thriller
",0.1027,-0.9592,2017-08-07 00:00:00,5,"""Pet"" is nowhere close to the worst made horror film I have seen, as a fan of horror (even the bad ones sometimes) I have watched my fair share of god-awfulness, but it is not a very good one either.The 1st half of the movie is generally well-done and unsettling, but not very original: Lonely creep stalks pretty girl. There scenes that are well-crafted, one in a diner is almost unwatchable it is so awkward (intentionally so), and give us a good feel for Seth's loneliness, frustration, and (a tad too quick) devolution into complete obsession. His target, Holly, is less developed at this time. She largely just gets increasingly unnerved by Seth.Then comes the 2nd half, and the film goes off the rails a bit, even as it tries to add more originality to it. After Seth has locked Holly in the cage, the movie's big twist, about Holly, is revealed. Sure the twist is pretty ridiculous, but being a horror movie, it's nothing too unreasonable. The twist just didn't have the intended impact with me however, largely because the movie up to this point has gotten us to know Seth, not Holly. So the big twist about her is rendered kind of ""meh"". The psychological battle that follows Holly's imprisonment is fairly predictable, as is its final result. The wildly inconsistent characterization of Seth also hinders the film's 2nd half, especially its 3rd act. During the 1st half Seth goes from lonely loser to a cackling madman, then in the 2nd from that to controlling kidnapper to groveling wimp who maims himself, with not a lot of segue in between. Almost seems more like Seth turned into whatever was convenient to move the story along, rather than a character of his own. The acting by the leads was pretty good. Despite having to put up the poor writing of his character, Dominic Monaghan is convincing as Seth, especially during the 1st half. I am a big fan of Ksenia Solo and think she is one of the best young actresses working today, and she doesn't disappoint as Holly, even if it isn't an extraordinary performance (just a tad over-the-top in a couple scenes). Their lines could have had some work though, more than a few of them are remixed clich√©s (""So, you think you know me?"" and the like).More than a couple scenes in the movie also require some suspension of belief, the ending pretty prominent among them.As a whole ""Pet"" just doesn't offer much anything special, even if it isn't terrible. It is suspenseful at times, but not to the point of discomfort like a good horror movie can ratchet it up too. The movie's twists don't land with a lot of weight either, though they aren't awfully done. I'm not a fan of a lot of gore in movies, but the film does have one really violent scene and it works pretty well. But there are also a couple of gross-out scenes that I thought were just cheap. At times ""Pet"" also veers toward wanting to be psycho-sexual, but never achieves much there either. There just isn't anything it does, or tries to do, that other movies haven't done better. If you like horror like me, than it could be worth checking out for some mediocre thrills and suspense, but if you're looking for an actually good movie to scare and/or unnerve you, than this isn't it. 5/10."

And by fell short of the finishing line I mean slipped on a banana peel span 360 backflipped and landed on its head 3 inches from the line in the exact spot Mrs Smiths prized poodle decided to curl one out! I'm not saying Pet is bad I'm just saying it should have been a lot better, a bit longer and with a more satisfying finale.Once again I have to say it was great seeing Ksenia Solo in such a role but feel that had the movie had more competent writers this would have been something worthy of her resume.Also worth noting that the movies characters are simply unlikeable and that damages it somewhat. The movie near opens with a scene which made me hate a character so much I wanted to leap through the TV screen grab the characters mop turn it sideways and shove it where evolution for some reason put the male g-spot.I digress, perfectly watchable effort but should have been so much more than it turned out to be."

Well PET is one of them, an interesting story, but with actors lacking in talent, here at PET only try to do what they are asked, without creativity and even copying scenes from other films, to try to arouse interest, Obviously unsuccessful . There are certain times when they try to convince us of a drama that does not exist, only an ambiguity between being a thriller of terror or a drama of love without deciding for any.

But it kind of reminds other titles like 'Tusk', 'Eyes of my Mother' et cetera. Only thematically. The screenplay should have been improved by extending more dramatic events. At present, it was simple, though the twists were the saviours. Not the mind blowing twists, but for a small storyline like this, everything justified. I liked how film characters switched nature of their roles while story progressing. That was nicely designed characters for a thriller which added a bit of mystery flavour.The character Seth was really interesting one. Drawing a story out of him lacked depth in the later parts. Especially after the first twist revealed. The second half was unexpected, but also that's where the narration stared to fall off the track. One of the reasons was predictable. Though enjoyable film, until the finale. I thought it was overall a better film than I expected, but the end was not any good. Too clich√©. You can easily spot they are interested in a sequel, so they kept it open. But closed conclusion would have made it a decent film.5/10"

The plot thickens, when we learn the girl is a schizophrenic, sociopathic killer, who then manipulates this nitwit to commit the murder of this film's equivalent of Scatman Crothers ( from The Shining ) . After several lengthy, ponderous lectures about love and sacrifice, the filmmakers tried for an ironic twist ending, but it's‚Äã such an obvious twist, that one can see it coming from a mile away. It's also completely implausible, and not believable for a second.Mediocre melodrama, with bursts of violence and bloodshed, the kind of film that should have gone straight to DVD, in the early 2000s, not be shown in a cinema.

On a bus ride he runs into a girl from high school, Holly, who of course doesn't know who he is, still he tries to talk to her. She's more interested in writing in her journal. I guess he either falls for her or becomes obsessed. He visits her soon afterward at the diner she works. There again she pretends or maybe doesn't remember talking to him in the bus. He makes it clear he's interested, she wants nothing to do with him. He follows her to the bar where her ex works. In a brawl with him he manages to grab her journal and reads it.Now he comes up with a plan, he builds a cage in some forgotten room in the basement of the shelter. He kidnaps her and puts her in the cage. He tries not very hard to break her while he claims to be saving her, but of course you know where this is going. These days where the political agenda is universal there are few surprises in movies. When the security guard starts following Seth around he finds Holly and at this point the tables are turned.It's much more difficult to make a psychological thriller than movie-makers are willing to admit. And confining people in a cage or room or house simply doesn't make for a compelling movie. Seth keeps talking about saving Holly for no discernible reason. There some talk about love as expected. Lacking though are thrills. Considering that this is supposed to be a R-rated movie there should have been more excitement all around. But they went for a very soft-R bordering on PG-13. Solo delivers a good performance. They had a concept here, one we've seen before of course, but not enough of a budget to offer more than the a barebones movie."

If you miss it, that's okay, too. Watching it won't enrich your life or give you hope that mankind is redeemable. It's just a little horror flick to pass the time until reboots of ""Saw"" or ""Hellraiser"" gets to the cineplex near you.

Showing that the world is indeed a small place, years later Seth spots Holly on the bus as he's travelling to work and goes over to say hello.

With the brilliant direction of Carles Torrens, this is brought realistically to the screen.The two actors in the main roles are the ones responsible for holding the script and film together as they, and the characters they create, work really well together and are more than credible as two broken people finding a dark and twisted love.This movie is now one of my favourite thrillers and I would recommend it to all lovers of the twisted mind and twisted plots.

Security guard Nate is usually the only one around and nobody can hear her over the animal noises.This has a couple of actors that I like. The first half of the movie struggles to pick up the pace in a seemingly predictable kidnapping film. There is a reveal of something different and more interesting around the halfway point. This may work better to compress the first half and do the kidnapping earlier. Monaghan may also be better off playing it less creepy and more of a good Samaritan. This takes the standard horror and gives it a twist. It has potential but doesn't fully achieve an engaging movie.

I am a big horror fan and am always on the lookout for new survival or zombie, not comedy zombie, and battle of wits. Some of my favorites are the Cube trilogy and Dawn of the Dead. While Pet was a survival movie, I wish there would have been more interaction between the two main characters. Also, a bit more of the underwear shots of her would have been welcomed.

The pace picks up, the story gets into a roller-coaster of emotions. I found myself saying 'oh... really, wow' and 'Oeeh, nice!'.Then when everything became apparent and the truth was revealed, the writers and producers needed to think of an ending. It appears the budget was drained as the ending was muffled in a single scene. Writers were fired by now as the end made no sense, was clich√© and weak. BUT The film started as it ended........The acting is excellent, the story in itself good and the product as a whole absolutely entertaining and worth watching.This movie left with an odd image of me being in a soup kitchen, eating welfare food.

The acting is top notch and believable.This part will not make sense until you see it but the very ending goes against what you would expect from the characters and also disregard the problem of set characters. I did not expected I give them that. There were 2 ending that made sense to me but they went on a 3rd one that was (I believe) was rewritten.All and all except for the last 2 minutes this movie was very good. Like I said well worth the watch."
" Enjoyable yarn with an odd finish!

But you'll find out this for yourself when you see it.Aside from that quibble, it was a well paced and well-acted drama. Latvian lovely Ksenia Solo is a treat for the eyes. Just delightful to look at!Dominic Monaghan plays a rundown geek called Seth. he meets a former fellow student on the bus and tries to kindle a romance the right way... but he's just a bit of a knob so he decides he'll stick her in a cage instead.But his 'pet' has a few surprises of her own and the two play games with each other till the director says that it's time to wrap things up and end it all.There are some genuine moments of tension and the whole thing is a rather understated thriller which does just enough to entertain but really excels at not being bloody annoying with the music and shaky cam!"
" Horrible waste of time...
",-0.743,0.8153,2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"What a movie...If i can even call it one. Everything from acting to whole ""movie"" point, what it is trying to tell us is so badly done that i have never felt such emptiness inside me.Plot? I am not even going to talk about movie ""plot"", because even if i did, there would be nothing i could really say about it. In fact, i am not sure that this movie has a plot. You will just be watching random scenes in hope that it will eventually all make sense, which it never does.Please, show some respect to your valuable time everyone who considers to watch this ""movie"" and just skip it. You are better of doing nothing than seeing this...atrocity."
