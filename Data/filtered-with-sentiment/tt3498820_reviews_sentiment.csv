Of course the best was Spiderman who was both funny and charismatic.As entertaining as the action, I felt the story wasn't as strong as in Winter Soldier. However, it's still a good story that led to awesome fight scenes.For sure one of the best trilogies. 9/10."
" my opinion
",0.0,0.7902,2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,The strongest Marvel movie so far ... I am very enthusiastic ... and Captain America raised my blood pressure when he stood against Stark
" Great for MCU, off topic for comic books
",0.6249,0.923,2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie and story line fit into the MCU well. I enjoyed it when it first came out, and I enjoy it now, really appreciating the character and relationship developments several years later."
" Kinda fun

" It is good, but it is complex and it is important to pay attention to the story.
",0.3716,0.9979,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"It was with pleasure that I saw this film from the cinematographic franchise ""Captain America"". It is a franchise that has given rise to increasingly extraordinary and visually ambitious films. The connection to the previous film, ""Winter Soldier"", is very present, but I confess that I was left with the feeling that it would have been better to see the ""Avengers"" franchise first, in order to better understand the film, and the relational mechanics of the characters. I remember, as I said in other reviews, that the world of comics is a maze that I do not dominate at all.The plot revolves around a tense situation: after having made a lot of victims and material damage in their operations (finally, someone realized this), the Avengers were punished: they either subjected themselves to UN supervision or were considered outlaws. While the leader, Stark, accepts the impositions, Rogers sees them as an unfair limitation and bets on going his way, even if he breaks with his colleagues and, especially, Stark. At the same time, a subplot develops around Bucky Barnes, Rogers' childhood friend, and his mysterious past.The script is complex and full of details, subplots and nuances that can escape our gaze if we are not attentive or do not know the Marvel universe reasonably. I felt that sometimes the development of the script didn't quite know which way to go or what ideas to develop, and that several characters appear because they really had to be there, if only for a couple of minutes. The central core of characters, however, receives a very good treatment and has time to develop. I thought it was a little strange to see Spider-Man among all these people. He looks a little out of place. And in a film so loaded with good and great heroes, I missed a truly charismatic villain who balanced things out a bit.The cast is a real nest of stars: it is huge and full of notable names. Of course, the protagonist is Chris Evans, as Captain America. He is already fully acclimated to this character and knows perfectly what to do, and does his job flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr is the eternal Tony Stark, a character he was born to do and who does in an exceptional way. Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan continue to be excellent, as they were in previous films. Paul Bettany seemed strangely robotic until I realized that he was really playing an android. Chadwick Boseman was excellent, serious and very focused. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, but not brilliant, and the same can be said of Emily VanCamp, in a relatively bland performance. Anthony Mackie showed up little and Don Cheadle just did what he really had to do.Technically, it is a film worthy of Marvel and of the quality to which it has accustomed us: it is an extraordinary and stylish visual show, where every detail has been thought out in a meticulous way to increase the audience's visual and auditory experience. Cinematography is great and the filming work has been wonderfully accomplished. Visual, special effects and CGI work add sparkle, power and visual depth. The editing work was very well done, with precise cuts and great balance. The action scenes, especially the one at the airport, are good and will satisfy the appetite of Marvel fans. The sets and costumes were also very well done and look authentic. The soundtrack is quite good, but I didn't feel it was something that was really in the ear."
" Finally some controversy from Marvel
",0.4215,0.9788,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"It's not politics that got between the Captain and Iron Man - it's the fact that because of his old buddy Captain America chose to antagonise everyone. Oh, and also the fact that he always knows best. It's so exhausting with these movies how they always promote going rogue cuz when you're powerful you always know best and laws don't matter. The only thing I don't get is why everyone labels Tony as arrogant when usually they are both are equally arrogant and think they know best; it's actually the first movie where Tony shows such regard for others and humility to accept that over 100 world leaders might be righteously concerned that 5 people do whatever they please.
I gave it a high rating though, cause for the first time in quite a while a Marvel movie will make viewers think a bit further than the standard black and white reality of the MCU. And because the special effects are great as always :)

" Good
",0.4404,0.9901,2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"This movie uses the theme of collateral damage/accountability in order to pit superheroes against each other. And it mostly succeeds. It creates the divide in a better way. And it was light and used a lot of humour effectively. With so many characters thrown together in the same film, and new ones introduced, it would be so easy to lose track of some of the characters' story development. The writers deserve some praise in this case because they succeeded in keeping all the characters' own storylines going throughout around the main plot. All the avengers are there, apart from Thor and The Hulk - off on their own adventures. As usual the quality of acting is good from the usual suspects. Though it's the couple of new additions that I enjoyed the most. Black Panther was really cool. Spiderman was also refreshing adding some hilarious lines. Ant-Man in the support role comes up with some funny lines. The visuals were very enjoyable. The various action and fight scenes in particular were awesome. They were exciting without becoming cheesy or predictable.The movie isn't perfect tho. A big problem was its length. At 147 minutes it was probably half an hour too long. There are a few of the scenes that dragged on a little too far. I also have a problem with the title. Having seen all the previous Marvel films, I don't think that this had the feel of a Captain America movie. It was much more suited to being an Avengers movie and I can only imagine the lack of Thor and The Hulk is the only reason it wasn't called 'Avengers: Civil War'. During the main fight scene between all the major characters reference was made to people pulling their punches and still being friends. These people are friends and superhero colleagues. They have future movies to make together. At no point did I feel they were ever going to actually kill each other; which slightly takes away from the tension.Overall, CW does very well as a stand-alone movie and also helps set up future movies for various characters. It is a bit too long but there's enough to keep you entertained and keep you guessing about where the story is going. If you enjoy the Marvel universe I'm sure you'll enjoy this instalment."
" Captain america the winter soldier 2.5
",0.0,0.9459,2021-02-19 00:00:00,10,This is basically captain america the winter soldier part 2 you must see the 2014 film it does not tie in with the avengers the 2016 movie is beautifully presented with full blown action. I recommend it highly truly a movie of its time. it will be 10 years old in 5 years as I have written this review in 2021 a true masterpiece
" Real Life Without Being Real Live
",0.0,0.6906,2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a big comics guy nor do I really follow all of the ""super hero"" type movies that seem to be coming out every couple of months or so... at least before the China virus super villain invaded Hollyweird and the rest of humanity. But I really like the Captain America series for its generally pro-America/Liberty/Freedom stance and its ability to tell great stories related to the times we are in without flinching and with only names and fancy uniforms to stand in for the real-world entities they mirror.""Civil War"" is a magnificent embodiment and reflection on our divided political views and the sometimes harsh realities that come with being ""free"" and defeating tyranny: Do we play nice and appease the evil forces in the world for the sake of avoiding potential collateral damage in confronting them now before they get too strong to defeat? Or do we look the other way and pretend the forces of evil aren't there and continuing to grow as we paper over the reality with formal systems of appeasement such as the UN in an attempt to lend credibility to our cowardice? Do we face ridicule and punishment for standing up to evil now even though the inevitable costs of doing so will be high? Or do we keep our mouths shut and hope for the best while knowing that eventually, everything we hold dear will be destroyed if we ignore our consciences? Or do we do the right thing anyway and accept our roles as outcasts and scapegoats in the eyes of the very society we save from itself?This is a pretty serious film about a very serious time in the history of our world which is now. Bravo to the studio and all involved for making such an unflinching piece of ""fiction.""The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I believe that the use of CGI is excessive and distracting. I think a lot of the scenes could have done without it or used some other ""real"" methods to get the same effect. At some point you have to ask if the film is live action or a cartoon. And while it is a mix of both, it relies a little too much on the later. Obviously some scenes could not be done without CGI but many could have been done without it... as with fight scenes between two or more characters which could have been done live action but CGI characters were used instead. This to me is just distracting and it pulls me out of the film. Plus there were some other things that bothered me such as the under-explained absence of The Hulk and this new character ""Cross-Bones"" that, while I know his background, just seems unnecessary, underdeveloped and gets lost in a sea of other much more important and interesting characters.Also, the witty banter, tough-guy (gal) one-liners and super-stylized poses and moves starts wearing thin really quick. It's just too much. Much of the dialog, I'm sure, is designed to inject comic relief but it winds up feeling forced and inappropriate much of the time... like when ""friends"" are fighting and practically trying to kill each other they like to quip back and forth with jokes or comments of admiration on their fighting styles or their snazzy outfits. Just not very appropriate and is in juxtaposition to the serious nature of the situations. Sort of like your oncologist telling you a ""bald guy"" joke while you are dying of cancer. Again, pulls me right out of the film.If they can stop going overboard with the CGI and constant cringe-worthy attempts at tough one-liners and failed comic relief, they will have a great formula for future films. Overall a great movie and well worth the viewing."
" Captivating from start to finish
",0.0,0.9758,2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"From time 0:00:00 I was hooked all the way to 2:27:43, yes that means the entire movie even the credits! This movie has a different tone than other MCU which was a fantastic change of pace and film style. The comedy was great,action was great and acting even greater. STUNNING performances from Sebastian Stan, RDJ, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Chadwick Boseman. Tom Holland did excellent in his first spiderman role. His comedic timing was amazing and his characters lack of awareness was very well done. Paul Rudd also added a light hearted and funny tone to the movie everytime he was on screen. All around fantastic movie, please do yourself a favor and watch it. Definitely top 3 MCU movie. Endgame and Infinity are obviously better but this was very close!"

" Could've been great, but at least it was pretty good
",0.8934,0.9889,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Overall, it kind of bites off more than it can chew, it takes itself a little too seriously, suffers from occasional choppy editing, and features some surprisingly terrible special effects (mainly thinking about the on foot chase scene early on featuring The Winter Soldier, Captain America, and Black Panther.But: the other action scenes are fun (I mean, the airport one is silly and a bit inconsequential, but it's fun in a mindless way), it's paced pretty well, is very ambitious with the number of characters (the balance is honestly pretty good) and the way it sets up some new characters is pretty skilfully done (I like the Spider-Man and Black Panther stuff more on a rewatch, now that I know where those characters do end up going).It's a more than solid, sometimes very fun MCU movies, but it still wouldn't crack my top 10 if I had to rank them all."
" watch it, it's great
",0.6249,0.7964,2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Great movie if you need some serotonin😋great characters, my favorite franchise:)"
" What an absolute joy
",0.5859,0.9973,2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,"Awesome! My new favourite, so far at least.What an absolute joy 'Captain America: Civil War' is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less. Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.It gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.Sebastian Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely. Elsewhere, Paul Rudd's inclusion is amusing.The whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made. As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh?The only 'but' I have for this is the title. It's practically an avengers film. I'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, I get it's the titular character's arc, but I feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than Captain America.That's not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!"
" One of the best Marvel Superhero movie
",0.7906,0.9909,2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Captain America: Civil War is an action superhero movie directed by Joe Russo, Anthony Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Late Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl.This is one of the best Marvel series movie and one of my Favorite. Great cast and characters, superb action scenes with a pinch of humor, commendable VFX and an memorable ending.The team has surely worked on the script and plot of the movie and this is a different plot altogether. The point which is to be noted is that the villain of the movie doesn't has any super power still he created the havoc amongst all the superheroes.Screenplay of the movie was superb and keeps you engaged through out the movie. Acting is the another strong aspect of the movie with some of the best Hollywood actors this department never disappointed. Climax of the movie is good.One of the best Marvel movie with a great plot and good execution"
" Deeply disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.6846,2021-01-07 00:00:00,1,"After focused watching for bloody 147minutes I was expecting a more completed ending! This was a waste of time!
Not recommended! Marvel, shame of you!"
" Baffling
",0.0,0.8519,2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,The way this movie is made you can't pick aside. You feel guilty if you side with Captain America but then you also want to side with To Merica it because you know the truth. Team Tony was just doing what he felt was right but it wasn't right in another case. It shows how the team compete against each other with different sides and different views and it's literally one of the best movies I've ever watched.
" Did no Justice to the graphic novel
",0.5423,-0.631,2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"The script is trash and easily torn apart. There was no passion or heart in the movie, besides Steve's undying love for Bucky. The premise of the Sokovia Accords tearing the avengers apart is faulty. It's basically Captain America wants to protect his friend, while everyone else wants to bring him to him in to face charges. Acting like people only died In Age of Ultron and the opening scene blindly ignores any possible fatalities in the 1st Avengers or any solo films. When fight scenes take place in major metropolitan areas there's going to be collateral damage.Shoving Spider-Man into the movie was bad. Marvel gave us great origin movies of Ironman, Captain America and Thor. Then shoved Spider-Man down our throat. He had little screen time in an already over bloated film. He came across as just the comic relief of team Ironman. Even the twins got more of a backstory and one died in his only appearance.The fight scenes were lacking the quality of previous marvel entries. Acting like trained military would be unable to fire one bullet and strike their target is foolish. Especially when 15 minutes later they can be taken without incident because they were running down the road. The airport fight scene was laughable. No real drama in the entire fight. Black Widows stabbing people in the back fits her comic book character but not the one they built her in the movies and it was never fully explained and felt too quick.The lone highlight was Black Panther. He showed different stages of grief. From anger to acceptance his characters actions actually felt motivated from his loss.Otherwise just a billion dollar cash grab."
" Absolute trash !
",0.0,-0.9593,2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,"Marvel has done some movies which are good, like Ironman series, but this just gets out of any scale of how trash can movie be. I got it, superheroes are superheroes, but this movie is absolute terrible to watch. It's all about fighting in a superhero style which for me as an adult gives anything, not even amusement, just pathetic shameful use of Digital effects. Just putting on a costume transforms human to a rubberized muppet which can take anything. Stopped watching after 45 minutes."
" Bright Copy of Batman V Superman 2016
",0.4404,-0.5994,2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,Everything in this copied from BvS 2016...Every Scene...Plot....i first watch this Before BvS...But when I watch BvS I come to point that Civil war is totally copied from BvS.
" Captain America: Civil War (2016) Review - 9/10
",-0.5994,0.875,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Captain America: Civil War is in my top five MCU films. This is a movie that I'd show to a person whenever they make fun of me for watching superhero movies. There's action, storytelling, amazing performances by all of the cast, and the Russo brothers in the director's seat. This film has just got it all. And the final fight is also one of the best, and emotional, in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe."
" Outstanding movie in the MCU
",0.6124,0.9814,2020-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Captain America: Civil War is a true masterpiece! In the light of 2020, it's even better or maybe disappointing. I'm not really sure. This movie has a really good balance between emotional moments and action. All the characters are really good developed and there are a lot good lines. Of course, it's about two sides in the Avengers group. One side who follows the governments of the world and the other side who wants to do what their feelings are saying, but if you look closely it's about a group of friends with different ideas about good and bad. I'm very positive about it and this was my first MCU movie I had ever seen! So this is really iconic for me personally. Why did I say in the light of 2020 it's a bit a point of discussion? Well, Captain America is so good as gone now, but his biggest group of enemies is still not defeated. This is probably his last movie in the Captain America series, so in my opinion it should have happened in this movie. On the other hand it's better with the knowledge of now. Spider-Man and Black Panther have their entrance in the universe. I think the biggest questionable point of this movie is that this movie really can't stand on itself. Almost all the other MCU movies can."
" Best MCU movie.
",0.6369,0.9278,2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"This film rocks for 3 reasons. 1. It has tons of cool action. 2. The storyline is great. 3. It has dozens of superheroes fighting each other at the same time, you don't see that often and it's very well done. Personally I do hate most of MCU, but this film is great. Even if you don't like MCU I'd recommend giving this a chance."
" Excellent character dynamics
",0.7003,0.9946,2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the ""correct"" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it."
" Entertaining and Funny like a child comic story
",0.8074,0.9915,2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,"The Story and the plot seems to be well set but the depiction and the participation of the characters was sadly very biased. The story could have been far better. No major nomination also proves my point. Some characters who are mightier and significant in the next movies are almost neglected or presented as useless in the story such as Vision, Black Panther and even Ironman. Ironman seems to be unnecessarily depicted to be failure and subdued from its capabilities. There is clear evidence that the entire movie just wants to exaggerate the role and might of Captain America, who is actually nothing more than a physically strong and determined soldier. The entire movie revolves around him while others just appear to fulfill their part of the story. Spiderman seems to act like a comic-jocker like 'The Mask'. He could have been presented far better and responsible. Antman has been admitted to the scene without any reason or cause or justification. Vision seemed to like a funny video game Robot without any significant role in the entire movie. Falcon could have been presented better. He has been presented as like a Pet Dog of Captain America and his role is given much importance over others; I think that is very disgusting as he is actually nothing more than a mechanized flying bird. Overall the movie just revolves around Captain America and proves him to be far superior to all others and overlooks the importance and power of its superheros like Ironman, Vision, Wanda and Black Panther. Hulk and to do nothing with whatever happens in the story; there is no justification for the same."
" don't watch
",0.0,-0.624,2020-10-27 00:00:00,2,"This movie sucks, it's very boring. You can also tell it's acting."
" The only compaint is that the movie is not that deepbut still it has to be the best captain America movie
",0.6369,0.9803,2020-10-21 00:00:00,7,"The movie is too good, it is not that deep or that close to reality but still I totally enjoyed it. It was great to see the that how a different perspective could lead to bad things. Every time you see the movie you get a different view of the situation, in this movie, no one is correct or I should say that everyone is wrong as well as right in their own way.
It's awesome fights sequences are great but only one complaint, which is, I felt that the final fight could have been better, because in the competition 'DC's Batman Vs Superman: dawn of justice' proved to be an underated master piece and it's final fight between batman and superman was actually something that gives you chills but the one in this movie was not up to the mark.
Again Marvel's VFX team did an awesome job in this movie and also the acting done by the cast was flawless. Talking about directory, this movie is directed in a simple way and is easy to understand.
You can't expect anything in the artistic perspective of this movie, it not an a artistic masterpiece and also the tone of the movie was not constant, in some scenes the tone goes a little dark while in some it becomes very light, and also the unwanted comedy ruins some serious moments.
And another thing that I noticed is that the movie did no justice to some characters, like Spiderman, Hawkeye and war machine.The biggest was Spiderman, even after having a character like him they only gave him a very little screen time and also they introduced him as a sidekick, which totally does not justifies the character of Spiderman.
Overall it is a good movie, must watch!"

" One Of The Best Marvel Movies Out There
",0.7906,0.969,2020-09-28 00:00:00,9,"Pros:
1. The costume and set design is brilliantly done. The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland) outfits are especially great, and the Captain America (Chris Evans) suit has progressed since its' conception.
2. The combat is a whole lot smoother and fast-paced than the previous films, and the action scenes (particularly the airport fight scene) are fantastically choreographed.
3. The movies' serious and gritty tone works really well, especially with the fissures in the Avengers only heightening said tone, and vice versa.
4. The mixture of practical effects and CGI, for the most part, looks great, and they helped to ground the film in a certain realism.
5. The score helps to lay a suitably tense and stifling atmosphere, without becoming stifling itself.
6. All of the Avengers (both the characters and the actors) have brilliant chemistry with each other.
7. The introductions of Spiderman and Black Panther are amazing, as they're given actual story-arcs which are compelling.
8. Both Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/ Tony Stark) and Tom Holland deliver fantastic performances.
9. The last fight scene between Captain America, Iron Man, and Bucky Barnes/ Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is one of the rawest and emotional scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pulled off greatly.Cons:
1. There are a couple wonky CGI moments. For example, when Captain America starts running on the motorway in Germany.
2. Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/ Scarlet Witch) puts on a distractingly bad Russian accent."

",-0.5994,0.9343,2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"Captain America:Civil War is a fine example of what the Russo Brothers are capable of, but still bringing in to the silver screen the comic that saved Marvel Comics in the begininng of the century from bankrupt with a massive number of super heroes fighting for their side, is something fenomenal yet here we saw in my opinion very few heroes battling each other no fault on this is on the Russo Brothers just a movie too soon of it's time, but in the other hand the introduction of the Sokovia accords has the main reason that the team separated is a interesting new point of view."
" Just more boring, garbage from Marvel.
",0.0534,0.7717,2020-09-15 00:00:00,1,"Just another movie for the simple minded. Stereotypical, American action films, with no plot, explosions, and bright, pretty colors. Marvel is complete trash that's made for kids."
" In my opinion, the most disappointing MCU film
",-0.5413,-0.9973,2020-09-11 00:00:00,1,"Captain America: Civil War was one of the most disappointing movies in recent years for me. It was released in the same year as Batman v Superman, and although that movie was bad too, this one for me was even worse. I'll go through a quick plot analysis in order to point out some of the stupid things this movie does and then I'll give a general thought about why this movie is so bad. So, if you haven't seen the movie you can skip this and continue reading after the plot analysis.Plot analysis:The movie opens with the year 1991 when The Winter Soldier was shown to being programed in some way. Keep that in mind dear reader because it will be important later. Then it is shown he hijacked a car in order to steal some science stuff. Keep that in mind too dear reader. Next we see the ""New"" Avengers fighting Crossbones and at the end Crossbones detonates himself but Wanda encapsulates him in a sphere of force field or something and tries to have him lifted up in order to be released in the open air so that innocent people aren't killed in the explosion. But that fails and Crossbones detonates near a building, because Wanda couldn't think of a better way of lifting him in the sky than near a crowded building. So naturally Cap is sad and Wanda is crying. But I'm like: ""Why wasn't a scene like this brought up until now? Why is this so obvious that is going to happen here in this movie beacause the title of the movie is ""Civil War""?"" Why is something like this only brought up now? Why wasn't something like this shown in Age of Ultron? You see the problem here? There is no build-up to this point. There is no sence that things like this were happening while The Avengers were fighting bad guys so that here it reaches a boiling point, because the script in that movie was too concerned with one-liners. So naturally I didn't care about that. Later on when the whole thing about Sokovia accords comes in play there's a scene with Tony and a random woman, who tells Tony that a kid died in the Sokkovia battle with Ultron and that this is the Avengers' fault, even though they were clearly trying to help back then thousands of innocent people. And why wasn't that brought up earlier in other movies? Oh yeah... because the title of this movie is Civil War and we need a way to split the Avengers into two sides right? And we couldn't do that in tiny bits until this movie so... that's that. Then The Avengers fight over the Sokkovia accords so that basically means Tony vs Cap. Then Maggie dies and Cap is sad. Then T'Challa's father dies and he too is sad but also angry at Bucky. Then Bucky and Cap get ambushed by Black Panther so Bucky and Panther fight. Then there are more arguments between Tony and Cap. Then a guy named Zemo comes to where Bucky was incarcerated and speaks some rusian words that trigger Bucky to go crazy. Wait what??? How did he knew those words? Remember dear reader that at the begining I told you that there was a scene with Bucky being programmed? Well this is what he was programmed for. To be activated like a robot through some rusian words. Like... how? This feels just like a plot device to move one of our main protagonists into a place where he could kick start the plot again because the writters literally couldn't have thought of a better way to kick start the plot again. It's like a McGuffin for cheap writting. So Bucky escapes, Cap helps him and then Bucky tells Cap that he is not the only Winter Soldier. Wait... what? Like how? How was that never brought up or hinted ever again in previous movies? It's like the writters are making this up as they go along. Then Tony goes to Peter Parker because he somehow knew about Peter and this is totally not the writters trying to get Spider-Man into the MCU. His presence in this movie felt just as natural as Wonder Woman's presence in Batman v Superman. So Tony recruits Peter into his team in order to fight Team Cap. Then Wanda breaks out from Tony's protection because she suddently agrees with Cap. Wait what? Never mind... moving on... Then Cap gathers his team too and they all fight at an airport in Leipzig. That fight has to be one of the most over the top, riddiculous and annoying fights in the MCU. Almost everything is cut short due to short one-liners. Even Black Widow fights Hawk-eye and they talk about them being friends after this fight which begs the question again: Why are you fighting when all you are worried about is if you guys are going to be friends after this? I won't even start on how this movie breaks every single rule of what the movie Ant-Man made about shrinking and enlarging. Like if you enlarge a toy truck, isn't the big truck supposed to be just as light as the toy truck? And yet this movie doesn't care about that detail and shows the truck being like an ordinary huge and heavy one, just so we could have an explosion and a fear that War Machine might be in trouble. So the fight ends with Rhodey getting hurt in the back and the Team Cap getting busted. But then Tony searches for clues about the other Winter Soldiers and realizes that Cap was right, so basically all the fight about Bucky was pointless. Wow, nice one script, nice way of saying ""Nah, it'll be fine"" and basically undo all the catarsis I had about that fight. I wonder if what comes next is pointless or not... hmm... ? So Tony goes to a warehouse where the Winter Soldiers were being held and where Cap waits for him but where Zemo somehow prepared a video on a computer... wait what? ... where it shows that Bucky killed Tony's parents while being programmed in that scene in the begining of the movie. Remember that from the begining of the review dear reader? So, somehow there was a camera in the middle of nowhere to film at the exact angle how Bucky killed Tony's parents. And above that... isn't this too convenient that this information was never brought up until now? Like there is no hint throughout the other movies that Tony's parents death was a mistery which no one knows and that someone with superpowers was involved. This thing is literally made up on the way to give Tony reason to fight Cap and Bucky. But in the end that doesn't even matter because Cap writes Tony a letter in which he appologises and everything is back to normal. Roll Credits.End of Plot analysis.Now, trying to summarize all the problems of this movie is like trying to eat an all-you-can-eat buffet with a pair of sticks. There is firstly, the countless informations that are brought up only in this movie that were nowhere mentioned in other MCU movies before. Then there is the awkward humor that basically ruins almost every single supposedly good moment of the movie. Then there are the countless informations made up as the plot goes along just to raise the stakes and keep the plot going. Then there are the rules made by other movies in the franchise that are basically broken and never held on to. And lastly there is the lack of consequence after the events of this movie. One could argue that the same thing applies to Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that movie is about redeeming Bucky and by the end everything that happens firstly destroys Hydra and then what Cap does for Bucky leaves a mark on him and he gets shoock up by the events so he becomes the old Bucky again by the end of the movie. You see, that movie actually has a character arc for Bucky, being called righlty so ""The Winter Soldier"", however what a character arc does this movie have for any of it's characters? One could argue also that this fracture between the Avengers is necessary for Infinity War to work but in that movie this is only brought up in one line and no character behaves like there is a fracture between the Avengers. Man, even Cap goes to Rhodey in Infinity War and everything is like Civil War never happened. By the end of that movie almost everything is as it was before the movie. And that's the problem. Nothing that happens in this movie has any impact ont what's to come next in the MCU so is hard to get invested and care about what happens or is happened, mainly in retrospect after you've seen the end of Infinity Saga. So tu put it in other words, this movie is basically pointless. And you know what makes me even angrier when I talk to or hear people talking about this movie? That most of them see it as The Dark Knight of Marvel movies and hold it up as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It just makes me wonder how can so many people love this movie and consider it as one of MCU's best movies when in fact this movie is just a giant made-up as we go along mess that tries to set up things for future movies but actually achieves nothing because nothing is this movie actually matters. And that is what it basically boils down to for me: Civil War is a lackluster, pointless, tensionless, boring, pretentious and overblown monster of a movie that has no consequences, no character arcs, no stakes and no powerful story or lessons to take from. Even the technical aspects of the movie are bad, CGI is obvious (Tony's neck inserted to the Iron-Man suit), the soundtrack is patethic and the acting is atrocious mainly due to the oddly placed humor. So is there anything good to be taken from this movie? Well, yeah, it shows just how good other superhero movies are in comparison, and those movies came like 8 years before in the likes of The Dark Knight or Iron-Man. 1/10 from me."
" Great payoff for MCU fans
",0.6249,0.9984,2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: Civil War is a movie that pits the Avengers against each other over the issue of registering with the UN. It combines some of the best aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to develop character arcs that have been going on for several movies now. At the same time, I think the movie is a bit bogged down and the main character, Captain America, tends to get a bit lost in the shuffle.There's two major plotlines going on in the movie. First is the Civil War story line, which focuses on the Avengers fighting over registering with the UN. The second story line continues from the Winter Soldier, Bucky is on the run and has been framed for the death of the King of Wakanda by the villain Baron Zemo. Helping Bucky and not signing up with the UN has pitted Cap against Iron Man.The movie definitely plays more like an Avengers movie rather than a Captain America movie (I've heard this movie called Avengers 2.5). Iron Man gets a lot of screen time here, and the movie introduces Black Panther and Spider-man. I'm not opposed to the movie going for a larger ensemble, since Cap himself gets developed over the Avengers movies as well, but it does feel like there's too much going on here. The two story lines have enough meat on their bones to be their own movies. They do interesting things with these story lines and arcs though, and the movie really wants you to see both sides of the argument. You can empathize with both major characters and that is great, it really sells the Civil War idea. On top of that what I really love about that idea is that it feels like a natural point in their character arcs, based on previous movies. Baron Zemo though doesn't get much screen time and he's largely forgettable outside of a couple scenes at the end.I watched this movie right around the time Chadwick Boseman died (RIP) and so I want to take a minute to talk about him specifically. Black Panther has a great little arc here and probably stands out the most among all characters, save for Cap and Iron Man. He doesn't say a lot, but makes that silence part of his character and works great as a counterpoint to the Avengers, really a breath of fresh air for the team. I'm really sad that he passed and wish we could get more of him.The visual effects are great here, no surprise. The Super heroes are colorful and the set pieces are big end explosive. There's a lot of big action here with lots of color powers and none of it clashes visually and its not hard to see whats going on. The Russo Brothers have an eye for cinematography and know how to fit big ensembles within a shot without audience getting lost. The musical score is your usual MCU flair, nothing really to note here.Overall, this is one of my favorite MCU movies. There's a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, so I think they largely smooth out a script that is a bit messy. It's a lot of fun at the movies and great pay off for being invested in the MCU for many years and many movies. Not as tightly written as the Winter Soldier, but the movie is so big and has so many great character moments I might like this movie better. I'd recommend it to all fans of Super hero movies, but it requires previous investment in both Captain America, Avengers and Iron Man movies."
" Another great addition to the captain America movies
",0.6249,0.9868,2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,It is very fun and entertaining. The story of the film is great. The screenplay keeps you hooked. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The performances of the entire cast are amazing. They introduce many new superheroes which makes it a lot more fun. Definitely worth a watch for all marvel movie lovers.
" A fantastic start for Phase 3!
",0.5983,0.9616,2020-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Marvel's Captain America Civil War is one of my Top 3 favorite MCU movies ever. It's a great start to Phase 3, and I loved how it deals with the fallout of Age of Ultron and previous MCU flicks.
Great action, great story, great acting from an all star cast, great effects. Zemo's a great villain, and I liked how he's a different kind of antagonist. I loved the airport battle, but the final battle between Cap, Bucky, and Iron Man is just amazing!! It was from that point on that the MCU will never be the same!! It sets up Infinity War and the rest of Phase 3 very well!! Captain America: Civil War's my favorite movie in the Captain America trilogy."

" Great Kids Movie. Expensive Toy Commercial. And That's It!
",0.6588,-0.8514,2020-08-10 00:00:00,6,"Back when this mammoth of a movie was released, I was not really impressed with it as a whole, but I liked the action, set pieces and parts of the story. I originally saw it as badly written, expensive fan service meant to sell a lot of toys, and for manbabies to overobsess about it for months, like they always do.I rewatched it recently, and apart from a few scenes, I find it hard to enjoy as a whole even now. However, I realized 'Civil War' isn't badly written - it's written for gullible kids as the main audience in mind. I was disappointed with myself for setting high expectations on a toy commercial.The writing is atrocious, but I was still surprised, since McFeely & Markus wrote 'Captain America: The First Avenger', a movie with a way better story and tighter script. The dialogue switches from childish and inane to preachy and pompous. The directing is what it is; I didn't expect much from the 'Community' guys. The 2nd unit team did a hellova great job with the action scenes though.The color grading is so boring and uninspired for a supposedly colorful comic book movie; hence why the 1st 'Captain America' is supreme. The constant change of locations is a cheap copout for lack of engaging storyline. As is the segment with Pepper Pots, the dead relief workers in Sokovia. And let's not talk about the supposedly closed society of Wakanda. Or letting terrorists like Cpt. America walk free.I deeply disliked the inapt shoehorning in of Black Panther, it was unnecessary, but it wasn't as bad as his mentally challenged character with no depth. The entire movie is a glorified, expensive toy commercial. As a whole, it's dumbed down for mass consumption and often I rolled my eyes so hard, I got an aneurysm. Not worth another rewatch."

After the Avengers save the world several times they are reminded that all the battles leave a lot of destruction and many people have died. So the governments of the world devise the Sokovia Accords as a way to keep the team in check. Still sick with the guilt of creating Ultron, Stark jumps on board with hesitation, as do Rhodes, and Romanoff (don't know if Vision was required to or not). Rogers and Wilson are completely against the idea.
All of the sudden,, Bucky comes back into the public eye.
T'Challa, the prince of Wakanda, is much more than he appears to be.

" Captain America: Civil War
",-0.5994,0.9985,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: Civil War, directed by The Russo Brothers, had some BIG shoes to fill after The Winter Soldier, and they absolutely exceeded expectations, pushing the MCU films to new heights! Undoubtedly, Civil War is a huge fan service film, but that doesn't discourage the fact that this film is one of the best of the saga, thus far, having so many relatable themes, and memorable scenes. The Russo Brothers set this intriguing, serious tone for the majority of the film, creating amazing tension between the characters, while they interwove their brilliantly written humor. The Russo Brothers do such a great job keeping the continuity going from The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger, while also tying into the saga beautifully, setting up some great exposition. One of my main issues I have with Civil War; Not that there is so much going on, but the way they structured and balanced the scenes. The way the scenes were set, it didn't make the sequences feel as cohesive as they could've, with some plots becoming underdeveloped.Even though this is a story-driven film, The Russo Brothers, Stephen McFeely & Christopher Markus allowed for countless, brilliant character moments, allowing each character to shine, and get a little more depth. Every character's motive is understood and fleshed out well, because of the good writting, and the set up films prior, giving every character a few more layers. The only issue I had with the characters, is that the creative team set themselves for some balancing issues, strictly due to the additions of a couple of cameo characters, but they made the absolute best of it. With this being a Captain America film, you know he's going to have a lot on his plate, and the writers and Chris Evans handled and balanced everything great! His character was the main focus, being really well written, expanding on his genuine bond with the team, and reaching a new level of ""banter"" with Tony Stark. His argument was described so well, where you can whole heartily get behind him, and completely back him up. Tony Stark runs the same lines. His character was another main focus, being well written, and having the best character arch of the film. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role once again, being a stand-out, in someone else's movie. Tom Holland ABSOLUTELY CRUSHES his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man! This is such a fresh take on his character, being nailed to a T! Tom Holland seemed to get almost all of the best lines, stealing every single scene he's in! Holland brings an extreme likability to the character, and I can't wait for his solo film! Chadwick Boseman also gets introduced into the MCU, as the Black Panther, and he is another stand-out of this film! His character is also well written, having a nice character arch, being one of those characters you can instantly care for. Boseman puts on a great performance, proving he belongs in the MCU! We get one of the most highly anticipated characters, make his return, in Paul Rudd as Ant Man. He doesn't have much to do, but he makes the most out of all of his screen time! Scarlett Johansson returns as Black Widow, and returns as one of the most grounded of the character bunch. Her character gets a little more importance here, but she doesn't have that much characterization. Elizabeth Olsen favorably returns as Wanda Witch, having one of the best potentials coming into the film. McFeely and Markus tried to give her some importance, but her character was sadly sidelined, compared to everyone else. Paul Bettany runs the same lines as Wanda, getting a little more to do, but I needed more from the both of them. Sebastian Stan, Don Cheadle, and Anthony Mackie all return as their respected characters. They all had their minimal time to shine, but they were just left in the background, for the most part. Helmut Zemo is in the top three for most controversial villains of the MCU. I believed that Zemo had a purpose in this film, being a subtle villain, but if they were to scratch his character, the narrative wouldn't really change all that much, if anything, it would probably tighten up the narrative.The screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, shines in most aspects, but they could've trimmed down some things, and gave it to the characters that needed that extra time to develop. If they did that, and maybe added another decent risk, or two, this film would be close to flawless.With the action being handled by The Russo Brothers, you know it's going to be a hit, but this was a grandslam! They incorporated so many great shots, with the right amount of shaky cam, being one of the most notable films for the action. The Russo Brothers always know how to bring tention during these action sequences, and it was handled extremely well.Overall, Captain America: Civil War, is probably my second favorite MCU film, and I think it's more than fair to say that this is a film that belongs at the top of the list"
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.6808,2020-08-05 00:00:00,5,"This film seems like an excuse to pit the main characters against each other outside an Avengers film. Just like the other Captain America films, he relies on these other characters to push the story along, which is a big weakness of his character. In this case it doesn't really work as it is rather forgettable. Although the special effects are good, the action itself is messy and uninspiring."

The international community has already voted yes. If Avengers say no, they are in breach of international law. If they say yes, they are not. Obviously they should say yes, because if the international community asked them to do something they didn't want to do, they could still refuse and breach the law. The question is just should we decide right now to breach the law, or wait until a problem comes up?"

Easily the best choreography and fight scenes of any Marvel movie so far. Every other Avengers movie so far has a lot more space type action where the action scenes in this one seem more realistic because it's all Earth type foes and friends clashing. The acting brought tears to my eyes in certain moments because it goes straight to the heart. It's easy to forget about this particular movie because of all the other huge blockbuster Marvel movies that have come out within the short time span, but this may be my favourite of all of them: 10/10"

" Capt America Was in the Wrong
",-0.4767,-0.1779,2020-07-01 00:00:00,7,"After the assassination in Vienna, Capt America's actions likely killed dozens of civilians and destroyed much of the city, just to keep his mass-murderer of a friend alive. I took points off the movie for this, as it fundamentally violated the Capt's #1 intention: to save lives. At the same time, however, his actions throughout the movie were emblematic of America's military as a whole. The US military, and police, oftentimes have this patriotic entitlement that they are always righteous, when in reality they are oftentimes harming the innocent.The action in the movie was great as always, and the theme of vengeance and how it can eat away at people was well articulated. However, I felt that Ironman was clearly in the right throughout the movie. The Avengers' actions have killed probably hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent civilians at this point, so the fact that half of the Avengers couldn't sign on to a peace agreement was a bit ridiculous. And I don't think their stance was justified. Side note, Black widow is awful for betraying Tony. Spider-Man and T'Challa are awesome additions.In conclusion, this is probably one of the better marvel movies, but it's still not in the upper tier with the 2 Guardians movies, Black Panther, Infinity War, Thor Ragnarok, the original Ironman, etc..."

What did you EXPECT you idiot superheroes?? Wasn't that what you were trying to do? This is every bit as nonsensical as Batman v Superman but got critical acclaim piled on it because it's Marvel.The characters honestly act so infantile it's infuriating. Their fighting could have been avoided if an actual adult like Nick Fury was there to deal out corner time.Shaky cam during the mediocre action scenes because the Russo bros are actually hacks, but shhhh, don't tell anyone. And if you look it up you'll see that the so-acclaimed airport fight was shot by second-unit directors. (Again, Russo bros are hacks.)This was the first Marvel movie where RDJ looked tired and bored to be there. As he would in every one afterwards.I did not appreciate the ripping off of the Manchurian Candidate and then name-dropping it, as if that makes the ripping off okay."
" Avengers 2.5 is my Top Favourite MCU Film

The dialogues are so rich and filled with easter eggs, reference to older films and sets up that I find something new everytime I rewatch.This movie got us Black Panther and Spider-man, Russos and MM got them so right. T'Challa had a arc for vengeance while parallely Stark was beating Cap for vengeance for parents & Zemo was also taking revenge, its a story about multiple revenge stories interlinked with smart storytelling. 'Vengence has consumed you, it is consuming them, and I am done letting it consume me'.Peter Parker was perfect, smart way to introduce with Tony but Sony played with Tony~Uncle Ben too much. Spider-man leaving quips, movie reference and taking taking taking throughout fight sequence, teen-ager looking to impress Stark. The first thing Peter said when he heard he got selected as a Stark Intern was ask if it was paid, classic Peter.Vision line of 'Our very own strength invites challenges, challenges incites conflict, conflict breeds catastrophe' is the most underrated line in history or MCU, party because it is long but I have it memorised. #MCUnerdNow about the real deal
If you look at Steve and Tony from a 3rd perspective, they both are right and wrong at the same time, flawed characters. Tony was driven by fear in Ultron now he is driven by Guilt. Captain America lost hope in institution because his SHIELD was inflantrated by Hydra. Their roots of motivations arises from the progression these characters have been taking from their past films. I loved their arguments in Avengers 1 but here it crosses the line for the final battle.Peggy dieing and Sharon Carters words of Peggy saying to stand on your ground for Cap to inspire, hits hard. Black Widow betraying Tony to let escape Steve was worth it as she knows where Steve is coming from.Scarlet and Visions love story grows a little bit more, while other side characters like Ant-man being for laughs, Clint to pit against his classic Widow and Rhodey injury feels hard but him dieing would have been much better for more consequences of actions.The registration act feels natural given the amount civilians death from past films. The airport sequence is iconic and I love that the characters are fighting but still pulling their punches, they were friends now are fighting against each other.Tony as villain is believable but you feel bad for him at the end. Zemo on the other hand is one of my favourite MCU villains, love how he pulls all the strings and he succeeds to break the avengers apart, also making way for Thanos to win. This plan is always 1 step ahead but his plans seems too much fictional if you step back and thing about everything, its a con but the other great things I gets from this movie just blows this point away.One major nerdy point, this movie had multiple times say ' Mission report, December 16, 1991' Dec 16 being Starks parents death while in Iron Man 1 (2008) showed a newpaper saying Starks died on Dec 17, this just proves people making this movies actually cares about these characters and wants to make quality movies and not just cashgrabs. Every single character gets there moment to shine and doesn't get neglected by the big cast."
" Are superhero films really that different to real life affairs?
",0.0,0.9425,2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Other than a few well choreographed action sequences and a solid performance which was was bound to be good with a cast like that, Captain America: Civil War was just not that great. For example: The Russo's are said to have created some of the best marvel films, however in Civil War the cinematography and dialogue were both very simple and lackluster.Before watching the film, I really liked the concept of there not being a big, mystical, bad guy that would typically disband a team of superheroes. But better yet it's the teams dynamic and conflict between one another that ultimately leads to the teams end, its a slight change to the marvel film formula and that's one reason why I didn't rate it lower.Now, instead of focusing on the technique, I want to focus on how this film can be seen as something we see in reality. The question I want to put forward us, how much good do the people that are meant protect (heroes in the films case) us really do? In any superhero film, it can be inferred that being a superhero means you have a special, unprecedented amount of power with little to no accountability if something were to go wrong. Does this sound familiar? I consider superhero films to be the furthest thing to our reality, imagine seeing a strong person throwing a metal disc at aliens, but the are some parallels which are uncanny. Going back to my point about accountability, everyday we see police who aren't accountable for their inhuman actions, but is this not also the behaviour of team cap in Civil War."

You've seen it before in other movies and maybe in real life, so that part of the plot is good.However I collected comics and knew of all these arcs and cross arcs of various characters and the Civil War story. Granted comic are better because they force the reader to use their imagination to fill in the missing scenes and the fight scenes are far better in my imagination than any CG movie filled with all the latest technological special effects. However, I'll give credit for what they did and I thought the fight scenes were pretty good.There are a lot of creative license used through out the movie. I don't think they fully understand that even though you are a super hero, you can't break the laws of physics. So for that I punish the movie.The movie climaxes at the end with a major fight scene which is everything. The whole movie rests on that one scene. I personally thought it could have been better but for what they did, it was good.The cinematography is great. The direction is good. The special effects are great. The characters, the main ones are played to their fullest, the supporting cast is MEH. I do not like Vision. He is nothing like the comic or my imagination. I did not care at all for the way he was presented and I do not know if it was the actor or director to blame.I don't care for Zemo.Zemo is a far more complex and detailed character to just give this little bit of screen time. You could make a whole series of movies just about the Zemo Family Tree. That's why I dislike about this movie, they have taken creative license to squeeze too much in to one movie. This movie could have been TWO movies and still not covered all the plot.I don't care for how Buck is presented.Buck has been transformed in to something more than what he was in the comic and as I said before the physics used in these movies is all wrong. His fight scenes are clumsy and too choreographed. I didn't care for how Capt America and he reconciled. It's too crammed together for the big screen.I do not care for all the personalities in the movie. Every one is trying to get screen time, the comic had a better representation of them and this is why this movie should have been two movies and not one. Like, Wanda and Vision's relationship. It was far more complex than two scenes where they have dialog and show their relationship.I don't care for Aunt May. No excuses. She isn't that young and never should be so. They did it just to create some love side interest stories. I think it is BS.Overall, it's a OK movie. I liked it better than Endgame or"

It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move.

The simple fact that we even get movies like these is still insane to me. What I love most about Civil War, however, is the great conflict that drives the story. It isn't just fan service for fan service's sake ; the characters each have their own motivations and backgrounds that lead them to a certain position in the conflict, and the Russo brothers do a great job at exploring both sides of the argument.This is easily one of the best MCU movies to date."

Film companies always do this thing where if they create teams of good guys they more or less make it a draw so that no one watching feels disappointed when the team they were routing for loses.

The New Warriors aren't the cause here: the Avengers are.That being said, the action scenes are decently done, and the central conflict between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers is well acted.

" Super friends battle over principle
",0.6597,0.427,2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"When superheroes battle their evil counterparts, there is almost always major collateral damage. It is a rare occasion when they meet in a remote area such as the Sahara Desert. These battles also often include the deaths or serious injury of innocent bystanders. Concerned about this, governments around the world have banded together under the United Nations banner to write a series of regulations governing the superhero group the Avengers.
Captain America (Steve Rogers) is opposed to signing the new law while Iron Man (Tony Stark) is strongly in favor. This creates a major rift in the Avengers with the others being forced to take sides. At first the conflict is verbal only, but there is an incident where it breaks out into open conflict. Hence the term ""Civil War."" It is superhero against superhero in a battel that shatters unity and leads to hostility and serious injury. Tony Stark is torn when he visits the penal facility where some of the Avengers are being held under special and very restrictive controls.
The action is intense with a great deal of hand-to-hand fighting. It would seem unlikely that Captain American would stand a chance against the armored Iron Man, but he holds his own. Punches and other items are thrown, bodies fly and there is some literal blood drawn. The dialog is also very good, while there are a few instances where a cliché is dropped, they are very rare.
Two high points of the dialog were very amusing. When Tony Stark is trying to convince Peter Parker (Spider-Man) to leave town and aid him in his task of rounding up the renegade Avengers his response is, ""I can't, I have homework."" The second is the cameo by legend Stan Lee. He plays a deliveryman with a package for ""Tony Snark."""

The United States team is the embodiment of very justice , he believes in truth, goodness and beauty, he believes in the kindness of winter soldiers (in fact, winter soldiers are indeed manipulated by Hydra). Winter soldier is the only person in the world that the United States team has known since before he went to sleep, a spirit that no one can replace. A lot of people say the United States team is selfish, I don't think so. The Black Widow finally helped the United States team and the winter soldiers leave, so many people on the captain's side, not just a large number of people, but said that the captain's justice and salvation were accepted by more people.
And Iron Man, uh, only wanted to catch the winter soldier, and his conceit in the positive film made him not see the truth of the facts.
After reading the third book, it is heartache in two words. Why is the heartache?
The fight between the American team, the winter soldier and the Iron Man, of course: the captain wanted to protect the winter soldier, Tony wanted revenge for killing his parents, and Tony was angry because the captain knew about it and didn't tell himself. It was a good show for a good brother to die.At the end, when Tony was alone and lonely, he received a letter from the captain. The captain's magnetic voice softened my heart.Fight is hit, emotional injury broken, but as long as you need them to need me, we will be with you to fight with you.That's how heartache it is.

However, I gave it a chance and do not regret it at all. I really enjoy Marvel's now. I always liked Captain America and really enjoyed the first avenger even more than any single super hero like Ironman, Hulk or Thor. The return of the first avenger is even better but this Civil War is great and I really enjoy it. However, it is slightly less as enjoyable to me than the other two captain america movies. The reason more due to Ironman and the producers Kevin Feige who seems to have an affinity with Germany and Europe. He implements a lot of unnecessary and ridiculous commercials for Audi a German automobile manufacturer and for Europe itself. Ironman tells Spider-Man how great Germany is or he would enjoy Paris. Well, Ironman is supposed to be an American super hero and Marvel's are American productions so why not implement Chrysler or something like that to foster American automobile manufacturers. European dislike America and I was born and raised in Germany so I know that besides the beer and a little vacation Germany sucks. So does Paris who is more an Arabic style city than anything else. Kevin Feige is trying to implement this multinational diversity perspective that America is not as good but others are. Germany even had to scrap the name captain america of the title so people would go to the theater. After bad revenue and critics of the captain america the first avenger they realized that they need to change the title to the return of the avenger- winter soldier and civil war. So why are they hyping Europe? This is my only critic which keeps getting annoying. Other than that awesome flick"

Even watching it a second time I was waiting eagerly to see this scene again.Captain America and his story seemed to play second fiddle to the over arching civil war. His romance was a bit a of a waste time, especially in the fact that his love story has hardly any return in the next few MCU movies. His bromance with Bucky was interesting enought to keep watching over the length of two movies.The humour was relatively absent from any scenes including Captain America. The only laughs to be had were when other characters were in the scene.Ironman almost gets more character development than Captain America through learning to submit and not be so proud. How does Captain America change as a result of this movie? He has asserted himself as a capable leader and a sacrifical friend. But I had hoped for a bit more.

" Another let down if not action-packed
",0.0,-0.985,2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"After the success of Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers return for the third installment of captain America's adventures. Only this time they didn't quite seem to have their finger on the pulse in my opinion. Let us hope they get their act together quickly for the next Avengers film as Whedon will be sorely missed in the directors chair.The writing duo of Markus and McFeely also return having written the two previous films and that could been seen as good or both depending on you look at it. You're mileage will vary here but for me the writing on show here is on a par with The First Avenger and nowhere near the quality of The Winter Soldier. As with the russo's, let's hope they also pull their finger out for the next Avengers film but right now, I'm not entirely optimistic about it.So onto The Winter Soldier: Part 2, we open to the frozen plains of Siberia and see a little more a secret facility used after the war. We see Bucky (Stan reprising his role) locked into a mechanical contraption where we (now already know) he was brainwashed. A red book with a star on the cover is being used to give him trigger keywords and phrases in order to indoctrinate him for his next mission.Back into the real world of the present day, our hero Steve Rogers (Evans) is communicating with Romanoff (Johansson), Wanda (olsen) and Falcon (Mackie). The Institute for infectios disieses is being targeted and stormed by soldiers who are after a bological weapon. Steve and his team jump into action and unfortunately innocents are killed by Wanda which causes worldwide conflict regarding the actions of the Avengers and whether or not they should be held liable for damages.The United nations come up with the Sokovia Accord (basically a hero registration act to be finalised in Vienna, based upon the destruction in Age of Ultron) which will basically be a ruling body for the Avengers. Naturally this doesn't sit exactly well with some of them causing internal conflicts and a rift within the group, fracturing them to the point of disaster. Stark is all for signing while Rogers wants nothing to do with it. Unfortunately an act of terrorism on the UN building sends things sprialling out of control.And that is the crux of the movie moving forwards as we deal with two teams of Avengers (those for and against the Accord) with a major side story involving Rogers and Bucky. I personally found Rogers going completely rogue to save a brainwashed bucky was a little silly and just not something I can see him doing even for a friend (who tried to kill him remember) and this really should have been called The Winter Soldier 2 rather than Civil War as that is what the film really comes across as. It's a strange mish-mash of a direct sequel to both Ultron and Winter Soldier. Great for continuity I guess but not so great as a film in its own right.Having already mentioned the screenplay and having touched upon the direction, this really is a let down when compared to the films it is trying to continue with. Effects and photography are not bad (this is Marvel after all) but there is nothing really special to get excited about or thrill you. In fact with regards to those, the blurry close up cam is very annoying this time around especially during fight scenes but thankfully it does improve somewhat towards the middle before becoming annoying again. And bearing in mind there is only really two big set-piece action scenes, this does detract from viewing enjoyment.Running with the Winter Solder: Part 2 theme, the whole controlling bucky to wreak havoc and chaos has also been done to death in The Winter Soldier, why go over it again as it really wasn't needed. Simple convenient plot point to me to move the story forward with a 'villian' who really doesn't have enough screen presence and how he 'orchestrates' his whole master plan of destroying those who destroyed what he held dear himself is rather laughable really and quite feeble storytelling. It could have been done so much better, or better yet, a completely different storyline would have helped.If you have been watching the WHiH webisodes then you know about General Ross (William Hurt) becoming the Secretary of State and he makes a brief appearance purely for continuities sake. We also get our first appearances of Black Panther (good casting with Boseman) and more information regarding Wakanda, as well as Peter as Spider-Man to lead to future films and stories. Ant-Man, Paul bettany as Vision along with Cheadle and Renner (as War Machine and Hawkeye respectively) also make appearances and we finally say goodbye to legendary Agent Peggy Carter.We get more hints that Black Widow may actually know Bucky (which may or may not lead into the stoyline regarding the long rumoured Black Widow solo film) and the only other real talking point is the teams. Interesting personally because as much as love Iron Man and Black Widow, Rogers has been growing on me (prior to this film at least), plus he has Scarlet Witch, so it's a tick for team America here for this critic. Though in the reality of the universe, it should be such a one-sided fight that it isn't even funny. Team Iron wins every damn day. Film wise, it is an excellently directed and choreographed fight scene with some nice comedy thrown in.As for that Marvel trademark wit, it is largely missing here and only really starts with the introduction of our favourite web-slinger. Most of the comedy revolves him along with Ant-Man (who isn't around that much at all either). In the end unfortunately this is a little like a very dull Avengers film with all the good key elements of Joss whedon missing. Not a bad film by any stretch but certainly not up to Marvel's, or the previous Captain America films standards.

",0.0,0.9916,2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This is the best Marvel movie yet! Even if you're not a superhero fan, I still highly recommend this, because it doesn't feel like a superhero movie. Much like ""Winter Soldier"" it's more of a political thriller. It makes you think, and debate about accountability and other important issues, which is very unusual for a superhero film. It's not just mindless action. The action sequences, by the way, are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, Marvel or otherwise. They're choreographed so well. There's a lot that goes on, yet you never feel lost or overwhelmed during them. Up until this point, Andrew Garfield was my favorite actor to portray Spider-Man. Move over, Andrew Garfield. Newcomer Tom Holland has taken your spot. I was a bit skeptical when he showed up in the trailers because I thought he sounded way too young. But when he started throwing around one-liners in true Spider-Man fashion, all that doubt instantly went away. Fun fact: Tom Holland starred alongside Chris Hemsworth in ""In The Heart of the Sea,"" and it's because of Hemsworth's recommendation of Holland for the role of Spider-Man to Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios that Holland was cast in the role. Great choice, Chris Hemsworth! I'm excited to see what this young man has in store for the future. This was everything I wanted, and more. Every time I think ""Marvel can't possibly top this,"" they prove me wrong. But that's my worry. I'm worried that every Marvel film will try to outdo the predecessors by being bigger and better every time, until the MCU is eventually crushed by its own unattainable expectations. But until that day, I'll enjoy what the MCU has to offer. I expect great things from the next one: Doctor Strange. Great things, indeed. #TEAMCAP

" It's ENTERTAINMENT allright. And it's good at that. Any bad? Yes, it lasts way too long and the storyline is disjointed. BUT it's still quite enjoyable...
",0.2884,0.9969,2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"It's blockbuster entertainment. And it sells well, because it IS ENTERTAINING. And entertaining is all it needs to be.Any bad? Well, there are many storylines and many characters, which result in a somewhat disjointed, chaotic storyline. Could have been better with a more tight knit storyline and fewer characters. Drama and suspense ENHANCES for me when the story is straight forward and simple. The action is simple and straight forward though, but the story unfortunately is not. This story lasts too long as well, 2 and a half hour is simply TOO much for an action movie, in my humble opinion.The good: it;s FUN. it's mindless, good fun. But it also has something few other action blockbuster have: it has great dialogues AND it has great actors. I didnt expect such great dialogues in an action blockbuster. And I am quite PLEASED with that.This movie can be watched by adults as well. Even those adults who usually dont go see such action blockbusters. It isnt special or a must see, but you wont get annoyed or bored either, because (as I have said before), the characters and the dialogues make this into a grown up AND entertaining action blockbuster."

" Civil War brings a deeper integration and development of each character, in addition to expanding the universe bringing new characters
",-0.5994,0.9939,2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Civil War is responsible for deepening and providing long-awaited answers and has an essential role in answering questions raised in previous films, in addition to setting the stage for the expansion of the universe for future films that promise to be nothing than epic.The Avengers are on a mission in Africa. Even if they avoid an attack of catastrophic proportions, civilians die. Secretary of State Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt resuming his role as ""The Incredible Hulk"", 2008) reports that 117 countries will sign a treaty that limits the team's activities. Tony Stark, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) understands that this restriction is necessary for tragedies to be avoided. Steve Rogers, Captain America (Chris Evans), believes in the individuality of the human being and sees in the treaty a form of manipulation. Meanwhile, another situation involving Winter Soldier / Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) contributes to the division of the Avengers.The film is, at the same time, a continuation of the proposed themes of ""Age of Ultron"", in addition to continuing the arc of the ""Winter Soldier"", and bringing together the best characteristics of both, bringing the epic action with a very well stitched and with a political background that exposes various ethical and moral issues of our society amid characters with fantastic powers. Set after the events of ""Age of Ultron"", screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely adapt the arc of the ""Civil War"" comics by Mark Millar and Steven McNiven with extreme category, establishing the feud between Captain America and the Man of Iron when the Sokovia Treaty is placed under the table, signed by more than a hundred countries that aims to regulate and limit the jurisdiction of the Avengers who are acting by ignoring the limits of sovereignty, with unlimited power and without supervision, causing destruction and deaths caused as a result of previous clashes in New York (The Avengers), Washington (The Winter Soldier), Sokovia (Age of Ultron), Lagos (beginning of Civil War).The plot makes a point of not pointing out who is right or wrong. Tony Stark is haunted by the guilt of past actions, while Rogers is concerned with protecting his battlemates and that the heroes' anonymity is key to their risky missions. The other characters naturally align themselves to one side or the other in an organic way and showing the whole context of their decisions, which generates a split between the heroes. Each fights for the ideals he believes.Marvel still takes advantage of ""Civil War"" to bring back old acquaintances and introduce some new characters long awaited by fans. The Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) is the catalyst character and moves all the actions of the feature. We can finally see what happened to him after the end of ""Winter Soldier"" and how he is used as a play to trigger ""Civil War"" events. In addition, we have the introduction of T'Challa, the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). In a few scenes we are already presented to the political side of the hero and, soon after, to the warrior side of the protector of Wakanda. From his first scene in Vienna with his father, even when he appears already dressed as the Black Panther, starring in crazy scenes of chase through the buildings, tunnels and streets of the city alongside the Captain and the Winter Soldier, they already show a magnificent introduction to this character.We have back to Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision, who bond, Hawk (Jeremy Renner), Combat Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Agent Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), and a comeback that will blow the head of fans of comics and films: Spider-Man. As a result of a highly publicized agreement between Sony and Marvel, the hero returns ""borrowed"" to the studio of the House of Ideas, Peter Parker is recruited by Tony Stark to fight alongside the Captain and his allies, Spider-Man reappears being younger than previously shown in theaters, as well as Aunt May. Living with his powers for about six months and still learning to deal with them, but already knowing that this meant new responsibilities in wanting to help people, he gets a "" upgrade ""in his still precarious Tony Stark uniform, in addition to satisfying all fans in the airport scenes with his acrobatics, agility and humor. Actor Tom Holland is extremely comfortable playing the most famous arachnid in comics. In his few scenes in the film, his mentor / apprentice relationship with Tony Stark is incredible. These scenes are the highlight of the comic relief of the story.The script by Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely is decided to put different facets both in this agreement and in the people involved in it. General Ross (William Hurt) is known to the public, for ""Incredible Hulk"", and, therefore, famous for not being a very pleasant person or even just. When referring to the Emerald Giant and Thor, Ross compares them to atomic bombs, not people or superheroes, but weapons of giant destructive power. The Russo Brothers want their Civil War to embrace international issues and not merely within the realm of superheroes born and active within the United States.In addition to this fight between responsibility and supervision, there is a more central theme in the film: revenge. Baron Zemo is a complicated character, since his true motivations are hidden until the final minutes, but I was very happy to see that his goal was simply to screw with the Avengers, because they caused the death of people he loves - and not conquer the world or make an army of super soldiers. It is still a little forced, but he did not care to die or be arrested, he was completely overwhelmed by the desire for revenge. The same is true for Tony after he discovers something we have known since Winter Soldier: Bucky was responsible for killing his parents (remember when HIDRA shows the agent's targets, and we see Nick Fury and Howard Stark among the dead?). That desire also grips T'challa after his father is killed at the UN. But when the Black Panther sees what the villain's central purpose was, he understands where he had fallen. Maybe the way Wakanda has behaved needs to change, maybe he needs to change.Something interesting is to note that the Avengers union usually happens just to see them fighting as a team or exchanging jokes with each other. And this is not necessarily a bad thing, on the contrary, but eventually you start to expect ""something more"". After all, nobody likes a magician who only has one trick. Civil War is that ""something more. ""It's a film that is only possible because we know Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton and Bucky Barnes. We have seen how they have changed over the years, we know their motivations and weaknesses, and watching them fight goes beyond ""heroes vs heroes"" is fun.Action scenes in different locations on the planet. In addition to the United States, the plot takes place in Vienna, Budapest, Nigeria, London and Berlin for example. The entire opening sequence in Lagos in the persuasion against the Crossbones (Frank Grillo) - which triggers the questions of the governors around the world - is simply breathtaking, as well as the attack in Vienna, the persecution of the Winter Soldier in Bucharest, the fifteen uninterrupted minutes of action scenes at the airport involving more than a dozen heroes and, of course, the final climax involving Iron Man, Captain America and the Winter Soldier involving a major revelation of the past. The Russo brothers repeat here what they had already done in ""The Winter Soldier"", creating extremely realistic and impactful scenes, using camera movements and frames that put you inside the action. Combined with the incredible visual effects and photography by Trent Opaloch and the soundtrack by Henry Jackman, make ""Civil War"" a unique experience. In all these action scenes, however much they involve several characters, they are extremely cohesive, well directed and which gives everyone space to shine.The impression for the vast majority of people is that ""Civil War"" is an Avengers story before it's a Captain's story, and although they're not wrong, this is a story led by the Captain, an arc that focuses more on him than in others. ""Civil War"" has some problems. Characters like the Combat Machine, Hawkeye and Ant-Man are just there for the action to get more interesting, and Zemo's motivations are extremely expected - one more person who lost his family and blames the heroes - but this is by far the film that leaves more consequences for the universe, that brings more weight and importance to itself, and for that reason it is perhaps the best of Marvel so far. It is the real closing of Phase 2, and more important than deaths or twists, we have a breach of trust and friendship. Yes, the world is hunting heroes now, but more than that, the Avengers, as we know them, are over. From now on, it will be fascinating to see some developments of the consequences of the acts presented here. We will see Tony reacting to the fact that he is wrong, something he does by not following Colonel Ross's orders. Wanda and Visão were clearly moving towards something more intimate, but there was a tremendous breach of trust between them, and the android ends up questioning his reason. And Black Panther now decides to implement a different philosophy in his country, abandoning the path of revenge and going against the world by hiding the Avengers there.""Civil War"" is yet another hit by the Russo brothers in Marvel's multi-million dollar franchise, bringing action, adventure, humor, drama and lots of fun in a lean script, with excellent dialogue and twists that leave everything just right to please the audience . It is, so far, the best Marvel film, which brings a deeper integration and development of each character, in addition to expanding the universe bringing new characters that will have fundamental importance."
" Heroes fighting heroes
",0.6249,-0.8256,2020-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Civil War is basically Avengers 2.5 and Marvel throw everything at the film. Interestingly, this film never hit the heights of the previous Avengers film, just odd when you consider everyone involved. The Marvel films at this stage were very connected and started growing towards Infinity Wars. This at the very core is a Captain America film, and a continuation of the first two films. I've never cared for heroes fighting one another, but Captain beating Iron Man is icing on a cake though."

" Since when does a superhero flick have a better third act than first? Since Civil War.
",-0.25,0.9965,2020-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Part post-Watergate thriller, part post-Bourne globetrotting actioner. Slick dialogue, sick action, some smart retconning and remodelling and a smattering of excellent ideas. The concentrated, focused tone and influences and the cleverly designed superhero moments make for a memorable and nail-biting superflick.Remember that first time you saw a Marvel movie and you loved it. That very special Marvel movie that you came out of the cinema thinking: ""THAT'S what these connected, colourful, gripping, comic properties should be, full of in-jokes and great surprises and genuine humour.""
Civil War wipes the floor with that.
Fully succeeds at making a Cap centric story that has some amazing character introductions, exchanges, and is focussed on paying off so many threads from previous Marvel films in a way Ultron wishes it could.
It appeases the adult in me by providing rich dialogue, completely balanced non-archetypal politics, and stunning modern action sequences, each one with three or four gags at least that makes smart individual use of the characters skills involved.
Cap's third instalment simultaneously managed to also appeal to the child in me by providing many, surprising, earned comic book moments full of wonder and integrated very organically and very differently to the crap that was Ultron.
I genuinely cheered, and exclaimed in wonder, or surprise or shock. And that's a testament to the skill, nerdy smarts and talents of the Russos and their team. Making Cap a sympathetic, emotional, very un-American hero.
Yes, you do have to have seen the other MCU properties to appreciate this movie. But even without all the comic bookiness, it succeeds as a taught 'family' thriller, brothers versus brothers. Genuine globetrotting (nice use of location cards) thrilling, clever, riveting, twisty movie that takes Winter Soldier, throws everything bad about it out, tosses in everything that made Iron Man great and closes off so many threads in a sensitive, spiralling, ingenious way that you can't help but go along for the ride and come out grinning.
I won't whisper in your ear about how great it is (the way you could palpably hear a ripple of boyfriends in the cinema explaining who this or that is in the MCU when they appeared!) But instead I will shout from the rooftops how great this movie is - because if the MCU is more like this, then it isn't a colossal, cheeky, cashgrab, it can sometimes meet the lofty heights of an affective, reflective, relevant piece of art."

",-0.7003,-0.9662,2019-12-19 00:00:00,6,"No spoilers:From a scene in the first fifteen minutes of the movie:
Few movies have made me hateful. However the blaming of a character for the death of ten people when that very action saved a hundred people...w...t....F! Not to mention the complete disregard for the fact that the character had not intended for anyone to die at all......Sooo much in the movie revolves around this event ...and so...just...grrrrrr.I have loved almost every MCU movie. Civil War and Age of Ultron are two blemishes on the stretch of great movies for me though. I liked all three Thors, all of Cap's, both of GOTG, both Ant-mans, all of the Spider-mans including Far From Home, and I even enjoyed all of the Iron Mans. I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.I detested the dumbing down of the governments. You see this in lots of hollywood movies. At least in Transformers Bumblebee the dumbing down was done in a humorous manner that sort of made fun of itself. This one just treated people who work in the gov't like selfish corrupt idiots.I saw this way back when it was in theaters. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie. For the plot itself to be compromised...dang it really bummed me out. I do advise watching it if you are going to watch Infinity War or Endgame. There are some good things in these Ultron and Civil War that I am glad I didn't miss out on."

But ends quite strong, whereas BvS (had to) starts strong and finish not quite as you would have wanted it to be.I thought Cap's motivation shouldn't really be focused too much on Bucky, but instead on the accords. It kinda makes him a bit uncharacteristic. I thought that they had heavy themes to play with, but the fact that they just gloss over makes it somewhat anti-climactic. As Vision' said ""Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.""The fights are also pretty tame and harmless, I'd say. I thought they didn't really wanna fight, or as Scarlet Witch said they were ""pulling their punches"". So, its' hard to take them seriously. Whereas, BvS looked more convincing on their fight scenes. And Superman did die (although that would just be a stepping stone and wasn't really done right, and I do have issues with it, let's not talk about that) You could say you would expect nobody to die. And it was. Nobody dies.Although, I really liked anything involving Spider-Man (I am a big Spider-Man fan, after all). Except the CGI. Looks a bit too most of the time. Doesn't look as good as Andrew Garfield's CGI Spider-Man. And Baron Zemo is quite good. I'd say it's the best Marvel cinematic villain to date. Isn't powerful, but manage to split them apart. More villains like these please.Overall, a good movie. Sure, I thought they should focus more on certain issues rather than make this movie too much a ""Save Bucky"" movie, that they play it too safe. But hey, it is a Marvel movie. It's good, but not good enough. Even if they're bad, they're not Batman & Robin bad. I would like to see future Marvel movies change this perception of mine. But as it is, it's a standard Marvel movie."
" Anthoer Brilliant MCU movie from Marvel as the character's deepen even more and the universe expands
",0.7906,0.9912,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Civil War is my second favourite Captain America movie in the MCU behind The Winter Soldier and is a more than entertaining action film to boot with some very crisply shot action sequences as the action filmmaking in this legendary film series just keeps on getting better and better and more sharply shot with every installment that comes out in this franchise. The Avengers are split down the middle when they realise every single time they save the world from total cataclysm and disaster, a few people die in the process, when Tony decides he need government control over the Avenger's Initative, Steve disagrees and says that they should still be free to do whatever they please, causing a tense rift dividing the Avengers into two conveniently divided faction set against one another (how convenient)Despite it's serious and political undertones which obviously was reflecting the Trump vs Hillary election of 2016 and the pure craziness and hilarity that unfolded leading up to the historic and fateful triumph of Trump over the US once again dividing American society even more than it needed to be where everyone is forced to ""pick a side"" and fight against the opposing force. The film is still also very funny and hasn't lost it's recognisable humor that MCU fans love. Full of banter between the characters and quips and jokes dropped at a steady pace. You will be laughing aswell as getting deeper invested into the story and the darker tones the film dives into toward the end revealing more about the characters pasts and backstoriesThe CGI and special effects are once again spot on in the film, especially with Iron Man's suit which look better than it ever has before. The introduction of Tom Holland as Spider-Man was also nailed perfectly and the scenes he appeared in were all excellent and entertaining, setting the tone for the future MCU Spider-Man films to come.This was a very satisfying MCU film with great direction and sharply crafted action scenes and a deep and complex story.

The governments of the world appreciate the fact that the world isn't being run by Loki, but they feel like a line needs to be drawn and the Avengers need to be reined in. Some Avengers agree, and others do not. This provides the political reason for the split within the Avengers, but the movie doesn't turn it personal early enough, in my opinion. An esoteric fight about the relative limits on Avengers power is a great place to start the conflict of the film, but it hangs on that for too long before it gives us the gut punch change that turns the conflict personal and what drives the final twenty minutes of the film.The Winter Soldier is still on the loose after the events in The Winter Soldier, and it looks like he's bombed a UN complex in Vienna when the Sokovia Accords are being signed that will limit the Avengers' authority. This explosion also kills the King of Wakanda, who is there to sign the Accords. A chase ensues after Cap gets a heads up on where Bucky, the Winter Soldier, is, and he helps him escape temporarily until they end up captured and arrested. It is here that Zemo, the actual antagonist of the film, inserts himself, setting off an EMP that kills power in Berlin and gives the secret command codes to Bucky that turns him into the Winter Soldier. Cap gets Bucky away and finds out where Zemo is going next. In order to get to Siberia, Cap and Bucky need to get an aircraft.It is at the airport that the big battle between the heroes breaks out. It's big, inventive, fun, and ultimately pretty pointless (the physical stakes in these movies have gotten laughably low), leading Cap Bucky to getting an airplane, chased by Iron Man and the Black Panther. In Siberia, two hours into the movie, we finally learn Zemo's plan and have the movie move from an political argument to a personal one. Zemo wants to tear apart the Avengers from the inside, knowing he's not physically strong enough to take them on, so he uses the truth that Bucky, as the Winter Soldier, killed Tony Stark's parents to splinter them completely. It's such a great and brutal fight between three people in an enclosed space.Ultimately, as I said earlier, I wanted to love this movie. It's got strong themes of liberty versus regulation that echo through so much of what's going on. It eventually distills that beginning intellectual conflict into a personal one between two heroes we've grown attached to over the years. It looks really good and the action is better filmed than it was in The Winter Soldier. However, the big airport fight, while fun, is pretty pointless. We do get one injury, but that's it, keeping the stakes of these fights really low. There are too many characters that have their moments that don't feed into the larger narrative (Spider-Man being the most egregious example). And Zemo is underdeveloped. I love the idea of Zemo, but the execution is so relegated to the back end of the film that it ends up losing its impact.I'd love to see this movie with a smaller cast that allows for greater focus on the central conflict between Stark and Rogers. I'd love for Zemo to have a strong narrative presence early, and I'd love for the information on Bucky's involvement with Tony's parent's death to come out earlier and define Tony's motives well before the final act. I can imagine scenes where people confront Tony with his opposition ' to Rogers's side because he's driven by revenge, and he needs to balance his ideals with his personal emotions before ultimately giving in to his emotional side.Still, there's so much that's so good here. It has some of the same issues as Age of Ultron, but it does a better job of holding it all together. It also feels like it gets closer to something special, even if it still falls short. It coulda been great."

" A fantastic installment to the saga!
",0.5983,0.9254,2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,"When Civil War first came out the highlight for most fans was Spider-Man's first appearance in the MCU. But looking back at it, while Tom Holland's portrayal of a young Spidey is close to perfection and it set up it's own movies (which I thoroughly enjoyed also), I found that the highlight of the film - for me - was Antman! I just found myself laughing out loud on 2-3 occassions in this movie and all of those were triggered by Antman. I liked how this movie further built on the rift between Cap and Tony but ultimately the movie did fail in explaining how on earth an apparant civilian could so easily figure out Hydra's secrets in his attempt to frame Bucky and therefore ""cause them (The Avengers) to kill eachother"". Bucky was supposedly anonymous and unfindable for 50-years and this seemingly random guy figured it all out in a few months?"

The government is mad at the Avengers because of property damage, even though most of that was caused by the bad guys. And the trouble in D.C. was actually *their* fault. Even the action isn't that good because there's no tension. You know they're not gonna kill each other. Some good acting though, especially from Chadwick Bosman. He's way better here than in Black Panther. There's also a certain character that appears and that made me happy. Other than that, Civil War just isn't that great.Overall, a 6.5/10 (Okay)"

For a civil war it was really puny compared to the comics.There is not much Civil War going on In m opinion.

Captain America and iron man had been in a good amount of films and had dealt with their hardships. So when this movie came along there decisions have a purpose. This movie has some qualities that I wish more movies had. It has really good dialogue. Characters sit down and talk and it just feels organic than usual. It's mostly because of the energy the Captain America movies have. This movie makes these characters feel real and that's awesome because it gives the universe a nice change of pace. There are other great stuff. Great acting. Great script. Has some of the best action. If I could think of any issues I would say the music. I don't like how marvel changes the score of the films, people made videos of that. I also really don't like the shaky cam it's a headache. The villains plan is also pretty dumb and complicated. But these problems aren't too bad so I can let go of them. This is the movie that made me a marvel fan so I have a huge attachment for it."
" Overlong and far too busy
",0.0,-0.409,2019-08-25 00:00:00,5,"With a government agency putting restrictions on their actions The Avengers find themselves dividing into two teams. Team Captain America who go against what the agency say and continue as vigilantes and Team Iron Man whom work with the agency to uphold the law. However, a major political incident involving their old nemesis The Winter Soldier causes further strain amongst The Avengers. However, things aren't quite what they seem and a larger conspiracy soon begins to unravel...As a franchise, Captain America has been far from perfect and not one of the three films has blown me away, but in my humble opinion I found this third film the weakest of the three...The first thing that I need to address with this film is the length of it; it's simply TOO long and for what reason?? So that Marvel can introduce every single character in its entire existence. It actually got to the point where it started to become tedious when yet another character was introduced. What made it worse is that some characters appeared out of nowhere with no explanation as to who contacted them? Ant-Man just arrived in a van with no build-up and I'm pretty sure that Clint seemed to turn up out of nowhere as well. Iron Man at one point is unnerved by these 5 hydra agents hiding out in Russia and says he knows just the person who can help them and then gets Spider-man?? Don't get me wrong I like Spider-man as a super-hero, but how is he any more of a credible adversary than any of the other Avengers? At least in Justice League it made sense that they wanted Superman on-board as he's clearly much stronger than the other DC characters. It wouldn't have been so bad if the many introductions, political differences, squabbling and showdowns would have had much point, but the 5 Hydra Agents that are threatening the world don't even show up which in the end made the film something of a frustrating viewing experience.The film does have some good points; for a start I did like the idea of The Avengers dividing into 2 teams; sort of bureaucrats vs vigilantes which kind of gives it a conflict within a conflict scenario. There are enough fight sequences scattered throughout the film to not make the unbearably long running time not be as much of a problem as it could have been.Still despite this I couldn't warm to this third instalment in the franchise as much as I would have liked to; it just felt cluttered, unfocused and a little too busy for my liking. Perhaps being the third film in the franchise influenced the producers/writers decision to introduce the endless number of characters, but for me I found that this merely engulfed the film and didn't really allow the story to breathe. As it stands it's a passable effort, but for me its the weakest film in the trilogy."
" A Thrilling and Thought Provoking Action-Adventure
",0.3182,0.2859,2019-08-25 00:00:00,9,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a thrilling and thought provoking comic book movie with an engaging story, complex characters, and fantastic action sequences that are among the best in the MCU. After having hinted at the rivalry between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark in the previous ""Avengers"" films, ""Civil War"" brings their conflict to fruition in a movie that makes both sides sympathetic by showing the best and worst of both heroes. The set-up is brilliant: in the aftermath of ""Age of Ultron"" the world believes that the Avengers need oversight and Tony Stark leads the charge in favor of the new Sokovia Accords. Steve Rogers and his allies, suspicious of government oversight, defy the new agreement and therefore international law - setting up a clash between two of America's most popular icons.The dynamic between Stark and Rogers is the highlight of the movie: it's the egocentric billionaire who defies expectations and becomes the vanguard of the ""collective good,"" while the righteous war hero emerges as the enemy of greater government control and even - in this case - the popular will. As always, Robert Downey Jr. shines as Iron Man - to the extent that his personality overshadows Captain America, whose name is in the title. Additionally, Chadwick Boseman gives a stand-out performance as Black Panther, who steals the show in many of his scenes.It goes without saying that the now-famous action sequences in ""Civil War"" are fantastic: from the initial confrontation in Lagos to the clash at the Berlin airport the fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and endlessly entertaining. But at heart, what makes these scenes work is the rich characters who are at both times flawed and immensely likable. Much as the movie itself is as a matter of fact: like many Marvel movies the main villain is weak and far less essential to the story than the protagonists. We didn't need the mysterious Zemo and his messy scheme to split up the Avengers - that was the whole point of the Sokovia Accords. His story adds little to the film and instead drags out the running time to an excessive 2 hours and 27 minutes.There's also a sense of contrivance that hurts the integrity of the story: why couldn't Rogers at least try to sit down with Stark to come to some sort of compromise? To be so stubborn seems out of character for Rogers, who in previous films had played the role of a team leader and mediator. And why, after all the death and destruction that Barnes had wrought, couldn't Rogers demonstrate at least some empathy for his victims - one of whom was his friend Howard Stark? It's one thing to see the good in people, it's another to totally overlook their failings at the expense of your teammates. You get the sense that these choices weren't made because it was best for Rogers' development as a character, and instead they were made because the filmmakers used whatever excuse they could to get Captain America and Iron Man to fight each other.""Captain America: Civil War"" isn't a perfect movie. But nonetheless it's a powerful action adventure with stunning visuals, top notch performances, and an engrossing story that continues to be as gripping as ever even with multiple viewings. 9/10."
" BRILLIANT!!! A TOUGH LOOK AT HERO CONFLICT.
",0.7562,0.9932,2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"WOW!!! Civil War is absolutely Brilliant, the darker more serious tone of the excellent Winter Soldier has carried over to this fantastic film.The action scenes & fight scenes are absolutely fantastic in Civil War, especially the frantic & exciting gritty opening action packed scene with Cross Bones & his terrorist team, it's outstanding.A big cast of great actors & characters mixed into a political nightmare that's handled perfectly with a gritty & dark tone & dangerous Atmosphere.
Steve Rogers is again fantastic as the troubled Captain America who is torn between what's right & wrong & friends & enemies & loyalties are broken, Civil War is a mature super hero movie.
Just like the equally excellent Winter Soldier, this Civil War is handled with a sense of real grit & harsher so these characters feel like they exist in the real complicated world.Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is a fantastic actor & brings heart & soul to his character, Panther steals the show alot when he's on screen.
There's so many Awesome characters here such as Spiderman, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow & more great stars of the Marvel universe but it's the interesting & intense relationship between Steve Rogers & Tony Stark that is at the heart of this serious sci-fi Thriller.
Captain America vs Iron man.
The winter soldier himself Bucky is has a bigger & more tragic story here, he has been mind controlled for years & now has to deal with the torment of his past actions & the complete loneliness he feels as an outsider who is good at heart & best friends with childhood pal Steve Rogers but has been a deadly Assassin for so long he mind is a mess, IT'S a really well told little story arc for the character & he becomes one of the best characters in the movie.Chris Evans is absolutely excellent in his iconic role as Steve Rogers/Cap & he's my reason for getting into these films of the Marvel universe, Captain is such a great Troubled character to follow on his adventures as he's a loner really, a lost man from a completely different world & he's always trying to find his porpoise & his meaning in this new messed up terrorist & corruption filled world.Although this is a big budget Superhero film it's all handled like a deep serious Thriller just like The winter soldier & that's because of the excellent directors the Russo bros they know how to work a fantasy story & mixed it into a real grittier environment.Captain America:Civil War is One of the greatest Marvel movies of all tine"
" Marvel - the Quest for Cash
",0.4215,-0.9864,2019-08-15 00:00:00,1,"Sorry Marvel fans but this is 100% no more than a money maker!I watched this when it was first released but apparently I was so unimpressed that I forgot about it completely! Now, having made the mistake of watching it again I feel the need to make the statement: it is just awful! There is no real story, just the 'convoluted regurgitated, how can we modify this to make this marginally sensible' sort of approach. The acting is cardboard, frankly I wish someone would melt Ironman down and make a nice saucepan out of him, then take Steve Rogers and shove the shield up his.. enough, yes, I was deeply, deeply disappointed with this movie.The ONLY saving grace for this was as always, the special effects. Ironically because I was so disappointed with the movie I found myself trying to figure out just how much acting the actors actually do? I believe that 75% of all character scenes are actually CGI, therefore, these 'actors' (cardboard) are getting paid heaps of money for doing less and less! Of course that thought process probably didn't help with my overall opinion of the movie!I will mention that part of the reason I watched this again was because I lost the link for Infinity Wars and Endgame, so I needed to review this to refresh my memory, sadly! I say sadly because I think Infinity Wars should be called ""Marvel the Quest for even more cash' and Endgame; 'Marvel the we want all the cash you have left from our previous mugging sessions'.I wasn't a comic book kid so perhaps I shouldn't have even watched these movies, believe me, I wish I hadn't because they are long and I could have been doing something that created memories worth having in the time I wasted on these really awful, pointless and terribly acted excursions into nothingness.One final comment; Benedict, please leave this clan of losers before you, whom are probably THE only actor worthy of a future from these terrible movies, become labeled as a 'comic book' character and lose ALL credibility as a real actor.Comic book fans; you'll probably love this drivel."

The airport battle is in like top 5 MCU fight scenes along with the final battle in Siberia between Cap, Bucky, and Iron man.

this movie has three of my all time favorite action sequences: the apartment escape/street running, the airport scene, and the final battle. all jaw-dropping. and a bunch of other awesome sequences in betweenand what a great completely unexpected twist-ish reveal at the end with tony's parents. such a great moment, an ""omg it's about to go down"" momentI really liked how the movie went in directions that I wasn't expecting. After the big battle I thought they were going to make up and be friends again to team up against the other 5 Winter Soldiers. But the bad guy's plan was way better. Restarted the Civil War, and had the movie end with them still at odds, setting up future movie conflicts and resolutionsWhile I was watching it I was wondering who would be on which side, and the only ones I thought I knew were Iron Man and Captain America, but they ended up being on the opposite side of what I expected. But they both made perfect sense. Captain America went through the same stuff with Hydra and SHIELD. It makes sense that he doesn't trust bureaucrats and politicians to make decisions. And Iron Man's side makes sense given past movies and how he feels guilty and responsible for so much. It may not have been addressed a lot in this movie but it has been in previous movies.So many good characters, and I don't just mean awesome superheroes. I mean the actual characters, and their development and arcs.I really liked everything about the introduction of Spider-Man including the actor. I am now super excited to see the new movie. And it was reaffirmed to me that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero because I was so ecstatic to see him, even over all these other awesome superheroes i love. would have been amazing if I didn't know he was in it. But I didn't know about anyone other than Cap, Iron Man, Spider-Man. I was guessing it would have Falcon and War Machine, I didn't know it had everyone else, especially Black Panther and Ant-Man. Black panther is bad-ass and Ant-Man was hilarious."

I mean, all the Avengers are here (except for Hulk and Thor) and it follows on 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'. After all, the first two Captain America films only featured Captain America as super-hero.Ok, so this film was about...uhm...well... about.... what the heck was it about again?? Apart from the Avengers fighting among themselves there really wasn't much else going on in this film! (Hence the title Civil War, off course.) The fact that the film earned more than $1 billion dollars is completely beyond me. So, the audience actually enjoy seeing the Avengers fighting among themselves??? What a weird society we live in...Let's face it, the opening scene was very good, and the Bucky chase scene was absolutely incredible. It was fast-paced, exciting and the great photography made the viewer feel he was actually part of the action. After that the film mainly revolves around conflict between the Avengers. I actually enjoyed Tony Stark in this film, who was the most sensible character. The film was dramatic until the halfway mark when Spider-Man and Ant-Man showed up, and along came the silly humor that didn't belong. Why were they in the film at all? They only had a few minutes screen time each and could easily have been replaced by some of the other characters. There were absolutely no need for them.The fight scene at the airport was completely over the top and actually became rather silly, almost amateurish. It felt like I was watching a visualization of a child's imagination whilst playing with his toys. It honestly was cringe worthy.There really was no need for this film..."

1. once again Downey Jr puts in a stellar performance as Iron Man who is fast becoming a cult hero for me
2. The introduction of the black panther is interesting as he seems like a cool character, hopefully the stand alone movie will be better than this oneApart from those two reasons, I won't be scurrying to watch this again anytime soon

" A great follow up
",0.6249,0.6026,2019-05-21 00:00:00,8,I thought this was a good movie though I think it should've been an Avengers movie instead of a Captain America movie as it focuses on all of them. The story's about the Avengers being ethically divided over a set of laws set to go into place that'll regulate how superheroes to their jobs.They're known as the Sokovia Accords and they were created after a mission to stop Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones (Frank Grillo) from stealing a biological weapon from Lagos goes awry when he attempts to detonate himself Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) attempts to contain the blast and direct it somewhere else but instead directs it towards a building which kills several people. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) supports it but Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) doesn't and decides to go rouge leading to a divide in the team.Unbeknownst to them someone is pulling the strings and it's a mysterious terrorist named Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl). He frames Bucky Barnes(Sebastian Stan) for the assassination of the Wakandan king T'Chaka leading to his son T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) to vow vengeance. Things pretty much fall apart between the group leading to an awesome fight scene.What I like about this movie is the story and execution. What's interesting is how the motives all make sense and are believable even if you don't agree with them. This makes the tension and fight scenes better grounded. I won't give away the ending but I will day I was hoping it would end in more of a high note. This's an enjoyable film and I highly recommend checking it out.

This film adds the stakes Marvel has been struggling with, and it does it with a nuanced but compelling villain. It adds fantastic characters like Black Panther. It takes Tony Stark and Steve Rogers' characters to new heights by bringing them to new lows. It manages to utilize dozens of characters and still does them all justice. It brings up interesting moral dilemmas and political questions. The action is also fantastic in this movie with several cinematic fight scenes being better than in the previous Avengers, but also close-quarters duels that sport excellent choreography and weight in the emotions behind them. This is a near flawless film and perhaps the best film Marvel has released. After seeing Endgame, I must say Civil War's consequences still feel relevant and it remains one of my personal favorite superhero films."
" Decent
",0.0,0.9102,2019-05-11 00:00:00,7,The movie doesn't do anything great or blow my mind or anything but it had solid action and solid acting. The scene where's there's Captain America and 5 heroes fighting against Iron Man and the other 5 was pretty good action. Not sure why they always have to try and throw comedy into the fights but whatever that's the MCU formula. I like it when Paul Rudd does it but a lot of the others don't land.

" Hindsight is 20/20 but this film makes me feel like I need a bath.
",0.5023,0.9891,2019-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Late to the party on this but I believe this might offer some succinct critique in light of the newest phase of Marvel. I do not like Civil War aside from the great fight scene pitting the two factions of the Avengers off against each other. Why? The humor, setting, and endearment of the characters. This film is dark, ugly and leaves me scratching my head at the end wondering if I even like Captain America.... I certainly don't like Bucky, his death would have been more than appropriate and possibly redemptive.The Steve Rogers character arch is coming dangerously close to crossing the line and strains every bit of credulity I have for the morality of CA's character, which is supposed to be his defining quality. Should Captain America lie to the face of his friends as much and as petty and critically as he does? Would Captain America put even his closest friend above doing the right thing? Is mind control truly a valid excuse to justify all Bucky's horrific actions to have CA stand by him the entire film? He has murdered countless innocents in cold blood. How Steve can see him brutally kill the Stark family and stand by him against Tony's desire to avenge his parents is beyond me. I saw that as betrayal, that hurt to watch. I don't care what Steve and Bucky had before, he certainly isn't the same man before either of them went into the deep freeze. Rogers is supposed to be the moral center of the Avengers, the leader with the most exemplary qualities, without which he 240 pounds of genetically enhanced muscle and a shield, nothing more. Very disappointing. I empathized with Tony Stark 1000% more in this movie than the namesake, he comes out as the superior Avenger in all aspects or at least the ones that count. I like CA or at least I wanted to.The tone needs more dynamic humor for brevity. Draws too heavily on Bourne series emulation with an utterly forgettable antagonist unworthy of even a SHIELD series subplot. Endgame was appropriately morose and leveled things off with wonderful humor and just beautiful set pieces for the film to revolve around. Spider man and possibly Antman achieved this on some level in Civil War, but not enough! This hit too close to home and I ended this movie feeling like I needed a shower to wash the morbid choices from some of my favorite characters. It's unbelievable to think the Russo brothers made such a grand transition from this to Infinity War, I can't help but to think some key players are drastically understated in it's development.It's not a terrible movie and the action is well executed minus the final fight which is too dark and almost feels like the characters are duking it out in a sewer, which might be decidedly appropriate. The movie falls flat in most of the key plot points for me. The minor romance subplot feels hamfisted and tacked on, I didn't feel the chemistry or see that her motivations were adequate regardless of the history. It was cool to see a good portion of the Avengers, I like all of them in this and the entry of the Black Panther is cool. Although, I wish they would have done more with him, particularly at the end.My recommendation: Pass on this movie and just come away understanding Captain and Ironman had a little tiff. Your appreciation for the characters and the integrity of the MCU will be better for it in my humble opinion."
" One of the MCU's best, brilliant

Tension actually exists here, some fight scenes are intense, and the story is GREAT!The Bad: There's an annoying forced romance, a couple of action scenes had weak CG.Overall Captain America: Civil War is excellent, propelling the MCU in a direction it should of been going all along. Thumbs up!"
" Civil War = Perhaps Marvel's single Best with Amazing character introductions + Epic kinetic action & Suspense!
",0.6588,0.9972,2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"""Captain America: Civil War"" (circa 5/2016) does not disappoint in the least, presenting a believable philosophical conflict between competing leadership of the 'Avengers' i.e. Tony Stark espousing the power of technology + Logic + ordered-organizational imperative versus Steve 'Cap-America' Rogers' undying faith in individual-initiative + trust in gut-instincts + power of personal-Loyalty. The uncanny writer/directors (Russo Bros.) and entire cast of inspired-thespians involved with 'Cap-America: Civil War' present compelling arguments for competing-philosophies laying the foundation for authentic drama, immense action, and even intense though-provocation!Both Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans push their respective characters Tony Stark and Steve Rogers to the emotional-dramatic stratosphere in this one, with nearly every scene exhibiting inner (and outer) turmoil as they wrestle with their personal convictions and age-old human dilemma of distinguishing clearly between 'right & wrong' (and the lingering twin-demons of unintended-consequences and human 'collateral' damage)What really put this movie over-the-Top in terms of captivating characters and edge-of-you-seat thrilling action-drama are the introduction (and re-introduction) of two of MARVEL-Comics' absolute-Coolest most intriguing (and even entertaining) Characters: (1) T'CHalla the 'Black-Panther' and (2) your friendly-neighborhood-teenage 'Spider-Man'!I remember thinking back (when collecting those hallowed 'Marvels' as a kid) that the 'Black Panther' was perhaps the absolute Coolest character in the MARVEL Universe being benevolent leader of Wakanda (and producer of indestructible-metallic Vibranium), possessing technological-genius on the Level of Tony Stark + fighting-skills on par with Captain America (plus a costume even Cooler/ more stealthy than the 'Dark-Knight's arguably!) = the Writer-directors got T'Challa ""Black Panther"" exactly right (which couldn't have been an easy task) and actor Chadwick Boseman has infused the Panther T'Challa with the perfect measure of nobility, intelligence, fighting-prowess-ferocity, and even deep spiritual-outlook = as good or perhaps even better than any true MARVEL comics-fan could have ever hoped for!And the re-introduction of the one and only Spider-Man! In a way this might be the first time that the originally-envisioned (by Stan Lee & Steve Ditko) 'friendly-neighborhood' Spider-Man was finally brought to the screen (the Sam Raimi/ Tobey McGuire version was outstanding, but more than a bit angst-ridden, even bordering on tormented at times).
Tom Holland genuinely conveys Peter Parker's inner 'amazement' as a teenager being totally 'blown-away' and literally carried-away by his new found extremely-heightened 'Super-spider-senses' and astonishing physical abilities = during the massive 'throw-down' at the Airport, Peter Parker can barely contain his enthusiasm and is nearly giddy each time he launches into a successful attack against renegade Avengers (constantly providing humorous 'commentary' barely containing his own amazement & excitement, the sheer enthusiasm is contagious)""Captain America: Civil War"" is a truly outstanding film in every respect/aspect, I haven't even mentioned Scarlett Johansson's charismatic return as the 'real' (take no prisoners) 'Black-Widow' (who seemed a bit uncharacteristically 'wimpy' in the 'Age of Ultron' outing), but is completely/ thankfully back in action!
I also found the 'Vision & Scarlett Witch' burgeoning 'connection' quite intriguing (comic fans probably anticipated this, but will need to wait and see what develops). Special kudos go-out to Paul Bettany for giving movie (and SciFi) fans a spiritual homage to eternal-Hero 'Spock' in the form of 'Vision'* (i.e. the Logician-supreme with a genuine-artificial 'heart')note: *I think original Marvel-Avengers comic book writer Roy Thomas was a huge fan of contemporary Sci-Fi along with possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of 1940s Timely comics (aka ancient-Marvel) which included a pre-WWII rendition of 'Vision' => upgrading to high-Tech 'AI' proportions circa 1968. Roy Thomas would also usher in cosmically-aware Captain Marvel (and Warlock) soon after - with ingenious Jim Starlin infinitely-expanding Story-arcs to Epic and truly cosmic-propositions (introducing Thanos & Gamora) a few years after that!"

" The biggest threat is yourself
",-0.5267,0.9915,2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is everything that Marvel should be. Let's start with the villain: Zemo. Phenomenal, he has a motive that makes sense, he is creative, uses his intelligence to fight the Avengers and not his strength, and is shown to us not through conflict but through small snippets of his plan throughout the film. The red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict. Breaking the Avengers apart is the perfect concept for Marvel, it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future. We learn about Bucky, learn about Tony's past, and we get a massive insight into Steve's morals. Steve has already been seen doing what's right and just even if it disobeys direct orders, but this time he does it not against the government, but against his best friends as well. This movie also provides an introduction to multiple characters that were previously either not yet seen in the MCU, or had just not yet been introduced to the other characters. Overall it really is the emotion and story and development of Tony, Steve, and Bucky that drive this film to be as good as it is."

It's also emotionally impactful and really meant something to me, which despite liking most MCU films, I can't say they did the same.Evans and Downey Jr. are at the top of their game here, whilst the addition of Boseman and Holland are also superb.Every action scene is thrilling, especially the encounter at the airport which was endlessly inventive and thrilling. That's not forgetting the final battle between Cap, Tony and Bucky which became exceedingly brutal.I'm not sure I could ask for much more from a film like this, and I absolutely love it."
" I could watch this all day.
",0.0,0.9907,2019-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Essentially a third 'Avengers' film, 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)' easily ranks amongst the very best of the 'MCU' primarily because it's so breathlessly entertaining and effortlessly character-focused, featuring an eclectic set of charismatic characters caught on two sides of a captivating moral dilemma that has no clear 'right' or 'wrong'. It has an almost pitch-perfect tone, being serious without being gloomy, dark without being dour and having lasting consequences (both for this film and for the 'cinematic universe' at large). Having both the protagonist and antagonist be 'heroes' is a ballsy move but it pays off remarkably well. It leads to a thematically-rich experience that's much more nuanced than, perhaps, is usual with the genre. On top of all that, the flick brilliantly balances being, essentially, both a direct sequel to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)' and 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)', tying together themes and character motivations from both to further the feeling that these past events have shaped pretty much every core player's perspective. Where they side on the central debate feels wholly cohesive with their character, which is kept firmly at the heart of the feature, and this leads to tangible motivations that constantly drive every single decision. This is what really makes all the action feel palpable, as well as the fantastic stunt-work and restrained CG-integration. Our heroes aren't fighting nameless thugs, they're fighting their friends and it hurts. Yet, everyone thinks they're doing the right thing. Because of this, the non-universe-ending stakes are all the more impactful. It's really remarkable. It's also really emotionally affecting, especially when the subversive climax rolls around. 9/10"

Definitely recommend to everybody who loves old and new superhero movies.

Let's start with the story, compared to the comics, this is a lot different. I kind of feel like the storyline was wasted in the film. There were no consequences to their actions, which makes it seem anticlimactic. But, this film is still one of the best entries in the MCU. I love the introductions to Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were some of the best parts of the film. The action is another great thing about this movie. All in all, an amazing movie, but the premise was kinda wasted."

Via placing a person such as Helmut Zemo in the action and only from his will to complete his promise it is fascinating how he manipulated the avengers into turning the one against the other to fulfill and accomplish his revenge for the scar they left in his life after leaving Sokovia.
The fight was great, didn't expect to see Scott Lang there, but his presence was very enjoyable. Also, loved to see more of Bucky's history be unveiled to us slowly throughout the course of the Cap movies. Hope there is a Captain America 4, but I doubt it will ever happen. I really enjoyed watching the film for a third time and it didn't bother me at all. The only sad part is that Tony and Cap are not in speaking terms at the end of the movie."

The cast is a dream. It was a great opportunity to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man (I'd forgotten what mad skills Spider-Man brought to the fight). A lot of dialogue for this script but the action scenes were a good balance. Even on rewatching, I give his movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}"
" Avengers 3 excluding Thor and hulk
",0.0,-0.9817,2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,"In 2016, DC and marvel came up with their superhero vs superhero film. First DC came with dawn of justice which failed both critically and commercially. So eyes went on captain america civil war whether it meets their expectations or not. Does it meet?Plus:
1. Conflict point:
The biggest plus point of civil war is the conflict point shown between Steve rogers and Tony stark which would leave you confused to take sides unless you are a fanboy. If you have seen previous MCU movies you will understand the motive of the characters. If you have seen winter soldier you will know that cap was in a situation where he couldn't trust anyone other than himself. His insecurity towards the government forces him not to sign the accords. And if you have seen age of ultron and iron man 3 you understand that tony is regretting for his hasty creation of ultron which lead to several casualties and damage. Also he is upset with his temporary breakup with pepper for whom he destroyed all his suits and wanted to settle down with her. I was like in a position of black widow who is though in Tony's side still shows a soft corner towards cap.
2. Robert Downey Jr:
Among performances it's rdj who once again shines as tony stark. In this you get to see an entirely different tony stark who is not humorous and reckless but practical and emotional. Despite not being the main lead, RDJ leaves a mark with his performance.
3. Villain zemo:
Zemo is an underrated villain where audience don't realize that without any superpowers or extraordinary human strength successfully rip apart the avengers.
4. Airport battle:
The airport battle between team cap and team iron man is the main highlight of civil war. The interaction and action choreography was kickass.
5. Direction:
Though Russo brothers direction is not racy like winter soldier, it successfully helps in building the tension.
6. Climax fight:
The climax fight of civil war is very emotional which makes you divided. On one hand you can feel the rage of tony and on the other hand you can feel the desperation of cap to protect his friend from his teammate and friend. The climax fight makes both cap and iron man fans emotional. When I was watching I felt like shouting 'STOP FIGHTING'Minus:
1. The color tone of the film is dull at times. It is greyish which does not really suit the film.
2. When black panther came to know zemo's intention why he didn't stop cap and tony from fighting?Verdict:
Captain america civil war is more an avengers film than a cap film. It gives you everything which bvs failed to give you. It has emotions, friendship, tension, politics and loads of action. A successful rehearsal for infinity war."

",0.6369,-0.6897,2019-03-08 00:00:00,9,"When it comes to sequels, I fell very few film franchises do their predecessors justice. In my opinion, a great sequel requires a simple formula: cause and effect. The ""cause"" should be in the form of the first (or in this case, previous) movie(s). Whatever happens before a sequel should drive the plot of the following movie. This is the ""effect."" While it wasn't nearly as good as this effort, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) followed the same formula. Cause: Superman destroying most of Metropolis in Man of Steel (2013). Effect: Batman and Lex Luthor wanting to hold Superman accountable. See? Simple as that.What perhaps makes Captain America: Civil War such a great film is the amount of ""cause"" that led to its ""effect."" The driving plot of this film was in direct response to the destruction and mayhem brought about by the Avengers trying to save the world. Because of this, the difference in opinions on how to cut back on the collateral damage splits the Avengers in to two factions. Practically every superhero fan will tell you that the best fights are the ones between allies, and this film certainly delivers on that premise.But Captain America: Civil War isn't just about having a great balance between cause and effect, it's about the deep struggles we find inside ourselves. In a film with no true villain, the struggles we find in each of the heroes are struggles we all have. Anger. Pride. Fear. These are just the main elements of the conflict inside everyone, brought about by realizations of weakness, helplessness, and loss. Each of the different characters is given ample time to reveal the reasons why they fight, without bogging the film down in unnecessary exposition. If anything, the pacing on this nearly 3-hour film is nothing short of brilliant. Plus, not only does the audience get to see a hero-on-hero free-for-all melee (with practically all the film's best comedic bits mixed in), but they get to experience a rematch where the raw emotions of the title characters are on display.Another expertly made piece in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that makes me excited for any follow-on films in ""Phase 3"", I give Captain America: Civil War 4.5 stars out of 5."

Here's a spoiler alert if you haven't seen this movie yet. If you despise and dislike Iron Man (aka) Tony Stark as much as I do, then watch this film. in the end Captain America beat that ass like a Pinata. All Iron Man could do is ask for his Daddy's shield back, after that ass beating, he needed something to hide that shame. Marvel has a huge problem in making movies, their writers come from mental institutes, it seem, all their scripts have the same flawed theme, beat up each other for two hours, and spend 15 minutes on the bad guys. And what's up with the Iron Man wannabe, what is he Tin Man, Tony Stark's alter ego, his very own YES MAN. His character is so useless, from the first Iron man movie to this one, the only thing we haven't seen him do is shine Stark's shoes.To explain the high (10) rating, I gave it because someone finally wiped that smug, condescending, egomaniacal, arrogant, attitude off his face, even for a short while.

Every superhero gives his best in this movie to proove his worth and specialty as a Marvel Comic character and that is why it is so special. Alone the fact that this movie doesn't need a real villain to be good prooves by point first hand. The Spider-Man apperance was beautiful and so perfectly timed that it feels more natural than any situation in which we've seen Peter.

I binge watch the first and second movie and they were okey, but this has been confirmed to be a reaction for Batman V Superman. The first half of this movie was boring and the pacing was slow. Why couldn´t they have ended this trilogy as planned instead of a reaction to BvS? Watch BvS UE instead. That feels like a natural continuation to MoS."

" Please read the comics

This could of been an even bigger movie deriving the culmination of mini series and other films just off this one movie. This movie was a hit but also a miss. Movie by itself without background info is a 7-8.
" Captain America is the best avenger.
",0.6369,0.9972,2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Captain America: Civil War marks the third instalment in the Captain America trilogy, and in my opinion is the best movie of the three. With Avengers Infinity War on the horizon, Marvel Studios made the great choice of tearing the avengers apart, before facing their greatest threat so far. Joe and Anthony Russo had the massive task of bringing together majority of the heroes within the MCU together as well as introducing two new superheroes, while also having to tell a coherent and compelling story that continues the path of Steve Rogers. This film is a success in so many ways, and has a weight to it that will impact the history of comic book movies forevermore.If I had to pick out my most favourite facet of this film, one which I find the most powerful, it's that the Russo brothers depict Captain America perfectly. We're shown that despite what the name 'Captain America' insights, he doesn't just stand for patriotism and the American way, but for freedom and the urge to do the right thing. He is integral to not only the MCU, but to everyday life itself, which I feel is something that many people can connect with and relate to.There is a huge amount of super people in this movie, more than had ever been on screen together in that time. This may sound overcrowding, though it definitely doesn't feel that way. The film is balanced when it comes to its characters, no one has too little or too much screen time, everyone is there for a reason and when we need to see them, we see them. It hurts to witness this team of heroes split and turn against each other and I'm glad it does, because it pays off for how we've grown to love these characters. You feel and understand why Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are on opposing sides of this 'Civil War' and can relate to their motives.Despite the huge roster of superheroes in this movie, I would argue this still feels very much like a Captain America story, and rightfully continues the narrative we've been following since his first solo film in the MCU. I would even go as far as to say that having all these characters here actually benefit the story. We see how each event occurring in the film affects both sides, which is crucial to witness for story purposes. The story has two main plot points that seamlessly blend together. They are both clear, exciting and relevant. As always Marvels visual effects are off the bloody scales, and though their film scores can be a little forgettable I really enjoyed the score to this film.If the Russo brothers have proved anything, it's that they can translate characters from comic books to film with perfection. Making each superhero feel real and relatable, Captain America: Civil war embodies just that. The film is a comic book story adapted into a well paced, action packed yet heartfelt superhero drama. It questions the responsibilities and liabilities of such heroes and who their affairs may concern, that being us. A powerful and exciting movie everyone must see."
" Great suprises and action but questionable plot
",-0.0644,0.9423,2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I caught myself a few times calling bullsh#t on the plot, even though they had good ambitions for the main idea.
The movie had some awesome surprises, I really did not expect some of the content. Also the action was great, new gadgets to see which havn't been in previous MCU movies.
Probably one of the better MCU movies."
" Explosive
",0.0,0.0679,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"31 December 2016. Most of the time, more and more and bigger and louder doesn't often result in better. This Captain America somehow manages to assemble a lot of superhero action into one movie and make it into one totality of an experience in diversity and style and cinematography that explodes on the screen. At the same time, somehow the director is able to retain a sense of individuality and focus on a few superhero characters so that a major theme of a morality play between individuality and centralized, governmental public interest is retained. This movie may be the ultimate limit to how far a superhero ensemble can go before it becomes a helpless confused mess. Even the ultimate explanation and motivation of this convoluted manufactured conflict reveals a deeply tortured emotional underpinning, unlike most other super epics recently shown. In sum, Civil War is rather unique in standing out of the crowd with its ability to balance its many characters while retaining an intimate and personal storyline."

" CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR : THE AVENGERS ARE STILL THE BEST!
",0.1511,0.9828,2019-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Civil War is the 3rd part of the Captain America movies.It is about the division of the avengers into two groups, that happened after the government wanted them to sign the Sokovia Accords, forbidding the Avengers to take their own decisions. One part supports this law, whereas the other one doesn't, and becomes outlawed.This movie is one of the best marvel films, because despite it's a Captain America movie, we can see all the Avengers on this film, and it surprised me. The actors are so good in their role that we are captivated by the movie, we have our eyes glued on the screen. The story is very original because we have superheroes who become outlaws. I didn't really paid attention to the soundtrack, but it makes an important part of the movie ( A movie without score isn't very interesting... ), and the best thing of this movie is that Civil War includes too new superheroes like Spiderman or Black Panther, for the first time on the MCU ( Marvel Cinematic Universe ). The antagonist takes his revenge on the Avengers because they ""kill"" his family on Sokovia ( you must see Avengers 2 before this movie to understand the plot ), but loses, and it is original too.This movie is such a great film that you feel like a young child after watching. The Russo Brothers are very amazing directors. If you like Adventure, Sci-fi, action and Superheroes, this movie is for you."

The comics did this storyline a million times better, and this movie left me with such a burning hatred of the MCU that I've refused to watch another Marvel film. They turned Captain America into a stupid, grunt, who is unconcerned with the fear and upset of billions of defenseless people. Black Widow into a traitorous backstabbing witch . and Scarlet Witch into a spoiled, uncontrollable terrorist who should have been arrested and had her worthless self thrown in jail by the end of the second avengers movie instead of being turned into an avenger.

" Dismal, tedious, overstuffed, and unearned crossover
",-0.6124,0.9714,2018-12-30 00:00:00,4,"Let me first start off by saying that my view on this film is a bit biased because I never liked the idea of a Winter Solider sequel and the Avengers Civil War being one film to begin with. I do find it very ironic that this film released the same year as Batman v. Superman because both films shared very similar if not practically identical flaws - yet one was properly negatively received whilst the other got much high praise that I still do not understand. Let's look at the flaws both films share and then I'll talk about the other reasons as to why I didn't like CW.Unnecessary villains - Isn't the theme of BvS and CW supposed to be heroes vs. heroes, as in a conflict strictly between the heroes? If so, then why do both movies more or less ruin that premise by adding in unnecessary and ultimately worthless villains like Lex and Zemo? The latter had a good character arc and good motivations for wanting to drive the Avengers apart, but it just doesn't work when the whole theme is supposed to be heroes vs. heroes.Spent too much time setting up other films - Much like Age of Ultron, I found that this film mostly set up events for the remaining Phase Three movies more than it actually focused on the story at hand. We have Spider-Man thrown into the mix for no reason other than setting up Homecoming, whilst BvS had Wonder Woman thrown in for no reason along with a bunch of Justice League teasers. Black Panther's arc in CW is great and feels relevant to the story, but he doesn't get enough time which is a shame because he is easily the best part of the entire film.Tedious and depressing - I personally found both films extremely dragged-out and lacking in the entertainment factor, which is even more surprising with CW because Marvel at their worst are usually entertaining. This film, on the other hand, consists mainly of tedious and boring lectures from Ross and its atmosphere is often dismal such as Tony's visit to the Raft. There are a few scenes here and there that feel more in the spirit of your average Marvel movie, such as the airport battle - but directly after that, it's back to being boring and depressing.Faux character development - Both films try to fool you into believing that their long running times are necessary for character development, which would work if those 2 and 1/2 hour running times consisted mainly of development - but they don't. The big difference between the two is that CW has actually convinced itself of its own lie and genuinely believes that its contributing to development. A good example of this would be the first scene with Wanda and Vision - the movie wants you to believe that this scene is developing these two characters and providing you with the reason as to why they fall in love, but in reality it is just pointless filler.In addition to those flaws shared between BvS and CW, my main reason for not liking CW is that I feel like this film should have never been titled ""Captain America"" unless it was actually going to be a proper Steve Rogers standalone like Joe Johnston's underrated First Avenger and the excellent Winter Soldier. Instead this film is basically Avengers 3 but without Thor and Hulk. If it had been titled ""Avengers"" then maybe I would be less harsh on it, but as is I feel cheated by it. Tony Stark is at his least likable in this film; tied only with Iron Man 2 for the worst portrayal of his character in the MCU. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, we get cheated out of multiple battles. Crossbones gets killed off within the first 20 minutes or so and the other Winter Soldiers created by HYDRA are killed by Zemo, and both of these are huge middle fingers to the audience masquerading as clever plot twists.On top of all of that, the film pretty much ends just the way it began. Yes Rhodes had a minor injury, T'Chaka was killed, and Zemo was locked up, but it ended with Steve Rogers agreeing that the Avengers would come back when they were needed - totally defeating the purpose of Civil War.All in all this was pretty much a WWE Raw episode with superheroes and an unearned, unworthy, overstuffed sequel that couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be a Winter Soldier follow up or the Avengers Civil War. As someone who mostly enjoys the MCU, this film is at the bottom three of my list and it is only worth watching on repeat viewings for Boseman's excellent Black Panther IMO... and Stan Lee's cameo which was admittedly hilarious."
" New phase starts with a bang
",0.0,0.9468,2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,Another great popcorn flix by Marvel. Marvel seems to know have gotten its movies right after its inconsistent start from 2009 - 2014. It seems that Marvel is not afraid to add more characters and the edition of Spider man shows that.A fun movie and I will give it a solid 8/10

This film expertly juggles action, drama, humor and multiple character storylines in a way that almost makes you almost forget that this is the longest Marvel movie to date. The plot is compelling and the actors play well off of each other.

" Civil War takes you into territory not many comic book movies do
",-0.5994,0.9759,2018-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Captain America: Civil War was more of an Avengers movie to be honest but still carried about it an air of independence to push it through. The major issue discussed and tackled in the film is one not many comic book lovers or viewers alike ask themselves,"" What happens at the end of the day when the battle is won? Does everyone have a happy ending ? Are the innocents who died in the way accounted for?"" This movie tries to tackle these issues in the most Marvelous of ways possible. High stakes, interesting plot details , big battles , spectacular action sequences and a final battle that is probably the best I have seen in a while. All while packing enough punch to dazzle both critics and fans as well as the movie - goer's wallet; for good measure."
" One of the MCU's Better Flicks
",0.4404,0.9969,2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"In 2011, the Marvel Cinematic Universe unleashed their first feature starring Captain America during their first phase. In 2014, they brought back the avenger during their second phase with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Both movies have gotten praise from critics, audiences, and Marvel fans alike for their brisk pacing, highly coordinated action, and fun performances. So back in 2016, they presented another story with Steve Rogers and some more avengers, Civil War. As this was the first installment in the Cinematic Universe's third phase of their supposed story arch, I can say that they succeeded more than the previous endeavors.In terms of the plot, the film has a rather straight-forward albeit complex narrative with enough dark moments to keep it from getting stale. While the film does have a pretty weak start, it does pick up by the second act by showing off multiple twists and plot points that never overstay their welcome, and a nice continuation of the heroes viewing how they are seen. Considering this is about the team being divided based on control from the government, it really creates a valid point of view from each side, and the audience will definitely feel for both instead of one or the other.The funny thing to note about this movie is that although it has Captain America in the title, it surprisingly feels more like a Captain America and Iron Man movie, but an interesting one at that. The different points of view they have on protecting people by political standards really tangle their team up and it really creates a sense of dramatic tension between the two. While Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) give the audience a good enough reason to root for them, the other supers (like Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, and Hawkeye) contribute to the plot wonderfully by aiding their individual fellow mates. Add a nice balance of drama and comedy along with some tense action and dark material and the characters make the experience worthwhile.As for the introduction of the then new characters, the movie handles them pretty well for the most part. Even though they were used to get the fanboys in, the MCU'S take on Spiderman, the Winter Soldier, and Black Panther are well thought out and they give each super their own distinct personalities that play off each other well. You got Peter Parker being the dorky average new-comer to the team, the Winter Soldier as the one with the once murderous mindset now helping the Capt., and Black Panther being the one with a reasonable and tragic backstory which gives him the opportunity to let his warrior side shine through. That being said, Vision and Ant-Man end up contributing less to the group and don't even show up as much as you'd hope for. The villains themselves do have their motivations in tact though, which makes for some powerful chemistry between the realms of patriotism and government.One thing that many people look forward to in Marvel movies are how well the crew can showcase their effects, and this is no exception. Not only are the effects well crafted, but they never last too long so it can let the audience metabolize them enough. Even though CGI and motion-capture have been used poorly in the past, they have been used very well for these movies, especially considering that the crew members always have plenty to work with. Even the cinematography helps by adding suspense to each action paced shot, and it also takes its time to rest at the more serious moments. The one minor complaintI have is that they could've made some of the fights look a little less goofy and cartoony for their own good.But lastly, what this film succeeds at most is being a great Captain American movie. Despite the shove-ins from the Avengers and new-comers, it continues the storyline of Steve Rogers without rushing too much. After the horrible events that led to the brainwashing of his war partner Bucky that turned him into an assassin, Rogers now has to face two major dilemmas: freedom from government take down and the betrayal of his fellow comrades. The determination the man has just to help civilians in need without much rule from others is very commendable, even if his teammates disagree and try to solve it the old fashioned way: battling each other. What's even more shocking is how the character Bucky, or the Winter Soldier, is played out in this by showing how he did his most deadly mission known to man. When the continuity kicks in, it really shines thru to keep the characters in tact, even when it means learning something new about the past.After the fun first film and the disappointing second film (to me at least), this is definitely the best out of the Captain America films. Thanks to the brisk action, gorgeous action, well constructed story, and decent mix of humor and drama, Civil War might just be one of the MCU and the superhero genre's best. If you're a fan of Marvel, this is a definite recommendation, if you haven't seen it already. It's funny how before Infinity War, this was arguably the division's more serious and dark flick yet, and I couldn't be happier to remember it for the next decade."
" Yes, I hate the MCU.
",-0.25,0.1232,2018-12-02 00:00:00,1,"Superhero overload, nostalgia fest, part of a longterm plan by Disney to take over the world. The directors of this movie don't make good movies. This is a waste of money by producers who could've put their money and time towards actual good storytelling.In the end, I just wish movies like this didn't exist so we could have more great movies and not just mass produced superhero garbage."
" Marvel continues in style
",0.4215,0.9846,2018-12-01 00:00:00,6,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third biggest commerical success movie-wise from 2016 and of course this was a new installment to the Marvel Avengers franchise. The title here makes it sound like a Captain American film and while he probably does have more screen time and more significance than pretty much all the other characters, he is not at the very center of it all as much as you could think from the title. But first things first: The directors are brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and they are Emmy winners just like their writers here Chris Markus and Stephen McFeely with whom they collaborated on other occasions too, also on a previous Captain America movie. But back to this one here. With the exception of Hulk and Thor, you have all the Avengers in here basically, some very brief only, but others with more screen time. And Spider Man joins the gang too. Plus Black Panther before his own movie. At 2 hours 30 minutes roughly, it is a really long film, even for a Marvel movie.The main antagonist this time is played by Daniel Brühl, but he is really more of a schemer than a villain. On one occasion towards the end he says something along the lines of the Avengers having defeated much stronger opponents, so his only chance to destroy them is to cause conflict from within, which means provoke the Avengers in going up against one another. And he does come pretty close in fact, for example when showing us how Iron Man's parents were killed. There is a civil war between two groups of Avengers eventually and the original cause of conflict refers to innocent victims during fights between Avengers and super villains. Are they evitable? How much guilt do the Avengers carry with them? These innocent victims also explain Brühl's character's motives, even if somehow this explanation did feel a bit weak to me given the huge uproar it creates with Avengers fighting each other for death and life. Oh well maybe Thor's physical superiority as well as Hulk's muscles would not have fit in there. Then again, they probably won't care too much about human victims either. C.A. could have needed this duo I suppose.All in all, it was an okay movie I think, not among the best or worst the Avengers have to offer, certainly not as good as Infinity War, but better than Age of Ultron for example. And the story felt pretty creative as well, certainly different for once and the idea of the actual conflict and how it is like a battle from within this time, not the traditional fight against a powerful enemy (Thanos anyone?) made for a nice change. The late Stan Lee has perhaps his funniest cameo in any Avengers film here and I already wondered if I had overlooked him this time because he entered the movie so late. As for the cast list all in all, it is really a star-studded ensemble, but yeah obviously this was going to be another big hit, that much was safe, so it should not come as a surprise to anybody that the likes of Tomei, Freeman, Hurt and Slattery are included in here. For me the last two were really a nice little surprise as I think Hurt is easily among the finest actors from his generation and how can you not love John Slattery, Mad Men fan or not. Shame he was gone so quickly.Yes there are a few aspects I did not like, but these weren't too frequent. One was fairly considerable though, namely how quickly Stark changed his mind eventually and reunited with his old buddies, even if they were criminals now. This left a bit of a sour note overall without a doubt. Also seeing tiny Spider Man being able to stand up against the real superheroes did not feel too realistic, he really seemed like a liability to me with his lack of experience. But for me, the presence of Ant-Man, regardless of him being small, normal-sized or a giant was very welcome. Love Paul Rudd and the character, maybe even my favorite from the whole gang. I probably don't need to make a recommendation here as honestly, if you consider watching this one, you should have seen enough Marvel material already to decide for yourself, but if I had to, it would be a positive recommendation for sure, not an enthusiastic one, but yeah, the good aspects here are far more frequent than the weaker aspects. A bit surprised this one did not get in at the Oscars at all. Go see it nonetheless. Oh well, pretty much everybody already has anyway, right? It's fun, not entirely pointless even, and runs by quickly, does not feel like 150 minutes at all."

The direction is really good. The screenplay is really good. The casting is really good because the casting team added to just the avengers by including black panther, ant man and various other future characters and successful blends them all together. The acting is incredible no one actor really stands out which is really good from a ensemble perspective. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."

It's not really just about Captain America in this.But on the whole, it's not the best of the trilogy but it is still a good watch towards the second and third act. I love the dynamics between all the characters (including Spider-Man, played to perfection by Tom Holland!) and I also appreciate the emotional moments towards the end when the Avengers are broken and it's two leaders are forced to fight.A recommended watch but it's not as enjoyable as Cap's first two movies."

The story is one of politics within the Avengers being that the government want them to have them only avenging when they want them too. You know kinda like any government lol.

" Some of Marvel's Best.
",0.6369,0.9947,2018-09-11 00:00:00,7,"From what I can tell, this seems to be the first MCU movie that has somewhat lasting consequences. I don't want to say that it felt grounded in reality, but it was very refreshing to see some kind of acknowledgement of all the controversy that would logically arise from having superheroes exist in the world. I had a friend ask me whose side I was on in terms of the peace accords, and I had to say that I really didn't know. Obviously there is some indication that we're supposed to side with Captain America, but the ideological conflict isn't really resolved by the end of the movie. I'm going to put this out there as more of an unfounded theory than anything else, but I think that the powers that be in the world take Iron Man's side in this argument in most cases, preparing for what could go wrong to the point that nothing good can be done. The Avengers are powerful people with no loyalties or affiliations, which makes them volatile in a way that the rest of the world isn't ready for, and I was very glad that this was acknowledged even though it was sort of ignored after the airport fight.Speaking of which, I must admit that the airport fight is very good and re-watchable. It feels a lot more like an X-Men fight scene where the outcome is determined by who is on what side at a given moment because of whose powers are nullified by the opposing side. Some of the light tone and humorous moments in the scene felt a little cheesy, but it made sense since they were all friends fighting each other. However, it is kind of hard to take certain aspects of the movie seriously when there are so many jokes squeezed in everywhere else. The other action scenes in the movie were also quite impressive and well-structured. Since it's Marvel, I knew that things would pretty much turn out okay, but consequences were felt right from the opening fight.I very much liked the introduction of our new heroes, Black Panther and Spiderman. Andrew Garfield was better IMO, but I think Tom Holland gives a likable and distinct personality to perhaps the coolest superhero ever. The overall plot wasn't exactly forgettable but wasn't memorable either. Ditto to the ending which may have been surprising to those who saw it in theaters, but I had heard how it ended and found myself a little detached from the climax.Most of the reason I watched this was to catch up for Black Panther and Infinity War. If you're trying to catch up on the MCU, you have to see this movie. There's not really two ways around it. This is pretty much Avengers 3, not 2.5. If you just want to see Black Panther, you don't have to see this or any other movie for that matter. However, I enjoyed and appreciated this more than I expected to. It proved that the people pulling all the strings at Marvel care a lot about the overall story that they are telling and are capable of balancing a lot of different characters in one movie, while making it look fairly effortless. It also showed that they were willing to go beyond what was expected of them and gave fans, or at least me, confidence that the build to Infinity War would pay off. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."
" Battle of the Avengers
",-0.3818,0.8301,2018-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Although the Avengers have managed to thwart several attempts by criminal organizations to wreak havoc upon the world, a newer problem has emerged which concerns the incredible damage done in those areas where the battles have occurred. So in order to address this issue the United Nations comes up with a plan to place the Avengers under the strict control of a special multinational panel. Unfortunately, this idea doesn't please all of the Avengers and as a result half of them decide to follow ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and leave the group while those that remain agree with ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) to accept U.N. authority over them. Unfortunately, things become much more intense when Captain America and his allies do battle with a criminal mastermind and thereby not only break the U.N. mandate but also force the remaining Avengers to attempt to apprehend them so that they can be tried and punished for their actions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had its share of action from start-to-finish with a multitude of superheroes sharing the big screen. To that effect, while I liked the addition of ""Spider-Man"" (Tom Holland) and ""Ant-Man"" (Paul Rudd) I must admit that the abundance of characters became a bit too much at times. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed this picture for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
" Heroes will fall.
",0.5106,0.6389,2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Following my viewing of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I couldn't wait to see what lay in store for Steve Rodgers so when the first trailer for Captain America: Civil War dropped, I was ecstatic to see it given how big of a fan of the MCU I am. So in May of 2016, a friend and I went to go see it and I left the theater awestruck at what I had just witnessed and after rewatching it in preparation for Avengers: Infinity War, the movie still holds up albeit with a few small flaws. From its complex themes, incredible action and acting, Captain America: Civil War is another gold standard for the MCU and comic book movies in general.The film begins in 1991 where an indoctrinated Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier is sent to track down a car transporting cases of serum for super-soldiers. We then cut to one year following the events of Age of Ultron where Cap, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow attempt to stop former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow from pilfering a biologic weapon, only to have Rumlow blow himself up and in the process, the team accidentally kill several Wakadan citizens. Following this, US Secretary of State Thunderbolt Ross visits the Avengers in Upstate New York and tells them that in light of recent events involving superheroes and the collateral damage they've caused, the United Nations are preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will place the team under UN control only to be used when the UN feels it is necessary. The team is split over this new turn of events. Tony Stark, having remembered what happened in Sokovia and his role in creating Ultron agrees to the accords while Steve is reluctant to sigh, having more faith in the superhero community rather than the government. But just before the accords are about to be approved at an embassy in Vienna, the building is bombed and Bucky is blamed. Among the dead is the King of Wakanda, T'Chaka whose son T'Challa swears vengeance on Barnes. Steve, now aware that his friend is still alive goes after Bucky but the two are apprehended and placed under arrest. Now, the Avengers must take decide who to stand with as Tony and Steve come closer and closer to waging war on each other while a villain determined to see the Avengers fall orchestrates a devious plot.Back in the 1940s, it was so much more simple to distinguish who was good and who was evil when watching a movie but now, it's become much more complicated when assessing the events that have happened in previous MCU movies. The threats the heroes must face in these films have become so unlike anything else in previous superhero movies and some of these calamities have been carried out unintentionally by those heroes who seek to only do good in the world only to bring death and ruin as shown by Captain America and his team. The discussions on how to react or handle such a powerful group of individuals let alone control them is certainly compelling and fascinating as there are both pros and cons to each sides' argument as Tony strictly believes that The Avengers need to be kept in check following the events of the previous movies which is also driven by his guilt over unleashing Ultron upon the world while Steve is far more hesitant to do so due to what he dealt with in Winter Soldier and is compelled by the belief of superheroes operating without the consent of the government which is an interesting and thought-provoking idea and it helps to build upon the friction that's existed between Stark and Rogers since the first Avengers movie not to mention this animosity between the two serves the story well and proves a solid foundation from which future films in the MCU sprout from.The way the characters are handled here is nothing short of perfect as The Russo Brothers along with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely have taken the time to make sure that each character, be them hero or villain, has just the right amount of development as well as giving each a chance to have their moment on screen rather than have a vast amount of characters on screen at once thus making it impossible for the audience to really care about them, something X-Men 3 and Batman V. Superman did too much of and therefore, the audiences failed to care about the characters in those movies but with Captain America: Civil War, such is not the cause as I actually cared about all the characters and I understood most of their motivations clearly. When we first met Tony Stark at the start of the MCU, we saw him as an egocentric billionaire playboy who made weapons for the government but when he discovers that his weapons are being used for, Tony sees just how shady the government is and by Iron Man 2, he has come to distrust the government or any sort of authority. In the Avengers, he hacks a S.H.I.E.L.D computer system to discover defiled government files to which he says that an intelligence department that is scared of knowledge isn't a good organization. However, following the events of the first Avengers and Iron Man 3, Tony begins to feel like he's losing his grip on the Avengers which leads him to create Ultron which also leads to the death and devastation in Sokovia which in turn leads a character who never trusted the government now realize that he now needs to be put in check. Stark's whole character arc during the course of the MCU is him being more accountable and responsible for his actions so in light of that, is it really fair to assume that all other superheroes should be kept in check as a result of one man's blunder? As for Steve Rogers, the first Captain America movie give him a chance to be the hero he was meant to be while the Avengers provided him with an opportunity to prove himself in the modern world. Winter Solider gave him some much-needed character growth and showed us some of the tension going on within him that we never saw in the first two films. With Captain America: Civil War, the viewer sees Rogers at his most conflicted as he struggles even further with this new burden as well as showing a fair amount of new character growth that we have yet to see in the MCU. To add to that, Steve's enduring nature and desire of not wanting to concern anyone else with the conflict surrounding Bucky Barnes brings his character full circle. It's precisely what a person from the 1940s would do and what a person who is devoted to their friends would do ""until the end of the line."" The inner turmoil that Rogers faces along with his moralistic self-freedom combined with a never give up demeanor is what makes the character of Captain America so charismatic and engaging but also provides a solid foundation for the movie's major battle to be built on which makes for a more intriguing story rather than what Batman V. Superman tried to do. Now we come to Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier who may seem like the villain of this whole predicament but as it turns out, he comes across more as a victim due to the brainwashing Hydra subjected him to. Out of all the characters in the MCU, Bucky has one of the best character arks. As the Captain America films progress, the viewer saw him mature from being a sidekick in the first to being an indoctrinated assassin/pawn to becoming something in-between here and while we see clues throughout the film that his story has yet to be concluded, it was wonderful to see Bucky be conflicted about his past coming back to haunt him and see his relationship with Rogers grow. The story he is given here borders on harrowing and since we've seen his story unfold over the course of the last two Captain America films, the viewer is also feeling the effects of Barnes' story. It isn't so much that Barnes is a tragic hero like Anakin Skywalker, but rather it's the effects of what he has done in the past and how they have changed him that his character ark so memorable here. As for the villain for the picture, Helmut Zemo, he is at once dangerous as he is being ambiguous in a way no other villain in a Marvel movie has ever been before, not to mention he accomplishes his motivations without the aid of any superpowers much like what The Joker did in The Dark Knight. Rather than feeling like your depthless and two-dimensional villain that is seen far too often in movies these days, Zemo actually feels like a fairly unassuming threat to the Avengers and while he's nowhere near the threat that Loki or Thanos pose, he still proves to be a major damaging force to the team. rather than be a villain obsessed by word domination or money, here he's a man overpowered by his own anger and his lust for vengeance and will stop at nothing until he gets it and thus makes him of the best villains in the whole of the MCU.The film also brings up interesting questions that are thought-provoking as well as serving the story at hand rather than do what Batman V. Superman did where those same ideas are bogged down with pretentious themes lacking any real-world consequences while Captain America: Civil War fully embraces it's themes and uses them to great effect not just for the purpose of telling a story but also to make the viewer think. How far should defensive methods be placed on those who mean well but cause considerable amounts of destruction? Who should be held responsible for the damage caused by superhumans? Do the disadvantages of having superheroes fighting to save those in need counterbalance the advantages? Can the world put their trust in The Avengers when they are under the control of the UN? What if the UN sends the team to a place where they have no interest in going or what if there's an issue in a country like Iran or North Korea that requires the Avengers' presence but the accords won't allow them to interfere? All these questions that the movie raises as well as the contrast in every facet of the story is what makes this movie so wonderful and gripping to watch. Throughout the movie, The viewer is torn between choosing which side to stand with and which ideas they support"
" Best pre-Infinity War MCU movie!
",0.1511,0.9925,2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"Captain America: Civil War is the best one out of the Captain America Trilogy. The fact that this film tackles grown-up issues and asks a powerful question without being preachy or dramatic is nothing short of a major achievement. It features the best action sequences you'd get to see in any MCU movies (others have great action too, but this one just blows the mind). From Cap to Black Widow to Iron Man, everyone gets stylish action sequences. Cap's shield action is even exhilarating in this one. This film is an action-adventure, but plays out more like an action thriller. This time, Tony's look itself confirms the film to be an intense action film with intense performances. There are moments which would even leave you heartbroken. The screenplay is written with a lot of depth and perfection, making it the best MCU movie before Infinity War. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr deliver performances of a kind you'd have rarely seen before in a superhero film. You rarely get to feel you're watching Chris and Downey, the stars. You DO feel you're watching just Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Scarlett Johansson impressed big time in the action scenes. Note that she has got some of the best ones in the film. Other actors do a great job as well, especially Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Technically, this film is a masterpiece. From cinematography to visual effects to action sequences, this film wins in every department. The airport fight shot in IMAX is one of the major highlights of this film. At the end of the day, Captain America: Civil War asks you a simple yet double-edged question: whose side are you on? I still don't have an answer to this question."

Collateral damage comes home to roost for the Avengers superhero adventurers. Some agree to being, others do not. It's an interesting, topical story direction and it's a more mature and substantive picture because of it.
Compared to the previous films in the series, the fighting sequences have a little more purpose, showing the dynamics of their abilities, and while the set pieces go on too long, they are impressive. Tension reduces because it doesn't convince why the allies are opposing each other with lethal intent. What the producers gain in satisfying their growing and committed audience, viewers unaccustomed to the Marvel Universe films will feel it is overstuffed with characters. All in all, an exhilirating adventure."
" An exciting action pic, but...
",0.4939,-0.708,2018-07-17 00:00:00,7,"...the underlying theme is the clash between American exceptionalism (we know best and we'll do what we want, when and where we want) and, on the other side, responsibility to the people and the rule of law, both nationally and internationally. And unfortunately the writers appear to have opted for the plot to make the former appear to be the correct attitude, in compliance with the US Republican Party agenda. I believe that is why so many people were profoundly disappointed with this film, despite the opportunity to see their favourite superheroes in action again.
It actually started out on a positive note, reminding people that combating the bad guys should try to take into consideration the citizens they're there to protect and to avoid all the mayhem that has so far been written off as unfortunate collateral damage (too bad, sniff, tear). Remember how Hancock was told: you can't go around doing things like that! And the last time 'that' meant a city being dropped from a considerable height.
Not only does that sort of thing cause serious loss of life - remember the role to 'protect humanity', not spin another sequel (if these films are to have any relevance to humanity beyond simple escapism) - but it also has other consequences, like sparking resentment and a desire for revenge. And that is ostensibly the subject of this exciting episode. But then there's that nasty subplot..."
" A fantastic thriller with some amazing action sequences.
",0.8316,0.9695,2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,"With amazing, heart-pounding action sequences, an intriguing character-driven storyline and several fantastic character introductions, 'Captain America: Civil War' is definitely of the MCU's best and also one of the very best in the genre. This is largely due to the way in which its 'superhero' aspects come second to its 'thriller' ones, meaning that the film is about much more than CGI extravaganza. All of the action feels entirely grounded, despite the inclusion of various clearly ungrounded superpowers, and the focus on practical hand-to-hand combat makes the film feel much more palpable. The movie is also full of emotion, as we see characters that we have grown to love pushed to their limits and forced to do things that go against their 'hero' personas, which again adds a sense of weighty realism to the picture. It's a constantly enthralling political thriller, and a lot of fun that never drags, despite its 147 minute run-time. 9/10"

If you're in the business of saving the world/galaxy/universe, you are the competent governing authority philosophically, morally, legally. By what right can the UN claim authority? They have no mandate or competence to deal with such tasks. Many of their members are illegitimate or obsolete shells. The US isn't really a country anymore than the EU is. Feudalism 2.0 has landed in the West with both feet. With geography being much less important to the wielding of power than feudalism's first go round. Then we're treated to Vision's brilliant theory that since the number of heroes has increased that's responsible for the increase in super villains and ET invasions.

The fighting sequences and effects were obviously good but the storyline sucks. The unimportant fights and events are introduced that may be good to watch for visual effects but these do little to make us like it on a closer look. Most of the events seem to be unrelated and cut-off from the main story like Ant-Man entered as a sudden and so did the Spiderman.
The concept of the misuse of powers of avengers is very well a good idea but it could have been presented well while simplifying the story. It seemed like everyone out there is a superhero leaving no room for commons......
Nevertheless, I'm still a Marvels lover and come back to see what there in the next parts."

" Split of the Greatest Heroes of the Earth
",0.8176,0.9977,2018-06-13 00:00:00,9,"Split of the Greatest Heroes of the EarthThe film ""The First Avenger: Confrontation"" is the second loudest film comic this year, which tells us about the battle of superheroes against each other, after ""Batman vs. Superman"" and is a screen version of the comic ""Civil War"" - one of the most significant and large-scale events in the universe comics Marvel. As always, Marvel made a great movie. What did I like about it? Explain in order.1. The plot. In ""Confrontation"" the plot turned out to be very interesting and, most importantly, not trivial. It is difficult to determine until the very end which of the heroes is right and who is not, and even if you have taken some position, at the same time it is difficult not to understand the other side of this conflict. In this story, every hero, every team is both right and wrong. In the struggle of heroes, everything can not be clearly divided into black and white, and in this contradiction there is a huge plus of the plot of the picture.Humor, although it's not so much, is still present and remembered. Especially, in this regard, the scenes with the Person-Ant and the Spider-Man are strong.Also very pleased with the final of the picture, which turned out to be as contradictory and ambiguous as the confrontation itself.
2. Characters. Heroes and their motives are revealed in the film quite full and do not make them doubt. Of paramount importance are, of course, the leaders of the warring teams - Captain America and Iron Man.The captain does not appear to us as an ideal hero, but a man who is compelled to go against all to protect his friend and the ideals in which he believes.Iron man is also shown somewhat differently, he believes that all heroes need control and are ready to obey a new law, which, he believes, will be able to protect the world from new dangers.Among the new heroes is worth mentioning the Black Panther, who plays one of the main roles in the film. For him, the film is like a test before his own solo project and we get about him only an initial presentation.Of course, one can not help noticing the Spider-Man, who personally for me was one of the main reasons for going to the movies. The spider turned out really new. It's hard to say whether he will be the best of all previous ones, but I can say with confidence that he is already sharply different from his previous incarnations, largely due to the fact that the role was taken not by an adult, but by a real teenager. Separately, it is worth mentioning and the voice of the character, the voice reflects perfectly that the hero is just a child and an inexperienced superhero who is just starting his fight with Evil. In my opinion, the filmmakers correctly decided that they did not once again show the story of the origin of the character, but present it as a ready-made hero.The new villain Helmut Zemo turned out to be very interesting and memorable, thanks to the fact that he is the most ordinary person who managed alone, using only his mind and hatred, to resist the Avengers. It will be interesting to see this character in future films as well.
3. Action. Action, as in any film on the comic books Marvel, is one of the main components and here he, as usual, at the height. I have nothing more to add here.In the end, before us is one of the most successful films of the cinematic universe of Marvel, which allows us to take a fresh look at familiar characters and leaves us in a pleasant anticipation of future films."
" Captain Avengers
",0.0,0.9973,2018-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Which side do you take in this star-studded cast? Before I answer that question, let's establish the ground rules. The political intrigue is very similar to Batman vs. Superman, and you can't really fault Civil War for coming out just a couple months later. Basically, after the opening action scene causes much destruction, the government wants to take over the wheel and pin some accountability and control over these meta humans. After montages of previous Avengers moments and some sob stories for personal reference, Tony Stark thinks for somebody besides himself and signs with the government. This is supposed to put a band-aid over the rift and still allow for safety; Steve Rogers disagrees. If they have to obey a superior officer to give the green light, it may be too late, he argues. And both have valid points and the rest of the superheroes take their sides.That's the gist of it. And I mentioned the opening action sequence. Well, I kinda lied because first a flashback to how Bucky became the Winter Soldier was needed to create another divide in the heroes. I'm not sure if a simple flip-flop would work, you would probably need an additional scene before the transition, but to have a flashback and then an opening action scene is like you wanted to open the movie with one of them but needed both scenes and decided to simply put them back-to-back.Now, the biggest flaw of the film is staring down all of us. Captain America: Civil War... Wait, so what point am I making? There's a dozen heroes or so in this film, but the title is still technically a Captain America movie. What this does is try balancing two aspects: a personal focus on Captain America, but also providing a broad stroke with all the Avengers. The result is slightly muddied and not as crisp as it should be. And the reason I may be being a little tough could be contributed to The Dark Knight Rises. I love that film; one aspect it couldn't control (although I thought Nolan handled it so well) was the fact that it had to follow The Dark Knight. Similarly, the previous installment The Winter Soldier is easily in my top 5 superhero films, possibly and probably top 3. It's smart, crisp, and full of terrific action. And Civil War hits most of the marks-- just not as many as the previous film and that's okay and understandable.What the Captain America movies have always succeeded at the most in the hand-to-hand combat. This movie continues with those great fighting scenes. Before we get to the obvious showdown, I do still have stuff to complain about. With the Winter Soldier acting as a fugitive for large portions of the film, there's a couple chase scenes. And the movement of jumping from a building into a cartwheel to avoid impact doesn't look smooth; this continues when Black Panther is introduced and there's a big chase with cars in a tunnel. The movement isn't fluid-- this hearkens back to the sub-par CGI from the first Captain America movie.Okay, okay, my heart isn't completely spattered with black ink spots. The showdown excels on every mark. This isn't nearly as dark and fatal as Batman v Superman, so the dialogue that ensues is full of pep and hilarity-- and yes, Spider-Man is one of the funniest along with Ant-Man. Of the newest additions to make their appearance, my favorite goes to Black Panther. His motivation is pretty typical, but I think he was handled really well and with an overall air of coolness and royalty. Additionally, Captain America's suit looks really good, and the way all the different superpowers clash is a blast to watch.Behind the back-and-forth between our heroes, there's a story that keeps itself going, but again not to the same power and tenacity as Winter Soldier. And after the initial action, there was too much exposition afterward that lulled on. As I described the more light-hearted aspect of the fighting, I said that it helped that there wasn't really a fatality aspect involved. And this is absolutely true, but it also affects the climax briefly seen from the trailer. The grittiness of Dawn of Justice had more tension in wondering how far these characters might go, but with this film no matter how bloody a face might get, there wasn't really a concern that a major death would take place.All in all, there's a couple scenes in the film that make the entire film more than worthy to watch. And it's a solid piece in its entirety, but there's still cracks in its framework that prevents it from being one of the best. It's been awhile since I've seen Age of Ultron, but if I were to compare it to that, I'd easily recommend this film more. It doesn't surpass Winter Soldier, but there's enough to hold its own-- and setup future installments for that matter.

",0.0,-0.995,2018-06-12 00:00:00,5,"So... after a non-stop run of sequential violence (That's the story line of Marvell), now comes the PC curve, really?
Trying to hit the brakes, and do a cerebral attempt at a show, is a noble change up (not really), but doesn't work. it smacks of raw inauthenticity; it's the Marvel style and now a writer wants to be PC and sincere(?) Never mind the convention to be violent and then say you're not, and make the viewer feel guilty. Never mind the violent-tepid-violent frame, which throws the viewer off (it's like domestic violence syndrome... victim calls police, they show up, offender immediately feigns calmness and points to hysterical victim, which is what cops only see. And victim is at fault for thinking that!).
Never mind that hypocrisy. At least make sense whilst being confusing.
An Accord? Aliens blew up the world each move, Heros battle (gee, can't imagine why any global damage spillover), and so get rid of Avengers...? They should have said, ""Okay"", and go hide. See what happens. 
How about next time an alien race invades earth, the General stops them and has them sign a damage control accord. Maybe asks them to say ""sorry"" whilst they are fulfilling their agenda on destruction. Yeah, that feels right. 
And, in the story line, only Capt. Amer. sees footage? No one else sees the security camera of ""psychiatrist:, just go to war. Man, we had enough of that damn Stark conceited arse! (like previous movie said, he can't tell the difference between creating and destroying the world. That's who should be deciding things?)
""Now, lets be sensitive...unless we're not, but feel should be, while not to be... unless saying sorry, but don't..."".
Same approach-avoidant contradictions.
What you bet, to mix you up with Marvel's writer hypocrisy, the next epic movie is usual stock violence again. Hey, wait... it is! (Infinity Wars).
(From the nice old comic writer that brings you Jessica Jones)."

" Stop shaking the camera
",-0.4404,-0.987,2018-06-05 00:00:00,6,"Shaky-cam + rapid-edits + zoomed-in-too-close tight-angle-shots = the worst style of action/fight scene. This movie is plagued with this excessively shaky camera style. Frankly, I don't know why viewers tolerate this kind of thing. It looks horrible. I prefer to actually see what's going on during a fight scene, to see the fighting moves the stunt performers are pulling off, and not feel like I'm having a seizure. Let's count the Russo Bros directed Captain America movies among the worst offenders of this style, alongside the Taken and Bourne movies. I blame the directors, the Russo Bros, because the first Captain America movie in this series, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which was made by another director, actually did not have this problem. That's why the action scenes in that movie are so much more watchable than in Winter Soldier or Civil War, both directed by the Russo Bros. To be fair, the visual effects shots in this movie actually look fine. I'm convinced that different people were in charge of the effects-heavy shots vs the hand-to-hand combat shots, because whenever there are a lot of visual effects onscreen, the camera doesn't suffer from the shaky problem; for instance, when the visual effects-heavy characters (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ant Man, etc.) are fighting, it looks fine. It's when the hand-to-hand fighters (Black Panther, Black Widow, Bucky, etc.) are fighting that we're subjected to excessive shaky-cam and choppy editing. Stop shaking the camera, please!"
" A real hero
",0.5574,0.9944,2018-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Captain America Civil war is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely.
The Avengers used to be a strong team fighting for the same goal. But when the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's action, the team falls apart. On one side Iron Man who agrees with this Act and signs it and on the other side Captain America who refuses to sign. Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. The two superheroes build two teams who will face each other. Iron Man joins his forces with Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man and Captain America stays with Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man.This 2016 movie is an amazing work from Marvel. We really feel everyone's convictions and we understand why they fight. Chris Evans' acting is impressive, we can feel his emotions through the screen with his facial expressions. The fight between the two teams is well staged and we can assist to powerful fightings. The intersting side of this movie is that you can see everyone's abilities and it's not only focused on one hero. Steve Rogers is the typical american soldier who is loyal and faithful. He defends his friends and what he believes in.
I really liked this movie which changes from usual Marvel movies with every superhero in one team against the evil.This movie brought a great change in MCU and I'm excited to see what comes next!"
" War has BEGUN
",-0.5994,0.9118,2018-05-25 00:00:00,10,"The Captain America trilogy ends on a high note in the superbly acted, superhero blockbuster that pits our favorite heroes against one another. While some may complain that there are no stakes. There is no denying the emotional sequence between Cap, Iron Man, and Bucky that will have you cheering and crying at the same time. A fantastic script and some wonderful direction also give the story a grounded feeling, and with newcomers Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland in there MCU debut stealing the screen from their veteran counterparts. This is sure to be a film that will thrill all ages."
" Third time is the charm (for Captain America)
",0.4019,0.9791,2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie in theaters in the summer of 2016 when it was first released. I had seen the first two Captain America films and they were decent for me, if not great. But this exceeded my expectations. Not only do we get the Avengers established by the 2012 film but we also get several more of them. And you know what? As Homer Simpson would say, ""It's good! It's good! It's good!"" The characters have a lot of chemistry and no one is left out. Plus Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. I haven't seen Homecoming yet as of now, but it's on my to-do list. This movie had the best schism between our main heroes like the name applies. Who wouldn't want to see our heroes disagree and fight? The X-Men had their disagreements too, especially Cyclops and Wolverine. Anyway, that's not the point. The fact that the heroes squabble makes them more human. It makes them more relatable. Anyway, go see it!"
" Team Cap vs Team Ironman.
",0.0,0.4798,2018-05-10 00:00:00,8,"I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
" The lowest point on MCU? probably
",-0.3818,-0.9648,2018-05-09 00:00:00,3,"It is no secret that I am very critical of MCU films and have lost all hope in their content, if there was any doubt all it would take is a look at my review of Ragnarok movie.
However while Ragnarok was an insult to the Thor and Hulk as characters and their respectively amazing and deep storylines the Civil War is an insult to the audiences.
The downfall of MCU storytelling comes with Civil War, this film is so boring and so unimaginably stupid that I have yet to watch it and not feel the urge to have my palm meet my face in a facepalm so inevitable you would say it was 8 years into making.
The real problem here is the way the story goes about to justify its events when nothing in it makes any sense.
Anyone even remotely familiar with the Civil War ark of stories from Marvel comics would tell you that Civil War movie is not even in the slightest remotely like the source material.
Lets say for the sake of the argument that we are going to ignore the source material (Even though that is a big mistake for any medium that is basing its content on a source material that is established and well known) and just focus on what we are given we are presented with such a bad story telling it turns out to be worse than Iron Man 3's entire second half and then some.
This movie presents you with challenges that are none existent, like blames put on our characters that are baseless, in one scene we go through all the wrong the Heroes have done while completely ignoring the fact that literally none of these were at any part the heroe's fault and to top it off the one that was their fault (the situation in Africa in Age of Ultron) is not even addressed in that particular scene.
Then we have back and forward about what is right and what is wrong and it just falls flat with really little reason to consider any argument but the argument presented by Captain America.
You see that comes from inconsistent story telling, in another scene Captain America is considering reverting his decision only to change his mind again because of a simple thing as one person being kept hidden because they are probably unstable (hello? since when Captain America suddenly has a problem with that? did this dude forget Hulk being kept hidden a big part of Avengers 2 or other times they had to hide for similar reasons?)
The villain is worse than Iron man 2 and 3 combined, his actions are unnecessarily convoluted and go through complex hoops that makes you wonder if there is more about this character we are not being told.
For example he has knowledge about some stuff that he is going to use for his scheme.
Information exclusive to Hydra big guys and this guy had nothing to do with Hydra, so what gives?
This thing just goes on and on when it should have not taken half as long as the time it took to put 2 plus 2 together to get the answer which is 4 not 5!You see the reason CW comics was loved was its careful plannings, its very first seeds were planted long before the story ark ever started.
It also followed several huge catastrophic events that Heroes had messed up like Hulk going on a rampage that destroyed Las Vegas, the entire House of M ark and much more.
It was a labor of love, it took planning and good writing, clearly things CW the movie did not receive.
The action sequences are really well done and that is a given thing but that seems to be one of my bigger concerns too, these movies have moved past the comic book super hero movies and turned into normal Action flicks.
For the unimaginative and bad storytelling combined with lack luster sound design I give this movie 3 stars."

Well, this one is pretty bad. Not a single fight in this makes sense. I honestly have no idea why this movie was even produced. Was really boring, too.
But damn, the fights... People are switching sides the entire time, extremely confusing especially because there was no reason to fight. And then, when they fought, it just felt like a showcase of special moves. 
Some of the avengers don't want to be avengers anymore because they've caused too much destruction? Sure, let's fight the rest of the avengers who don't agree with us and cause a ton of destruction.
Wasn't even fun, but not dark either, just confusing and pretty ludicrous."

",0.0,0.9795,2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"There's a reason why Marvel has such a big fanbase, and why I am a part of it. This movie is extremely entertaining. The characters are consistent and interesting. The action and effects are nearly flawless. The story is engaging. Its hard for me to write reviews for this type of movie, because pretty much everything is done perfectly that the review would end up being redundant. Any nitpicks are drowned out by how entertaining this movie is. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you're a fan of Marvel."
" One of Marvel's Best
",0.6369,0.9979,2018-04-27 00:00:00,9,"While Marvel and DC are perpetual rivals, never before did they really go head to head with similar movies before the Spring of 2016. After the massive disappointment of Batman V Superman, Marvel gave it a shot with their own version, also an adaptation of one of the most popular comic stories of all time. I bring up DC because it's hard to think about Civil War without thinking of Batman V Superman because of how similar they are, and how close their release dates were. And it's quite clear that part of what made Civil War great was that it succeeded where Batman V Superman failed. This review is not just hating on DC, but it really is important. Right when this movie came out, the disappointment from BvS was still fresh on our minds. But enough about BvS, on to Civil War.Marvel has two types of movies, the mystical, cosmic ones and the earth-based ones. This is clearly the latter. It feels more like Winter Soldier than any other Marvel movie, and not just because it's a Captain America movie. There's a lot of talk about the politics within the MCU's world, which is vital to the plot. The Avengers are torn as to whether they should be put in check or not. For those who may not be interested in fictional politics, this will be rather boring. It's kind of like the politics in the Star Wars Prequels, only with way better writing. The Sokovia Accords are something interesting to thing about though. What if this was your world? Would you want them kept in their place? The characters in this movie is the most important aspect. You have the clear division between Cap and Iron Man, where the tension they built over the previous few movies destroys their friendship. At the end of the movie when they're fighting each other, it is actually sad. You saw them build a relationship over the past few movies, and now look at them. Of course, this movie's show stealer was Black Panther. Wow. Everyone knew he would be a fun character to watch, but he was much better than anticipated. The way his character develops makes for a very great sub-plot, which this movie definitely needs. Zemo is one of Marvel's best villains. He has no powers, no super-suit, no magic weapon, none of that. All he has is an idea and some Soviet secrets, and you could very well argue that he wins in the end. There's an interesting relationship between Scarlet Witch and Vision, where she takes Cap's side to and Vision takes Tony's, seeming more like a robot but yet with a bit of humanity in him. Most of the rest of the Avengers are just there for comic relief, like Ant-Man and Spider-Man. That's welcome though. Most of this movie takes itself quite seriously, and the humor helps keep the mood up. The action scenes are fantastic. The airport battle is the best MCU action scene (haven't seen Infinity War yet), and it's not even close. It goes on for 15 minutes, and it's fun to watch, climactic, and has some great lines thrown in. The final battle was epic, emotional, and a great end to a great movie. If there is one thing to complain about, the movie's a tad bit long. It's just over 2 and a half hours. It's still a great movie, and one of my favorite MCU films to date. Team Cap!"
" Conflict for the sake of conflict
",-0.5574,-0.9945,2018-04-25 00:00:00,4,"Marvel has shown it can make movies that, while formulaic, can still be enjoyable. Guardians of the Galaxy was a fun romp, as was Thor Ragnarok. Even the more serious toned ones such as Winter Soldier I got a kick out of. Civil War however, I detest. I'll start off with the only thing I liked: Spider-Man. He was fun to see on screen and had a good presence overall. 
Apart from that, this movie has the standard cliches that have come to adorn every Marvel movie such as underdeveloped villains and fight scenes every 30 minutes that have no stakes since you know it doesn't affect anything, but Civil War goes the extra mile by having a plot that could be resolved within the first five minutes if anyone bothered to talk to one another. The entire movie would be rendered moot if Steve went up to Tony and said ""Hey, Bucky has been brainwashed by HYDRA so everyone he killed wasn't his choice. he also killed your parents. How about we try to deprogram him instead of lock him away where any Randy can apparently just break in a top secret government facility and trigger him to kill, so this never happens again."" but alas, we wouldn't have a movie. Also, how does anyone blame the Avengers for the conflict that happened in Avengers or Winter Soldier? like the Age of Ultron conflict can be pinned on Tony sure, cause he made Ultron, but this movie seriously tries to tell you that giant space aliens and nazis showing up is the Avengers fault somehow, as a result of Iron Man being around. I'm pretty sure Loki and HYDRA would have still done their plan regardless of the Avengers being around or not. The entire ""debate"" about the whether the Avengers should be controlled by the government or not becomes completely one sided when Winter Soldier and this very movie prove that they absolutely should not be. When you have a movie universe where government facilities can be infiltrated by any Randy on the street (as the villain of this movie is literally just some guy who does that exact thing because his family died, with no help at all), and who also do nothing at all, then handing 'roided up super soldiers, metal suits that can kill anything, and psychics all on a silver platter is moronic. Don't pretend to have a debate when there isn't one in sight. 
Onto the average, the CGI is what you come to expect from Marvel; not horrendous, but at the same time not great, anything CGI doesn't have a real presence on screen. The acting is fine, the direction is plain and could have been done by anyone, cinematography is average, editing is average, fight scene choreography is the same from any standard movie and there's a cut almost every second to try and hide how lazy it is (a shame especially since there are so many fight scenes you think they would put some effort into it). I honestly enjoyed Suicide Squad more, because while that is even worse than this movie, more entertainment can be drawn from Jared Leto and the rest of the cringe crew from laughing at how bad the movie is.
I give this a 4/10 for being a movie pumped out from the factory line with no care, heart, or creativity involved, only the sense that you're watching an ad for Spider-Man and Black Panther."
" Not the worst thing in the world, but not the best
",-0.5275,-0.8277,2018-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Now, you have to hear me out on this one. The movie was good, I get that, but what was bad about this movie is that it is just a set up for infinity war. yes there were some very good intense battle scenes and it was very exciting to see my favorite heroes battle it out, but there were weak moments that lacked my attention. and then the ending felt kinda empty. No one died, no problem was really resolved, it was just a set up for Infinity war. but, I would watch it again, because it was a good movie and did contain good dramatic elements that I enjoyed, and I look forward to seeing how this plays in Infinity war."
" Standard fare - but that's fine
",0.296,0.9841,2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,"If you're into the MCU, this is a solid offering. Interesting story, some good set pieces, new characters add to the dynamic without feeling intrusive, and it delivers on its title (despite necessarily pulling one or two punches for logic's sake). Does have a little too much of the recent tendency of feeling like an episode rather than a standalone film - it is independent enough to be enjoyable, and I understand this is sort of how the MCU works, but by this point there's so much going on you'd almost rather some of the threads were a little more self-contained. Nevertheless, aside from a few slightly over-convenient/inconvenient jumps in the storytelling (probably necessary given the runtime) it's actually impressively well crafted. It would have been easy for this to be a bit of mess, but it feels slick, and doesn't lose its way. Overall, nothing groundbreaking - difficult now that we can pretty much predict most of the characters' actions throughout - but it's a good solid effort, and worth a watch."
" Marvel's Biggest Misstep?
",0.0,-0.9804,2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,"In the same year of the well constructed Deadpool and the horrid Suicide Squad this movie nestles within competent and moronic. Joe and Anthony Russo two phenomenal directors who brought the thrilling Winter Soldier film in 2014 lost all of their style and interest in favour of a bombastic light show with little substance and minor moments of actual content worth the price of admission. It is comparable to the likes of pro wrestling. You come for the commercialization, colorful costumes, special moves, and decent one liners. These flicks are not known for there fascinating and ideology challenging plots. But with our titular characters coming to blows in what was hyped up as the battle that would tear the avengers apart, it feels shallow. The traits of Tony and Steve are entirely stripped in favor of orchestrating a conflict that will get our heroes into their suits to crack more jokes and make light of a terrorist manipulating a war victim into commiting atrocities. If you wanted a movie filled with silly jokes for kids, then make it that. The tone of this film feels as inconsistent as teenaged emotions (which is to say that is 50% of the demographic) and that is not a good thing. Not a single hero acts like themselves or what they were built up to be. Tony's guilt is actively the only sensible thing that propels the conflict. Caps motivations are so out of left field to me that it feels so coporate you can see the shadow of disney executives in some frames. Furthermore for a movie with such a large budget you could make it look as if your actors are in their suits and not rendered onto a PS2 era graphic. Not to mention the colour palette (dark grey or light grey), cinematography, shot composition, acting, and a million other factors that make this high budget hollywood flick feel like it was made by an Indie film stuido (many of whom could do far better.). For a film hyped up to have insurmountable stakes it feels like all of our favourites are made of rubber and only get hurt when the plot demands it. Say when Colonel James Rhodes falls from a height that would kill a normal man with or without a super suit becomes only paralyzed and not oh I don't know, dead? Another example of this is when Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff lays off the nigh invulnerable Black Panther with a small tazer. I understand it is a fictional universe with giant men but they could retain some level of consistency with their own take on logic. But to some up and quit my annoyed rambling, Captain America: Civil War is a bad movie in a year of horrible duds. The fights are shallow and obviously made to sell toys. The ""adult"" moments are forced and scarcely placed. The tension is nonexistent and our focal heroes are so out of character you cannot remember a single moment when they were actually likeable. The film is an example of seeing the success of a character and going the opposite direction of why people adored and related to them in the first place."

" Great SuperHero film though not a huge fan of The Ending
",0.2905,0.9765,2018-04-10 00:00:00,9,"I just watched this film and loved it. 
Has a very good story and great performances by the whole cast, even though it's a Captain America film all the Avengers shines. All have their great moments and great job to introduce Black Panther and SpiderMan for the First Time My Favorite Avenger is IronMan/Tony Stark : I love his sense of Humor and How he looks for for the people he cares the more like SpiderMan and Rhodey. Though he has big flaws too like his Ego and how stubborn he can be. He was about to forgive Bucky and see He was brainwashed when he did what he did those awful things and then He sees that video of his parents and Changes his mind for the worse. But at the end all are great good. This Cinematic Univerese took took me out of the stigma that SuperHero films have no good stories and it's just mindless action and CGI I'm not pretending they are the deepest films but they have well thought out stories with very engaging characters. The action it's incredible
The film has great action scenes with very tense fights which gets us completely glued to the screen. They give all the characters the proper time to their fights and see what's happening with each one of them. Great job on presenting both sides of that civil war and explain the arguments in favor or against the agreement. 
While I'm an IronMan fan during the whole film I kept switching sides and didn't want any of them get really hurt. Now the only thing I'm not happy with is The Ending. I'm used to the MCU always getting for us a very happy and uplifting ending which leave us with a smile in our face, so I don't like that they don't give us this time. Sure no one dies but I would have preferred the last part avoided and then see them all fight together again as a team against the Villain. It would have been much better that Tony rescued The Avengers from that prison and all went against Zemo and Tony to not watch that Video. So everyone would live happily ever after like we are used to with The MCU."
" Another Flawless Film Under Marvel's Belt
",0.5106,0.9974,2018-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Captain America: Civil War, stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan and a bunch of other Avengers and new faces in this emotionally driven action, drama, mystery, with a split of the team too for a very good purpose. The Russo brothers from The Winter Soldier come back to direct this masterpiece of a film and they have established themselves as one of the greatest directors in history from this film. With it's slower scenes feeling emotionally impactful and having a proper role to drive the story further and line up some of the best action sequences to date in marvel is one of the infinite things that makes this film perfect. With having the biggest cast out of any movie and the longest run time, this movie feels just like the others and that two hours and twenty-six minutes run time goes by in no time and makes you wanting more after that end credit sequence comes up. The writing by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely makes this movie the most grounded and realistic feeling film to date with it's fluent dialogue and great scene construction on paper. I honestly forgot that these were actors while watching this film because of how real they felt and the emotion in each scene. There isn't a single line of dialogue out of place in this film and making it by far the best script to date for marvel. Even the jokes that came into the film and some of the more comic relief characters made some of the most nail biting scenes funny and joyful at the most perfect times. And with it having such a big cast. It still feels like a Captain America film with the primary focus on Cap and Bucky and them finding the truth about some things. The acting is perfect, more perfect than any other film I believe in the MCU and that's thanks to Marvel casting the most perfect actors for their films and making them some of the most talked about names in history because of them. The biggest highlight for me is the sternness between Rogers and Stark in this film with some hints throughout the previous films on their possible blow up and this film uncorks that tension beautifully. And by the end I was in tears for the overall outcomes and finishing scenes showing the immediate aftermath of the events that have happened in the film. Captain America: Civil War is a flawless film with not a single problem to it between everything it has done and what is has lined up as well for future movies. Captain America: Civil War gets a 10/10"

It is full of good never exaggerated action, based on plan, cooperation, execution and consequences on people, relationship and soul deepening the humanity of the protagonists. The plot is the real winner of the movie for its involvement due to the relationship between the several characters, their stories and their mysteries. A really smart movie directed by the duo brothers which have almost realize their best movie since ""Captain America: the winter soldier"", movie that I reviewed distinguishing the first perfect part from the second half of it which appears to be less coherent. However this specific movie worth to be watched because it is a rare masterwork in the usual stupidity which affects holliwood standards. Surely, I will see it again also if I'm sure that some parts of the movie has been deleted because of runtime and I would like they were integrated in an extended cut though. I suggest everyone to see Avengers: Civil War."

",0.5267,0.9919,2018-04-04 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read a single coherent review for this film yet as IMDb seems to be full of angry fanboys that don't seem to realise how ridiculous comic book films are. If, like me, you are a little disenfranchised with the MCU films, and you tried watching BVS and realised D.C. will continue to produce utter bilge as long as Zack Snyder is around to make them ""dark and gritty"", you'll understand my trepidation before watching Civil War.I couldn't be more surprised at how good Civil War was. A comic book film that earns its dramatic moments, gives everyone a motive and a relevant amount of screen time, throws in some truly spectacular action sequences AND can make light of itself every now and then when it gets too serious BECAUSE IT'S A FILM ABOUT SUPER HEROS FFS. This film isn't perfect, I found myself trying to keep up with the plot in places as everything moves quite quickly. Additionally, the beginning feels a little rushed to get to the main bulk of the story and themes, but I can forgive it for actually having a good story and strong themes that it sticks to. The issue is the Fan boys / Zack Snyder fan boys that need to realise not everything needs to be super serious as that makes dull cinema. Nolan achieved it with his Batman trilogy BECAUSE HE'S AN EXTEMELY TALENTED FILMMAKER WITH A GREAT WRITER AS A BROTHER. Snyder consistently tries to make things more poignant without actually earning the right to be, resulting in boring cinema because we're not invested in his characters.Anyway, I could go on for hours about how moronic some of the reviews from fan boys are but overall this film is a great action adventure that I'm more than certain you'll enjoy if you watched the other MCU films."
" It's all about the bad guy - But Killmonger he aint!
",-0.3699,-0.7548,2018-04-03 00:00:00,7,"Upon my first viewing of this movie I loved it. Frenetic action, great comedy, and a good plot to keep you engaged. 10/10 on my first view.However, on second viewing realised the film was not just a vacuous super hero romp. The film does have a message. And like Black Panther, where the character Eric Killmonger stole the show, the hidden depth of this film is presented by the villain, Zemo. Also, like Panther, I found myself siding with the villain.So, Zemo sets events in motion to ensure the Avengers set upon themselves. His aim is to make the Avengers implode. But what is interesting is his motivation for doing this. Sokovia, a fictional European nation, is all but destroyed after the events of Age of Ultron movie. And our villain Zemo, loses his entire family due to the actions of American Avengers in that movie. So, Zemo life is destroyed his entire family killed. Collateral damage due to the actions of well intentioned Americans trying to 'make the world a better place'. Sound familiar! I think it is refreshing that Marvel/Disney are taking this approach to story telling. The Last Jedi also impressed me with the introduction of Benicio Del Toro character, DJ, who questions rebels involvement arms trading.Zemo is not as good as a character as Killmonger. He not as engaging and we do not spend enough time to fully feel his rage. But much like Killmonger, he has a point!"
" Another fine Marvel outing
",0.5574,0.978,2018-03-31 00:00:00,8,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is another Marvel Cinematic Universe flick that sees the series going from strength to strength; this is better than the last two CAPTAIN AMERICA films and on par with the highs of THE AVENGERS. The plot speaks for itself and takes things to an enjoyable political level as Iron Man and Captain America find themselves on opposing sides of the law. Despite a massive running time, this is a fast-paced and hugely enjoyable production, with a large cast featuring all manner of new superhero faces (Ant Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man all make their appearances here). The film's high point is undoubtedly the action choreography, which mixes wire work, seamless CGI, and expert fight choreography into a satisfying whole. The opening sequence with Frank Grillo's returning bad guy gets things off to a fantastic start and is only bettered by the incredible airport fight later on. All of the usual faces here and are either given a lot or a little to work with, and there's the right balance of humour and excitement, thrills and fun. I loved it."
" Great adaptation
",0.6249,0.995,2018-03-24 00:00:00,9,"The Marvel movies always brings surprises and wouldn't be different. On this title, arises the Wakanda hero Black Panther, on his first appariton. Another black hero working is Falcon. This is good, even talking about a subject so old fashioned. This subject shouldn't exist on 2018. But, lets get it on! About the movie. The best point of the plot for me is when started the deadlocks between Steve (Capt) and Stark placing each one in positions that on the actual days, really can be found. Stark, considered rebel pressioned by the government, for surprise, tends obey the laws and the champion of the freedom, american hero, starts to act an outlaw punisher. The writers really did something cool. Showing we don't need to be static with same thinkings and point of view about nothing. We're thinking beings, dinamic and can change anytime. But, in my opinion, only with ethics and searching for dialog. But, neither always good sense works on real world. Patience, dialog. And, this is the point so easy to notice, the writers and directors explored in an epic, spetacular, amazing battle on airport. Simply, fantastic. Even with the camera effect so used actually in Hollywood. I particularly don't see problems. Another point so strong in my opinion is about revelations. On this universe, the Stark's father, was the creator of the shield of the Capt. And, off course, after another battle, Tony, even defeated, don't waste the chance to tell it. Who looses? There are also a point that Stark discover his fathers murderer. Or at least involved but, if you still not watched this another masterpiece, I'll leave at least it to you.
Check it out! Worth!"
" One of the best MCU films ever
",0.6369,0.9706,2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"This movie has both the intense comic-book action expected of a Marvel movie and complex character conflict. (MILD SPOILERS) It is centered around the Sokovia Accords, which gives complete control over the Avengers to the UN, and how it splits them into two teams, Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Iron Man, who helped create the Accords, believes that, as he puts it, they ""need to be put in check,"" while Captain America believes that a) the UN, and the government, are ""run by people with agendas,"" and that b) - when it comes to safety, ""the safest hands are still their own."" Basically that the UN might use the Avengers for their own doing, and that the UN isn't going to know about every threat. I can see both sides to this argument, and don't 100% agree with either, although I'd probably say I lean towards Iron Man. The film also acts like your traditional sequel, as it continues the Winter Soldier's and Captain America's character arcs from Winter Soldier (which is also excellent) by having Cap go after him and try to help him be Bucky again. Overall, great action, great plot, great characters, great film."

" Easily the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie
",0.8555,0.9136,2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,"This is definitely my favourite MCU movie alongside Guardians of the galaxy both 1 and 2, Thor Ragnarok, Doctor Strange, Captain America the winter soldier and The Avengers.==Warning I have copied this next paragraph from the first review I saw==
 
The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. Were all great. The best scene is the fight at the airport with all of the avengers and the last fight scene when Captain America, Iron Man and The Winter Soldier.For a random reason I actually thought that Daniel Bruhl was Tobey Maguire invading the movie trying to get his role back as Spiderman. I hope we see Daniel return in a future film as Zemo. What I am confused about was like why wasn't Thor or Hulk contacted by the avengers for the fight.Paul Rudd definitely killed it as Ant-Man in this movie when he became Giant-Man and both Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland were definitely the right choices for Black Panther and Spider-Man.I hope Infinity Wars answers how Captain America will fight without his shield. Overall great movie I hope DC dose something similar to this with all of the Justice League in the near future."

" Russo's did it again!
",0.0,0.8422,2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,Russo's Winter Soldier was a successful attempt in blending a superhero blockbuster into a political action film that is relevant in today's politics with privacy vs security. They took another crack at it again by blending registration vs freedom. Iron Man and Captain America are on polar opposites fo the issue with Bucky in the middle. The other characters involved in the movie made it feel like an Avengers movie but there is no doubt that it centers on Captain's point of view. It is amazing that Russo has maintain this tether while including the many characters and not feel oversaturated. They are the right directors for the Avengers film.
" A fun, exciting movie with some questionable events
",0.6486,0.9588,2018-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Civil War succeeds in the areas that make many Marvel movies fun: a phenomenal, massive cast that works well together and great action sequences. I feel very similarly about this movie as I did about The Last Jedi: both exciting movies you're super engaged the entire time, but many character decisions leave you scratching your head. In Civil War, it seemed like a disproportionate amount of the conflict was driven purely by revenge, which seemed simplistic for such brilliant and nuanced people like Stark. The full-on Avengers battle seemed a bit unrealistic to me in how all the characters accepted it as inevitable, and as always in these movies, the action scenes seem super unrealistic in how resilient the main characters are and how weak the generic soldiers are. Despite some questionable events, the movie brought in a large cast effectively, and gives you an enjoyable experience."

I'm tired of them, and probably this was impacted by that.The premise to this seeing the superheroes go head to head is really interesting, and a geek's fantasy come to life. However, that all seems to get lost soon after, but Captain America is the show stealer but not helped by the creators trying to ram everyone in possible like a big fancy dress party, in order to advertise their new films to come (Black Panther, new Spiderman etc).Shame really, this could have been so much more. The comic book films are becoming tired and repetitive, despite the genuine efforts of some. There's a lot of life in them, but they need to divert a bit more. They aimed for that and then seemed to just divert back.Disappointed."
" Captain America - Civil War Review
",-0.5994,0.9981,2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Captain America - Civil War is a film directed by Russo Brothers. Back in 2016, watching the trailer excited me. But due to some reasons, I couldn't watch it in the cinema. Finally, when I watched it at home, I felt so bad for not watching this film in the cinemas. But still I was satisfied since I got the best that MCU had to offer.Plot: Due to recent events, the Avengers are divided into 2 factions over an Accord that would oversee the Avengers' activities.Story and direction: Russo Brothers nailed it when it came to The Winter Soldier. They opened so new dimensions to Captain America and MCU that I couldn't think of. So when announced that they would be returning for the third installment, I was overjoyed. The story encompasses all the events that have happened in the past eight years. The theme dealt with in the film regarding those who still suffer while the Avengers win, so gets attached with you. This is what instantly got me connected. Also we get the MCU dose of entertainment which never is off. The characters, even the new ones although minimal in their roles get their due importance in this film. You can understand as to why a person makes such a decision. Same can be said for the villain too. As usual, production design and VFX are top-notch. Never does it feel artificial, it feels so natural. The action sequences are jaw-dropping. Many people complained of shaky cam been quite often used, but I didn't notice any. Henry Jackman's score is awesome to hear especially during the Bucky-Cap-T'Challa chase scene and the climax in Siberia. I couldn't fault this film even in a single bit even in my 5th viewing of this film.Performances: Chris Evans is again on par excellence as Captain America. Robert Downey Jr I guess delivered his best performance as Iron Man/Tony Stark. A special mention to Sebastian Stan for wonderfully carrying the role of Bucky Barnes. Same goes for Anthony Mackie. Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson were alos great in their appearances. I missed Hayley Atwell in this film a lot. Emily VanCamp was great. Chadwick Boseman looked promising and can't wait for his solo venture. It was good to see William Hurt Back. Daniel Bruhl also was impressive. Paul Rudd reminded me again why he is perfect Ant-Man. Finally, Tom Holland. It's a Spider-Man that I have been waiting for years. Than you MCU for giving us the Spidey we love to see.Favorite Scene: When it comes to this many will say the Airport fight or the climatic battle in Siberia. But those are action scenes. Not that I am saying they are not great, but those don't count for me as a favorite scene. My favorite one would be the one-on-one Stark has with Peter Parker as to why he (Peter) gets up every morning. That scene impressed me a lot because of what Stark makes Peter realize in the scene.Verdict: Civil War is definitely the best that MCU has us to offer. The Russo Brothers again did it. They had a difficult task of handling an ensemble cast and they came out victorious. Can't wait for their Infinity War.I give it deserved 10/10."
" It was good
",0.4404,0.9892,2018-01-28 00:00:00,5,"It's a very enjoyable movie. The acting is fantastic, the special effects are outstanding, there are more characters, bigger fights and a lot of laughs that make this a good movie.I just didn't like it as much as the other films in the MCU. I didn't think it was believable story based upon the character development we have seen on screen. The story makes complete sense if you are familiar with the comics and slowly get to the Civil War, but to think that these characters would form two opposing groups so quickly after fighting together as tight knit team to save the world multiple times is a little puzzling if you are only watching the films.This movie also seemed more focus on the Avengers team instead of heavily focused on Cap. Since this is the third of his stand alone films, I felt the story line should have been a little more focus on him instead of making him just one of supporting characters. Tony Stark seemed to be the major focus of the film. He also had the most character development with conflict and resolution within himself. There are just some actors that take the spotlight when in a movie, and when Robert Downey Jr. is in the film for the major portion, the focus is drawn to him. That's not a bad thing, but when the movie is titled ""Captain America: Civil War"" you would expect the focus to be on Cap.As far as the story of this film goes, Tony Stark is the biggest surprise. Stark leading the fight to have government control over the Avengers just doesn't make sense with his character development in the films. He has always been against government control. In almost every movie, even this one, his character is one that doesn't want to be controlled by anyone, yet he is the leader for government control. Just doesn't make sense.My name is actually Steve G. Rogers, so I love practically everything Captain America, but just didn't love this one. I liked it, but just didn't love it."
" Too long, too cluttered with a weak plot
",-0.4404,0.2981,2018-01-28 00:00:00,2,"To begin with, this movie should have been at least 30 minutes shorter. They could have achieved this simply by eliminating a few of the fights scenes which were too long and too numerous to begin with. by mid-point in the film they'd become repetitive and just kind of absurd. I mean how many times do you need to see these people beating the hell out of one another?Secondly, the plot was borderline absurd. Yes, I know they tried to tie it all together at the end but it really didn't work, it wasn't believable, and it really made little sense. I think another reviewer nailed it, they'd run out of bad guys and needed an excuse for all of the good guys to start pounding on one another. It got very old very quickly. A few other things I found absurd (and just for point of reference, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Avengers movie, not so much the second. I also thought CA, Winter Soldier was a great movie); Their version of Spiderman doesn't work. I know he's meant to be fresh and funny and irreverent but he just comes off as stupid and annoying. Ant Man, I remember Ant Man comics as a kid, thought they were ridiculous then and I can't believe they'd put him in a movie now, let alone give him one of his own. My wife, who watches some of these movies with me, laughed out loud when he showed up, and not in a good way. Paul Rudd tries really hard and god bless him it's not his fault, they're asking him to play Ant Man!The witch chick, I can't even remember her name, also doesn't fit at all with the rest of the characters here. She may be fine in an X-men movie but her character doesn't belong in an Avenger movie. Didn't work at all.Overall the movie was convoluted, clunky and way too long. I think they've over-used and worn out most of main characters and brought in new ones that just don't work. I may watch Infinity War on TV at some point down the road...maybe when I'm home sick or something..."
" Civil War - Love the premise but the execution leaves me unsatisfied
",-0.5267,0.9847,2018-01-21 00:00:00,4,"I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I've just watched this one, and will admit that I'm no Marvel super-geek, but like everyone else I generally enjoy the tentpole movies. They have been hit and miss, but as they have carried on they have become so same-y, a change was needed. So using the basis of the Mark Millar penned graphic novel ""Civil War""they have created this film. It's different, it's an interesting and for the uber-comic geek, it helps to to play to their fantasy who is the greater/stronger superhero. Yet for all that, I'm feeling dissatisfied. It's a long film watching our 'heroes' on each other's backs, yet the strory was strong enough and nor was the dialogue. Captain America is by far the star of the show, but every other superhero is also shoed in; this really is an Avengers movie without the title and suffers the same problem of overkill in characters.I'm not biasd in DC v Marvel, but both have to step back and re-review what they are producing. This level will see the genre decline, but there is a lot of life in it all.Hoping for better next time. A great premise and top marks for trying to take the genre in a different direction but really put more work into the story. Sometimes less is more."
" Compromise when you can. Where you can't don't.
",0.0,0.4232,2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"More superhero infighting.The reasons are similar to the Batman/Superman thing, vigilante action causing collateral damage irregardless of the fact they are saving the world. The world wants to control the Avengers under a set of protocols. Some agree to them, while others do not and it was opposite from what I expected. Meanwhile there is a bad guy who is not a bad guy sometimes and a friend of Captain America except when he does bad things...so pay attention.I thought the film was about as entertaining as the last one until the end which explodes on the screen with action, humor, and drama.... and we get a non-formula ending.The film also introduces some new Avengers, of which the geeky Tom Holland gets to be Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as Ant Man joins the group in a small role. It is interesting to watch the Avengers battle as there is a lot of talking going on between themselves. The infighting seemed a bit ridiculous and could have been easily avoided, but that film would not be as exciting to watch. Whoever is doing the stunts, my hat is off to them especially Crystal Hooks, Heidi Moneymaker who doubled for Scarlett Johannson. Incredible. No Hulk or Thor or Pepper. Great action film. Iron Man/Stark not as funny and crisp as he was in the past. He was better as a straight man with Spider-Man:Peter Parker: ""I can't go to Germany.""
Tony Stark: ""Why Not?""
Peter Parker: ""I got homework.""What made the whole film unbelievable was the Stark Compound chess board was set up with white square in the left corner and not right.The film is less preachy in its theme. Non-Avenger Lives matter? Don't handcuff the troops? Revenge is a dish best served cold?Minimal PG-13 swearing"

" Another strong Cap film. Bring on the Infinity War!
",-0.2244,0.9806,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Captain America 3' is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time, the film's basically 'Avengers 3', as it features almost every superhero we've seen so far, plus a few new ones. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) continues her close association with Steve/Captain America (Evans) - which worked really well in the last film - but Cap also has Sam/Falcon (Mackie) as his right-hand man too. The premise is quite simple: the ""Sokovia Accords"" (instead of the ""Superhuman Registration Act"" from the 2006 Mark Millar comics the film's based on) are new laws forced on the Avengers by Ross (Hurt), U.S. Secretary of State, as the U.N. wants to see the Avengers held accountable for their actions, since too many people died in (the fake country) Sokovia during the events of 'Avengers 2'. Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.) is all for it, but Cap is not.Bucky/Winter Soldier (Stan) then becomes involved and a massive man-hunt ensues (the film goes to more countries than a Bond film!) and the Avengers are divided (into an even six vs six): Iron Man, Black Widow, Rhodes/War Machine (Cheadle), T'Challa/Black Panther (Boseman), Vision (Bettany) and Peter/Spider-Man (Holland) vs Cap, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Olsen), Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) and Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd). The fight, about two-thirds in with only the Hulk and Thor missing, is epic - definitely something everyone wants to see. Some great quips too (mostly thanks to Ant-Man and Spider-Man - would love to see that team-up film!), as there's no malevolence, just a group of superhero friends/acquaintances fighting for what (and who, as the film's definitely Captain America v Iron Man at it's heart) they think is right.There could still be a little more done with Bucky's backstory - which kind of get mixed in with Iron Man's - but maybe I just need to re-watch 'Captain America 1' again, as it just seems like his & Cap's chemistry isn't quite there. Also needs to explore the Sharon Carter (VanCamp) storyline more. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man is handled superbly, with Spider-Man only getting two scenes, but Holland nails them - the new Spider-Man films will be in good hands. And Boseman as Black Panther is fantastic, full of poise and just the right amount of anger - plus great fighting skills. Can't wait for his film in a few years.I thought it was better than 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', but not quite as good as 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. The ending probably dragged out a little and didn't quite resolve everything, with Zemo (Bruhl)'s plot not being as interesting as it could've been. Still, some great action, some decent ethical questions and some truly inventive fight scenes."
" Cool spectacle
",0.3182,0.6757,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"So many superheroes, so little time. The cast, as always, is great. The story is heavy with conflict. Its a solid Marvel film. The fight scenes are spectacles. If there are too many superheroes fighting, it's a tad difficult to focus. There were so many moments of action- a lot of plot to cover in 2.5 hours, but it's a solid good Cap and Iron Man film."
" A truly Marvouls movie in which stakes between heroes have never been higher.
",0.7351,-0.9962,2017-12-29 00:00:00,10,"CIVIL WAR might be the third CA movie. But most people say its Avengers 2.5. And I can see why they say that. But in the core it is still a Captain America movie. It is essentially the aftermath of whole Washington DC mess. 
 
It had character depth and a pretty solid reasonable plot. In Winter Soldier movie we saw what happened to Tony's parents and it was shown in Avengers 2 that Cap is secretly looking for his friend. It's a secret from Tony who has the tech to help find Bucky, because Cap knows what HYDRA made Bucky do to Tony's parents. Cap feels guilty about involving Tony in this. Even Natasha knew about it and she warned Cap repeatedly about ""not pulling on that tread"" , even though she provided info about Winter Soldier. It also hinted in the movie that Winter Soldier and Black Widow might have more history between them than what we've seen so far. Probably some common ""red"" in their ledger?!Also in the beginning of the franchise we saw Tony playing ball with the government, making weapons for the military. But then he finds out where his weapons are going and that the government is more corrupt than he thought. From the second movie he's against government or any authority. Ten minutes in the SHIELD helicarrier he's hacking the computer systems to find out dirty government secrets. In his words, "" an intelligence agency that fears intelligence is not historically cool"" But his own fears of loosing this patched up family he has now makes him create Ultron. Which leads to all the death and destruction in Sokovia. So Tony who actively hated any authority at first realized that he should not be the boss of him. His whole character ark in the MCU movies is him learning to be responsible and accountable. But is it fair to think that other heroes should also be governed?!Cap also was ready to play ball with the government at first. Well, back in the World War 2 period. But war in those days was more black and white than it is today. Allies were good guys , Nazis were bad guys. Cap was ready to fall back in to the system and get in with the program in the 21st century. But he realized up close and personal that rules are very different in the modern times. After the whole ""CAWS: HYDRA existing as a parasite inside SHIELD"" mess, it's only natural that Cap is stamping Illuminati and conspiracy theory over every questionable government Act he sees. Hell, i would do the same if it happen me.And then you have Bucky who is the true victim of this whole mess. Bucky probably has the best character ark of all of MCU characters. In 3 CA movies he went from superhero sidekick to a super villain\ victim to a something in between in Civil War. There were hints all over the film that his story is not over. He'll get his redemption story in next Avengers movie. Did you see how hard he was trying to protect his backpack. He even has a belt that goes over his chest to protect it. It was mentioned somewhere that it only had those notebooks in it. Books where he's writing what he remembers from his previous life. His story is so tragic and we've seen its Greek tragedy unfold on camera through 3 movies. So it's personal to viewers as well. It's not a tragic character that we need to force ourselves to pity in the span of 2 hours movie. We already went to the film hall not wanting more pain for this character. So every jab, hit and misplaced hatred towards him are stabs to the viewers heart. Can we blame a soldier who sacrificed his life in the name of his country, who is probably the longest surviving prisoner of war, for the crimes he committed while being mercilessly tortured mind controlled? Can we blame the gun for the crimes of the person who was firing it? That moral dilemma is what runs this movie as well as consequences collateral damage. Who is accountable for the damage caused by fights between enhanced beings? Does the cons of having superheros fighing to save people out weight their pros? But can we trust the control of Avengers with the world governments? What if the government wants to send them to a place they don't want to go? What if there is a crazy super-villain holding kids hostage in a school in some hostile country like North Korea or Iran and the accords forbid Avengers from interfering because of some inter government set of rules? This duality in every aspect of the movie is what makes it amazing. The viewers are truly torn between these concepts. I went to the film hall thinking I'm #TeamCap as any sane millennial but I was pushed in different directions throughout the movie. I found myself questioning my allegiance many times. There where places I was thinking Iron Man is right too. I never expected this kind of an effect from a Superhero movie. Zemo knows what he is doing is wrong. He is not one dimensional cardboard enemy who's making trouble for the heroes with world domination in mind. He is blinded by his personal fury and need for vengeance. And he'd stop at nothing to get it. Sorry for the long rant. But I had to point out how careful shared universe building of many years and great attention to detail has made this movie marvelous. It's a masterpiece that that we can one day say to our grand kids that we were lucky enough to watch on big screen while it was first airing."
" Captain America Survivor Series: leave your brain at the door, you won't be needing it
",0.3182,0.9898,2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie's entire marketing campaign is exactly the same as WWE's Survivor Series, asking the viewers if they're #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan. How about #TeamNeither? Well the movie doesn't disappoint if you were expecting WWE with superheroes. This movie was a massive insult to my intelligence. It was one big contradiction after another that I was enraged by the end.You remember how HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD and the government in the last Captain America movie? Seems like it would've been an easy setup for Civil War amongst the heroes right? Well the writers don't remember this because absolutely zero of HYDRA infiltrating things was mentioned in this movie. Instead the film wants us to think the Avengers are now reckless heroes who killed mass amounts of casualties in their battles in the previous films despite there being no prior hints this was the case. If you can believe this massive contradction that was never addressed before, this is what motivates the United Nation to force superheroes to register as government employees. Two things here: 1) Aren't the Avengers already government employees? They work for SHIELD which is the government. And have a military headquarters which also comes off as government. 2) The United Nations were the same people who fired a nuke at NYC during the alien invasion in Avengers 1! That was somehow better than what the Avengers did? There's some more idiocy in this one scene, but I won't get too detailed into it because the movie forgets about this plot point by next scene. I kid you not. As you probably seen in the commercials, the Avengers are back to destroying things like airports by the halfway mark.The rest of the movie consist of chasing Winter Soldier which is the prime motivator to get the characters to go all WWE on each other. Anyone remember Electro from Amazing Spiderman 2? Remember how his character went from a Spiderman fan to his enemy without any real reason? Well I hope you enjoyed Electro's character development (or lack of) because pretty much everyone in this movie is going to do the same thing. Hawkeye last we saw him just wanted to retire with his family. Well here he's betraying his former friends and risk losing his family to help a wanted assassin because screw reasons. This is made worse how the film even brings up the people he's fightng are his best friends. Ant Man is now mysteriously best friends with Falcon and Falcon even has him on speed dial despite they're only meeting was their fight when Paul Rudd was trying to break into Avengers HQ and Falcon was trying to arrest him. Did Ant Man became good friends with all the henchmen he beat up in his solo film too? Rudd was trying to show his family he's a changed man and reconnect with his daughter. So what does he think is a good way to show that? Betray the government fight the Avengers, help a wanted assassin and risk being thrown in jail which *spoilers* he does get thrown in jail. Why did he do all of that? Your guess is as good as mine. Scarlet Witch is established to have Vision taking care of her in this movie, and flips sides shortly after. Wdoes she all of a sudden attack her caretaker to help Steve's cause? She's an idiot I guess. Yes these are the ""reasons"" the film gives us for this ""civil war"".Believe it or not, this film actually has a ""villain"" that most people including myself forgot even existed until others brought him up. Yes he's that insignificant to the film outside being the one initiating all the problems with Winter Soldier. He's typical forgettable villain trying to kill the heroes, except here he wants the heroes to fight each other instead. You want to know what his plan is?
Get resources to build up army then find new super soldier serum formula to power up army.Find codes to Winter Soldier so he's effectively part of your team.Kill the dad of a non Avenger and frame it on Winter Soldier so non Avenger can kill Winter Soldier.Seize every opportunity to have the heroes try and kill Winter Soldier if non Avengers fails.Kill new super soldier army while they're frozen.Initiate fight between Captain America and Iron Man by revealing Winter Soldier killed Tony's mom. This step not only requires for only these three to be in a room together, but for his previous steps to have failed.Kill himself.???ProfitsYes people this is what actually happened in the movie. Everything I said is meant to be taken seriously and not a farce or parody. This movie really has a thing for taking anything resembling continuity and logical sense, bringing into the back and shooting it. Other memorable parts of this idiot train is the ""villain"" great plan to initiate another Winter Soldier fight while he's in captivity in the good guy's HQ, Iron Man refusing the follow Winter Soldier's lead to capture the ""villain"" which is what caused the whole airport fight to now deciding to follow Bucky's lead BY THE NEXT SCENE! Apparently his change of heart was caused by Tony being mortified that when heroes get arrested, they go to jail. As well as Black Panther going Electro after spending the movie refusing to believe that Bucky didn't kill his father, and the most laughable of them all, the film actually tries to make you believe the heroes fractured because of the ""villain's"" moronic plan. No they fractured because the heroes in this franchise can't stop beating each other up, and this time a number of them thought it was a great idea to help a wanted assassin along the way for no reason. And that could've easily been prevented if the other heroes just followed Bucky's lead at first instead of deciding to follow his lead the next scene later after they already destroyed an airport. This film emphasizes what's wrong with the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. These films main priorities evidently is to have as much shameless fight scenes as possible and to bait for upcoming characters whose payoffs are just going to be more WWE fight scenes. And the filmmakers will do anything to achieve these fight scenes regardless how much it butchers story development, character development, continuity and anything resembling logical sense. It's harder to name a MCU movie with more than one hero where the heroes are actually getting along from beginning to end rather than a MCU movie with more than one hero where they can't stop wanting to beat each other up because that's all the MCU seems to care about. Anyone who tells you this movie is ""emotionally deep"", ""thought provoking"", ""morally complex"" and anything that tries to make this movie sound beyond a WWE match is lying to you. Any message this film could've had will get trampled all over it and thrown it into a wood chipper sooner or later as the film progresses. This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in 2016 and possibly the worst MCU movie so far, though I'm sure Marvel Studios will make me eat my words later on."
" Cool action that did not make enough sense
",0.3182,-0.6968,2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"I complained that last year's Avengers movie felt burdened by the many subplots, characters and cliches. This ""super"" story was more focused, even though the whole gang showed up. It was about friendship and consequences. That works. Unfortunately, the two characters that most forced action (Stark and the villain) stopped making rational decisions eventually...also, when Spidey went away, so did the humor. So it was really good, but not great."
" Is as good as the trailers suggest
",0.4404,0.7906,2017-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Perhaps the best Marvel film.
Cap and Tony both make you feel for their cause."
" A Good Movie but a Terrible Adaptation
",-0.4939,0.9958,2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"In the most daring adaptation of a graphic novel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) so far, the Russo Brothers try to bring one of the biggest events of the Marvel comic universe to the big screen but, besides being a relatively good movie, it stands way too far from being a good adaptation.
The original story has 7 official editions named ""Civil War"". Additionally, a lot of simultaneous comics were written about specific characters/groups and their participation/whereabout in the Civil War events, summing up to more than a 100 editions attached to the saga. 
One of the biggest differences between the original and the adaptation is the number of participants. While in the comics universe there were more than 100 superheroes and villains involved, there were about 13 heroes and a really unfaithfully adapted villain, Helmut Zemo, who was represented as a normal soldier with a simple plot and motive. 
Another big difference is the number of big fights between the heroes. While there are a lot of instances in the graphic novel, there is only one conflict in the movie version - in which nothing is settled, by the way. Another major difference is that, in the original, characters die, including really important ones. Some of the events prior to the conflict are different too, as well as some of the characters in the movie who didn't participate in the graphic novel, such as Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man.
Apart from poetic license (such Hank Pym being an old Michael Douglas in the movies and not being Gigantic Man) and legal reasons (e.g. X-Men and Fantastic Four rights not belonging Marvel) which also contributed to the minimized version of the story and the differences mentioned earlier, what can be emphasized as problems in the adaptation?
By far the biggest problem, which compromises the faithfulness of the adaptation, is the lack of fairness in the character's motivations, that is, the obvious bias for Captain America's side (hence the title: CAPTAIN AMERICA - Civil War). I mean, in the graphic novel, both sides have a really strong argument, with a lot of motives and reasoning to it. Meanwhile, in the movie version, it is clear for the audience from the very beginning that Roger's side will win, while Stark represents a B-villain. While Roger's motives are similar to the comics, Tony's are a whole lot different, being, in the movie, emotionally-driven, instead of logically, politically and rationally-driven like in the comics.
In addition to all this, there are the facts of Bucky's participation in the novel being close to none, while Spiderman's being of HUGE importance, as the pivot of the conflict and later changing his allegiance, aspects which were also wildly changed in the adaptation. Lastly, the kickstarter for the accords in the movie is the Sokovia incident, in which Stark created Ultron and ended up with a huge catastrophe. However, in the graphic novel, it was for a whole different event, the explosion of a block, including an elementary school, by Nitro (Captain Marvel's villain) when the New Warriors, a group of inexperienced superheroes, tried to catch Nitro (and other villains who were in a hideout) for a reality television show.
There are so many differences between the original work and the cinematic adaptation, but I tried to sum the most critical ones.
Being one of the most economically successful blockbusters in the MCU, it is really impeccably made, in every technical aspect: production, directing, acting, etc.
I think one of the things worth mentioning in this part is that the co-directors, the Russo Brothers, are well-known for their more action-driven movies (as you can clearly see in Captain America - Winter Soldier, which is more of an action/secret service movie than a superhero one, hence the lack of super abilities for the most part of it). This explains why the movie is more interested in having visual-appealing action scenes than a thought-driven plot.
Although the plot is a little shallow and the whole movie in a way is a means to an end, as expected for the MCU, the movie works well on its own, with a beautiful production and some good action setpieces and average dialogue - besides the unnecessary unfunny out-of-place lines.
It is really important to mention that the Russo Brothers were given an impossible task: to adapt one of the most important and beloved storylines in Marvel's universe and they manage to execute it quite well, given their limitations. Not only they do not own all Marvel's characters' cinematic rights, they also had to deal with what they currently had in the MCU, having no participation in prior movies beside Captain America's ones. That being said, I don't think the directors should take any blame for any complain whatsoever about the lack of faithfulness in the adaptation, they did what they could and it was a good movie nonetheless. Regardless, being a fan of the universe myself, I stand disappointed and hopeless for a more faithful adaptation in the future"
" The perfect example of a good superheroes movie

That nonsense and the poor argument's line make the title absolute rubbish.If I rate it with a three is due to the Tony Stark, Peter Parker and May scene; a good comedy portion with three charismatic characters."
" A mad tour-de-force.
",-0.4939,0.9905,2017-11-27 00:00:00,6,"This is a quite an intense superhero movie, where a UN interference attempting to rein in the Avengers' unlimited powers ends up pitting them against one another, with Iron Man going along with the UN and Captain America going against. Caught in the middle is the Winter Soldier, who was alleged to be a responsible for a host of crimes, but contends that he only committed them because he was brainwashed by Hydra.This movie takes off almost immediately, with action and suspense leading to the two opposing teams of superheroes quarreling with one another. Differing from past Marvel films, the plot does not rely too heavily on crazy CGI and explosive action; rather, it highlights the intrigue and tension between Captain American and Iron Man, along with those on their respective groups, and the unpredictable consequences it leads to.The introduction of Spider-Man in movie was a great treat (Tom Holland did a nice job in portraying the enthusiastic superhero), and the incorporation of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) just adds on to the fun. It is a tour-de-force seeing so many of the Marvel characters all in one movie, duking it out with each other in spectacular special effects fashion.***spoiler ahead*** It's too bad, though, that the film was rather anti-climatic, leaving much loose threads toward the end. ***spoiler ends*** And, with so many Marvel characters featured, the movie could have used a bit more screen time for them, especially Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Too much emphasis was placed in Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Iron Man in the latter half of the movie. I thought there was also a little too much drama placed on the characters trying to explain their position as to why they support or not support the UN accords.Grade C"

OMG. Really?! Come on Mavel you could do better than that. Find a bad guy who spends so much effort in tearing them apart because he is genuinely BAD not over a petty, impersonal accident that happened to him (and thousands of other segovians!). Like Blah.

" Marvel have done it again!
",0.4753,0.9759,2017-09-28 00:00:00,9,"Marvel have gone and done it again, they have managed to produce yet another amazing film, it had everything it needed in it, the action, the humour, the feel, the Stan Lee cameo that appears in every Marvel film without fail. Captain America: Civil War is essentially the current culmination of what has happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). However, within the film as it has been made clear from the posters and various other advertising campaigns as well as the trailer itself it is not only Captain America and Iron Man going one on one with each other as we have already had a taste of that. Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films as the audience can invest and personally choose what side they are routing for as they feel every hit and feel like they're triumphing at every counter attack, for these heroes on an emotional level, which is what the MCU has done with all of the involved characters whether it be their own scenes in films or they actually have their own film. Throughout all of the Marvel films from beginning to now it is clear to see how the hero's have evolved as superhero's as well as general citizens. The histories of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are central to the story that develops in Civil War, and the events that ensue creates the division within the Avengers."

" A Solid, Exciting Adaptation of Marvel's Civil War
",-0.0258,0.9991,2017-09-10 00:00:00,8,"Comic book superhero movies have been blowing up theaters for almost twenty years now. Marvel has been reigning champion for more than half that time, and DC has stepped up their game with their opening moves toward building a cinematic universe. What I'm saying is we've seen a lot of costumed heroes beating up on supervillains and foiling their plots at world domination/destruction/etc. at this point. To keep things fresh, the studios have to find ways to change it up and 2016 saw not one but two different films focused on superheroes turning their fists on their brethren (well, three if you include X-MEN: APOCALYPSE where Storm was temporarily on the villain's team). While Batman's battle with Superman failed to be the explosive intro to Warner's eventual JUSTICE LEAGUE they might've hoped it be (especially critically), the civil war in Marvel's cinematic universe went to show that you could put cram all of your existing superhero roster into a film, go so far as to introduce a few more new characters, give them all a reason to brawl, and still come out with box office gold. CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is Marvel's most ambitious film to date and had every reason to fall apart, but the team behind the camera managed to put together one of the best entries in the studio's canon. It manages to avoid the increasingly cliché superhero storytelling tropes and also shakes up the inter-character dynamics amongst the dozen or so heroes we've come to know.Civil War is the only run of comics I've made a point to read in its entirety. I read all of the core issues as well as all of the individual hero runs that went alongside it. Needless to say, I was beyond excited at the announcement that Marvel Studios would be tackling the story arc for the third film in the Captain America series, but I was also worried because there was just so much that happened in the comics that I feared a version boiled down to two or so hours wouldn't do it justice. In the end, having seen the finished product, I love it. It doesn't hold up as well under multiple viewings. On my first viewing, I thought it the best Captain America film and one of the top Marvel films period. Since then, I've come to accept that I was a bit blown away by the spectacle (that airport battle!) and I've adjusted my opinions and recognize that, while it's most certainly awesome, there are still better Marvel films. I have had some regrets with the film though. In the comics, it goes a little darker at the midpoint when the heroes on both sides realize the consequences of their actions (the movie pulls it's punches and there are no tragic long-term consequences of their in-fighting) and I still sort of wish they'd kept the original dramatic end from the comics (you know the onewith Captain America) because of the impact it would've left.I understand their reasons for the changes from comic to screen (can't shake up the status quo in this money machine too much) but I would've really appreciated the studio showing it was willing to make a drastic change for dramatic impact in service of the series. Instead, injuries will heal and, while there's still a rift in our Avengers by the end of the film, we know they'll reconcile when it comes time to fight Thanos in INFINITY WAR. So, in the long run, their squabbles don't mean much but they do make for a great movie. And we got to meet some new characters! CIVIL WAR introduces us to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Boseman gives a strong performance as T'Challa/Black Panther but isn't given a whole lot to do other than brood and chase vengeance; regardless, there's the seed of a great new hero for the cinematic universe and it's increased my interest for his upcoming standalone. Spider-Man, on the other hand, was the big draw for me. I know I wasn't alone in my excitement for his arrival in the MCU after the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise fell to pieces. Tom Holland is pitch perfect as the web-slinger and the filmmakers have captured the spirit of the character better than both Sam Rami and Marc Webb ever managed. It's no surprise that Marvel themselves would be the ones to do the character justice, even if it's only for an extended cameo in the middle of the film.Despite all the superhero-on-superhero violence and new hero introductions, this is still a Captain America film and the main through-line still focuses on Captain America and the Winter Soldier. It somewhat continues from WINTER SOLDIER in that Bucky Barnes is still a wanted international criminal, though he's recovered enough of his memories that he isn't a threat, and Steve Rogers still has his back. The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing a meeting of the United Nations and Captain America goes rogue to clear his name; meanwhile, a botched Avengers mission in Africa ends with civilian deaths and the United Nations moves to pass the Sokovia Accords, a program that would require government registration of all vigilante heroes. It's Rogers' willingness to disobey the Accords in an effort to clear Barnes' name that leads to the dispute between him and Tony Stark/Iron Man, whose guilty conscience leads him to give his full support to the Accords. So the spectacle and abundance of heroes are great, but this is still a Cap story at heart and CIVIL WAR is another home run from the Russo brothers, in what originally started as my least anticipated Marvel film franchise but has since become one of its strongest."

" It may be a bit overrated but....GREAT
",0.0,0.9795,2017-08-30 00:00:00,8,"ALRIGHT NOW. People, where do I start. I'll give you the GOOD, BAD, and then the VERDICT.GOOD:This movie does a very good job with it's action. Each action sequence is outstanding and it feels somewhat real in a way. I know for a fact the AIRPORT SEQUENCE was a big highlight of the film and I consider it to be one of the best comic book fights on the big screen. But one other scene that grabbed my attention was the one when Bucky attempts to escape from Captain America, the Police, and Black Panther. That scene was just amazing how a fight can transfer from a small apartment to a big chase in a underground highway and some of the stunts were practical which makes it that much better. Character interaction and development works really well, the actors do a good job delivering their lines. What I really like about some of the humorous lines in this film is it feels so organic (not forced at all), I can honestly say the last MCU film that had humor organically was Iron Man 1 and somewhat Avengers 1. Introducing Spider-Man into this film was a great choice from Marvel if you asked me. A lot of reviews I've read said that ""Spider-Man and Antman didn't have to be in this film. If they weren't in here, the results of the film would have been the same."" I will say they are absolutely right, but they made it work really well including them in the film.BAD: 2 MAJOR THINGS.1. Zemo's Plan: I will admit that Zemo's plan has some flaws to it. For example: How did he know how some of characters were going to act. How did he know that Iron Man was going to show up at the facility near the end of the film with Captain America and Bucky (stuff like that). But let me cut some slack with the character Zemo for a second. One thing that some of the audience kind of forgot about Zemo is he's not your ordinary type of guy. Near the end of the film they explain that he is a master tactician for the Sokovian unit called EKO Scorpion. So that shows that he might have some intelligence on psychology, but it's still a bit of a flaw because they didn't confirm it.2. No Death: In my opinion, I really think what could have made this movie a tad bit better is if there was a death in the team, specifically James Rhodes/War Machine. Think about it, if Rhodes were to die that would add more tension between the teams and it would make the build up towards the final battle between Captain America and Bucky vs Iron Man even more emotional adding it with the death of Tony's parents.VERDICT: Despite all the people that take the nit picky stuff of this film and make it into a big flaw. Critics can say all they want that this film is overrated, but I thought the film is great.I would have to give this film a 8/10 or at least a 7.9/10"

This is not only the worst superhero movie I've seen, but contextually the most infuriating cultural artifact I've ever consumed, including Fantastic '94 and that time my fast food dinner had weevils. It's the Sonic '06 of motion pictures, and the Plan 9 of political discourse. I'm in the middle of a 3+ part comic series reviewing this movie ( https://porkcow.deviantart.com/art/Ambrosia-1-673666877 ). But in summary, it so far removes the characters from not only what they are in the film series that this movie killed (not financially, but for actual MCU fans), but eradicates every single basic idea that these icons represent. Tony stark, across all movies, is a libertarian who would rather legalize doomsday devices than stoop to the terrors of fascism. Captain America is a soldier who has only once in his career gone over his superior's head to serve his country, and is as afraid of vigilantes and terrorists as the nation he serves. In this ""movie"" however, they switch brains and lose any trace of personality or ration they had. The ""film"" also has visuals, music and dialogue that are not only bland and brainless, but further defeat any identity that this vast ensemble of characters have. They're all the same blandly-scored, brightly lit liberal airhead with nothing better to do than go against their own self interest and life-long creed. Not even the children were spared. Batman vs Superman: a bit too commercial, and Doomsday was Lex Luther's son for some reason. But Batman was Batman, Superman was Superman, and the music, story, and visuals oozed personalty at every turn. Superman II: one of the worst movies in the genre, and the plot was a mess, but at least Superman was Superman and the movie looked and felt like a Superman thing. This: Scriptwriter Christopher Markus needs to understand making several decent movies doesn't exonerate his name from this atrocity. In the words of my favorite Superhero ""Though my detest for you as a human being is Brobdingnagian, I can assure you what I'm about to do is nothing personal"". Aside from Netflix offerings, I'm quitting Marvel. Apologize, retire, and take McFeely with you. Bon voyage."

There was a surprising amount of depth and emotion to the movie with exploring Steve Rogers' conflict with the title of Captain America and his complex relationship with Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark.

This movie in terms of story adds nothing relevant in the grand scheme of the Marvel universe, the plot is full of holes and it is noticeable that it was made just to grab some more quick cash, although there are people who think this is a work of art when you notice that not even the actors put a minimum amount of effort in their work and we all know why: stupid story to promote the negative feelings of hate and revenge using our favorite heroes against each other. Listen what I tell you and skip this one. I rate it 3/10 only because of nice fx and costumes."

Just like ""Logan"", it went by the name ONLY. The fact that they were fighting was there. Wow! A fight! I guess that's their idea of following the original story.In the original story, a group of wannabe super heroes accidentally caused an explosion that killed more than 900 people, including children, and THAT'S what lead to the debate about there being a registry. The fake Thor wasn't in it (he kills Goliath), Spiderman doesn't take off his mask at a press conference to reveal to the world who he is in an attempt to show that he is cooperating with the registry. NOTHING!Nope! Lets just Micheal Bay everybody and give them explosions, fights, and special effects. They'll shut up.Trash....just plain trash!"

",0.0,0.9872,2017-08-13 00:00:00,4,Yeah I admit MCU made so good films like Iron Man (2008) but this film is not good. It's boring like I'm starting to watch BatMan v SuperMan (2016) and it's better (not a DC fanboy) so what it's a bit longer at least BatMan appear way sooner than Spider-Man in the film. Just cause it's label 'MCU' It doesn't mean it's going to be good. I hate when in films they talk very softly some of the time like I see Hulk (2003) talk louder than that. At least we get to see Spider- Man in the film even though HE'S IN TWO SCENES INCLUDING THE POST CREDIT!! At least Tom Holland is better than Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man.

The film is overrated, in my opinion. The only reason people praise it so much is for the characters that appeared in the film finally coming together....oh wait....on one screen. The actors are amazing as usual. When I left the theater, I was reminded of Batman v Superman. I compared both films in quality, and Batman v Superman won. I even rated BvS 9 out of 10 over this film's 7/10. Once again, this film is overrated. Let's hope Infinity War is a Winter Soldier and not a Civil War."
" Family squabble
",0.0,-0.822,2017-08-10 00:00:00,1,Captain America: Civil War is the most overrated film I have ever seen. I will outline in bullet points.Plot devices posing as character. The most obvious of these being Daniel Bruhl's Zemo who seems to be at the right place at the right time to move the plot along. There was also the woman who blamed Tony Stark for her son's death who was never mentioned or seen after that scene.The airport fight. This is mostly played for laughs. Sometimes I thought I was watching a super powered take of an Anchorman fight but then that's what you get when you cast Paul Rudd. When it tries to be serious you are taken out completely.Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Sorry I found him to be incredibly annoying that I have not watched his solo film because of him. I hope he has a lesser role in Avengers: Infinity War.Only for die hard Marvel fans.
" I really liked this movie!
",0.5244,0.9361,2017-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, you need to know that I'm a fan of Marvel, because they have unique characters and what I like the most is, that all meet each other in the end. Some earlier, some later. So they created a whole new universe which is incredible. Although they started mixing heroes together with the Avengers movies, they continued here with putting for example Ant-Man, Spiderman and the new hero Black Panther in. But now to the movie itself: I'm also a fan of dramatically scenes and obviously the movie had a lot in it and I'm #TeamIronMan, because Stark's kinda right about the whole situation and tried to get the best for the team and Cap shouldn't have that over reacted, but that's just my opinion. I also loved Starks Suit, it was really well done by the special effects team. I wished, he'd had this suit in Spiderman Homecoming or Infinity War, but unfortunately it got destroyed by Cap. Also the story line is really good in my opinion and it makes it even more interesting to see Infinity War, because they need to re-unite first before they can defeat Thanos."
" Rating: A
",0.0,0.9955,2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"The Captain America series is, by far, my favorite: the first movie did really well in introducing this new hero and Captain America: Winter Soldier is considered by many the best Marvel movie so far because of its realism and a more serious path that they took this character into. This film follows that path, but this time, it brings ALL of the superheroes down to Earth and makes them feel responsible for what they've done.I was concerned with the fact that they had so many characters because they needed to give reason to all of them to choose a side and I wasn't sure that they would be able to do it well ... However, they did! I was surprised with how serious, realistic and mature this movie was (along with all the usual moments of comedy we're used to). There was time for each character to have their own reasons to join either Captain America / Steve Rogers's team or Iron Man / Tony Stark's team and that made the movie so much more grounded, with real life consequences. It was a movie way beyond that ass-kicking fight scenes that most people remember and care about, it had real emotions and purpose, with all the friendship's colliding and a revenge path that didn't go well.Now, this film is not perfect, there are minor issues here and there, but no one, anyone, can criticize the action present in this movie. The stunt team did a perfect, awesome job! There were some amazing choreographed fight scenes, most of it in-camera with no CGI, there were a lot of chase scenes and one-on-one combats that felt so incredibly real. Of course, they used CGI on explosions and all that stuff, but they really improved all of the stunt work done in previous films.So, I have to talk about some actors and their characters: Tom Holland as Spider-Man / Peter Parker was my main worry after what I saw in that last trailer ... But Jesus, he was great! This is probably the best Spider-Man I've ever seen, the writing for him was perfect and the place where he came from was so humbly real and well-adjusted to this character. Chadwich Boseman as Black Panther / T'Challa was bad-ass, I loved every scene he was in! Again, the directors gave him enough time for us to understand his motives and to why did he choose a side to fight for. After they tell his backstory, I was totally on his side, as I was for every single character!The reason why that big airport battle was so awesome is because I cared for everyone that was there and that made every combat so entertaining to watch. Everyone, even the villain, had his own motivations and the film was so clear to demonstrate that, no one was there just because they needed to be since this was a big superhero clash. Also, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man / Scott Lang proved once again that he's pure awesomeness. Just saying.This film handled the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man so well on all levels (physical, mental, political) that, at the beginning of the fight, I couldn't choose a side. All of that #TeamCap and #TeamIronMan campaign was just marketing because when you actually see the movie, you are behind every superhero's cause because you understand their motivations.The ending didn't go as I wanted to, but I can't fault the movie for it, at least not yet. Also, Daniel Bruhl as Zemo could have done a lot better. It seemed he was there just to help the movie get from here to there and he wasn't very interesting, he even got boring at one point. The first 20/30 minutes are also very different from the rest of the film, the editing was not that great in major action scenes and it did bother me a little.Still, I really think that the Captain America series is the best from Marvel so far. It's the only one where each movie got better than the last one and I can't say the same for the other series (Thor, Iron Man, The Avengers ...).MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Royal Superhero Rumble!!!
",0.0,0.6226,2017-08-04 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)Since when did Captain America movies become a movie where most every superhero makes a substantial appearance. Maybe I don't watch enough of this genre but Captain America barely felt like the main character. Anyway, the movie was mainly about should superhero's be able to fight crime as they chose without consequences or should they be forced to follow some rule of law under governmental supervision. With my lack of expertise, for some reason half of the them were OK following rules and half were anti that measure. Valid points being made that in this movie (and past ones) many humans have been injured while the heroes fight the villains and the heroes skate free. It also appeared that a new superhero Spider'boy' was launched here? Anyway, the fun and fluffy mega action Royal Rumble felt odd as many of the superheroes are friends so they aren't going to fight to the death so I didn't understand the goal of the rumble. At least the rumble clearly showcased each hero's superpowers during the battle rather than a visual mess that are the Transformers action scenes (I'm talking to you Michael Bay). It was an OK and lightly entertaining moviesprobably a better script would have helped; case in point being that during a short stretch they let loose on the comedy which wasn't there before or after (aka: unbalanced tone) aside from some amusing Downey Jr. quipshe's always good in this genre."

Oh we're not done yet we get a taste of our friendly...you know the rest. The kid is awesome! Culminate treachery and having to chose sides they should have come out with a second part, no Thanos or other worldly intervention just the crew going at it! Lots of fun action and new characters!

",0.6792,0.9822,2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"After the debacle of Avengers Age of Ultron, the Marvel Studios have done a brilliant thing by pitting the Avengers vs each other. Thanks to excellent writing and in the good hands of the Russo brothers, we get an all out entertaining films and one of the best from the Marvel studios.Civil War is not your usual superhero film where there is a bad guy and the heroes teaming up to stop him. Civil War is different because its a clash of ideologies and beliefs. And thats what makes the film work.Its great to see Captain America being pitted against Iron Man and the fact that they become opposites of what they are known for. Captain America who is the principled one doesn't want any laws or council stopping him from preventing terror while Iron Man known always know for breaking rules wants to live by them.The movie also captures how a simple man can bring a crack between the superheroes and instead of uniting, they fight to stop each other. Its also highlights the importance for fighting for your friends and being with them no matter what the odds are. The movie is high on emotional quotient with a lovely climax and there is no right or wrong one.The performances are top notch and each actor gives his best. Special mention to Paul Rudd and Tom Holland for their cameos as Ant Man and Spider Man. They bring the much required comedy in otherwise a serious film.Go watch it whether you love the superheroes or not because this film will not disappoint you a bit."
" One of the best, if not the best MCU movie so far
",0.8555,0.7814,2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best, if not the best MCU movie to date. The Russos and the writers managed to blend in the actions, mystery, emotions, and of course, the quips. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is an appropriate finale for the ever-improving Captain America trilogy. While it doesn't break new grounds in the genre (""The Dark Knight trilogy"" and 2012's ""The Avengers"" have that honor), it certainly did enough to offer something new to the audience (In a much better way then the other Superhero vs Superhero flick earlier that year).While some people think that the villain is weak and boring, I think it's one of the smartest villains in MCU. While a great many people see this is an Avengers movie, there are some (including me) would still see this as a Cap movie. The Civil War event and the other Avengers are build around the Cap/Buck story arch, a continuation of ""The Winter Soldier"". Yes, this is a busy movie (Also the longest in the MCU), but it doesn't feel that long and/or boring, thanks to the lighthearted momentsAs far as box office go, this was the box office king of 2016 (Internationally, not just North American Box Office), and deservedly so"
" The Most Ambitious Yet Grandest Film of the Year (So Far)
",0.7939,0.9704,2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Review Summary: ➕ Spider-Man ➕ Black Panther ➕ Team Captain America vs. Team Iron Man ➕ Airport Battle SceneThe movie is indeed one of the grandest and most ambitious films ever made surpassing the grandeur and power of its predecessors. To say that any of the Avengers or Iron Man films is better than this film is an understatement to the third act of Captain America. In Captain America: Civil War, we see Team Captain America fight against Team Iron Man after a supposed protocol was to be imposed by the United Nations on the Avengers as innocent lives were sacrificed in previous missions by the mightiest heroes in the land specifically those missions done in New York (The Avengers), Washington D.C. (Captain America: Winter Soldier), Sokovia (Avengers: Age of Ultron) and Lagos, Nigeria (beginning of Captain America: Civil War). Captain America fights for the right of superheroes to decide on their own whereas Iron Man fights for the enlistment of the Avengers under the United Nations Sokovia Accords. The ensemble cast has 12 superheroes fighting blood and sweat for what they believe in. The stand-out would definitely be Spider- Man who I would be anticipating very soon. (Spider-Man is my favorite superhero and this movie gave due respect to the titular superhero that the reboot Spider-Man movies failed to do. Thank you Sony for allowing Spider-Man to be part of the Avengers.) The Black Panther and Ant- Man were some of my other favorites to make an appearance. Though there were boring conversational arguments and a very unexciting villain in the movie, the action sequences occurring almost every minute between the different superheroes made such problem forgivable and very deserving of a 10/10. This is the best movie of the 2016 so far. Truly grand in scope and out of this world. Better than X-Men: Apocalypse."
" Cheap copy of BVS
",0.0,-0.9796,2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"I know it may sound a little harsh but the critics decided to bash BVS and showered praises on Civil War when it was altogether the same movie. The only difference being Civil War was stuffed with jokes that personally I do not care about. the movie plot was linear with no depth in the story, a child could predict what would happen and the plot holes are too big to ignore as they do not show how come Zemo had access to all those information that even Iron Man did not have, and the climax was totally depended on chance..... In other words WHY DID'NT ZEMO JUST SEND A MMS TO TONY OF HIS PARENTS BEING MURDERED."
" Meh - your usual CGI-based action and nothing more
",-0.0772,0.8138,2017-07-16 00:00:00,4,"After an unfortunate incident in Africa, the UN decides that the Avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a UN entity control the Avengers. Tony Stark is for this, Captain America against it. When the UN meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked, and several UN representatives killed, it appears to be the work of Winter Soldier. Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can. One such character is Spider Man, who is incredibly irritating. Certainly a reason to skip the Spider Man movie. One for fans of comic book movies only."

I had sat through good movies like Iron Man and Avengers, I sat through mediocre movies like Iron Man 3 and Thor, but this movie is by far my least favorite Captain America and Marvel movies (ignoring Fant4stic Four, Spider Man, and X- Men). I'm going to start with the biggest thing, CA:CW vs BVS. I'm not biased, I like both of their movies. But the thing is I saw CW at home on DVD, and I threw up from the camera shaking for no reason. Steve and Tony are assholes to everyone. And no, there is no ""emotional"" story except parent murder. Steve wants to help a terrorist because is mentally controlled, and Tony feels grief. The CGI is terrible, and I couldn't keep the motives together, so I had to watch Cinema Sins just to recall. The movie has to many characters. Call me biased all you want, but I did not like this movie. But it isn't the worse I've seen, but its saying something when I like BVS more."

" Epic Showdown between Avengers
",0.0,0.8961,2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"After seeing the amazing second Captain America movie, Winter Soldier, I was excited for Cap's third solo movie outing. As always, Marvel didn't disappoint me. Civil War lived up to the hype. It is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's worth the watch for any fan of the MCU.The story line for Civil War was really good. It kept me engaged through out the movie. The problem with the story is it can be confusing for those who don't keep up with all the different MCU movies. Also, some of the story was to set up the Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming movies that haven't been released as of yet. Civil War also felt scaled down compared to the 2006 comic story line. The movie deals with the aftereffects of the Sokovia Incident and another one in Lagos which both events involved the Avengers. These two events divide the Avengers in two groups led by Captain America and Iron Man respectively.It was amazing seeing Spider-Man finally show up in the MCU. Tom Holland nailed it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Glad that Sony and Marvel/Disney made an agreement to share the character. I was disappointed by the last few Spider-Man movies and Marvel fixed my worries with the intro of Spidey. He was one of the highlights of Civil War. Another character introduced to the MCU is Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa/Black Panther. After seeing him in action, I can't wait for the Black Panther movie to come out in February 2018.The rest of the cast gave great performances as well. It was good that the 2008 Hulk movie was acknowledged in the MCU by way of Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross played by William Hurt. Another problem I have with Captain America: Civil War is the villain. Daniel Bruhl's Helmut Zemo wasn't that memorable even though his actions in Civil War has a lasting impact in the MCU. Most of his actions seem like coincidences and good luck on his part. Despite that, I really enjoyed the movie and can't wait to see how the Avengers come together in Infinity War to fight Thanos."
" This is my favourite MCU movie
",0.0,0.9358,2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage. The new status quo deeply divides the members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Falcon (Sam Wilson) must pick a side.This movie is able to push so many characters together into one story. There are so many characters but it still manages to keep a Captain America story. There's a great balance of humor, action and drama! One of the best superhero movie of all time. Loved the movie, all characters were awesome specially Spidey he killed it in that movie and the same thing with Black Panther. Best fights ever! The airport battle was epic and the fight we all been waiting for: Cap vs Iron man."
" I don't understand the hate a descent awesome MCU super action superhero - Captain America is the king
",0.9,0.9994,2017-07-02 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other: Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue ""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!"" Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo. Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10"

This film, ""Captain America Civil War"" is a boring, confusingly plotted, poorly acted and an ending that settled nothing with regards to the Avengers being divided by a law that restricts the movements of the superheroes. There was hardly any continuity between the scenes as the narrative was as flat as a tyre. This film was all about those dreaded CGI and precious little else. The exclusion of the Incredible Hulk and Thor was a considerable mistake. The villain was almost non-descript and wasn't very interesting or menacing. In my opinion, Tony Stark/Iron Man should have been given more screen time and the plot should have revolved more around him. A huge disappointment."

Still it kinda looks like they are out of ideas and playing with characters like toys for your usual summer blockbuster2. It is tragic. I was always with Steve in this movie. Still... the script was written a bit unconvincing...probably because of the Avengers magic...like.... believe it or not - the characters themselves did not want to be in this movie and fight each other. Because they didn't want to be toys for entertainment in the first place. So the perfect Formula of Marvel's - action and deep message - actually didn't work here. The message was too deep on the brink of simply drowning in it and the action was inconsistent.3. The message however was still there - a tragic of a drama of friends fighting each other. On both sides and these both sides are the same and good. Still the thing about this movie is that Marvel actually was not able to decide what part of the Formula -action or the message - they should make a priority. The result - lots of painful dramatic moments and unconvincing action scenes - simply because Avengers are not Batman and Superman - they are a team so they cannot impressively fight each other 'cause they can impressively fight together)"

It even manages to work in a climax that does not involve blue light shining up into the sky and all the heroes fighting hordes of enemies. It's not as good as the previous Captain America film and nowhere near as refreshing as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but it delivers what a film like this should and it does it well."
" The Best Avengers Movie... er, Captain America Movie To Date.
",0.6369,0.9976,2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Just when the Avengers stories were getting stale and very familiar, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely along with directors Anthony and Joe Russo bring us the best Avengers movie to date... except that it isn't since it's Capt's film.Let's get this out of the way, this is loosely based on Mark Millar's opus though it could never reach the depths of characterisation or story in just the two and half hour runtime. Though the story has been pared down to the minimum basics of the original, what we do get is very entertaining. After the disastrous effects of Age Of Ultron the governments of the world are wanting to put a leash on the Avengers and all other heroes. Not all of the heroes are accepting of this arrangement, especially Captain America who goes off on his own.The only thing I would have liked in this film is a deeper look at the psychological effects the Sokovia Sanctions, which are addressed in the graphic novels. This would have made it stronger and more accessible to adults. They could have done this without changing the certification.It was also nice to see the other newbies to the Marvel universe - Ant- Man, The Black Panther, and of course The Amazing Spiderman. It was great seeing Spidey finally mixing it up in the with The Avengers and with the changing eye lenses in his costume and the best and most accurate portrayal yet, from Tom Holland - Awesome. Though I'm not too sure about the upcoming Homecoming movie or the role Stark is to play in Peter Parkers costume. The star of this film though has to be The Black Panther - Chadwick Boseman gives a brilliantly cool portrayal of the hero prince of Wakanda.The rest of the cast give the performances we are used to from the rest of the series.Thanks to the directors, the action is fast and furious, and thanks to Spidey and Ant-Man pretty funny. The effects are superb, as always, and they don't overpower the story or the screen as with previous films - the fight scene on Ultron was too busy and confusing (and too short). The pace is varied and creates a roller-coaster ride of a film which helps keep the emotions of the viewers fluctuating between excitement and the dramatic. This is a well-constructed and crafted movie.For me, this third instalment of the Captain America series is the best; and as I stated at the start it's also the best Avengers movie too. If you've not started watching any of the Marvel Universe films yet then this is one to catch. It works as a stand-alone movie as it references the previous films in a way that you don't need to see them to know what's happening here. In regards to both Captain America and The Avengers, this is the only movie in each of the series which I will watch more than once, it is that enjoyable."
" Review – Captain America: Civil War (2016)
",-0.5994,0.9969,2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"The Russo brothers, who had just mediocre films like 'You, Me and Dupree' and 'Welcome to Collinwood' to their credit, literally shot to the top with the excellent second instalment in Marvel's Captain America series. Also, Joss Whedon set the MCU ensemble bar really high with 'The Avengers' (2012) and 'Age of Ultron' (2015) (with the former being a slightly more entertaining film).Hence, the Russos had a behemoth of a task at hand while making the third instalment in the Cap series, which by the first look and initial story-reveal looked on route to becoming Avengers 2.5. And boy, did they deliver in style. Civil War is hands-down the best ensemble MCU film by far. It is a definite crowd-pleaser by all means, although we missed the likes of Bruce Banner, Thor and Nick Fury.Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writers of Thor 2 and Cap 2, pen a screenplay that strikes a fulfilling balance of action, emotion, comedy, and filled with twists and surprises. Story goes as simple as this: Stark and Rogers are for and against political interference in the activities of the Avengers respectively, and this leads to the team splitting into two, and the events that follow form the core of 'Civil War'.While Marvel crazies already knew of the plot line and had watched several scenes of the film published via YouTube, it was undoubtedly a huge task to match the expectation levels set by the previous films. But the Russos have dethroned all previous entries by handing us Civil War. The way the screenplay tackles the character of Bucky Barnes is certainly one of the many highlights in the film. Sebastian Stan returns to play his meatiest role yet, and sheds more light on his Winter Soldier persona. As seen in Cap 2, the set- pieces in Civil War (both on the ground and in the sky) look remarkably well-shot and choreographed. So many swift cuts coupled with fast-paced action elevates the movie to a different platform altogether. Upper-cuts, blows, kicks and punches are landed neatly and put to good effect. The Leipzig airport set-piece positions itself right on top of the list of the best choreographed action sequences ever made on film. Trent Opaloch's cinematography is reminiscent of his work in District 9, Elysium, Cap 2 and Chappie.Well, it is unquestionably a treat for the senses to watch Team Cap (Rogers, Bucky, Wilson, Barton, Lang and Maximoff) go head-on-head with Team Iron-Man (Stark, Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa and Parker). The propaganda for each character is etched out with utmost subtlety. Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes take the bulk of the screen time and they pull off their acts quite convincingly. Daniel Bruhl's Zemo serves as a great antagonist pulling all the right strings and chooses to spread villainy by making the Avengers go against each other. Chris Evans is incredible as Cap, while Downey shines in a role that requires him to be comparatively subdued (and guilt-ridden).While it is unmistakably Cap's and Iron Man's film, Civil War fleshes out two major additions to the MCU in astounding fashion..T'Challa a.k.a Black Panther & Peter Parker a.k.a Spiderman. Chadwick Boseman does a great job with what he's been handed out and sets the stage for his solo film. Tom Holland appears to be the most promising Spiderman yet, and he gets to show off his skills in that wonderfully executed airport sequence. Also, that scene where Tony Stark goes to meet Parker is effing hilarious. Paul Rudd's Ant Man also made the proceedings a lot wittier and enjoyable. Every character shines in their individual roles, and credit should go to the writers and the directorial duo for giving each superhero an adequate amount of screen time. Except for Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye (who I felt appeared bland and underwritten in this film), all characters leave an impression that is sufficient for the viewer to care for their futures in the upcoming Infinity War films. Stan Lee's cameo towards the end was a nice touch.Marvel looks like they hit the jackpot here, especially with DC's Batman V Superman being a strictly mediocre film and performing way below expectations; they can allow to rest their heads for a bit because the groundwork for the Spiderman / Black Panther solo films as well as the Infinity War sequels have been laid out almost impeccably in Civil War.Oh, and hold on to your seats for the mid-credits as well as post- credits scenes.😉"
" Movie Plot 101
",0.0,-0.9988,2017-06-02 00:00:00,4,"I generally enjoy Marvel movies, in spite of the simple story lines and lack of depth. They are still fun and make for good entertainment. This particular release from Marvel Studios is, however, the pinnacle of a miserably meaningless storyline put on display with the aid of an outrageous budget. I get it, we all wanted to see some big battle with all the Avengers fighting each other, but could they not have come up with a decent plot for it all? I'm getting ahead of myself though. Let me take a step back and explain my thoughts.In Captain America: Civil War, the most readily apparent conflict centers around the ""Hero Registration Act,"" the government's attempt to gain some control over the Avengers. Some of the Avengers are in favor, and some are not. This creates a situation that could have been a nice break from the standard hero's journey rehash that typically constitutes a Marvel movie because neither of the two conflicting sides was in the wrong. Hey, that's kind of interesting. At this point, as I watched the movie, I was feeling optimistic about how it would turn out.Then Bucky Barnes, previously the Winter Soldier and friend of Steve Rogers (Captain America), bombs a U.N. building! Quickly, the whole Hero Registration Act conflict fades into the background and becomes unimportant. Now some of the Avengers are defending Bucky and some are seeking to turn him in. Now that is the main conflict between them. Turns out he didn't actually bomb the building—it was just a mysterious new villain with a flesh mask.Now this mystery man is the apparent antagonist in the story—don't get too excited, we're not going to actually know ANYTHING about this guy until the very end and it's going to turn out he's a nobody who will quickly be disposed of and not cause problems again. Not really a super- villain or anything. As the movie goes on, a lot action and fighting happens, including a huge battle between all the Avengers, though by now I'm not really sure why they're fighting. They just were... yeah.Eventually they figure out that this mystery villain is going to some bunker where there is an army of sleeping super soldiers he can awake and take control of. Okay, now we've got something concrete: an antagonist (though we still have no idea who he is or what is motivations are) causing an actual big problem that needs to be fixed and a set of protagonists to face the problem. It's like the writers finally learned the basics of plot! Protagonist, antagonist, conflict, and now we're building to a climax. The movie's almost over, but oh well.Anyway, they go to this super soldier army only to find that the villain killed all the super soldiers in their sleep so there isn't actually any real threat to anyone. The writers have yet again destroyed their plot. So where are they going with this? We've blown through three ""main"" conflicts, two of which were left unresolved and the last of which immediately resolved itself without any effort on the part of the protagonists. Now we're left with a powerless man who doesn't like the Avengers because while they saved the world in a previous movie, his hometown was destroyed as collateral damage (never mind that it would have been destroyed anyway). But hey, at least that could be a super-villain... except he isn't. He's just a normal guy with some misplaced vengeance, and what on earth is he going to do now that he's sitting powerless before two of the leading avengers (Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, aka Iron Man and Captain America)?This part really gets me. They've had this whole over-complicated buildup with a bunch of action sequences, a huge battle, and droves of overblown drama—all that build up to the pathetic villain showing Tony a video of brainwashed Bucky killing Tony's parents—a video that HE COULD HAVE JUST EMAILED TO HIM. So now we have yet another conflict, this one introduced in the final minutes of the movie. Maybe this could at least be the set up for a future movie? Nope. After a few more minutes of drama and the fighting, the writers even throw in a bit showing a gesture suggesting that Tony Stark got over the whole ""you killed my parents because you were brainwashed"" thing and we are left with a world that is more or less as it was before.None of the plot mattered. The vast majority of the plot didn't even have relevance to a singular main conflict. Basically, I just watched a movie of a bunch of stuff happening. It was all confusing and didn't actually contribute to a real storyline, and ultimately nothing came of it. I haven't felt this disappointed in a plot structure since the TV drama Lost (at least the last few seasons). A twelve-year-old fan fiction writer could have come up with a better story and produced a better film on a fraction of the budget. I'm sorry, but Marvel, the simplistic plot line, outrageous budget blockbuster thing you're trying to do is just not that hard—could you please just put SOME thought into it? I get that you'll make millions no matter what, so you don't really have any reason to care, but I'd appreciate it. I just want something enjoyable. I'm not asking that you actually make something meaningful or with any level of depth, just that you do the bare minimum of half-decent story for me to follow."

This third movie didn't feel the same though, felt more like a TV show or something, I was bored through most of it. The only great things about the movie was spider man and ant man. They made the movie."

It's full of action, adventure humor, superb story-line and has an awesome twist. The best part of this movie is seeing the majority of the Marvel Crime Fighting Heroes kicking ass and ""DUKING IT OUT"" against each other. Reminds me of Super Smash Brothers for Nintendo. SWEEEEEETT!!!!"
" It Should Be Called The Avengers: Civil War, Not Captain America
",-0.5994,0.9521,2017-05-24 00:00:00,7,"This was the year (2016) of superheroes fighting themselves. The first half of the movie was slow it start to pick up around the middle of the story. The story lines remind me of DC Animated Movies and Justice League Unlimited first season. Three Marvel characters that do not appear in this one were Thor, Hulk, and Nick Fury which that surprising. They treating Tony Stark like he's the bad guy in this but he doing his job and all Cap (meaning Captain America) is doing's protect his friend Bucky now Winter Soldier. Who really steals the show is Tom Holland's Spider-Man (first actual teenager playing him) in his appearance he just as fun as Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man. The film is okay, but I like said the begin was mediocre but still entertain."
" The Cap sends out all the wrong messages in this mess of a movie
",-0.7162,-0.9631,2017-05-23 00:00:00,5,"Tell me, why do people hate Spider-man 3 so much? It has too many characters and is a complete utter mess of a story and sends out all the wrong signals in its muddled message. So now these same people praise this film that carries all the same damaging qualities if not more. This movie is about everything wrong in America and not in the right way. Here we see Captain America, a super hero that is meant to represent everything American. Naturally most Americans are going to follow the Cap as the protagonist, the right one, the hero. He's not. The Captain is asked to give some of his authority in order to keep the world in order because being the powerful man he is, he's still a human being and makes mistakes getting people hurt. I thought this was interesting until I realized where the Cap's character was going. He doesn't listen to the world and goes rogue. He hurts his friends and gets others killed all for him and his power he wants to keep. You know why? Because America thinks only they can be in control. The Captain literally represents the absurd conservative agenda of ""America first"". Captain America is Trump's America. Sure he's kinder and more good looking but his actions speak louder. I know that audiences are allowed to side more with Iron Man but the film is called CAPTAIN America: Civil War. So here we are with a completely misguided message in a movie that's being shown around the world. Well done Hollywood. Under the surface this film has such poor values it makes me sick. Not only is it a bad message its a mess of a story and there were just too many characters with no believable motivations. Don't even get me started on the colorless concrete block look of the movie. Marvel and DC both, please stop."
" Contrived Battle between Marvel Superheroes
",0.0516,0.9309,2017-05-18 00:00:00,2,"I saw the First Avenger but not Winter Solider before seeing this film. From what I understand, Bucky was Captain America's ally during WWII before being captured, brainwashed, and then transformed into the Winter Solider by the Russians. Even though Bucky causes so much mischief in this film (and I'm assuming the previous one as well), Captain America still places his greatest loyalty in him above everyone else and I mean EVERYONE ELSE. Granted, the mental conditioning that the Russians subjected Bucky to compromised his ability to think for himself, but that should have been more the reason not to trust the man. I don't care how good of a friend he would have been to me all those years ago. If I was Captain America, I wouldn't be the one protecting him; I would have been the one turning him in! The plot is centered on the villain's elaborate, nonsensical plan that would never have realistically worked by any stretch of the imagination. It involves framing Bucky, make-believing the villain's master plan was to topple the principle governments of the world, and sending the Avengers on a wild goose chase. All for what?: to simply show Tony Stark security footage revealing that it was Bucky who killed his parents while under the influence of Russian mind control. The villain could have simply mailed the tape to Tony Stark with the message ""Watch This."" (I did not need CinemaSins to point that out for me.) That would have been enough to drive the wedge between Iron Man and Captain America.The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because it does have some fairly intense fight scenes. The plot, however, is fundamentally flawed and a lame excuse to fulfill a comic-book nerd's dream of seeing which of his favorite Marvel heroes would win in that fight."
" Too much contrivance, insults the viewer's intelligence
",0.0772,-0.984,2017-05-13 00:00:00,6,"A movie can do everything else right, but if the story requires the characters to do something that they would never do, ignores a huge elephant in the room that no one would ignore, etc., then it suddenly becomes garbage because it forces me out of the experience of going along for the ride.This movie could have been good. I love superheroes, especially when movies work in lesser known heroes. There's some witty dialogue and plenty of star power and special effects. However, the plot has an absurd contrivance that I cannot get past.In order to plot Captain America versus Iron Man, the authors could not come up with an intelligent misunderstanding. Instead, Captain America's friend is framed for a crime and Iron Man thinks he's guilty, even when event after event makes this highly dubious, and even when his ""friend"" Captain America tells him he thinks his friend may be innocent. Sorry, based on the track record of this relationship in the movies, Iron Man would HAVE to step back and think twice about this friend's guilt if Captain America really asked him to.Moreover, when towards the end Iron Man learns the friend was framed, but learns this friend also had been previously brainwashed to kill in the past, and had killed his parents, he then tries quite un- heroically to kill Cap's now un-brainwashed (and framed) friend.What part of brainwashing and mind-control does Iron Man not understand? If some one kills while under the influence of brainwashing and mind-control, they are the VICTIM, and you do NOT try to kill them after they manage to escape and overcome the brainwashing and mind-control.The writers somehow thought they could just sweep this under the intellectual rug by just moving the action along very quickly, as if this would not give the audience time to connect the dots and see how ridiculous and unrealistic this ""dilemma"" really was. Sorry, there was no true dilemma. Captain America was right and Iron Man was wrong, completely, and in a ridiculously contrived manner."
" 10 minutes
",0.0,0.886,2017-05-13 00:00:00,2,"Captain America: Civil War was free to watch with Amazon Prime. I figured it would be worth a watch even though Super Hero movies are a real hit or miss. Many people love Marvel movies because they are bright, funny, and filled with action. Great examples of this are Deadpool and Iron Man. Unfortunately, I turned this movie off after 10 minutes. Someone please explain to me how a bunch of super heroes need Black Widow. This was part of the problem with the original Avenger's movie: You have Space Aliens with laser cannons and flying ships and we're going to send in a 125lbs woman in leather to shoot at them with a 9mm in between kicks. IT makes no sense. What's even worse is that they can make scenes with the hulk smashing cities and fighting an Iron Man Suit, but they can't have the Black widow balance enough to actually produce force in a kick or punch. It looks stupid. Not as stupid as Falcon's wings, but stupid enough to turn the movie off. Sorry Marvel fans, You have a Plethora of amazing Marvel Characters who could replace the Black widow. Too bad the studio feels it needs to keep trotting out the same illogical character choices. (BTW, Black widow is a spy and does great at infiltration. She doesn't need to be in big action sequences to be a part of the team)."
" Yawn
",0.0,-0.5514,2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,I found this to be comfortably the worst Avengers movie by far. A convoluted plot made it flat out boring. The notion of these guys fighting each other is not something I enjoyed. The lack of an appearance by Thor did not help though the appearance of Spidey somewhat counteracted this (the actor who played Spidey should be used again in the role). I found it really tiresome wading through what felt like a pointless two and a half hours and was relieved when it ended. The sooner the franchise gets back to good guys versus bad guys the better.
" ""Do you even remember them?. I remember all of them""
",0.0,0.9989,2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"The first outing that Anthony & Joe Russo had in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, did everything for me. It landed amongst my favorite films of all time and became my favorite film within the MCU. So you can imagine the anticipation level I had for this and after my first viewing of it, I knew I loved it.Leading up to the release of Captain America: Civil War, I couldn't sit still and I was beyond excited for it. As I watching it for the first time I couldn't believe just how great it turned out to be. Unlike previous superhero films released in 2016, Civil War hit me like a truck in its epicness and it resonated with me a lot more than I realized. Soon after that, I went to see it again in theaters and it still worked for me. Everything came together beautifully and it was a true masterpiece in my eyes.The things that both Russo Brothers did for the character of Captain America is brilliant. They knew how to handle him - from doing his sequel - and they knew how to handle a lot of characters, like Joss Whedon did. With just two films in, they've created two of the best comic book films to date, and two great films in their own. Their direction here is near flawless. With exception of a few scenes being a little to shaky, the way they shot action is done so well.Speaking of action, I don't think there's been great action like this since the first Avengers film. Its funny how well those two films feel like each other. In most cases Civil War is just Avengers 2.5, and I think the Russo's handled it so well. Not only does the hand-to-hand fighting feel tightly done and exciting, but the fighting done in bulk - like the airport scene - works so much better.After the second Avengers film I didn't think anyone could handle all those characters and plot points like Whedon did and yet, the Russo's do it perfectly. I love how this is just as a Captain America movie as it is an Iron Man movie. Going in I was Team Cap all the way, but watching it time and time I feel for both sides and I ended up switching on multiple occasions. That's why I think it works so well - the way that they handled each character and their arc. Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Vision, aren't A-list characters, but the Russo's used them to their advantage and made it work.I was really surprised on how performance driven Captain America: Civil War really is. Its political talk but its so interesting and it kept me interested. This is easily Robert Downey Jr's show because is acting here is really great. The speech he has about the young boy they kill is passionate and RDJ owns it. Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan both chip in fantastic performances and their chemistry together works. The team is also really great with Jeremy Renner being my favorite.The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man had me worried at first. I wanted so bad to see them on screen, but I didn't want them to be crammed in. Thankfully, they aren't. Tom Holland is perfect as Spider-Man. He has the dorky side that Tobey played so well, and he had the sweetness that Garfield had as Spider-Man himself. He was truly the perfect combination of both. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as well. He's got this vibe to the character of Black Panther that works so well. We all know that the MCU has villain problems, but it stops here. Daniel Brühl is magnificent as Zemo. He's badass, he's smart, his plan makes sense and his overall reason for it all is done so well.The film isn't a masterpiece in terms of film, nor is it as well crafted as some other comic book flicks before it. But there's something special about it every time I watch it. It could be my love for these characters, it could be the epic airport scene, or it could just be entertaining as all hell. I don't know what it truly is that makes this work for me, but Captain America: Civil War passed all my expectations and has made it a new favorite of mine for the years to come."
" BEST Marvel Movie so Far!
",0.8412,0.9957,2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"""Captain America Vs Iron Man! Wrong. It's Bucky Barnes Vs T'Challa - Nope, wrong again. It's Bucky Barnes Vs Tony Stark - Oh, wait, it's Steve Rogers' movie. Avenge!""The preface should tell you what the film is all about. Yes, it's one hell of a film!But I'll show you how to criticise it, still. With his propaganda-poster jawline, WW2 promotional adverts to fitness inspirational videos and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe.. Which is probably why, although this film or ""the Avengers 3 with a Boy Spidey and a giant Ant?"" - outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. Oh yeah, it's not entirely the ""American War Mongering"" spectacle titled Civil War (with Captain USA). Ignore the crap above, this is, as it should be, very much Cap's movie and Evans' Steve Rogers proves he's the heart and soul of the MCU. And no matter what, he's a good man - who has to make tough calls, who's essentially alone in the world despite the company of his superhero pals. His battle of ideologies with Tony is compelling, but it never quite evolves past the same argument being repeated throughout and both sides doing something to show why the other might be right. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them – Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff – to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs. The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain so great, and by extension America, also, great. But let's not get into that shall we? The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smack- down; the plot – hooked on an under- cooked vengeful grudge – is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches.The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man-boy-dork (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand- alone upcoming Spider-Movie - where Captain is returning the favour by making an unusual cameo, I think, based on the trailer). While the little guy, the ANT-MAN got a round of applause in most of the theatres/cinemas, including the one where I was at and I didn't even try to be cynical about it. It was great. Downey turns in an uncharacteristically morose turn as Tony, even moodier than he was in Age of Ultron and in parts of Iron Man 3. He certainly has his good reasons for being down, although it does sap the movie of some of the charm and fun Iron Man has long been relied on to deliver. His differing ideology from Cap's is the crux of Civil War's philosophical and literal battle, but, like 2016's Other Superhero v Superhero Movie, this heady and repetitive debate also grinds down the pacing at times. Between Civil War and Batman v Superman, hopefully both filmmakers and audiences have fulfilled their need to address the issue of collateral damage and can once again embrace what superhero movies do best, namely pure escapism. That's not at all to say superhero movies can't or shouldn't address heroes' moral culpability or echo real world concerns, but continually lecturing to and piling the guilt onto the protagonists (and, by extension, the viewer) for superheroes doing what superheroes do is growing rather tedious and, frankly, taking the fun out of the genre.As much as Cap and Tony's relationship is put to the test here, it's ultimately Cap's Bro-man-tic devotion to Bucky that trumps all else. Sebastian Stan once again finds the humanity in his cold warrior killer, and even gets a rival to Cap's affection in Anthony Mackie's Falcon. Their relationship is played mostly for comic relief to help offset the overwhelmingly tense and even gloomy tone of the movie. Know who else brings the chuckles to Civil War? Your friendly neighbourhood and highly anticipated new addition to the MCU... (Hint: He was beaten by some crappy insect).Overall, the Civil War does a far better job of juggling so many different characters than AOU or even X-Men. Sure it has a very complicated story-line but it's one hell of a film which you don't want to miss out on. While memorising who is in which of the colour- coded, armour-plated exoskeletons can be challenging, the sheer force of so much super-powered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie. And the best one from Marvel, yet.*A ""Spoiler"" not necessary need to be ""Alerted"" about: Stan Lee appears to mispronounce his own-created character's name: Tony Stark to Tony Something else!"
" Does not work as a film, only as a hub of the MCU's narrative
",0.0,-0.4845,2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Captain America 3 is more like Avengers 2.5, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe becomes truly a running narrative because of itSteve Rogers, leading the Avengers, continues to cause chaos across the world in a noble cause to stop terrorism, but powers that be have had enough. Spearheaded by Tony Stark, a new initiative is set up to keep heroes in check so no more innocent lives are lost in the crossfire. But this causes further strife between the two men as Rogers tracks down his brainwashed friend Bucky Barnes, who is still being used as the assassin Winter Soldier by shadowy forcesAfter Captain America: The Winter Soldier whipped up audiences and critics alike into a state of euphoria, Civil War has a lot to live up to. So is it surprising that the sequel falls a little short? Winter Soldier was a welcome change of pace and a change of tone, bringing the character into the modern world with a sense of urgency and political clout. Civil War by comparison is one part thriller and another part playset romp where all fifteen action figures are hurled about. When everything is said and done, and the dust settles, Civil War felt alarmingly vacuous.We have seen Marvel heroes fighting each other before, we've seen it a lot. Ever since Thor's hammer struck Cap's shield in Avengers Assemble, the franchise has indulged in the clashing and harmony of super powers. Civil War isn't driven by a theme or even a tone, in fact the only theme is quite literally ""heroes get to fight each other"", and there's a certain vagueness around motivations and morals of characters. Did Stark really just hire a high school student to go to war?? Did Falcon really know how to find Scott Lang? Did Hawkeye just come out of retirement? Why? Did Bucky really just fall back into the amnesia assassin story again?But having a theme about fighting isn't always bad. Hell no! The airport fight that the trailer teases, is so much fun. It had me laughing aloud in giddy, childish enthusiasm. Here we have ten superheroes from across the last two phases of the MCU punching each others lights out, but the star of the scene is Marvel's own interpretation of Spider-man. When the fight starts with Spidey asking Stark: ""So what do I do now Mr Stark?"" you know things are going to get ridiculously fun. If it weren't for this particular battle, Civil War would have been a colossal downer both in tone and execution.As great as Spider-man is in this fight, and as interesting as newcomer Black Panther is, both men feel shoehorned into the film. Peter Parker's introduction (as good as it is) virtually stalls the movie! It genuinely feels tacked on, perhaps due to Sony eventually giving up the rights to the character during Civil War's initial production phase, likely pushing Black Panther's screen time to accommodate the web slinger. The battle sequence that opens the film between Avengers and Crossbones (alias of a bit part player in Winter Soldier, who no one will remember, nor need to remember) has some of the worst shaky cam in recent memory. Not sure how critics are ignoring this. While a highway chase later on, which is a foot race, looks laughably fake.Ultimately, if you are keeping up with the Marvel movie narrative you will take more from this movie. Personally, I am putting my foot down to say that this continuous narrative device is getting tiresome. Civil War does not work as a singular film, it works as a hub connecting multiple movies from the past as well as numerous future projects together, but that isn't what I am looking for in a film.It is a fun movie (the dialogue is just as snappy as always) and it proves that the Russo Brothers can direct something as massive as the upcoming Marvel's Infinity War two parter with confidence. But it didn't feel like there was enough at stake, especially when everything is said and done; the ending felt really anticlimactic. It is a poor follow on from the concise Winter Soldier, but is perhaps the best Avengers film since 2012's Assemble."
" ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review
",-0.5994,0.9901,2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Eight years ago, Marvel took the reigns of the superhero genre with ""Iron Man."" Twelve films later and Batman, Superman and the X-Men are still playing catch up. With both the comic book fan and casual moviegoer in the palm of its hand, Marvel could have played it safe with this one. A run-of- the-mill action fest would have brought in the dough, while also entertaining the masses. But, yet again, Marvel showed us why it's number one.""Captain America: Civil War"" poses a question that may have crossed your mind while watching ""The Avengers"" or ""Age of Ultron"": in the midst of the mind-blowing action taking place on screen, how many innocent civilians were killed?Within the first half hour of the film, the Avengers are shown footage from major events in past Marvel movies, but rather than enjoying a shot of the Hulk smashing a few aliens into a building, the heroes see pieces of that building crush a bystander filming the chaos from his phone. Instead of watching Captain America throw his mighty shield, they are treated to the lifeless eyes of a woman caught in the crossfire of superhero and super villain.Shortly following this, Earth's mightiest heroes are presented with a document, called the Sokovia Accords, which states that the Avengers must place themselves under the command of the United Nations or retire. Tony Stark signs. Steve Rogers doesn't, ultimately pitting the two heroes against one another and leaving the rest to choose a side.While technically a Captain America story, ""Civil War"" plays out more like an Avengers 2.5, which works in the film's favor. The Russo brothers mesh the darker tone of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" with the humor of ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" masterfully balancing a plethora of characters new and old. The dialogue is thought provoking, the action is spectacular and the performances have never been better."
" Captain America Civil Yawn!
",0.0,-0.5774,2017-04-09 00:00:00,1,"Movie starts well & get's completely lost throughout. Once again the movie centers Bucky as the main reason. Movie was promised to be dark was far from it. The War was not even a war, & it was more of a practice battle of friends dancing, flirting & having fun. The final arc was once again the two lover boys it seems & ironman, with so many characters they were all ignored for Cap, Bucky & Iron. Overall the movie was very misleading, too many unnecessary characters (spidy - panther), repeated plot we've already seen in previous installments , not dark at all, multiple plots, big characters like Vision & scarlet were completely lost, horrible villain & one of Marvels worst films."
" Script is OK, good acting
",0.7034,0.4939,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Overall, compared with other series of CA & Avengers, this film is better (as good as Winter Soldier) in term of script and action scenes seems to be more realistic, the story is about normal life events and situation, not too much fictitious. I love the friendship between CA and Bucky as well Tony's ""family love"". I like character Bucky Barnes. This is anw an innocent ppl, a poor controlled-mind killer. This seems to be a complex character, a forced killers who feels guilty and lonely. I like Sebastian Stan's acting also, he has emotional talking eyes. I think the movie showed us possible situations/strategies in real life and led us to the tolerance and forgivenessA minor ""error"" is the presence of so many new characters, ant-man, spider kid, especially the spider kid.... very tiny/vague meaning"

Of course you have your neat action scenes and some enjoyable actors, but I have no interest in ever seeing it again. Maybe if I were into the comics or had watched the prequels it would have helped me with character development.So if you are content to watch one fun and expensive action scene after another, this is probably a good pick. I must be getting old. This is the first I can ever recall Aunt May being hot. Oh man do I miss the forums on here. Please bring them back!"
" Arguably the best MCU movie
",0.4939,0.9914,2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"i had the biggest grin while watching this movie. it's the most mature mcu movie but it manages to balance it out with fun moments. the airport scene is just nerd heaven seeing every superhero showcase their abilities in such unique and innovative ways was probably the best thing marvel has ever done. however one of my biggest critiques with not just this film but almost all mcu films is, they tend to have quite 'ugly' visual effects not the best cinematography and uses of color. but alas great watch i'm not sure how marvel will top this, we'll have to wait and see."
" Civil War is a masterclass in how to tell a great story and dazzle the senses
",0.0516,0.9966,2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"The three Captain America movies have all defied expectations. The first one was a great origin story that dated all the way back to 1940's but was still told in an engaging way and was far better than anyone thought it would be. The second C.A. movie, Winter Soldier, was set up as an espionage thriller that put a whole new spin on what a super hero story could be, beating even The Dark Knight at its own game. This third film does something even harder, and takes what many people thought was a subpar sequel to a great fist Avengers movie (Age of Ultron) and makes another Avengers movie within a perfectly good third Captain America movie, continuing the story of two engaging properties while expanding on both and tying them all together. It also successfully introduces classic charters like Black Panther, Baron Zemo, and the new and improved Spider Man. It also successfully improves upon the comic book origins on which it is based without losing any of the stories internal integrity. No wonder when comparing it to the other superhero team movies of the year (Suicide Squad, Batman vs. Superman, X-Men: Apocalypse), Civil War is a masterclass in how to tell a great story and dazzle the senses. Here's hoping people take notice."
" The Russo Brothers do it again !!!
",0.0,0.6981,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"ADVANTAGES: #1 The conclusion of the Avengers' activities: There are two Avengers movies so far and they both show us the same thing...the Avengers kicking ass fighting armies of CGI aliens/robots and facing no critisism from the goverment and most importantly from the people. In ""Civil War"" that doesn't happen because after an incident which resulted in collateral damage Captain America and his new team of Avengers are finally dealt from both the goverment and the people with some controversy. And that's the filmmakers trying to show us the other side of the coin...the dark truth Marvel movies lacked since now...the consequences of each battle. #2 The continuation of the Winter Soldier's story. ""Civil War"" not only continued Cap's search for his friend but it also made the Winter Soldier an extra factor for civil war to break out. The fact Cap didn't sign the Sokovia Accords might not have been an important reason to pit him against his team colleagues but the fact he was trying to help a former Hydra spy credited with dozens of assassinations crossed the line and it worked beautifully for both Captain America 3 and the Civil War story the movie was trying to tell. #3 The new characters. Black Panther finally makes his debut and he is awesome. They totally nailed him. Everything about him was perfect: the outfit, the nails, the combat and Chadwick Boseman's performance. Tom Holland's Spider-Man was great too although we haven't seen much of him yet. I liked the way he performed as Peter Parker, his combat style and the fact he developed the web-shooters on his own. Finally, I liked Daniel Brühl's Zemo. He might not be the faithful comic-book version of Baron Zemo but his character was realistic and had the perfect motivation. #4 The perfect way almost all characters were handled. The Russos did an awesome job by giving almost all characters a strong motivation to fight against each other and they all had their moment to shine and interact with one another. They also didn't cross the line by turning Captain America: Civil War into Avengers: Civil War keeping the story more focused and relatable to Captain America. #5 The action. What's there to say about the action? It was epic. It was perfectly choreographed and each character had his moments. The ending fight was mind-blowing, emotional and one of the best ones I've seen in a movie. #6 December 16, 1991. The movie starts with one of Winter Soldier's missions while being under Hydra's control and while this is a great way to start the movie so we may get a taste of what the Winter Soldier has done over the years, it serves the plot of the film perfectly. The persons Bucky murdered in December 16, 1991 were Tony's parents. It was an epic moment when Zemo showed the footage of that night to Tony, Cap and Bucky and not only it gave these characters a reason to get back to fighting each other once again but it also was a shocking moment and a brilliant plot-twist.
DISADVANTAGES:
1# About Spider-Man and Ant-Man. ""Civil War"" finally introduces the MCU version of Spider-Man and despite the fact it was fan watching him back in action, his involvement in the war didn't make much sense.The fact Tony knows that the wall-crawler is actually Peter Parker is not yet clear considering the videos he had only show Spider- Man helping people while he's wearing a mask.Plus, in this movie Tony becomes more responsible and he joins the government and signs the Sokovia Accords, so I find it quite irresponsible and contradictory bringing a 16- year old boy in a battle in which he could have ended up like War Machine or even worse. The other character that didn't quite fit in the story is Ant-Man. Scott Lang has been a criminal who is now starting to become the hero he would never dream of. The fact he joins Captain America and steps out of the law (AGAIN) doesn't make any sense. Not only he breaks the law again but he has absolutely no motivation to get involved in the war. Has his friendship with Sam Wilson aka Falcon become so powerful since their last meeting that he's willing to risk going back to imprisonment instead of embracing his role as a father and live his life with his daughter?#2 The Humor.
After a dark and without many jokes Captain America 2 I was expecting ""Civil War"" to be if not darker than the ""The Winter Soldier"" then at least more serious. But it wasn't. There were some very funny moments in the movie that I liked but overall it had quite a lot of humor in it. Especially in the airport scene in which the two teams were fighting each other there is a huge amount of jokes and it's disappointing watching avenger vs. avenger (which is like family vs. family at this point in the MCU) cracking jokes and not being serious about it.#3 No Consequences. The final throw down ends with Tony being defeated and Cap trying to help his friend Bucky. And while this is a great way for the movie to end, a few minutes after we see Tony in the Avengers' HQ receiving a letter from Steve saying: ""When Thanos arrives just give me a call and I'll be there"". Well, that's not what he said but the movie ends with a very optimistic way which suggests that no matter what happened between them, Steve and Tony can still get along and they will. Still despite the fact ""Civil War"" showed us the conclusion of the Avengers' activities and the collateral damage they had caused over the years, the movie ends with not even one major character dying and not only it does that but it also tries to reconstruct Steve's relationship with Tony ignoring the fact they were fighting to death a few scenes ago.

" Good, but the story is not really up to other Marvel movies
",0.6858,-0.932,2017-03-11 00:00:00,6,"There is much to like about Captain America: Civil War, another of Marvel's superhero movies. It ties in with both the Captain America series (naturally) but also the Avenger movies, as almost of all of the heroes makes an appearance. It also builds on a logical thought from the other movies, albeit that they save the world, the Avengers also cause massive destruction whenever they appear. The ""civilian"" world will try to take control. And this naturally leads to strife within the Avengers. But that is also the biggest problem with the movie. The story inevitably leads to spectacular, effects filled fights between the different Avengers. But there is no suspense, I could never really believe that any of the heroes really beating (and hurting) one of the others. The fights are just as spectacular as anyone can wish, they should be the movies main event. But since it is known from the beginning that no one will really win or lose, the story come to something of a standstill during the fights. Ironically, during these action-packed scenes, nothing really important happens.As Marvel's movies always is, this is entertaining. Witty and fast dialog, action-packed scenes and good effects. But it would have been better if they would have fought one of the bad guys. It would have surely been full of clichés then too, but then the fights would have meant more, not been so predictable. As such, Civil War doesn't really rise to the standard of the other movies of the Avengers."
" civil war is about captain America and iron-man fighting over weather they should allow the government to interfere with their work.
",-0.6705,0.8731,2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Civil War is my favorite movie of 2016. I usually don't go to theaters to watch films, but I'm glad I went to this one. At firs, i was afraid that the movie wasn't going to be very good. I was disappointed with the rise of Ultron and other Marvel movies that privately came out. I was also worried that the pacing was going to be a mess after I heard that Disney was re-shooting part of the movie to incorporate Spider-man after they struck a deal with Sony. I decided to go and see the movie despite my worries because at list I would see my two favorite comic book character Captain America and Iron-man fight each other. The movie turned out to be better than I expected. The passing was good the fight scenes war amazing, and Spider-man didn't seem to out of place in the movie. The movie itself is about United Nations deciding that the Avengers are too much of a liability. So they come up with an accord a document that gave the U.N absolute power over the Avengers. Captain America and a few others Avengers disagreed with the U.N diocesan. The captain thinks the United Nations will abuse their power and make the Avengers go after people that aren't necessarily a threat. Iron-man was then guilt-tripped into accepting the accord. This causes conflict between the Avengers which results in one awesome fight scene. the story itself doesn't make much sense, and the beginning is somewhat boring, but the ending does make up for it."
" Too Many Spectacular CGI Showdowns and Terrible Ending!
",-0.5255,-0.9895,2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"It's a Civil War between the Avengers as an International Peace Accord outlaws part of the team, which is then split into two factions. MIA are The Hulk and a few other Superheroes. Of course they can't kill each other, but there is a lot of destruction and mayhem. Innocent people die and that is the reason for the ""Accord"". Bucky Barnes is a ""Manchurian Candidate"", both Capt. Steve Rogers ""sidekick"" and a terrible assassin. It turns out than he killed Tony Stark's parents while under Russian or Hydra control. That new gal is really quite ""electrifying""! Antman is amazing. Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) is a great reason to watch any movie! Now will somebody please explain to me how the ""mortal-but-enhanced"" beings keep from getting wounded or dying, like The Black Panther? I suspect that Natasha Romanoff is a female-Russian version of the Captain and pretty-much indestructible. Pretty much non-stop CGI between long stretches of dialog. A terrible and sad ending. Heroes are broken, on-the-mend, or imprisoned. It's all for the revenge of one man for the death of his family during one of the Avengers ""rampages"" in Eastern Europe. Bucky Barnes goes back in ""cold storage"" as he can't resolve the guilt from all the murders his alter-ego committed. Not for repeat viewing by me. I didn't like it at all. Review lowered to 7 stars due to final outcome. I went away depressed, unhappy and weary. Too much CGI and a two-and-a-half hour flick just wears me out!"

And director Joss Whedon makes sure the action is as big as its stars: Androids do battle in breathtaking scenes, worlds literally fall apart, and superheroes rescue and do good from one breathless moment to the next. The dialogue moves pretty quickly, too, inflected with humor.But this many important characters makes for a crowded movie, with little time to allow a complicated story line actual room to unfurl.

It is a smart film and well structured, but the giant battle in the middle overshadows everything else in the movie, maybe everything in every Marvel movie. Ant Man, Spider Man, The Vision, Scarlet Witch--it was great seeing it all come to life. I wasn't especially invested with the central conflict of why the group would be willing to fight each other, and I didn't care much about the reason they came up with in order to get Tony Stark and Steve Rogers against each other. I liked the Armor Wars storyline better as far as setting up that battle. But this is a movie with a lot of repeat viewability. It isn't nonstop fun like Guardians of the Galaxy, but it isn't as serious as Winter Soldier--more like a blend of the two. It ended up giving us another reason to hope for good things from the Infinity War series."

" Too Much CG Spioils An Otherwise Good Film
",0.4404,0.9207,2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.I see some people calling this the best Marvel film yet, and right now it sits at a 7.9 on IMDb. I would have to respectfully disagree with these champions of the film. While I do think it is a decent plot, and does a fine job of showing the philosophical differences between Iron Man and Captain America, it has two big issues for me.One, it is far too dependent on CGI. I would rather see more physical effects, even if they might be less ""spectacular"". Frankly, I am not impressed by the CGI because any time something happens action-wise, it becomes very obvious the characters are drawn in and not played by actors. I understand that action is important to a superhero movie, but why must it be the worst-looking part? And two, while the plot does do something for character development, it really has very little to offer as far as a story. The characters seem to have very little growth. My impression is the whole point of the film was merely to set up Spider-Man and Black Panther for their own films. It definitely didn't do much for anyone else."
" Top notch Superhero film
",0.2023,0.7473,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"The third film in the Captain America series sees more of an ensemble cast and less of a Captain America film. Though this may be such a bad thing in hindsight. Things only get uglier between these groups when Captain America's old pal-turned fugitive the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is accused of killing civilians, and the Avengers' leader, believing his friend is innocent, helps him escape.Once settled further into the film, there are a lot of side stories to Civil War. And really, nearly two-thirds of the film is just a setup to the big payoff. That super powered conflict in the film's title. And when it arrives, it doesn't disappoint, as a retired Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an ""I'm just happy to be here"" Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), a newly teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his first major fight, and movie screen newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the fray. Their five-on-five battle may seem like CGI overkill, but directors brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, who directed arguably Marvel's best film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, know how to stage the war. The film does feel quite long but it is needed to be seeing how many more characters there are. For an entertainment value, Captain America: Civil War lives up to its expectations and it delivers. As a rewatch 07/06/17' this latest Captain America film feels more relaxing and adjusts as more to an Avengers film, but in a way that isn't much of a problem. The clear highlight is with the 12 Avengers coming together and battling out with each other on the city's rooftop for a lengthy awaited battle."
" Don't bother
",0.2584,-0.4696,2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"The reason Im writing is to show my disappointment with IMDb and its ratings. Usually I go to this site to look a movie up, and usually it gives good info and honest rating. But this time, for this movie, its just nothing less than a travesty. There is NO way this movie can be regarded as high as it stands. And after reading many of the reviews on this site, it shouldn't. The movie is so heavy with its own sense of importance its actually painful to bear. The stories, and there are plenty, are shallow and childish, but the viewer is told that no, they really are deep and matter and you should understand that. I felt jumped by a morale that it tried to present, that the characters were actually fighting something deeper than just spider webs and things thrown at them, that they actually were to be taken seriously. Just for that, the movie tired me. But worse, it bored me. And not because there was not enough action in it, or that not enough things happened, because on the contrary, the scenes were filled with crap it felt an urge to show me. And more and more and more. Man! Puh. But OK, some people like to make this kind of stuff and some people like watching it. But please ... don't treat it like its Sophie's Choice. Don't try to tell me that it is intelligent and has a deeper saying. That it treats real problems, that it tackles important social issues. Don't tell me that this film has something to say. Because it doesn't. It isn't important. Its a super hero movie and its light and should be fun. Nothing more. But it does not, not for me anyway, deserve a 7.9 rating. No f***ing way."
" ""Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth""
",0.6124,0.9917,2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,Civil War blends the incredible action sequences and humor from The Avengers while also bringing real depth and pathos to plot and character that was done so well in The Winter Soldier. It really is every comic geeks dream come true to see these kinds of movies brought to the screen like this so well. The film is stuffed full of so many beloved characters yet somehow pulls it off. Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther is a fascinating character I am already eager to see develop more in his own movie and Paul Rudd as Ant Man is a welcome addition to the team and steals every scene he is in. Of course the biggest treat is Tom Holland as Spider-Man who reboots the character in the best way possible and gives much promise to his own movie franchise. The film is brought together by Robert Downey Jrs Iron Man and Chris Evans Captain America. These two actors are so well cast for the roles it really is impossible to imagine who will play them once the actors decide to move on. This is one of the best super hero movies hands down.
" For the Director and Producers
",0.0,0.9316,2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"The King T' Chaka is speaking Zulu to his son. If you want to make up a fake country and use any African dialect or a made up one sure, go ahead, but we love Marvel also and you owe it to African viewers to be authentic. If you hire a South African actor, good for you but he has to speak a Nigerian dialect or then change the name of the country he is representing. You have producers you pay for that reason! But the Hollywood idea of thinking only of American viewers who see ""other languages"" as gibberish is offensive to us who understand and pay money only to see have our cultures misrepresented. Hollywood has produced quite a few movies with African actors speaking different languages and pretending to be having a conversation. Yes, its acting! I know someone is going to say that!"
" Fantastic, looking ahead for more
",0.5574,0.9931,2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I will begin by discussing each of the important characters and how they influenced the movie.Iron Man: Continued to be hilarious, but also had an incredible emotional side that was not very evident in the previous films. RDJ's portrayal of Stark continues to amaze me.Captain America: Chris Evans' portrayal of Cap is always refreshing, and his ability to be the moral compass of the group was unparalleled. Multiple of his scenes were done without much CG, specifically the Helicopter scene, which is amazing.Winter Soldier: Sebastian Stan plays it well as a guilt ridden, former assassin who wants nothing more than to live a peaceful life, but gets forced into fighting when he clearly doesn't want to. Stan is able to bring some levity but also shows us the range of his dramatic acting.Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye: I am putting them together because for a majority of the film, they are working together. While Renner does not add much to the plot, he does add to the character driven performances, spouting clever dialogue. Olsen shows a range of emotion, from the shock of the explosion in Lagos to the fury of Vision preventing her from leaving. The effects with her were incredible.Vision: Bettany establishes Vision as a still ""young"" and naive person, still trying to mesh with the humans around him. He is humanized more in this film than in Age of Ultron, but this humanization brings humor when it clashes with his robotic side.Ant-Man: Scott gets thrown into the mix, like Spiderman, and is able to provide clever dialogue and a pretty intense Giant Man moment. His main part in the film is his humor, which he nails perfectly.War Machine, Falcon, Black Widow: None of these characters had a particular importance to the plot, but were all fantastic actors/actress and had some great dialogue.Zemo: Many people criticize Zemo for being a bad villain, but he was one of the best in the MCU to date. His focus on a small scale goal of tearing the avengers apart rather than conquering the world and his human motivation establishes him as a compelling and credible threat. He emphasizes that he doesn't have the power to destroy the avengers, but he was able to tear them apart from the inside.Spiderman: Holland was 19 years old when he got this role. He is 3 months older than I am, and he was able to steal the show, surrounded by some of Hollywood's biggest A-list actors. This is the best portrayal of Spiderman so far in live-action. Sorry Tobey.Black Panther: Chadwick Boseman was incredible with his portrayal of Black Panther. His accent was on point, his fight scenes were incredible, and his emotional narrative was the perfect compliment to the arcs of Captain America and Iron Man.Special effects were on point, Vision's density shifts along with Ant- Man's abilities were fantastic. The additional practical effects were extremely convincing. Also, the giant black panther statues were awe inspiring.The only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because the movie does not tell as much of a self contained story, but rather it sets up the next few movies in the MCU.Also, Stan Lee's cameo was as clever as Tony Stank."
" Great movie, but made for the wrong reasons
",-0.3818,0.9663,2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"The movie failed for me, I didn't feel the motivation that the characters had and I kinda felt like the movie was an excuse for the Marvel heroes to fight one another. That aside the cinematography was good (not great) and credits to that stunt crew!﻿ I also experienced Iron Man being very annoying, which is a weird first time to see it this far. I feel like this was an opportunity for this franchise to do something endearing, but it ended up with a movie without purpose. Action for me is best when it is re-watchable and you can go back to the movie, whenever you feel like getting entertained. So 5/10 score as decent, but it didn't break anything (Other than having a good Spiderman of course)"
" I did not like it at all
",-0.2755,0.9693,2017-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.I want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only ""incriminating"" the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.When I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.The few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.Technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie."
" Really enjoyed this...
",0.5563,0.996,2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,"I finally saw this movie and I got to say it was awesome I really did enjoy it it had a lot of action and it was good to finally see the first appearance of Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man the airport fight scene was probably my favorite one in this movie apart from the scene closer to the end when Iron Man finds out that Bucky killed his father but he didn't know what he was doing as he was not himself after that a huge fight between Captain America,Iron Man and Bucky began this movie is so action packed apart from the one scene where Tony Stark goes to Queens to see Peter Parker and ask for help in this Captain America and Iron Man are at each other's throats because everyone else in the Avengers signed this new thing that would let the government tell them where to go,what to do and who to help but he refused to do it as he thought that the Avengers should still have the right to do that that's the main reason why it caused this rift between them. I also like how Bucky and Steve reunite that was an awesome scene as well I honestly can't find a single flaw in this other than the somewhat long and slow conversation between Peter and Tony that dragged on a little but I was glad to see Peter on screen for the first time also Ant-Man was pretty cool too I've never seen the stand alone movie about him and how he became that though this is probably my favorite of the 3...The First Avenger was good to me but was kind of corny the action was good though but wasn't a fan of Hugo Weaving as Red Skull this is the only time I didn't really like him much in a movie,The Winter Soldier was awesome I really enjoyed it but this this outdid both by far in my opinion and I would highly recommend it if you have not seen it yet I give it a 9/10."
" It's action-packed, it's fast, but there's not much tension and 'war' is nowhere to be found.
",0.3491,-0.9423,2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Captain America: Civil War adapts Mark Millar's popular comic book that saw the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and much of the Marvel Universe collide. The comic was filled with deaths, betrayals and fantastic monologues that furthered the dark side of the Marvel Universe that we had previously seen in stories like House of M.Unlike the comic, the movie feels much smaller and more personal to Captain America. Sure, you can call this Avengers 2.5 but it still feels like what is is as heart; a Captain America movie. Captain America: Civil War is packed with some incredible fight scenes and an engaging plot which differs dramatically from the source material it's adapting. We have spent numerous movies with these characters and to see the compromises they make in this film is what makes it stand out.While the Avengers are on a mission, their carelessness leads to the deaths of innocent civilians and political pressure begins to squeeze them into choosing a side; Save the day with absolute freedom or fight by order of bureaucrats. While previous MCU films are all about fun, adventure and heroism, Civil War brings the universe into a real world with real consequences. If the events that took place in both Avengers movies were real life, there would be hundreds of innocent lives lost and this would be something that is immediately brought up, yet we don't hear about that grim side of it until this movie. The characters and the audience are both being smacked in the face with consequence. It's what Watchmen (2009) and The Incredibles (2004) do so damn well. However, the film isn't necessarily a downer. Unlike Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the film still has plenty of the humour and fun that the MCU has come to be so widely known for (not that that's a fault of BvS). So there's a mixture of seriousness and jokiness, and I don't think that works too well.Until the final few scenes, I never felt any real tension. The first act is full of reasons why the Avengers is a controversial branch of the once mighty S.H.I.E.L.D and so we understand that something big has to happen, and once the Avengers take sides, we expect brutal, death-filled warfare. After all, the movie has 'war' in the title. However, the second act contains an action scene that felt as though it was out of a completely different MCU film. One with a lighter tone; where there were no real worries and it was all about fun. They have come here to fight and if needs be, kill each other in order to make a stand and have their way in an incredibly important and serious issue. So what do they do? Why, they tell jokes of course! They're not supposed to be having fun. They should be terrified about the outcome of the fight but it's not even clear if they want to kill each other or not. Of course, like every MCU movie, there are no major characters who die (and stay dead). This takes away the impact and any tension the 'airport' scene could have had had there been one or even two characters die. The airport scene is one that was made to entertain, rather than propel the story.In comparison, the final confrontation between Rogers, Bucky and Stark is brilliant. This fight has raw emotion. It's brutal! Where the airport sequence focused on spectacle and great big set pieces, this fight has a much smaller scale, yet the stakes are so much greater. There has never been a fight in the MCU like the fight at the end of Civil War and I'm not sure we'll ever get one like it again.My favourite thing about this movie is the philosophy that weaves the story and separates the characters. The Dark Knight sees Batman and the Joker fight a battle of wits; Daredevil Season 2 sees Daredevil and the Punisher collide in both verbal and physical battle; Batman v Superman takes Batman's anger and plots it against Superman's naivety; Captain America: Civil War has the patriotism of Captain America go up against the compromising and regretful Iron Man. The writers, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, do an excellent job of giving reasoning and understanding as to why there is conflict and why the two lead characters take different sides, but the minor characters don't seem to get enough screen time or dialogue. They pretty much decide their team in a few lines or less. It doesn't feel like the characters made the decisions themselves, but the writers. Along with the good writing for the lead characters, both Robert Downey Junior and Captain America give their best performances of the MCU thus far. As far as newcomers go, Black Panther and Spider-Man had great on-screen presence. Chadwick Boseman gives a fine performance and his character has a touching and inspired arc. Tom Holland brings a Spider-Man that we've never really seen before. He is very much like the Spider-Man from the Ultimate universe, in that he looks a lot younger and doesn't shut up. Although a little shoehorned in, he works really well throughout his sequences and it was a great advert for Spider-Man: Homecoming.The film almost feels like one producer wanted them to go dark with this and another wanted them to stick to the usual MCU feel. When War Machine is blown out the sky and free falls into the ground, he should be dead. No question. But it's the MCU and so he is more or less fine. He's walking again not soon after. It's this sort of thing that makes me a little sick of the MCU. It almost feels like schlock. Same formula, same result. I have to say, I enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as much as I wanted to.

" 20 steps to make a Marvel movie.
",0.4215,-0.8994,2017-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Feel like making a few extra billion dollars without using any effort? Well, you're in luck! Here's my 20 simple steps on making a Marvel movie:1. Start with fight scenes2. Find as many random comic book references as possible and cram them into the ""story"" 3. Add as many characters into the ""plot"" even if it becomes way too crowded 4. Add fight scenes 5. Make the dialog lol-tastic and quirky playful banter, despite being a ""dark"" movie 6. Oh wait, the movie is dark again, be sure to make the film go into dramatic mode, where there are no sound effects except for echoed ""NOOO!""'s and the swelling music7. Add fight scenes 8. Throw in a few random chuckle-worthy lines. Make sure the music stops when this happens, letting the audience know that something funny is being said9. Make the editing schizophrenic and impossible to see anything, especially during the fight scenes. This ensures that viewers cant see anything that's going on during all 5,932 action scenes 10. More fight scenes, plus explosions 11. More comic book references 12. Make it at least 140 minutes in runtime to make it seem more epic 13. Add in yet more characters, this time for the sake of making more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will... 14. Make the directing as obvious as possible, thus eliminating all suspense or deeper thinking. Remember, your audience is stupid and only want explosions... 15. Add more explosions to more fight scenes 16. Make the villain a goofy wise ass who exchanges quirky banter with the characters instead of making it him/her an intimidating foe 17. Throw in a random love arc. DRAMA!!!!!!! 18. Tell your composer to write the most bland score ever 19. Whatever comic book references and characters you have left, no matter how small or pointless, THROW THEM INTO THE SCRIPT! Just dump the entire bucket into the pool! 20. Finish with more fight scenes.There! In just 20 brief steps, you'll make a guaranteed billion dollars. If you're a DC executive wondering how to make BvS2 or Justice League reach that big B, just follow this list and you'll be rolling in the green in no time. No need to worry about a story, plot, or screenplay, because that crap takes too much time. Instead, just follow my list to become the next Warren Buffett of quickly-aging cinema.

" Captain Ameria: Civil War*******
",0.0,0.9933,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"The Russo Brothers' Captain America: Civil War was a very good film. I do believe that the title adapted from the critically acclaimed graphic novel written by Mark Millar, did not suit it. I felt that an adaption of this title could've have better been saved for another movie, truly felt wasted. In general, I thought the movie was solid but somewhat of a let down, not on the same level and excitement that Captain America: The Winter Soldier gave me but a great effort nonetheless. And honestly, this feels more like an Avengers 2.5 movie rather than a Captain America 3 movie. My favorite things about the movie are Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America as always he does a great job, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther, and Tom Hollad's Peter Parker/Spider-Man. 1 of my least favorite things were Robert Downey Jr.'s character development had taken a toll. As I stated, it was a good film, a step down from the last, but good."
" Justice is bigger than the UN.
",0.5267,0.998,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Like in a typical Marvel Movie, this one has many instruments in it.Fun, enemy emergence, intelligence, humor, fun, Western-like entrances, fun again, plot twists, enemy confrontation, lots of fight, fun, cars exploding, planes / helicopters crashing, funny dialogues, good guys differing on the subject, enemy reaching out for the purpose, good guys feeling emotional towards each other, less fun, the enemy is to be defeated, good guys feel heart-broken and go on their separate ways... oh a little fun at the end, too. Wait, don't forget to check for the last scene after the credits!.. Wow, that was close!..So, it was all carefully put together so that we remember what had happened since the very first movie. Therefore, we are ready for this...First of all, Steve Rogers is a man not many nations nor countries can understand to the fullest. He has higher values any institutions in the USA can provide in the 21st century. Because, as we all know, the capitalism and the pragmatism were closing in on each other and did combine in the 20th century, and the results including the ""rightful ones"" seem to undermine the rights of the ""little guys."" For instance, if a ""hero"" is to die, it is better for these two ""values"" that a hundred people die to save this hero than the death of the hero.But, to Steve Rogers, it is more simple than interest related. How is that so?.. He thinks that no one is more important than another, save the heroes not. If there is an interest in a fight, he will only uphold the truth. Okay, okay. It seemed exaggerated! So, he tried to stop Tony Stark by saying Bucky is his friend. But the reason he kept standing beside the Winter Soldier is because the Winter Soldier was used against his will. Yes, even in the dark side, it is up to the ""will to power"" to be truly dark...On the other hand, Tony Stark is a man of ego. Hey, this is hard to say, too. By the way, he fights for the truth and good of the people; but if the things get complicated, he is easily distracted and blindfolded to the truth. More to it is that he won't stop until he ""succeeds"" in doing the ""right thing"". But, it nearly always emanates from his own ego... Sad.The other guys / heroes that gather around either one of them are soldiers rather than commanders. No, they are friends. And friends can be half-blind to the truth... Therefore they all do feel that they follow the right side.Okay, verily, no one is saying that one of both sides is 100 percent the ""right side"". All are human, so is to err. But, Steve Rogers' way seems more humane. He cares for everyone; not just the well being of the USA.Overall, the actions scenes are easy to follow. Good.All acting is good. But Mr. Chris Evans and Mr. Robert Downey Jr. do a great job together. They are the stars of this one. Good!..The dialogues are well-measured.The soundtracks are okay.The son who goes straight to the dark side broke the pattern and thought again about what to do. Good.No hero / person killed another person willingly. Oh, this is an understatement. I accept that. But, you see, I was raised by the capitalism and pragmatism... So, I go by the big numbers, too. (No, I don't.)At last, we can say that it will be interesting to see the quarrel suppurate in the next movie.The new Spider-man seems very likable. I hope he will be the best in decades!..""And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which doeth wrong until it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make peace between them justly, and act equitably. Verily! Allah loveth the equitable.""---The Gracious Koran, the 9th Verse in the 49th Chapter (called The Twellings)---"
" Worst story ever
",-0.6249,0.0768,2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I'm basing my review on the Storyline that is published so no spoiler will be found her. This is the most ridiculous story of a movie I've seen in a long time. The Avengers are blamed for the victims of the attacks of various villains. The entire movie is based on this idea, they ARE the new villains. In addition, you can read in the Storyline that a war-like battle between them begins. Again, ridiculous. It is obvious that in reality they won't fight over an idea. I gave it 5 points because the action is very good, so one can see and enjoy the movie, while giggling at the story. The movie received a good grade in total but this is due to fans (like me) that vote in favor. You should vote as you really think. Last, the movie is more like Avengers 3 then Captain America 3."

The name of the movie Captain America?? But looks like avengers. Action action action, without aim...I have spent my time for nothing. Unfortunately following movie will be come. Spiderman appeared at the end of the movie, in the next movie we are waiting for Batman and more. Superhero party is underway. First movies about mixing superheroes in one movies like avengers was OK. But if the main hero is captain America so be it.

" Civil War: What is good for
",-0.25,0.9286,2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have."
" Given what they spent, likely felt compelled the additional dull 45 minutes
",-0.3612,0.7864,2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"When Ant Man gets really big, shouldn't have become just a bigger easy target given he has no real powers? And when will there be a giant Ant Man vs. Godzilla movie? Come on Hollywood get it together! Anywho, this over-earnest summer popcorn movie comes out under the banner of Captain America played by the charisma-free but purdy Chris Evans but secretly and wisely treats RDJ's Tony Stark as the main attraction. A boatload of other characters clog the film many becoming forgettable during actual scenes (oh yeah, Bucky the Winter Soldier IS still in this shot). The film also makes the George Lucas second Star Wars series of spending too much time listening to politicians argue about characters who could be performing some action scene. Not that the movie lacks for action, it just comes in prolonged, interminable sequences particularly an ending fight between ""Cap"" and Ironman (oh, yeah and Bucky, he was in much of that scene) which goes on longer than The Thrilla in Manilla and yet doesn't resolve much. The movie does provide more Easter eggs than your Aunt Sally's for her annual egg hunt which will give you something to do rather than listen to the rebellious, free-thinking maverick Tony Stark incongruously argue for United Nations oversight. In short, yeah, you know it's not any of the Fantastic Four movies but not quite the first Ironman."
" Epic yet predictable
",0.0,0.7535,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"So this film was hyped to death coming up to its initial release. One of the most anticipated superhero films, arguably on par with The Avengers.Now, the cynical viewer would easily point out the parallels this film has with Batman vs Superman (i.e. the government taking action against vigilantism, two superheroes and their rag-tag groups taking opposing sides of the same agenda, a sinister mastermind orchestrating the situation in which these characters oppose one another, and so forth.) However, while the DC cinematic universe have given us minimal source material of these versions of their classic superheroes, Marvel are about ten steps ahead, having fleshed out every character in the ensemble from previous films (well...bar two but we'll get to that) The plot seems a lot to take in. While the whole Sokovia Accords legislation drama is mainly taking centre stage, Cap must try to save Bucky from himself, as the ghosts of his past come back to consume him, figuratively speaking. Cap and Bucky try to stop the 'villain', Zemo from awakening a group of other enhanced assassins and try to evade the law enforcement in place after their successions at saving the world are misconstrued due to the collateral damage.The superhero subplot turns out to be a complete red herring as Zemo successfully lures our main characters into a Russian bunker and revealing that Bucky killed Stark's parents, which leads to the true battle between Cap and Stark.Overall, the movie is serviceable, even if the cast list does seem excessive. The inclusion of Spiderman and Black Panther doesn't feel too much like it was shoehorned in, but many would make the argument. The airport fight scene between the Avengers factions takes a while to get to but the drama is constant, meanwhile.Ultimately, you know that there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because Marvel still have a dozen more of these films to dish out. The cycle is getting a little repetitive, but if you're looking for good action, cool visuals and superheroes generally doing their thing, you're in luck."
" scarlett
",0.0,0.4664,2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"After Winter Soldier I was under the (apparently mistaken) belief that Marvel's Capt. America franchise was criticising neoliberal America. There was all that stuff about the ends not justifying the means and about how politicians use terror to convince the population they need to be oppressed for their own good. How wrong could I be! Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt. America criticises the State for oppressing people whilst simultaneously adhering to exactly the sort of high-handed moral superiority that inevitably leads to that oppression.Btw, Scarlett is awesome,you can see this http://www.haberligunler.com/scarlett- johansson-2016-yilinda-en-cok-kazanan-oldu-7379-haber .

" A fictional fantasy easy to swallow
",0.4404,0.1852,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I always check a page of previous comments, mainly to verify I'm on the right webpage but also to verify I watched the same movie and possibly to purr at shared opinions. This time I was very surprised at the vehemence of the angry dislike and scorn of most commenters to the latest Marvel offering, because as a non-purist it was basically what I expected: fantastic in the expected sense, not great as expected but I quite enjoyed it, as I'd hoped.There's a rift in the lute betwixt Iron Man and Captain America and a spat develops when the Avengers are told by a mere 117 governments they must be officially registered to be allowed to continue saving the Earth. Iron Man and his motley crew side with the UN, the latter with his team side with Good. For a commercial work of fantasy it works. If all the Avengers had appeared in a scene singing and dancing in top hats and suspenders I would have accepted it in the same way we have to accept scenes like Bucky stopping and mounting a motorbike going by at speed one-handed and riding it away, or America mega-leaping from a building to the edge of another and continue running with no damage. Thumping whilst flying is routine and as for stopping a helicopter in mid-flight with your bare hands, well that kind of thing happens every day! I do have a minor problem with the chances of a traffic camera being nicely on hand in 1991 to record Stark's parents' brutal murders, the videotape surviving, and being suddenly available to the understandably outraged Tony 25 years later - in front of the murderer. But not much. You can appreciate that an appearance by Hulk would've made for a rather one-sided battle, but I admit I'm puzzled why Thor was excluded. The plot and acting is suitably unbelievable, the many action scenes are so superbly cartoon as to make Jason Bourne look a doddering old fool. My only worry is that it can't be long before the MCU, like the books, disappears up its own fiendishly incoherent plot vortex. Expect no ending, for there no ending in this world.This franchise is financed by hard headed business people expecting only a profit but made by creative people who appreciate what they're doing as well. And in the main it'll be watched by people already looking forward to the next satisfactory Marvel time-filler probably including the real D. Trump too I expect."
" Best MCU movie to date
",0.6369,0.553,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,After seeing this for the first time in the cinema I was speechless. This really is the best MCU movie to date and shows you just how far the MCU has come. The main reason this film worked is because the characters in this universe have lots of history going back to Iron Man and Captain America: The first avenger. This makes there be so much more weight to their actions. All the actors are on top form especially Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Special mentions go to Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man who slot in effortlessly and take turns completely stealing the show. The villain Helmut Zemo was also great and much more human than we're used to for villains. His story about how his family died is heartbreaking and I'm intrigued for what he does next. The standout scene has to be the airport scene featuring the debut of Giant Man which will go down in marvel legend. Simply put this is an amazing film with great action and many impressive character arcs. Bring on Infinity War.
" Best Avenger movie yet
",0.6369,0.9116,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"When nations get together and decide the Avengers need to be supervised rather than allowed to fight evil on their own terms, it causes a split in the group. The Iron Man leads the group that joins the government, but Captain America refuses to surrender his independence and leads a group that is going its own way in pursuit of an evil man who is using psychological control to deploy terrorists.The dialogue is a bit hokey in places, but, that's the beauty of the Avenger movies, it's about a more innocent time when such hokey dialogue was the way people really talked. Lots of extra characters in this one, including an African king's son who is a cat figure with amazing powers, and Spider Man, an adolescent fighting with the grownups. While this one is typical Marvel action, there are also some philosophical messages skillfully inserted in this, the best Avenger movie yet."
" Yawn . . . wake me up when it is over
",0.0,-0.4894,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I'm not quite sure how I got to the end of this movie. I think that Black Panther was the only thing that saved me from falling asleep, being a childhood favourite superhero. His cameos were enjoyable thanks to nostalgia.The recipe for Captain America : Civil War seems to have been 1 cup American patriotism, 2 cups moral quandary we will forget about by the end of this movie, half a cup of explosions, a pinch of action and a sprinkle of superhero cameos. That action could've saved this film if there was more of it, but really the only enjoyable moment of this flick was the penultimate fight scene that appeared in every trailer. Everyone seemed to have lost their common sense for the duration of Civil War; characters deified their personalities and beliefs to support things that they'd never be caught dead doing in the past. And this is where the 1 cup patriotism was liberally stirred in, as we're told to choke down the idea that the governments of the world have any control over superhumans, aliens, magicians, genius inventors with arsenals of exploding gadgets and literal deities. Some of whom are the leaders of countries, dimensions or trillion dollar companies themselves. This follows the preceding film that involved just a small segment of your (not my) favourite heroes destroying the supposedly most powerful organisation in the world. We're also told to swallow those cups of moral quandary, about how awful it is that innocent people die when the heroes save the day. Ignoring the fact the planet would have been destroyed thrice over by now without them, it is hard to get the claim that the governments only care to do this now, after years of cities being destroyed (though to be truthful, rarely because of the heroes). Honestly, the plot was so bad it made me want to snore. But the fact that the action was sorely lacking in lustre most of the movie only helped hurt it. Tony Stark's attitude is just annoying at this point, and Captain America fulfills the stereotype of the jock, rushing off without a second thought, and nearly destroying many things in the process.I think we were supposed to peg this whole plot down to 'friendship is important', but sacrificing your freedom, other friendships and possibly the planet for someone you haven't seen for sixty years? Yeah right."

This movie makes a great sleep aid, I usually find the so called ""action sequences"" so dull you can pass out around 2 minutes into the flat unimaginative fights, and one liner joke that M.A.S.H. would be ashamed to speak out loud.Don't worry Hollywood, even added a ridiculously and pointless love scene so you can convince your ""partner"" you didn't go to see this so you could stare at man bulges. I guess this movie is good if your 5 year old is bored and you need a nap. Side note: nothing really happens for about 99% of the running time of the movie. So basically just skip to the last 15 minutes and you will be fine, the rest of the movie is just forgettable and unnecessary to watch. At least this Marvel movie has maybe 5 minutes worth of watchable content. GO MARVEL!!!"
