" Lack of plot, thought provoking concept
",-0.4767,0.8176,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"It felt like movie didnt really start at all. When starting position was set movie was already at 45 minutes. I would have hoped that there would have been more than just ""other vs. Us"" mentality, some plot to make things interesting. Even I as a viewer felt alienated from this family. This felt like empty experience, maybe this movie brought something new if you havent ever tripped away from mainstream thoughts."

" It's A Good Thought Provoking Movie For Viewers - Excellent Actors All Around
",0.7003,0.9317,2021-03-23 00:00:00,9,"03/23/2021 This movie stimulates viewers thoughts regarding their personal beliefs versus what the movie projects. I'm pretty sure that Jim Jones and his followers were sincere and committed, just as David Koresh and his Christian believers. Vigo Morrison's character refused all other forms of information and indoctrination that did not support his own slanted self serving version of life. Mid movie there were two of the most poignant words spoken in the film spoken by his youngest son, ""Dad's crazy"". And I definitely agreed. One of the later scenes shows the inside of their empty bus/motor home with Vigo at the wheel which truly symbolized the reality of many peoples finality of life - All alone with just a lifetime of memories. A good movie! Bon Appetit'"
" Chomsky's Useful Idiots
",0.4404,-0.2484,2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the scenery and the acting enough to finish watching the movie. That says a lot because it isn't uncommon for me to get soooo bored or sick of a movie that I have to speed it up or kill it. However, I did find it extremely ironic that Chomsky dedicated his book to Lucifer, aka Satan. This movie falls prey to his BS. It is also ironic that the ""power to the people. Stick it to the man."" slogan used by this movie crystalizes what useful idiots Chomsky turned people into, including Hillary Clinton. Think about it for a moment. What form or governance is ruled by ""the man""? Unquestionably the answer is communists regimes and ""Maoists"" lauded in the movie. The dictators rule and kill millions of the ""people"" in their quest to be ""the man"" in charge. Now contemplate what form of governance brings the most freedom and power to the individual ""people"". Yes, you are right, a representative republic."
" 10 for effort. 1 for content.
",0.0,-0.8625,2021-03-23 00:00:00,5,"The fact the family believes in the most inhumane, intolerant and violent evil beliefs while bashing everything ""Western"" is why this movie fails. If someone were indeed a Maoist, they wouldn't be that way at all. It's like author wants to throw in very anti-establishment philosophy possible without knowing what they mean or how somebody believed those things would act."
" Not Fantastic
",-0.4449,-0.6249,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"The thing I hated about this movie is the ""hero"" of the movie is also the villain. I assume the writer wanted us to fall in love with Viggo Mortensen's character, but he's a disgusting father who teaches his kids to commit crimes which they do three or four times during the movie. The dad also used very inappropriate language in front of his young kids.
Beware: this is a very anti-Christian movie."
" Nice, but a little too liberal as well for my liking
",0.7964,0.8438,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"I sort of like this movie, parts of it made me wish I was brought up with no internet and away from society. Anyway though I thought some parts of the movie were way too PC and unrealistic, but an ok watch nonetheless, and a very good idea."
" Marxist training film for the left
",0.0,-0.9134,2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,"Ben (Viggo Mortensen) claims to be open-minded to all points of view but openly ridicules Christians and finds Buddhism to be acceptable. He teaches his kids to be self-sufficient (a good thing) but also to steal, cheat and poach other people's property (definitely a very bad thing). In the end he turns them all into felons by illegally robbing a grave. If this is a morality play it is deeply flawed."
" Mind blowing. Different. Special. Meaningful.

Every moment is interesting. The story is special and has meaning. This is clearly a 10 movie to me. Everybody is good here. The bad guys are good. The good guys are a little bad. Points of view are argued on so many levels without degrading anyone. One thing we hopefully learn in our lives is that our parents are just kids that got a lot bigger and don't really know what to do. There is suffering and there is love.

" Idiotic
",-0.5574,-0.9124,2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,"Now if I see 8 stars on this site I immediately begin to doubt the quality of the movie. Movies have become so bad lately, and the taste of the mass audiencw has turned our to be so perverted that it is hard to find a good movie, and worse -- it is hard to trust many tinea that if people vote for a movie as good that it is actually good. That said in general the captain fantasy is mere bs -- a bring flick pretending to be deep. I was able to watch it till the outlandishly stupid scene with the cop scared by the nutty Christian-hating children when they sang to him a Christian hymn with bulging eyes. That was their ""training."" Who makes such crap and calls it a film?! More so, who watches it with a straight face and gives it 7 or 8 stars? Things are getting out of control in this world."
" Offering Poison in Honey!

For you to connect with nature you need to mock what other people believe is sacard, make sure to tell them how stupid and evel they are, especially Christians.
Feel good about hating cops for doing their job, and don't forget to despise capitalizim to become the ultimate woke worrier and win the Captain Fantastic title.

" Finding truth through juxtaposition.
",0.3182,0.4019,2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"To me this movie is about mental health. The protagonist (in Stanislavski terms) is not able to cope with her disease and does something that sets off a series of events culminating in a scene that involves a stainless steel toilet on an airport. The entire story, especially where her parents are involved, is a palimpsest of the truth. The truth is that mental illness is a serious medical disease that needs to be treated as such. The kids growing up in nature on one side and the suburban family and then later on the Lord and Father on the other side represent the two sides of her illness, The adventurous dad, the Mosquito Coast references, understandable, but it's what we don't see that makes this movie important."
" Any real Marxist would hate it
",-0.5719,0.9118,2021-03-11 00:00:00,3,"I've been reading the raving reviews about this film and I don't understand how I can feel so differently about it. I feel it's a total misinterpretation of the Marxist and Trotskyist ideas, which a wealthy family use for signalling heir virtue and intellectual superiority. It aspires in the film that the mother gave up her career in law to live in the Rousseau-dream paradise, yet the family float around leftists ideas borrowing them from the mainly urbanite proletariat. For me this was a film about how the right is hijacking the left which made me upset."
" Might be the greatest movie ever!

It reminds me of ""Into the Wild"" a little, but maybe better if thats even possible. Viggo and the kid actors were perfect! It really sums up modern day living and makes ya think."
" Full of itself and full of plotholes
",0.0,-0.9711,2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,"This movie has some redeeming qualities but for me it's watchability is completely destroyed by the constant plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the film. For example, the kids have lived in an isolated forest their entire lives yet the youngest son wants to know why they don't celebrate Christmas like the other kids. Why would you ever care about that if all you've ever known is your own special family holidays? The kids are reading Dostoyevsky and Trotsky and other extremely difficult books yet they've had no formal education and are only ages like 11-17. They claim to despise Christians yet when a police officer pulls them over the elder son somehow knows prayer and breaks out into a Christian song, I'm not sure how they would know that.There's so many more little things like this that constantly ruined my suspension of disbelief and peeved me. Maybe others aren't bothered by these flaws, but they seem so fixable to me. So many of the issues could have been avoided by minor dialogue changes, but somehow they didn't care or were missed."
" the idealism and strength made me cry
",0.4215,0.9832,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"I really feel for the protagonist, what courage and intelligence and idealism he has even if I'm not sure whether he was always doing the right thing or not. There are clearly holes in what he's teaching his kids. But, I connect with the main point of their message. I see that our world is not right. It is missing so much. But the inspirational part is that these people seem to have the will to do the work necessary to try to live better, something I don't have.
The work of raising his kids under these conditions especially all alone after losing his wife and the way he connects so deeply with his kids... I'm too old to be a father now, but when I thought about it when I was younger, I feel like the kind of commitment that he demonstrated to try to raise his kids right is what I would have wanted for myself. It's hard to put into words, but that is what brought some tears at a certain part of this movie. To the degree that he succeeded made me feel like he has the best kids in the world. Like, if there is anyone who could change the world for the better, they would come from this bunch."

This is the power of this movie. It reminds us that balance is what we should all aim for. No extremes whatsoever. Ben's character way of living is, ironically, only possible if the world he despises exists. Can you only imagine what it would be like if everyone in this world was living this way?"

On tomorrows lesson plan I put shark hunting and brain surgery. I have seen Disney Movies more believable than this one. A father, whose wife has been sick with bipolar disorder for around 18 years (right after the birth of the oldest son), not only managed to care for his wife, but also living in the wilderness while teaching 6 kids multiple languages, literature, game hunting, fighting, and, and, and. He acted like a dictator towards his kids and only followed his interests. He even ignored the grief of a father and a mother, only to get what he wanted. He acted like he believed in principles, but at the same time drilled his kids to rob a grocery store. This Movie did not make any sense at all and I can't believe the great ratings. Also, did Noam Chomsky sponsor that movie?"

Where problems exist is when other people believe there is one way to achieve this and that one way is theirs.For me this was the crux of this movie, what rights do others have to interfere in the environment you create for your children?There are strong arguments to mount from all sides, particularly in terms of child welfare.Personally however I tend to believe if you can't build your family how you want to then you have no freedoms at all.The movie is amazing, the cast delivers with such passion for the story that you easily get swept up in it."

There are a lot of thought provoking scenes and subjects that will make you sit on one side of the fence or the other, but I do think we have or should have explored all of these already. There is a lot to be said for going back to nature (off grid) but there comes a point (with 5 or 6 children) that this is not realistically sustainable for so many reasons, some more obvious than others. Nice effort but could have been better"

(He should have won the Oscar.) Now I'm hooked on all things Viggo. I'm looking forward to seeing him in the upcoming film Falling in which he plays a gay man with a nasty, abusive father (played by Lance Henriksen) who has dementia.

" good time
",0.4404,-0.9335,2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I found this movie to be well intended but filled with a bunch of conflicting views. Yes, homeschooling is awesome, however, it was also portrayed as letting the children end up with poor socialization skills, and they were left thinking that they don't know anything if it wasn't taught in a textbook. The characters were against fascist totalitarianism yet the oldest son (Bo) was a Maoist. How is Mao not the epitome of ""the man"" they so often talked about sticking it to throughout the movie? That the grandfather didn't do anything about the children going missing? But they all made it fine to fly out of an airport? There are way too many inconsistencies in the movie as far as political philosophy and ideologies. But I suppose if you are able to look past that (why they hell would you since it's core to the movie?) then I guess you will enjoy this. Positive was acting, the idea of the plot, and execution otherwise, but I'd be lying if it didn't irk me to no end that these fundamentals w"
" One of the best movies I have ever seen!
",0.6696,0.968,2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"As someone who regularly speaks against the propaganda pushed upon us by Hollywood, the government, the formal education process, and even the corporate church, I heard about this movie from sources I follow. Not having any knowledge of what it was about, my wife and I watched it last night. WOW! Great movie, AWESOME message, which is don't succumb to the propaganda, be as self-sufficient as possible, don't depend on others to educate your children, school them yourself! Some of us believe this lifestyle is the correct one, and would LOVE to be able to live like that! Only things I would add are that it was not a good idea to live isolated as a single family (hence the social development issues with the children), best to be part of a community of like minded individuals! Not a big fan of the corporate ""church"", but I believe in and have a personal relationship with God, so have issues with the Buddhism portrayal as well. And I really did not need to see Viggo naked! :)"
" Fantastic but has a few flaws
",0.3182,0.4373,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie about a father who is raising 6 children in the wild and the various parenting choices that he has to make along the way. At some point, every parent has to make certain difficult parenting decisions, but our protagonist here has clearly taken this to the next level. He trains his kids really well but realizes, like every parent on the planet, that he may not have all the answers after all.
It is hinted that the reason behind this alternative lifestyle was the fact that his wife had bipolar disorder and they decided that perhaps going back to nature might serve her very well. However, after the birth of their last child, she developed post-partum depression, which made things worse. The suicide of his wife is an eye-opener for him, so is the fact that his children are questioning his beliefs and are low on social quotient. When his daughter gets hurt while on one of their missions, he starts to reevaluate everything.
The movie has a great premise and there are many superb moments in the movie. The cinematography and acting are both first rate.
This is exactly my kind of movie, but what kept me from giving it all 10 stars was the fact that while trying to shun the normal conventions, this film takes a very extremist viewpoint and ends up being equally intolerant of other ideas. Teaching kids to steal can never be justified even of you were trying to 'stick it to the man'! I can live with the fact that they somehow had enough money to buy the forest land and were all practically multi-talented geniuses, but I still feel that the ending could've been a bit stronger. Now, I realize that in real life also, we hardly know what's right or wrong, but once the gauntlet had been thrown, I wanted the film to rise up to the challenge. However, even though it did fall short, it didn't do so by a huge margin and is therefore, a funny and thought provoking film. Makes me very glad that I watched this!"

" The difficult issue of how to relate to a suicide in the family
",-0.7906,0.9933,2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"They are six children and one father. Where is the mother? She is gone and will not come back, but she is in agreement with the fact that he has to bring them up alone. They have left society and live freely in the realm of nature, he training his children to survive in wilderness and manage their lives in social independence and freedom, also educating them freely and teaching them to read any books and languages - they know french and German among other languages. They manage all right although shut out of society, his father-in-law promising to have him arrested if he tries to come to his wife's funeral with his children. She visits him in his dreams and calls him Captain Fantastic, entirely endorsing his and his family's way of life. Yet this is no hippy narrative but rather an interesting experiment of existentialism, their guru being Noam Chomsky.
Viggo Mortensen makes a fantastic performance as the father, but also the others act marvellously, especially the children and Frank Langella as the grandfather, who plays a very important role. Above all, it's an immensely beautiful and endearing film with all the lovliest landscapes of Washington and New Mexico, and it gradually develops into a drama of a funeral. There is much philosophy as well, as the deceased was a Buddhist wih very determined views, which have consequences. The music is also quite interesting, as their favourite music actually is Bach, but there are other tunes as well. I guess you could ultimately after all call it something of a modern hippie tale, but it is very serious and philosophical which must result in considerable afterthoughts and discussions. The film which comes closest to mind, as some kind of a distant relative, is actually Agnes Varda's ""Le bonheur"" about 50 years earlier."

" Just because you don't agree with society doesn't mean you have to live outside of society
",-0.2755,0.9306,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,Captain Fantastic is a movie that shows that not everything is binary. Not everything is black or white.The movie opens with typical anti capitalists benefiting directly from capitalism. We know this from 2 main examples. 1. At one point they go to a bank and withdraw money meaning the father has a bank account. 2. Later in the movie the father explains how he ended up living in the woods. We learn he and his family were living on a farm that they sold to purchase land in a forest. So anyone who has ever bought land especially desirable land knows that it is quite expensive. Which means he has money. You could argue that his wife has a rich father and maybe that is how they were able to afford the land. Either way they are still directly benefiting from capitalism all while talking about how evil capitalism is. This is very typical of anti capitalists. The fact is that capitalism allows them to live their lifestyle.And I believe that they learn this in the end as it shows him sending his kids to school. In other words he kind of accepts that in order to function you need to follow at least some of the rules.There is a reason we do the things we do in this society. There is a reason we have organized religion and government education and shopping malls where you can buy anything you could ever want. To completely remove yourself from all of these things is a mistake. But at the same time to blindly follow everyone else is also a mistake. You need to balance your life and make decisions based on what you believe to be true. Because everyone says their way is best but only you can decide what's best for you.

Mortensen (Green Book) plays Ben, a father who lives in the wilderness with his 6 children and teaches them how to survive/adapt. Soon, his wife, Leslie (Trin Miller) commits suicide and they try to attend her funeral despite her father,
Jack (Langella) who doesn't like Jack very much. Ben tries to decide if his philosophical values/examples are best for the children or if they should adapt to the modern world instead. This is a good family drama with a bit of humor, nice scenery/settings and Mortensen is not only great, but this is one of his best I recommend."

" We Should All be a Little More Fantastic
",0.5595,0.986,2020-11-19 00:00:00,9,"I am so thrilled to have come across this movie. Viggo is one of my favourites, and he is so good in this as he is with all his roles.What a deep look into perspectives and philosophies. Ben (Viggo Mortensen) firmly believes life should be lived a certain way. I respect and admire that. In so many ways I am envious of him. The first third of the movie it would seem the children are destined for greatness with how smart and physically fit they are. Though, the remainder of the movie exposes that they may not be entirely prepared for how the ""real"" world is, as unfortunate as that is. Ben's idea of an ideal life for his children is not quite so picture perfect. Corporate America, and the everyday life of an average American has it's flaws, which Ben likes to point out, but not necessarily make fun of. He just doesn't want that for his children, though his own philosophies are proven to be somewhat flawed at their core as well. That's why I don't think it's a good idea to go to the extremes as Ben and his family go to at the beginning, but find a sort of middle ground as it would appear they do at the end.This most definitely deserves a high rating merely for its thought provoking ideas, but it is also wildly entertaining. There are several things that I don't necessarily agree with Ben in this film, however after watching, I also feel a desire to be much more Ben like. It gives a feeling of wanting to live a better and fuller life. That's why I think everyone should take the time to watch this film, especially if you're a parent."
" An emotional rollercoaster, a critique to modern society and to capitalism. A phenomenal cast composed by skillful actors
",0.1531,0.9643,2020-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Captain Fantastic is one of those rare movies that got me emotional and made me think. It is one of those small gems that more people should watch and appreciate. There are many topics and elements that are perfectly mixed together, conveying an important message in the end. It is a slow burner, especially at the beginning, but this give the opportunity to the audience to really understand the context and to know protagonists of this story. Characters are deepen in every aspect: we get to know how they think, which is their psychology and their life philosophy. Viggo Mortensen nailed as a leading character. He plays the father of six, he decided to live with his family far away from the modern society, in a forest, he home school them, he trains them and even if he is clearly inconsiderate and maybe even a little bit naïve, he clearly loves them. Their small universe crumble when they discover that their mother died after months of suffering due to a mental illness, and this is the exact moment when an emotional rollercoaster begins. The family decide to go to the funeral, leaving the bubble that this father built for them, and confront the real world. Adversities will rise and the relationship between them will change.The movie wants to be partially a critique to modern society, and bad habits that we inherited, such as the excessive usage of technology that deteriorated human relationships, the consumerism that pushed to always buy new stuff, even if we don't really need them. Yes, most of us live the good life, by having all the comforts, but at what cost? Maybe we lost real human connections, we forgot what it means to really immerse ourselves in the nature and appreciate what surround us. But from the other side the movie clearly show that living in our own bubble, without understanding the world around us, can be actually dangerous, because we don't know how to approach it. This concept is very well expressed by Bodevan, the older brother.These are just a few stuff that hit me the most, but there are so many valuable lessons here.

Studying astrophysics, literature, philosophy, politics, etc. in between combat and weapons training, conditioning, farming, hunting, learning numerous languages, etc. Implausibility aside, there is lots to say about modern society, but you won't get it from this movie, which dumbs it down so that it can bludgeon you with the observations. I mean, most of the accessories they used would not be possible without the evils of modern society. Maybe that was the point, that the father's ideals were naive. The true conversations about the ills of modern society are far more complex and nuanced."

In LNT this leads inexorably to a heartbreaking conclusion.

" Matt Ross' Sophomore Effort Elevates Education
",0.0,0.9872,2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"Viggo Mortensens shines here before his seminal role in Green Book. It is his second Academy Award lead actor nomination. All the actors, young and old are very good as an ensemble cast. The real star however is Matt Ross who writes and direct a complex tale of exploring the limits and merits of thinking and actually living differently. His views on education, religion, death, humour, honesty, consumerism, entertainment, sex and nudity are very interesting and challenge the accepted social norms.The film explores a father's quest to elevate the lives of his children with love, knowledge and deep awareness, yet who is confronted with the clash of this idyllic utopia with the harsh realities of the cold world.Filled with humour, sweet and smart moments, the movie shines and reminds me of some of Little Miss Sunshine (2006) with much deeper and relevant themes. The scene where ""Noam Chomsky Day"" is put against the attractive fairytale of Christmas as a child's point of you is poignant not only in the screenplays powerful points and messages but even more so in the family dynamic of openness and truth-seeking instead of accepting half-baked perpetuated ideas or stroking egos.Another unforgettable scene is when the dad storms the church during a ceremony and makes an epic, no BS and relevant speech that rings true and ""sticks it to the man"". Enjoy this philosophical whimsical tale of the level of parenthood we should all hold ourselves accountable for."

Stick it to the man!""The life shown out in the wilderness is beautiful but heavily idealized, which was a detractor for me at first, but I loved how we gradually see just how flawed the father is. As much as I loved his worldview and his blunt honesty with his children, we can clearly find truth in some of his loathsome, affluent father-in-law's points, which is to the film's credit. The film gets a little cheesy in how it plays out, but it was really nice to compare the authenticity of the cremation scene with the phoniness of the earlier church service, and hear the father's final words of advice to his eldest son (starting with ""When you have sex with a woman, be gentle and listen to her."") The anti-religion, anti-corporation, anti-materialism type themes were all wonderful, even if the film lacked a little in its artistry. Fine performances from the kids in the cast too, led by George MacKay (the eldest son) and Samantha Isler (""Sweet Child O' Mine"")."
" Excellent film about the pros and cons of detaching yourself from modern society
",0.5719,0.8573,2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Captain Fantastic is a film about Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six children who are living in the wilderness, almost completely detached from modern society. The children have been taught to hunt, forage and live off the land, but also to read, debate and think way above their years. In the words of the children's mother, Leslie (Trin Miller), they are growing up to be philosopher kings. But then this idyllic paradise of theirs gets shattered when Leslie dies and they have to leave in order to attend her funeral in her once hometown.The film's views on modern Western way of life is rather critical, but it also softens this argument by presenting Ben's solution as problematic. The children are all precocious and well-read, with the physical capabilities of Olympic athletes, but they're also naive and ill-suited to make it outside their woodland home. This is most prevalent in Bo (George MacKay), the eldest of the children, who's on the cusp of manhood and most ready to leave and spread his wings. The only problem being that he has very little idea about how to socialize with someone who cannot discuss university level social philosophies with him.The family's journey into modern society has its ups and downs, its laughs and sorrows. It is very humorous when it needs to be, mostly at the expense of modern society and its foibles, but it's also a poignant look into the problems of modern day consumerism.That being said, the film's last third is problematic. Or at least not told as well as the first two thirds. It's almost like the film ran out of time and suddenly rushed into a happy ending, while completely forgetting, sidelining or outright ignoring many of the problems and conflicts introduced earlier in the film. Ben's personal journey into realizing that he may have gone just a teeny tiny overboard with his escapism is also tied off a bit too neatly for it to feel realistic.Still, it is a fine film to watch. Its premise and ideas are rather extreme, but they're also thought-provoking and interesting to watch. The ending could have been better, a lot better if we're being honest, but even then I'd recommend it."

" A movie that promotes looting and religious intolerance.
",0.34,0.6858,2020-09-03 00:00:00,1,"Captain Fantastic is essentially propaganda. In short, it is aboutbthis family who rejects civilized society, so they decide tomlive in the wilderness where the father indoctrinates his children to worship communist dictators like Pol Pot and Mao Zedong, because America and Western Civilization are bad. They have some income by selling crafts in a local stores, and probably those buters are the same working class Americans they detest.In the movie, the villain is the grandfather. His crime is being rich and Christian (in the movie, the characters show disrepect only to Christianity, not to any other faith). So they prove that being a communist in a Capitalist country is wonderful (I wonder why don't they prefer being communists in a Communist country?).Those kids are so brainwashed, that even when the father tries to show how free thinking they are (like when quoting the Bill of Rights), all they know is parroting the father's bias. There is no space or freedom for dissent in that family.I think this movie exist just to encourage people to be refolutionaries while enjoying all privileges that their parents credit card can provide. Jf you are a far-leftist, you will love the movie, but if you work for a living, you will probably be insulted."

" Ideology Impossible
",0.0,0.9938,2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Captain Fantastic (Matt Ross, 2016) fascinates from the start. He is fierce in criticism and delicate in family relationships that presents, which is one of the aspects that most shapes the long towards a distance of simple feelings. Following the delicate treatment and please do not confuse delicacy with weakness, the film is mounted on a large rudder shown in each scene. It is as if they say: what are you doing with the life you witness all the time? What have you done to the animal that is in you? Did it take how much false morality to erode the child that once existed in your body?Given these questions, I can say that captain fantastic is a difficult work to watch. It is worth mentioning that I refer to truly watching, donating the senses in the 118 minutes that make up the feature, since this way it is possible to perceive how much it can get to hurt in a directly proportional way to the lifestyle that the spectator and the spectator have led, because it is very likely that this style is criticized, or at least certain characteristics belonging to it. In view of this, here can be noted an excellent structure of the script developed by Matt Ross, because the disapprovals that are made by the characters and simultaneously forge the traits that relate to each other and the environment in which they are, are not directly conducted to the daily lives of and viewers, but to the system experienced by them.However, the film becomes too idealistic and somewhat extremist in its ideals, being therefore practically impossible to be applicable in reality, which can transmit a certain bitterness or bittersweet inspiration during and especially at the end of it, something that the film Glass Castle (Destin Crettonthe, 2017), which follows similar lines of plot, does not commit. Of course, I must point out that the fact that Glass Castle is a work based on Jeannette Walls' memoir must have been the main stronghold for the film to have been conceived with an enormously more realistic tone when compared to Captain Fantastic, which, however, does not disqualify either of the two feature films.Finally, it is necessary to watch many and many times Captain Fantastic, since he was not produced just to entertain in such a way that, if you are seeking only entertainment, the film will possibly disappoint you. It offers much more than an easy skiing fun; In fact, it recalls the infantile spontaneity in the step that unmasks with ease how much the life of supposed civilizations manifests an infinity of duties and rules that have been and are imposed even if they do not make the slightest sense for those who learn to perform them as machines, besides, of course, teaching them promptly to the next generations.In short, Captain Fantastic is a corner to life. It is something like the strongest condemnation of everything that prevents it from germinating. Being not only beautiful to feel, but also fertile to affect, she masterfully manifests values that have been neglected for a long time. It expresses that barbarity is not in starting to act like other animals, in fact, barbarism is in the abyss that now separates us from the possibilities of being animals, that is, of practicing the primordial condition of life, which is the simplest of all: to live. This is how the film tells its story by demonstrating the possibilities of contemplating the birth and death that we practice spontaneously at each moment, transforming creatively and coexisting in symbiosis with other organisms. Difficult task, I have to admit. However, it is something that is still worth fighting for.""I try all the time in this institution. And I pray, oh my God, as I pray.

" 10/10 An Instant Classic
",0.0,0.9992,2020-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Story - 9/10 pros: this is a very touching story of a father doing his best to raise his children as he sees best (albeit not a way the average american might agree with). It's a really touching family tell that dives into the complexities of love and protecting the ones you love. cons: there's not a lot to dislike here. it's one of the better stories I've seen in a while. Maybe it forces a hipster forest feel just a little at times.Cast - 10/10 pros: The ensemble cast is perfection but George MacKay is the the true standout. Viggo Mortensen is wonderful as the struggling father trying to keep his family together, but MacKay continually steals scene after scene. But yes the entire cast is brilliant; there is even a wonderful cameo of sorts from Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn (weird that their last names are so close) that they are brilliant in as well.
cons: no cons, here, cast is the star of the show. Maybe there's some believability factor here because the entire family is very good looking and perfectly hipstered groomed for a family living in the forest on their own.Direction - 9/10 pros: Writer/Director Matt Ross brilliantly weaves this touching family story together. He develops every character. Out of a family of 7 with 6 kids, he manages to make each character feel separate and distinct and always with purpose. He brilliantly walks the line between eccentric comedy and heartfelt drama without hesitation.
cons: again maybe he pushes a hipster feel into this family for comedic relief that can feel a bit forced.Pace - 9/10 pros: the movie checks in at just under two hours, but never feels slow or like a scene is wasted. Again with a family of seven, Ross uses every minute of this film to develop the characters, eccentricities, and insecurities of these family members. It takes it times and makes the audience fall in love with this unusual family.
cons: maybe some of the flashbacks to the mom seemed a little forced? again don't have too many cons for this movie.Atmosphere - 10/10 pros: the tone and atmosphere the filmmakers create is top notch. The costumes provide a fun sense of quirk and color to the film. The photography is very beautiful and helps accent some truly brilliant performances by the ensemble cast while always providing a clear geography with often very full cast oriented scenes. The music slides by in the background, and delivers one of the most powerful moments of the movie when the family celebrates a fond farewell to their mother; this scene is the personification of the movie and if it doesn't make you cry or feel happy or sad or some sort of strong emotion, then something is wrong with you.
cons: loved the atmosphere of this movie.Overall Score 10 out of 10, an instant classic"
" A Perfect 10!
",0.6114,0.989,2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"Rating: 10I absolutely love this movie. It is so beautifully written. A fun fact the movie received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes. I came across this movie as it was listed in the Comedy-Drama genre but the comedic bits in this movie make up only 20 percent of the film. The rest is just heartfelt and emotional. I couldn't help but just bring a teary smile while watching this movie as it is so brilliantly written.The Good - The soundtrack, the cinematography, the storyline and the cast of the movie is fantastic. They each portrayed a different personality while being connected at the same time. I like the concept of the film which heavily relies on raising a child via experiences and not textual knowledge. Although this might be frowned by a lot of parents it's just a different way of raising a kid. I like how the movie portrays the negative of being secluded too, like you are missing out on daily life. The movie is quirky and slips away from the mainstream.The Bad - If I had a bad for this movie I wouldn't rate it 10. The movie is beyond what I expected, I am so glad I came across this movie by luck. I guess that is the only bad. I would want this movie to be promoted to a broader audience.Viggo Mortensen and the rest of the young upcoming stars make this movie a must watch."

That might sound funny or stupid. But just think about how healthy that is. They don't even have cell phones. Or T.Vs they all read books ever night. Plus they all play music.

" I just love this film.
",0.6369,0.9945,2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie has made me think quite a lot about all things that really matter in life. I recently just became an educator, and like any beginners into the field, I had idealistic views on how children must be taught, too, and about what really the essential skills to learn are. As I went on with my idealistic views backed up by theories of people--mostly dead--I began to feel frustrated because it isn't how it is in the ""real world"" especially that the practices being done at schools now are mostly ideas of people who won history over--and we never questioned that (well, we did. But only did a little). And this film. This film is just different. It isn't a cliche story about cliche topics on life. The things discussed here are real matters. It makes you want to question things and just think about how much we are missing, how much we've went on in life without looking back at past practices that were instictively ours that could've been developed and useful if given the opportunity to. This talks about the uncommon perspective of taking the road not taken by many. This movie teaches you about taking risks, and of being firm with whatever principle you have about life without of course, closing doors to intellectual discussions and sensible arguments. This gives you a different take at the usual lifestyle of people, and life in general. To be honest, it was quite disorienting when two worlds were contrasted in one frame--that of theirs and their aunt's family. As most of us would, we would really find the aunt's argument more practical and relevant in this world, (and I commend the movie for realistically showing that as well, because we're not talking about the ancient Greece here and the time of Socrates and Plato; we're talking about that kind of lifestyle adapted in the modern goddamn 21st century) but the movie didn't fail to turn our heads to that other side--to what could be. Overall, I just love this movie. Great cast, great acting, great plot (come on, just put in all the elements of drama). There are many good philosophical views shown in this movie, too!

2) When the lead family meet their other relatives in 'normal society', those characters are all very unlikable too! Also, there are 3 teenage boy characters in the film and they are all insanely annoying

""Captain Fantastic"" plays some of it's themes too safe - and to a great detriment. While the emotionally driven tale of a father going all in on manifesting his ideals through his own children while caring for them as deeply as a parent could is truly inspirational and did brought a tear to my eye, the canvas it is painted on - mainly the idea of a family structured like a hippyish commune - falls short for me. I do like the concept, but the execution is really surface-level and feels like a pseudo-intellectual facade rather than a genuine, thought-out message. Far-left-leaning, self-sustained, somewhat anarchistic and deeply spiritual nature of Ben's ideology is displayed mostly through cliches, such as: ""McDonald's is bad"", ""Wealth over needs is a waste"", ""Best present for a 4-year-old is a tactical knife"" (that's a spicy one) and so on. When the movie actually goes somewhere questionable (like the toilet or the grocery store scenes) it makes sure to soften edges with good ol' family laugh. It is most recognizable in how Chomsky is brought up what feels like 20 times in 2 hours without once giving any real substance to the reference. Again, I really like the idea, but at the same time I'm almost sure that this approach will end up in a quick Google search and skimming an eye along the first sentence of Noam's wikipedia page, followed by closing the tab - all without pausing the movie. When you present characters that are in conflict with the world because of their ideas, said ideas should be explored and questioned - by the characters themselves or the viewers. Salinger, for example, does an excellent job at both with something like ""Franny and Zooey"". Captain Fantastic does too little of either.What it explores well and plenty, albeit predictably, is internal conflict, even hinting at some unsettling signs of ones to come. Needless to say, Viggo Mortensen and George MacKay do a great job at bringing to life interesting (forbidden word!), emotional and relatable stories prepared for their characters, and the portrayal of painful childish rebellion is executed nicely in Rellian. But it was also intriguing to see how Vespyr expresses too much devotion to the father figure, probably unable to act on her own, or how little Zaja is almost antisocial in her cold intelligence - foreshadowing of future struggles, surely.The story is done in a really basic fashion, with some abrupt pacing near the end of the runtime and loose ends, but it's actually structured quite well and doesn't feel like something heavily emphasized on anyway.I didn't really find the soundtrack attention grabbing, but it was amusing and fits it's place right. The one thing I certainly wished to be more expressive is the cinematography: most of the camerawork seemed really bland and primitive to me, with only a few scenes standing out as something interesting in that department.Overall, the movie was quite an enjoyable experience, but it lacked courage to actually challenge the viewer with it's provocative themes, while also being somewhat short on artistic expression in the most important movie aspect - cinematography. It belongs near that pile of light-hearted emotional Christmas movies you would watch with your family or close ones on a holiday, but it does not deliver anything else to be recognised for."

Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his large family live off grid, seriously off grid. Out in the wilderness, catching food, learning to fight. Slightly odd to our eyes, or mine at least. Throw in Ben's insistence on the children's education, reading books about quantum mechanics and we've clearly got an usual family dynamic. They're like liberal arts intellectuals that can skin a deer. A happy bunch, it's hard not to admire them. They seem self sufficient, but you know a spanner is coming. As we join them, Mum has been gone 3 months and counting and trips into the nearby town to collect post, offer up disruptions that can't be washed away in a waterfall... pretty cool way to have a shower though. One such trip into town brings utter devastation, both hidden and obvious and threatens to change their world forever. It's news of their mothers death that kick starts a chain of events that forces them to interact with a society they've grown up to despise. The loss of their mother adds an obvious strain and some the tough love reality gets a bit tough to watch at times, as Ben is very direct in his explanations of the world to his children. This is compounded too be distant in the ranks. Young Rellian is becoming disillusioned with his enforced slightly hippy exhistence. He's questioning. Wiser than he first appears and his added disruption will fuel the fire, but ultimately quench it too. There's a definite thread of who is really teaching who. It's funny too though, with Ben's matter of fact explanation of the birds and the bees and the child's observations regarding fat Americans. The children are well behaved through, ""We don't make fun of people... except Christians"". It takes on a road movie feel as they travel for the funeral. This throws up multiple interactions that test their family bond and the children's understanding of the world. It's not just the children at odds with the world though, they're open, excepting, adaptable. It's Ben who struggles, prejudiced against society and his father-in-law, the excellent Frank Langella and his plan for his daughters burial, against her Buddhist wishes. Here is where the wheels come off. As Ben, used to being in control, finds himself powerless as events transpire against him. There's a rather brutal twist I wasn't expecting, as Ben admits defeat. For all the right reasons, but it grates, even with the gorgeous Sigur Ros soundtrack. If I have a reservation, it's this, but that's really nit picking as there's very little here to dislike. Not all the children get centre stage, in fact I forgot to do a head count as to how many there are, let's say half a dozen, that's close enough. George MacKay as Bodevan (they all have unique names) is front and centre through. The eldest son, he finds himself courted by some of the top universities in the country, but for all his intelligence and free thinking, is he suited for the transition to structured society. It's the ticking bomb for much of the film as he hides his academic success from his father, knowing he would disapprove of such institutions. A film like this I guess demands a finale and it indulges, with some inevitable graveyard liberation and a touching goodbye to their wife and mother. Complete with the most bizarre rendition of Sweet Child O'Mine I've ever heard. It's a satisfying end to an unusual film. A film that's gentle and severe in equal measure. Intriguing and entertaining. Maybe even fantastic."

There were several big plot holes that completely uproot the second half of the film and the closing scene seems to be looking for controversy rather than make sense.

" Sweet story with positive social commentary
",0.765,0.9605,2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"The best thing about the movie is the performances. Viggo Mortensen nails the role of the father in grief (for his wife), but trying to stay strong to keep giving his 6 kids the ""anti-system"" education he established with the late mother.The young performers sold me on them being different kind of kids, with alternative education, more inclined to critical thinking and enjoying knowledge in a way impossibly different than what the classical claustrophobic institutions achieve, and far from pop modern culture and typical city vices.The technical aspects like score and cinematography were fine, but they weren't the focus, like the story and the family emotions.The movie tackles the story from positivity, filled with sweet moments. But with this premise (""anti system""), modern society was going to take some hits (all deserved ones). Obesity, the poor educational system, empty consumerism and who owns the authority and why, are targets. After a while, the story starts commenting on the natural problems this different ideology creates in the kids too. And this is the part that it would've benefited the most with a more malicious, forceful direction, with more pronounced and strong denouncements of the system we so numbingly accept. Of course, that would make the movie much more harsh (and unwatchable for more conservative audiences).But this is the reason why I think the movie is not great. Too serious (and positive) to be a full on comedy that mocks ideologies, but not serious enough to be a movie with unforgettable social commentary either."

" A film with heart
",0.0,0.954,2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"I have often been told that a critic's view is the critic's view, make up your own mind. This can be difficult when films are limited on distribution and you rely on the word of one who is paid and has the opportunity to attend these films.Captain Fantastic was for me one of those films. Thankfully, the reviewer was one I trust and I am grateful for his guiding hand.For many - including my wife - Viggo Mortensen will always be Aragorn. Therefore watching a film which involves him being a hipster father of six kids, of broad age range, extolling a wilderness lifestyle can be a challenge. The film itself does not start easily. The reason for the family's isolation is not immediately explained nor is Viggo's fixation on readying his kids, through 'training' for a Marine type existence. Their father's home tutoring is also dictated to by their father and although free to think their educational base very much appears to be centred towards the left politically.All of this changes when there is a family death which once it happened seems to surprise nobody other than Viggo. And once he does come to terms with it finds reasons which at odds with the majority.The death leads to a road trip as the wilderness family head to the funeral. The kids become exposed to things that had previously been contained in books or completely hidden from their sight; love, capitalism, greed and most amusingly, family, but in a form that seems at odds with their own close knit nature.As the pot gets mixed and Viggo's grip on the family dynamic begins to loosen previously hidden truths come to the surface and even his own hidden guilt reveals itself as his realisation that what didn't appear broken was actually invisibly cracked in quite a bad way.If there is a message in the film it is that there are many paths that can be chosen in life, and if that path is shared by all whom you love that path does not always have to be the commonest of paths.Well worth a watch if you want to experience something not of the norm."

" Equally heartwarming & heartbreaking
",0.0258,0.9684,2019-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Right from the Lord Of The Flies-esque opening scene I was instantly hooked by this emotionally compelling film about a family's loss and societal integration or lack of it. Matt Ross' Captain Fantastic tells the story of the Cash family who have lived out in the middle of forest and mountains, living off the land for 10 years. When Ben's wife is taken mentally ill he has to raise his six children by himself. After hearing his wife has committed suicide he gathers his children and sets off on the road to the funeral against the wishes of his dead wife's parents.
Captain Fantastic is a heartwarming yet heartbreaking film in equal measure. Ross decides to inject humour throughout to lessen the blow with the heavy subject matter and it really works. I laughed out loud on many occasions but my eyes welled up on a couple of moving occasions too. There are many standout scenes but my favourite had to be when Ben and his kids break out into spontaneous song with their musical instruments around the camp fire. It was such an uplifting scene of togetherness it brought happy tears to my eyes. But this isn't really a comedy. Ross brings us serious social commentary on mental health, consumerism, religion, societal integration and the inadequate schooling system which are all effectively brought to the fore to create a thought provoking experience.
Stëphane Fontaine's cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, especially when in the wilderness. It made me want to go out there and join them, for a week at least.
Performances are all outstanding, the kids especially, but Viggo Mortensen knocks his turn out of the park yet again. Every emotion conveyed in those sad deep set eyes. He's fast inserting himself into my top 10 favourite actors list.
With a stirring and at time haunting filmscore by Alex Somers, Captain Fantastic is quite possibly the best film I've seen this year."

It made me think though.The story follows Viggo Mortenson as a devoted father raising his six kids off the grid in a forest in the Pacific Northwest. Their training is physically rigorous and highly intellectual, they often live off the land. After a tragedy the family embarks on a road trip to New Mexico where the kids are forced to interact with the outside world for the first time, challenging Dad's ideas of what it means to be a parent. As always Viggo does a great job, shows his penis randomly -I saw enough of that in Eastern Promises.The bus trip is interesting and entertaining, watching the kids fascination with the world. What's wrong with the people why are they all so fat? haha and then the cousins with their violent video games and lazy smart ass attitude. I felt sorry for Dad, he is so torn when Frank Langella (the father in law) wants to take the kids. I think ultimately they will tum out to be great adults, somewhere in the middle."

",-0.2732,0.9465,2019-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I believe no one else could have played the lead, Viggo Mortensen is incredible in this film. Kathryn Hahn is an amazing actress (even if she mostly does comedies) and overall acting is on another level (including secondary characters). Sometimes, the actors save the movie. In this case, I think they shine pushed by the hand of a smart director.What low critics don't get is that the movie is like a picture. A picture of something unique.
Any work of art should try to show something new to the world (otherwise why do it?).
Is it a unique story? I think so.
Also, imagine there's a picture of Hitler, you shouldn't judge the photographer or the quality of the shot simply by who or what the model is. A picture of a knife is not an apology of stabbing.
I bring this on the table because I think Ben, aka Captain Fantastic (a wink to the endless Captain America amount of movies) is also being heavily criticized in the script itself, in fact, if it ain't were for the colors used, you'd say it's an apology of 'follow the law word by word until you die'.I liked it because it is true to life.

This is a dramatic comedy which give a lesson about our life. We can see that the father gives a good and healthy education to his children, he teaches them to respect and to survive in the forest with hunt... Like that all the children are very intelligent even the girl who is 6 and who knows better the amendment than her olders cousins.
The parents teach them that the society is bad, they got ""missions"" like steal in the market to fight against the capitalism for example.
But at the end the father understands that this life is not ideal when his girl has a serious accident so they choose to live more like the others and the children go to school but they don't abandon their life.

" Mortensen Brought His A-Game With Him
",0.0,0.9987,2019-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Even though Viggo Mortensen will eternally be etched as Aragorn from ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise, movie fans will know that he is much more than a one trick pony. From making a name of himself as an Amish guy named Moses from the movie ""Witness"" to playing Leatherface in the 1990 third installment of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" he can tackle all kinds of roles be it big or small (like in ""Carlito's Way"" , ""Crimson Tide"" and Sean Penn's directorial debut ""The Indian Runner""). He is very capable of challenging himself in films under the direction of David Cronenberg (""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"") and being in a couple of Westerns (""Hidalgo"" and ""Appaloosa"") and finally put us to tears in John Hillcoat's post-apocalyptic tearjerker ""The Road"".A resume like that will surely get your attention but now after three and a half decades in the Hollywood industry, Mortensen's hard work has paid off here as he gives a performance of a lifetime in his Oscar-nominated performance in writer/director Matt Ross' ""Captain Fantastic"" which truly brings out the best in Mortensen.Ben Cash (Mortensen) has kept his family secluded in the Pacific Northwest away in the deep wilderness and away from technological outlets and society, but still has the knowledge in all important aspects in life like government, philosophy, literature and staying in shape. He and his six kids are very intelligent and his child nurturing has had a positive effect on them and are capable of engaging in debates and can solve advanced mathematical formula better than the engineers at MIT. When not trying to outsmart the intellectuals, the kids succeed to stay fit, like jogging, push-ups and hunting for game with more useful tactics than with a knife.The Cash Clan are in for an unpleasant surprise when they get the news that their mother, Leslie (Trin Miller) who has been hospitalized for many months after being treated for bipolar has committed suicide. Leslie's father Jack (Frank Langella) who wasn't fanatical about their free-spirited lifestyle goes against his daughter's last wishes by burying her instead of being cremated like she wanted. The Cash Clan hit the road to stop the funeral and along the way, they have their taste to the outside world but still manage to adjust to this new surroundings.The comical and the tragedy genres are both well equally proportioned. We laugh when the family try to cope with the ""real world"" and the efforts to adjust. And then we are in tears when Ben has to break the news about their mother's death. The film succeeds in keeping our interests as how the family is able to adapt to the newer surroundings and how they go about it. Mortensen is wonderful as a loving, caring and grief-striken father who cares about his children, though he never taught them about the world outside their settings. Their was a scene where Ben teaches Bo (George Mackay) how to hunt for deer only to realize later that there's a diner nearby selling hot dogs and milkshakes.The movie in a comical sense lampoons the weaknesses of society norms like the educational system and it choosiness towards those who are deemed eligible, while at the same time doesn't go far as to viciously attack it. And though Ben might have the supreme intelligence, it's not fully praised. There are still awkward scenes where Bo tries to acquaint himself towards a pretty girl named Clare (Erin Moriarty) around the campfire. The way the film has you thinking makes it all the more spectacular.With the wonderful performances from Mortensen and company (especially the Cash kids) and the wonderful direction from Matt Ross this is truly one of the best films of 2016."
" FANTASTIC !!!
",0.7359,-0.4194,2019-05-23 00:00:00,8,"So this movie tells us the story of a family who lives in the forest,here we discover a different way of life than us, these people are living with nothing, hunting in the forest, they are making their own culture, the children don't go to school but have an education transmitted by their father called Ben, they are intellligent, more than others children of their age thanks to their self-made education.
So we discovered that the mother was in an hospital, but she decided to kill herself because of several troubles disorders. So the story is the discovery of our society of consommation for a family who just wants to go to the mother's burial in order to respect her will to be incinerated. But it's going to be harder than it was planned,because of many doubts and questioning about the real efficiency of this way of life without contact with the society.For me this movie has a lot of qualities, we can feel the emotions of the characters with beautiful musics on the back, it's breathtaking and transmitting a lot of sadness. This is exciting to discover how some people live and how hard can be the transition from a ""savage life"" to the ""basic life"" of american people. But there are also bad aspects, some parts are quite boring, but in the globality it's a good movie"

I precise I'm not a film expert and I just saw it in class. To me the plot is too empty and the story doesn't progress. The start and the final scene are kind of the same : the family living out of the society. The film didn't catch me because I'm not attached to this kind of education and I just wanted the children to break with their father. I had the feeling this lifestye didn't fit with the children and their life was spoiled by it. I have nothing against the fact some people live in the nature out of the society but according to me the film doesn't tell it in it's positive way."

Finally, the family is confronted to the life in society and will change.Personally, I think that it's a good to show another way of life anticonformist because we tend to judge people living out of the society, differently.

Living in the nature is the best thing to do to understand the world, the real world : important little stuff that should be essential. (For example : ""to know how to navigate by watching the stars [...]"", said the father Ben to a person who thought it's a shame to live alone like this).The acting is really good and emotional.I advise this film, because it is not just a show. It's a beautiful amusing film, but this one makes you also think about your own way of life. A beautiful message."

This comedy shows us that there are many ways of life and every lifestyle has pros and cons.I really liked the fact that this family seems to be more clever and interested in knowledges, music playing or enjoying life in respect without stress than casual people who live in the classic society. It enables us to criticize our society and the way we judge people, lifestyles or habits without minding about what's really important in life.In a nutshell, I can say that the lifestyle the film shows can be difficult to get however it seems to bring so much happiness, comfort and mind pleasure."

Their life is an ideal life for them. They live outside the society of consommation, money and normal life. They are very happy, and childrens have a very good culture. They have even a better culture that peoplle who live with a normal life. This movie tells us that we can live without networks.

The family decide to come back to the society to make her funerals as she wanted them to be. It's the beginning of a crazy adventure with many plot twists and moving moments.In my opinion, it's a very good film because it criticises capitalism and the consumer society where we live in the XXI century. We discover that school isn't the only way to develop his knowledge and the importance of the ability and the physical condition in the daily life. But the producer successed to take part in the other point of view : it seems difficult to be totally out of the society of today and be only with his family doesn't prepare well people to have a social life, and it's an important point. School seems finally essential to develop his social life. It make us reflect about what is the best middle ground. It's a film for children and adults.To conclude, I liked this moovie despite the fact that I usually prefer stories treaten from a real story. This film prooved me the opposite."

This film has excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, editing and acting. The entire cast deliver superlative performances with Mortensen leading the way. It is by far the best performance of his versatile career. The plot revolves around the Cash family that are removed from society and live deep in the Washington state wilderness due to the parent's, Ben and Leslie, beliefs. There the children are schooled in all aspects of life including education, physical fitness, survival without technology and being one with nature to name a few. After the sudden death of Leslie who suffers from bi-polar disorder, Ben makes the difficult choice of introducing the family to society and civilization due to Leslie's father Jack insisting on a traditional funeral for his daughter. Ben wants to honor Leslie's wishes to be creamated, but eventually bends to Jack's threats and demands. This is what ignites a road trip to life. It is an incredible and difficult journey for all the characters involved as many secrets and desires are revealed. After the children are introduced to their grandparents, Jack and Abigail, they have to make the decision to stay with them or choose to continue life with their father. The ending is wonderful, surprising, heartwrenching and cathartic. This film is an outstanding examination of family dynamics and the willingness to change. It is unique, insightful, clever, funny, and memorable. It is an ingenious dramedy and an all around work of art."

" The film takes the easy way out
",0.4404,0.6409,2019-05-03 00:00:00,6,"Captain Fantastic has similarities with the 1986 movie , The Mosquito Coast.Both films feature obsessed father wanting to go off the grid and live a simple life with the natural world.Viggo Mortensen gives a sincere and earnest performance. He plays Ben who lives in a log cabin in the pacific northwest woodlands with his six children. It is a back to basics life away from the modern commercial world. His kids read books, hunt and co-exit with nature. Whereas their cousins play violent video games and watch television.When Ben's wife and the kids mother Leslie commits suicide due to her bi-polar condition. The family travel to her funeral arranged by her conservative and wealthy parents.Ben's father in law Jack immensely dislikes him and his way of life. He rues that day that his daughter fell for him.Ben and the kids sort of gatecrash the Christian funeral. Leslie left instructions behind of the kind of funeral she wanted and she was a Buddhist.Writer/director loves the offbeat lifestyle of Ben's family values. Jack is the antagonist here. As one of the grand kid's mention, he has so much land around his house, it is unethical.Yet I had a touch of sympathy with Jack. I did find Ben a bit of a jerk, a know it all, someone who insists the old way of living in the past is the best and if you do not like his way it is the highway. I think the audience could feel confused as to what Leslie really wanted. After all she was mentally ill and she helped her eldest son Bodevan to gain admittance to prestigious colleges.Ben loses his rag when he finds out that his eldest son applied behind his back to these colleges. Such an elitist act was an affront to Ben's ethos. So much for free thinking and as Bodevan retorts, he knows nothing about the real world as he grew up in a forest in some kind of hippy commune where he was home schooled and had little contact with outsiders.I think Captain Fantastic goes for an easy ride, it wants to avoid difficult issues. Ben is made to look like a quirky anti establishment hero. He is just another type of bully, not alt right, just alternative lifestyle. Jack was right, Ben did come into Leslie's funeral looking like a clown."

" Au Natural Whimsical Eccentric
",0.4215,-0.9923,2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Are there any spoilers in this review? It's impossible to spoil something that sets the standard for everything tainted. Captain Fantastic is an American freak show, it's so far left it might drag you into outer space. Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic), the father of a large family living off-the-grid, would agree that only calling it ""interesting"" would fall short. I call it honeycomb tripe, stomach lining that pretends to be food. Better to let 'Captain Fantastic' just be a 1975 Elton John album title.You don't have to be Christian to dislike how the film unnecessarily and unconvincingly complains about how bad Christianity is, because it only creates inconsistencies in the movie. For example, how is the singling out and negation of all of Chrisendom, compatible with the syncretistic (fusion) thinking of the Eastern Religions, which the family in the film embraces, along with Native American religions?Next, the movie's intended theme of individualism and off-the-grid living as a preference over free enterprise, a Jefferson vs Hamilton scenario with a nod to Jefferson, is out of sync with the philosophies that the movie presents as what the father (Ben) uses to base his childrens' indoctrinations on, namely Plato, the Bill of Rights and others.Good points were mentioned at times regarding the presence of excessive modern American corporate controls, prevalence of shopping addiction in our culture, video game addiction, the physical obesity of the well off, placing value in home schooling and natural foods, and even showing sympathy for unaware sheep by the end of the movie, though the presentation is often excessively talkative, coming off like a speech or pictoral homily in a religion of a man's own making instead of an authenticly filmed story, it's just rhetoric.Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic) the father of the family, practices nature worshipping as taught from American Indians, the son eats a heart of an animal kill as a rite of passage and decorates with things that look like Indian amulets. Individually, his family members were allowed to pick any religion for themself except Christianity. They are taught the 60s 'stick it to the man' mind set which is not necessarily bad depending on how or in what situations it is carried out. Asian or Eastern religions and thought are also favored along with American Indian. They oppose Western preachers but are preachy themselves. Ben thinks the Bill of Rights gives him the Right to plan a family trip around stealing food from farmers and grocery stores when he is an obviously capable person under no immediate handicap. His demeanor is presented cool on the outside, calm and collected, and has an answer for everyone and everything, while living in contrast to American norms.
The described behavior of Ben's suicidal wife and seeing several of his freakish children behave, suggest he does not really have the answers he'd like you to think he has. The father was hoping his wife's being close to nature, living like Indians, would cure her mental illness, but it did not. So there seems to be some admission, late in the film, that their 'dreamcatcher' plans had holes in it. The living daughters were depicted to be of very stable mood, the opposite of their dead mom whom we never meet. One of them, the youngest girl, maybe 1st or 2nd grade age, is straightforward, unrealistically smart and quick minded beyond her years, beyond anyone's years, and she's polite but with odd ideation, she made a Pol Pot shrine in a tree fort which is less of a surprise considering dad teaches with duplicity, that is to hate haters. She also liked to either wear a gas mask or a hat of an entire animal skin that includes its skull on top her head. Stronger yet are the frighteningly weird males. Ben's eldest son acts very naive and quirky when meeting a female his age and later told his dad he had raised freak kids. Later the same son travels to Africa on a whim. A younger son also seems unstable, he's rage prone and with constantly shifting loyalties. The father's kids don't always like Ben but in the end they don't betray him either. In general, all of the kids seem to know they are on stage, they do not appear natural, they come off rehearsed, and given the back-to-aboriginal theme, that is ironic.By the end of the movie, after some successes and failures when interacting with greater society during the trip for the mother's funeral, Ben has perhaps tempered his enthusiasm for his lifestyle, giving somber long looks in the mirror while shaving his grizzly beard, perhaps thinking of compromises, and probably having dread feelings of assimilation. As the movie progresses, beginning to end, the family home landscape switches a few times, moving from mobile rustic Teepee living toward a slightly more permanent rural American homesteading look with cheerful blue exterior house paint. The bus that was used to go to the funeral is transformed into a chicken coop. Maybe by the end the father is more even minded in our eyes but we do not get any living examples of this change. The family is still isolated in a rural house, that's all you are left with. I can't help but also think how that picture of life at the end, at least on the surface, reminds me of the self imposed isolation from the world of the monestaries and convents of Christians, groups that Ben supposedly abhors. Perhaps if his life was lived more like that kind of religious life, his wife would have lived longer. No similar admission, is ever made by the movie. The film expects you to think that Ben is an innocent and all of his troubles, all of his inconsistencies, are the fault of the wider society. At an earlier point in the movie, to prove this further, they disgrace a corpse by flushing its ashes down a toilet in a ritualized ceremony. Another time Ben shocks an elderly couple in public by standing nude while ridiculing them for their narrow mindedness. This lower than school bathroom humor is all this film offers to explain itself."
" A pseudo intellectual Marxist fairy-tale
",0.5106,-0.8764,2019-02-03 00:00:00,3,"Captain Fantastic is nothing more than hypocritical pretentious closed-minded absolutist drivel primarily designed to demean Christians, and anyone else who doesn't buy into their Utopian Marxist/individualist mindset.The movie spends a lot of time mocking ""Christian fairy-tales"" while actually being a concocted fable about how a schophantly devoted Noam Chomsky hippie and his mentally ill wife somehow managing to raise a super race of physically fit brainiac children who speak multiple languages without the hindrances of evil ""capitalistic"" technology or any help from the outside world. Talk about suspension of disbelief!There are many things that perturbed me about this film, but the dad's practice of brutal honesty (from his perspective), even when it came down to his wife's suicide or a child asking about sex/rape, was quickly exposed as contradictional hooey when he fakes a heart attack in grocery store while his brood of super rugrats exponentially lied with him in order to rob the place. One could say, that in his world view, lies are only bad from within the cult, but near the end of the movie, he tells his oldest son not to lie to anyone. So... Maybe it's a Mao thing?I almost sympathized with the part about ""rescuing mom"" from a burial against her wishes... but told my wife while we were watching it, ""If they flush her ashes down the toilet I'm gonna kick the TV in."" Needless to say, they flushed her down the toilet! With all of these amazing intellects, no one thought to say, ""Hey, is it wrong to flush mom where fat Christians pee and poop?"" Nope. One super brat said, ""Bye mom,"" as she swirled away.In the end, I gave this over-hyped tripe a 4 for good acting and cinematography... Oh wait! I almost forget. I knocked off a point for Viggo feeling the need to do a full frontal. While slightly amusing, it was utterly unnecessary... much like the entire movie."

Even a skeptic like me becomes quite attracted to the Utopian dream that the family is living in. Yet the writers made sure to delicately show the very obvious challenges that living in such a society will represent. Perhaps the only bit where I would have wished more variety was when the movie included people from the ""normal society"". If there would have been people from a balanced and well-rounded background that met the protagonist's family, the encounter would have been interesting to watch.Over the course of the movie it arrives at a pleasant conclusion, stating that even the most hard-headed and perhaps radical people can make compromises. And usually it is for the better."

I think the review of that book describes the father character in this movie too well. He is a terrible person, but because it is written as though he is the hero many people mistakenly have written reviews believing that he is. He is not."

But I've noticed the negative criticism from audience members, is more to do with a dislike of the characters and philosophy. That's perfectly fine. But my god, they're very well developed characters.I'll be straight with you. This is indeed hippie porn. It asks the hypothetical question, what if an extreme Marxist put his money where his mouth is, and actually stuck it to the man. The results are interesting, but there are also negative consequences as well as merits. Hence I'm a little amused that the negative reviews are mostly people saying the director is trying to intotrinate them with hippie philosophy.For instance. There's a scene where the family are having dinner with their cousins, and one of his sister in law's children asks how his wife died. He answers every question he asks honestly. This creates an awkward tention in the room, of colliding philosophies on whether children should be coddled from upsetting truths. While the scene is indeed amusing, it does have a consequence. He realised he crossed a line, as he was their guest, and it was inappropriate to make them feel uncomfortable in their own home. And that is the key to creating evocative stories, there should always be a consequence. And by consequence, I simply mean result('s).Humans are complicated and hypocritical, and I think people underestimate how self aware this movie really is. The children a highly intelligent, yet their social skills are non-existent. Again, consequence. His step father did indeed have an ethical high ground on the social wellbeing of his grandchildren, yet he spat on his daughters memory with a Christian burial despite her instructions in her will.Great movies don't prosaically answer ethical dilemmas with fully resolved endings. It's fine to judge the characters and their pretentiousness, but it doesn't negate a beautifully executed story. I think you'll find the devisive scores in the user review section to be a matter of personal distaste, with little constructive criticism to the actual film making.A movie made for everyone, is a movie made for no one."

Yes, homeschooling is awesome, however, it was also portrayed as letting the children end up with poor socialization skills, and they were left thinking that they don't know anything if it wasn't taught in a textbook. The characters were against fascist totalitarianism yet the oldest son (Bo) was a Maoist. How is Mao not the epitome of ""the man"" they so often talked about sticking it to throughout the movie?That the grandfather didn't do anything about the children going missing? But they all made it fine to fly out of an airport?There are way too many inconsistencies in the movie as far as political philosophy and ideologies. But I suppose if you are able to look past that (why they hell would you since it's core to the movie?) then I guess you will enjoy this.Positive was acting, the idea of the plot, and execution otherwise, but I'd be lying if it didn't irk me to no end that these fundamentals were butchered."

Surprisingly, the writer/director plays the big bad billionaire villain on ""Silicon Valley."" It deserves points for originality and authenticity.

not by his own choice mind you... but by his REBELLION against his fathers teachings.... now the father is not a bad guy.... he is just raising his kids to think for themselves...and choose their own path... but not without bias...to me this film was more about the kids than anything else.... even the oldest son who is supposed to be a man.. breaks down and cries to his DAD that he does not want to lose him, and get arrested.... yet the middle child is the one that defies his father, and sneaks out to stay with the grand parents... he even rebels against Chomsky day!!!i rated it what i did.. because even though i can see this dynamic.. it was placed as second to all the propaganda... all the weird suites and clothes... all the weird hatred for self.... i think the most immature was the Father.... but i digress now...not a bad film but not outstanding..... just average..."

When the news comes down that their recently hospitalized mother has passed, the hard decision is made to travel into modern society & deal w/the horrors we relish on a daily basis. Nothing new in terms of overall story since we have the in-laws enter the picture w/an axe to grind on how their son-in-law has reared his brood which runs contrary to their beliefs & the eventual betrayal which comes as some of children rebel against their current living status. Written & directed by Matt Ross (he played a closeted Mormon leader on Big Love) w/wonderful leeway given to the actors as they explored their characters in depth & a nice use of naturalistic settings, Ross has established himself as a talent to be reckoned with."

Original story, combined with good performances and beautiful cinematography makes it a pleasant watch.The majority of negative reviews I read here berate the father (Ben) and his ideology towards tutoring his kids and life in general. And while I do agree with the majority of these claims, It didn't deteriorate much the overall experience watching the film.Yes, Ben's character is an ultra idealistic father, despising the society and raising his kids to be superhuman. However, his (and his children's) skills are so exaggerated that I couldn't take it too seriously. Moreover, although the movie bears ideological line that it might want to pass to the viewer (and this sparks a lot of controversy), it is quite superficial.To sum this short review up, if one won't focus on the ideological side or the characters' rightness / wrongness, one will enjoy all the merits the movie has to offer: Solidly constructed plot, acting, cinematography, scenery, characters and all the funny situations and encounters they have."

" A really, really interesting film. See it!
",0.5519,0.9976,2018-08-25 00:00:00,9,"A movie like this gives you a deep level of interest and satisfaction that no action flick, rom-com, horror movie, or other genre effort no matter how good can do. Captain Fantastic is not easily categorized as a comedy, or a tragedy, or any other single thing really. The themes are life, family, parents and children, education, society, and personal character all expertly interwoven into a thoroughly absorbing story. Too bad more people didn't see this.(First off, I have no idea what the film title means. It's got no relation to any kind of fantasy or superhero themes.) Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, who along with his wife Leslie (Trin Miller) has raised a family of five kids totally by themselves in remote Washington state wilderness. Ben and Leslie are late-era hippies: dropouts, yes, but dropouts with a mission that in many senses is harder to do than just staying within society. They are adamantly dedicated to staying away from the ""real world"" that is dominated by shallow pursuits and corporate greed; their kids are home-schooled and given the best mental and physical education they can make for them.But then Leslie falls terminally ill and Ben and their kids travel south to attend her funeral and meet the relatives they have never seen before. At this point, the story becomes a road movie, with some predictable happenings but much that is surprising too. Some of it is sad, some of it delightful. Frank Langella has the rather thankless task of playing Leslie's father Jack, a rich businessman with conventional attitudes who eventually wants to take the kids away from Ben and 'normalize' them. Jack does, in a way, care about his grandkids but his ethos and his methods are bull-headed. And at this point, the road movie becomes a heist whose outcome you don't see coming. To put it briefly, the five brothers and sisters go through some bumps in the road, but in the end they show a deep loyalty to themselves and the ideals given to them by their parents that isn't shaken by encounters with the outside world, and they act accordingly, all together. When they meet their worldly cousins, it's the cousins who end up looking like fools.Viggo Mortensen is the headliner, and he's great, but the kids end up being functionally the stars of the story. They are gems, all five of them -- beautiful in mind, body, and spirit. The dialogs among them and their father are endlessly fascinating; none of them know what's supposed to be ""appropriate learning"" for their ages, so they learn everything with their parents' happy encouragement, and if they have questions about anything at all (sex, politics, physics, economics ... you name it), those questions get asked, and their father answers them straight-on. The kids have an inbuilt self-esteem that is the result of hard-earned competence and widespread knowledge, not the superficial betrayal of constantly being told that they're 'special'. What impresses you most is their simplicity (not the same as naivete), openness, and honesty of character, and a kind of deep-seated calmness that we see all the way to the end. And there are books around, all the time. Lots of books, of every kind; aside from wilderness survival skills, those are the only things that Ben and Leslie thought were worth keeping from the ""real"" world.At the end, Ben and his family have reached a new accommodation among themselves and the outside world and the conclusion is very satisfying. Ben won't be seeing them all day long any more, but there are no doubts that the kids will be all right."

The acting, cinematography, sound editing, and directing all prove that this is a outstanding film. More people need to be aware of this movie. As an avid movie fanatic I strongly believe that this movie should be recommend to people of all ages. Viggo Mortensen shows true depth of what humanity is all about. Life changes, behavioral attitudes, and aspects on life are all displayed from start to finish. If you are looking for a refreshing take on humanity and a wonderful movie watching experience, then this title is for you. 10/10 all of the way."

" This outstanding family drama is one of the best in years.
",0.8481,0.9973,2018-07-10 00:00:00,9,"Captain Fantastic' is an emotionally charged family drama with excellent characters and performances that truly elevate the picture. The film feels very naturalistic, thanks to the handheld camera and realistic nature of the screenplay and acting. The film is heavily politically charged, however writer/director Matt Ross does a good job at allowing the audience to make up their own political viewpoints. While the film is told from the 'Cash' family's perspective, the character of 'Jack', who would traditionally be seen as the film's antagonist, isn't portrayed as evil but simply another man with different attitudes to life. This is where the film really excels. It opens a window to the lives of a wide variety of characters and never tells us how to feel, instead simply showing us what they think and feel and allowing us to decide how we react to that. At times, the film is genuinely funny too and that is another aspect of this film that I love. It has the perfect blend of drama and comedy and, as such, feels very much like a slice-of-life. It can be dead serious and genuinely emotionally affecting one minute, and then funny and feel-good the next. Viggo Mortensen delivers an outstanding performance as a father who just wants the best for his children, and this is another great aspect of the film. It is about the importance of family, and explores what 'family' means to different people and social groups. The contrasts between how different groups perceive Ben's parenthood sets the film apart and allows audiences to choose how they personally feel. In conclusion 'Captain Fantastic' is not only one of the most genuinely emotional and heartwarming films of recent years, but also one of the best. 9/10"
" Where are u wrong with your children?
",-0.4767,0.9915,2018-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm not a communist, but I loved Captain Fantastic.
It's important to start this review saying that I'm not a communist, just because the extremals capitalists would say that only communists love this movie. 
Who never was a teenager asking themselves the following: How I will care my children?
It's inevitable to think that we will try to care them keeping away from drugs, premature sex and diseases, trying to educate them in a way that they turn into our friends and confidants.
But it's not easy. While you're trying to explain to them some things about life, they are hearing another thousand things from TV, Internet and other things. It's something like trying to cover the sun with a transparent fabric. 
The movie shows us an alternative of a desperate parent, the isolation. Ben and his wife, Leslie, moved to a forest in a tentative of caring their children away from the capitalist way of life. They live quite well during long years, but her wife, that had a disease, starts to see her health state get worst. In a forest it's quite impossible to solve somethings and they decide to move her to a hospital at civilization. And that's the moment where the movie starts. Leslie stays away from home during, approximately, three months. While this, Ben kept a high level rigor to caring with their children on all activities. Their children looks like genius in all activities, they know everything about politics, they are athletes, they know how to take care of a plantation and they love and obey their father. Ben is always paying attention to what is happening and trying to give all of his attention to their children. They are real family, in all points of view. But when Ben receives the sad info that his wife is dead, some problems in their relationship with his children are exposed. That happens because his father-in-law doesn't approve their way of life and decides to put their children against their father.
It's easy to see that this thing was only a disagreement, but the movie works to create empathy between us, the expectators, and them. You will really cheer to Ben! 
Without spoilers, I will jump directly to my point of view. I, as a future father, have million plans about how I would care my children. None of them consider change my personality. None of them is about be the same. None of them consider keep my sons in a prison. None of them will give too much freedom to them.
Be a father is not something that you can plan. Is about show to your son what you learn in life and be inclusive. Your son doesn't needs to have his father on his side all the time. Your son needs to want you by his side all the time. And the only way of getting it, is being a partner. Ben, put his rigor at the side, is that to them. Specially because he is available all the time. He doesn't have a cellphone, a television or a hard job to share his attention. How much of your time are you dedicating to do things that you really like or even don't like with your children?
Think about it."
" Crazy movie about crazy people doing crazy things
",-0.7351,0.9521,2018-06-22 00:00:00,2,"I am aware that in terms of acting or cinematography, this movie received a lot of nominations. But for me there are some disturbing things from what is presented in it.This film seems to teach about freedom, i.e do not want to be bound by norms or rules that have been generally accepted. But is it true that someone can indeed be free like that? Is not it in the so-called freedom by Ben Cash, he also has some rules that his children must do? Therefore, the problem is not whether a person is free of rules or bound by rules (basically, everyone is bound by the rules of life). The problem is that Cash is too arrogant to accept the prevailing rules and thinks that his own rules of life are the most correct.In his arrogance, thinking that his rule or lifestyle is the most correct one, Cash teaches his children to steal. They stole food in the supermarket, stole his mother's body and taught his children to fight the police (the authorities).In his arrogance that believes his lifestyle is right, Cash teaches that a person is allowed to be naked in a public place. Cash might think that why should we be governed by norms that are generally prevalent in society in naked affairs? Does not every man have a penis? What is wrong with showing a penis that is a member of the body itself to anyone? Cash does not want to be governed by such politeness norms. But the irony is, Cash himself made the rule that it should not be naked at meals? Is not this an ambiguity? Is not this once pointed out that the main reason Cash does what he does is not to support freedom, but that he does not want to recognize the rules of others and only acknowledge his own rules. Cash teaches his children not to be tolerant of others, no need to respect the beliefs of others. Just do what they think is right, no need to care about others. What kind of parent is this?I am deeply disappointed that the value of a film is as if it is only placed on how actors play their roles, or on how unique a story is. Why is it that we are not disturbed by the teachings of wild life that potentially damage the soul of a child? Or at least limiting a child to seeing the world in a broader way? In Cash's effort to give his children freedom to live in nature, Cash has limited their freedom of interaction and normal relationships with others who are different from them.Are we not aware that by assigning high marks to such film like this one, we indirectly also agree on a man's lifestyle that teaches his children to steal? So, if you think this is good, do you want to raise your own children in this manner?"

Everything in this movie plot, acting, editing, cinematography, soundtrack all are very good. Especially cinematography and soundtrack. Some shots in this movie are simple but filled with complexity at the same time and gorgeous to look at.

",0.1531,0.8862,2018-05-24 00:00:00,3,"It's a shame that it's so rare to have a ""back to nature"" movie without flooding it with radical left wing ideologies. This movie would have been great if the family had stayed in the woods and talked about nature.Instead you quickly find that they're all sociopaths (with at least one true psychopath) they all hate capitalism while they clearly enjoy the benefits of it like most of the latte sipping lefties. Clearly this guy has set up his own little cult of followers that (had they been Christian) would have triggered mass anger from the left to the dangers of Fundamentalism.3 stars for the beautiful nature scenes, 0 stars for everything else.EDIT:By the way. Subsistence living is HARD, and doing so without large arable farmland is even harder. There is no way that this small family could not only hunt and gather enough food to survive (to say nothing of vitamin deficiencies) and ALSO become experts in philosophy, biology, quantum mechanics, mountaineering, economic and political theory, and music. They would be spending the vast majority of their day simply gathering enough food to survive. This is especially true since the Pacific Northwest is most certainly not the breadbasket of the American continent.One final note: Ever notice how the ""tolerant and enlightened"" leftists ONLY insult Christians? Why don't they go after Islam or Judaism? All three make up the Abrahamic religions and are very similar in the core concepts. I guess it's not trendy to insult Muslims. Either that or they don't want a Jihad proclaimed against them like Charlie Hebdo..."

This movie gets a lot of hate, and i kinda see why, but i think the haters are whining. Yes, this movie can be offensive, it's the purpose of it and it does a damn good job at it! It portrayes two very different sides of life with all it's pro's and cons from BOTH SIDES. The movie doesn't pick a side at any time and overall, this is a very good display on the old right/wrong subject, because there IS NO right or wrong! Viggo Mortensens acting is always spot-on, and this is no exception. He always portrays a character so incredibly well, and the role of confused but caring father suits him like a charm. All the kids do a great job too, especially considering the age of the youngest few. I have to add; i've been a Christan for most of my life but i'm open minded to any healthy critisism. I hear people say this movie has too many attacks at Christianity, but what i see is good, critical viewpoint from all perspectives on the subject. Again, there is no bashing or overpraising either side, just a grounded view, and i have never seen a movie do it like Captain Fantastic! Really a fantastic movie that makes you use your brain! Don't watch if you are easily offended, but if you are open to it, you will enjoy every minute! Great soundtrack at the ending to!"
" Says so much about American society and education with humour and insight
",0.4767,0.9564,2018-04-29 00:00:00,9,"This film was full of insights and deep truths about American society and showed how much courage and individualism it takes to struggle and confront the hypocrisy and contradictions that exist in the system, in particular in relation to educating the young. 
The future survival of our world will depend on the ability to question and rethink the status quo, yet many young Americans are being educated to focus solely on making money and keeping up with the Jones'. This film gives the viewer a compelling narrative that demonstrates an alternative approach. 
On a 'craft level' I thought the camera work was inspired, the performances - in particular the young actors - were emotionally solid and beautifully cast. The score underpinned the emotion of the piece with subtlety and choice of songs worked really well to pin point the connection with 60s counter-culture.

If you are a parent.. well same story. This movie criticizes the flaws of a modern family and religious ethics in what one would call somewhat overkill methods. But it's all worth it. In my personal opinion, this movie shows us what humans could and should be. This should be the movie that should actually be titled ""World's Greatest Dad"". Matt Ross has yet again crafted another masterpiece of our time. 10/10!"

" Refreshingly honest and heartfelt; a touching, beautiful and wonderfully eccentric film.
",0.9393,0.9891,2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"'Captain Fantastic (2016)' is a refreshingly honest and heartfelt feature which manages to be surprisingly emotional, almost making me tear up on a couple of occasions, and isn't simply signified by its intrinsic eccentricity (so often used as a marketing trick) but rather infinitely enhanced by it. The narrative never becomes clichéd or rote and the excellent performances always keep the sometimes outlandish happenings both grounded and wonderful. Once it reaches its apparently promised conclusion, however, it slows down and starts to head in a slightly generic, if necessary, direction. Thankfully, though, the emotional core still remains and it isn't long before the film is back to its own off-kilter brand of heart-felt shenanigans as it moves towards an off-base finale which, though it could be somewhat morbid in lesser hands, is here truly touching and a beautiful note on which to end. 8/10"
" Dopamine for sheeples
",0.0,0.2596,2018-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Very good and affective Hollywood sentimentality. Lovely scenery, fine acting, and dramatic use of musical hooks.
So far, so good . The froth is very well done.The substance, however , is unbelievable drivel . As usual with this type of 'feelgood' pap the underlying message is concrete, establishment, American dream. Whatever else happens the dream wins - there is only one way to live and be content and that is to grovel before the adman's spiel and totally resign to their whims.
The entire plot is based upon the emotional freak out of a family within the 1% financially and culturally and has no connection whatever with the vast bulk of humanity . None of what happens could or would occur in any normal family - largely because they wouldn't have the hard cash to indulge in such flippant nonsense, but primarily because all of the consequences of this family's actions in this film would hang far more heavily and permanently upon a middle/working class group.
The froth continues in a lame and frankly offensive view of mental illness and a frivolous take on cultural differences . For anyone with a fully functional frontal cortex the morality play is so simplistic as to be risible - right and wrong are literally thrown down the toilet.
This might have been a truly moving and authentic piece had it been set in normality rather than in extreme privilege ."

Because who loves this movie means that he accepts all the ideas in the movie whether it is positive or negative, and I think the only positive thing is sports training for children only, and the negatives are too many like:1/disrespect for heavenly religions, just as people want to respect your beliefs, you equally have to respect their beliefs.
2/educating children on theft, this is a serious phenomenon that can give negative messages to other children in the world to do the same and expose them to the risk of arrest, injury or death as well.
3/Moral corruption, the appearance of the head of the family naked in front of the people and his children is totally unacceptable because you are a human being you have a mind that can control your instincts and not an animal without brains.!
4/humiliation of a dead person, the exhumation of a deceased body of a grave in this way and without a convincing reason is a lack of respect and a heinous act, even Buddhists when they burn dead bodies, they revere the ashes of the deceased by praying, not throwing ashes in the toilet like you did!!!!"

",0.0,0.9754,2018-02-03 00:00:00,1,"It seems it's hip these days, to bash Christianity in film and tv. This movie does it with its' disrespectful position on the Christian faith. It's used a punchline to drive home the point that they don't believe in religion. I went back and forth on liking this movie, and hating it. What I decided on was, that the writer(s) didn't need to make fun of a religion, in order to convince us of the character's ""place"" in the universe, and of the Earth. It was readily apparent that the way they were living, the philosophies they spoke of (Buddhism mentioned twice), the way they were different from everyone else was a differing viewpoint - and that making fun of Christianity was just a cheap shot, something so very prevalent in Hollywood today. How can they ever expect to be respected for a differing viewpoint, when they don't extend the same courtesy to others ? Hypocrites, who are no better than me, no better than you. If they had substituted Christianity, with Judaism, Muslim, Wiccan, or any other ""group"", would it have been so easily accepted by the masses ? It should be just as easy to respect other's beliefs and customs, as it is to make fun of them.I was also offended at the continued vulgar language prevalent around and by the children in this movie. We're raising a planet full of kids who know no boundaries of decency. It's a form of child abuse. If you are 50 or over, then most likely, you were not raised to use or hear the words F***, God D***, S***, and others, until you were maybe 10 or over."

He venerates Noam Chomsky and together with his Buddhist wife has led the family to live in a forest and kill animals for food - a typically Buddhist activity! He is drilling his kids to be something like Antifa Special Forces. This regime and the homeschooling without electricity has produced magical results: at least three of the children are geniuses; the 16-17 year old has mastered theoretical physics at graduate school level (the difficult mathematics behind it is not even worth mentioning), and so on. Really, this film is as anti-intellectual as it can be. (It is no exception in this regard to many US movies; I always laugh when, on screen, I see »Math professors« scribbling meaningless formulas, as if taken from American comic books.) The 8 year old daughter of the family has built a shrine to Pol Pot; after all he killed millions of Christians and Buddhists, and the family despises Christians.

They all loved it. The central question in my mind after watching is actually posed by Viggo Mortenson in the ""extras"": Is the main character insane or insanely great? He certainly lives life by his own rules, which is awesome, but of course when you're a parent, especially a (n effectively) single parent, that has consequences. He is true to his beliefs in ways I think many of can only aspire to, and he pays the price (as do his kids).This is one of those films that gets better after a 2nd viewing, and I'd happily give it another screening."

The only people I can see not getting some sort of satisfactory level of enjoyment out of the film (At the very least) are those whom it offends in some non-obvious way. I left it having thoroughly enjoyed the experience. If that is all you need, I wouldn't bother reading any further. The basic plot (no spoilers) revolves around a family who live in isolation from general society - living off the land mostly, hunting etc, with little contact with anyone else. For reasons I won't mention they end up having to mix back in with 'civilization' and this is basically what the movie revolves around... the contrast between those living in regular society and those who grew up with a completely different value system. The movie explores this premise fairly well, sometimes in obvious ways, but overall effectively done. The movie contains drama and humour, both of which are done subtly, I certainly never felt i was being beaten over the head with it. The movie is an easy watch, and opens the mind to ponder the pros and cons of different ways of life and different ways of approaching life. I feel those who criticize the film extensively possibly took it too seriously. As I have mentioned, I went in knowing little about it and left feeling very happy for the experience.

He has the healthiest, smartest, self reliant, responsible, free-thinking kids on the planet in his Plato's Utopia. You love them all. The children have a Marxist/Chomsky view of the world with a disdain for capitalism and waste. They celebrate Noam Chomsky's birthday with gifts of hunting knives and not Christmas.When their hospitalized mother commits suicide, they travel to attend her funeral, one where they are not welcomed by grandfather Frank Langella.Being a Chomsky reader, I instantly loved the film. The film is about choices as to which poison do you want. You can live in society where we all fed poison both mentally and physically or you can live apart and become socially dysfunctional, depriving yourself of all the pop cultural references I make in my reviews. Thanks for choosing the former. The performances were great.The film is against obesity, capitalism, and Christianity. If they had any real guts, they would have titled the film, ""Steal this Movie."" Guide: F-word. Nudity (Viggo Mortensen). No sex."
" New Title: Sweet Child O Mine
",0.4588,0.9366,2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"Captain Fantastic opens in a scene of apparent ritualistic and unfettered savagery unencumbered by ""civilization."" As Dad teaches his tribe of six children to hunt, climb, and—God forbid—think on high levels, he strives to mold them into a combination of survivalists, rebels, and young Socrates and Platos. Yet all is not well in paradise. Mom is somewhere back in civilization being treated for mental illness. Rebellion is brewing in the ranks as the second son blames his father for his mother's problems. When mom chooses a permanent solution, an odyssey into the ""real"" world brings the family face to face with inane cousins who can barely tolerate setting aside their electronics for some familial interaction, who participate in more acceptable forms of violence via Xbox, and whose schooling—while more socially acceptable in delivery—fails to impress. A loving but misguided grandfather then seeks to take the six siblings away from the only parent they have left, and the children themselves orchestrate their escape back to the only life they've known, however primitive. Throughout the film, parenting, philosophical, and even legal quandaries challenge the viewer's preconceptions about what constitutes a proper upbringing. In the end, one must conclude that no one right way to parent exists. Ultimately, Dad compromises in response to his brood's needs, yet the peaceful, electronics-free ending is testament to the enduring positive influence of their previously ""uncivilized"" lifestyle. Finally, the title ""Captain Fantastic"" focuses attention on the father even though the real story lies in the lives of the children and the forces of authority and chaos that surround them. Thus, ""Sweet Child O Mine"" seems to be a better title, and the Guns n Roses classic features heavily in an emotional, culminating scene late in the movie."
" Pleasant, and only a little disturbing
",0.0754,0.9829,2017-08-26 00:00:00,7,"This is sort of a Beverly Hillbillies, without the comedy and with a serious tone. Fish out of water tales are nothing knew. But if you want to see a culture clash, on a kinder level, this may be for you. Good performances on all side. As I have said in other reviews, this new generation of child actors, bodes well for the future. This also however has a slightly darker side. But not in the movie itself, but for the audience. It's clear that the director and/or producer has a political agenda in mind, casting the ideology of the family portrayed as good. Versus the dark affluent and ambivalent lifestyle of the grandparents as well, not so good. Sadly, Christian based dramas are attacked, and this one being the opposite of Christian is...not. That being said, the story is very good. Though the lack of punishment at the end for the obvious crime committed, is a little unrealistic. This can be forgiven though, as a happy ending is entirely in order here. Its worth the watch, if your ideological sensibilities aren't too sensitive."
" This is a Parody of Life off the Grid Of a Family Cult
",0.0,-0.9814,2017-08-25 00:00:00,4,"""Captain Fantastic"" should be treated like a parody of living life off the grid. I didn't enjoy it and I can't relate to these characters except for their love of books. Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) is the titular Captain Fantastic with three sons and three daughters. The kids range in ages of 6 to 18 years or so. All of these kids have weird names many celebrities would love! Bodevan aka Bo (George MacKay) is the oldest brother. The teenage girl twins are Kielyr (Samantha Isler) and Vespyr (Annalise Basso). The preteen brother is Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton). Charlie Shotwell is little brother Nai and Shree Crooks is the youngest girl named Zaja. The Cash family lives in the woods in a big tent like structure with no electricity and other modern day trappings. When we first meet the Cash clan they are hunting a deer with knives. Ben cuts out an organ from the deer and Bo eats it. Now he is a man, according to his father! The Cash kids have a very regimented life. They do hard exercises, hand-to-hand combat, kill their own game to eat, and have to listen to Ben talk trash about America, doctors, and anything else their old man doesn't agree with! The kids and Ben read communist and socialist writings around the campfire at night. Then it's music time courtesy of Bo and Ben. These family members know many languages, how to navigate by the stars, and they know how to make their own clothes. Little Zaja is an aspiring taxidermist who has a shrine built to honor Pol Pot and other atrocities. Little Nai is a nudist who is told by Ben to put clothes on when the family eats dinner. A tragedy happens in the insular life the family leads. Ben's wife and the mother of the children is bipolar Leslie (Trin Miller) who has been in the hospital for 3 months. She kills herself and Ben receives the news from his sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn) on the phone. Ben also is told by Leslie's father Jack (Frank Langella) not to come to the funeral. Ben says Leslie was a Buddhist and she wouldn't want to be buried in a Christian ceremony because the family makes fun of Christians. Leslie wants cremation and then a celebration of her life. Jack is upset with Ben and hangs up. The children are all upset about their mom and Rellian stabs the wall with a knife. The kids want to attend their mom's funeral and their father relents and takes them to New Mexico on their old bus, Steve. Along the way, the kids get their dad out of a ticket for a missing light by singing religious hymns to the cop. He lets them go. The twins speak Esperanto and refuse to kill a sheep to feed the family. Ben takes them to a restaurant and then leaves with them because in his mind, the menu has no food on it. He fakes a heart attack in the store while the kids take food. Then instead of Christmas, it's Noam Chompsky Day! The kids get knives from Ben. Rellian wants to have Christmas and Ben refuses. Ben doesn't want his family celebrating a magic elf. Everyone in the family swears a blue streak when they aren't reading. They also talk about rape openly when the subject is about the book ""Lolita."". Ben also finds time to walk around nude in front of his kids. In the meantime, Bo gets acceptance letters from Ivy League colleges his mother helped him apply to and he proposes marriage to a girl he just met. All hell breaks loose when Ben finds out the letters because he has no idea what a college can teach a person who can speak 6 languages and all like Bo can! Harper and husband Dave (Steve Zahn) have a different life than Ben with 2 grumpy teen boys who have trouble with the Bill of Rights when Ben asks them about it. Zaja can name all the amendments, though! The funeral is a disaster with Ben taking over and being a sight in his ugly red suit! Jack has him escorted out. The children are thrilled to see their grandparents and Rellian forms a bond with Jack. He wants to live with his grandparents Jack and Abigail (Ann Dowd). The grandparents want custody of their daughter's children. The family goes on a mission to rescue Rellian and Vespyr breaks her leg while trying to break her brother out of Jack and Abigail's house. She is taken to the hospital and put in a cast. What happens is kind of gross and ridiculous! This family steals Leslie's body from her grave and the body looks more like a mannequin than a human being! They take her to the woods and burn her on a funeral pyre. The only thing I liked about the scene was Vespyr singing ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" while the family plays their instruments in time and dance around. They take her ashes to a public place and flush them down the toilet as per her instructions. In the end, Ben doesn't get in trouble for being a menace and Jack gives the family a farm house to live in. The kids attend normal school and Bo goes to Africa. The acting was very good from all involved and I thought they looked like a real family! I hate how isolated and intolerant this family is, though! It won't be pretty when the kids meet Christians or Cambodians who lost their families in the Killing Fields. As a parody this movie works but only as that and certainly not as a comedy or a drama!"

But despite its occasional subtlety, it's simply too sparse and pleased with itself to warrant the running time.

" Rating: A
",0.0,0.9974,2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"Captain Fantastic definitely caught me by surprise. It wasn't on my initial list of ""movies to watch"" of 2016, but when it came out it got so many positive reviews that I had to add it to my watch list.The cast is brilliant: Mortensen makes his run for an Oscar, he's so compelling and captivating, I was totally into his character. Ben is able to make me cry and laugh at the same time, as well as most of this film ... It's either super funny or terribly sad with its constant twists. Once again, the cast is absolutely pitch-perfect, but besides Viggo Mortensen I have to congratulate Shree Crooks (Zaja) and Charlie Shotwell (Nai). These are the youngest of the children and they are at the same amazing level that Millie Bobby Brown is at Stranger Things. I still can't believe how realistic they are in their appearances, even if only for brief moments. Everyone else is great as well and each of the kids gets their own scene to shine!The story is so thought-provoking that challenges the audience to understand everyone's perspective on life. Who we think are the bad guys, actually might be the good ones and vice-versa. Ben and his children have a very different life because of all the society's stereotypes and overall problems that they don't have while living isolated in a forest ... However, the civilization's point of view is that a bunch of hippies decided to quit life and live on their own with no social interaction whatsoever, which doesn't exactly prepare his kids for their future. It's a brave and massively interesting plot that keeps our eyes and ears glued to the screen.My only issue with this movie is the ending. Without spoiling anything, it felt a little disappointing having in mind everything that I experienced with the film and the family. I think Matt Ross was trying to follow this one path, but near the end, decided to change it drastically.Still, Captain Fantastic is one of my favorite movies of 2016! It delivers a beautiful message, it has a delightful cast, with Viggo Mortensen stepping up his game and an adventure-full story that still manages to end on a very bright note.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" wonderfully told, brilliantly thought provoking
",0.7964,0.9887,2017-07-31 00:00:00,9,"Captain Fantastic centers around the idea of being an outsider and the struggle of outsiders against modern day consumerism and social mannerisms. It is made in such a way that evokes a sense of wonder and discovery as we follow Viggo Mortensen's Ben as he attempts to raise his 6 kids in his so called paradise. It challenges his character on what it means to be a parent but also challenges social viewpoints and what education is about. It is wonderfully thought provoking as the film follows a lighthearted and playful beat, asking audience the questions of whether such a mindset that Ben has is truly hindering or forward thinking. It is the outsider's tale as these children attempt to blend and adapt to the modern day society with a hint of childhood innocence. Indeed it is all of these themes tied up into a tale of a father's love to his children, perhaps a simple premise but told in a fascinating and almost magical way that just has some kind of a draw to it."

Diversion from the norm and anti-conformism is not fashionable these with everyone watching sequel number 8 of the last piece of shlock but that such a film is out there shows that there is still hope for cinema. DVD has a lack of extras and the discussions I was hoping for, but with Captain Fantastic slated to become a popular classic there may be future editions. My fave part? The part about fantasy elves or whatever they said about religion. Happy Noam Chomsky Day!"
" Not to be confused with Steve Rogers
",0.2411,0.6199,2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"'Captain Fantastic' is a film that I've had on my radar for quite some time. I'd heard all good things about it before I sat down to watch it, so this normally meant that I find myself totally let down with what I got. And, what I got was not what I expected. I'll admit to enjoying it and being glad that I have seen it, however, despite my good feelings towards it, I'm not sure it's the sort of film that would inspire a repeat viewing any time soon. Viggo Mortensen (always worth a watch) plays a single father who looks after his children 'on the land' as you could call it. They live together deep in a forest and have little to know contact with what we would describe as 'civilisation.' Here, Viggo teaches his brood how to survive using only nature and basic survival techniques that you wouldn't get in your average comprehensive. And they're thriving – sort of. They all agree with this way of life, but largely because it's all they've ever known. And, no matter how cool, Viggo is, he didn't raise them on his own. Early on we find that the children's mother is in hospital and, sadly, she doesn't come out again. This is the catalyst which launches the family on a road trip to her home town (and awaiting parents who really don't agree with their daughter's lifestyle) for her funeral. So, what you end up with is a real clash of cultures. Obviously the father once lived among us 'norms' and most likely owned a mobile phone, mortgage and worked 9-5. However, his children haven't and we see how they react to this alien world.I wonder whether people see this film differently if they have or haven't got children. Personally, as a parent, I understood the father's desire to want to shelter his children from all the 'horrors' of the modern world. No one wants to see their children exposed to dull, soulless 9-5 jobs, rubbish girlfriend/boyfriends and generally people who want to do them down at every turn. However, as much as we want to wrap our children up and shield them from everything negative, we have to allow them the freedom to make their own mistakes. This is the lesson of the film. Not to mention how different people react to different ideals. It's fair to say that Viggo's father-ion-law is not particularly happy with his son-in-law showing up and insisting that the funeral is held according to wishes of a dead person who can no longer confirm how she wanted to be mourned.It's all quite deep and high drama and I can see why such praise was heaped on it. It asks questions about the way we live and the pros and cons of various lifestyles. However, as I said at the beginning, despite liking it, I just found it's not something I could watch again anytime soon. In a few years time if I see that it's on the telly and nothing else is on, I'll definitely watch it again. Just not worth buying on Blu-ray at full price."

The last film I watched that was so smart, intellectual and articulate was V For Vendetta. The two films are not comparable visually and story-wise, but certainly show that deviation from the mainstream and presentation of new ideas is possible without heavy-handed scripts that are not also entertaining. This film is fun to watch. Mortenson always brings a lot of talent to the screen, but it is surprise that a man who showed a lot of talent on screen with Big Love has the same and more behind the camera. Kudos to all involved. The American film industry is more than stupid sequels, reboots, remakes and reactionary money gobbling messes. Captain Fantastic proves it."

The movie has highlighted some of the nuances of current society. The schooling, the social interactions and priorities etc. It's a conflict between the parental guidance and philosophy; whether you should let your kids know everything when they have a question then and there or wait till they come of age.

" Great Potential Soured by Strange Decisions
",0.5106,-0.9985,2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"This film left me a bit perplexed. The premise of six wilderness dwelling, society-shunning children and their unusually strict, blunt, and academically-inclined father being forced to confront modern society is genuinely very compelling. Viggo Mortensen's performance as the father is great (dare I say 'Fantastic'?), and the family's chemistry feels energetic and natural, albeit highly unusual. The film's cinematography and general aesthetic is also quite striking. The film's writing, however, is truly baffling at times. Most of this stems from the family's interactions with the modern world once they leave their home in the wilderness.Before I get into that, though, I really want to stress that Captain Fantastic is, on most levels, a fine film. Despite my reservations about many of the choices that were made, I'd still probably be inclined to recommend it to most people who are interested in exploring the dynamics and problems of a strangely unique family if they can tolerate the occasional dose of insufferable hypocrisy or arrogance. I honestly went into the film expecting to like it a lot, so I take no delight in picking it apart to explain what I believe is wrong with it, but I think it is worth doing. Also keep in mind that because this is probably going to be a love/hate movie for many people, these things I list might not bother you at all. That being said, let's get into some of the strange choices with the writing, of which there are many.We as the audience naturally expect the family to behave in an unusual manner given their rather extreme lifestyle, but what we don't expect is the rather distasteful undercurrent of arrogance and contempt for other people that seems to consistently guide their behavior. They are not merely fish out of water innocently bumbling through their interactions. Instead, they are constantly reassuring themselves of the inferiority and hopeless degeneracy of those around them, while reinforcing in their minds their own superiority.The family's inwardness allows them to justify various narcissistic antisocial behaviors. This includes the family stealing large quantities of merchandise from a store using a deceptive scheme, insulting and/or mocking nearly everyone they encounter including members of their own extended family (even when treated with hospitality), the father instructing his children to perform dangerous activities resulting in injuries, and openly despising Christians (but no other religions or beliefs). The family also has rather extreme communist leanings, even going as far as to identify favorably with despicable totalitarian communist dictators (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.). The oldest son goes as far as to seriously refer to himself as ""not a Trotskyist anymore, but a Maoist"", which is just an embarrassingly asinine thing to say.There are numerous other bizarre behaviors, such as the young children's fetishization of knives and other weaponry, clinically utilitarian honesty about sex, drugs, violence, death, rape, and suicide with young children, not only allowing and justifying young children drinking alcohol, but pouring them glasses of wine under the assumption they will drink it even if they didn't ask for it (with an ironically absent diatribe about the real dangers of alcohol particularly for children, despite going into morbidly and tediously explicit academic detail about almost every other subject imaginable), and who could forget the family's inexplicable worship of Noam Chomsky. I can't quite figure out if these are inserts by the writer/director that in some way reflect his own viewpoints, or if he is attempting to poke fun at people who think and behave this way. Either way, it doesn't come across as funny or satirical despite the film being labeled a ""comedy"". But it sure is obnoxious.Why do these details matter? Because this mixture of unpleasant traits make them come across as not just weird, but delusional, antisocial, arrogant, hypocritical, mean-spirited, and even dangerous. These traits can absolutely work in the right story, but they don't work well in a narrative about a father raising his impressionable young children. It's not a good sign when it's easy to see how if the father wanted his children to kill someone, it wouldn't take him long to convince them how, when, where, and why to do it with some lengthy pseudo-intellectual lecture about the evils of capitalism, his kids then rushing off with their knives to do the deed, all while smiling and singing. To put it simply, the family dynamic is that of a cult. Yet the film never ceases to treat the cult's leader (and chief brainwasher of children) as completely sympathetic.But all of this could be forgiven if the right ending properly redeemed these character traits. Could the children ever live within society, or would they forever be outcasts? Is there some disastrous consequence of the way they have chosen to live? Instead, the father is more or less bailed out of his problematic situation by a relative, despite being extremely disrespectful towards this person constantly. This is essentially a deus ex machina moment that makes no sense and provides no satisfying resolution. After the father has his realization that maybe his kids need to be prepared to deal with the real world, he leaves on his own, only to have his entire brood of kids inexplicably emerge from a compartment in their bus hours later to console him at the exact moment he needed it, another deus ex machina moment. The film then ends with, again, no resolution to the characters' actual underlying problems integrating into society.It really is unfortunate that such a great premise is burdened with so many elements that are obnoxious, hypocritical, or just don't go anywhere. The family of characters, especially the father, are just grating enough to frequently be annoying or alienating to the general audience member. I really feel that if the aggressively smug and cult-like family dynamic was toned down and the ending was better executed, this would be a genuinely great film. But the devil is in the details."

Does anyone see a problem with realism here? I don't really know what this movie wants of me. It is far too unrealistic to take it seriously, yet not funny enough to make me laugh more than once or twice. The whole ""super-scientist- survivalist-left-wing-hippie-fantastic-dad"" is just cramming too many things into one character, most of which don't even make that much sense. Apart from a shallow pseudo-conflict between Fantastic Dad and one of his sons, there is no conflict whatsoever in this family, and no flaws or downsides to any characters to make them resemble actually believable real-life human beings.What makes this movie watchable is the great acting, the good music, and the two or three geunuinely funny scenes.

The plot goes exactly where you thought it would go, offering the conflicts and doubts and laughs and awkward situations that would be expected to arise from its premise. Each scene is slightly spiced up and peppered with more insightful details so that they won't feel utterly predictable.Towards the end the movie falters and gets a bit lost in the poorly grounded feel-good territory that intends to offer something for everyone, especially to those in the audience who don't want the Captain and his team to be reminders about any real alternatives to the life as we know it. The final scene comes across almost as a betrayal of everything that came before it, pulling the carpet under its message and making it easier to forget."

There are so many movies that start with an original concept, but at some point have just run out of ideas, desperately seeking closure, and, having pulled all situational comedy, just drag out some grinding melodramatic scheme. This movie starts like just one of those. It is beautiful and captivating and comes with a great set of actors. As the family starts off into the 'real world', it pulls off some comedy that you will know if you have seen the trailer. At this point I really wondered how the movie would go on from now - mostly in fearful anticipation that this is said point where many movies go downhill. But it really doesn't. It neither continues as a comedy alone, nor does it turn into any shallow black and white tragedy. It remains entertaining and inspiring and keeps up some good enough narrative tension, and continues to thrive on its excellent actors. I think one should not except from such a movie too much of a theoretical statement on its background setting, the alternative lifestyles, and the many shortcomings of modernity, and of attempted flight from it. It is just a movie, and it does everything right in being primarily entertaining, and achieves to be joyful, positive and casually thought-provoking on the run. And often enough really funny."

" Amazing!
",0.6239,0.9965,2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"I make a point out of not watching movie trailers, as they tend to give away too much about the movie and/or give me unrealistic expectations. In the case of Captain Fantastic, I'm extra happy that I stuck to that concept. I knew very little about Captain Fantastic before I decided to watch it, and after my brother's persistent insisting that I watch it, I finally caved. I'm glad I did, as it is one of the most unique, not to mention one of the greatest, movies I've ever seen. To make a movie where child actors are given lots of screen time is risky, but the casting crew did a great job finding actors. The ""Captain's"" children are played brilliantly by their actors, and I have to commend them as well as the writers for giving each of those characters a distinct personality. From the moment that the family is introduced, I found myself completely immersed in their story, and immediately I wanted to know more. There is great chemistry between all the actors, particularly between the Captain (played wonderfully by Mortensen) and his oldest child, Bodevan, played brilliantly by MacKay. The way that the actors managed to convey the nuances brought on by their characters' developments is truly impressive.Visually, the movie is stunning as well. Two thumbs up!"
" Two Hours of More Left Wing Propaganda Trash
",-0.3102,-0.9005,2017-05-20 00:00:00,1,"The Stupid PlotBen and Leslie Cash have long lived largely off the grid with their offspring - Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai - in a cabin in the mountains of Washington state. The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. This movie is really nothing more than yet another far left anti- American, anti Christian movie. It's such a piece of hypocritical garbage."
" A Thought Provoking Film
",-0.2023,0.9915,2017-05-17 00:00:00,9,"Captain Fantastic is simply worried for the ""good company"" for his children. It is a deep thought reflected in front of us. We all are buyers and even the film crew bought latest technology cameras in order to make this film and to spread this good message. All we have to think about is ""good company"". The company we keep will generate the next results for sure. Therefore this film is about transparency and this film is about how we raise the upcoming generation but mainly this film is about development via means of hard work and building up milestones of truth, honesty and transparency in the heart of our kids. There is a scene of animal hunting in the movie and i feel like captain fantastic would have supported vegetarian eating. Meat eating is bad and captain fantastic must know that. There is a scene of two video game playing boys who does not have basic knowledge of the law of their nation and a eight year old kid outruns them upon the basis of her knowledge. A filmy scene but also a truth where manipulation for selling things is so high that general knowledge is repressed somewhere between so called technological growth and economical development.In the end i would love to say that its time when we leave our ""mechanistic approach"" {as stated by Mr. Capra in the book Uncommon Wisdom} and it is the time when we all should look out for the good and practical effects of good company."

" Definition Of A Cult Film
",0.0,0.9874,2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"I had seen and admired the director on Bog Love, but I had no idea he has such a film in him. Who knew? I was not even aware of this film until I rented it and brought it home yesterday and I just had to review it.This is the best film about life I have seen in a long time. There is this and then there is rubbish sequel like the 25th film where Scarlet Johansson jumps around without reason or talent instead of playing a sedate middle-aged woman. Honestly, this should be the billion dollar grossing film not Marvel #59. It depicts the horrors of modern society and conformity, the tragedy of the human nation Captain Fantastic shows us that no human life no matter how young should be dictated by the norms and clichés of society, the older generation or conformity and that there is nothing more valuable than freedom. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Ross, magnificently photographed with beautiful images of nature, perfect performances by Mortensen and the in-laws brings the whole tragedy of brainwashing, limiting thought and freedom to the fore, but with a lot of fun and wit to boot. This is a cinematic Triumph. Congratulations!"
" Thought-provoking in ways both artistic and heavy-handed, enhanced by Viggo Mortensen
",0.0,0.9881,2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Plenty of movies satirize or poke holes in the way we live our lives, but filmmaker Matt Ross takes the slightly unconventional approach by telling a story not from within modern living, but from well beyond its walls.""Captain Fantastic"" takes us instead into the Washington state wilderness where Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) raises his family of six oddly named children whose mother is sick in the hospital. The children receive rigorous physical conditioning and survival skill- building during most of the day and are also fed a diet of textbooks and literature, making them stronger and smarter than anyone their age. They do things like celebrate ""Noam Chomsky Day"" instead of Christmas and have all their father's beliefs and platitudes about the outside world permanently etched into their brains.The family – and Ben – is forced to reconcile with society when Ben gets news that the mother has died. His in-laws (Frank Langhella and Ann Dowd), blaming Ben's influence on their daughter for her death, threaten him if he should come to New Mexico for the funeral, so Ben and the family take Steve (the family bus) on a road trip to ""save mom,"" who was philosophically Buddhist and wished to be cremated, not buried following a ""proper"" Christian ceremony.In the way he tells this story, Ross paints a rather ""pros and cons"" portrait of this alternative parenting style. When the family visits their cousins en route to the funeral, Ross juxtaposes these kids with their electronics-addicted cousins and it becomes clear the ways in which Ben's parenting is superior. Later in the movie, the pendulum swings to the other side and we see how Ben's decisions have clearly adverse effects. It's a bit of a stiff, methodical approach to what is otherwise an idea very worth exploring.Helping to break down the lines of these ""Exhibit A,"" ""Exhibit B"" types of scenes is Mortensen's performance. Nothing about his performance is dictated by moments in which he is meant to look like a great parent and moments he's meant to look like a selfish one. He is all those things in every scene and the way the story forces him to reconcile with his parenting choices gives him lots of room to work with and convey the movie's most important questions. Ross ends up serving his main character answers to those questions on a perfect platter, but Mortensen makes the journey worthwhile.Ross' approach is far more mainstream than an indie titled ""Captain Fantastic"" (no idea why it's called that) would lead you to believe, which means it can be recommended to audiences with broader tastes. Although it can't quite be recommended for family viewing due to the mature themes, swearing and full-frontal male nudity, the film's humor and drama are both very accessible and its themes far from esoteric. For example, a scene in which the family stays at a trailer park and the oldest child (George MacKay) becomes taken with a young woman (Erin Moriarty) plays out in a way you might expect for a teenager who has never been in a romantic situation before. The humor and endearing nature of this sequence would make sense to anyone, as do many of the other jokes positioned around these sheltered children's exposure to standard societal living. There are even a few amusing ways that the family makes standard societal people extremely uncomfortable, which will make viewers think more deeply about why certain things are considered taboo and why the rules are the rules.At the heart of ""Captain Fantastic,"" even in its most two- dimensional moments, is an understanding that there is no right or wrong way to live, and there is no right or wrong way to be a parent. And frankly, your kids will resent you no matter how you raise them, though ideally they'll love you in equal measure. Ross wraps this up in a little too neat of a bow, but the story is relevant, genuinely thought- provoking and Mortensen's crystallizes all of it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Enthralling and honest
",0.5106,0.9515,2017-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Intelligent and funny, full of colour and emotion, this gripping movie does a great job of taking on the downsides of our more civilised life: detachment from nature, eroding of family bonds, focus on amassing wealth rather than experience and knowledge, lacking ethics. And then when you're lulled into believing going back to the roots is the answer, makes you understand it's all not that easy and one-sided. An impressive cast and story keeps you enthralled for the full two hours. It's interesting to read the negative reviews, which all focus on one thing basically: the perceived slight against our way of living. What they mostly seem to miss completely is the honesty with which the problems and short-comings of Ben's mindset are brought up. Most notably when he runs out of words to defend his actions (like teaching his kids to steal from a supermarket, or running the risk of climbing a rock face in uncertain weather) to his father-in-law, when he has to admit the life in the woods did not help his late wife, when his son rightfully accuses him of not preparing him enough (making him a freak) for social encounters, when he has to apologise for not respecting the rules of people within their own house. And when the movie finishes on a compromise.The bad reviews also mention (not without merit) the many extraordinary and too little explained talents Ben has. But it would take extraordinary people to attempt and successfully create this utopia, so just imagine he's the one that had the tenacity and qualifications to succeed where others have failed. I mean outdoorsy physicists interested in history and philosophy DO exist ;)! One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years."

The cast is headed by Viggo Mortensen, who is quite excellent in a quirky part that's full of depth and character, but it's the kids who really shine in this one. They fully convey the mixture of emotions that their characters feel as they undergo the film's journey and it also helps that they're very funny too. The film is by parts dramatic, tragic, and humorous, and it also has a strong philosophical angle which I enjoyed. In fact, I can think of no other film quite like it, and that has to count for something."

Yes, we live in a black and white-thinking world, where you're either hippie brilliant or suburban white trash.

" ""No one will magically appear and save you in the end.""
",0.25,-0.9075,2017-04-10 00:00:00,5,"In my review of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", I stated that suggesting twelve year olds in the film were having sex in a tent was one of the ways modern day film makers were contributing to the moral decay of society. I then pondered when one of them might lower the bar even further by taking it down to the level of eleven or ten year olds. Well, writer and director Matt Ross jumped the shark here when he had his protagonist Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) give eight year old daughter a copy of 'The Joy of Sex' following a discussion of penises and vaginas, and how they go together during intercourse. So now I have my answer; anyone going for seven year olds? Just like political figures on the far left, it appears that liberal film makers no longer attempt to disguise the biases in their work. Along with the irresponsible message on sex (Ben later advises son Bo to be tender with a girl he makes love to, even if he doesn't like her), there's an outright slam on Christians as a constituency you can safely make fun of. Don't even get me started on role model Dad faking a heart attack in a grocery store scam so the kids could fulfill their mission of 'freeing the food'. Noam Chomsky's defense of unconditional freedom of speech even gets a workout here, and at the dinner table no less, when the death of Ben's wife is referenced by stating that she killed herself. Pass the dessert please.There's only one thing of merit I got out of the story, and that was Ben's advice and interpretation of the word 'STOP' on the cliff face - 'Stay calm, Think, Observe and Plan'. Nowhere in there did I get the idea that that might have applied to grave robbing and flushing one's cremated ashes down a public toilet, but hey, I must have missed something. And please, if you're going to have one of your leads sing at a memorial service for dead Mom, find out if she has a voice ahead of time. Then again, I imagine she was supposed to sound terrible in keeping with the ambiance of the rest of the picture.One last thing - try getting that image of full frontal Viggo out of your head once it's seared into your subconscious.

The narrative drags along at a snails pace, but worst of all perhaps are the countless scenes and situations which we are presumably supposed to take seriously (?) but which are at face value absurd or implausible , and for which little or no effort seems to have been made to make them believable. Two examples: Grandpa Jack's unexplained mafia-don-like powers of influence over Mommy's funeral proceedings (mommies last will and testament?), and daddy's sending daughter up walls and across rooftops of mansion on suicidal mission to somehow extract brother, against his will, without anyone inside noticing. Are we supposed to take these scenes seriously ? There is little humour throughout the film to signal that we shouldn't. The attempts at what (one assumes) is supposed to be humour generally fail (I think there were two instances of half-laughter during our cinema showing of the movie), and what (again, one assumes) are supposed to be unambiguously 'cutesy' moments just generally come across as creepy. Other scenes have little story or content and seem to just try to fill the void with jarringly loud atmospheric new-age type music. In the end they're all either annoying or largely forgettable.

Basically Ben Cash (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller) live in the wilderness of Washington, with their six children: Bodevan ""Bo"" (George MacKay), Kielyr (Samantha Isler), Vespyr (Annalise Basso), Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), Zaja (Shree Crooks) and Nai (Charlie Shotwell). They are disillusioned with capitalism and American life, choosing to inject survivalist skills, left wing politics, and philosophy in their children, they have been educated to think critically; trained to be self-reliant, physically fit and athletic; and guided without technology, demonstrating the beauty of coexisting with nature. Leslie is hospitalised for bipolar disorder, she eventually commits suicide, Ben is blunt and tells this to his children, Leslie wishes to be cremated, despite this her father Jack (Frank Langella) plans to hold a traditional funeral and burial. Ben and Jack argue about this over the phone, Jack threatens to have Ben arrested if he attends the funeral, he initially decides not to do so, also preventing his children from going, but he changes his mind. This leads Ben and the children on a road trip out of the wilderness, where they are both fascinated and confused by all the modern day things in the places they go. The family briefly stay at the house of Ben's sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn), she and her husband suggest Ben's children should attend school for traditional education, he argues that his children are better educated than her children, including his youngest giving her knowledge of the bill of rights. Ben and his children arrive at the funeral, Ben reads out Leslie's last will and testament, which instructed her family to cremate her, and flush her ashes down the toilet, Jack angered has Ben and the children forcibly removed. Ben's children start to doubt his parenting skills, his son Rellian accusing him of failing to treat Leslie's mental health, his son Bodevan accusing him of failing to equip them for the real world. Rellian wants to live with his grandparents, Vespyr climbs out of a window trying to ""help"" him, she falls off the roof and narrowly avoids breaking her neck, Ben is shocked and allows Jack to take custody of his children. The children begin to bond with their grandparents, but decide to follow Ben again when he departs, in the end Ben and children honour Leslie's wishes, burning her corpse and flushing her ashes down an airport toilet, Bodevan leaves the family to travel and find his place in the world, while Ben and the rest settle on a farm, and they ready themselves to go to school. Also starring Erin Moriarty as Claire, Missi Pyle as Ellen and Steve Zahn as Dave. Mortensen gives a terrific performance as the left-wing dad who is not afraid to tell the truth to his children, no matter what the subject, it is not just a road trip movie, it satirises many commercial, consumerist and corporate things, including the family shunning Christmas, it is well written and it works well as a funny feel-good film, but with the necessary serious subjects as well, a worthwhile comedy drama.

It is about choosing to live an examined life – moment by moment, and, more than that, about how one might raise children to join with you in examining their lives as well. Toss in a very rocky landscape of plot devices and near-insurmountable obstacles (symbolized at one point by the sheer rock face that the family climb together as a unit --- great scene, by the way, and one of many). As the story unfolds, the family fall under the microscope while undergoing what for them is the ultimate stress test --- a journey to their mother's parents' home in New Mexico. Join Captain Fantastic and his six children on their quirky and tragic, yet ultimately illuminating and liberating road trip across the consciousness of America (as it were). I think I could not have been anything but endeared to a family who discuss string theory as a home school assignment around the campfire at night and celebrate Noam Chomsky Day as an alternative to Christmas, and as an occasion for the exchange of paleo-lifestyle themed gifts.

Dad Ben (Viggo Mortensen) is bringing up his six kids – Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai – in the wilds of Washington state. Ben takes home-schooling to a completely new level, with intense study and examinations in quantum physics, philosophy and politics matched with a militaristic approach to weapons-training and physical fitness. Ben also teaches extreme self-sufficiency, most evident during a dramatic rock- climbing sequence.Where is their mum in all of this? That would be a spoiler (so don't watch the trailer either) but is central to the plot as the family board their old camper van – ""Steve"" – on a road trip back to the 'real world' and the children's grandparents – the crusty and assertive Jack (a marvellous Frank Langella) and Abigail (Ann Dowd). What follows is filled with black humour, tragedy, not just one but two amazing funeral services and one of the most extraordinarily black and comic laying-to-rests ever seen on the big screen. Viggo Mortensen is well fantastic in his portrayal, getting to run the full gamut of joy, grief, self-doubt, guilt and despair during the movie's run-time. He's clearly not going to win the Oscar on Sunday – surely Casey Affleck must be a slam-dunk for that – but this is a well-judged nomination by the Academy. While the focus is on Mortensen, this shouldn't overshadow the performances of some of the rest of the young cast, and I would specifically call out those of George MacKay and young Shree Crooks as the youngest of the kids. MacKay has been building up an impressive run of UK-based films with ""Sunshine on Leith"" and ""Pride"" but with this (and his key role in the recent TV mini-series ""11.22.63"") he should see a break-through to more mainstream feature roles. In ""Captain Fantastic"" his socially-inept proposal to the delectable Claire (Erin Moriaty) is one of the high-points of the film. He is a name to watch, for sure.And young Ms Crooks should be given a special honorary Oscar for the ability to learn such dense portions of script and deliver them so faultlessly! The whole cast in fact was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture – one of my favourite award categories, but beaten by ""Hidden Figures"". And it is that sort of film: a really great ensemble effort.The film is written and directed by Matt Ross, only his second feature since 2012's ""28 Hotel Rooms"" (which I was not aware of, but would now like to seek out). I thought it was terrific; deeply comedic; riveting from beginning to end; a roller-coaster of emotion and ultimately a feelgood classic on the value of family that I will remember fondly for a long time. Once again, the second film this week, that would have made me reconsider my ""top films of 2016"" list. I strongly recommend that you seek this out on download or DVD and give it a try.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."
" You'll like it if you aren't a die hard patriot
",0.7133,0.9876,2017-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie far more than I anticipated. I won't go into depth about it really, but I did want to comment in particular about the other user reviews I read about it. I found that this movie is seemingly very polarizing in that people who didn't love it seemed to hate it for the most part. However, the overarching reasons that haters of this film have in common are that they all get extremely angered by what they deem as glorifying the father's political and social ideals. They furthermore seem to all think that the costly extremes of the father's lifestyle that he imparts on his children don't ever get denounced enough. I find the fact that everyone who gave this movie a 1/10 did so because they take offense to their interpretation of its message both laughable and misguided. When someone gives a movie a 1/10 on here simply because they didn't agree with the movie's message (more accurately, THEIR INTERPRETATION of the message), then he/she essentially proves him/herself to be a completely unreliable source of objective opinion regarding a film's quality in direction, cinematography, acting, storytelling, etc. And it's potentially a shame because I'm not sure how a movie's overall IMDb score is tallied, but if user reviews are a part of the equation at all, then this movie was dragged down by the haters who can't put their own politics aside and judge a movie on its merit beyond that. Yes, the protagonists are a family of off-the-grid ""hippies"" for lack of a better term, whose father seems to carry a socio-political ideology which he influences upon his kids which is ultimately anti-corporate America and against big business, commercialism, overzealous capitalism, and organized religion. So what? So the movie drags on and on because you don't agree with that line of thinking? That's ridiculous. There are all sorts of movies that I don't like because I don't like the subject matter or the main character, but I would never say that they're awful because of it. Grow up! So I will say that for me in particular, while I am a Democrat and definitely left-leaning in my politics, I'm certainly not a ""Maoist"" or ""Trotskyist"" as the eldest son proclaims early in the film. Yet, surprisingly enough, I found this film to be excellent all around. The acting was very good, which is always more precarious of a situation when the movie is so children-heavy. Though most of the kids are older kids, it's always still a potential drag if a movie's main character(s) is a minor. These kids are all very good actors. The shots of the land that the family lives on are beautiful, and made me wish I could go back to the Pacific Northwest for another visit. The casting beyond the family is great too. I'm a big fan of Ann Dowd any time she snags a supporting role, and Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn are indie champions. Overall, it's a film well worth a viewing. And if you're a Republican who's a Sam's Club member, perhaps watch it and then come on here and give it an objective review, and represent your kind better by proving you can watch this film without being so over sensitive about whatever message you think it's pushing, and maybe even enjoy yourself;)"

" Your time is better spent reading a good book
",0.7003,0.6253,2017-03-06 00:00:00,1,"My first movie review is not how I had imagined it. Instead of raving about some great movie I'd seen, I'm instead warning you off this flick. The opening scene where the family participates in the hunt for wild game as food (complete with mud cammo to hide their faces and depress their scent) came off way too much like Lord of the Flies. The killing of the deer was very graphic and eating the bloody, raw liver as some pagan spiritual ritual between hunter and deer was a real turn off. It went downhill from there.I could spend several more paragraphs describing all the things about the film that I really disliked, but in reality, I stopped watching about half-way thru and read a good book while my wife finished watching it. I did however look up when Viggo Mortensen was presenting the full frontal Monty for about five seconds. Now we know.In summary: save yourself the rental fee and the two hours watching this could be better spent with a good book.PS - One more thing, Hollywood again chose to paint Christianity as being chock full of brainless shills and nasty people. Really? Payback will be a real bear when it comes."
" Could Have Been Good
",0.4404,0.9774,2017-03-05 00:00:00,5,"I am a Viggo fan so had high hopes for this film. I definitely respect those that choose a more rustic lifestyle and the burdens it carries without modern amenities. I also appreciated how the dad in the film prioritized education which is sorely lacking in our schools today. But began to question the direction the film was taking when one of the children pulls a knife on the father upon hearing about the mothers death. It is also hard to listen to the dad's soapbox about their superior lifestyle one minute, but then leads the children in robbing a store the next. The kids obviously have amazing book knowledge but are completely socially inept. I find it interesting that wilderness survivors love their solitude hating society and the economy until they need medical care or some home repairs. Then society all of the sudden has its benefits! I lost interest in this movie rather quickly."
" Excellence Undercut by Ending
",0.6249,0.714,2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I don't need to repeat what most other people say. The movie is profound, thought-provoking, beautifully shot, and well-acted. What I would comment is that the biting social commentary is somewhat undermined by its ending. SPOILERS AHEAD, the father has a very different world-view than mainstream society, and mocks the institution for brainwashing society into their paradigm of 'right and wrong,' but one of the nuanced ironies of the film is that he himself did that with his kids, and his sons discover this towards the end of the movie. That was such a powerful moment, and when he drives away without his kids, and shaves his face, that would have been such a powerful ending, but the movie decides for a cop-out happy ending, where the kids forgive him, he learns his lesson, and his world-view changes. The unearthing and burning of the mother's body was not triumphant, it was hokey. When the eldest son decides to go to Namibia, he says he just ""put his finger on the map,"" which is fairly ridiculous, considering he obviously has learned about every country and should know that in such a place he could make a difference. Cutting back to the father, seeing that he has found balance in his life totally contradicted his world-view, which was that consumer society is completely rotten and has nothing of value. Now, I may be saying a lot about the ending, but the movie itself is spectacular. Like I said, it has thought-provoking social commentary, and has the power to inspire a generation of new parents to end some of our societal hypocrisy and teach valuable life-skills and lessons to our children. What made this so much more memorable is the fact that it's set against the stark backdrop of Mortensen's character's extremist ideals. The movie was genius, while the ending was disappointing."

Its only purpose was an attempt at self-serving humor but we know in real life he would (hopefully) be charged with public indecency and probably put on some sex offender registry (unless he claimed some special victim status)."

To dispute several Oscars re 2016 was an obvious prank from the activist Academy that decided to combat the ""trumpamaro chaos"" that now prevails in the US. But the film serves to lift & renew some real emotions - of disgust, basically - as well as to uplift that old, picturesque discussion on what would be a right-wing, a center or a left-wing film. The ""author's message"" says that the anti-hero proves social Darwinism as he proves to be a fittest survivor who trains the family to survive ""savage capitalism."" In fact, I do not condemn, on the contrary I do approve homeschooling. However, how to promote homeschooling without resources like labs and computers in order to properly prepare the offspring for a future where high technology will be ubiquitous? An all-knowing, adult educated daddy who encourages and trains his children to steal would hardly qualify as civilized. The production, of course, can be labeled far-left (it's nihilist, trotskyist, anarchist, anti-Christian, libertarian, etc.) but one must always distinguish between leftward and simply sinister films...

" The wild family union
",0.0,0.9958,2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"""Fantastic Captain"" is one of those movies that are fun to watch, it's fun, it's funny, it's almost an adventure, and even then, it's complex and it deals with controversial themes and taboos, all sarcastic and half-hearted. The film is about a subject that documentary channels love to explore, a family that prefers to live in the jungle, away from the pleasures or not of the city, but cool, is the way the script approaches the film, the family in question is The one of Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and its 6 children, that after receiving the news of the death of the mother, decide to go to the funeral of the same, and in the mean time, diverse questions are put, twists, dramas and comedies they happen. It is a simple but beautifully crafted script that explores the contemplation of images to form its background. The film is placed in an ideological position, and it rests on it, I will not talk about this part because it does not attract me, your message to me is about the union of the family, and the power that it acquires by being together, battling and overcoming challenges, And of course, we have a criticism of the traditional teaching method, because Well proves that the education given at home can overcome that of a school because it treats the individuality of each student. With a clean photograph and a strong color palette, camera angles that in moments explore contemplation, a beautiful costumes and a great rhythm, ""Fantastic Captain"" is not a technically exquisite, but very good. In terms of acting the film presents us with Viggo Mortensen who does a first class performance, he is loving and brutal, violent and worried, Viggo conveys spectacularly all the doubts and questions about whether what his character is doing. Another highlight is for George Mackay who is quite stunning as Bem's eldest son, and deserved at the very least to be among the preselected Oscar as a supporting actor. Matt Ross, who has always been a serial actor, and has never been featured as an actor, now gets his spotlight on his first job as a director, let's keep an eye on what's coming from Matt. Finally, ""Fantastic Captain"" is not a prime, but it is a film that manages to entertain and pass on a message, like a good script and great performances."
" This movie is Self Aware
",0.0,0.9888,2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"This review was spawned in part as a reaction to the review on Roger Ebert's website - a ridiculous butchering which criticized this movie based on the fact that she didn't like the main character and can't seem to accept such a thing as a non-one-dimensional character. I see that other reviewers have a similar problem grasping the idea that a flawed man can have redeeming qualities and that modern life presents conundrums which cannot neatly be resolved within the time span of an hour and a half.Captain Fantastic is not the most masterful of its kind (it lacks the depth, writing, and laughs of, say, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Sideways"", films in a similar vein, IMO) but is still well worth watching. Viggo Mortenson is superb in this role, the kids are all uniquely awesome, it bumbles along nicely and it's food for thought throughout. The ending made me cry - family performance of ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" will truly go down in time for me; extraordinarily touching - from the children singing about their mother as being a ""sweet child"", to the moment the song turns upbeat (showing the absurdity of forced sadness at funerals) to the way in which her ashes were disposed - wonderful.On to my main point: I would argue that one of the major themes RUNNING THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE is that the dad, Ben, is a VERY flawed man, who does things that are very obviously wrong, to the point where his obtuse nature may or may not have been the deciding factor in his wife's suicide (!!!) yet he is not exactly a bad guy, either. The difficulty of assessing his integrity and whether or not he's ""good"" or ""bad"" is essentially why this movie exists.Can you kind of sort of get that?!Examples: when Rellian apologizes to his father for rebelling against him and vilifying him, to which Ben says, ""I love you"" instead of ""i'm sorry,"" Sheila, my parents never apologized for any of the things they did to me, and 95% of the time that I said sorry to them when I was a child, I had not really done anything wrong. Should my parents have said sorry for all the things they've done? YES. Was it within their emotional capacity? No. That is part of life. People can't be more or less than who they are. The film is not trying to say that Rellian was wrong for rebelling, or that Ben was right in that (or any) instance. I don't know how someone who saw it so naively is writing professional movie reviews. There's no question: Ben is a dictator, and he absolutely imposes his controversial views and values (not to mention lifestyle) on his children - just like countless other dads throughout history - we understand Rellian, but there are still very good reasons for the children to stay loyal to their dad and to each other regardless. Instead of clicking your tongue, why not contemplate the complexities of the parent-child relationship, the age old quandary of how sometimes the worst parents churn out the best kids, so maybe parents might as well just be who they really authentically are and trust that their children will turn out OK.The other significant scene is when the little Zaja is able to explain to his quite-a-bit-older cousins, being raised in a ""normal"" household, the finer details concerning the Bill of Rights, which they know nothing about (though Ben's kids are similarly clueless when it comes to matters of pop culture). This occurs during a family dinner where the clash between the lifestyle and values of the two families has become very apparent. Viewers saw this as smug; yes, I recognize how this would be a knee-jerk reaction. However, I think the scene was well-done, and one was actually more inclined to sympathize with Ben's sister Harper, who is duly embarrassed but in no way made to look like some kind of fool. We all know that that the average American teens aren't able to explain stuff like that, even though they ""should"" - yes, it's excessive that Zaja is as informed on political matters as she is, but it's as much of a salute to how much more you can teach kids when you take them out of the toxic public school environment and give them the one on one learning each kid deserves as it is a blatant display of Ben's aggressive focus on politics. Does a 6 year old kid need to be able to give such a detailed report about the Bill of Rights? No. Should Dave and Harper's teen sons have known a bit more about the Bill of Rights? Yes. I don't believe the film takes sides in that scene - it was meant to provoke thought.Finally, regarding Leslie's dad, Grandpa Jack who regards Ben as a toxic hippie who is basically responsible for his daughter's suicide and should have his kids taken away from him: yes, we all understand his stodgy viewpoint, and admittedly that the fact that he tried to disallow Ben and the gang from attending Leslie's funeral had us rooting for the underdogs. But Jack wasn't portrayed as a fool. He was shown the respect he deserved, and acted/thought the way millions of dads naturally would given the circumstances. I wouldn't blame him, and Ben doesn't, really - actually, he shows evidence of partially agreeing with him, of considering his criticisms and taking them to heart (especially during his final goodbye to Leslie). However, Ben is within his rights not to grant Jack all of his wishes, either.Naive people who can't see beyond ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" need to go back to fairy tales or at the very least, blockbusters, and leave honest critical appreciation of real movies to people who can see beyond black and white."

I am still unsure whether the kids, apart from Bo who still lived the first years of his life in society, were even registered but maybe I missed that or it just wasn't important to the story.When I first read the blurb for some reason I figured this was a movie featuring wild children who pretty much only knew how to survive and whose parents maybe taught them how to read. Instead, I am presented to a father who does his best to, yes, teach them how to survive in the wild, but also educate them and get them to think for themselves. These children are cunning and some of their conversations left me dumbfounded.The movie evolves with a series of emotionally packed scenes, particularly following their mother's illness and subsequent death. Some events are full of teenage angst and you can definitely see the dynamics changing, with Ben keeping to his beliefs while being open to to something different as long as it is properly argumented.Everyone is just plain brilliant in their performances, both main and supporting actors. Viggo Mortensen is amazing. You can clearly see this father's struggle to come to terms with the fact that what he believed was best for his children may not actually be so.Whoever cast these children – kudos. I was particularly awestruck with the eldest and the two youngest, but in general everyone was so darn expressive. I cannot even conceive how such young children could possibly memorize such lines while maintaining natural facial and body expressions. My chin actually dropped during some scenes.I cannot really say much more without spoiling the movie for you. Captain Fantastic is simply amazing.

" Outrageously unbelievable but the message is fine
",0.25,0.9669,2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"I never bought into this film's world of a delusional isolationist utopia and the obese capitalist automatons filling the outside world they fled from. It's used as a joke (how dumb this country is!) and as a way of courting empathy through the shared sense of superiority the audience has following this family as the protagonist. It's also outrageously unbelievable -- the kids all know like 6 languages, have read all great works of literature, play instruments, are up to date on all monthly periodicals and science magazines, oh right and outrageously fit and well-fed and know how to hunt and farm and THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY! And the hypocrisy of their lifestyle going mostly unchallenged...But that's not really what this film is about. It's about dealing with grief in the best way you can, however that may be, other people's beliefs and their customs be damned. You're allowed to feel how you want and deal with it as you please.

The fact that this is discussed/argued very openly (often more dictated to Viggo Mortensen's main protagonist, Ben, by disgruntled family members et al.) on-screen provides a fantastic – excuse the pun – philosophical debate around the issues of raising children; and perhaps more importantly, how we live our lives. But Captain Fantastic is by no means ham-fisted in its approach; rather opting to present moments of genuine conflict with its central argument, as opposed to bludgeoning the audience to death with stern finger wagging (it is hard not to grin though when 'home-schooled', nearly-8-year-old Zaja relentlessly tortures her aunt – played by Katherine Hahn – on her stance on public schooling; through first reciting, then providing detailed analysis of the Bill of Rights). Sweet (at times), torturous, emotionally raw and powerful; Matt Ross' film is a truly delightful piece of cinema."

The idea is so amazing !!

" Wonderful cinematography, relevant subjects, and great performances. What else?
",0.8316,0.9985,2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Perhaps questionable parenting choices are central to this remarkable piece of cinematography, but there is a lot more to read between the lines. Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, a wholeheartedly dedicated father of six children, raising them in the wild, whilst paradoxically providing them with extensive knowledge on subjects such as philosophy, politics, or physics - possibly achieving a close to perfect balance between a sane mind and a strong body.The drama materializes as Ben's wife commits suicide, thereof surfacing the profound divergences between her parents and Ben's way of life (primeval at first sight, but distinctly intricate, focused on a deep respect for both nature and a free human spirit). ""We created paradise"", says Ben once, referring to the haven he and his wife had created for their children, set in the dazzling forests of the Pacific Northwest - also beautifully captured on camera, for our cinematic pleasure.I was amazed at the way Matt Ross, the director, brought to the screen such an authentic family (very well casted) in quite an unusual fix, living in a somewhat parallel world apart from most of the societal norms.On the one side, there are Ben's kids, educated in a fully disclosed and frank fashion, to be critical and secular people, respecting and cherishing what nature gives them. On the other side, revealing a typical American family (I'd guess, not being American), Matt captures the dynamic of Ben's sister household, where children are depicted as somewhat ignorant, rude, and essentially unconcerned with anything beyond their video games. The ""normal"" parents are overprotective, trying to hide the true nature of pretty much anything considered inappropriate (however adequate the violent content of video games is). The hypocrisy is flagrant.Thus, it is, for me, precisely in that contradiction that lies the crux of the matter on this film: how much good are we doing, as (perhaps well-intentioned) educators, by covering everything up around deceitful concepts, so as to supposedly protect children from everything? At the same time, how come are we entitled to force our beliefs, traditions and social behaviour on our descendants?Ben's dead wife, a former Buddhist, was put through a Christian funeral and burial by her parents (which a relentless, narrow-minded father really insisted on), in spite of having left an explicit request to be cremated. How often does this happen in real life? Too often, I believe.Despite the deeper subjects, there's room for moments of hilarious satire, that provide the film with an interesting balance between joy and reflection.I felt like overall, the performances were splendid: the older son, Bo (played by George MacKay), vividly captured an interesting balance between gullibility and brightness; the other brothers and sisters skilfully assembled a very compelling family, for which you truly cared throughout the whole film; and Mortensen, finally, did his part brilliantly, conveying a wide range of emotions with such an on-screen ease that you rarely see. Regardless of getting the Oscar this year, his performance was unforgettable.To sum up, ""Captain Fantastic"" is definitely worth watching, especially because of how it inspires you to find the (lost) connection with Nature, and leave the petty unnecessary stuff behind. It's surely a reminder of how disconnected from the fundamentals of life we've become. The good thing is: it offers you an alternative."

",0.7579,0.9346,2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Captain Fantastic takes us to an inspiring universe where we are driven to question our very own values, views and way of seeing life. Ben, a loving father of 6 children, has raised them in a natural landscape, far from the claws of capitalist society. And through intensive physical training, knowledge of politics, philosophy and other sciences he and his wife gave their children a perfect education according to their beliefs and perspective. All this is threatened to change as some challenges force them to shock with the ""real world"". Viggo Mortensen did a spectacular job and took the deepness of his character to another level. The movie is moving and has left me quite a bit to contemplate and think about."

I really didn't identify with any of the main characters in this, instead they just flat out annoyed me, especially when they referred to Christmas as ""celebrating a magical fictitious elf""-which made me roll my eyes pretty hard. I actually ended up identifying/agreeing with the antagonist the most.This is probably the most leftist movie I've ever seen. A lot of it felt like it was shaming American culture because it's a trendy thing to do and never really gave much of an actual reason for these characters hating society. I think it was trying to say something about society but it never seemed to actually end up making its point. At one point it suggested that 13 year olds don't know what the bill of rights is, which is incredibly false. I learned about the constitution at 11, much like every other American kid. The whole thing felt a bit too long as well and could have been condensed into an hour and a half instead of two.The movie did make me laugh, whether it was intentional or not. The conversation between the older brother and the girl at the trailer park was incredibly contrived and pathetic I couldn't stop laughing. Additionally I thought Sweet Child o Mine was really well done and enjoyable at the end."

And that's just how one Ben(Viggo Mortensen)is looked at and displayed during this film. Anyway Ben is a rugged bearded outdoor guy who's raising his six kids in the woods and wild of the Washington state forest among the evergreens! And Ben learns the kids a lot like living off the land and hunting game for food and schooling them by having them to read books and teaching his own thoughts and behavior. Then their world is turned upside down when they receive a call that the kids mother has taken her own life. So out of the woods now and it's a journey to the real world and the kids are faced with challenges of living different and it's a challenge to Ben to be a parent as his father in law the tough and arrogant Jack(Frank Langella)is about to make things tough. Still thru it all love and support is within Ben and it still proves that doing it your way can work for love and life and happiness in the end, overall good showcase film that shows difference and what it's like to go against the grain and live against the norm."

Not because parents want to educate their children in their own way, no, that seems great, but because of the things that are said in the movie to children of that age.I have to say that as a movie, it is credible. You believe everything, that's the bad. It's not a bad movie, but I'm terrified that there are people like that, that will lead your child to do that sort of thing.I do not like Viggo Mortensen, but he's an actor who does not like anything, if someone bothers me, I beg your pardon. The kids however are great.I think the film defends some things, but at the same time it falls on themselves, it is very incoherent.Photography, nothing special. It is simple and does not count anything.The address is simple. Do not bore, the planes are simple.I hope not to disturb anyone with my comments, they are just that, comments.Spoiler:The sequence when he asks the child in front of the uncles to show that the child knows a lot of culture, seems to me unfortunate. The bad thing is that in the movie, the aunt is right. And as a counterpoint, the children of the uncles are the typical video games, who know nothing, all clichés. Is it really what people want their children to learn at that age?Telling the child, what the brother tells him when he is going to take the plane, it seems to me as much as training the masses, which is precisely what I believe denounces the film."

" It made me think - and that's a good thing
",0.4404,0.9948,2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"I had an interesting struggle while watching CAPTAIN FANTASTIC.  My head wanted to reject this film, particularly the methods the father (Viggio Mortensen in an Oscar nominated performance) uses to raise his children.  My heart pushed back hard, telling my head to ""release pre-conceived thoughts and ideas and accept the film - and methods - on the terms that the filmmakers intended"".  And when I did that, a funny thing happened...I enjoyed the film.Directed and Written by Matt Ross, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC tells the story of Ben Cash, who chooses to raise his 6 children ""off the grid"" away from the trappings of Modern Society.  When his wife passes away, Ben must bring his children ""in"" and, in the process, re-examines the choices he has made and the effects it has had on his kids.Viggio Mortensen is nominated for an Academy Award for his lead performance as Ben - and it is a deserving nomination.  This is not a ""showy"" role.  It is sincere, thoughtful and deep - you can see there is much, much more going on inside of Ben under his skin - even though he is calmly secure in the lifestyle decisions he has made.  When, however, that security is tested (shaken?), you see a subtle shift in Mortensen's performance that is pitched exactly as it should, not too much and not too little.  He delivers a fine, subtle performance that works.A key to this film is the casting of the 6 young actors as Ben's children - and they are cast well.  These 6 look like they could be brothers and sisters, without looking like clones of each other or as if they came straight out of central casting.  They all have separate and distinct personalities while also showing the bond that, necessarily, has formed between these 6 throughout the years.Where this film falls short is in the writing of the others (like Ben's sister and her family and Ben's Father in Law) that Ben's family encounters when they leave their mountain sanctuary for their mother's funeral.  These characters are written 2 dimensionally with little to no understanding or curiosity of Ben's choices.  Thankfully, the sister is played by the underrated Katherine Hahn while the Father-In-Law was saved from being a Darth Vader-type villain by Frank Langella's natural strength and compassion, even though he was asked to ""twirl his mustache"" most of the time.  Only Annie Ross as Ben's mother-in-law comes off as a three dimensional character.And that is often a concern when a film is written and directed by the same person.  It is clear that Ross LOVES his main character and his family, so everyone else is put on the screen as antagonists or to give the main family a chance to shine.  This also results in some long, slow scenes of the family thinking or slowly discussing an issue, to such an extent that I started fidgeting in my seat.But, when that happened, I would just focus on Mortensen and the kids performances and I was entertained, indeed.  This movie made me think, and that is rare and welcome.Letter Grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"

His commitment generates both awe and hesitation. His charismatic obsession leads one to follow him but also to call child's services. The kids are just as terrific.

" My personal favorite of the year
",0.4588,0.9976,2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I'd say it's only minor spoilers, but I'll be careful and tag it.Being a sucker for movies that end on...let's say at least a good note, this was one of the most satisfying movies of the year, a real feel-good show. There were many other high-rated movies (that I'm not going to spoil here) this year that I ultimately enjoyed less because of their endings while still really appreciating them otherwise. Biased opinion, but I claim nothing else. Viggo Mortensen is probably my favorite actor due to many amazing performances and movies. It was clear he would choose his next movie very carefully after, as usual, turning down roles for several blockbusters in the last couple years. It took him long enough to find something that he felt like doing and his choice was great. Imagine him being wasted in something like Avengers when he can work on gems like these. I'm glad he got recognized once more with an Academy Award nomination among several other ones.The movie itself is something really rare in the way it casually ridicules certain aspects of our lives and it absolutely hits the right spot in most of the chosen occasions. The church scene was probably my favorite scene of the year. A family that couldn't be much more oddly looking comes into a church to participate in the funeral ceremony of their wife and mother and is stared at by everyone else...dressed in black and white, with their bibles in hand, singing religious songs...and in this moment the question rises WHO exactly the weird ones in this situation are. That kind of scenario, which is depicted in several other scenes throughout, is the most intriguing thing in the movie for me. What the movie does not want to do is trying to convince people that everything the father does is right and should be followed like some people in the comment section seem to think. This is made pretty damn obvious in certain scenes like the one in the supermarket, which not everyone gets, but not everyone will perceive the church scene the same way I did either...sadly. If you're none of those people though, there's a good chance you'll really appreciate this very creative piece."

I had managed to avoid all trailers for it and decided not to even read the synopsis before watching it. Basically the poster was all I had to go by, which didn't offer a tremendous amount as you'd expect. Then the film began and I got a little worried. These were not the type of people I could easily relate to, and that can sometimes make for a hard viewing experience. However, it turned out that there in lied the film's biggest strength. You don't have to be able to be able to relate to them, because you can understand them. Once I realised this, it turned into quite a truly beautiful film.Viggo Mortensen has been nominated for Best Actor in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards and it couldn't be more deserved. He absolutely sold me. The type of character he was playing could so very easily come across as unlikable, and yet Mortensen never allows that to happen. Instead, the audience is always on his side and he is a huge part in them being able to understand the characters motivations and actions. The entire cast was absolutely fantastic it would have to be said. With this many young/child actors and actresses, how they avoided any weak link is beyond me, but it is a fantastic effort.'Captain Fantastic' is a very powerful film. The subject matter is heavy and it is handled absolutely perfectly by writer/director Matt Ross. It never feels like his sole motivation is to effect us an audience, and yet he manages to with a combination of some quite beautifully done scenes and some tremendous character interaction. I was absolutely sold by this film and I suspect most people who watch it will be too. One not to be missed."

The depiction of joyful children and teenage siblings happy to live with each other in a remote location. with no contact with other children is a fantasy indeed, and if it were true, would represent pathological behaviour. This movie is a good candidate for those funny recut movies- you know, the recut that turned Mrs Doubtfire into a horror movie? I don't think it will take someone long to add a horror music score on top of the final ""blissful family"" scene at the end, to portray the truth. Hilarious! Would be good fun to analyse the adolescent psychopathology and the powerlessness of the children as depicted in this movie in lectures.

He is persuaded to do that job by himself because he suddenly loses his wife and remains with his six children.What really amazed me was that a man can do such a good job as a parent. It is delightful seeing such obedience, respect, trust and love between a father and children. Even though the conditions in which the kids are growing up are, let's just say, alternative, it is unavoidable to notice such a wonderful harmony.I agree this topic can cause controversies. Law is conservative and sensitive when it comes to parenting because the first assumption is a downgrading result of children's perspectives and it is quite difficult to prove the opposite. We disapprove choices the individuals make while raising children, instantly presuming that those choices are wrong and doing damage to them. The truth is that those children grow up stronger and smarter than most of their peers nowadays.The main question opens up: Did we do ourselves a disservice when we developed high technology and exposed it to children, making it the only source of fun? Has the commercialization strongly pressured our lives that we don't even know what's essential? Is a human evolution in general going backwards? The fact is the kids are miserable going to school and see it as a painful obligation, not as an opportunity to broaden their potential young minds. It is definitely something the world needs to work on.Anyway, the movie deserved a 10/10 from me and certainly made my top 10 of all time movies, maybe even top 5.

" Slanted liberal claptrap loved by pompous critics
",0.4019,-0.9966,2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"**Some major spoiler action**While a liberal fantasy about a father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen, ""Far From Men,"" ""Lord Of the Rings"" trilogy), with no filter, raising his eclectic brood of six in the North woods may cause a great majority of film critics to go into hysterics, it's as a pompous and pretentious an exhibition ever put on film. Self-styled intellectual movie reviewers (many of whom probably feel the same way about the general movie-going public as Mortensen's character feels about everyone) are falling all over themselves to honor a man whose mentally ill wife commits suicide-partially because of Ben's isolationist, environmental, elitist lifestyle. Let's face it, Ben is an overbearing douche-bag with no redeeming qualities, whatsoever, and we the audience have to sit through and digest a film which concludes with the theft of a dead body and a terrible rendition of Guns N Roses' ""Sweet Child Of Mine."" This was truly one of THE worst movies of 2016, with no exceptions. We are introduced to the family when the oldest of six bizarrely-named children, Bodevan (George MacKay, ""Private Peaceful""), kills a deer with his bare hands, while Ben makes him eat the heart to become a man. The movie then proceeds to go downhill from there, if that's even anywhere conceivable. Since he says what on his mind and seemingly does not care what comes out of his mouth (diplomacy and tact are definitely NOT in his vocabulary), we have to listen to him pontificate on how America is an evil corporate entity and hear his robotic children echo the same left-wing claptrap over and over again. In addition, he forces them to run through the forest, climbs rock faces and glaciers, steal food, insult people, talk back to their elders, disrespect people who do not agree with their bohemian lifestyle and to just be obnoxious brats. They then find out that their mother committed suicide after being institutionalized, but Ben is told by his angry father-in-law (the eternally angry Frank Langella (Academy Award- nominated for ""Frost-Nixon"") not to show up. But of course, since it's in the script and we need to see the family outside of their mountainside hermitage, the troupe makes the trek to New Mexico in a school bus stolen from the ""Partridge Family"" TV show. En route, they rip off a grocery store (while dad fakes a heart attack); go into a restaurant, sit down, receive menus and the abruptly leave when they discover that food is served there; outwit a redneck policeman and show Ben stepping off the bus totally naked (although he later sports an equally offensive ""Jesse Jackson 88"" shirt - who helped co-write this nonsense, Al Gore?) There is also no shame in this guy as he tells a 6-year old girl about intercourse (even giving her the book, ""Joy Of Sex"") and lectures his nephews on how smart his children are compared to them and their dopey parents (if I wanted to be condescended to by leftist morons, I'd simply watch CNN or MSNBC or any of the major networks' newscasts). He also forces his offspring to celebrate the birthday of liberal socialist writer, Noam Chomsky. Few children have ANY idea WHO Chomsky is, but to prove the leftist leanings of the film's writer/director, Matt Ross (""28 Hotel Rooms""), it's a major part of the film. The kids are even given dangerous knives and other weapons to ""celebrate"" the occasion. Then, when one of the children questions this stupidity, the father shames him into arguing intellectually against ""Noam Chomsky Day"" (hey, Matt, I could give you about 50 reasons, but no one asked my opinion). None of these ludicrous activities evidently seem to cause ANYONE to blink an eye, but the crazed Ben finally goes overboard when he crashes the funeral, stands up and does a comedy routine (left-leaning comedians are NOT funny and neither is this blather) and tells everyone that his late wife was a Buddhist and wanted to be cremated (instead of buried).Finally, the father-in-law (as well as all of us) has had enough and calls security. Told in no uncertain terms that he will NOT be welcome to the interment ceremony. In the meantime, Bodevan has been accepted to every Ivy League college in existence, yet cannot even make simple conversation with anyone outside of his family and Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton, ""Strangerland""), who breaks his hand while rock climbing in the rain, tells his father he hates him and wants to live with his wealthy, stable grandparents (finally, one of the children sees the light). Motivated by this, the grandfather files for custody of the children so they might have a safe, normal life. Unfortunately, one of the non-descript teenage daughters tries to ""rescue"" the boy, falls off the roof and sustains serious injury, but once again, there are absolutely no consequences for this addled, horrible, neglectful parent. Worst yet, the children run away with this jerk and then they break into a cemetery, steal their mother's corpse and roasting it on a pile of logs. OK, I know I am writing WAY too much into this, but the logistics of a group of children digging up a body and removing it are staggering. Graves are dug with backhoes and most caskets are buried in concrete vaults to keep water and other material out. It takes these morons about two minutes to complete a task which would literally take hours. Much will also be made of the fact that Mortensen earned his second Academy Award nomination (his first was for ""Eastern Promises"" in 2007) for playing Ben. If pure hatred of a character is motivation for such an honor, then he deserves the statuette hands down. Grade: F"

Wonderful performances from Viggo Mortensen and the whole ensemble of his ""children"" (watch out in the future again for: George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell). This ""family"" invigorates the viewer with fresh voices speaking of freedom, change and at the same time of social and family values which we all tend to forget on a daily basis. Mortensen's character is both arrogant and loving to everybody around him which makes him really a nicely developed controversial person. It is refreshing for every viewer see such qualities together. I myself felt questioning many of the choices which I make as a parent. Which is a wise nod from the director to us all. Close community living and modern life technologies clash in front of the hippie background. The emotional connection is beautifully shot, using the metaphor of travel as the ultimate vessel for overpowering oneself. Any back to nature spirit will find something for itself in this movie. I think that this film is a carefully polished heartfelt jewel giving us a glimpse of what an emotional crisis looks like from a more subtle and graceful point of view. What touches us in this comedic drama is the thought-provoking youth performance which resonates with our every day struggle to find all the right answers to the question: What it really means to be a parent..."
" Modern society vs family.
",0.0,0.9914,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Captain Fantastic (2016), from director Matt Ross is a highly emotive family drama, which is special in it's own way, not like your average ""every day"" movie.It's about family that refuses to live by today's ""rules and standards"", and goes on to live in nature. Whole casting, along with main star Viggo Mortensen is fantastic! You really believe they are family, that takes you to a adventure with them, through self-discovery, inner fight with themselves for their way of life and philosophy, fight with others who don't agree with them, and possible mistakes. Movie establishes great question, which is: Is it better to be protected by lies or faced with the truth? And gives it's answer to that question. Vigo Mortensen (father) has his own inner fight in which he is faced with question is he a good father, would his children have better life without him.This movie is decorated by beautiful cinematography, because of beautiful shots of nature, but also there are shots of urban cities and industry, in comparison of those shots is point of this movie. And the point is: what means to be normal family and does normal family needs to fit in today's patterns of society, to be normal? Music in movie is also great, because in every moment it helps audience to awake feeling which director is aiming for. Movie is paced very well, and in it's 2 hours it never got boring.In conclusion beautiful film for whole family, that brings real values of life on screen, and shows audience what it means to be true family in both good and bad times."
" Everything is FANTASTIC about 'Captain Fantastic'!
",0.6833,0.9978,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"'Captain Fantastic' is not a super-hero movie, despite the title, but again, then maybe it is as we follow the journey of a big family, both emotionally and physically, as they stick together through some tough obstacles. Directed by Matt Ross, who is most known these days as Gavin Belson on HBO's 'Silicon Valley', 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare films that has just about everything you'd want in an emotional drama- comedy, which is all led by the amazing talent of Viggo Mortensen. The film is a refreshing mix of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' and 'Little Miss Sunshine' and plays to both of those films strengths, while still managing to be original, entertaining, and heart-warming. 'Captain Fantastic' sure has quickly become one of my favorite films of the year.Matt Ross sure has created a Utopian reality with this film when it comes to raising a family in an unconventional way. If all kids were raised more or less in the way depicted here in this film, things would be better, or at least that's what Ross wants you to think. In a perfect world maybe, but unfortunately this film is quite the fantasy, which is really the only minor gripe I have with the film. 'Captain Fantastic' follows a big family led by Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller), along with their six kids in rural Washington State. They home-school all of their kids in the forest, teaching them everything from deer hunting with a knife, canning vegetables and fruits, to all of the social and economic issues from the past and present.The kids know several languages fluently and can even play instruments. However, their mother has been in the city to get ""help"" for her bi-polar disorder, which ends unfortunately. This has Ben and his six kids on a road trip in a decked out hippie bus across country to attend their mother's funeral, despite Ben's father-in-law (Frank Langella) threatening to call the police if Ben and the kids show up, as he blames Ben for his daughter's death. On the road trip the family sticks together when others think they're weird for their intelligent yet awkward ways, including celebrating Noam Chomsky's birthday as their version of Christmas, stealing food from the grocery store, having the youngest kid (7 years old) recite the bill of rights and explain what it all means, and being up front and honest with people and each other when it comes to sensitive subjects that includes topics such a rape and death.It sounds rough, but Ross captures this family and a very innocent and charming light. Even though the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) can tell you about any literary classic in detail or talk astrophysics, he has no idea how to socialize with anyone his age on a normal level, even though he has applied to all the ivy league schools and has been accepted each of them. Things get a bit serious when an accident happens that makes Ben think twice on how he is raising his kids and must make a compromise with their way of life and living in the real world for everyone's safety.This journey is not only a physical one, but an emotional one as well, as each kid and Ben struggles with who they are and how they were raised. It's a very satisfying story to tell and to see on screen, as you grow more attached to each character with each passing minute, despite their quirks. One obstacle after another, this family really stays loyal and proves their worth to one another and society, even if it's so far- fetched that it is almost borderline fantasy. The music in the film by Alex Somers is captivating and Matt Ross captures the rugged countryside beautifully.Viggo Mortensen along with the six kids turn in phenomenal performances, but Viggo truly shines as a realistic portrayal of a father who is trying his best, given his choices and circumstances. If only we all had a part of Ben in all of us in life. 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare beautiful films that is pretty much flawless.MUST SEE!"
" Captains Courageous
",0.5267,0.9638,2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Having chosen to raise his six children ""off the grid"", an avid survivalist gradually realises how unprepared his kids are for the real world when they visit the city to attend a funeral in this comedy starring Viggo Mortensen. Early on, one of Mortensen's daughters provides an astute analysis of Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita', citing that the book is disturbing because you are positioned to sympathise with and care for a man whose actions are wrong. The same could curiously be said for this film and its 'hero'. Mortensen's Ben is motivated by all the right ideas regarding nonconformity, regular exercise, literature and so on, however, at the same time, he also encourages antisocial behaviour (stealing) and almost gets one of his daughters killed in a 'rescue mission'. Most tellingly, the kids cannot interact properly with others their own age, unaware of social conventions and oblivious to popular culture. Compelling as all this is, the film unfortunately only ever explores Ben's two oldest sons in any depth. The two eldest sisters are completely interchangeable, while his youngest son and daughter are only characterised by their own offbeat 'cute' habits: he likes to prance around naked; she likes to wear a gas mask. That said, George MacKay and Nicholas Hamilton are both solid as the two sons with well written characters, both of whom stand up to their father. Solid supporting performances from the likes of Frank Langella and Steven Zahn further ensure that the film has a solid dramatic backbone even if the way the film shies over the other four kids never quite feels right."
" Potency is power, but what is happiness?
",0.7096,0.9988,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"A man lives with his six children, age from 8 to around 18, in the woods, where he trains them as some utopian superhumans. But all goes sideways when the mother of the children and the man's wife kills herself...Do we like the world we live in? Do we wanna change it to the better, or there's no other way but to bend down and adapt? Well, Captain Fantastic is a story about people who had no illusions about the modern society surrounding them, so instead of letting it crook their lives and the lives of their children they decided to create their own small paradise, the triumphant kingdom of both physical and mental superiority. But it would be too simplistic to paint the story in just black and white, so to make our superkids a little more human the filmmakers gave them a flaw of being absolutely incapacitated socially. The whole movie then progresses by using that striking contrast as its driver until, eventually, it settles things to a seemingly reasonable consensus between the perfect ideas and the imperfect world those ideas have to be implemented in....There's a moment in this film when Viggo Mortensen's character asks his daughter to give her analysis of Nabokov's Lolita. She at first struggles to find the right words, saying ""it's interesting"". ""Be more specific"", he replies, because he tries to teach his kids to do more than just scratching the surface and being satisfied with simple answers.Well, finding the right words for this film might be an equally challenging task. And it's definitely a mixed bag of emotions and impressions. I like and admire the film for how beautifully it's made. The chemistry between the kids, more bound to each other now that they have nobody else to turn to, and their father, who's both an upholding pillar of their lives and a subject of their angst and frustration, is a never-ending source of wonder. Now that Viggo Mortensen's gradually ending his career as an action figure, seeing him go for the emotional complexity - and succeed at it - is quite a pleasure.What I don't find the pleasure in, however, is a typical loophole of giving the otherwise flawless characters a defect both huge and unlikely, using that trick to create something resembling a conflict the movie would be so desperately lacking otherwise. Why do children who can master quantum physics or military-grade physical training have to be so blatantly ignorant when it comes to the regular people's lives? Why would a kid know about the Supreme Court cases but have no idea what Nike or Coca Cola is? Why would a guy be speaking six languages but have no idea how to talk to a girl? It's not like the only books in this world are for nerds, we have social studies and psychological literature as well. Of course, if Ben's kids were reading those books too they would be Hanna-like complete (for those unaware who I refer to, please watch the 2011 film of the same name, it's really awesome in its own right). But that kind of perfection assumes a sense of purpose, something that we regular flawed people are entitled not to have or to struggle searching for, and something that turns a perfect human into something not entirely human but rather like a tool or a weapon. And the thing Ben's kids definitely don't have is a knowledge of what to do with such fantastically special selves.Maybe I'm over-analyzing and it's just my wishful thinking, but it really seems that behind the story of Captain Fantastic is a story of us all and the question we all seek the answer for: what is happiness and what's the way to achieve it? It's clear that the ""superkids"" in this film are superior to the most of us in terms of mental and physical development. But what's the point of all that potency? Does it make them happy? Do they feel better than the regular typical us simply because they are healthier, stronger or more educated? Or do they feel lonely and cast away from the society which finds unity in its common flaws and mistakes? Because those fat/lazy/shortsighted and basically ignorant people don't seem to suffer too much from their imperfections. Maybe they don't even realize their existence. Ignorance may be a real bliss sometimes.The only problem is that once you've gotten yourself above that bliss and saw the ugliness it grows from, no matter how much you try to go back you won't be able to get it back, you've come undone already. So the seemingly blissful finale of the film's story is nothing more than just a question: you have traded in your consistency, but have you gotten what you wanted, have you become happy for real? And come think of it, ignorance might not only be a source of bliss but the very single chance to achieve it..."
" Inspiring movie
",0.4215,0.9805,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Living of the grid. Living day to day without any obligations. One with nature and enjoying every single moment of life. It seems all so far away in these modern ages. But it could be doable for everybody who can say no to modern society. Captain Fantastic is a nice movie about that spirit of life. Forced to return to the modern life because of a funeral makes the isolated kids discover how they are supposed to live. Live by rules, rules that no one approves unless you're in the system. The movie is very entertaining to watch with nice scenery's and good actors. Even all the kids play their roles with much conviction. You could imagine them living like that in real life. I like those kind of movies, where you question modern day life, where you know people are just following the norm and just continue contributing to the rat race without them knowing anything else. Inspiring movie. Power to the people! Stick it to the man!"
" One of the more original films of the year.
",0.3804,0.9911,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"It's hard to keep up with movies throughout the year, but based on the consistent and steady buzz I have heard about CAPTAIN Fantastic ever since it's early summer release, I'm sure glad I finally got around to seeing it. It's a magical experience from beginning to end, full of surprises and wonder.The trailer certainly gives away some of the main plot points that move the story along. Our setup is quirky to say the least: a husband and wife decide to raise their 6 children in the woods away from the constant barrage of modern society and all it's vices. Here, they will be honest, will teach their children everything they are curious about, never say ""no"" and always strive for excellence. We meet the family just as word comes of the wife's death from an apparent suicide. Did I mention the story is equal parts heartwarming and heartbreaking?Ben (Viggo Mortensen) breaks the news to his children. It's a devastating loss of course, but the rift created between Ben and his in-laws forbids him from attending the funeral. Even though his children are fluent in 6 languages and know the Constitution of the United States by heart (including a thorough understanding of the text, no less), Ben's actions are seen as being harmful to his children. There is a threat that they will be taken away should they return to civilization.What works so well with the film is the cast of children. In any other movie, just one of these 6 performances would be hailed as a breakthrough of the year. Each child is unique, whip-smart, learned, and scene-stealers moment after moment. Yes the movie is a vehicle for Viggo Mortensen, but without the tact and skill of these actors around him he would be nothing. That's hard to say especially considering how fine of a performance he gives, maybe his best yet. Mortensen seems tailor-made for this role, expanding on a personality that is both understanding and at times a bit mad. There is a delicate balance between our understanding of this family dynamic and the possibility that he is perhaps committing child abuse after all. I think the last 30 or so minutes of the film demonstrate some of the strongest acting you will likely see all year, and I expect an Oscar nomination to follow.The other lead of the film is the character of Ben's oldest son, Bo (George MacKay). He's a leader like his father, no more than 18, but finds our more about his place in the world throughout the film. The family takes a large school bus named 'Steve' to rendezvous with the funeral, and the journey exposes Bo to the realities that his father have shielded them from. As smart as he is (and having been accepted to every Ivy League school in the country), he has no skills with talking to girls or talking to strangers. We sympathize with him wholeheartedly. Not everything can be found in a book.The screenplay is one of so many twists and turns. Matt Ross, the writer and director, has only made a handful of films and yet the skill on display is surely some of the most natural I have seen all year. It's a beyond clever story of hardened children who work to find a balance between two worlds. Not only did it move me to tears on more than one occasion, I also found myself amazed at how close this film comes to being a total farce. Think of the final scene where the family sings ""Sweet Child O Mine"" around a burning funeral pyre. How absurd it sounds out of context, and yet how marvelous it was to take a journey where that moment can be such a fulfilling climax. You would be hard-pressed to find a more original movie this year that is so overflowing with heart."
" Mortensen shines as survivalist parent despite awkward but forgivable denouement
",-0.395,0.9438,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"A few minutes into Captain Fantastic, you're beginning to believe this a true story. Actually it's not! According to writer/director Matt Ross, it's based on his experiences being raised by a mother whom he describes not as a hippie but more like an artisan, in rural areas way off the beaten path. And then there's Ross's experience as a parent himself. He melds both together and voila!—out emerges an indie ""dramedy"" wholly original in content and delivery.Viggo Mortensen, in a dynamic, award-winning performance, plays Ben Cash (aka Captain Fantastic), a survivalist parent who is committed to raising a brood of kids out in the wilderness in Washington State. Ben is an odd blend of a crazy Ted Nugent hunter-type who ""initiates"" his eldest son Bodevan into manhood by killing a deer and having him eat its heart and admirer of Noam Chomsky, who he honors with a ""Noam Chomsky Day"" in place of Christmas.The first third of the film reveals Ben to be scrupulously honest with his kids and never embarrassed to talk openly with them about such things as sexuality and issues of morality. His Achilles heel is that he pushes the kids too far on a physical level, and at one point his younger son, Rellian, seriously injures his hand during a rock climbing exercise.The break into the Second Act occurs when Ben learns that his estranged wife--hospitalized for bipolar illness and possible post-partum depression--commits suicide. Scrupulously honest Ben bluntly tells the children that their mother is dead and everyone naturally is quite broken up. The clan decides to attend their mother's funeral despite Ben being banned from showing up by grandfather Jack (sharply played by one of the stage and screen's most gifted actors, Frank Langella).The decision to leave the wilderness and mix with the denizens of the ""civilized"" world leads the children into a state of cognitive dissonance—just as they have contempt for many of the values of ""capitalist society,"" they also are attracted to the positive things that such a society has to offer. This especially holds true for Bodevan, whose sexual instincts are suddenly awakened, when he meets an attractive teenager from a trailer park who's enamored with his odd style of ""intellectual communication.""Unlike many indies today with their underdeveloped plots, Captain Fantastic actually has a narrative that features a suspenseful buildup to the dark moment at the end of the second Act. That occurs after Ben and family disrupt their mother's funeral and Ben orders daughter Vespyr to climb up Jack's roof in an effort to ""save"" Rellian, who has now sworn allegiance to his grandparents and rejected Ben for his purported lousy treatment of their mother. Vespyr falls off the roof and thankfully only sustains a concussion—the doctor at the hospital informs Ben that she was one inch from being killed or paralyzed.This incident causes Ben to realize that he was molding the kids in his own image and not allowing them to develop their potential naturally. He agrees to leave the kids with Jack and drives off believing he'll no longer be involved in raising them.Unfortunately Ross fails to tie up all the loose ends and we're left with a convoluted Act 3. It's all very awkward but somehow the kids change their mind about staying with grandpa and ensconce themselves under the floorboards of the family bus (including Vespyr, still in a cast!) And what about Jack? For some reason he doesn't bother notifying the police in order to try and regain custody of the children.Next the kids insist on traipsing over to the cemetery where they dig up their mother's body and cremate her according to the desires spelled out in her last will and testament (there's a real ""kumbaya"" moment as the children sing while their mother's corpse burns on their makeshift funeral pyre!). The ashes are also flushed down the toilet at an airport, also according to the mother's wishes. The family ends up still in ""Woodstock"" heaven, raising organic vegetables on a regular farm but now attending a school, no longer being home-schooled by Ben.It's sort of the too ""happy"", sentimental ending you'd expect from a film like this, but the rest of Ross's hippie narrative is so wonderfully original and quite a bit of it believable, that the awkward wrap-up hardly detracts from the film's overall rating, deserving of fairly high ratings in the Indie dramedy pantheon."
" Movie with an Initial Intriguing Premise Becomes Too Stupid to Bear
",-0.5267,0.9875,2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"There are compelling and relevant ideas swirling around the periphery of ""Captain Fantastic,"" but they are undermined by a terrible screenplay that gets more and more preposterous as the movie wears on.We are introduced to an absolutely unbearable family being raised by dad Viggo Mortensen as a bunch of sort of hippie survivalists. They live self-sufficiently out in the middle of nowhere, are forced to undergo family exercise regimens every day, and are taught by their father to be judgemental and morally superior to everyone who doesn't think and live exactly like them. Consumerist and capitalist America is the biggest target of their vitriol, and every a**hole remark they make or act they carry out is justified by the ambiguous belief that they are ""sticking it to the man,"" whatever that means. Then a series of events that forces the family to interact with the real world wakes Mortensen up to the fact that he may be doing some harm in raising his children in such a fashion.I liked that the movie acknowledges the hypocrisy that this particular family peddles in. For example, they celebrate Noam Chomsky day and honor him for what a great humanitarian he is and how good he was to his fellow man, but then they create a ruse involving Mortensen pretending to have a heart attack so that they can steal from a grocery store. This is surely o.k. in their eyes because, hey, the grocery store is part of ""the Man"" and only fat people with bad diets buy food from there -- forget that those same people showed real human kindness in coming to Mortensen's aid when they thought he was having a medical emergency. Another example -- Mortensen is proud of his children for knowing nothing about popular culture, yet has them reading books like ""Middlemarch"" and ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" which were, guess what, part of the popular culture when they were written. I guess he thinks nothing contemporary can be worth reading.The film ends in a place I could live with, with Mortensen's character recognizing that he needs to compromise, and that one need not abandon all of one's ideals because he's willing to participate in the culture around him. But before we get there, we go through the most awful series of plot developments that strain credibility beyond the breaking point.Like....the family digging up its freshly-buried mother so that they can honor her wishes to be cremated. I've been a pall bearer at more than one funeral, and caskets with dead bodies in them are HEAVY for six grown men to carry, yet this family consisting mostly of children manages to pull an entire coffin out of a six-foot grave with no equipment.Or....burning their mother's body on a bonfire while breaking into an impromptu musical number, and asking us to believe this would be a beautiful and natural moment for the family instead of the grisly nightmare that it would actually be in real life. This movie is all about one man not dealing with the reality of the world the way it is, and then the screenplay itself chooses to ignore the reality of how things would actually be just because it's more convenient and gives the director the scene he wants when he wants it. By the time the family was decorating their mother's corpse with flowers on the ride back to the wilderness (a corpse that looks beautiful, by the way), this film had lost me and I no longer cared how it ended.Movies about topics like the ones explored in ""Captain Fantastic"" should be made more often, but they need to be much better than this. Viggo Mortensen is receiving all sorts of praise for his performance. Maybe he was good, but who would be able to tell when the movie around him is so stupid?Grade: D"

It's the kind of movie in which you find yourself planning a re-watch during the first viewing. It's not that its plot is complicated, or hard to understand. It's that the little details glimpsed in the movie are intriguing and interesting.Viggo Mortensen plays a dad who has home-schooled his kids and raised them off the grid. They travel in an old bus and live in the wilderness where they learn all kinds of survival skills, as well as more academic stuff. The youngest kid is only about seven, and yet is shown to have superior knowledge of US politics than mainstream educated kids twice her age.The seemingly idyllic setting is challenged when Mortensen's wife has to be hospitalised for bipolar disorder and later takes her own life. The family wish to give her the Buddhist send-off she wanted, and butt heads with her father, played by Frank Langella, who thinks the kids should be raised in a mainstream institution.The movie is an intriguing, involving study of a family who lives entirely outside the norm, and it feels entirely believable."
" Hypocritical much?
",-0.4588,-0.8968,2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"A gentleman said it best in one of the reviews below: ""Personally ... I see no need to belittle and offend those who are (Christians). While projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview ... the film is actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values.""The acting is great, but this film is so hypocritical that it's difficult to see how anyone can take its message seriously.Underneath all its pretentious language, this is a story of an anti-Christian man who brainwashes his children to steal and be intolerant of others. If you want a well-written indie coming of age story instead of this propaganda-filled drivel, then watch The Way, Way Back."
" Captain Fantastic is FANTASTIC
",0.8374,0.9069,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"This film is outstanding. Viggo Mortenson delivers a powerhouse performance as a father determined to raise healthy, smart children who are free from the nonsense and BS typical of most Americans. He has chosen to live off the grid, and home-school his children. At the same time, he teaches them to be self-reliant. they know how to survive with only a knife. They all speak several foreign languages and can recite and discuss nearly any esoteric topic such as the relative merits of capitalism versus socialism. What becomes apparent, as they venture into the world at large on a mission to pay respects to the wife/mother of the family, is the fact that the children have no practical knowledge that is useful in American society. The thing I like most is this film seems to be a condemnation of that American society. It sheds an illuminating light on the materialism, greed, waste, anti=intellectualism and sheer ridiculousness that is the ""normal"" American Christian life. I would recommend this film for anyone who is interested in seeing how much better America could be if more of us rejected what has been fed to us as the ""proper"" way to live."
" A rare film that will make you laugh, cry, feel good and even think a little.
",0.5267,0.9931,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Some reviewers love it and a few hate it, but the 'love-its' have it by a country mile.As for this reviewer, well, yes I did enjoy it very much, but maybe the first hour a soupçon more than the second hour – but I'm splitting hairs.Are you tired of formulaic, franchise hi-tech rubbish that the Hollywood factories churn out these days?Do you sometimes wonder if there are any films being made anymore that can make you laugh, make you cry, make you wonder, make you think, and make you leave with a good feeling in your belly?If so, then Captain Fantastic may well be the movie for you.The story is quite simple. An American couple, Ben and Leslie, decide to uproot from so-called civilized America with their six kids and go and live in a cabin located deep in the mountains of Washington State. There's no electricity or water, no TV, no radio, no smartphones (or any phones) and none of the luxuries - and most might say necessities - of modern day living.The children are 'home schooled', are taught to hunt and forage for their food, and they live the life of backwoodsmen. They are obliged to follow a strict and sometimes dangerous fitness regime and are trained to deal with any emergency that may arise.They are all apparently happy with their lives in the wilderness, and their intelligent and well-educated parents imbue them with the precepts of socialism and teach them the evils of capitalism, corporate America, and the outside world.But Mum, (Leslie), has fallen ill. She has a serious mental disorder - paranoid and bipolar – a condition that has possibly been exacerbated by her chosen lifestyle. We don't see Leslie, except in very brief flashbacks, as when the film opens, she has already been shipped to a hospital where her estranged parents can watch over her.Soon after the movie starts, the family learn that Leslie has killed herself and the remainder of the film is devoted to the family's efforts to attend her funeral and what happens in its aftermath.Leslie's father, a very wealthy and influential man, blames Ben for the death of his daughter and warns him that if he tries to attend the funeral, he will have him arrested.At first, Ben accepts that he cannot go, but the six kids want to see their Mom one last time, so in the end, they load up their converted school bus and head back to civilization.The next part of the movie is really a road trip, and there some amusing incidents along the way. One with a cop who stops them for having a faulty tail light, and an embarrassing episode with the eldest son who has his first kiss with a strange girl, and in particular, a planned raid of a supermarket. Here they succeed in stealing hundreds of dollars worth of groceries under the noses of the shop owners.There follows a mix of both amusing and serious confrontations with the in-laws. Leslie's father succeeds in extricating the six kids from Ben's custody for a while, but it all works out pretty well in the end.The first part of the film was totally captivating in every possible way, but once they embark on their journey back to the real world, some of the plot holes were a little hard to stomach. In particular, the robbery of the food mart didn't sit well with this reviewer. Would a father who despised capitalism and wanted his kids to understand the true meaning of right and wrong embark on such a criminal venture?But apart from the moral issues of the robbery, what about the high risks of getting caught? If they were arrested it would be all over for family life in the mountains. Would he really take such a risk?Okay, I appreciate it was all done in a spirit of good humor, and it was genuinely funny – but at the expense of the good-natured and well- meaning citizens who become innocent dupes in their felonious act.One of the most amazing parts of the film was the kids. From the very start, I completely forgot that I was watching a team of child actors. For me, nearly all films containing child actors, no matter how good they are supposed to be, usually make me squirm a little when the 'little dears' say their lines. I am always painfully aware that the kids are actors acting parts.Yet never once throughout the whole movie did I once think to myself, ""Hey! these are just kids acting."" I was truly in their world from the very first frame of film to the last. All six kids were truly outstanding, and I was transported to their world. As indeed was Viggo Mortenson who played Ben, their father, to say nothing of the remaining ensemble cast. Not a dud between the lot of them. I particularly liked Frank Langella as the grieving, angry father.So apart from a couple of plot holes, (which only people like me are mean-spirited enough to take issue with), it is difficult to find fault with this very enjoyable film.The cinematography, screenplay, and direction were masterful and I hope we will see much more from the pen and undoubted directing talents of Matt Ross.We need more writers and directors like Matt Ross to bring us back to a time when filmmaking isn't just another rehash of yet another comic-book hero or a prequel, sequel, spin-off of Star Wars/Star Trek/West world/Frozen/ Finding Doryand God only knows what franchise."
" Funny, with some great social commentary and an even better Viggo Mortensen
",0.872,0.9991,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Sundance has offered us a lot in 2016. Manchester By the Sea gets a lot of Oscar buzz, Sing Street was simply terrific, and now Captain Fantastic hits it home with an extremely original, funny, beautiful drama, written and directed by Matt Ross. Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, the father of a big family with a disparate lifestyle. They live in a forest, hunt their own food, learn survival skills, are incredibly and surprisingly well educated, they are completely self-relient, independent from society. When one of Ben's daughters complains about being hungry, he hilariously replies with 'Then you should've shot the f*cking sheep!'. The mother of the family is sick and is staying at a hospital, which makes the task of Ben to keep the family together and strong more challenging than he might be able to handle.Viggo Mortensen continues to commit himself to great projects and is brilliant in the movie. His oldest son Bo is played by George MacKay and he delivers as well. Bo looks up to his dad and throughout the movie this leads to some enjoying scenes between the two of them. The family counts six kids and unfortunately, not all six of them were able to keep their head above water. Also, sometimes Matt Ross went a bit too far in showing how alternative these children are. We got it the first couple of times one of the children said something no kid would ever say, no need to rub It in. At times this made some of the children look robotic. The family bond however is depicted perfectly by both the actors and Matt Ross, leading to some funny and heartfelt moments. The movie touches on some of the Western values, which leads to some interesting views. Actually, I can't use the word 'interesting' according to the alternative family, so I'll expand more on this. The family lives in an extreme, far away from society. Extremes are never the right option, but they do offer some new perspective on values and norms that we have come to see as self-evident. Views on Christmas, money, education and brainless entertainment are some of these themes the movie touches upon. Ben's children are stronger and have a greater general knowledge compared to children raised in or by the society, so there are some arguments for his way of education. 'Captain Fantastic' works as a movie foremost because it doesn't try to make Ben's ways of doing things seem superior to the traditional ways. The children benefit in some aspects but also clearly suffer from this alternative education and lifestyle. This is shown in several scenes throughout the movie, when one kid hurts himself or another is freezing in the pouring rain. When the children's grandfather (a great Frank Langella) clearly shows his disapproval of Ben's methods, these particular scenes prevent him from being viewed as the villain. You can completely understand where the man is coming from.Another great aspect of the movie, which provides a lot of comedic relief, is the contrast between the family and the real world. Some of them have clearly never been far into this world. This leads to some shocking reactions about the countless number of fat people, a deliciously awkward dinner scene, a short, but very awkward romance and even criminal behavior. The entire second act is one big road trip, providing us with all these funny sequences. The soundtrack is great and somehow you want to be part of this family, but on the other hand not. Apart from one cheesy scene that didn't work but luckily didn't ruin the ending, the third act delivered the same enjoyment as the second act. But only in a more heartfelt way.Captain Fantastic is a well-made, good looking movie with some great performances. The balance between the funny and emotional moments is perfect, making it a light movie, easy and fun to watch."
" Real Human in their Natural Habitat
",0.3612,-0.4874,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie on New Year weekend and was totally mesmerized by its conceptual beauty. This movie has an epic beginning which starts from a family living off in total wilderness on their own. They start off from hunting game for food, kids learning how to defend themselves in knife fight, Rock Climbing as a physical activity and all the jungle survival stuff. One of the thing which kept me mesmerized throughout this movie was the complete education which the dad was providing these kids, he was teaching them how to hunt, how to rock climb and then at the end of day he is teaching his kids on topics ranging from Quantum Entanglement to Literature and at last when all the daily chores are over they gather for a music session which start off from the dad bringing his guitar and strumming some classical notes to every kid bringing their instruments one by one finally converging to a soulful family music session. All the members of the family no matter how small in age have complete freedom to have their own opinions and thoughts as long as they can explain their perspective. It was beautiful to watch 8 year old kids explaining away recently passed US government bills and having their own point of view on its ramifications on economy .This guys philosophy on kids is to not feed them the usual bullshit but instead making them familiar with the plain truth whether it is about drugs , sex , death or mental illness. This guy does not want to keep his kids in a wonderland through misinformation. This movie makes you question the reality of things around you, especially the schools and colleges and showcases the importance of all round development of an individual as a human being which makes them ready to face the real world . I felt like one of the major cause of dysfunction in all of us stems from the detachment that all of us have from the reality since childhood because of over- protective parent or the general view of people to make kids focus more on fairy tales instead of real things . I mean why can't we treat them like grownups and answer their curiosity with the raw truth. That is why when most of us grow old and see the real world around we feel mostly confused, helpless and unable to cope up with the reality of things. This movie shook some of my internal concept from the ground up and made me re-think on my views on how we should live and what constitutes good parenting. This is gonna be a classic , must watch some years from now!"
" A satirical, Utopian mind experiment about how to raise kids in our consumerist world
",0.0,0.9968,2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Captain Fantastic is a great and thought provoking movie, especially for parents of today (a group I happen to be a part of). From their first day, kids of today are effected by mass media and consumerist behaviour in a way, we couldn't have imagined only 20 years back. Overprotective parents keep children away from making their own experiences and interacting with nature and their environment. Strangely enough, most parents romanticize their own childhood, when ""we just played outside for hours with nobody looking after us"". So wouldn't it be great to withdraw from the capitalistic society, the industrial food and the self-destructing 24/7-worklife? Can we not just return to a naturalistic, rural way of life in line with the nature around us, in which we just aim for knowledge and self-fulfillment? Well, can we?Captain Fantastic seeks for answers to these questions. It does so by conducting a mind-experiment. What, if a family just did that? Return to the wilderness, live in the woods with and from the things, nature has to offer, while teaching your kids everything about humanism, literature and philosophy. And how would that work out, if they are forced to return into ""the real world"" with all its shopping-malls, video games and fast food? Of course, this clash of cultures makes for some very funny and comedic moments, giving this movie a very satirical edge. When Viggo Mortensen's character, the hippie-father Ben, visits his sister and her family with his six children, he basically sits for dinner with all of us, showing us the mirror image of our very own family life. Very often, the movie stretches the credibility of it's own convictions. We only see them living in the woods during summer, for example and I wondered, how their life would be during a harsh winter. But I don't think, we as viewers should make the reality- check here. It is a Utopian world, the family lives in, that is supposed to contrast the ""modern world"". I will say one thing, though: I have no doubt, that kids are absolutely capable of the things, we see them doing in this movie, like hunting and dissecting wild animals properly, dealing responsible with knives and open fire, understanding complex political and philosophical concepts at a very young age and so on. That is probably the most important message of this movie: Our kids are all smart. What they make of their abilities, just depends on the environment, we create around them. So, there is an important discussion going on in this movie. Thankfully, this is supported by some great acting, especially from Viggo Mortensen and Frank Langella. But also the child actors do a very good job. This movie has a 12-certificate in most countries, most likely for a scene, in which we see Viggo Mortensen in all his glory, and some very open talks about ""sexual intercourse"". But in the spirit of the movie, I would say, that it is absolutely fine to see this with younger viewers, too. I'm pretty sure, it will make for some interesting family discussions at diner table :)"
" Evaluating Alternatives
",0.0,0.8908,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Almost all discussions of this film center around two themes: criticism of the mainstream American/Western culture and raising children. But I think the strongest aspect of Captain Fantastic is its critical exploration of alternative systems.We all know the inconsistencies and the ironic hypocrisies of the mainstream culture. But no system is actually inherently coherent. While Ben appraises the norm of critical discussion during the part where the little kid opposes to the Chomsky day, Ben himself dismisses critical discussion and attempts to forcefully take the child from his grandparents. While we see that the little girl knows more about the Bill of Rights than two 13 years old boys, we also see that the oldest sibling is completely ignorant and clumsy when he chats up with Claire. While we see them very violently hunt animals, they are shocked with the brutality of video games.Now, the mainstream approach of the alternative system acknowledges these facts, and argues that the skills of our protagonists are more important than the skills of the American masses. This line of thinking can also be seen in various kinds of elitisms such as scientism, rationalism, eliminative physicalism, etc. But according to what standards exactly are they more important? How did the dichotomies between natural/unnatural, actual/non-actual food, real/unreal, etc. come about? This is where armchair intellectualism comes to a stop. These standards of determining what's important and what's not originates not by reference to some prior starting point that prepares the ground of discussion. There is first starting point, first standards, fundamentals of any kind, because they too would be in need of justification by reference to some prior standards.What gives rise to these standards at the first place is simply the way we live and the way we conceive of the world. These cannot be criticized through intellectual discussion, but they can only change through active participation in the world. This is what the film confirms. Before the girl fell down the roof and almost died, there was no intellectual discussion that could have changed Ben's beliefs. Not because Ben was bigoted the same way every other person is bigoted too, but because some things are inescapably accepted by him to make way for further beliefs.To sum up, Captain Fantastic shows the imperfect, fallible nature of human beings. It shows that derailing from the mainstream culture is not an answer to our problems, but that if there's any answer, it could be known not through blind intellectualism, but through actively exploring the alternatives.PS: the dialogue about Trotsky, Stalin and Mao also points to this issue."
" We Are Family
",0.0,0.9929,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.The roles between parent and child can be difficult and demanding yet ultimately rewarding. Writer / Director Matt Ross masterfully shows the dysfunctional dynamics of the family unit in his engrossing drama, Captain Fantastic, a drama which boasts a truly fantastic performance by Viggo Mortensen as the title character.￼Mr. Mortensen plays Ben Cash, a survivalist father and New Age philosopher who takes his tough love to dramatic extremes in raising his sextet of impressionable children. Their world is all inclusive, free of technology, one with the natural environment sans the capitalistic or pop culture trappings. Home schooled, his family's average itinerary includes hunting for their own food, practicing self defense techniques with real weapons, reading up on all the literary classics and doing a dissertation on any heady topic. They can spout Nietzsche or their patron saint, Noah Chomsky. on request. As their father, Jack treats his brood as young soldiers equipped to handle any emergency...until one does come along and threatens to destroy his happy family.The film is disturbing, in its words and pictures, and presents a questionable viewpoint about this patriarch and the strict regime he inflicts upon his children. Rightfully so, Jack's parenting skills comes into question and Mr. Mortensen is not afraid to show the vulnerable and ugly side to his character. His ends do not always justify his means. It is a daring unsentimental tour-de-force performance and Mr. Mortensen takes this unlikable gruff man whose passions often clouds his reason and makes him human.￼The young actors playing his tribe are wonderful and create a nice chemistry together. They deserve mention as they give the film its pathos: Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks, Charlie Shotwell, and especially George MacKay as Bodevan, the eldest child who begins to doubt his his father and his existence from the real world. Adding strong turns in other supporting parts are Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn, Frank Langella and Anne Dowd as Jack's concerned in-laws. (There is a particularly telling scene comparing the intellectual Cash misfits and today's typical teenage generation that reflects the societal contrasts extremely well.)Captain Fantastic is a thought-provoking film about family. Sometimes the screenplay glosses over some logical gaps that never really add up such as the lack of financial hardship that seems to elude them or the confused sexual education of the adolescents in this clan. Some plot devices seem unexplained and a tad far-fetched like the sketchy details of the family's final mission or the sudden forgiving nature of the children toward their father.￼All in all, Captain Fantastic is a remarkable film, filled with an insightful look at the unique diversity found in our children and the undeniable power that parents can have over their loved ones. Careful the things you do, children will listen. GRADE: B+NOTE: There is a very graphic opening scene that is not for the faint of heart. so be forewarned."
" A movie that pretends to do the opposite of what it does
",-0.1027,0.8797,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Captain Fantastic is a beautifully filmed, moving story. But as much as I enjoyed watching it, it left a bad aftertaste. It pretends sympathy for the lifestyle choices of the main character, who brings up his children in the wild, teaching them both survival skills and a critical attitude towards capitalist, consumerist America. However, in the confrontation with this modern and consumerist society, he is in the end forced to admit that it was all a bit of a mistake, and that it was not in the interest of his children to educate them like that. Wherever your ideological sympathies may lie, this film manipulates the viewer badly. The Cash family, in the end, are some kind of caricature in their extremism. So the movie ends up trying to convince the viewer that turning one's back on this society, even though it is far from flawless, is a very bad idea. And this, after having first pretended great sympathy with the Cash family's lifestyle. What makes all of this worse is that it's very easy to take the film at first degree, and only see its insincere criticism of consumerist society. ""A film that really makes you think"", people will coo, without paying much attention to the fact that in the end all this reflection is rejected, thus making it easy for the viewer not to be challenged in their ideas at all. Additionally, what makes it a story badly told is that we do not really get to know the mother at all, apart from her last wishes, and the suggestion that the choice for the wilderness was made in the hope that it would help her recover her mental health. Why, crucially, did she at some point believe that her parents should ""rescue"" her from the wilderness (and her husband), why did she change her mind, and most importantly why was it decided that she ought to be hospitalised? How can this be a story about choices that parents have to confront if the mother's perspective is missing? See this film if you must: it does have beautiful scenery, beautiful and convincing actors, and very comical moments. But prepare to feel manipulated."
" ""Father Knows Best"" for the aging Hippie Generation
",0.6369,-0.2531,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"If you're in the mood for some hippie porn, this is the movie for you. (Unavoidable spoilers to follow.) Hunky Viggo Mortensen plays another superhero, this time the uber-sensitive dad raising his six kids (ages ranging from about 8 to 18 years old) out in the woods in a blissful natural state. Not only does he home school them into reading the classics (Dostoevsky), books on Quantum physics and string theory (even quizzing them), but they jam on guitars around the campfire. But wait, there's more! Superdad is also so awesome, he's a master of the wild, teaching the kids to camouflage themselves and move so quietly they can take down a full grown deer with just a knife, before they go home to discuss ""Power to the people"" and ""Stick it to the man"" (no exaggeration, a trite term used twice in the movie).There is some alleged drama, when bipolar mom commits suicide and her strait-laced parents don't want Superdad at the funeral. Then there follows that most-beloved Indie-film trope, ""the road trip"" because Hippie Father Knows Best, the desires of other people be damned. Of course, there's no explanation about how he learned to speak six languages, be the forest-master, and know about music and string theory? Nope, no need to explain it, because in Hippie Porn, just being against the Man and the System is enough. No logical story required and you certainly won't find one here."
