" Has its moments but far too few
",0.0,0.7924,2021-04-11 00:00:00,4,Great cast a great (truly) great writer but it fails to make the mark. It sort of has the feeling of a student project. If it was that it would be sensational. But it's not - Shame really ðŸ¤—
" Enjoyable but only if you haven't read the book!
",0.3054,-0.7482,2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Knowing nothing about the movie or the book I watched this film and even though the beginning and middle were enjoyable the ending was weak as hell! Which was a shame as it was enjoyable up to then!However I haven't read the book, if had read the book it probably would infuriated me as much as the rest of the people that clearly did read the book and were therefore infuriated!Saying that I didn't read the book and found the film somewhat enjoyable until the last third!"
" Not as bad as they say.
",0.431,0.9642,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"I find it amusing reading the reviews that a lot of 1 stars are from people complaining its not like the book, well the guy that wrote the book is credited for the screenplay so presumably had some input. Secondly this isn't the book it's the movie and cannot flesh out characters and story like a book can. I enjoyed the film people have complained about the cgi but I didn't see too much wrong, I liked the sound work although it seemed to rip off Ju-On a bit it was creepy enough to work and I found the ending an interesting twist as can often be the case with Kings work. It could have been better I'm sure if the runtime was extended an extra half hour but studio's don't like to gamble on movies 2 hours plus. Cussack was good as always and Jackson played his part well. Worth a watch in my opinion."
" Not as bad as the haters say
",-0.09,0.9729,2021-03-26 00:00:00,6,"Okay I get it if you've read the book and this movie is a disappointing reflection of that, but it's not that bad at all. Samuel LJ is pretty good as always. John C is starting to look a bit odd. Too much face surgery me thinks, but he plays a good part all the same. It's a good twist on the zombie movie genre and really not that bad."
" Wow. This is really terrible.
",0.1045,0.9941,2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"I had low expectations. And still 'Cell' fell below them. I try to avoid 1-star ratings because they feel so very unfair, but this deserves it.It's been a very long time since I've read the Stephen King novel, and I recall to a certainty only bits and pieces. Some things got lost in adaptation; the movie adds or changes some things, too. None of this matters, because King's own screenplay, co-written with Adam Alleca, dispenses with all subtlety.From the moment the opening credits begin we question what we're watching - every name flashes on screen as white text in a big, opaque, black box. Sure, at this point the visuals are just exposition, shots of people on cell phones, but immediately we question the film-making prowess of those involved.In the middle of trying to call his son and estranged wife, John Cusack's character loses battery life on his cell phone just in time to watch a mysterious signal apparently alter the brain of everyone who uses theirs.From there 'Cell' mostly becomes a blase zombie movie, with the chief difference being that these zombies are slightly less noticeably monstrous in appearance than those in the average horror flick. Most of the dialogue is altogether pointless; it matters only in instances when characters speculate on the events they're witnessing. Those sparse scenes when characters get a brief moment to relax are embarrassing to behold. We get intermittent shots of characters walking through the wasteland of what used to be civilization, as though no other movie has done this. Action-packed moments of zombies charging are edited in such a way to suggest inhuman speed. How very exciting.Usually when an actor with a recognizable name appears in something as bad as this, we readily make jokes about rescinding past awards, or refer to such titles as ""paycheck movies."" John Cusack has a very long list of credits to his name. Samuel L. Jackson certainly does, too, to say nothing of Stacy Keach, who is lucky enough to get his payday after only a very brief cameo. What are they all doing here? When I first started watching I thought to myself, ""You know what? They're at a point in their careers when they can do literally anything they want. Good for them."" But now that I've seen 'Cell,' I don't think I have the will to be so generous. Even when characters aren't drinking in a brief quiet moment, the cast so half-heartedly spit out such pointless lines of mundane triviality that we have to question if they agreed to appear in this movie only if they could be on set face-down drunk.Personally I feel like Isabelle Fuhrman puts in the best performance of the film, which makes me feel bad that she somehow got wrangled into this. Yet of what I recall of King's novel, by comparison she is given much less to work with in her character here. She deserves much better.I was able to maintain suspension of disbelief well enough when I read the book long ago, but seeing the plot play out on screen is an entirely different matter. The most basic idea underpinning the narrative is one thing; every notion added on top of it as the film progresses strains credulity ever further. I'm reminded of the 1999 TV movie 'Fatal error,' about a computer virus that evolves to transmit to humans.When at last the climax rolls around as unconvincingly as possible, with Cusack's character abruptly departing on his own, we're treated to a scene at once wholly unbelievable yet also so unexciting as to utterly drain 'Cell' of its own juice. This is the only part of the film that really feels like a King story, as our protagonist beholds an otherworldly vision and a veritable monolith. I don't mind that the ending, like other details, was changed from the book; I do mind that it falls so flat that even if the rest of the movie were worth watching (it's not), its conclusion would render it inert.As ever, I try to remember that no one sets out to make a bad movie; maybe if I don't like something, I'm just not in the target audience. But on the other hand: If the omission of nuance in the screenplay seemed incidental at the start, we're forced to reconsider that belief during the scene in which Cusack and Jackson drive a massive diesel truck over a football field full of ""recharging"" ""phoner"" zombies, spraying them with petrol, while Mr. Trololo himself, Eduard Khil, sings his Internet-famous version of ""I am very glad, as I'm finally returning home."" Maybe the filmmakers really did set out to make a bad movie. Maybe 'Cell' is one big joke, and this scene is to impart to audiences that we're the target. I'm not sure any more.Outside of Fuhrman, the most redeeming part of the movie is the fluffy white cat that briefly appears on screen early on. After the beginning scenes of the film, its purrs offer a brief respite that in hindsight were probably supposed to prime viewers for the mindless onslaught we endure for the next hour. Good try, kitty.'Cell' certainly isn't the first story to play with the notion of an electronic signal fundamentally changing people, but if this were to in any way represent the standard, we could only hope it is the last. I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie, neither as a King adaptation nor on its own merits. Watch it if you're curious. But don't say I didn't warn you."

",0.0,0.6541,2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Is this film the greatest ever made?
No.
Does it deserve to be lambasted the way it has been?
Absolutely not!As somebody who has both read the book and watched the movie, I found the film to be highly entertaining. The most disappointing aspect to the film in my opinion, was the over acting of the infected (as seems to be the case in a lot of the lower budget movies of this genre). The main characters were both interesting and believable. I've read a review on here of how somebody deemed the movie the worst interpretation of a book ever filmed, and then complained that movie had a harrowing ending, but if anything, unlike a lot of movies, the movie stays true to the book right to the end. I would recommend watching this with an open mind, without carrying any negative criticism aimed towards it from reviews on here, and making your own mind up."

" A Fair Adaption of the Novel Cell
",0.5574,0.8858,2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Having read the book Cell, this movie is a pretty true to reality adaptation of the novel, even down to the ending, which is almost as disappointing as the end of the novel was for me. On the whole a good watch, however. Does not deserve such a low rating whatsoever."

" I forgot, which ""escape from the mindless, murderous hordes"" movie is this?
",-0.7506,0.6523,2021-01-31 00:00:00,3,"What do you get when you take three former B+ list actors (one only in a cameo role) and have them perform in front of the camera for a director who last directed a film about six years ago? You get ""Cell."" (I think this film torpedoed the director's career.) I have to classify this as a B movie, only because of its complete lack of originality. If it had bad acting (instead of the no acting it has in it), bad special effects and bad costumes like the B movies of yore, then this would be a C movie simply because it's not even as creative as an old B movie. At least those old-timers tried to come up with something new. The folks that worked on this didn't seem to try. Seriously, there's nothing original enough in this to make it worth watching.I'm giving this film three barely-deserved stars simply because it's technically acceptable - the cinematography, sound and all that are fine. The story not so much.This is one of those films you can watch for the first 10 minutes and the last five minutes and get pretty much everything you need. I wish I'd done that, as I'm behind on trimming my nose hairs. (Yes, it takes at least an hour; I need new string for the weed whacker.) I had an almost overwhelming urge to check my phone throughout the movie, but given the plot I figured it would be a good idea for me to do that. I had to find some other way to occupy myself as the movie played, because the movie wasn't using up more than maybe 3.2% of my brain.This is a move as original as all the other mindless, murderous hordes movies. This even includes scary, inhuman mouth agape screams from the not-zombies. (They're alive, unlike zombies, but they might as well be dead.)To give you an idea of how... silly, I guess... this was, one of the songs heard that sort of lulled the non-zombies into a state of stupid non-zombie-ness was the ""Trololo Song."" You know the one - the freaky Russian guy singing/laughing his way through a song on some cheap Russian TV set. Yeah, they used that song. (My guess: it was free to use. More money to be spent on ""hookers and blow"" for the wrap party.)Here's a great (as in, stupid) quote for you (the only one I remember): ""Open up, we're Americans."" Understandably that's something they'd need to clarify BECAUSE THEY'RE FRICKIN' IN AMERICA. It's like knocking on a door and in your deepest, most masculine voice you say ""Open up, I'm a man."" Gimme' a break.An ice cream truck is part of the story. Seeing the characters drive around in it I was really hoping for jolly music or bells and a horde of non-zombie kids running after it, all wanting cold treats. You can't go on a mindless murderous rampage on an empty stomach. (I also don't recommend watching this movie on an empty stomach. They say to eat bananas if you think you'll barf because they taste the same coming up as they did going down. You're welcome.)Another quote: ""Ray, what's the around your neck?"" I already knew. That question alone answered itself as long as you keep up on weird news. 'Nuff said.There's ONE reason and one reason only to watch this movie. You will see a very, very minor character, the one with the Electrolarynx electronic voice box (what a strange, pointless thing to include in a film) that I SWEAR is proof that WALTER MATTHAU AND BILL MURRAY HAD A LOVE CHILD. I'm absolutely serious here. At first I thought, ""Wow, a Bill Murray cameo."" Then I thought, ""No, not Bill Murray, but wow, that looks kinda' like Walter Matthau, although I know he's dead."" Then I realized ""It's Bill Murray AND Walter Matthau - the offspring of an unholy union between two great performers.And now I come to the end of my review. So, dear readers, do you want to know what exactly caused cell phones to emit dangerous signals that turned ordinary distracted zombie-like people into non-zombies? THE THING THAT CAUSED ALL THE MAYHEM WAS...And now you know just as much as I and all the other victims of this film know."

Jackson and Jo+hn Cusack film within the Stephen King movie adaptations, but it resulted in a messy, non satifying and really lazy horror.

" A Drunk Dial ?
",-0.34,-0.9841,2020-12-23 00:00:00,3,"I knew going in this wasn't going to be good. A relatively recent film, with recognisable movie stars and it didn't make it to the cinema obviously means that even the producers lost faith in it at some point - and rightly so, whilst it's not the worst film I've ever seen, it is a bit of a mess.A pulse of static, sent to every cellular phone in the world transformers anyone who heard it into a violent, rage fuelled monster. Author Clay Riddell (John Cusack) teams with Tom McCourt (Samuel L Jackson) and his young neighbour Alice (Isabelle Fuhrman) to travel across this apocalyptic landscape to find his wife and child. As they travel, they learn more about the continuing mutations that are affecting the infected humans, and each have nightmares involving the same man in a red hood.Poor John Cusack. The 2010's really hit him with a whole decade of garbage to power through. Hopefully the 2020's can restore him a bit in people's eyes. He's fine in this, but it's hard not to guess that he could see this one going wrong early on. It just doesn't have the budget to convincingly do what it aims for. It does manage the occasional moment of creepiness, mostly involving the mouths of the infected and the noises generated by them. One scene, in a bar around the halfway point gives a good scare - mostly though, it's just a generic ""fast zombie"" film. The devastation of the apocalypse is limited to rubbish on a few streets and some quiet fields and the plane crash at the start and explosion at the end are very badly rendered.The ending is the worst bit though. I appreciate that apparently the readers didn't enjoy the books ending, and it was reworked, but this is just a nothing ending. No even hinted at explanation of what's going on, no explanation of who the hooded man is, or what he wants. Just an ending that doesn't make sense, followed by a twist that pointlessly undoes it and some audio from The Kop.I've never read the book, so am not a disgruntled fan, but rarely have I seen a film that was such as mess of half thought ideas and bad choices."
" Good feel and atmosphere and great cast
",0.7906,-0.8484,2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"This movie has a nice atmosphere. I usually do not like zombie movies but this and 28 Days Later managed to balance the post-apocalyptic theme with an intriguing vibe from the story. One was based in the empty streets of London, and the other in the beautiful New England countryside. They managed to focus on the family/personal aspect, with a little bit of sci-fi suspense, more than the dull struggle against mindless creatures. They also both have a stellar cast.Some people like Joshua Kyte (who by the way only has this one review meaning it is probably a bot) are reviewing the movie based on the book. This is a logical fallacy and a wrong thing to do. You cannot compare a movie to the original source material - some are better, some are worse. No one should go on bookstore websites to review a book based on the movie it inspired! This is pointless rubbish."
" Very good
",0.4927,-0.9794,2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,"Not good like a book, but it's ok. Everyone knows how hard is to make a movie exactly like a book, so because of that the movie is good for me. Low rating is because of the song 'You'll never walk alone'. Good movie with so bad song... Bad. I would give a lower razing, but i can't because of Samuel."

" Another King Adapted Screenplay Miss
",-0.1531,0.8434,2020-11-16 00:00:00,4,"For such a popular author it's quite amazing how often his books misfire when adapted to the screen. For every ""It"" there are 5 or 6 of these the Movie folks think they are improving on the source material. Now King is listed a few times in the Credits so has to take some blame. ""Cell"" was a ""The Stand"" type novel and had its critics and I suppose readers form their own mental pictures. This one doesn't flow well and seems to be meant as a zombie flick with a twist."
" One hell of a film!
",-0.7088,0.867,2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,Just when I thought that the world was all zombied out this picture puts a new take on it. It was good. Couldnt believe it was a King novel! Then again I didnt think that Shawshank was either. Most of the movies from King novels and short stories are great. Cant say that for the novels themselves. They are way too painfull and overbearing to read. I've seen this film several times and I'm never disappointed. Good acting all around.
" Worst portrayal of a fantastic book since The Langoliers.
",-0.128,0.312,2020-10-17 00:00:00,1,"First of all, John Cusack and Samuel Jackson should be ashamed of themselves for even appearing in this movie. It started off okay, stuck to the book and had some pretty good effects and acting. However, after the phones take over peoples minds it goes downhill from there. They crammed 3/4ths of the entire book into the first 20 min of the movie. I understand that you have a time frame difference between books and movies but that was just ridiculous. The movie leaves out extremely important scenes and there is even a part (trying not to give spoilers here) where they are at one place and in the next scene they're somewhere else entirely with no explanation of how they got there. The only way you could possibly know how they end up where they are at the end is if you read the book. If you didn't read the book you won't have a clue why they are where they are and it won't make sense. Id give it negative stars if I could. Just read the book. Its beautiful, amazing and well written. The movie is a dumpster fire."

The acting isn't great nor horrible, but the plot is mediocre and corny.I didn't like the premise of the film, but I went along with it, I thought I would give it a chance. People go crazy when they receive a phone call because aliens are messing up phone calls. Yeah this is basically the plot, I'm not joking.I decided I would give it a try because of the two main actors, Samuel Jackson and John Cusack, but the script was honestly awful. The plot isn't interesting, there are no scenes that catch your interest fully and by the end you're just bored. The worst part is the ending. It's pointless and makes the entire film pointless. Therefore, when you get to it, the only emotion you have is anger for having wasted your time in a pointless film. It's not even funnily bad, it's just bad."

So after my first encounter I read a few reviews on here and decided to buy the novel as lots of folk were recommending it over the film. Anyway, the book is bonkers and not one of Kings finest, let's just leave it at that. Once the book had been finished, tried the film again and I managed to limp to the finish line and what a waste of time that was.

Well this is a very dull movie, with dull performances by everyone, even Cusack and Samuel Jackson, two really great actors. The story is uninteresting and generic with no real suspense or horror and to be perfectly honest a think the zombies or phoners or whatever it is they're called look really goofy with their mouths open. There's no explanation for what happens wich doesn't make the film worse but it sure makes it more disapointing at the end, at least for me.
I have yet to read the novel so I don't know if it's much better than the adaptation or equally bad but either way it doesn't change the fact that Cell is a pretty dreadfull film.

" Technically incompetent
",-0.4767,-0.8882,2020-07-25 00:00:00,4,"This review contains spoilers.Cell is directed by Tod Williams from the Paranormal Activity movie series. It stars John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Isabelle Fuhrman as apocalypse survivors. A mysterious signal hits every cellular device causing its victims to devolve to their base instincts. This causes modern society to crumble as much of the population is connected at the time of the event known as The Pulse. Clay Riddell, played by John Cusack, is one of the survivors of the event and he embarks on a journey to find his loved ones. Alice, an upstairs neighbor, and Tom, a subway driver join him in his trek.Cell has numerous problems as a movie. The immediate problem with the movie is its technical incompetence. The movie has poor CGI effects and some of the most jarring editing. The scene transitions are accompanied by the strange music choices. One of these bizarre technical choice s is at the introduction of the movie with large black bars with text that block up most of the screen to introduce credits. The movie cuts in ways that do not make sense. After The Pulse is triggered, Clay is chased by phoners. One of them tackles Clay and then the movie transitions to Clay getting up easily with the phoner nowhere to be found. The effects in general are also fake looking and whenever gore is shown, it is incredibly obvious that it is an effect. The violence in the movie is also tame. Another strange moment is when Clay is driving into Kashak and the movie plays intense music and cuts to ducks in a pond.The antagonistic phoners in this movie are a source of unintentional comedy. From the beginning with the airport sequence, the strange behavior of the phoners can be seen. The audience can see some of them dangcing while others attack the normies. The movie cuts to a clip of a phoner foaming on a toilet. When the phoners chase Alice, Clay, and Tom through a forest one of them only has a tennis racquet and underwear. One of the phoners even runs into a tree despite the movie establishing that they have created a hive mind. Another scene has a large group of phoners pack themselves into a football field to switch off. The group then plays the viral video song, Trololo, as they sleep. In many moments, the phoners have a white noise effect in their speech which adds to the unintentional hilarity. These are noth the only scenes that rae strange and to see more, one can watch the movie.The plot of the movie is inconsistent. The movie hints at the Raggedy Man's influence on the group and remaining humans. At the end, it appears it was all a construct of Clay Riddell's mind. The movie constantly pulls the audience in these circles, but ultimately comes back to Clay's story. The Raggedy man and his flock of phoners are some of the best unintentional comedy I have seen. The phoners typically run around in circle when they are idling. They also communicate through digital warble that simply has to be experienced.The main cast is horribly misused. John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are great in 1408 but in this movie they are ineffective. Likewise Isabelle Fuhrman is not used well here. The actors do not have any stand out moments. All of their dialogue is generally bland. None of this is the cast's fault as I believe they had executed the script to the best of their ability. The main faults that caused the disaster are the poor writing, directing, and editing. The choices in this movie are baffling.Cell is a terrible movie. Unless you are interested in an unintentionally funny movie, I do not recommend viewing it.Grade: F"

Cusack feels like he is totally phoning his performance in (excuse the pun) and even Sam Jackson can't save this absolute horror show of a script.Oh my god. What did they do to the raggidy man.

Then a mysterious crashing sound causes everyone using cell phone to turn into zombie like creatures and attack each other.Cusack escapes, attempts to find his family, and we see his journey through what has quickly turned into a post apocalyptic world. Unfortunately, we never understand how or why cell towers turn ordinary people into zombies, or why he and normal people around him keep dreaming about a scary character wearing a red hoodie, who seems to be the leader of the zombie race.The movie never gets any better, and really is a waste of time."

",-0.6249,-0.9943,2020-05-12 00:00:00,4,"A poor adaptation of Stephen King's apocalyptic bestseller, 'Cell' is often dumb, rushed, and dull.When a mysterious cellphone signal begins turning phone users into savage killers, graphic novelist Clay Riddell (John Cusack) joins a few survivors (including Samuel L. Jackson) as he strives to locate his estranged wife and son.Whereas the book was smart and scary, this horror film is anything but. Inexplicably, King helps sabotage his own adaptation with a script that fails to create decent characters, with no chemistry amongst the leads. It doesn't help that it's poorly acted, with a capable cast doing little to make you believe they're struggling in a frightening new landscape of death and desolation.The creepy ideas surrounding technology in the novel are lost on their way to the big screen, with very little making sense; and the 'zombified' humans look, act, and sound silly more than fearsome. Overall, bad camera work, messy plotting, and an absence of suspense make this King adaptation dead on arrival.4/10"

I'm not a big King fan in general but this was a mixed up mess, half boring zombie movie half m night shamalan ""something is happening... doesn't really matter why or how"" movie.**SPOILERS**The plot is that something for some reason magically turned cell phone users into... zombies? But zombies who apparently sleep, and aren't really that interested in doing anything zombie related. These zombies like music... (yes im not joking) and walking around in circles endlessly.John Cusak plays the same emotionless character he has been playing since the 90's. He apparently writes comic books, and I think that was supposed to be important, but the plot was so poorly executed with such bad writing that it never really ties in. He randomly meets some ppl wearing red hoodies which is a character he drew? But who cares because its a jumbled mess.Along the way from boring to who cares, he meets a selection of disposable characters that aren't developed at all and usually die the same scene they are introduced in.He wanders around America looking for his family even though they are obviously dead.Samuel Jackson randomly mentions his character was in the military a few times, that's about as far as he's developed.The attractive neighbour apparently hated the wife character (who only has a line and then is dead anyway), but again, like everything else all the motivation is just offhandedly mentioned, not developed and very boring.Avoid this mess, if you want to see a good movie with Sam Jackson about cell phones being used to take over the world watch the Kingsmen"

I started watching and had high hopes early. Cussack and SLJ are great in their roles. But so many key events from the book that define the later events and decisions are omitted. And then I find these defining moments themselves are omitted.The resultant mish-mash is an OK stand alone thriller using the Stephen King title and concept but quickly lose the direction of the journey that the novel is taking you on.
If was not a SK fan of 50 years standing I may be tempted to rate it higher. And if I did not enjoy the book so much, well again. But the book is so good and so chilling...
They could not even be true to the ending. Sorry but if I had not already been lost then the ending lost me totally. It completely loses any touch with the message the book is trying to convey.

There's the real movie, a better-than-average zombie flick with a cast of respectable actors giving their best, a series of very well written plot points (the initial attack, how the girl joins the group, the whole private school segment) and a story original enough to keep me interested for 80 minutes.
And then there's... whatever that end was. No more interaction among the actors, a painfully visible green screen room, no dialogues, bad lighting, rushed ""action"": basically a 10-minute long unskippable cutscene from an old videogame, that completely and utterly demolished all the tension built until that point.
I want to make it clear that I didn't dislike the ending as a narrative resolution: to me, the fate of John Cusack's character makes perfect sense and I even liked that. What I hated was how it was brought on screen. It's like they ran out of money with 10 minutes left in the movie and they had to come up with a new ending on the spot."

",0.0,-0.296,2019-07-28 00:00:00,1,Just spent an hour and 38 minutes watching this and I have no idea how it ended the final minutes show 2 different things
" It might frighten the spiders in your bathroom
",-0.34,0.9832,2019-07-24 00:00:00,7,"A small film in many ways, well built, but in no way outstanding. This is a film for teenagers (over 15, or under if in the privacy of your home if your parents agree, or at least agreed before leaving for New York City for the day) who like to be afraid by meeting on the screen the people you would never meet in the street or they would systematically avoid on the street, or in high school as for that, teachers, principals, students or guidance counselors.The idea in 2006 when the book was written, and even in 2014 when the film was shot was still in a way simple and virginal since we had not yet seen how social networks could be manipulated and could manipulate the people so well into getting the result they would like to get in an election, presidential or referendum. With this simple tools of millions, billions of cell phones always on anyway, someone who could access a dispatch center or processing tower or center, could easily send a message on all cell phones in the world and people could be 99,99% guided into doing exactly what would be funny for the manipulator. Violence for example, but that is only one example, an easy example.I think Stephen King has done a lot better with Mr. Mercedes, a trilogy, because then the manipulation is between one deranged person who has technical reach and knowhow on one hand, and particular victims chosen as being susceptible to enter a game on a console, and that game is hypnotizing, and the console is a tool to bring people down into obedience. When we are dealing with individual actions it is a lot more interesting. But when you are dealing with a mass phenomenon it is just frightening, gross, or whatever but it has little poignancy.King manages to give some depth to the story by centering on one man, a graphic artist, who tries to reach his wife and his son. He sure finds them, but the wife is one of them, one of the rabid crazy lunatics that are obeying their cell phones, and he manages to find his son just at the right time, when he is, the son, on the point of passing over to the other side. But our graphic artist had managed along the way with a few immune people (immune is the proper word because cell phones are a disease) to gather a truck full of plastic that was supposed to be blown up at the end of the line, and sure enough you always reach the end of the line, and you instantly know when you are there, and then one call on a cell phone and the plastic goes up into flames and smoke.The film is thus slightly too general and fuzzy about details and individuals to really reach the level of angst that could give the story some deep signification. Just enough for a summer night if you do not have anything more interesting, I mean interesting, to do. You will follow the plot without any problem, even if you do not- follow the dialogue which is blurred by cheap production. That kind of blurred dialogue is supposed to be realistic and you listen to the sound tack as if you were listening to a person with a hoarse throat trying to speak to you from two seats away on a running underground train.

So when this showed up on TV I thought to myself a new S King movie, could be interesting. Starts off as a fairly straight forward apocalypse movie, although these are not zombies but rather zombie like. Did I say straight forward? Well actually it is not, a 'phone signal triggers off the carnage with no logical explanation given. I can see some social commentary here, so many of us have these mobile 'phones attached to ours hands, spending so much time on them, that perhaps we are turning into ""phoners"", the word used in the movie to describe the infected.
I'm not much of a John Cusack fan but will watch anything with Samuel L in. There is plenty of violent action here but the ending is weird and I got the feeling that the whole thing was rushed."

Yes we've seen the zombie apocalypse thing done many times before, and better; yes it's basically a cross between 28 Days Later and Body Snatchers. But you don't have to be a genius to work out that this is a parable about us and the 'new technology'. As such I found the pay-off very striking: in our heads we're in paradise, but seen from the outside we're shuffling zombies.

Within minutes, the normal, rational, aggravating general public quickly become slavering, rabid killers. John Cusack, all Botox and hair-dye, stars alongside un-augmented Samuel L. Jackson as Clay and Tom, two bland but well-played people thrown together by the conflagration.I haven't read the book on which this is based, but I notice King is the screenplay's co-writer. The reason for the mass transformation into zombie-types (they revert into twitching human-looking killers rather than the more impressive, rotting cadaver variety - Cusack's plastic surgery makes him look a good deal less natural than the aggressors) is something to do with their cell-phones: hence the title.To me, this is what it is: a fairly ambiguous thing to say, I admit. It's just another zombie film, really. It boasts a decent budget, some effective set-pieces, some unconvincing effects and creatures that rely far too much on hordes of actors gurning than any particularly frightening make-up. It also gets deathly dull very quickly, I'm sorry to say. Little in the way of humour, and despite the lengthy bouts of dialogue, there's no real character development. It's all a bit strange and far from satisfying, as if despite King's involvement, no-one knew what kind of film they wanted to make.I was tempted to give up on this a number of times, but persevered in order to see if there was any kind of pay-off at the end.

Story seems like good at times but then they add those mind twisting parts that dont make any sense.CharactersClay was boring, like realy boring. Nothing new or exciting about him. All he wanted to do was find his son, instead of accepting reality that he was gone.Tom McCourt i liked him alot, he had accepted reality, was thinking like i would in zombie apocalypse.Alice was awesome, since she was traumatized about how she killed her mother and then later on by bad luck she died.Im not gonna write about the other characters since they werent much of important in the story except the Ray, but hes screen time was short.Not good, wouldnt reccomend"

I have to believe that the vast bulk of people who actually bought a movie ticket for this bomb wished they would have seen a different movie. When I see similar films in the genre I usually have a scene or two where it actually increased my heart beat. You don't get that with this film.

First of all John Cusack was acting like he was fulfilling a contractual obligation rather than trying to play a role, then we had the confusing editing/direction which made the film feel as though it was made from off-cuts and finally there was no explanation (as far as I can recall as I lost interest) for the phone attack. It ended up as a very poorly-resolved zombie movie. We were really disappointed as it could have been so much better."

It feels as if the low budget ran out mid filming and the end was so rushed it made no sense.

Sure it's not what people wanted though let's be real, 90% of the time it never is, especially when a movie is based upon a epic like Stephan Kings 'Cell'.

The book, to be fair, was never one of my favourite King offerings - it just didn't work for me. I found it far too generic a zombie-world offering and the characters did little to live in my memory.The film takes that and doesn't so much add nothing, it (unbelievably) reduces it.

I do like the subject of zombies but in the hands of King they ended up being ridiculous. This film version gets rid of some of the dumber elements from the novel - the levitation scenes, for example - but is still in no way good. Things are at their best in the early outbreak scene, which suffers from shaky camera syndrome a bit but is generally exciting if you can ignore the odd dodgy CGI shot of an exploding plane and the like. John Cusack, looking tired and bloated, is a poor choice of lead, while Samuel L. Jackson is purely on autopilot here and has none of the fire-and-brimstone charisma you see from him elsewhere. The film gets worse as it goes along, lacking suspense and saddled with unlikeable characters and cliched situations, until it ends on a scene which made me laugh out loud at the inept cheapness of it all."

Jackson acknowledges this film.You have Cusack figuring out that the mania is caused by phones in like, immediately. The head master has well, mastered these ""foners/phoners"" in like, immediately.

At least pretend that you think zombies exist before making such an accurate assessment. Damn Cusack.Perhaps I shouldn't even talk about that CG...

Firstly, honestly, I don't even understand that question. What does the ""fastness"" of it have to do with anything? Also, I don't know Samuel, I'll take a SHOT in the dark, unlike you who took it in broad daylight and say; ""Uhm, you shot a rifle, they heard it, they saw you"".And should we talk about that ending?

This movie is absolutely nothing, NOTHING like the original story, except for the very vague plot and character names. The book was filled with mystery and thrills but nope, not this movie! I guess maybe the creators thought using the original source material was a bad idea? If that is the case then WHY EVEN MAKE A MOVIE VERSION AT ALL??? I understand changes must be made but why change everything?? This movie is not smart or scary at all, no thrills or chills, just boring. SO BORING. The actors are so bored and have the same ""yeah, whatever"" faces. Sam Jackson is the only character with personality, and that is because he is just playing Sam Jackson. The story is also super confusing and makes no sense. Oh and the CGI is almost as bad as Jeepers Creepers 3...yeah, that bad. It looks like it belonged in a cartoon on Nickelodeon! So yeah, bad movie. And the ending is a huge middle finger to anyone who liked the book. Just...wow...what an awful movie."

Jackson, and Isabelle Fuhrman search for family members while occasionally stopping off to meet and kill both creatures and unstable humans alike, their crew growing and diminishing in predictable waves of tragedy and triumph.

The movie was actually not too bad until it got to the end. Did they lose the Stephen King book they borrowed the story from? Granted, I never read this one, but King doesn't write disjointed drivel. And the last quarter of this film was drivel. The story began dropping connection about as bad as these cellular zombies. I understand that the Ice Cream Truck was a mobile bomb intended to take out some ""Mother Cell Tower"" that droves of these cellular zombies were doing laps around. And the number on the cell phone that the head- bomber gave Cusack was a detonator trigger. But WTF was the ending? Did the cell tower go down or not. We see Cusack, the son, and the cell tower being consumed in a virtual mushroom cloud. But then we see Cusack and his boy walking the railroadtracks following the the TJD markings on the trees.

Son of a bitch. I really hate a movie that isn't too bad through most of it, but then it seems as though the writers smoked some poisoned crack and died so the director gathered various ideas from the film crew on how to end the film, but decided each of the three ideas were so kick-ass they put them all in and let the viewer figure it out....or drive them absolutely bat-schidt insane.

The first hour is very good and then it takes an abrupt nose dive into a 'shocker' ending, that is not shocking but stupid and a case of bad writing.Many writers seem to suffer from this syndrome of getting painted into a corner by their interesting high concept and then just bailing out rather than hunkering down and figuring out how to write a decent ending.None of the big questions are answered as to how this came about even though the characters spend a good bit of time speculating about it. There is some suggestion of a psychic 'The Stand' type connection and a Randall Flagg type, hoody wearing bad guy who may be controlling all of it, that goes absolutely nowhere and then the main character goes off in what seems to be a mission of self-sacrifice only to have it get turned around into a very unsatisfying ending that solves nothing. I often wonder how people read these scripts and don't realize there's no 3rd act.It was nice to see Jackson teamed with Cusack again. They should really do some Hope and Crosby type buddy movies and the teenage girl, Isabelle Fuhrman was good in what was essentially a throwaway role but bad writing sinks this one. Too bad."
" A modernized take on the horror of the post apocalypse, backed by Stephen King's writing and a decent cast.
",-0.5574,0.9855,2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"Cell (2016) was a great throwback type of horror flick. Entrenched in zombie visuals, add some King macro-universe building and mixed up enough so that typical 'virus outbreak' elements feel comfortably familiar. Picture a mix between I am Legend (or the original Omega Man), The Happening, and Dawn of the Dead. With that image in mind, you have a good representation of the film you're going into. If you have an hour and a half of time and want some good run-away-from-the-horde imagery, this should hit those buttons. As of 2017, the reviews on this movie were surprisingly negative, and I'm not entirely sure why.*MINOR SPOILER ZONE* Contains ravenous 28 days later zombies mixed with I Am Legend style bipeds. Classic Stephen King dialogue & story.PLOT- Cell, based on Stephen King's novel, and a screenplay which he contributed on, opens with a mass event wherein every cell phone owner receives a call at the same time that turns them into ferocious drones. Graphic artist, Clayton Riddell, is at an airport when the event takes place, wanting to see his son who is X-miles away.**MAJOR SPOILER FROM HERE DOWN** The action brings us to meet our core actors within the first 20-30 minutes. The dialogue feels well paced, and there's some classic hokey banter between Samuel Jackson (Tom) & John Cusack (Clay). Isabelle Fuhrman is perfect in bringing some of Alice's personality from the page.Once the film establishes its main cast, the movie can get rolling with its ties to the post-apocalypse event. There's a lot of travelling on foot between towns with barren New England-esque visuals.From here, if you haven't read the novel prior to this review or seeing the film, the plot starts gaining momentum as Clay searches for his family, Tom & Alice know they're better as a group so they tag along. Plus, everyone seems chummy so there's really no motivation the gang to split up. The on-screen chemistry is great between the main trio.They encounter other survivors, each mini-plot had a generally effective setup and pay off.The end has a little bit of a gut punch; at least it did for me. In fact, the movie did a good job of making you wonder how things were going to line up with the novel.THOUGHTS- The feeling of hopelessness, which I find important for making an effectively spooky zombie/apocalypse film, is all over this movie. The characters do the best they can with the situation, but they're still human characters. And mass murder/killing loved ones has repercussions.The script and source material shine through in all of the right ways, and the actors genuinely seem involved in the production.The ending felt like it was giving reference to a more cosmic/macabre style ending that The Mist story had. I would be interested to hear the author's thoughts on changing the climax in the way that they did.There are one or two other side characters that could have been given more depth, but I feel like they may have run low on time & budget."

But, before I saw the movie, I knew that for every Shining there is a Children of the Corn, and for every Misery there is a Cujo, or for every Shawshank there's a Lawnmower Man. So I had to approach the this film, of a King book I loved, with extreme caution. Why? Because I am not sure if it was even released theatrically and of course the reviews were almost ALL negative. But still, I thought maybe there would be something good about it, something redeeming that would make me enjoy it regardless of the bad reviews. After all, Stephen King wrote the screenplay and Cusack was an Executive Producer, so surely they aren't going to attach their names and hard work to something downright HORRIBLE. Well....THEY DID!!! This movie was bad on every conceivable level; writing, acting, special effects, editing and ESPECIALLY directing. It just SUCKED. There's no need to get into plot details or anything of that nature. The main point of this review is to warn you that if you watch this you will truly waste your precious time. Life isn't long enough to waste an hour an a half on this type of movie. Shame on all involved with this film for producing it. You all did a disservice, especially Mr. King, to the book by making it into THIS movie. As is so often listed in reviews, I only gave it a rating of 1 because they don't offer 0. This movie defines what a bad Stephen King film adaptation is.

" Just Another Substandard Film
",0.0,-0.9724,2017-10-14 00:00:00,1,"Stephen King adapted his own novel ""Cell"" with ""Paranormal Activity 2"" director Tod Williams and ""Standoff"" scenarist Adam Allena. Nevertheless, not even King's contribution in this forgettable film cannot salvage this momentarily imaginative but ultimately depressing spin on zombie sagas. Basically, some unknown, evil force contaminated all cellular communication with a pulse that transformed anybody on a cell phone into a zombie. The primary problem with ""Cell"" is neither King nor his collaborators provide a credible explanation for that mysterious cyber-connected malevolence that precipitated the pulse that turns mankind into zombies. Once they conjure up the cool idea that substitutes for the reason for zombies, ""Cell"" winds up being just another humdrum zombie flick. Mind you, as Clay Riddell, John Cusack plays a largely sympathetic protagonistâ€”he works as a graphic novelist--in search of his estranged wife and son after the pulse triggers the zombie apocalypse. The story becomes a journey of hardship for Cusack's woebegone father and his new friend Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson in a subdued performance) that they stick together once Cusack flees from the Boston Airport where everybody mutates into zombies. The idea that pulse transmissions could drive humans out of their minds and make them behave like flesh-eating lunatics wears off when our heroes gather a motley crew of survivalists and search for a refuge from the epidemic. Reportedly, King altered the ending of the movie to compensate for the ending in his novel that his public complained about. Sadly, neither Cusack nor Jackson bring anything either new or memorable to their characterizations. The villain--The Night Traveler, a creep in a red hoodie (with headphones)â€”qualifies as a half-baked but ugly adversary. ""Cell"" goes to Hell after its initial moments."

Most of Stephen King's flops usually start off good: interesting premise, interesting characters, interesting situation.Then, some time along the way, things fall apart. This is what happens in CELL, one of the latest Stephen King stories turned movie. The movie starts with Clay Ridell (John Cusack), calling his family from Boston's Logan airport when all of the sudden his phone's battery goes dead. He tries to continue his phone call form an airport phone booth when he starts noticing people around him going berserk and killing each other with their bare hands and with whatever is at hand. Ironically, only the people who were doing calls on their cell phones go nuts, turning them into modern day zombies (like those in 28 DAYS LATER and WALKING DEAD). Clay runs for his life until he reaches the subway station, where he meets a group of people also trying to escape the madness that's around. There he meets and befriends Tom McCourt (Samuel L Jackson). Clay convinces Tom to look for Clay's family, hoping they're still alive.The first half of the movie is actually very interesting, with lots of action, gory scares and with a good pace.The movie up until this point did well in getting my attention: ""Why are people turning into zombies?"", ""Why to they attack in groups, like flocks of birds?"", ""Why do they appear to be humming songs?"", and most importantly, ""Who is behind this? Aliens? The US Government? God?""Unfortunately, we are never ever given a clue as to WHY this stuff is happening? Who is behind this and what are the reasons of doing this people? Why cell phones??? It's obvious there's a social commentary quite visible stamped all over CELL: we people are becoming zombies, all day depending on our phones not only for making calls, but texting, tweeting, Facebooking, Instagramming, etc. I get the message, and it's a valid one, but WHY is this happening on the movie. We the audience never knows. We only know is that the signal is coming from an antenna nearby, but we never know who is running or who is sending this bizarre signal.The ending is bleak and lame at the same time. There's nothing cheery about it and I'm OK with that if the second half of the movie were any good but it wasn't. However brilliant Stephen King is as a writer, that doesn't always translate into a good scree writer. Tod Williams direction is not bad, but with a screenplay this bad, it's hard to come up with anything good.Watch CELL only if it's the only movie available on Netflix!"
" Complete failure all around
",-0.5106,-0.2764,2017-09-13 00:00:00,4,"Wow. Why was this movie made? John Cusack was quoted saying about this movie, ""I don't know what's going on with it. Stephen and I have been cut out of that one."" When you cut the main actors and the man who wrote the damn book out of the process of making the movie bad things happen. You know, you get problems like the movie doesn't come out for four years after it was made. Or there is no funding for a proper trailer. And can't forget no one wants to promote the movie who starred in it. There was only one saving grace to this movie. It was that the movie followed the storyline of the book quite faithfully. Well, all except the ending. Not saying the ending was bad, I actually preferred it to the book ending. The book ending was a bit far-fetched for my liking. The movie ending was a bit more believable. Although, could have done without the two false endings. With the caliber of acting that was in this movie you would expect more. But Mr. Cusack and Sam L. Jackson and Stacey Keach it would have been quite a bit better. But everyone just seemed to phone it in on this movie. This movie was a train wreck from the beginning. It should have never happened, but Cusack just pushed and pushed then got pushed out. No reason for it to happen.Rating: 4 out of 10That's it for me folks."

Except for the opening scene, that tricked me into watching the movie until the end, the whole movie is really bad: the acting, storytelling, music... I haven't read the book but I am sure that Steven King wasn't happy if he was unlucky to see it himself. The acting was insulting and the ending was a complete let down. It seemed like it was supposed to be a psychological drama set in a scary environment but sadly non of the two happened. The expressions on the faces of the possessed people were ridiculous as well as the sounds they were making and the main actors didn't seem to care to add any value to the movie because I am sure that they also couldn't wait for the movie to be over as well as I. I sincerely advice anyone who comes across this movie on TV to change the channel immediately."

The best actors award went to a little dog who looked in fear of its life of this, now mind controlled, human.John and Samuel were just bored, going through the motions.The movie's plot - now that was just pointless. So a signal goes through everyone's cellphones, which in turn, makes said people deranged murderous lunatics that work in groups. These deranged folk try and propagate more of themselves and kill anyone they don't particularly care for. At first everyone who did not use their cellphones, and later only, John, Sam and the gang, while the gang are plagued by images of a man in a red hoodie.Now red hoodie would have been alright if he was some evil mastermind, but he did absolutely nothing in the film. He just well came to an end. An end which included destroying a cellphone tower.Did red hoodie man start this? Was red hoodie man fiddling with cellphone towers? Was this the only cellphone tower that needed to be destroyed? Was it an evil supernatural force that took over one single cell phone tower? What was the point?

" Clumsily crafted and empty of effective thrills, this Stephen King-based thriller is a soulless trite that transpires to unintentional laughter
",0.765,-0.9883,2017-07-26 00:00:00,1,"This grim apocalyptic thriller based on Stephen King's novel of the same name brings out the worst in film adaptations of acclaimed novels. Desolate of originality and lacking any remote sense of authenticity, this film places Hollywood veterans John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, who last collaborated in another Stephen King- based horror entity '1408', in an apocalyptic bore. Progressing from unintentional hilarity to slow-paced tediousness, it leaves you wonder if director Tod Williams was falling asleep on the job. Even if the main concept of the story was awkward enough, there is no doubt that the director and writers could injected just a little more effort to craft the film into something more effective, if not blossoming with startling scares. So what is the story here? Just another zombie thriller centered on a small group of survivors fighting to survive against a world gone mad, only sillier and far less convincing to leave even the least demanding viewers to feel invested in. This film follows Clay Riddell (played by John Cusack), a man at an airport heading back to New England to return with his wife and son. When making a call, Clay grows confused to the deteriorating phone network. Suddenly, a mysterious signal goes off in the mobile phone networks around the world, causing people go haywire and turn into mindless, zombie-like savages. With everyone in the airport going mentally psychotic, killing each other, foaming from the mouth, and jumping off balconies to their deaths, Clay meets up with one of the few uninfected man Thomas McCourt (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and later a young teen survivor named Alice Maxwell (played by Isabelle Fuhrman) to make it across America and find his wife and son, while surviving against the onslaught of ravenous beasts. What is it exactly behind the signal that causes everyone around the world to turn into mindless savages? I have no clue, because the film never dedicates any time to explore that, nor does it boast enough to effort for us to even care. The film amounts to just about nothing by one unconvincing zombie showdown after another, with a trio of fine actors hamming it in their roles with despicably rancid dialogue. The opening scene in the airport, which is supposed to be the hallmark of the story, is so clumsily executed to the point where you find yourself struggling to hold back laughter. A large crowd of individuals shaking and slumping into violent seizures, biting each other's necks, whacking each other with hard objects, slamming their heads into the walls, and assaulting our ears with their horrendous high-pitched screams; as jarring as it may sound, this entire sequence is soul-crushing to sit through not because of the relentless gore and grisly casualties that fill the screen, but because of how sloppy it is. To add insult to injury, it is a sad story that continues throughout the remainder of the story, which is completely devoid of suspense of even an emotional touch for viewers to engage when things go south. And it certainly does no justice when the cinematographer feels the need to batter these scenes with frantic camera-work to render the action incomprehensible. As for the cast, nobody including John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Isabelle Fuhrman bring their A-game to the table. Whether is the dialogue or their failure to deliver their lines with diligence, their performances make it difficult to leave us invested in their characters, although it is not of all their fault considering the flat nature of the script. Cell is a clumsily crafted science-fiction horror entity that lacks any effective thrills or suspense to keep things even remotely interesting. It is a sad attempt at bringing yet another Stephen King novel to life on the silver screen. Even if the film lacked potential of straying into the category of a groundbreaking entry in the genre, we definitely deserve an adaptation of King's works that is a little better than this to say the least."

Clay Riddell (Tom Cusack) is on his phone in the airport when his battery dies whilst speaking to his son. With no charging ports available or any payphones available he is unable to ring his son back. To the viewers relief we see the everyone who had a cellphone fall to the ground in pain knowing if he was on the phone he would be in the same state. Clay is left standing there when everyone starts attacking each other. After some time trying to escape the maniacs Clay makes his way to the underground train station where he meets Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson). The both of them head back in to the city to Clay's apartment where they try to understand what is happening in the world. After some time there they are met by banging on the door, which turns out to be one of Clay's neighbours who's name is Alice Maxwell (Isabelle Fuhrman). All 3 of them head head out to venture towards Clay's home in hope that his wife and son are not affected by the signal. Whilst venturing out they come across a school in which a student called Jordan (Owen Teague) and the headmaster (Stacy Keach) have survived. The headmaster shows the survivors a whole football field full of the techno zombies in which they are asleep on the floor with music playing from their mouths. The headmaster also tells the survivors that he thinks that this is the next stage in human evolution; one integrated network.SummaryThere is clearly more to this story than I have told you but the rest you will just have to find out for yourself when you watch the film. You can see the full story of the movie on Sky Cinema and on DVD.I did enjoy the movie quite a bit, it's World War Z like zombies grasped me the moment the signal broke out and turned everyone to maniacs. You hope throughout the movie that Clay finds his wife and son or at least his son so that they can both try to survive the apocalypse together. I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of sci-fi, horror, drama or action.Just as a side note the ending is one that most viewers will find strange or ""stupid"" but I do love these types of endings and unknown to me, I don't know whether this was coincidence or the film makers intended to for the ending music to be the Liverpool FC anthem. Either way enjoyed I the ending.RatingsStory: 12/20 Cast: 14/20 Enticement: 18/20 Entertainment: 16/20 Recommend: 17/20 Overall I would rate Cell: 77/100"

Have you ever seen a movie that fits exactly with the book it was based on???OK, many reviewers may say that this is the worst adaptation ever, but I think differently: Due to the fact that the screenplay was co-written by Stephen King himself, and he estates that the ending of this movie was written especially because of the readers that complained about the book's ending, I guess he played a little bit with his own story, to give us, fans, some variations. He already did it with the TV Series ""Under the Dome"" and more.I am a musician, and, as a composer, I love to make variations with my own melodies... for a creative worker it's a lot of fun.I won't tell you to watch this movie or to avoid watching it, just give artists a try, but NEVER compare a movie with the book it is based on.Open your mind and you will find out that every version of the same main story has its pros and cons.Enjoy movies just the way you enjoy books.Greetings!"

" Ultimately impenetrable, but high-class zombie sci-fi
",0.0,0.9883,2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Ever imagined what would happen if zombies of the familiar ""Walking Dead"" kind became as fast as those in ""28 Days Later"", but were also guided in their behaviour (e.g. able to climb stairs and ladders), very ready to attack and kill but NOT capable of passing on their undead status to others by biting? Ever thought that that might represent a step forward in terms of zombie-dystopia plot subtlety, and at the same time be pretty darn scary? Well, here is the Tod Williams-Stephen King film ""Cell"" to show us - persuasively, if not quite flawessly - how the above suggestions might be true, with a swipe taken at mobile phones and the Internet as we go along.In many ways ""Cell"" is the kind of intelligent stuff we've been looking forward to, and it boasts adequate-to-fine acting (most especially from a superb Samuel L. Jackson as the thoroughly-plausible Vietnam Vet railway worker Tom McCourt), very nice cinematography and suitably-atmospheric urban and rural New England settings, and dialogue with quite a bit of wisdom and even wit (yes, really).Tradition is not eschewed entirely here - there's an initial airport scene (what else?) in which mobile phones ensure that our normal world goes to ***t, or goes to hell, depending on how you see it - in a matter of seconds; and this is really supremely evocative. There's also an ""academic in an exclusive countryside-located school tries to explain the brave new world in a moment of respite scene (a la BBC ""Survivors"", ""Dr Who"", ""The Day of the Triffids"", ""Forbidden Planet"" and various other sources), and a besieged rural hostelry scene.Sadly, it does seem that this film does its best work at the start, and that's a shame. Indeed, the final bits do tend to get a bit incomprehensible, if certainly remaining impressive and pretty scary. On the plus side, this piece is mostly quite unpredictable, making it unnerving in another way too, and this extends even to the tangibly-sad loss of key characters we've come to like. Not bad for about 95 minutes of high-class watching that does leave the watcher wanting more.True sci-fi buffs should certainly check this out for themselves, and not be swayed by the more negative reviews of ""Cell"" to be found here, or the lowish overall score it receives."

Now, Stephen King is my favorite writer and I have to say I'm kinda used to directors butchering his work when they make movies out of them, so I already had low expectations UNTIL I heard about John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. I thought ""Huh, this HAS to be a good movie with these people in it, finally!"". Got REALLY excited, because this book had a lot of potentials to make one of the best movies out of it. Well, I started watching it with a big smile on my face and in a really good mood. After approx. 10 minutes it quickly changed. I have to admit I didn't even make it halfway through. I tried, I tried really hard to finish it out of respect, but couldn't bring myself to do it. I had to shut it off. I was disappointed and in disbelief.

First, it screams rip off of ""The Signal"" (2007) and I am unsure if that movie had any relation to the Stephen King book either. Either way, the movie is about a signal through cell phones that drives everyone basically insane. Although in this movie, that insanity is very tame. The very good cast just doesn't seem invested into making this movie anything else but mediocre. And I am a huge fan of both Jackson and Cusack. In attempting to find the cause to get rid of the signal, so to speak, we are just subjected to an array of scenes, not really a story per se. It is too bad and I think the film makers knew it since they treat us to a really bad ending after all that which doesn't do anything to resolve, sum up, or entertain for that matter. I am pretty disappointed to say the least. Find the previous movie I already mentioned. Much more well rounded version of the exact same story."

I rarely write reviews unless the movie is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. I did see the overall rating at 4.3 and could not believe it! From the initial scenes when everything goes crazy, to the end of the movie seeing J Cusack's character walking at the end of the film left me shocked and open jawed! You would think the generic scene where the lone person will not acknowledge those speaking to them, then they turn around and are a monster is too predictable. It is somewhat also predictable in this film but differs in that it still shocks and the mayhem that ensues grabs you. The red hoodie dude...genius...transmission through their mouths...genius and creepy. Nothing I have seen before comes close to this movie in tenseness, sadness, violent but necessary scenes. When movies such as Star Wars, and Harry Potter X are lauded as great films, it is such a shame that great movies such as this one are not given enough credit. I will now read a few reviews from this site. I expect to see wanna-be film critics nit picking details and trying to seem deeper than they are.

This has a really strong beginning, but I can see that many people feel there is some big letdowns during the rest of it. You can argue about the ending (I'd say it's predictable), but the question is if you like how it's build up to that point.If you didn't like the premise you probably won't like the movie either. It's a bit crazy to think what being connected all the time has done to us. So there is an urgency to what the movie is trying to tell us. Still it feels like it's set years ago, making it outdated even before the first frame starts. Having two charismatic lead actors helps a little bit.

There was gore (of which I am not even a fan but here was quite appropriate), action and most of all quite a lot of tension. I have to admit I gaped at the screen for at least a full minute when all hell broke loose.However, as the narrative evolved, both the events and dialogues felt forced, despite Cusack's and Jackson's talent. I had quite a lot of trouble accepting let alone enjoying Jackson's performance. What a shame.It's obviously a plot motivated story, both to figure out how to deal with what is happening and to get the main character reunited with his son, because there sure isn't room to care about any of the other characters.Still, I couldn't even care for the two main ones. And they sure seemed to embrace the whole apocalyptic scenario quite well.Also, the only time we get even close to an explanation is when the characters get to the school and after that it all just goes downhill. A complete waste of time.The pace becomes incredibly slow at some point and I was actually bored. The creepy factor was so underused. Boy oh boy there was so much potential there to give me nightmares.The ending was predictable and some things just did not make any sense, like the red-hooded character.With so many movies of the genre out there, I cannot say I recommend this one. It could have been so much better. I just don't understand how King himself was a co-writer and this is what came out to the public. What a disappointment.Extra star for the premise and actors, who sadly were not even given a chance to perform at their best."
" Another bad Stephen King adaptation.
",-0.5423,-0.9312,2017-02-24 00:00:00,4,"""Cell"" was not my favourite Stephen King book; It was one of my least favourite of his works and for some of the same reasons as this film.The first thing that made me sigh with apprehension was a film company calling themselves ""The Genre Company"" - Nice of them to choose a story which doesn't sit well in a genre. For me, this isn't a Horror film as a lot of the elements of horror are lacking, suspense and tension aren't even a part of this film. That said, they're missing from the novel as well. There is only rudimentary aspects of drama in the film as it's too short to build up any characters that you can relate to, and when one of the main characters are killed the viewer feels very little. So I'm not inclined to call it a Drama. This is a shame as Stephen King is the master of believable and relatable characters, even when they're placed in extraordinary situations; it's even more of a shame as Mr King also wrote the screenplay. There's some action thrown in, but again, not too much. The only genre that suits this film would be Science Fiction; but that would also be a loose fitting.I liked the idea of a pulse being transmitted through the cell phones and turning the user into a raving maniacal killing machine, this is a fresh take on the Zombie, though King doesn't leave it there, he has them keep evolving into something completely different.I can understand the people transmitting the pulse as their voiceboxes are manipulated to make the transforming sounds. However, the scene with the changelings at the University is ludicrous, to say the least.The main trouble with the story is the lack of reason. You are never told why the cell phones started transforming people or what the changelings will finally transform into. Handled correctly it could have given the movie a more ominous feel, but everything is shot in a nonchalant way that it's dull and boring. If this was what the director Tod Williams had planned, then he was wrong.I like John Cusack, though I didn't like his performance in the other King movie adaptation ""1408"" though that was better than this one. However, I can probably put that down to the lacklustre direction of the movie. There were only two actors who stood out in this film; Samuel L Jackson as Tom McCort, for once he doesn't give his usual tough guy performance, here he's a normal guy; the other is Stacy Keach who does a good job of portraying a stoic and phlegmatic headmaster of the University.To make this film worth watching you would have to go back to the drawing board. I think if you took the Peter Jackson approach to this story and turned it into a trilogy, it would allow you to build the characters and implement the ""Road Trip"" feel of the book into the film.I am still waiting for a good Stephen King movie adaptation... will it be IT? Could it be The Gunslinger? Living in hope..."
" forgettable, but not necessarily terrible
",0.5157,0.9893,2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Considering I went into Cell with abysmally low expectations, it turned out to be not too bad. Not that this necessarily means that it's all good, but there are some good things I can say about this. I'm pretty sure, from what I've heard about the book (at best it's liked but not loved, sort of a middle-tier King work, not one of his triumphs but not a failure either, something fun he could knock off in a month or two as one of those 'hey this is happening in the real world, I'll use it for one of my spooktacular stories' things) that this actually makes for an accurate assessment. It's a standard-issue zombie-ish story of people being infected and going bugf*** insane, only this time King (who also gets a screen writing credit) adds a kind of bird-pulse-hive-mind thing that only gets explained enough to move the plot along.Maybe in the book it was explained more or better; here, it seems like some weird and borderline lame (or just lame) device to keep us sort of on our toes, like, 'oh, hey, this time they're *not* vomiting blood on one another or eating brains, and any gunshot can kill them, not just the head, gotcha, thanks.' But more lame than that is the generic story thing of 'well, my son and ex are somewhere, and I'm gonna go find them' when, naturally, it's not going to be pretty or something he likes when he finds out (that he being Cusack, who is doing the best he can with fairly weak-tea material). Meanwhile, Samuel L Jackson does his best Ken Foree (intentional or not) from Dawn of the Dead, and is a reason to see the movie - even in the midst of some mediocre writing or plotting, or moments that can make one groan, he's there to work and it's not something to be embarrassed about on his resume.As for the action, it's... fair. I guess I may be tired of seeing action shot with the shutter off (that's when the camera has this function that makes it go, oh, nevermind, you know it when you see it), and I think Tod Williams is a competent director of action but not one who can make things as thrilling as it should be. By the time you see one character go to a door slowly - not in this, I mean in any other movie you've ever seen in your lives - you've seen them all, and this has a lot of that. And while at one time I felt apprehensive about Eli Roth being the director, as he was attached for a period of time after the book first came out (his movies tend to be Dumb with a capital, sometimes double, D), now I'd be curious as to what he might have changed or made more visceral or f***ed up.Cell goes through the motions, has some decent atmosphere, and a couple of those strange touches that I'm sure come from that primordial cavern that is King's sub(or regular)consciousness - such as the whole aspect of how these beings screech and them come together (which is a fascinating sight to me), or Stacy Keach having the whole football stadium of infected asleep listening to the... is that the yodeling from that Christopher Lee mashup from LOTR online(?) But there's not enough of it to make it stand out; while I haven't seen enough of it to make a full comparison, my gut tells me this is, to the lay-person, Walking Dead lite, with some good actors doing their best and only rising to meet the absolute minimum required.... okay, maybe the ending is a little terrible, but my rating still stands."

There's some good ideas at work but the film never delivers on its promise, even serving up an ending that defies patience as well as logic.

Why? One simple reason... The ending. By the point of ending, the movie was so far removed from the plot of the novel as to be barely recognisable to anyone who has read it. Then they threw an ending at us that was just a mess of convoluted ideas, all executed to the lowest possible standard. Once you sort out the jigsaw puzzle ending - bearing in mind that this is a 7000 piece jigsaw with 10 extra pieces and no edges - you're left with a dismal conclusion to what was already a disappointing adaptation of an excellent novel. Not only does the ending leave a sour taste in its wake, it essentially renders everything that happened in the 90ish minutes leading up to it completely meaningless. It doesn't just make them a bitter memory, it makes them completely irrelevant and obsolete. It also leaves a god awful song stuck in your head from which, if you're me anyways, you only know one verse that just keeps cycling around when you least expect it.

We waited.... and waited.... and waited. Through distribution problems it took years for the film to be released and it was so hush hush I even missed it at the cinema. Then one rainy Sunday it came on my Now TV and I settled in. There are a lot of changes to the bus. The opening sequence is held at an airport rather than the edge of a city park, harnessing the current threat of terrorism for the travelling community. The film then stays almost true to the book, the dynamics between Cusack and Jackson could have been played out a little better but that instant trust in a crisis shines through. The rest of the film is enjoyable but lacks the suspense and urgency of the book. It is the ending that really lowers the film. The original ending left you with a sense of 'What If'. I know some fans complained at this but I thought it left you with just the right questions. Here the story ends on an absurd final sequence where our hero succumbs to the signal's virus and becomes another mindless Zombie. Talk about no hope for survival. I enjoy movies like this and there was so much hope for Cell, but the ending seems rushed and the distribution kept quiet by the studio. This is the first time I have been hoping for a speedy remake."
" Cell phone users beware.
",0.0,-0.8781,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"CELL is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. King actually gets writer credit as well as being co-writer of the screenplay. John Cusack plays Clay Riddell, who is in the Boston airport and witnesses a bizarre scene. Hundreds of cell phone users are turned into manic killers. You do not dare answer a ringing cell. Clay is wanting to find his estranged wife and young son, so he teams with train driver Tom McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson) to dodge through the mob of murdering ""phoners"". The city has basically turned into a war zone.The finale is disappointing and is not much better or cleaner meaning than the novel itself. At times, I wonder how much input Mr. King actually had with this movie. Anita Ward's hit song ""Ring My Bell"" is used to eerie effect. All in all, a worthwhile thriller directed by Tod Williams.Also in the cast: Isabelle Fuhrman, Owen Teague, Joshua Mikel, Erin Elizabeth Burns, Stacy Keach and Ethan Andrew Casto."
" No care or effort put into it
",0.25,0.831,2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Stephen King has had a huge number of his stories developed into films over the years. A few have resulted in some of my favourite films of all time, others like 'Cell', are quite the opposite and it can be hard to believe that these all came from the same writer. How can someone write something as incredibly brilliant as 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Green Mile', and also be responsible for something as mindless and uncreative as 'Cell'? It boggles the mind.The biggest problem with this film is that it never tries to be smart. Right from the start the audience is given the middle finger and told you are basically in for a thoughtless zombie movie with less creativity than we've even come to expect from those over the years. What I expected was some bold and intelligent underlying themes, acting as a commentary on how humans have become so unbelievably reliant on cellphones. King is smart enough and capable of writing something thought-provoking like this, he simply chose not to.The acting is embarrassingly bad from almost everybody in this film. Even John Cusack, who I usually love, phones it in. You could almost see in his performance how much of a mistake he knew he'd made signing on. The only person who impressed me was Samuel L. Jackson. To be fair he didn't have to do a lot, and the role was perfectly suited to him, but he still gives the best performance of the entire cast. There's really nothing to see here. It's a lazy, dull and insulting film that should never have been made. Go and watch 'The Green Mile' again instead."
" I created a profile because this movie was so terrible
",-0.4572,0.2482,2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"Let's get a couple of things straight, from the get-go. I'm not a guy that professes to know much about the making of movies. I'm also a guy that loves Stephen King books. Also I understand that when one enjoys a book, one is usually critical of the corresponding movie, to some degree at least. The book 'Cell' was not vintage King in my opinion, but an enjoyable enough read. Perhaps 7/10. I've read it a few times and it's OK. This movie... How do I begin to describe this movie? I went into it with no bias. I simply saw that it was a movie adaptation of a book that I thought was good-ish. Movie adaptations of King's books are wildly hit and miss. For every Shawshank, there are two 'A Good Marriage's. This movie elevates those poorly received King movies to 'Stand by Me' status. Had it been possible to leave less than a single,solitary star, 'Cell' would have received that. What is wrong with the movie? As I said, one is often left slightly chagrined when a beloved book is defiled by the necessary trimming to fit into movie format; those little quirks of characters or tangential story lines fall by the way side, important details left out. Well, this movie does that in bucketfuls. From the opening scene until the bizarre ending, this movie manages exclude any detail from the book that may have made you feel any kind of emotion toward any of the characters. Quite a feat in itself. The pacing of the movie is not terrible, but a fast-moving turd is still a turd. My poor wife had little inkling as to what she was watching. I managed to guide her through it but I felt embarrassed to have said ' This is a good story'. Had I not read the book, this movie would make little sense. Yes, the bare bones are there but all of the character of the story has been washed away. I felt no sympathy toward any of the characters, even the children. In the book, one of the best characters was the Headmaster. That scene was very disappointing. However, I think the end was the worst aspect. I really wasn't expecting that to be the end. Completely different from the book. A total anti-climax. Perhaps that is the wrong word as that would suggest that some kind of tension had been built when it hadn't. It really hadn't. It's not often I find myself apologising to people regarding a movie I have subjected them too. Especially when the premise and cast were, if not stellar, then at least decent. I fear for my beloved 'Dark Tower' and it's future release..."
" The joys of text
",0.4939,0.1098,2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Cell is a post apocalyptic road film. A powerful phone signal turns many people to almost mindless violent zombies. In effect the mobile phone signal has reprogrammed them.John Cusack plays a graphic artist artist trying to make it back to his home to be with his family. He teams up with other survivors including Samuel L Jackson. In the daytime they have to avoid or confront these mindless people, at night they tend to be safer as the mindless hordes are resting. Soon the survivors have similar visions, especially of a man in a red hoodie who might be controlling everyone including the survivors.Cell is based on a book by Stephen King. The film looks low budget and cheap despite the cast. It is not much of a horror film after the initial violence scenes. We get little by way of an explanation as to why this has happened or what caused it?The film is silly but entertaining enough even though the film had post production issues. The end title credits suggest that the events could all be in Cusack's head."
" In dire need of a 12-Step program for floundering actors
",-0.4588,-0.6381,2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"Obviously, John Cusack needs professional help at this point. As the executive producer and lead actor in this steaming pile of $***, he is either insane, addicted to multiple street and psychiatric drugs, or teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. Please, people, do not enable him by paying to see this movie. He needs to hit rock-bottom before he can recognise that he has turned into a parody of a parody of himself, and should either die or quit acting until someone who is NOT insane can recommend a decent script to him. Again, DO NOT ENABLE John Cusack by patronising this utter garbage. It is up to him to acknowledge he is beyond human aid, that he needs some higher power to restore him to non-crappiness."
" Concerned Warning About ""Phone Zombies""...A Scary & Creepy Reality
",-0.6808,-0.9424,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"This Stephen King Adaptation (adapted by the King himself) was put ""On Hold"" for Three Years (distributor problems). The Problems Manifested after its Release with almost Unanimous Bad Reviews from Fans and Critics.Here's a Theory...People did not Respond Well to the Premise of the Film because They Love Their Phones to an Unhealthy Degree. They Love Their Phones and a Story where the Phone is the Bringer of Evil and Determined to Subjugate the Human Race and Replace it with a ""Hive or Collective"" Species where Individuals are No More then a ""Cell"" in One Organism, can certainly cause a Disturbance and Interference in the 'Un-Godly"" Bond Between Humans and Their Phones.So with that Gobbledygook, it is Understanding that when a Story Points to a Loved One as Pure Evil it's Not Going to Sit Very Well with the Masses. Truth be Told, it's About Time Someone Said Something about ""Phone Zombies"", and this Movie at least is Trying to Communicate a Warning, but No One is Listening. ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" it seems to be Saying.It's a Slightly Above Average ""Zombie"" Movie where it is Clear that Something is Adrift in the Storytelling and the Execution but it's Not All Bad. The Film has its Moments with John Cusack and Samuel Jackson Underplaying Their Predicament and there are some Horror Moments and Creepy Scenes. But the Confusing Ending was a Misstep that could have been Easily Avoided."
" Poor Movie from Poor Novel
",-0.5994,-0.817,2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I have read some of Stephen King's novels but after reading CELL, I didn't read any more. I found it poor in concept and that bizarre other worldliness that some of his novels have didn't fit.The movie is not any better. The on-set of the ""effect"" was interesting in how fast it happened. That fact people affected travelled in groups and retained some intelligence had the potential to be scary. Lots of plot holes the main one being the cell phone transmission. Yes many of us use the phone but unlikely in any given space 50% of the people would be on the phone. As it became quickly apparent what was causing the problem then 50% of the citizens would have been unaffected and likely 90% of the military. The roads were unblocked for the most part so no explanation for not using a car to drive the bulk of the distance. Instead of taking a few days, it could have been done in an afternoon.It is worth watching if you are really bored or need a nap.There was a time when John Cusack did good movies. Lately not so much and I think it was the Ex Producer of this as well."
