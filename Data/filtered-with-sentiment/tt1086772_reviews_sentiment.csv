" Incorrigible
",0.0,0.9924,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"This is typical Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore fair: it is big and brash and loud and silly and a bit clumsy.It is very easy to get sniffy at this, but I must admit that this made me and my girlfriend chuckle more than a few times.This is definitely not one to be taken seriously.It has less wit then say 50 First Dates but is quite warm and tender in its way.The story and the jokes are not particularly new, it is too long and the production and acting is inconsistent.But saying that we were both smiling when the end credits ran.If you are the sort of person who likes to deconstruct films and study how groups of people are represented in film then this will be a goldmine for you - despite having trans characters there is enough possibility of upset here for several episodes of your podcast.Not my cup of tea but it was good fun and part of me is happy that Happy Madison still belts these out."
" WELL BLENDED!!!
",0.4545,0.8157,2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Just seen this!!!!
A person cannot phantom the meaning of that title(BLENDED) without having watched this movie. It's really sweet and deep in it's meaning.
Terry Crews' thrilling lecture on it's meaning too is sooooooooo funny.Packed with lessons too. Your presence as a parent in the lives of your children is very vital in their growth stage. Some kids do well all by themselves but others, not at all."

" Enjoyable yet predictable
",0.4404,0.9819,2021-01-14 00:00:00,6,Blended is the 3rd Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore movie after The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. Here they play Jim and Lauren two single parents who end up going on a blind date that goes wrong and they end up going to Africa with their kids. But will romance blossom between the two.Like their last two outings you know how this film is gonna end as both Sandler and Barrymore have amazing chemistry in this film and they are really likeable in their movies.If you love The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates then you'll enjoy it. Terry Crews co stars alongside Shaq O Neil. The guy from The Wedding Singer Alex Arquette(rip) makes a surprise cameo in the end.
" No
",-0.296,-0.9042,2021-01-13 00:00:00,2,"Drew Barrymore is worse than her bad usual, and Terry Crews is very bad as always.

" Love MOST of Adam Sandler's Movies...
",0.6369,0.9368,2020-12-29 00:00:00,9,"And this falls into the category of one of the ones I love. The chemistry between Mr Adam Sandler and Ms Drew Barrymore is infectious and makes for some great movie moments. The one thing I didn't like and / or understand in Blended is the Terry Crews character. He serves no purpose and doesn't add to the film at all. His random 'pop in' singing doesn't make sense to me at all. Other than the Terry Crews character, this is a good romantic comedy to relax and watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon!!!"

" Could have been better
",0.4404,0.3255,2020-11-12 00:00:00,4,"It took me 3 days to finish this movie. I kept getting bored and turning it off and wasn't very compelled to come back to it. I think it could have been much better. I love Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, but this was just not interesting or funny enough. Just like most comedies of more recent times, they try too hard to be funny and end up being cringeworthy instead. I only laughed out loud once and I can't even remember why now. The kids in it were mostly horrible and it was just far too predictable for me. Don't get me wrong, I've seen much worse movies in my lifetime, but I definitely won't be watching this one again."

The movie is just a storm of emotions... First you can laugh, then you can be a little sorry, and then you can be excited a moment later. So did Frank Coraci, along with a fantastic team, with great actors. All feelings and emotions are real. I am very happy that such films still exist."

Never been a fan of Sandler or Barrymore but this one completely changed my view, they were perfect as they were in 50 first dates."

",0.6239,0.9931,2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie and have seen it plenty of times and every time it's worth it. The chemistry between the kids and the leads are undeniable. The romance has a fantastic buildup and the leads make it all the more worth it. The jokes are hilarious and never get old. The story is heartwarming and gives me an overall happy feeling. The whole idea of the dad having all girls and the mom having all boys played out really well. They ended up building and helping each others families out. The acting is great and Terry Crews is honestly really funny. Overall, it's the best."

" This... this surprised me
",0.2263,0.9891,2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"This... this surprised me. 'Blended' is exceptionally very good, something I did not expect to be saying in this review.Any synopsis for this would make you fear the worst, as you'd expect it to be one of those average Adam Sandler films with low quality humour and extremely lazy characters played by a poor cast. However, this film somewhat incredibly manages to make everything work; it even has heart to it.Sandler, first of all, is actually pretty amusing as Jim. Across the opening few scenes it looks like another clich√©, crappy character but as the production goes on we surprisingly get a bit more depth with him. Likewise with the rest, I feel we get enough of an understanding to go alongside the humour.Drew Barrymore is enjoyable as Lauren, she and Sandler have very good chemistry. The child actors are nicely chosen too, with Bella Thorne (Hilary), Emma Fuhrmann (Espn - yes, really) and Braxton Beckham (Brendan) all earning their stripes - I wasn't cringed out by any of them once, which is impressive. Even the side characters here are fun, Terry Crews and Abdoulaye N'Gom are likeable in their respective roles of Nickens and Mfana.I did not see this one coming, I was ready to dislike it. Instead, it becomes (at time of reviewing) my second favourite Sandler film; behind 'Click'."

There be too many moment if I named them all. The romance was great. They had fantastic Chemistry together. This movie has great plot, storyline, characters, character development in it. I loved that it talked about a famlies who parents fall in love after the first person they married left. Plus this movie has two really good actors in this movie. One being Adam sander. The other one I forget her name by the actor who plays the mother who fall in love with adma sander charcter is also a great actor. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
" Not funny at all
",-0.3412,-0.6748,2020-04-09 00:00:00,2,"I didn't smile or laugh a single time during the whole film.
The story was typical of romance and the plot was partly boring.
Overall, this was one of the worse movies with Adam Sandler."
" Garbage embarrassment of a film
",-0.4404,0.494,2020-03-29 00:00:00,1,"The Wedding Singer and the on-screen chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore was amazing. It's still a fantastic movie to watch even with silly, but clever lines.This movie, however, is absolute dreck because the writing is infantile. The actors did what they could but the characters were absolutely unlikeable. The young actors were awful as well.The entire trip to Sun City is so embarrassing, I switched the channel after the basketball court scene with the teen daughter and the African men singing or whatever onto the court.Thank goodness this was was broadcast on tv vs going to the theater so never spent a dime.Avoid."

This movie might not be a solid 10 but gets one because of imbeciles like this that want to suck the fun out of everything.There is also accurate and true to life emotion about the way children deal with death, dating and parents that might seek to remarry.GOOD SHOW OLD CHAP"

It is just that the over usage of feel goodness and non reality moments which just brought down the overall quality of content this movie could deliver.
Just another romcom with some scenes probably shot in Africa where most of the comic relief happens. 10/10 I will forget the movie name the next month.
Watched it on Netflix."

" Good Message, Not a Good Movie
",0.7003,0.8125,2019-12-18 00:00:00,6,"""Blended"" is not a good movie. Starring Drew Barrymore (as Lauren) and Adam Sandler (as Jim), the two silver screen lovers rekindle their on-screen romance for a third time, after earlier successes with ""Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates.""I am sucker for Adam Sandler movies. It's like the magazines that women can't resist on the checkout counter at the grocery store, Sandler is my kryptonite. Cheesy, predictable, romantic, funny - it sucks me in. This movie had even more gravity in my current circumstance, it is probably not a movie I would have ever picked up before 2018. Now going on eight months post-divorce, the realities of life and the day-to-day seem to be catching up with me. Single again with three kids in tow half of the time, you have to find things to do with the rest of the time.Goofy jokes and unlikely coincidences aside, there were some redeeming parts of the movie that I connected with. As a single parent, the idea that now my kids got 100% of my time resonated with me. Having them half of the time, I want to spend every possible moment with them making memories, being there for them, being a good dad. In the movie, Lauren and Jim correct the statement that the kids need 99% of your time, and as a parent we are allowed to have 1% for ourselves.""Blended"" as a movie was not very good, but the sappiness, the relationships, the escapism, and ultimately, the message made up for its flaws. It wasn't so horrible ;-)"

",0.0,-0.2884,2019-11-07 00:00:00,2,"With the male and female lead, thought it would be good, as 50 first dates, and the wedding singer. Wow was i wrong. I'm wondering if the folks who rated 6-10 viewed another movie.Story was unbelievable, not even movie believable. We are lead to believe that the majority of movie takes place in africa. Each party taking advantage of a rich guys family vacation that he cannot cancel. Both act surprised to see each other when they both arrive at the resort. I guess they didnt see each other on the airline, where they would have been seated next to each other, or the 2 hours at the airport. Lets not forget that both parents and all 5 kids would have needed counterfeit ID and passports to pull off the identify switch.A ton of unnecessary wildlife footage is inserted, but it does save us from the the script.Terry crews keeps making appearances as a singing hotel staff member, but speaks with a jamaican accent. Maybe hes hurting for money, and needed the work.Theres the ""out of gas scene"", and appearance of exhusband, and a bunch more i could complain about, but ill spare you.Glad i picked up at the library for free. I will never get back the time i wasted watching this crap, but if i had to pay for it, it would be worse. Please dont waste your time and money."

I don't understand why this has a 6.5 and Jack and Jill is rated among the worst movies of all time. It's not THAT bad of a movie really, but it's definitely a pretty bad movie. People say it's one of the best recent Adam Sandler movies, but in my opinion it's trash. I still recommend it because I guess my opinion isn't universal, but I don't understand why people like it. The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates are both great, and this one is easily horrible in comparison. I gave it a 3/10, which may be a little low. It may be able to pull a 4, but I lowballed it because it definitely doesn't deserve a higher rating :)"

I watched this movie because it was on Comedy Central and I didn't bother to change it.I was pleasantly surprised. It was a lot funnier than I expected.Jim (Sandler) and Lauren (Barrymore) are two single parents. They had a blind date and it failed miserably, but through fate they ended going on an African vacation together. It's clear that Lauren could use some help and advice raising her two boys and Jim could definitely use help raising his three girls.As they stumbled in aiding on another a romance budded (naturally). It wasn't a passionate thing just a small spark like, ""You're not that bad.""Sandler stayed away from his yelling for the most part. He broke it out once or twice but it seems he realized that wasn't funny anymore. It was a cute and funny movie. A step in the right direction for Sandler."

" An amazing movie
",0.5859,0.992,2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. It's a simple yet brilliant movie about how two very different families become a one. Adam Sandler (Jim Friedman) and Drew Barrymore (Lauren Reynolds) fell in love as they were both divorced parents and had children each their own. After a blind date, they hate each other, but somehow they cross paths every day and start liking each other. They both end up on vacation together, and that's when they start to realize that they love each other. It's a comedy romance movie, and the whole cast plays their roles amazingly. I have watched this movie so many times and yet I would watch it again and again because it's a great movie to relax and see that there can be blended families and that is okay, that is normal. Just adore this movie!"

" Really?
",0.0,0.8385,2019-04-07 00:00:00,1,I do genuinely like some of Sandler's films. But this is a new low. I'm convinced Sandler has it in his contract to only makes movies set in places he wants to vacation in. This is a by the numbers Sandler film and not in a good way. The premise of this movie is tenuous at best. Sandler feels like he's phoning in his performance and the jokes are really tired and lame. There is even a Steve Buscemi look a like in one scene probably because Steve read the script and did a hard pass. Terry Crews is the only bright spot in the film. Watch with your kids or if no kids don't even bother.
" It was ok
",0.296,-0.9485,2019-03-29 00:00:00,5,"This movie was very ok. It had it's characters then it had it's characters.
First the good, Espn (love the name though it's meant to be laughed at) is a character I enjoy because she's not the type to just forget about her dead mom and she's a character you end up loving and crying for. The boy Tyler has good character development too with him improving as a hitter. The movie had good drama. And Drew is still a great actress
Now the bad, it was supposed to have humor, but I think i laughed ONCE!!! And it was of course at something Espn did, MVP of the movie in my book. Shaq was dreadful here. He was really bad at fake crying and I joked that he should think about missing a game losing free throw in the last game of the NBA finals to teach him about crying. The older boy's whole character was not at funny, just creepy and finally Adam isn't funny either.So due to the drama and Espn's Character I give it a 5."

",0.5859,0.9963,2019-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I found this film relatively amusing, for an Adam Sandler film. Most of the time I cringe at his films but I thought that Adam and Drew Barrymore had a good on screen chemistry, their good at playing the visual slapstick, exaggeratedly over the top/hyper single parents. I'd heard this was quite good, the 2nd film to feature Adam and Drew as the two main leads since '50 First Dates' which I also thought wasn't too bad.Its an easy watch, pretty basic comedy as you might expect. The comedy is pretty zany and there's definitely a, as I say, hyperactive element to it. Its hardly greatly memorable but as an easy piece of cheap entertainment, its not awful. I thought it was surprisingly watchable and so I'm going for a 4 star rate, although I realise that it won't appeal to everyone. If you like the sound of this film and are ok with somewhat zany, exaggerated characters, a bit of cheese and basic visual comedy then I'd recommend this."

" Classic comedy pair
",0.3612,0.9835,2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Sandler and Barrymore often really work well together to make me laugh. They may be looked back on later as a classic pairing. Though there are plenty of comedies out there that lean too much on rude or stupid humor and some too much on various lowest common denominator jokes, this one did have a few great and witty things in it as well as a few genuine, nice moments. It is a great thing to be made to laugh. And even some of the sillier jokes struck just the right note with me. I'm thankful for good comedies."
" Funny

And you know how you tell them to go to their husband or dad and tell the joke to HIM and they mess it up when they do?That was this movie. Only it wasn't a joke but rather an entire Happy Madison movie script. I felt guilty and dumb for laughing at the few parts that were somewhat funny, and I wasn't even feeling the Sandler-Barrymore rom-com happiness, to boot. Everything about the movie was lazy and ""playing it safe""."

It's one of those awesome rom-come, about 2 single parents that went on a terrible first blind date and then somehow went on the same vacation from there friends and then it just turned out GREAT!!

" Great fun

" a different type of rom com
",0.0,0.969,2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows that love can happen over time especially when it comes to meeting and bonding with future step children. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. I found the cinematography to be absolutely beautiful and makes you feel like you are in an African vacation with the two families. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Really Good
",0.4927,0.9548,2018-09-10 00:00:00,8,This is my favourite film with Barrymore and Sandler together. I love the storyline and all the jokes. Terry Crews was an unexpected person to be in this film but his role was hilarious and made the film even better. I highly recommend this film if you like Rom-Com's.

I have watched all the movies and there is nothing else that makes me so happy and laughing in this life.Adam Sandler If a new movie comes out, even if it gets very bad points from the critics, it does not matter to me I love even the worst movie I love them very much All Adam Sandler movie are very nice to me.Adam Sandler movies, I have a sense of old comedy, so if you do it in a new movie, then you have a sense of comedies in those old movies.Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler a very good duo saw it in 50 first dates movies before.
I like this kind of stuff that is featured in this movie, which is tom character that is in 50 first dates movies in a place where I enjoy it in the movie.I liked it very much like watching my family almost 6-7 times and my family watched it more than once and still wants to watch more.

" Had the potential to be so good
",0.5777,0.8868,2018-06-05 00:00:00,4,"I'll give it to you straight. Adam Sandler and Drew Berrymore's acting is fine. They're always pretty great at their roles. However, my goodness, the writers truly ruined it. The best part about a film is the unraveling of the characters but the writers just added in unnecessary comments or things that really didn't need to be in there to show character development. It's the old saying from high school English class, ""show don't tell."" All they did was tell. So many words, not enough showing, and let me remind you this is a movie. On top of that the kids in the movie unfortunately couldn't act. It's a shame, with a better/more writers, a little revising from producing, and a different cast of kids, the film could have been a hit."
" Maybe Adam Sandlers best of the decade?
",0.6369,0.8198,2018-04-27 00:00:00,6,"I don't know why i still watch his movies. maybe in hopes that one is good for a change? in this case it is really is a good movie. not great but good. the only problem is that is doesn't offer anything new. its just your usual romantic comedy movie. Too bad Adam Sandler doesn't make more of those these days... 
If you like Adam Sandler movies go and watch it!"

I am a little bias because I've always love Adam Sandler (although Jack and Jill and That's my Boy were not great), but I still think I would love it anyway. It's funny, the setting is beautiful and it's heartwarming to the point that it actually made me cry a little. I highly recommend it!"
" Sandler Barrymore Fan
",0.3182,0.8294,2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Definitely worth the time to watch it. These two have done a few movies together and they always have good chemistry. Sure, it's formulaic. But, they're both seasoned actors, and able to be convincingly relatable. The usual Sandler suspects populate the cast, along with a few surprises. I watched this on HBO, and was interrupted a half hour into it. I decided to watch it all the way through, from the beginning, later in the night. Glad I did."
" Screw you guys, I like it!
",0.3382,0.8126,2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"What's wrong with the occasional feel- good movie? I think Adam Sandler shines when he's working with kids, and in these troubling times, I appreciate that he seems to be dedicated to making movies that have the general theme of ""just have fun being a decent person."" I respect him so much more now than I ever did during the SNL/Billy Madison/Happy Gilmore days."
" One of Adam Sandler's better films
",0.4404,0.8848,2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"I had never been much of an Adam Sandler film fan. Most of his earlier films seemed sophomoric and I didn't care for them. Blended, however, is pretty well done.There appears to be an on screen chemistry between Sandler and Drew Barrymore, although she has vehemently denied it. The story line, while humorous, has a romantic appeal to it. Two people who don't like each other at all, come together at the end with the help of their children.I was especially impressed with the performance by a young Bella Thorne. I hadn't seen her before."
" Another generic comedy we could have done without
",0.3612,-0.1703,2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"'Blended' is a generic, stale comedy that is almost identical to every other generic, stale comedy that Sandler has done. The plot might be different but it's still the same dumb humour and jokes that we've seen umpteen times before. You would have thought that an African safari trip would have made 'Blended' more appealing, but somehow it still manages to be totally uninspiring, verging on boring, despite the huge amount of potential with such a storyline. There are dumb jokes aplenty, most aren't funny, but they will probably keep the average viewer entertained.Unless you're Adam Sandler's biggest fan, there's little point watching 'Blended'. Generic comedies are everywhere you look at the moment, and this is one we could have all done without."

" Blended bogs down on tiresome rom-com formula with little to offer beyond a mediocre script
",0.0,0.9979,2017-02-22 00:00:00,4,"This romantic comedy reunites Adam Sandler with director Frank Coraci after their previous collaborations (The Wedding Singer, Click), and continues Sandler's endless series of schlocky comedies that have often ranged from mediocre to unbearable. Unlike most of Sandler's films from recent years, this one leans more towards the former category as it marks a slightly different direction than portraying Sandler as a phony man-child that has become his typical typecasting. That, however, doesn't mean this film is good. It is formulaic, it is rarely funny, and too often bogs down on the same dimwitted humor that tainted many of Sandler's previous entries. And when it comes to its more touching moments and tackling on family values, it occasionally works but does little to make up for how shallow this comedy is. This film stars Adam Sandler as Jim, a single father of three daughters: Hilary (played by Bella Thorne), Espn (played by Emma Fuhrmann), and Loud (played by Alyvia Alyn Lind). After a botched a blind date with a cute blondie named Lauren (played by Drew Barrymore), single mother of two sons Brendan and Tyler, Jim plans a family trip to South Africa in effort to bond with his children. Upon arriving however, he crashes into Lauren and her two son who happen to be vacationing there as well. With the two families forced to share a hotel room together against their will, a series of wild adventures ensues and an unexpected romance between Jim and Lauren slowly blossoms.Adam Sandler is no stranger to being subject to dumb, unengaging comedic vehicles that have tainted in his career in recent years. This film however, not only boasts surprisingly just a little bit more substance than the usual Sandler fare, but renders Sandler to someone with more likability to the immature man-child characters he's often seen playing. Collaborating with Drew Barrymore for the third time after 'The Wedding Singer' and '50 First Dates', Sandler manages to come up with a just a few okay laughs that sadly come far in between. But the film spends the majority of the time stuck in the shackles of tiresome slapstick humor and a redundant barrage of sexist jokes that either fail to land or just plain stale. At best, most of the dialogue that shoots out of the characters' mouths evoke nothing quick chuckles, if any. And it certainly does not help that the story is overly reliant on typical romantic comedy clich√©s to the point where it comes almost entirely predictable from start to finish. The best thing that manages to make its out is a surprisingly competent chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore which adds just a slight bit of energy to the story. And when the film is not trying unsuccessfully to throw a slew of flat jokes at you, there are a few attempts at more heart-touching moments with the girls coping with the absence of their late mother. At best, there is one dramatic scene towards the end that works somewhat well, the rest of the attempts come off as rather dull. By the end, it all transpires to a near two-hour runtime of unengaging, uninspiring comedic fare that left me checking my watch more often than laughing. Blended is derivative romantic comedy that too often bogs down on tiresome rom-com clich√©s and offers not enough wit or clever humor to qualify for a charming comedic vehicle. Although it may not plummet to the bottom of the barrel of Sandler's more unbearable comedies, it's still pretty forgettable and fails to provide a redeeming point to Sandler's career."

This movie reminded me exactly why it is that I love Adam Sandler and never lost faith in his movies. It was funny, cheesy, cute. Ignore the negative comments if you're a true Adam Sandler fan. The movie is SUPPOSED to be cheesy and corny. That's what Adam Sandler is all about: the dumb humor. The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler was just as it was in 51st dates. Everything from the cheesy lines to the over-the-top accidents, this movie made me literally laugh out loud.Not to mention, Terry Crews is HILARIOUS!!b Definitely watching again."
