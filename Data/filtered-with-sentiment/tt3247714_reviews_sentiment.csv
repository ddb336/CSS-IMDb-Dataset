" If you do Like heroes. Do not watch this movie.
",0.7003,0.9749,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"A good plot. Same for all the actors.Of course if you see this kind of movie you can expect some actions that would be in reality probably not possible to pull of.This comes with a hero's movie. If 9/11 did not happen and the movie was made, no one would believe that it would possible.It is more unlikely that a number of suÃ¯cide take flight lessons and orchestrate a plot like 9/11, than the script of this movie.James Bond is over the top for me but this is with a little artistic freedom but possible with a little imagination.It is just fun to watch is you like a good movie just for amusement."

Sadly, the language at times is very poor including blasphemy frequently. This house isnt likely to watch again, but if youre one of those not concerned about such things then this is quite different given that the hero is female who spends most of the time running. The ending is equally quite different and perhaps not one you might expect if you do watch to the end."

Jovovich is running from both British and American agents, but can't be bothered to make any attempt to hide her identity. Please. Find a hat! Bassett, as the American ambassador is in a big hurry to turn the Jovovich character over to the British. Other than these annoyances, the plot is hackneyed and offers no surprises."

" Three Days of the Condor Redux
",0.0,0.8753,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"""Survivor"" updates ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Milla Jovovich in the Robert Redford role, Pierce Brosnan in the Max Von Sydow role, the cleverly blackmailed Robert Forster in the bad boss Michael Kane role, Angela Bassett in the John Houseman role, the wheelchaired Frances de la Tour in the wheelchaired Jess Osuna role, and so on and so forth. Dylan McDermott is kind of a mix of ""Condor's"" Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunaway roles (even though the final film knowingly or not suggests Jovovich is lesbian). This time terrorism - or the appearance of terrorism - drives the plot, much as it does in the first half of the 2006 James Bond Film ""Casino Royale."" Oblique references are made to 9-11, even showing a brief clip of the first plane flying into the Twin Towers, where Cliff Robertson had an office in ""Condor."" Jovovich's (odd) attraction to the ""underground"" - and her stalking through the literal Underground - also draws comparisons to ""The Third Man."" That said, the too generically titled ""Survivor"" is a fun, if rather convoluted little romp. The film's unlikely scenario is compelling enough, with Jovovich and Brosnan (in an always fun-to-watch opposite James Bond mode) playing an entertaining game of cat and mouse, and it's refreshing to see a woman hold her own in this sort of film without resorting to over-the-top he-man heroics or cocky quips, but...it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Important plot points were left on the cutting-room floor for some reason. And while it's plausible to keep the audience guessing who is good and who is bad in all of this, it's hard to figure out in the end which way the always magnetic James D'arcy and the criminally under-used Angela Bassett swing. Still, it's fun and mostly intelligent, if not a wee bit derivative and unbelievable. It ain't as serious as the final title card implies. But it's fun if you can figure out what's going on."
" Wasted Talent

" Derivative, but very Serviceable Actioneer!
",0.0,0.9761,2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting a huge amount from a movie with a 28 Metascore and a 5.6 IMDB rating. But as far as I'm concerned James McTeigue's Survivor is a lot better film than those scores would indicate. It's not particularly original mind you, but I enjoyed this (essentially) chase tale where a US London Embassy Foreign Service officer seeks to both clear her name for an apparent terrorist bombing and uncover a conspiracy involving embassy staff. All of this occurring whilst she is being pursued by a dangerous assassin.Survivor was neither a critical nor commercial success, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. It's not a huge budget film by any means, but it boasts good production values and slick direction from McTeigue. Milla Jovovich, whilst shown to be resourceful and smart definitely doesn't play some kind of female Bourne/or Jennifer Salt type super agent. In most of her scenes she relies on her brains, assistance from her few allies or just dumb luck to evade her pursuers. Pierce Brosnan also playing against type to a degree, seems to be enjoying himself in his role as the icy-hearted, skilled assassin. They both have some very experienced support on hand in luminaries such as Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and Dylan McDermott.Can I just say here that much has been made in many of the reviews about the unrealistic storyline/plot holes. I think it's only fair to add at this juncture without spoiling, that a great deal of this criticism is both unfounded and just plain incorrect. Many of those criticising just haven't followed the storyline closely enough and have got really basic stuff (such as completely confusing characters, locations and forgetting events such as the prologue.) wrong. It is quite frustrating, when you know an albeit ""B"" grade action vehicle has clearly had some decent script overseeing and editing to ensure a pretty fair degree of realism given the genre, only to find heaps of punters don't really pick up on it. But just to mention a couple of really obvious things that I see being raised frequently. The c/c cameras at the explosion site are all blown out. We see evidence and it's mentioned. Why does Nash trigger a messy explosion instead of a clean kill attempt on Abbott? You have to think back to the prologue. The Taliban are blackmailing an influential figure and they want to strike at the USA. Nash is literally expecting to kill 2 lots of birds with one stone (bang). Issues such as diplomatic immunity are addressed, although later in the film the ambassador issues an ""off the record"" statement to the London metropolitan police. There are plenty of other examples. But like I said, Survivor given its genre and market has a pretty reasonable amount of narrative integrity.By all means if you're looking for a half-way decent action vehicle, that has a consistently good pace, decent storyline and doesn't overstay its welcome (96 minutes) look in on and see what makes Kate Abbott the Survivor."
" Could have been better
",0.4404,-0.1973,2019-11-04 00:00:00,4,Scenario is good but acting of the Milla (Kate) is debatable. Plus some points in the scenario doesn't make sense. The way it has been portrayed is not realistic. How can she just do everything alone? Fight with assassins herself? Win over one of the most dangerous assassins in the world ? That is not credible. She is not a spy or an agent. She is just a security officer. That's why it doesn't make sense.
" Milla doesn't reach all the way
",-0.0191,0.7274,2019-10-13 00:00:00,5,It really had potential but they hurry through the movie. It doesn't feel authentic. Mcdermott is excellent as well as Brosnan. But it doesn't help!
" All the stupid choices in one place
",-0.5267,0.0772,2019-08-27 00:00:00,2,"Just another cliche action flick where characters will make most illogical, unrealistic choices just to fit the thin plot so there could be an hour-and-something of stuff going on..Without spoiling the movie, it literally makes no sense, whatsoever, that main character does things she does.This is one of those movies the actors do during their downtime, cuz bills gotta be paid..Save yourself some braincells and skip this one."
" Solid plot, fair acting, kind of boring
",0.079,-0.8661,2019-08-27 00:00:00,6,"All of the pieces are here, good actors, solid plot, but it just falls short. The main character Kate spends most of the movie just wandering around whimpering, avoiding the bad guys, then all the sudden in the last five minutes kicks ass. The characters lack depth, you learn back ground info but doesn't explore any further than just offhanded mentioning. It really could have been something if they could have made the main character more effective and the characters more emotionally involved with each other and the story."
" A Nice First Time Experience, But Not Worth Multiple Viewings
",-0.0256,0.9831,2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,"A spy movie that has the star talent and the great concept but the screenwriter really lets down the intelligence and action in this movie upon an ""initial"" experience. However as portrayed as a security analyst, Milla Jokovich and her script do a great justice upon further reflection. This espionage movie becomes a sort of an ascent to more authentic and less over the top dramatics. Yet even a further review notes that even though Pierce Brosnan as a bad guy does a cuttingly edgy portrayal, Milla's character cannot be considered the best of the best by the scriptwriter's weak behavior and muddled thinking at times. While a nice first time look because of the movie's intrigue and intensity, the lack of the more subtle intelligence overall seems to degrade the movie."
" my notes

" Pretty decent and enjoyable movie
",0.7269,0.8489,2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Reading thru the reviews, I was surprised at how many were so harsh and negative. Survivor is not the best action/thriller movie, but it certainly isn't the worst. I enjoyed the A-list actors like McDermott, Brosnan and Milla.It has a decent plot with a few issues- for example, why Abbott didn't try to disguise herself when she was on the run, why the ""world's best assassin"" can't seem to kill Abbott (a very common issue in many of these types of movies) etc. ... but it was complicated and twisty enough that you need to pay attention. Some parts are fairly fast paced, the dialogue is sometimes hard to hear, some of the characters resemble each other such that if you aren't paying attention, you can miss some of the plot points. Maybe that's why some of the negative reviewers didn't like the movie- they couldn't follow it.This is an enjoyable action movie that is worth the time and if you have Netflix like we do, it doesn't cost anything."
" Good spy thriller inspired by SALT !
",0.7777,0.9897,2019-04-17 00:00:00,8,"It is surprisingly a good movie. A action packed spy thriller starts to finish watchable. Seems like inspired by 'Salt', Angelina Jolly starrer. Good performance by Milla Jovovich in Kate. We can see whole corrupt security department of Government where no one has right to ask anything about suspected activities of their superiors. Pierce Bronson is also perfect in sniper cum bomber' role. Post after his image of 007 he is doing well recently in various character roles like villain, father, gangster etc. With his presence on screen our interest in the movie is highly rising. He is a most plus point in here movie. Dylan McDermott (Sam) is another remarkable actor here. Although it is thriller movie has some flaws too, that after a heavy bombing and lot of gunning, Kate does not get hurt much, whereas her superior Sam gets down almost dead. When the whole system is corrupt then who is trustable and how to stop an terrorist's attack on New York on the eve of New Year while all police squads are chasing you. This is best part of the story, however second half is a little bit less interesting. Anyway this is must watchable to thriller and spy movie lovers."
" action fans will like it
",0.3612,-0.5823,2019-02-12 00:00:00,5,"It's safe to say that James McTeigue's ""Survivor"" got made with action fans in mind. Anyone who prefers anything more highbrow than ""Die Hard"" won't like it. Typical stuff that we've seen in Milla Jovovich's movies. Completely over-the-top."
" Goofy but watchable
",0.0,0.8422,2019-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Not all that bad. Pierce Brosnan is always good and Milla Jovovich is just plain good to look at. Made me want to watch ""The Fifth Element"" again.Action is non-stop, if not always sensible. Every reviewer seems to have noted that although Jovovich knows she is on London security cameras, has been photographed on dozens of bystander cell-phones, has had her picture sent to every news outlet and law officer on two continents, she never even so much as puts on a hoodie or wig. You have to wonder what the director was thinking.The overall story has been done many times, going back (at least) to Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 classic ""The 39 Steps"". Still, lots of action, lots of tension, very watchable."
" Wasted opportunity - annoying writing
",-0.4767,0.7842,2019-01-27 00:00:00,5,"Acting is decent, cast is stellar (expensive) and the director has a very strong pedigree with the excellent V for vendetta. It's an interesting movie to watch and trying to figure out why this is not a solid thrilling movie. What took me out of the story were a couple of unrealistic exchanges. Characters acting unbelievable och stupid. It feel like this movie is fixable. Deleting 10 minutes and reshooting, rewriting and it might stick together. Prehaps."
" Do not waste your time on this movie.
",0.3252,0.8558,2019-01-17 00:00:00,1,"When I read about this movie I thought of Mila Jovovich as the 5. Element and Pierce Brosnan in ""Mars attacks"".So it shouldn't be too bad. Man was I disappointed! I couldn't believe, that Brosnan was trying to save this movie with his rather good acting. But this doesn't save the film from being completely unbelievable and utterly disappointing.
Sit on a park bench and feed the pigeons for 90 minutes. It will be far more interesting."
" Good Concept, Good Stars, Good Dramatic Script
",0.8271,0.9973,2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"4 June 2015. For a while this espionage flick had great promise and the set up had all the makings of a classic spy movie, but it sputters out because of the eventual lazy scriptwriting. Milla Jokovich deserved a lot better intelligent action character and she has the moves as seen in one of her bad ass classic characters in The Fifth Element (1997) as Leeloo, a name the Bruce Willis has to come up with because her real character name was so difficult to pronounce and nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. For an action actress who can star in five Resident Evil (2002) movies, somebody must think that she has some moves that the audience appreciations. As such, her character is vastly underused in the action department. Instead this movie seems like a pale comparison to Julia Roberts thrilling The Pelican Brief (1993). Even Pierce Brosnan's evil character doesn't get to really shine because his prey isn't given enough to show off her ""top asset"" credentials.Milla Jokovich for a top security agent doesn't have much in the way of hiding herself well and the ending climax seems pretty lame considering. Enemy of the State (1998) is the model from which the writer, Philip Shelby for Survivor could have learned a lot from, 18 years earlier. The concept for the movie is fascinating, the stars had the talent, even the directorial effort seemed adequate, it was the writing that really let everybody down.9/7/15 Update. It doesn't happen often, but this movie continues to evolve in its portrayal as an espionage thriller. Taking out the action scenes and replacing them with the nature of Milla Jokovich as a top security agent instead of a top operative, this scripted dialogue begins to make much more sense. The expectation and necessity for over the top action and dramatic thrills is perhaps a tainted expectation of what a great movie must incorporate. This movie while it doesn't play like the cerebral, methodical thriller The Russian House (1990), has more comparison to Clooney's The American (2010) or the more subdued The Assassin's Bullet (2012) or The Tailor of Panama (2010) where Brosnan portrayed a more sympathetic operative. Taken from a dramatic thriller not an action thriller standpoint, this movie is much better than it has been rated."

When fellow embassy workers perish in an explosion caused by deadly assassin known as the Watchmaker (Pierce Brosnan.)Kate finds herself as a suspect and is on the run with the police and the Watchmaker after her.The film has a fine cast that includes Angela Bassett, Dylan McDermott, Robert Forster but they are all wasted in this generic but stupid thriller.Kate gets captured on a smartphone when the Forster character dies but nobody is filming when the Watchmaker goes to the body and takes something from him.Sadly this was Roger Rees last movie and maybe he deserved a better send off."

",0.0516,0.766,2018-07-10 00:00:00,6,"A good cast, a taut plot and some fun action scenes makes this a likable enough spy thriller. Unfortunately, this entire plot has been done many times before. The single bureaucrat who discovers a plot only to be framed and have to go on the run, has been done to death. Pierce Brosnan and Milla Jovovich are game enough and almost lift this little thriller above the fray.Jovovich is Kate Abbot, an American security employee working in the London embassy approving passports. She stumbles on to several questionable application approvals and is told to ""leave it alone"" by her superior, Bill (Robert Forster). When all of her fellow visa co-workers are killed during a bomb blast at a local restaurant, Kate manages to survive by luck. She then runs into Brosnan's hitman, The Watchmaker, who tries to kill her. She goes on the run and circumstances make it appear she is involved. She then has to clear her name and uncover the next terrorist attack.Its pretty standard fare, but the two leads elevate it. Seeing Brosnan as a villain is refreshing after his stint as Bond. Jovovich does a nice job as the innocent office worker forced into extraordinary circumstances. Dylan McDermott is a bright spot as the head of Kate's department. Angela Basset appears as the American Ambassador and does one dimensional stuff like yell at everyone to ""clean this up."" Her career has really gone down the tubes.The plot has some serious holes blown in it (haha, see what I did there?). Brosnan's Watchmaker is supposed to be an expert assassin, but he can't shoot straight in the chase scenes to save his life. If you can ignore how incompetent the London police are and the almost unbelievable way Kate manages to extricate herself from different situations, its a fun ride. Just don't think about what is happening too hard."
" Big plot hole spoilt the movie.
",0.0,-0.3071,2018-07-07 00:00:00,1,"Sat down to watch this last night. Was going along with it right up to about half an hour where bail bond man from Jackie Brown, Oscar winner, gets himself shot in the stomach in a park. The people in the park hear all this, sees him with blood coming out all over the place, very slowly stagger over to the boating lake. And there's multi-pass standing there with a gun in hand. 
We are supposed to believe people are just going to stand around taking pics with their phones, just gawping, looking at multi-pass holding her gun after some bloke has been shot. NEVER in a million years, what an insult to your intelligence. At that point, that was the END of the movie for me. 
Even old folk in that park would have bolted off as fast as they could, contents of shopping bags spilling out in their frantic attempt to avoid being shot. Too many of these movies have these unrealistic scenes, like someone getting stabbed or shot on a subway train and instead of the rest of the occupants getting out the connecting carriages as fast as they can, which they would do, they just sit there with daft looks on their faces as if nothing much has happened. Seen that too many times.
Your intelligence will only be a 'survivor' if you give this a miss or give up on it part way through, it's ok to give up on movies & TV series when they insult your intelligence with these 'as if' scenes. Too many 'as if's' or one big one and the show is ruined for me."

When she comes across a suspicious request, she delays a VISA. This delayed VISA means she must be eliminated. An assassin known as the Watchmaker (Pierce Brosnan) is being paid big bucks to do the task.The film was a big cat and mouse chase with everyone after Kate Abbott. While she makes the film as exciting as possible, she is no Jason Bourne. I would have liked to seen the roles reversed with Pierce as the good guy and Mila as the assassin dressed in black leather and spiked heels. It wouldn't be as real, but a bit more entertaining for us simple folk.The theme of the film is that law enforcement have been ""doing their job"" behind the scenes to prevent attacks, that we don't know anything about.

" Not Unworthy Of Your Time
",0.357,0.9848,2018-01-22 00:00:00,6,"It is certainly not as bad as the ratings and majority of the reviews suggest. Yes, there are lots of plot holes to find, but I believe a movie should be judged by its entertainment quotient rather than its bullet-proof plot. This one keeps you interested. Brosnan, I felt, was pretty sharp in his role as the assassin and Mila does what she does best, run for cover and retaliate. As I always keep stating, a movie is half as good as its climax, this one though left much to be desired on that front, pretty low key to say the least. I go with a 6/10 for this one."

Directed by James McTeigue and written by Phillip ShelbyHere we have a misguided terrorism thriller starring an evil Pierce Brosnan rarely speaking and viciously killing people. Milla Jovovich works for the embassy that checks applications for visas. She stumbles upon a conspiracy and a world class assassin with a supervillain code name is sent after her to shut her down. From that description alone, you know exactly what is going to happen. It follows down this path and you can predict everything. I'm okay with them using 9/11 as inspiration for why this woman does what she does. It does for a brief moment show the twin towers and it brings you out of the movie a moment. It's not Christmas in Mississippi bad but it is pretty close. It does not stay long and the movie moves right along. This is one of those watch and immediately forget movies. From the director of V For Vendetta and The Raven, this is a mess in comparsion to what he's done before. It also makes one suspicious that maybe these other movies he directed had a different person guiding it throughout. This movie is so flat and so generic, you almost wish Milla would do yet another Resident Evil movie. I can't recommend the movie but it is easily the best of the bunch so far. Not exactly high praise. This is a bland and just dull film. I give this movie a D."

An female Agent of Homeland security is sent to London to make sure no bad terrorists get a visa to the US (which is anyhow strange, since European citizens do not Need a visa to get to the US).Within the plot, Milla Jovovich who Plays the super hero gets twice blasted by explosions which devastate the environment around her. But she is not hurt and can continue to super-hero. Every other second someone misses her by Shooting at her. She beats up guys badly, takes their guns from them and shoots them. I think it is a fine Play for women-rights activists. I - personally - was attempted to leave after an hour. I should have done it.Thanks. But no thanks."
" middling thriller
",0.1027,-0.8686,2017-10-17 00:00:00,4,"An American military helicopter pilot is taken by insurgents in Afganistan. Kate Abbott (Milla Jovovich) is a newly arrived State Department security officer at the American embassy in London under Sam Parker (Dylan McDermott). Kate investigates Emil Balan (Roger Rees) applying for a visitor visa. Her co-workers are killed in a bombing by the Watchmaker (Pierce Brosnan) and she barely escapes his gunsight. It's a conspiracy with supervisor Bill Talbot (Robert Forster) and the terrorists. Paul Anderson (James D'Arcy) is a British security officer.This is a middling thriller. The problem is that everything is thrown at her to make her look guilty. Each evidence is questionable and filled with conveniences. Security cameras go down in one of the most surveilled cities in the world. There is basic investigative work that these experts miss out on. It's also questionable why Emil needs to go to America or if he could have supervised from London or how he got another passport anyways. Every character does some questionable action or fails to act. The actors are fine and the production is functional. The writing is simply not sharp enough. Idiocy by some of these characters taint any hope for a good thriller. In the age of terrorism fears, Kate would not be dismissed so easily even if suspicions start falling on her. Emil would be a person of interest from the beginning in the real world but the movie brushes him off with contrivances. At a certain point, I assumed half of these characters are in a conspiracy because otherwise would mean that they are written stupidly. The new year's eve time square scenario is unrealistic and Kate is only successful due to happenstance. It's poorly written."
" Survivor
",0.3612,-0.9919,2017-09-30 00:00:00,4,"I saw the poster for this film and was mainly interested because of the actor and actress starring, I knew it had low ratings by critics, but I was still up for giving it a go, directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, The Raven). Basically in London, Diplomatic Security Service agent Katherine ""Kate"" Abbott (Milla Jovovich) works for the American Embassy in London, she started working working for the government following the deaths of many of her friends in 9/11. While she is investigating visa applications for potential terrorist suspects, her team are celebrating the birthday of their superior Bill Talbot (Robert Forster) with a restaurant party, most of them are killed by terrorists. Bill is not present at the party during the explosion, he is being blackmailed under the threat of his son Johnny (Paddy Wallace), an American soldier serving in Afghanistan, he tries to delete records of visas he has approved for terrorists entering the United States. Kate survived the bombing going into a store for a last-minute birthday present, an investigation reveals the bomb has traces of chromium, agent Sam Parker (Dylan McDermott) deduces that the perpetrator, who has used similar methods, with precision for his work, is one of the most wanted killers, he is known as ""The Watchmaker"" (Pierce Brosnan). Kate's subsequent attempts to find out the cause of the explosion lead her to find out that Bill was being blackmailed, she also concludes that the attack was indeed the work of the Watchmaker, her efforts uncover a plan to detonate a bomb at Times Square in New York City during the New Year's Eve celebrations. While continuing her own investigating, Bill attacks Kate, she unintentionally kills him in self-defence, through witness statements and video footage, Kate is classified a suspect for the attacks, she is now being hunted. Kate is forced to avoid sightings and get false passports to travel to passport, she is helped by Sam and her analyst friend Sally (Frances de la Tour), the only two people who believe her innocence. Meanwhile the Watchmaker uses a sniper rifle to fire an incendiary round into a sphere filled with explosive gas atop a vacant block of apartments in Tower Hamlets, the same as will be used in Times Square, the building is destroyed. The Watchmaker reveals later that he knows his client's purpose for the Times Square attack is not terrorism, it is for financial gain, he will bet against the stock market and make millions when the stock market reopens, the Watchmaker demands half the profits and threatens to cancel the attack, the client agrees. Dr Emil Balan (Roger Rees) coordinates filling the New Year's Eve ball with explosive gas, he wants revenge for the death of his wife who did not get her visa to the U.S. and died without medical treatment. Balan meets with the Watchmaker on top of a high rise a few blocks from Times Square, there the Watchmaker will shoot the sphere and ignite the gas, the Watchmaker kills Balan to remove any connection back to him. Kate arrives in Times Square, having deduced the plot, she finds the Watchmaker moments before he can trigger the bomb explosion, they fight and she throws the Watchmaker off the side of the building, he falls to his death on the stroke of midnight. Kate has her name cleared when her suspicion of Balan is vindicated, and she is called by Sam, who survived recent injuries, he congratulates her for saving many lives. Also starring Angela Bassett as Maureen Crane, Parker Sawyers as Ray, Sean Teale as Alvin Murdock, James D'Arcy as Paul Anderson and Corey Johnson as Eric Loomis. Jovovich is fairly good as the female agent forced to go on the run, prove her innocence and stop a terrorist plot, and Brosnan usually plays heroes, so it is good to see him with few lines being a nasty assassin. The story is a bit predictable, the script is a bit clunky, and it is a little bit long, it feels like something you've seen before (a Enemy of the State sort of thing), but it does engage you with some close call moments, gunfire and chases, an alright action thriller. Okay!"
" Suspend all logic before watching.
",-0.3182,-0.9941,2017-09-24 00:00:00,6,"A reasonable film, but not full of action, and you have to suspend belief that Kate (Milla) could overpower a fit attacker that surprises her from behind, never mind an aged looking Pierce Brosnan who plays the most incompetent assassin ever seen on the screen, missing killing his target on a number of occasions. The nice point of the film is that it isn't one of these Earth destroying everyone at risk film, just the killing of people at the New York New Year celebrations. Maybe a lot of people, but at least not an over the top, unbelievable scenario. Good for a wet Sunday (unfortunately I watched it on a hot Sunday, but you cannot plan these things). *** Spoilers *** Now for the Spoilers Now I'll mention the Spoilers bit which ruined the film for me because the writers did not truly understand security protocol. When Bill deletes the 5 people that are suspicious, he is supposed to use Kate's details. However any worthwhile secure system will record not just the operator but the time, date and user terminal. As Kate had left the building this would also have been recorded and so she would not be under any suspicion. When Kate accidentally shoots a man in a struggle, she is blamed for the death, but GSR (Gun Shoot Residue) would have been on the assailants hands and again she would not be under suspicion, in fact the Police are more likely want to put her in protective custody. Finally you have an assassin who gets a bomb into a restaurant (and it looks like it is with help of the staff), then detonates it without checking the intended target is even in the building. Seriously?"
" This is the worse action movie I have ever seen with an all star cast..
",-0.4767,0.535,2017-07-14 00:00:00,2,"The only redeeming feature of this movie is Milla. I bought this movie because she and Pierce Brosnan are on the cover. It also listed Robert Forster (JACKIE BROWN), Angela Bassett, Roger Rees, and Dylan McDermott. I told myself that this has to be a good movie. Well, it is not, because the plot has holes in it that detract from watching the movie. Milla plays an embassy security agent that just got in from New York that is so bad ass that the marine snipers on the roof of the embassy know who she is. She is that hot shot security agent that broke up a terrorist attack in the US. If this is the case, why is she assigned to checking visa applications? The plot is so convoluted that it quickly becomes more and more unbelievable. At a certain point, when she has everyone against her and she infiltrates her way back into the embassy, the person I watch IMDb 250 movies with, demanded that we turn this movie off. He is a Milla Jojovich and Robert Forester fan, but Robert Forester had since exited the film and Milla cannot carry a bad movie all by herself, unless it is a Resident Evil movie. I love Angela Bassett, but the script called for her to play a character that I grew to dislike and hate. All of the characters, I grew to hate, except Milla, but again she could not carry this movie by herself.The plot line involves the use of a weapon that is tested in London, which causes huge destruction. The people take that weapon and smuggle it to the US. In the mean time, the US embassy believes that Milla is the person driving events forward. HOW THE HECK DOES AN EMBASSY SECURITY AGENT assemble and transport a weapon to the US, then set it up for detonation. Then she makes it from London to New York with everyone looking for her, and some how stumbles upon the location of the bomb and foils the plan -- unbelievable. It is more unbelievable that she is not just shot dead by the US anti-terror units. The ending is so contrived and I can only shake my head at how bad it is. How did Milla figure it all out?I went back and finished the movie and looked at the special features on the disk. I found out things, like this movie script has been floating around since the 1970s, which makes all of the sense in the world. No one wanted to finance this disaster -- until now. And the first actress that they asked to consider this roll turned them down, which brought in Milla. If I thought that the movie could not get any worse, I looked at the deleted scenes and I discovered, it could have been. The deleted scenes make for an even worse interpretation of the background, like what the real motivation for the McDermott character's belief structure, which was pure lust, not professional respect.The way the movie ends, the true evil character has not been addressed at all and for all you know is out there, ready to try it all again. In the cut scene, there is an unexplained helicopter that takes him out with a hell fire missile, along with his chauffeur and body guard as he is being driven over a bridge in London. London must have a high tolerance for bomb destruction."
" Cookie cutter filmmaking at its most blatant
",0.0,0.9719,2017-06-20 00:00:00,5,"SURVIVOR is a cookie-cutter modern-day thriller featuring non-actress Milla Jovovich in the lead role of a government worker who gets accused of crimes she didn't commit and who is subsequently forced to go on the run to clear her name. It's a story we've seen play out time and again in the likes of THE BOURNE IDENTITY and SALT, and indeed there's absolutely nothing new in the way of material here.Jovovich is one of my least favourite actresses, but at least she doesn't have time to emote here - she's too busy running around. The film's best element is Pierce Brosnan, cast against type as a cold-hearted assassin, and very good he is in the role too. Budget-wise, this is a middling story, with a number of CGI explosions and the like to keep it going, and some mildly suspenseful chase sequences which aren't too bad. It's not the type of film to set the world on fire, but if you're looking for something easy it might just do the job."
" Another Eloi drama-porn fantasy
",0.0,-0.9592,2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"Stop. Stop the DVD. Stop the stream. Stop the torrent. There is nothing worth watching here other than a waste of acting talent. Instead watch The Shallows. I was lucky enough to have that DVD from the library as well, even though I did not know enough to turn off this crap until after I watched it. Now you know. Spare yourself.There must be a completely clueless elite that produces, writes, and directs atrocities like this. They have no connection to any human behaviors not involving limos and Dom Perignon. They watch other movies and see them succeed. So they make cargo-cult monstrosities like this, aping things like chases and explosion but without understanding. The characters don't behave in any believable way. The ""technical"" aspects like soldering a blob on a sim card to make a bomb are laugh-out-loud pathetic. Get any tech adviser from his mom's basement and he can come up with something more believable.Some specific objections. It takes an hour to learn what the opening scene in Afghanistan had to do with anything. An ambassador that can order extra-judicial killings in her host country. A high-level chosen-child striver security analysis that has to work the counter. You mind as well make her a heroic DMV clerk. Milla making noises when she is chased that alternate between Frank Zappa's ""ice pick in the forehead"" and the noises women tennis players make when they hit the ball. We all want to have sex with the nice Croatian girl, but she shouldn't make those noises when she is running for her life. Simple labored breathing would be fine, and probably a lot sexier. About five nondescript middle-aged white guys (NM-AWGs) that I could not tell apart even by the end of the movie. I don't know if the director has a crush on this facial type, but maybe he could cast a few redheads and beards and heaven-forbid, black and brown people. A few more gals might help too. Or just eliminate half the characters.The writer, director, and producer must be some Eloi-class elites that don't know anything about people or things. Maybe they just forgot, we all get old.A lot might have been saved in the editing bay. Open with the art gallery scene, but the owner friend is a guy. There are more straight people than lesbians, sorry, its simple demographics. Then some work boredom. Then the fantastic restaurant explosion. Lose the Afghanistan scene completely. We know there are sociopaths out there, don't remind us when we go to a movie. Also lose the whole McGuffin gas bomb thing. That means all the high-tech gibberish too. Terrorists are stupid savage people. They would use a fertilizer bomb in some unexpected vehicle to kill everybody. Maybe make it a CNN truck so if it blows up or not, its a win/win. Have her save the crowd from that.I was so delighted when a NM-AWG wondered where she would go after the bomb and another NM-AWG said ""she will follow Embassy protocol."" Gosh where they could have gone from there. Milla pulls out a bus locker key, perhaps from her sweet Croatian vagina. At the locker she gets $20,000, a gun, a passport, and a burner phone. She calls in and now all the good guys know she is on their side. The suspense is having her come in, without getting killed. She would have to have some special info, maybe the after-plastic-surgery appearance of the bad guy. But she gets foiled over and over. So she decides to fly to New York and stop the madman herself, despite just being a mild-mannered albeit sexy DMV clerk.The bones are all there, its just in the arrangement and details that this movie fails so miserably. There was one benefit in watching this dreadful mess. When I did plug in The Shallows, 20 minutes in I got a lump in my throat and jumped up and shouted, ""Look everybody, a plot!"""
" Completely mindless

The story makes no sense, and the movie would probably have been 5 times better if they just started with the restaurant scene and removed everything but the action scenes. It's already mindless, but at least that way it wouldn't have been insulting to the point of ruining immersion. None of the characters behave like human beings and every other scene made me wonder why would they ever do that. Terrible writing makes it a waste of what should have been a pretty good cast."
