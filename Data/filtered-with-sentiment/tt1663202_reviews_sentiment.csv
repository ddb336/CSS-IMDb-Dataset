" This is the new standard for film as a medium
",0.0,0.9716,2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"In a word, the revenant is special. It's a once in a lifetime movie which left me gasping for air and with moisture in my eyes, and I only appreciated it more on the second viewing. It's visual beauty is unrivalled yet the hidden emotional depth of the film, it's story and its characters is even more beautiful and chillingly touching than the cinematography and mindblowingly gorgeous landscapes. This is something I feel that most critics have missed out on, the ability of this film to show all facets of the human condition and how it leaves you feeling both cold and satisfied, it is not simply a survival tale. I'll finish by mentioning that Tom Hardy especially and of course DiCaprio as well give some of the best performances I've ever seen, they're so fleshed out and reflective of people at the time mixed with what the harshness of nature does to us, but you still understand them completely and become fond of their resilience and determination."
" Great photography... and that's all
",0.6249,-0.7325,2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"It's without a doubt that the cinematography in this film is a masterpiece, one of the best anamorphic experiences out there. From there on the problems begin: the directing is extremely slow-paced. The story itself does seem to include some interesting features, but at least in the way it is presented it ends up as another conventional, uninspiring and pointlessly long script. The characters are hollow, so what we end up watching is some people we don't care about doing stuff we don't care about. It honestly disappoints me to see DiCaprio walk around in pain for two and a half hours, which of course he does really well, but it really feels like a waste. Overall, it is no more than a pricey cinematography reel"

It made me feel very tense and I kept wondering where the sunshine was. This movie is so depressing and sad. It is truly stressful to watch. And it has really gross things and the actors talk about things that are too disturbing. No thank you!
" Raw Reality of the Past Illuminates the Conflict of the Present
",-0.3182,-0.6428,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film at a time when the extraordinary political climate of the US seemed incomprehensible to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, and at a time with the Covid Pandemic was at its height.The sheer raw, brutality of the reality depicted in this narrative, has illuminated to me the true nature of the frontier spirit which inhabited those early pioneers who lived in such a harsh, uncompromising and competitive world. But this spirit is still evident in the rebellion of those who fight against Covid restrictions, who believe that to be weak is to have failed, that life is about the ""survival of the fittest"". This spirit seems to me to have evolved from that drive which enabled the early settlers to survive.The cinematography is, of course, magnificent - cold, grey, bleak, as cold, grey and bleak as the story."
" A Really Intense Experience
",0.1513,0.9967,2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"What an epic film. Iñárritu truly is a master filmmaker, and his direction paired with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography makes this a joy to look at. I think the final hour of this film is genuinely phenomenal, because at that point the story becomes more focused and the characters are developed enough for me to really care what is going on. The first hour and a half or so wasn't as engaging, but the filmmaking on display was still phenomenal. Whilst I do think the film would be better at 2hrs 15-20mins, it was still a great, great film. Leonardo is obviously phenomenal. Whilst I wouldn't necessarily call this his best performances, it's certainly his most committed role, and he definitely did deserve the Oscar. I think my favourite fact about this film is that it was shot entirely using natural light - it helps to capture the realism that Iñárritu wanted and helps with the visuals. Again, I do think it could have been a bit better story-wise in the first 90 or so minutes, but it is still a great film that I'd definitely recommend."
" A true masterpiece
",0.7845,0.9201,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I watched this in hdr on my big screen tv. Another awesome movie by the great magician DiCaprio. Without spoiling it for those that haven't seen it yet, the bear fight is unbelievable, like nothing I've ever seen before, with all the gore and movie magic, I will take extra care and stay away from bears although we have none in Australia."
" Beautiful and unwatchable at the same time
",0.5994,0.8279,2021-02-17 00:00:00,5,"If Revenant has taught me one thing, it's not the power of resilience or the relative lameness of bears. It's that I don't have the emotional availability to get invested in men's tall tales about how tough they were. This goes for both the story itself and the meta-story of the making of this movie.The story itself is based on a true story but I suppose in the same way that Lord of the Rings is. Glass would be dead by the bear quite soon in real life, and if not for many many of the reasons further down the road not least of which taking a long dip in a mountain river during winter.Some aspects do remind me a lot of Karl May's books about the wild west. The protagonists qualify as ""greenhorns"" at best, with little knowledge of the dynamics of Native tribes. They're in over their heads in a deadly situation and realistically you do expect all of them to die. Glass's survival is in the realm of magical feats by unlikely heroes.Having established this, then, the movie is a fiction amounting to a tall tale about how tough these guys were out there in the wild. Which definitely calls back to all the accounts of how hard this movie was to work on following the director's ridiculously pretentious requirements. I suppose this will happen when one starts to believe they are larger than life.The cinematography is unbelievably beautiful and the actors do a great job. If only there was more depth to the plot than Leo gets mauled by bear, Leo grunts, Leo sleeps in a carcass, Leo grunts, Leo crawls across the forest, Leo swims a winter mountain stream all of which Leo of course survives to get his Oscar. I think that's what he sees at the very end."

" Requires Patience
",0.0,-0.9984,2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"An incredible picture manifested by breathtaking cinematography, 'The Revenant' exemplify's the fundamentals of courage and resilience. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the film's protagonist with Tom Hardy sharing a high-profile role. Set in the 19th century, the various landscapes presented on screen are exceptional, and manifest the adventure taking place. In 1823, Hugh Glass leads Captain Andrew Henry's trappers through the territory of the present day Dakotas. Hunting with his half-Pawnee son Hawk, Glass hears commotion coming from the camp, signalling signs of a battle; the Arikara war party attack in their numbers hoping to find their Chief's abducted daughter Powaqua causing DiCaprio and the few still alive to escape on their boat, heading towards Fort Kiowa due to Glass suggesting down the river would make the group more vulnerable. The clan stash their pelts near the shore and begin their scouting on the fort, Glass is confronted by a grizzly bear who challenges him brutally. The protagonist is able to stab the bear with his pocket knife, seeing the animal lay on top of him to its death. Weak, Glass lies on the ground nearing his death. Trapper John Fitzgerald encourages that they should kill Glass to allow the group to move forward, Henry orders people to stay with the injured Glass in exchange for money; before the money was involved only Young Jim Bridger and Hawk offered to stay, with Fitzgerald joining them following the introduction of cash. In the middle of the night, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass until Hawk spots him performing the act, assuming Hawk will tell Bridger and inevitably Henry, Fitzgerald stabs Hawk in front of Glass, the leader unable to retaliate or save his son, but instead visualise his passing and reciprocate the pain. Fitzgerald convinces Bridger that another Arikara attack is approaching and that the pair leave Glass in a makeshift grave. Reluctant at first, Bridger agrees and follows Fitzgerald, leaving Glass and his canteen that he engraved a spiral symbol into. In a meeting with Henry, Fitzgerald explains that Glass died in his sleep and that Hawk vanished, Bridger sat complicit with the lie but chose not to speak out. Glass rises and shares an emotional moment with his son who lays dead by a tree, before using the bear's fur as coating and exploring further into the wilderness. He meets a Pawnee refuge named Hikuc, the pair share stories while marching through the snowy mountains. Bridger and Fitzgerald scout a pillaged Indian village. Bridger leaves some food behind for a lone survivor. Glass and Hikuc eat a bison steak and Hikuc tells Glass that ""revenge is in the creators hands"", the refugee makes a sweat-lodge for Glass to shelter in. The next morning, Glass awakes to see that his wounds are healing and also discovers Hikuc hanged by French hunters. Successfully eluding a pursuing Arikara army on his travels previously, Glass this time takes a confrontational approach and targets the French hunters directly. Upon arriving at their camp, Glass sees the chief raping Powaqua, the protagonists opposes the chief and holds him for Powaqua to cut off his genitals, and setting her free. He then evacuates the camp on Hikuc's white horse, leaving Bridger's canteen behind, using the chief's gun to kill off any retaliating hunters. Surprisingly, Glass and the horse fall off a cliff with the soft landing saving Glass from death, unfortunately it couldn't do the same for Hikuc's horse. Glass takes out all of the horses insides and uses the carcass as insulation, sheltering and sleeping inside its cut-open stomach. A lone French surviver staggers into Fort Kiowa possessing the spiral-symbol canteen, indicating to Bridger that Glass is still alive and that the canteen had been stolen. Henry orders a search party to locate Glass' presence, Fitzgerald realises that his former leader is still alive, therefore empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass and place him in a sheltered room. Furious, Henry orders Bridger to be arrested, but Glass explains Bridger wasn't there when Hawk was murdered by Fitzgerald and instead states that Bridger was deceived by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Both Henry and Glass search for the fleeing trapper. After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills and scalps Henry. Glass uses Henry's body as a decoy on a horse and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. The pair engage in a brutal fight by a riverbank. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. Remembering Hikuc's words, Glass pushes Fitzgerald down the stream towards the Arikara kill and scalp Fitzgerald and, having found Powaqua, spare Glass. Near death, the weak frontiersman retreats into the mountains where he is greeted by the spirit of his wife. DiCaprio's only Oscar winning performance - fighting to stay alive, coping with the loss of loved ones, leading a resistance movement and venturing into the unknown. The acting and cinematography compromise the slow at times sterile spectacle."

Soundtrack is annoying, dialogue mumbled and difficult to hear. Story just does not grip you. I reached the end and just didn't care what happened. It's a reasonable film but hardly worth the two and a half hours invested. How this won an Oscar is beyond me. It only got a 5 for the bear."

One star goes to cinematography.With all respect to Leanardo DiCaprio, who is undoubtely a great actor, I have seen him in many far better movies, such as Aviator, Catch Me If You Can, Wolf of WS,..Beside a weak story repeated for many times, there is no really memorable moment of this movie. Pehaps one, when Leaonardo used a horse cadaver as a sleeping bag. And after waking up, still in winter, he just dressed up clothes hanging on a tree and walked several miles back to his camp. btw. after falling from the 20m high tree before...Is this really a several Oscars worthy movie?Many reviewers appraised the reality of the movie. However, they are somehow replacing brutality for reality. Yes, the movie is brutal. No, movie is not realistic at all and just boring to watch."
" Crawls slowly but brutally
",-0.7579,0.9845,2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"""The Revenant"" is a 2015 adventure drama directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.
⚪
All in all, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's uncompromising adaptation of the life of legendary trapper Hugh Glass crawls slowly yet vehemently through a powerfully enacted and utterly gritty survival turned revenge story that amazes with its genuine emotional intensity as well its breathtakingly atmospheric setting, and even if it might disregard the narration in order to focus on the outstanding visuals at time, the brutal performances, the intense scenery, the gorgeous cinematography, as well as the forcefully realistic special effects make this journey a heavy yet packing contemporary drama that displays an extreme historical accuracy and does the term epic cinema justice, becoming a force of nature of a film in the process.
⚪
Since it has been one of those rare days my hometown is comparatively snowbound, I decided to re-watch one of those films that have shaped my teenage years a lot. Back in the day, I was only just allowed to see the film (yes, I was still a minor back when it was released) and it was my first contact with ""heavier"" films. Like, I have never experienced such brutality before, and also haven't quite cared for this kind of genre before, but after hearing that Leo might win an Oscar for this role, I decided to jump in at the deep end - and the rest was history. After five years (!) have passed since this life-changing event, I knew that it was time to revisit, and believe it or not, I was as equally amazed by it as I was back then. It might be that the little story I just told that renders me some kind of biased, but seriously, it has once again been a phenomenal experience I savoured every single second of. ""Birdman"" director Iñárritu took on the life of the myth-enshrouded trapper Hugh Glass who famously survived a wrestle with a grizzly bear and, after being left for dead, returned to the fort he was working at after walking a distance of more than three-hundred kilometres. Ever since it happened in the 1820s, the man has become a legend, and eventually a famous part of folklore. Even though his story has been retold a thousand times and the true details of his journey remain unverifiable, all perspectives however are in an agreement about the fact that Glass was indeed attacked and mauled by a grizzly, left for dead and still managed to come back alive, and in terms of what has been passed on, this film remains historically accurate. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays the famous trapper Glass, Tom Hardy plays his colleague John Fitzgerald and Will Poulter took on the role of Jim Bridger. The reason I am mentioning the two is that they have allegedly been the men who left him behind even though he wasn't dead, what caused Glass to hunt them down one after another. However, what makes this film so packing and interesting is that Glass doesn't only have vengeance in mind, but also has to fight many other aspects as well. After the downright brutal opening scene (of which the suddenness reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan""), it becomes clear that Glass has more than one enemy to fight. Aside from the Native American people, he also must face of the hostile French trappers and, who would have guessed it, nature itself. When I say that it is the ultimate survival story, I mean that it is the ultimate survival story. Despite some things that made me question the realism of the story, it all made sense to some degree. Like, mustn't his wounds have been fatal? Wasn't his leg broken? Mustn't the cold itself killed him multiple times when he was literally lying on the ground? Anyway, those things put aside, I still think that it is a masterfully constructed adventure drama. Even if it might disregard the narration and allows it to become dragging at times in order to focus on the beauty of the visuals, I still think that it is an amazing achievement. It is a thing of taste, and I personally don't mind when a film is extremely slow-burning, and I mean, the visuals make up for that, right? Well, at least they do for me. Every single frame, every single second shot by the extremely talented Emmanuel Lubezki, takes my breath away. From shots of snowbound trees, to intense sequences in the water, all of them give me goosebumps and are downright awe-inspiring. It really feels like I was in the situation, because Lubezki managed to capture the brutality of the story perfectly. Speaking of which, another aspect of the film that still amazes me are the effects, computer generated and practical alike. I mean, I have seen many films that featured graphic violence and CGI and I had a slight idea about how they were done, but in this case, they are so extremely realistic that I was shocked. I knew that it was brutal, but I admittedly didn't remember it to be that ruthless. Like, in many scenes they came so suddenly (a certain scene that involves chopping or being clawed by a bear) or are so well crafted (animal cadavers) that it left me speechless, for I still cannot say for sure how they have done it. All of the brutality peaks in the final fight between Fitz and Glass, and the ending is just uncompromisingly entertaining. However, all of this adds to the mercilessness of the tale superbly, and it is outstanding in all departments. In all of them? Well, you cannot review this film without saying a few words about the acting. Back in the day, I was more than happy to see that Leonardo DiCaprio has won the Oscar for his role of Hugh Glass, but nowadays, after my reception of those things has evolved tremendously, I view it all differently. Undeniably, Leo delivered a brutal performance, but I don't think that literally crawling in the dirt, making a pained face and eating a real bison's liver as a vegan are in the same street as his portrayal of Jordan Belfort in ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" or anything he has done before, let alone Michael Fassbender's performance as Steve Jobs in the biopic of the same name. Honestly, even Tom Hardy delivered better than him as his enemy Fitzgerald, but since it was ""his time"", Leo won, in my opinion, undeservedly. Another thing I only realised upon a rewatch is that the film also doesn't hesitate to express social commentary as well. Yes, mostly the Native American people are referred to as ""savages"" and are attacking the protagonist, but still the director included some scenes about who is really stealing from whom, and this deserves my respect. In the end, this film is a hit or miss for many cinephiles I know. Many consider it too long, unbalanced in terms of pacing and even boring, but I think it is a cold-hearted journey that balances masterfully between being beautiful and brutal. It is a story about revenge, willpower and survival, and all of that touches me a lot, especially since it has also a more surreal feeling to it. The frequent dream sequences and appearances of Glass's dead wife add an emotional and spiritual level to it that make the open ending heartbreakingly touching. It is outstandingly crafted, utterly realistic and probably the closest we got to monumental filmmaking in years. Undeniably, a phenomenal experience, after all."

" The Revenant is an achievement in filmmaking, an adventure you will never forget
",0.4526,0.9993,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Alejandro González Iñárritu serves as a director, producer and co-writer in this breathtaking and incredible movie.
The Revenant is based on the historical fiction book of the same name and it is about Hugh Glass and his experiences in 1823 when he guided Captain Andrew Henry and his trappers through the territory of the present-day Dakota. It's an adventure you won't forget, with the film being shot in a continuous shot or its what we are believed to think as its superb editing makes it unnoticeable when they cut the camera.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass and we follow everything through the eyes of that character, other actors in the film are Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. But Leonardo and Tom has the best performances, Leo actually won his first Oscar for best acting in a leading role. If you watch the movie then you will understand why he won, he even called it the hardest performance of his career and I believe him.The story and screenplay is fantastic but nothing special, the huge amount of aunthencity is where it shines though. The director and producers hired consultants to make the Arikara culture as accurate as possible, small and big things like that makes a movie so much more better as it gets more believable.On the technical side of things it's a really well made movie, from the production design to cinematography. The latter won an Oscar for Achievement in Cinematography and I agree. It's breathtaking from start to finish, I still remember a lot of scenes from the first time I watched the movie which was in 2015 at the cinema, the experience was amazing. Alejandro González Iñárritu also won an Oscar for best Director which I agree 100% with. Incredible musical score and sound design. Costume and makeup department was fantastic, the amount of attention to detail and how authentic everything is. The musical score is powerful and gives you goosebumps, it's that powerful. The overall production was perfect, not a single bad thing that I can think of.This was the third time I watched it, first time was at the cinema and that was the true way to watch it but watching it at home comes close. The Revenant is a memorable experience and a great movie, it's filled with phenomenal acting and scenes so beautifully shot. It won 3 Oscars but got nominated for more, its best picture nomination was worthy as it truly is one of the best motion pictures of 2015."

I've spent nearly five decades studying western North American history and prehistory with stints teaching prehistory and native cultures at the university level. I sat to watch fully expecting the film to be the usual Hollywood historical sloop. Instead I found myself riveted to the screen. The cinematography was incredible, the soundtrack unforgettable, and the performances uniformly wonderful. There were a few historical inaccuracies but not many. Some reviews complain about the slow pace. I didn't find pacing remotely objectionable. Just be prepared to witness a story well told. Pacing in deliberate and the film is laced with symbolism that is apt to be missed by those unfamiliar with The Ashley Expedition, the intense rivalries between American, British, and French Canadian fur trapping companies; and the history of the wars among the northern plains tribes after the Sioux moved west from Minnesota after c. 1780. The Sioux, Arikara, and Pawnee hated each other, and their fighting is depicted in many films, notably Dances With Wolves. The film isn't hard to follow. It's intensity makes it unsuitable for those with squeamish stomachs. I think it's one the best films of the past 20 years.

" Good performance by DiCaprio and amazing direction, but film is superfluously long and bland at parts
",0.5187,-0.5951,2020-12-26 00:00:00,5,"This is one of those character-study films and also one of those film that don't know what their genre is - Action? Drama? Thriller? Western? It's a confused movie when it comes to its genres. If it wanted to be a full-fledged revenge film, then it would've been a really good and entertaining one. By cutting at least 30-40 minutes of the footage. Most of which involve the Natives and Leonard DiCaprio breathing and puffing on the camera. Totally irrelevant scenes.Now this may sound like I have a short attention span. But how is watching people breathing and walking entertaining? Give me long bouts of talking scenes with good performances. That, I would watch. But a guy breathing, looking around, sitting down, standing up, and repeat, is not ""phenomenal"". It's not even acting. Just a time filler. And voila, it worked, the film is 2 hrs and 40 mins long thanks to such redundant scenes.Tom Hardy's character was a typical bad guy. That cold-hearted, despicable antagonist you want dead after seeing the horrible things he does and says. And so DiCaprio's character wants to have his revenge. Been there done that. It's amazing how some films nowadays get away with blatant unoriginality. The 8.0/10 rating here is really laughable. This is just a revenge film with some drama, historical content and grittiness thrown in. Apparently, if you add these, you'll have rave reviews coming your way. But I ain't buying it.The direction and cinematography were great. I would rewatch this film just for its good camerawork and, of course, the bear scene attack - Which is, I think, the only memorable scene in this film. Other than that, the film is forgettable."

Paul Bunyan & Babe seemed more plausible!There was also an undertone of political correctness vis-a-vis interactions with the Pawnee nation, attempting to suggest ""our hero"" was ahead of his time in terms of inclusion.I watched it, appreciated the production and direction, but. reflected that this was a C19 version of a Marvel comic."

This movie is absolute crap marinated with excellent photography and a bunch of great actors.I do not understand how this garbage has reached this rating when other movies with much much more merit are rated terribly.The relationship that drives revenge is never properly established and everything spills out to force everything that continues afterward. Not to mention that the whole movie this guy spends his time swimming like he's on some tropical beach enjoying the pleasant weather.
" Truly beautiful, from a visual point of view, is the film that finally gave an Oscar to Di Caprio.
",0.7783,0.9977,2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"It is impossible to take a film that has been nominated for twelve Oscars and not be left with any kind of expectation, especially if the film manages to bring together two of the big names in cinema today: Leonardo Di Caprio and Alejandro González Iñarritu. In this case, the film exceeded my expectations. The narrative tells a fictional story about one of the trips of Hugh Glass, an American pioneer and adventurer who actually existed. In this film, he is the guide of a group of hunters who venture into native territory to collect animal fur, a valuable and profitable item at that time. When the group is attacked by Indians and only a few survive, Glass leads them until he is attacked by a bear and is abandoned on the verge of death. Then he begins a struggle to survive, to return to the colony and to punish those who abandoned him.Firstly, I loved the story. It is a classic story of revenge with an aroma of ""Count of Monte Cristo"" that has nothing astounding, but works well. Iñarritu knew how to give the film an excellent rhythm and dynamics, where there are no dead moments and everything is perfectly articulated and completely clear and noticeable. For me, what displeased me most was the invention of a son that the main character never had and that only exists in the film to increase the dramatic effect, but it is something that we managed to forgive before all the redeeming qualities that this film presents. It also has several action scenes with struggles, ambushes, deaths and even a rape (not explicit, but clear).The cast is a fundamental part of the value of this film. Leonardo Di Caprio is a great actor, one of the best of our time, and he had nothing more to prove when he decided to make this film. He started a career in roles where all he had to do was be pretty, but he evolved, he became a real chameleon capable of surprising us with each film. But he still wanted to win the Oscar for Best Actor, for which he had already been nominated three times (in 2005 with the film ""The Aviator"", in 2007 for his work on ""Blood Diamond"" and in 2014 for ""The Wolf of Wall Street""). Di Caprio appears here as we have never seen him, with an almost raw and violent realism. Tom Hardy also did an extraordinary job, giving life to the greedy selfish Fitzgerald, and Will Poulter, who we still remember to see emerging for the cinema in one of the Narnia trilogy films, is truly moving in a naive and nice character. Domhnall Gleeson was also excellent.In addition to the engaging story and a strong cast that gives everything it has to surprise us, the film features the skill and detail of González Iñarritu, attentive to the smallest details and realism of what he is filming. Once again, he had the collaboration of the experienced Emmanuel Lubezki, who had already signed the cinematography of ""Birdman"", also by this director. The film is visually magnificent: the camera moves in our perspective as if we were part of everything, running away from the Indians and crawling on the floor; the skillful use of colors, natural light (not a single spotlight was used), filming in a real location, contrast and the effect of blur and depth gave the film a realism that almost transports us into the screen. The use of excellent costumes and the construction of genuine sets has also helped, and allows us to be better placed in the historical period when everything is happening. I can understand those people who criticized the film for exaggerating a bit in the filming of trees, sky and landscapes, its something that can tire some viewers, but I liked that and, for me, it was an additional quality. The use of CGI has not been overlooked, in particular to recreate the animals and the bear, but everything is so realistic that we can almost doubt the use of CGI. The sound and special effects also worked perfectly and the soundtrack is truly effective."

" Visually stunning, and one of the best hero's journeys I have ever seen
",0.7783,-0.9139,2020-11-20 00:00:00,9,"The Revenant is mostly liked because of it's visuals because it was filmed in true natural conditions and the camera work is amazing.
But what truly blew my mind was the psychological structure and the journey of our hero.
The basic hero's journey tells the story of a character who starts from a confortable or a leader position and falls into chaos. He then has to redeem himself and conquer the obstacles in order to get back to his initial positions (his home) but bigger and stronger. The plot of The Revenant shows us that journey, as the main character begins being a leader, then falls into chaos with his accident and the death of if son, which pushes him to redeem himself in order to conquer his enemy and get the vengeance he deserves.
But what if I tell you that his journey goes even further than his quest of revenge?
In the beginning of the film, we see the main character in a home situation with his wife and his son, and at the end of the movie he feels again the presence of this peaceful home situation.
So my interpretation is this, the real beginning of the character's story begins when he is at peace with his family. And the moment he falls into chaos is when his wife gets killed. So basically, when the movie begins, the character is already in chaos. He then suffers the loss of his child and is forced to seek vengeance, while at the same time seeking peace and return to his home situation. At the end of the movie, he finds his redemption in peace and doesn't really kill his enemy but let's the fate decide. That was his real hero's journey : a fall from peace to chaos, and a quest to return to his peaceful state, bigger, stronger and mature."

" The Revenant is a technical masterpiece with arguably the best supporting performance of the year
",0.8807,0.893,2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"The Revenant starts with an incredible battle when Captain Henry's men get ambushed by a group of savages. The battle is filmed in one shot and the visuals and camerawork are just brilliant. This is one of the best looking movies i've seen, everything from the lighting to the CGI and the camerawork are top tier. One word to describe how this movie looks is ""Eyegasm"" :)
All jokes aside let's talk about the movie itself. The Revenant is about Hugh glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his journey of survival after being badly wounded. As simple as the movie sounds, it's not only about Glass it's also a lot about the other characters and their journeys . Fitzgerald is such an amazing character and aslo completely insane. I've never hated a fictional character (technically fictional) this much and that's due Tom Hardy's incredible performance. DiCaprio was also great perhaps not quite an Oscar level performance tho. This is a visual masterpiece from how the arrows fly to Glass's wounds everything looks great. The story is 90% Glass and it gets slightly boring at times but i'll let it slide. Overall The Revenant is a great film about survival, revenge, the beauty and cruelness of nature and making the right choices."

" Nice image, acting and representation of native Americans, too slow and not historically truthful
",0.0823,0.9709,2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"I liked a lot the beautiful landscapes shown in the movie, the powerful and indifferent nature. I liked the representation of native Americans, the different languages used in the movie (I want to believe they were accurate) and showing cultural things like prayers and methods they had and used, like the shelter built by Hikuc and the scene in which they eat bison together. DiCaprio and Thomas Hardy are both amazing actors and the cast in general is really good. It's crazy that Hardy is an Englishman and he has such a credible accent. That said, the movie is a bit too slow for my taste. Plus, There's something I don't like about using a historical character and change what he represents. I understand that it's nice to have a hero that seems to be a bridge with Native Americans and to respect and know their culture well, but with a quick research we know that the real life Glass disliked the native Americans and that the real story didn't go exactly like this. Overall, still a nice movie"

Unfortunately, these expectations were not met and the film left me deflated. The plot itself is okay but is overshadowed by the performances not being anything special. My main gripe is that i feel Di Caprio is criminally underused in the film and he is reduced to crawling around and grunting for the majority of the film. I feel Leo has 10 performances or more that outplay this one and the lack of dimensions within the character is not his fault whatsoever. In contrast, the action sequences within this were superb and balanced the gore with reality perfectly. This is nowhere near one of Leo's best but the visuals and action are superb. Give it a watch if you fancy the sound of it!"

Also, one of the best opening scenes in cinema, in my opinion."

" I don't have the motivation to keep watching.
",-0.2584,-0.9767,2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,"The first fight scene is too long. A battle scene or an action scene is boring to watch unless you know why the main characters are fighting. Moreover, these scenes were shot in close proximity with a wide angle camera. It's a very realistic shot, but if it used in the first scene, the director looks drunk and the audience gets cold feet. Secondly, the name of the antagonist is not good. When I thought the atmosphere of the film resembled ""Aguirre's Wrath of God"", I was shocked to listen the name of the protagonist, the title of Herzog's other masterpiece. This is one of those places where the director is drunk on his own, and that's why he does this. Next, there's a bear. This bear doesn't bite at all and doesn't attack with its claws. The film has been shot in such a way that you can see how it's doing. This is where the director's incompetence comes into play. The bears bite, so he had to prepare a doll to show the bear biting, and he had to deal with it well so that you wouldn't find out that he wasn't biting. As the story progresses, the antagonist becomes clearer and clearer, but this antagonist is too small fish character. The antagonist needs to be a bit bigger and more human to be interesting. It makes me feel fed up that the story is going to progress to defeat this antagonist. Overall, I would have to say that this is a low level work."

",0.0,0.9698,2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"Is this a work of unparalleled realism? Is its camerawork as inventive and daring as Citizen Kane's? Does its loyalty to location shooting make Werner Herzog look like Tim Burton? Is it less compelling than A Brief History Of Drying Paint? The answer is yes. This may not even play right to Ron Swanson, as he sits there alone with his steak and bourbon. This is the movie that comes to mind when I have the flu. If LOTR were *nothing but* walking, it would still be a welcome relief from this literal crawl of a (true) sleeper. Not enough good can be said of this amazing vision, and not enough bad can be said about it either. In the end, it's not meant to be mainstream. That's the big truth here. It's an art film all the way, despite its subject matter."

",-0.4215,-0.9693,2020-08-12 00:00:00,5,"There was a decent film here trying to get out, but Hollywood's soulless hands are all over it. No character is credible, no interaction or conversation comes from the real world, all are leaden and contrived. Everything is two dimensional and every single thing is utterly predictable from the first scene. But is in the action that it fails miserably. We are expected to believe someone at deaths door can be hiking up a mountainside and flying down rapids in freezing water within 24 hours or so? Anyone who has spent five minutes in the great outdoors in freezing winter will tell you that unless you can emerge from freezing water, get completely dry within an hour, and stay warm...you are dead. He wakes up in sodden clothes, five metres from the fire...which has been burning all night! And there's no source of firewood! Oh yeah, and he dives into the freezing cold river (again!) And promptly catches a fish, which he eats raw! And there's a cooking fire within arm's reach! And on and on it goes.."
" Superb tale of resolve and retribution...
",0.7717,-0.889,2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"There is something gloriously brutal about this film - not in an especially violent, nor gory manner - but just in the combination of the best and worst of human traits (resilience, determination, betrayal, desertion, lust etc.) coupled with a truly magnificent depiction of the harshness of a wild Missouri winter. Leonardo DiCaprio is ""Glass"", who when out hunting with his team is savagely attacked by a bear. He is then for dead by his colleagues. To stay alive, he must use his innate skills to survive the environment and the hostile natives to get back to civilisation - all fuelled by his overwhelming desire for revenge on those who abandoned him to the elements. Iñárritu directs this adventure with considerable skill; you are immersed into the struggle ""Glass"" has for his very life and then into his vengeful hunt for Tom Hardy ""Fitzgerald"" whom he blames for his predicament. It may be that the director is trying to draw parallels between man's treatment of each other and of their treatment of nature - and of how there is little difference in the consideration afforded to either; but that's tangential in my view. This is an hugely enjoyable, character-driven, gritty film that builds slowly and relentlessly to a fitting denouement and left me looking for a cardigan."
" Not accurate but still good.
",0.5927,0.331,2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,"First off, the visuals in this movie are breathtaking. In not a fan of continuous one shot movies (even though I loved 1917) but the way this movie intertwines traditional cuts and continuous one shot scenes is fantastic. The ability to make you feel dread, just as the main character feels with the camera work and up close struggle is breathtaking.Now on to the story. It's meh, not historic but that's ok. The story is the classic ""Revenge for death of loved one against all odds"" tale. However, it's done very well, the story is simple but impactful, drawn out but quick and by the end even though the final fight is a bit cliche I'd say the rest of the movie makes up for the cliche ish moments.(Although I have to say I've seen better cgi when it came to that bear scene.)"

'The Revenant' isn't necessarily edge-of-your-seat viewing, though it's still a massively impactful watch as you feel every hit of Hugh Glass' journey. It's rather gruesome and bloody, while it also has a few top notch action sequences.Leonardo DiCaprio is easily one of my favourite actors of all-time, the man is simply a sensational actor - I'm yet to see an anything less than tremendous film involving him. I wouldn't even say this is his greatest performance, and that's saying something as DiCaprio is absolutely superb here.Away from the main man, Tom Hardy is also part of this film. He is great, as I always expect from him. He and DiCaprio are fantastic actors. Hardy portrays John Fitzgerald, brilliantly. However, his character isn't written perfectly - not poorly by any stretch, he's just a bit flip-floppy at the beginning. The way the story creates itself involving Fitzgerald being where he is isn't as amazing as it could've been - very minor criticism, mind.Another small complaint is the ending, there's nothing truly wrong with it at all but I, personally, would've concluded things about 10-15 minutes prior - there's a quality, almost Quentin Tarantino-esque, scene involving horses that would've made for a more thrilling end shot.To finish, everything's beautifully crafted together visually, from a filmmaker's viewpoint, too. A marvellous film no doubt, certainly a must-watch!"
" CGI Masterclass
",0.0,-0.8999,2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Its the wild, wild west... But not as we know it!
An unbelievable (and sometimes laughable) survivability from the protagonist... Glass makes James Bond look like a real pussy...
Far removed from The Man With No Name....
And even further from McClintock...
Brutally grim and 'realistic' (there are NO redeeming heroes in this tale), but lacking the charm and wit of those earlier incarnations of the genre.
Watchable in a punishing way...."
" Leo finally got his Oscar and you can see why
",0.0,-0.9266,2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,It's been 5 years since I watched The Revenant and it was on bbc2 last night so decided to give it a go again.Leo should have won an Oscar this way before this (wolf of Wall Street is one that sticks in my mind) but I can appreciate why he finally did this time. Not being able to speak for major parts of the feel you can feel his stress and pain.Some of the camera angles on the first fight are top class. There are also moments Leo's breath is on the camera and a moment with Fitzgerald that I enjoyed.The bear fight - crazily incredible.Glad he got his vengeance.Would have scored higher only the ending is too ambiguous. Did he die? If so where was his lad? Or Did he not need his wife anymore and she was showing him the way home?
" A fistful of grit but not a lot of substance
",0.0,0.9848,2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a motion picture of minor miracles. For each and every unlikely scenario that Leonardo manages to negotiate, there is an equally unbelievable piece of scenery or cinematography to boot. If Inarritu's assessment of the book left him salivating at the perfect vehicle to showcase his talents, it is the genius of Emmanuel Lubezski who bestows upon it the characteristics of a turbo charged 4x4. No overbearing script or demanding chronology here to form a distraction from the visual tour de force, but ironically the only distraction to arise comes as a result of the viewer's expectation of a plot twist that never materialises.
That you will come away feeling hypothermic and finding yourself dialing the good samaritans is in part testament to the human and environmental brutality on display, but in all honesty the same effect might be achieved by staring into my freezer unit for two and a half hours.
Not many Oscars are won through grunting and shivering, but Di Caprio makes a decent go of it, whilst Hardy just about fulfils his mandate to be public enemy number one, and Poulter too is solid enough as the man caught in the middle whose purpose it is to restore some modicum of faith in humanity.
Even the sun glare of perma-white tundra can't hide a number of conspicuous flaws from start to finish, such as the protagonist regaining the ability to walk despite having been restricted to crawl-mode prior to an extended dip in a free flowing waterfall riddled Ice cold river.
If we are to concentrate on the films strengths and qualities, and ignore the fact that by a quarter in we already know exactly how this one is going to play out, then it really is a feast for your eyes, a long as you have the stomach to digest it.
The eggs were all firmly placed in the same visceral basket here, and I think it's fair to say some of them survived the brutal ride just about intact."

" Expected more
",0.0,-0.9825,2020-07-17 00:00:00,4,"Like many reviewers, I have mixed feelings about this movie. There is beauty but also confusion in the plot. Some scenes look familiar & probably copied from previous movies. like many, expected much more and was shocked at the end (that seemed to never arrive! ) because both my husband and I agreed that we did not like it. I read somewhere that the real Hugh Glass, a guide & a fur trapper, was attacked by a grizzly but had time to shot him and though terribly injured, kept him at bay with a knife until the rest of the group came to rescue him and killed the bear. But there was no Indian son nor Indian wife, only revenge. His ordeal did not happen in Winter, nor there were mountain ranges nor raw meat or swimming in cold water. He did build a raft that took him to the fort. Once there, unfortunately there was no revenge because smart Fitzgerald signed as a Scout with the US Army, therefore ""untouchable""...Glass was hoping to wait until Fitsgerald retired & while waiting continued to work as a guide & fur trapper but his life was cut short when killed by an Indian tribe (Arika?) One thing, I have not heard mentioned is that we all assume the revenant refers to Hugh Glass, coming back from the dead, but I wonder if it also refers to his wife's ghost that keep showing up to encourage him during his journey...perhaps that is the scenes I like best. I avoided the famous grizzly scene because I had recently watched an episode of ""survival"" of a Canadian man mewled & scalped by a grizzly, so that was enough for me."
" It's like a winter western
",0.3612,0.8834,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,Revenge in story centred on the frontier are staples in American cinema and this modern take on a classic set up is interesting and entertaining. I liked the cinematography and colour grading as well as the grit and in the action sequence which are visually interesting. Although I do find it hard to believe a human would survive all that the main character goes through it was an overall good experience despite being long.
" Very good film about one man surviving for one purpose
",0.659,0.5809,2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Like i said this a great film about a man surviving against nature and everything else for one purpose and one purpose only, revenge.Great acting, especially from Tom Hardy, not saying that Dicaprio was bad. The cinematography of course is amazing, the bear atack scene is extremely weel done, one of those scenes who are going to enter in cinema history, and the fight scene in the end is also amaziling done and violent in the context of the film.In my opinion Dicaprio character dies in the ending of the film, he only maintain himself alive because he need to get to that point, and after he got his revenge, he just let himself go."
" Stunning location & cinematography
",0.3818,0.5919,2020-07-12 00:00:00,6,"The story is a straightforward one about human greed, the will to survive, and revenge. The cinematography and bleak wilderness location are stunning - worth watching just for this. But a large part hinges on the survival motif, and the movie would have been much better if much attention had been paid to to the details and realism. More build up or context would have helped to empathise with the characters more. Brilliantly filmed, brutal, and bleak - but somehow rather lacking emotional impact."

",0.0,0.9986,2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"The Academy Award winning Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu took Michael Punke's novel, and really turned it into something of his own. AGI captured countless breathtaking shots, utilizing a lot of long-wide takes, and some hand held shots. The premise is a little played out, but he did a BRILLIANT job putting a creative and unique twist to nature, and human nature. With AGI incorporating this tremendous act of risk at all times, it really helped to keep the audience engaged, and to not pay too much attention to the longer runtime. The opening scene made for such a crazy first act. With such a hard hitting opening, you have to keep that same energy throughout each act, but AGI slowed down the pace a little bit come the second act, incorporating some emotional notes, while being a little repetitive with his direction. The third act capitalized on the speed change prior, and became a very entertaining, high octane final act.With Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy leading the charge, you know you're automatically in for a treat. After all of Leo's Academy Award performances, HE FINALLY RECEIVED HIS FIRST OSCAR, being so well deserved! His emotions felt so genuine, that you can truly feel his pain, and really connect with his character. Tom Hardy also put on such a fantastic performance, also being nominated for an Academy Award. His character had a very clear notion, and was a very big part of the way things unfold. The acting overall was very good, without anyone overshadowing one another. The tattered & dirty costume design by Jacqueline West was so articulate and well designed, with the makeup & hairstyles being the cherry on top to complete that rugid look.The Academy Award Winning Emmanuel Lubezki took over the photography, and my God, was it beautiful. He utilized the beautiful natural lighting, while also incorporating a lot of dark colors to embrace the gritty & cruel tone. Not only was the cinematography gorgeous, but the visual & practical effects absolutely stole the show.... and most of the budget. The visual effects added this level of grit to the film, making everything feel so real, from the action to the climate. AGI and the effects team did an amazing job making you feel like you were in the movie. I was cold when there was a bitter cold scene, I felt the pain with all the injuries; AGI really knows how to connect to the audience.Overall, the 3 awards & 12 nominations speak for themselves. This is an absolute must see, especially for the DiCaprio & Hardy fans out there!"
" A bone-chilling and shudderful tale of survival and revenge with atmospheric brilliance.
",0.128,0.9767,2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"The Revenant (2015) :
Brief Review -A bone-chilling and shudderful tale of survival and revenge with atmospheric brilliance. Breathtaking ! The Revenant reminded me of some brilliant atmospheric films naturally because the story isn't something at all to praise but taking the corney story through brilliant cinematic experience is really Something. Even after watching several atmospheric classics such as ""Platoon"", ""Alien"" and a recent one ""1917"", i still find The Revenant truly a Breathtaking cinematic experience. The film is about a frontiersman who has been betrayed and left behind to die in the snowballed mountains. His son is killed by the partner who betrayed rest of them and left him behind to die. How he struggles to be alive so that he can take revenge is all what you see in The Revenant. This may be an ordinary script but screenplay and on screen crafting is absolutely conspicuous. It is a learning lesson on how to mould an ordinary writing into an extraordinary presentation. Leonardo DiCaprio is in top form throughout the film. I said it many times he deserved Oscar award for Titanic but didn't get it and finally when he got it, he made sure people will remember his performance forever. This is that performance to remember. Tom Hardy as the rascal is equally notable. Background music is chilling and definitely helps a lot in overall impact of every bone chilling scene. I don't know how to praise Alejandro G. Iñárritu for his directorial achivements in this film. He won 2nd consecutive Oscar Award for Best Director which is not at all arguable. Birdman might not be unarguable (it is not actually if you remember technical achivements and accuracy in long shots) but The Revenant is most Deserving accolade for him. Overall, The Revenant is a Must See, just make sure you watch in no disturbance environment. A Classic!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
" The brutal simplicity of the film
",-0.6249,-0.5485,2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Both the argument and the evolution of it could not be easier: A man overcomes an almost certain death to take revenge on another. Also, don't expect great subtleties in Reve The Revenant ', as you go for visceral simplicity rather than really delving into the emotions behind it.Is there something wrong with that decision? Not at all, especially if we take into account that both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy know how to adapt perfectly, the first showing perfectly his brutal determination and the second stressing the vermin that he is. Both share a powerful spirit of survival, albeit for different reasons."

The struggle between human beings and nature is not only reflected in the game between the hero Leo and nature, but also in the collision between advanced civilization and primitive civilization, which is staged in such magnificent and bleak scenery."
" violent, breathtaking tale of survival
",-0.2263,-0.9076,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"DiCaprio stuns in this violent, breathtaking tale of survival.The Revenant is an astonishing sensory and visual experience, depicting Mother Nature at its most serene & perilous. The visuals are honestly mesmerising, almost like you're on the front-line of filming a David Attenborough documentary. (I absolutely loved that the camera steamed up with Glass' breath during close ups - it really made you feel like you were RIGHT next to him).I was physically & emotionally exhausted just watching this! Poor Glass never seems to catch a break. Loss; grief, treachery, multiple attacks - his suffering is incomprehensible - all whilst navigating through an environment so inhospitable he has to gut a horse and sleep inside it. Like his surroundings, Glass is also a force to be reckoned with. Throughout the film, his endurance is awe inspiring; his torturous journey both electrifying & terrifying - to the point it becomes absurd. (forget superhero's, Glass is the real thing). DiCaprio gave his ALL to this film, and it is evident in every single frame. He has very little to run with in terms of dialogue, but maaaan he could be in a silent movie and still be utterly captivating.Tom Hardy tends to mumble quite a lot (to the extent he could have been wearing his Bane mask)- nevertheless he was sublime as the brutish, half scalped menace Fitzgerald. Will Poulter's performance as Bridger was brilliant too, I felt every bit of his trepidation and uneasiness about leaving Glass behind, and his shock when he returns (quite literally) from the grave.I wasn't a huge fan of the recurring dreams Glass had about his wife - it didn't bring much to the film & created a distraction from the revenge plot surrounding his son. If there had been more of a backstory in the beginning, with her as an actual character (and not a ghost) then I'd have felt differently."

Tom Hardy and Leo was perfect choices for these two roles. I adore the love story they created about Hugh Glass and the years he spent with the Pawnee Tribe.
The bear fight is just so real I could feel the pain.
This story isn't only about Hugh Glass but the pain and suffering of the native people in the ""great"" now USA..."

Tom Hardy is awesome in supporting role. Thirdly, the places, where all happen, are beautiful, operator's work os perfect.
So, it's good film with stunning views of nature."

If you love DiCaprio though and you love rather bleak action movies this could be your thing anyway.The bad: the direction. Innaritu simply is only suited for making great and subtle dramas, he is totally not suited for full blown action movies, which this is. More bad: the supporting actors are MEDIOCRE at best. So annoying. Even more bad: the photography is suited for beautiful nature shots, of which there are quite a few and they ARE impressive indeed, but this particular photography is not suited for such a bleak fighting movie, it simply looks too pretty, too flashy.Not any good? If you like bleak fighting movies about men who live in holes in the ground then this is your pick. There are certainly a lot worse movies out there than this one..."

This movie is about a guy who gets betrayed and left for dead by his own hunting team, but luckily he got up and went all the way to get his revenge on them, mostly to Tom Hardy's character.The main character barely had any dialogue and the film is 2 hours and 30 minutes long which is incredible, my favourite quote from Leo's character is ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I done it already."" it gives the character power and more strength even more than an average superhero gets.The entire film looked so real and it felt like we weren't even watching a movie and more like a documentary or a guy went back in time and shot all the stuff that happened, one of the reasons why the movie looked real was because of the lightings, the movie crew did not use one single studio light and only used natural light or fire which was really impressive and it this movie has one of the best cinematography ever put into a film. This is a movie that will be remembered for a very long time people in the next 10-20 years will go back and check this movie out and study it just like other great classic movies like 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull'."

Its hyperrealistic execution magnifies the implausibility of the details (many many many details and the entire storyline), the lack of an actual story (this movie is really boring despite all the brutality) and even the lack of real characters (with some exceptions).

Lots of scenery shots, footage of rivers and mountains. Leo being cold and surviving in the wild in questionable ways. Mauled on a Monday, climbing and swimming by Friday.Then the ending came around. The build up, the point of the movie... Anticlimactic to say the least.

It's mixture of Tarkovsky-like visuals and rarely photographed backdrops are easy to admire as well. On the other hand I was left feeling the characters and story weren't created with the same majesty. The core story could have easily been transplanted into a B western from the 1950's. Maybe that was the intention but if so I don't understand why. This had the skeleton of a transcendental work-of-art but the body laid over that skeleton was nothing but stale hokum. I will probably return to watch it again in 5 or so years and see if my opinion has changed for better or worse. As it stands, I'm torn on it's quality."

" A punishing tale of survival at any cost
",-0.5574,0.4229,2020-04-11 00:00:00,9,"The story of The Revenant is a simple but powerful one. A truly devastating tale following the desperate struggle of a man to survive against all odds in a desolate and punishing environment. A tale of revenge, love, and loss which packs so many emotional punches. It's a testament to the quality of the story and direction that this film absolutely flew by. It really didn't feel like two and a half hours and was paced very well. That was never a given with this story either. The middle third could have dragged, but avoided that pitfall completely.A large part of that is due to DiCaprio, who was exceptional. The emotion that he brought to this performance was astounding, and the pain that he felt (both emotionally and physically) was so real. What was most extraordinary from this performance is that it was very physical and visceral. He managed to convey an abundance of emotion and feeling from a relatively bare script, using his body and face to their full capacity. His Oscar was most definitely deserved for this performance. Alongside DiCaprio the support cast were all good, if not too present throughout the film.The cinematography of The Revenant was beautiful, with many scenes feeling like pictures. The setting really made this film incredible, establishing the bleak and punishing environment of the Dakotas expertly. The danger that Glass was facing because of this environment was made all the more real by the cinematography and direction - it wasn't simply to make the film look pretty, but to drive the story onward, which it did to great effect.From the survival techniques through to the fight scenes this film felt incredibly gritty and realistic. The stunt choreographers, the cinematography, direction, and performances all contributed to this realism, producing a spectacular piece of cinema that can't be missed."

" Sickness of ice and fire
",-0.34,-0.9866,2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"This film was once again directed by Alessandro Gonzalez Inaritu, who won the Oscar for Best Director Award, and once again won the Oscar for Best Director Award. This film also won the Oscar Best Best Film Award. In fact, this film can also be named the soul reviver or the soul of the dead.
The film tells that Grass was seriously injured by a bear while hunting, and was then taken care of by fellow Fitz players. He took over 300 dollars and took care of it. He carelessly killed Glass's son and tricked Jim away. Grasse. Later, Grass survived stubbornly and insisted on looking for Fitz 's revenge. Finally, with the death of the captain, he succeeded in revenge on a river.
The beginning of the movie begins with a series of long shots that are extremely difficult to shoot. The Indians besieged the team of Grasse, the setting of natural light, the fleeing of water, smoke, horses, and dragons. A racial and alien killing is being staged . The five-minute fight with Bear in the woods is also a long shot that the director is good at. Every time the bear attacks, every time the Grass groans, this sense of reality makes the viewer 's heart beat, knife. See blood. The scenes shot in the movie are magnificent and magnificent. They are vast and magnificent nature, mysterious and dangerous ice fields, and high and distant mountains, set against a small person, and constitute a picture of the confrontation between man and nature. Man and life The epic of struggle. The climax of the film followed the survival of Grasse. Grasse, who was seriously injured, climbed out of the grave, burned the wound with gunpowder, and dived into the river to escape the pursuit of the Li people. After such torture, he survived, returned to the camp, and officially began his revenge. The violent aesthetic mixed with the film is not violence for survival, but an instinctively weak meat and strong food. Grass 's lines are very few. Basically, it is a unicorn drama, especially in the endless ice field. The lonely is not only the loneliness of the body but also the loneliness of the loss of wife and child. The expression of Grass seems to be a line, speechless and deep, and the viewer has pity for the pain of survival. His belief is the narration that runs through the film many times in the dream. ""As long as you can breathe, you must fight and continue to breathe."" The reason for living is revenge and faith.
I noticed the images used in the film: the birds flying out of the chest after the death of my wife, the death knell in the dream, and the sky flashed through the sky and fell into flames. At the beginning, I thought that the kind of bird was a crow, which represented the messenger of death. Later, I thought that it could also represent the freedom of death. Because of the suffering in the world, I was happy after death. This can also explain that when Grass saw his wife happy Image. The death knell can also be regarded as the death of a son. The moment when the falling sky fire appeared, it made me think it was ""Icarus"" in ancient Greek mythology-with a pair of waxy wings, flying to the sun, and finally falling, he represents the pursuit of faith, which should be in the movie It also refers to the passing away of Grasse's faith, and should also represent the demise of the tribe represented by his wife and children and the Poni people who saved him. All three images can be regarded as death or the loss of an existing thing. This is a part of Grasse's confrontation. This part-death belongs to a powerful and irreversible nature. Grasse's life is as small as a mustard. Under one kind of contrast, it became more and more small and could not withstand a blow. Highlighting life and life 's revenge is not worth mentioning in such a natural environment, so that the phrase ""The revenge is in the hands of God"" that flashed over at the end of Glass 's revenge on Fitz will not be abrupt. This kind of person struggling with swords and arrows and cold snow and ice, fighting a shot hanging in the line, tells us that life is paid and impermanent. Grass 's instantaneous understanding of God seemed to him that he had to follow suit. It was like a mission, like a gift from you against nature.
This film is about the life of ice and fire. With the help of people's understanding of life, it can resonate with the soul of the viewer. In the art, sound effects, shots, and narrative, you can pick it out separately. The best Oscar film is really named Return."

I like the story itself: a hunter who defies the odds and comes back to kill his son's murderer. But there's just no way that a man, who is destroyed by a bear, to just get up on his feet in such a short time. He was bleeding from his entire body, especially his neck. Stitches don't heal those kind of injuries. I'm not gonna be too critical, however, because it's just a movie after all.

It may have dragged on a bit but I believe it was vital to show how brutal life was during that time especially trying to eek out a life in an unfriendly country during a harsh cold winter. This movie made me feel as if I was there. I shook just thinking about the cold. I felt the pain of Glass as he was mauled and then fought to recover. DiCaprio was brilliant but I believe Tom Hardy stole the show here. The director and writers did take some creative liberties with the story but in my opinion it still worked.

It is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing, the whole cast (Tom Hardy is great here) is great. The costumes and weapons used (early 1800s) look so damn good. The story is very simple and not complicated. It is about revenge and surviving in the cold and icy wilderness of 1823. The action scenes are brutal and gritty, like they should be for that time period. Officially in my top 10 movies of all time. If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it or buy it. It definitely deserves to be in your collection. Some people might not like all the spiritual stuff or reading subtitles (lots of Native American language here) but it is needed since there a lot of interaction with Native American tribes here.

The final ""product"" or ""work of art"" is a fufiling expirence and executed perfectly, this movie is so well made, well composed and absolutely beautiful that it really is a movie that stands on its own and have nothing to be compared to or rival it.Also the movie has some really good messages within it. About revenge, power of survival and human spirit, how cruel and raw nature can be. And it brings up how ""white man"" came to the wilds of America just to hunt for pelts to sell for money in the civilized world, and killed animals to near extinction. You can understand why the ""Indians,"" natives to those lands, wanted to kill them. Very harsh times and environment to be in.This movie really is amazing in how well made it is to every detail, it looks and feels so real, stunning expirence that I probably will come back to every now and then.

That is what might seem normal for people never experienced sub-freezing temperatures, but come on... He would have died after 5 minutes.The realism aside: the story is good. Following a man that has nothing getting his will by share resilience. I bet this was a novel with 1000+ pages."
" Unquestionably one of the most beautiful movies ever made...
",0.6361,0.7832,2020-02-14 00:00:00,8,"...and with its various components, also one of the most unique. The sets and costumes, and filth against the landscape, the exquisite photography and framing and choreography are reference material.
But it's the slavish long takes and the way they're stitched together that sometimes detracts from the flow, encouraging you to think more technically about it.
Tom Hardy is superb, a very different but equally good performance to DiCaprio as a proper balls to bone villain. Even though his mad babbling is brilliant, the film is neck deep in too much dialogue; The Revenant is a film where the esoteric imagery and stillness fight against the action and the obvious long takes and both fight against the hamfisted plot delivery and talking. It's a film that could have been excellent at one of those three things but with all of them in abundance, doesn't quite feel like an out of body experience, instead feels a lot like a well calculated man made movie.
DiCaprio's pain is palpable, the locations are blisteringly raw and untouched by humankind, and the final fight for revenge is like a video game QTE from the year 2045. It's memorable and epic and in many ways a masterpiece, but it's far from perfect."
" Brutally beautiful
",-0.0258,0.984,2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,"'The Revenant' is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and it is a true story set in the 1820s about a man named Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is about how Glass gets abandoned by his partners in the middle of the woods, severely injured, and how he throughout the entire movie, seeks revenge on the people who were responsible for abandoning him. That's about as much as I can say without spoiling too much.This movie was absolutely brutal, there were fight scenes that got me clenching to my seat in suspense, especially the climax of the movie. This movie was also extremely harrowing and emotional, and even more so when you know that it is based on a true story. There were rarely any happy moments or nicer moments where you could pause and relax because Glass' journey was not an easy one, it felt like nature was almost constantly against him.The acting in this movie was incredible, and it is also the movie where DiCaprio finally wins an Oscar, and he truly deserves it. His character is a man with few words, but the acting really shines with his body movement and facial expressions. Tom Hardy plays the antagonist, John Fitzgerald, and, though this isn't the best performance he has given, he does a great job here.Now let's talk about the cinematography. I'm immensely impressed by how beautiful this movie is. There were shots from this movie that I couldn't stop staring at, I was perplexed by how amazing everything looked. And the score for this movie also really emphasized the brilliance of the visuals. The moving camera and long shots that were frequently used were also impressive, and it really makes you feel like your running around with everybody else during the battle scenes. The CGI used in this movie was also incredible, at one point the movie features a bear, and it looks absolutely photorealistic.The only problem that I have with this movie is that the flashback scenes feel a bit confusing and messy, and sometimes the movie can feel a little boring, also due to its long runtime. But otherwise, this movie was superb and definitely worth the watch."

At least the plot of this film reaches a satisfying conclusion for all the different threads it pulls.
While DiCaprio may get the praise for his performance, Tom Hardy knocks it out of the park with his eerily psychotic portrayal. Overall, this film is definitely an Oscar contender on many fronts."

The story is simple, easy to follow but keeps you on edge. The characters are great and the movie really gives a lot of time for them to develop. The way the movie is filmed is my favourite part, all the long shots and the movement of the camera really bring the movie together. The movie may seem a bit slow to some people especially at the start but if you keep watching you are rewarded with a satisfying ending. My only problem is that some parts feel a bit repetitive, as the main character gets injured in some way and has to cope with it again and again. I gave this an 8/10 I highly recommend this to anyone."
" Raw representation of a father's love for his son
",0.6369,0.9824,2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"In The Revenant, Leo brings us an absolutely outstanding and painful embodiment of a father who will go to any length to avenge his son, the only thing left he cared about in this world.The Revenant takes us through his journey and, albeit somewhat unrealistic at times, the point of said journey was not to embody an episode of I Shouldn't Be Alive, but rather to capture his character's devotion to surviving against all odds for the sake of his son.With the wonderfully controlled plot along with the breathtaking cinematography and Leo's Oscar-winning performance, we get a great film often overlooked for its slow progression and long run time.Don't cut this one short, worth the watch!"

The plot is paper thin, followed by a slow-motion 90 minute chase scene, with a revenge climax.Here's the movie in four lines:
Trappers attacked by indians and survivors run
DeCaprio gets mauled by a bear and the man left to tend to him predicatably betrays him and kills man's son.
DeCaprio grunts agonisingly across the snowy landscape for 90 minutes
Kills man.The movie was drab from start to finish. All the flashback attempts at injecting depth were cliched and lacking in any depth whatsoever. I literally didn't care from start to finish if DeCaprio's character lived or died.
We were supposed to care about the plight of the indians, but any chance of that was ruined by the fact that other indians were also vicious psychos.
The only two remotely sympathetic chaaracters were the two youngsters, and arguably the one who survived.I think people confuse fantastic camerawork and incredible landscape for a good movie, but almost everything about this movie was ridiculous, and nothing more so, than the fact that in a sub-zero snow terrain, every single character seems to spend hours wading through icy swamps, stream and rivers wearing leather and furs, without so much as a shiver.Crappy, crappy piece of rubbish. Finally a DeCapio film I didn't like."

A balance between light and dark elements in not achieved. The main character becomes an action cliche due to the volume of certain death escapes.The Revenant is a case in ""less is more"". Tone down the violence, cut out a few inescapable situations, and we would be left in awe of nature's shear beauty."

",0.9382,-0.9318,2020-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Leo DiCaprio is excellent & Tom Hardy is excellent & both give outstanding performances in this gruelling survival drama.
The cinematography is gorgeous & the action is savage & bloody, the bear attack scene was the most realistic bear attack your ever likely to see in a movie ever!!!
Leo plays a scout tracker type of woodsman ""Hugh Glass"" who witnessed his son murdered by the psychotic ""Fitzgerald"" played by the always excellent Tom Hardy & here you will hate him, it's a mix of primal raw survival tale & a mission of vengeance through the unforgiving winter terrain of mountains & wild rivers & snow storms & Savage Indians as well as savage frontiersmen & hunters & wild bears as our survivor just keeps going with every breath getting closer.
It's an extremely wild ride & shows how brutal those times were for any race of people, I'm surprised anyone could survive during those dark times but they did.
""The Revenant"" is a journey & adventure during those extreme western frontier times, so it's a period piece drama also but mainly IT'S a film of a man who has lost everything & has nothing to lose so with a heart full of rage he seeks revenge for his murdered son. A bleak story but an important one with a realism that's brutally captured on film.
A fantastic survival film"

Leonardo DiCaprio definitely earned his Oscar for his portrayal frontiersman Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy deserves his nomination for his portrayal of John Fitzgerald (this character has got to be among the most evil and soulless characters in film history!)I feel that some of the negative reviews of this movie come from the fact that viewers want to pigeonhole this movie into either the category of adventure or action. Although it has plenty of both of the aforementioned elements, it is really a survival / justice movie. But in the end, it is just better not to try to pigeonhole this film which is much more complex than it appears on the surface.The scene where Hugh Glass is attacked and mauled by a bear is so graphic, it will make even the most seasoned movie watcher wince a bit. Not only is the CGI used for the bear incredible, but you can really feel the pain that Dicaprio's character is experiencing. However, this scene also is a part of the reason why I didn't give this movie a full 10: In reality, the injuries that the Glass character received from the bear attack (combined with all the other physical injuries he received throughout the film) would most likely resulted in his death. Or would have left him incapacitated to the point he would have died of exposure.This movie has no dull moments, and for me it seemed far less than its running time of 156 minutes, due to its intense pace.This film is a must-see saga for any serious movie

The main story can be explained in less than 30 seconds as there is no story.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson, Duane Howard, Arthur Redcloud, Kristoffer Joner, Lukas Haas, Brendan Fletcher, Melaw Nakehk'o, Vincent Leclerc. (R)Story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), real-life frontiersman guide who is horrifically mauled by a bear, witnesses the murder of his half-Pawnee son (Goodluck) at the hands of a trapper (Hardy), and is left for dead by the same man. The tenacity he uses to survive and persevere in the wilderness is rooted in an almost supernatural demand for vengeance--the title refers to someone who has come back from the dead with a dreadful purpose. A strikingly beautiful yet doggedly uncompromising film, dominated by Iñárritu's scorching but desolate vision, Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning photography (the untamed wild has rarely looked so gorgeous yet threatening at the same time), and DiCaprio's physical, mostly silent performance of a haggard obsessive who survives only for retribution (all three won Oscars for their work). A grueling experience at two-and-a-half hours where credibility is stretched at least one time too many for the sake of narrative convenience, but unforgettable no matter one's opinion. Loosely based on historical record, through the true story is even more amazing (if less dramatically satisfying) than the one on screen!87/100"

" The Revenant
",0.0,-0.9704,2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"The Revenant is a powerful movie heavily relying on determination and father/son relationship.The story is set in America during the 1820s. Due to an Indian attack, a colony has to manage to escape from the Indians' arrows, killing most of its men. While they search for a new settlement, Hugh Glass, a skilled hunter, gets attacked by a bear and is left highly injured. While keeping an eye on his bloody still-breathing corpse, the cold drives John Fitzgerald, member of the colony, hysterical and kills Glass' son, Hawk. The hunter's corpse left for dead, his determination and hunger for revenge keeps him from dying and will have to go though the wild cold of the America's mountains to accomplish his duty.The cast is composed with actors gifted with excellent acting skills. Leonardo DiCaprio, who won an Oscar for his performance, demonstrates the character's paternel love for his son and thirst of revenge on the one who murdered his own son. Talking about Fitzgerald, Tom Hardy portrays so well the mad colonist who wants to live on his own and get money, even killing on his way to obtain that American Dream. Domhnall Gleeson plays the serious and helpful colony's leader, and Will Poulter, the youth scared of the wilderness of America.This movie is incredibly beautiful. The shots of the mountains, rivers and forests, real of CGI, are breathtaking. The plot, even if it takes the idea of revenge, stills holds and you can really see Glass' development and recovery after his deadly battle. The costumes and makeup are realistic and the acting skills are incredible. Go watch this movie if you haven't already."

",0.0,0.9105,2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"First of all, excellent camera work: impressive immersive long takes, and who knows how they managed to physically move the camera along with the action so cleanly? However, that effort and technical skill was undermined by the amount of lens flare and lens moisture. In river scenes there's water droplets on the camera lens catching the light, in snowing scenes there's specs of snow. At one point, a close up on Leo's breath fogs up the lens. And the lens used is some sort of fish eye lens, making many scenes look unnatural - like you're viewing the events through a camera. Every time this happened it took me out of the film. It made me aware that a camera was being used to capture actors acting. I could imagine a camera man scrabbling around in the snow and the water and the dirt waiting for the scene to end so that he could wipe the lens with his lens cleaning cloth. Maybe the lenses used were particularly good at capturing action, but the downside was the lens flare and walleye vision? Maybe the lens flare was a deliberate choice?
By the middle of the film I was engaged enough in the plot to forget about the camera, but in the last quarter I became aware of the camera/cameraman/film crew/acting again. So I must have enjoyed the middle bit.Leo's character's surname is Glass and the camera lens is made of glass, and at the end Leo looks into the camera lens. Does that mean something? Is this irony? Are we all made of glass?"

The story of Revenant got some changes of course, but mainly it is the same story. The old one from 1971 is also a very good and entartaining one, so if you got time give that one a try too and compare both works."

The cold atmosphere, mixed in with the workers doing all they could to survive it. It's a film of survival, and all the things that you must fight to get to where you need to go.Leo plays a member of a group that is hunting bears to get their fur. They are attacked by Indians, and must flee. Only a few members are left, and they travel the cold winter climate to make it back home. Leo's character is wounded severely by a bear, and is eventually left behind by the group with a few others to take care of him. Those members eventually kill his son, and leave him for dead, though he pretty much is already dead anyways. The story then becomes a tale of Leo's character rebuilding himself, finding his way home, and hunting down the man who left him for dead.It's a really cold film. It's dark, and just freezing cold. But it's a Hollywood flick with a big actor. It cannot go those extreme places. It must adhere to all audiences, especially Leo DiCaprio audiences.

The plot is really simple and not much explored despite its length (around 2h30) and even some acting problems because of the lack of plot elements and excessive emotional distances presented for the characters, in such a way that I didn't personally get convinced of Di Caprios acting as Hawks father, except on the scenes that depict him as a kid in his village. Apart from that it felt like watching Rambo/Terminator like movies due to the craft of strong/appealing scenes in order to catch the viewers attention during this looong movie. Would say a film made just for Leonardo DiCaprio act during 2h30 and possibly win the Oscar - as he did. Not say the depiction of french as rapists, americans as men who work for their families and of the native americans as part of the scenario only.Besides the pointed not so great and worthy of any film prizes the strong points of this movie are its scenarios, camera work, photography, and atmosphere created that really pushes the viewer closer to the hardships experienced by its characters, which gives some substance to the movie.As Inarritu did before with Birdman - also a film crafted for Oscar Awards community - I would say he masters the hacks and drills to direct the movies to win this prize and that's it."
" 9/10
",0.0,0.9423,2019-09-20 00:00:00,9,"On a technical level, it is virtually perfect. The cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and camera movements all contribute to a full-sensory immersive experience.
DiCaprio, Hardy, Poulter, Gleeson, among others, all give great performances.
The film constantly explores the strength of man (both spiritual and physical), as well as the connection between man and nature, and the depiction of man as just another species in the animal kingdom (especially notable in a climatic sequence towards the end of the film).
The film perfectly balances technical agility and transcendental tone in a way that is both brutal and poetic."

",-0.3182,0.8532,2019-08-17 00:00:00,6,"I've heard nothing but good things about The Revenant, especially regarding the cinematography. However, upon watching it, I was shocked by some of the terrible wide-angle lens choices. This lead a number of the scenes having distortion which completely pulled me out of the scenes. This is a shame, because other than that the camera work was solid. I usually wouldn't nitpick about something so small but, unfortunately, other than the visual aspect of the film, it didn't have much else going on.Leo did a wonderful job, as did the rest of the cast, but it wasn't enough to hold my interest through the two and a half hour run-time. This isn't because I don't like slowly paced films about people, I do, I just found the story a little simple for such a long run-time. I have no problem with a two and a half hour character driven film, but it needs some complexity to justify it. Apologies to the filmmakers, but I don't find a man crawling and stumbling around the woods for over an hour to be especially gripping storytelling. The only reason I can think of for this film being as needlessly long as it was, was to show off the stunning landscapes in which it was filmed.Had the movie been shorter, it would have been much better. There were some scenes, one in particular with a bear, that dragged on so absurdly long that it could pass for a parody of itself.The Revenant is neither a spectacular film nor a horrible film, it's fine. Just fine. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for an interesting character driven drama, check out something like Nightcrawler instead."

" Gorgeous with good performances
",0.7845,0.9541,2019-07-28 00:00:00,9,"A gorgeous and well-acted movie with weaknesses. Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant. Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic. Using haunting and powerful strains of music that at times echo Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Inarritu enhances the movie's lengthy edits without dialogue. Revenant has many similarities to another stunning survival movie, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) and the epic western, Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves that won best movie Oscars twenty-five years ago."
" Simply Breathtaking!!!!

I can only say, just watch it, its brilliant.
Its a story about survival and revenge shot in the most beautiful surroundings, with a beautiful soundtrack.
Leonardo dicaprio won an oscar for his role in this movie and its hard to say if the oscar was deserved or if it was because he was nominated several times before and didn't get an oscar.
But he does play his part really well.
The only downside of this movie is that it does get a little boring from time to time and feels a little stretched in certain scenes.
Because of that it didn't get a 9/10 but an 8 but still a beautiful movie that i will watch again and again in the coming years."

There is hardly any story, no connection with protagonist, excruciatingly slow pace, and absolutely no direction where movie is heading. I mean, I had to force myself to finish this and would not have missed anything had I abandoned it. Utterly forgettable. Pathetically boring."
" DiCaprio CAN act when he wants to
",0.0,0.4618,2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"One of the worst bits of acting I ever saw was DiCaprio as King Louis Quatorze in ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" But then, one of the better bits of acting I have seen was DiCaprio as a man who gets mauled by a bear, watches his son get killed, falls off a cliff with his horse and then has to use the animal as a bivouac ... and so forth. Only reality can bring on such a series of life- and sanity-threatening events, and yet a human being is strong enough to survive and make it back to civilization, such as it is.The film tries to be ultra-realistic with settings, costuming, and language, and it mostly succeeds very well. The generally excellent camerawork is marred by a few strange choices. For example, when characters are breathing heavily in the cold, there is condensation on the camera lens (more likely, on a glass plate held in front of the camera!). If this is to elicit a 'documentary feel,' well, that would work if the movie were set in 1933, when Technicolor film cameras existed, but not in 1823. Pretending there was a camera catching real life in 1823 actually has the opposite effect: it takes you out of the story thinking what I just said above, and that diminishes the experience of the film.Not perfect in all respects, but very worth seeing for those who can handle harsh violence, scalping, (simulated) distress and death of animals, and so forth."
" Fake history
",-0.4767,-0.9673,2019-07-09 00:00:00,1,"The people who run Hollywood have a stake in re-writing history in ways that benefit them. Alas, that means our ancestors will be portrayed within a narrative that is fake and seeks to perpetuate certain myths, which, in turn, are used to achieve political goals. If you are not tired of the narrative about evil Europeans who bring misery to noble Indians, you might want to waste over two hours of your life. The only reason this film is that long, apparently, is the writers' desire to make the protagonist endure every calamity they could imagine. He survives a bear attack, a fall down a massive waterfall in icy water, being fired upon a million times, jumping off a cliff Rambo style, surviving for hours without warm clothes by recreating a scene from Empire Strikes Back, and finally being stabbed several times with a knife. He is a mix of Rambo and John McLane. The whole thing is strangely comical. Finally, the film is disappointing in terms of emotional payoff. I felt nothing. What a waste."

" my notes
",0.0,0.9878,2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"AMAZING. This is what I consider to be art. This movie might have the best cinematography I've ever seen, and some of the most beautiful shots I've ever laid eyes on. I think I could have taken a screenshot about 500 times during the movie and framed it, no exaggeration. And the directing stood out to me so much in this movie, I kept wondering who made this? there were so many times where a scene had nothing happening in it and yet I was still in awe of the direction and cinematography. and you have the acting, two absolutely outstanding performances by two of my all-time favorite actors.other than that, this was one of the most intense and real-feeling movies I've ever watched. there were so many scenes where I was on the edge of my seat, or squirming, or clenching my fists. gut-wrenching is a good description. and it wasn't just that it was overly violent, I've seen much worse (ie Hostel). but the fact that I was actually feeling what they were feeling shows how well those scenes were done.I also thought they did a great job with using almost no music in certain scenes which made it feel much more real. And that's saying a lot since I absolutely love when a great song is used to make an awesome scene more intense. and there were many times when this didn't feel like a movie at all.another thing that made it feel real was how some of the big events started with no warning or build-up. for example, the bear attacks Glass immediately after we first notice it hiding behind the bushes. in regular movies, we would first notice it, then it would zoom in on his face, then the bear would stand up and roar, and music would start playing, then the bear would attack. the way it was done in this movie just hit you hard and fast.another example is during the final battle when glass chops off two of Fitzgerald's fingers. it was so quick. I feel like in regular movies he would've chopped them, then they would zoom in on the hand and show his chopped fingers, then show him holding his hand in front of his face, screaming.I like how they not only showed but made you feel how hard life must've been back then in the lawless land of the west.downsides, it could have been shorter, and I thought some of the imagery in the dreams didn't really pan out to anything tangible. I thought they would play more of a role in telling the story.Also, I don't really consider this a downside , but the story really was nothing special overall. but this shows how you can take a regular story and make it amazing with great acting, directing, and cinematography (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
the opening scene, the bear scene, and the final battle were three of the most intense and amazing scenes I've watched. and there were many other smaller moments that were jaw-dropping, like when he fell off the cliff on a horse. there were also a few long shots that look like they were done in one take, similar to what he did in Birdman. and the bear scene looks so real that it makes me question all past CGI scenes I've watched and makes me wonder if they actually looked as real as this"
" A truly gripping masterpiece.
",0.7906,-0.7457,2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Dicaprio is a talented actor for sure. He was awesome in Titanic, funny in Catch Me If You Can, hilarious in Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, and, to be honest, weird in Romeo and Juliet. But of all of those movies, and possibly all of the others I haven't seen, this is my favorite.I was expecting some average western with a cliche ending. Bad guy dies, good guy lives on. Constant gunfights and fake looking action. But it was so much more than that. The movie was a somewhat fictionalized movie about a historic fur trapper who gets attacked by a bear and left for dead. The only thing keeping him alive is his craving for revenge against the man who ruined his life. I can understand why Leo won an oscar for his portrayal of Glass.This movie is gripping from the minute it starts. The action and drama is almost non-stop. Just like Shawshank, I completely underestimated this movie. I'm offended that it didn't make it to the top 250. Definitely a cult-classic in the running."

Iñárritu is back with The Revenant after the masterpiece that was Birdman and this is one of the most stunning films I've seen.Iñárritu returns with a brutal revenge drama set in the 1800s where we see Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) trying to find the man who left him for dead.Hands down, this is one of the most visually breathtaking films you will ever see. The choice of utilising natural lighting instead of studio lights really paid off. The gorgeous cinematography is amazing to look upon and full immerses you into this world. DiCaprio delivers a phenomenal performance as Hugh Glass and his expressions fully convey the pain he's going through. He definitely deserved that Oscar. Tom Hardy is amazing as the selfish and despicable Fitzgerald. Not for one moment do you think of the actors during this movie as they're so believable as these characters.You can tell Iñárritu was very passionate about this project since his direction and choice of shots are incredible. He uses a lot of long shots, especially during the intense action scenes, to really portray the rawness and realism of this world. There are some scenes in the movie which I have literally no idead how the crew did it. The violence is very brutal but not over the top in any way. Iñárritu makes the violence seem convincing through his long shots and not shying away from any of the brutalilty shown. The costumes and makeup are very fitting for the time period which further adds to the realism.My only problem is that the plot is predictable and the runtime is a bit too long but the impressive cinematography, direction and acting makes up for it for me to say this is one of the best revenge survival films made. I praise everyone who contributed to this film as it is something to be proud of.I definitely recommend this movie! This is something that cannot be missed."

It's so nice to get big films like this which make a historical setting and all it entails... feel real. You feel like you are in this time period. Everything about this film looks amazing and is shot masterfully. Leonardo Decaprio's acting is amazing, as is Tom Hardy's own performance. There's several stirring sequences and themes that are hard hitting. However, this film drags on and outstays its welcome. It's sluggish pace goes past world-building and into excess. By the time, the final confrontation is happening, you just wish it would be over. At least, I did. It can also be ridiculously over the top. It's first battle which is a one-take would be impressive it it wasn't just one person getting backstabbed and then backstabbed by another for five minutes straight. The terrifying grizzly bear sequence just keeps going, and so does the last fight scene. Movies need to know when to end and how to pace themselves. And this film does not. Despite those gripes, I feel giving this film anything less than 8 is a disservice, even if I didn't not much enjoy it. The director, the cinematographers, and the actor's truly made this film."
" Inarritu's Acheivement Will Be Hard To Duplicate

DiCaprio and Hardy are phenomenal. The plot revolves around a frontiersman who suffers severe injuries during a vicious bear attack. His hunting partner shoots his partner's son and kills him. After recovering from his wounds with some assistance the frontiersman, utilizing his legendary tracking and survival skills, hunts down his partner on his way back to civilization to seek vengeance for his partner's betrayal. The plot is intense, brutal, captivating, unparalleled, insightful and has a cathartic ending. It's a one of a kind film that is mesmorizing throughout the entirety without barely a word spoken. I've never seen anything like it before. The film does an outstanding job examining man's will to survive and scrutinizing how far human beings will go to enact vengeance. I doubt any artist will ever be able to duplicate or achieve what Inarritu has done. This film sticks with the viewer long after it's ending. Congratulations to DiCaprio for finally achieving a much deserved Best Actor Oscar which he should have won a few times over. It's one of the very best films ever in it's genre."

Leonardo DiCaprio won a long awaited best actor Oscar three years ago for his excellent performance as Hugh Glass a frontiersman and fur trapper on an expedition in the extremely cold wilderness in the early 1820's and his group of other trappers includes John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as well as Captain Andrew Henry (Dohmnall Gleeson) among others. After we get to know the characters a little bit we see Glass in the woods by himself hunting for animals and finds a bear that ends up mauling him to the point where he's so badly beaten up that he nearly dies and is left for dead by his own fellow trappers. After Glass wakes up and discovers this he sets out for revenge against those who betrayed him. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the finest performance I've ever seen from him in a movie for a role which he went all out in preparation for and totally deserved that Oscar for, Tom Hardy is also very good here and got a well deserved best supporting actor nomination as a result. The acting is strong, the direction is very good, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is nothing short of breathtaking. The only thing I would say about this movie that I had a problem with was that at points in the film it seemed a little drawn out with DiCaprio's mission to seek revenge on those who left him for dead but it is also understandable because it's his movie. The movie was actually filmed in the harsh weather conditions that are actually seen throughout its over two and a half hour runtime. Iñárritu is without a doubt one of the best directors of the last twenty years and part of the great Hollywood trio of Mexican filmmakers along with Alfonso Cuaron and Guillermo del Toro, and so far out of the three films I've seen that Iñárritu directed not one was bad. This is one of 2015's very best films."

I think, the bravery and faith of The Revenant is far beyond my power to understand his commitment to love plus his family, particularly his boy...
To create a picture which can take you out there to be a part of the story is the other sense of this high qualified man made art which, the director was successful in it, I, myself could feel myself in the cold weather, in the forest that is certainly death ...and fighting death is impossible ...before this amazing story, I thought our fate is set and no one is able to change it, and we should wait for the time to arrive and drown us in itself....but now I acquired this ability that our future is not set and by having faith and being optimistic, everything is possible, specially, rising as a dead man to become alive and retake what you had before..."

Arrogantly long (in order to show off the acting, effects, and cinematography), blatantly manipulative in the portrayal of victimized Native Americans, blatantly manipulative with the whole 'bear mauling' incident, a redundant theme of prolonged struggle - you name the Oscar cliche, and this film hits them all.At the end of the day, the best test of a film is ""Do I enjoy watching this film?"" No one enjoys watching 'The Revenant' . People may tell you they enjoyed it, because they wanted to enjoy it, and they have a need to stay consistent with their past selves. Those people are weak minded, and probably still listen to the same music they listened to in high school. Trust me - this movie is garbage to pacify critics.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

An intense movie with some of the best cinematography imaginable and a phenomenal performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.The action scenes are very well done, especially the bear scene (that CGI tho). The action in this movie is actually pretty impressive. Its use of long takes, expertise cuts and camera angles, and great visuals makes each of them stand out."

But they went way over the top trying to make it good. They added a bunch of fictional elements that were not only unnecessary, but which actually made the movie worse.If only they'd stuck to the original story I think this movie could have been much better. As it was, a lot of the stuff came across as very corny. The special effects and cartoon bear sort of ruined it for me. However, I will say that the cinematography was very good. There was some stuff that I had no idea how they did it. All the same though, they ruined a great story with this one. Do no recommend."

What the picture lacks is a complex story. The story we are presented just doesn't hold up to scrutiny, somehow managing to be unexplored and overstretched and managing to squeeze logical inconsistencies together with amazingly realistic scenes.Take the relationship between Glass and his son; you're telling me there wasn't time to explore this in 160+minutes of screen time? Except for in the hokey dream sequence scenes of the movie that have to be the weakest part and an obvious crutch. Apart from that, having the ""villain"", presumably illiterate, break into a strong safe just to be followed by only 2 men is a weak writing crutch.Altogether a good movie, but I would argue Iñarritu's worst so far."
" Take with a pinch of salt ...
",0.0,0.1751,2019-04-11 00:00:00,7,"An engrossing drama ! To start with, the merciless face of the Nature, the panoramas etc. inspire an awe. The way the camera moves from each character's view is subtly impressive. The characters are played impeccably by the actors - Hardy as the selfish and ruthless 'Fitzgerald', the dutiful 'Captain Henry' by Gleeson and the die-hard 'Glass' by Caprio. The background score is above average.
While it's a thrilling work,
one cannot ignore it's numerous faults. First of all, the gross historical inaccuracies and unjust liberties taken, followed by limited display of survival skills(evisceration survival scene appreciated!). Then comes the monotonous illusions(hallucinations) that Glass suffers. It would have been better to create a pure, factually solid survival film rather than a revenge drama intertwined with survival - a serious viewer would often get exasperated e.g: While I was wondering how a near-dead Glass manages to navigate and heal his wounds, I was disturbed by either his hallucinations or some seemingly practical escape from his opponents. How captain Henry makes to fort Kiowa is another mystery. How all the tribes speak the same language, what horses eat in that barren land and many such questions could have been covered in its 2h 36min. run but the scriptwriter and the director didn't seem to have a precise focus.
While it's an absorbing film, watch it with a pinch of salt ..."

Bear with me...I could list various other Oscar travesties, though one of the biggest, at least until 2016, was that Leonardo DiCaprio had never won an Oscar. Regardless of what else you might think of this film, it is thanks to The Revenant that he does now have one.Why did I just spend two paragraphs rabbiting on about the Oscars and not about The Revenant? Because I literally can't think of anything else nice to say about it. Sure, the scenery's great, the fact that only natural lighting was used is a fun fact to know at parties I suppose.

Pure magnificence. Clean and pure images of nature being nature: a cruel indomitable mistress. The photography was, unfortunately, mostly padding. It had moments it was necesary, but most of the time it felt just like padding.The story is solid, with a lot artistic licenses (i.e. lies) over the real tale, but in general the plot and story are solid, but have a problem: they are easily forgotten. You have no idea of the time passing between scenes because the movie refuses to tell you and a revenge tale like this really required to track the time better.The acting was amazing, although I found the weakest being Poulter (seriously, how do you get work?) followed by DiCaprio. Tom Hardy ate Fitzgerald And Gleeson was born to be Henry. I am not saying DiCaprio do not deserve an Oscar, but this movie was not the reason he deserved it. If you give me rotten meat to eat i could vomit too, where is my Oscar? He deserves it for other movies (I adored him in the Departed and it was the greatest actor in Titanic), but not this one.In short: Entertaining, well done, beautiful movie that you will forget the moment you see any other movie with a plot.

When there's action, it is massively brutal, very bloody, dirty and descriptive. There's not a lot to laugh about in this movie, it's depressing and mentally almost as exhausting for the viewer as for the actors, people involved in making this and for the characters being portrayed.
The awards it won are likely deserved (I won't look up nominees now). But the categories it won in sum up fairly well how much effort went into the production, which is, no doubt, outstanding. The props, costumes and settings make it look very realistic.
The plot is decently good, it's just, as previously stated, very draggingly narrated with a lot of focus on camera work and capturing moments in an artful way."

" Stunning visuals, tense action
",0.0516,-0.9873,2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"""The Revenant"" is a visual and visceral triumph. There are magnificent landscapes, rushing rivers, raging waterfalls, brilliant skies. You truly feel enveloped by nature and sense the constant struggle that the main character, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), endures as he battles the harsh elements. Nature puts Glass, an experienced fur trapper, through a lot, but his fellow man turns out to be far more vicious. DiCaprio's performance as Glass is truly grueling; he has relatively little dialogue (mostly because he's struggling to survive), but he transmits every emotion in the book as he endures agonizing physical and emotional pain, and ultimately, spiritual enlightenment. ""The Revenant"" has some tense, well-staged action scenes amid spectacular scenery and set to a lush symphonic score. Tom Hardy is pure evil as vicious trapper Fitzgerald, Glass' enemy and the object of his vengeance. Hardy's and DiCaprio's scenes together fairly crackle as these two characters battle it out in some epic fight scenes. Some of the dialogue and plot is hard to follow, perhaps because the film goes for authenticity over clarity in some aspects. However, it offers stark beauty and at times, dreadful terror."
" A gorgeous and well-acted movie with weaknesses.
",0.3612,0.9349,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"19 January 2016. Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant. Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic. Using haunting and powerful strains of music that at times echo Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Inarritu enhances the movie's lengthy edits without dialogue. Revenant has many similarities to another stunning survival movie, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) and the epic western, Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves that won best movie Oscars twenty-five years ago.Yet unlike more personally and sustain intensity of the true to life survival film, Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void (2003, there are plot weaknesses throughout the movie that mildly detract from the movie's rhythm and authenticity. There is a scene beautifully shot from high above a river and yet realistically the actual path to the river seems impossibly difficult to navigate as that point in the movie. There isn't any actual shot of the use of flint in making an actual fire. And likely another in an extremely cold river would have died within minutes of hypothermia. The death scene of a single Indian seems unlikely when the white man survives nearby. And any person trying to avoid being tracked is also a fool to walk in a visually stunning scene in the middle of an open and barren now field. Finally it is unlikely a manhunt as choreographed in The Revenant would have unfolded so blatantly easily as it did.A major problem with this movie is how the director pushes the limits of artistic presentation over the storyline. Sean Penn's survival movie, Into The Wild (2007) is a good example where the director's fantastic camera eye for beauty begins to transform into the foreground of the movie's plot, and here in The Revenant falling into a tree scene is one glaring example of overkill towards unbelievability. The last problem with this movie is its ending which is overly extended and the Indian women's character development and role in the movie is severely minimized to the point that a most poignant redemption ending is lost and overlooked.The Revenant deserves best acting, cinematographic awards, but it can't quite offer the completeness for best movie."

You get to see and feel the emotions, pain and hope of these people.The acting is outstanding, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. He plays ""Hue Glass"" and experiences so much prolonged pain and suffering that he becomes more than a man who 'has tasted death without dying'.Once he is betrayed and his comrad takes everything away from him - including his life, or so it seems - Glass sets out on the long, painful, and lonely journey to seek revenge.DiCaprio portrays this struggle of survival perfectly.

Not much, I'm afraid. Survival and revenge are basic instincts, and this was a basic film, although pretty. The over-the-top bleakness did bring some unintentional laughs, though.

The action takes place against a bleak wintery landscape. The violence between Indians and fur trappers is grim right from the beginning with quite a high death toll in the first 30 minutes of this excessively long film. The violence is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of this kind of conflict in cinema history. Sadly, the characters are rather one dimensional and we can't really warm to any of them. There's no humour or light relief anywhere to be had. It's a film I would watch only once."

Nonetheless, DiCaprio's perseverant and relentless Hugh Glass is a worthy winner of an Oscar - which should have really been awarded for his sublime performance in Django Unchained.Afterthought: Had to watch the film in subtitles as Hardy is very difficult to understand.

It misses greatness because the ending takes too long and is not quite right - it's a pulp novelist's ending rather than a film maker's, a little bit pretentious and unsatisfying.

Even the landscapes are inaccurate based on where the real Hugh Glass was. As an fictional action-adventure piece for the masses I think it does pretty well even though it stretches incredibility to impossibility in many of the scenes.My greatest worry is it sets up for the next generation silly Indian/trapper stereotypes. For example, the depiction of mountain men and/or trappers as being totally helpless and defenseless in the great outdoors - nothing could be further from the truth. A muzzle loading single shot hand gun cannot be fired several times in rapid succession from horseback. And in that era the Indians never attacked a trapper camp of that size - they didn't have the manpower and they couldn't afford the casualties. Otherwise -- enjoy the movie."

He pulls excellent performances from a rather broad cast - both marquee stars and first-time bit players - including a raw, gritty, mostly-isolated show from Leo Dicaprio that finally got him over the hump and into the Best Actors' club. The choice to use all-natural light goes a long way, too, giving the screen a unique look that genuinely feels frostbitten and miserable.A tough, morally-gray tale of vengeance and persistence, man versus nature and man versus man, that'll stick with you for days.

In the true story of Hugh Glass, there was no pawnee son, no burial, and no one died. Glass only pursued Fitzgerald through anger of his desertion. Had the film remained faithful to the original story, it would have felt far less hollywood-esque, and would have been a courageous attempt at a different kind of revenge story.
The cinematography, the sets, and the costumes remain beyond phenomenal, but there was something they missed in the plot."

I loved the scenery in the film, it really was spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass who is like an explorer back in 1823. He has a half cherokee son. He is left for dead after being attacked by a huge bear and his group doesn't want him to slow him down.
Tom Hardy is a villian in the film. Then he goes on a very eventful journey of self survival. He really goes through very harsh weather and gets pushed to his limits. I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. Leonardo plays this part so well, in my opinion he was 100 percent deserving of the oscar. One of his best roles!"

Personally I do not like CGI because CGI does not look realistic and indeed looks animated. If you are seeking a movie true to facts, but may not be as visually stimulating then watch ""Man In The Wilderness"". It's pretty much that simple. Hollywood has lost their imagination so instead of coming up with new movie ideas, they just continue to remake old movies again and again and focusing on CGI.

" The Revenant - Review
",0.0,0.9763,2018-10-06 00:00:00,9,"The Revenant - an American biographical movie in western background in a wintry climate, which is also played as a character, happening in 1820's. Hugh Glass played by Leonardo DiCaprio is about a man who survived from a grizzly bear attack and survived to take revenge on his son's death. One of the recent films The Revenant is with a higher artistic level and strong effort of visual storytelling methods with least dialogues in the cold background with cold hearted characters. Mind blowing cinematography mention's the name of Emmanuel Lubezki's in wide through a zero lighting technique in the digital era.
At first, it's a peak for Alejandro González Iñárritu's directorial venture after giving a movie like Birdman. Here, this as a masterpiece of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, which let him to bag him an Oscar. This film has Leo, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter as main characters to portray the novel with the same name. It starts with a hunter's point of view to hunt down preys and soon himself become a prey. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Mark Smith had done an applauded script to portray the life of Hugh Glass to expel the pain and sorrow of the lost of his only son who got saved once before by himself from a life threatening event. While talking about Leonardo's dedication he deserves more than awards as recognition for this movie.
As a director Alejandro's did justifiable work, in a scene like buried spot escape need some more explanation and information. Tom Hardy is always never given up on his roles; again this is a milestone for his performance as Fitsgerald. In climax as a convict he did a convincing performance and personally as a fan of Hardy, he and the entire team deserves a strong consideration and recognition for presenting such a movie with a high artistic level."

This movie did not disappoint in that regard. It was gritty and believable (sort of--Hugh's legend received a couple embellishments) with beautiful cinematography and top-notch acting.It was also not a surprise. I first learned of Hugh Glass in junior high. When The Revenant came out, it instantly went to the top of my must-see list. Because Hugh's story is of one man's struggle for survival in the wilderness, I knew it had to have a lot of scenes with only one actor. And it did. But those scenes could have been tightened up a lot. Two and a half hours is a long time for a movie in which very few things actually happened and the things that do happen you mostly expect.

Amazing cast and amazing acting. There is nothing to mark on that. Just a-m-a-z-i-n-g.There is just two little things to note. First of all 
The storyline is actually good but it can seem a bit simple because the whole movie (and it's 2h 36min long) is about Glass getting his revenge on Fitzgerald for killing his son and leaving him behind to die. Now don't get me wrong. There are a lot movies with the same kind of concept but what's different about The Revenant is that A) Glass is trying to get his revenge while almost dying a zillion times and still making it out alive and because he get's injured in the process he is crawling to get to Fitzgerald and his revenge. Literally. He is crawling. B) the movie is hecka long.But other than that the movie is marvellous and the fight scenes are flawless.I also really enjoyed the ending which is a rare experience. 9.5 stars because of the two little complaints."

" Outstanding, But Brutal, Extreme Violence In Leonardo DiCaprio's Revenge Western (Based On The True Events Of Hugh Glass)
",-0.9136,0.9969,2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Survival and revenge are two terms to describe this exhilarating and wonderful masterpiece directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. The Revenant is a 2015 Western (at least I think it is in my own opinion) film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Set back in 1823, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his Pawnee son named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) are a part of Andrew Henry's (Domhnall Gleeson) trappers. After Glass gets mauled by a grizzly bear, he is left extremely injured. However, everything changes when a fellow trapper named John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) kills Glass' son Hawk. Looking to avenge his son's murder, Glass sets out to travel miles and miles to get to Fitzgerald. Let's not forget that he also has to travel through the shivering cold and the snowy terrain.I can't even believe that this movie is based on true events. If someone had to go through in what Glass went through in this movie, they would die instantly. As to the extreme violence, this two and a half hour movie shows pain and suffering throughout the whole entire movie. I would also definitely not recommend the Revenant to any young kids, because the violence is just way over the top. Despite the violence, this movie is extremely great and has many different advantages in how satisfying it is. The casting, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, did a phenomenal job on each of their characters. The director, who is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, provided a surprising lead in direction while never standing down. By the way, the filming and the making of this movie was pretty tough. The weather conditions they filmed it in and the snowy terrain obviously made it harder. Even some of the crew members quit, because of how difficult it was. On the other hand, one of the most terrific experiences in this movie was the beautiful cinematography! Emmanuel Lubezki also provided an extremely great touch in filming this movie. However, there is so much great subjects about this movie and it is awesome! I give credit to the cast for their outstanding performances in their characters, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for his amazing direction, and Emmanuel Lubezki for his beautifully shot scenery on the Revenant. This truly was an amazing picture, but also extremely tough.For everyone who has seen this movie, we all know that this movie is off the charts in violence. It's brutal and that's all I have to say about that. However, I loved this movie! The plot line was not only an interesting story, but it was also based on true events! Does Hugh Glass make it to Fitzgerald? Does Glass ever survive in the wilderness? Watch (or at least try to) the Revenant to find out what happens. I give the Revenant a 10 out of 10 for its extremely great plot, casting, direction, and filming! Everything about this movie was fantastic!The Revenant: Won 3 Oscars - Best Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), and for Best Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki)Short Note: I just started my IMDb channel!

I mean sure there's a story, but somehow one that was so fantastical, so remote from the actions of the characters that I didn't ever connect the two so didn't feel any emotional attachment to it. Even the bear scene was the tour-de-force of film-making that everyone says while also making me have absolutely no concern for Glass.Take the opening attack, and compare it to the attack on the convoy leaving the fort in Last of the Mohicans. The latter gives you a much better sense of the geography of the action, even when they go off to the river and are chased down; this all gives the scene a distinct sense of peril. The characters might not make it. Not so in The Revenant. Even with the quite common chance of death, as people start dropping from arrows and hatchets, it all feels remote, cold, isolated. And confusing. Warriors coming from off the frame to kill someone doesn't seem frightening, so much as confusing."

Films like Fury, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, and this film has acting which fails to account for the times in which they are set.The manner of speaking, the worldview, their reason, and their nature is still in the 21st century and it's very distracting to a viewer who knows better.Tom Hardy's character is terrible. (And I like Tom Hardy) He sounds and acts like a man you would meet in rural Missouri today. The English isn't archaic enough across the board. That goes for all the actors.Also, the little speech by the Indian discussing with the French how they've stolen so much land... This is South Dakota in the 1820s! Ok? There were barely any Indians much less European settlements out there. (Especially by the French!). It was large wide open territory with few people per sq acre. You could walk for days without seeing another living person! To this day barely anyone lives there! And the Indian nations that did exist we're still autonomous! In another scene, Tom Hardy talks about Texas Rangers! In the 1820s! Texas wasn't even independent yet!Please, if they're going to make these kind of films they need to drop the pretense of the modern mind and not only take the time to learn about the setting, but the actors need to do some research into the speech, worldview, and culture of the times. This isn't camp. If they're going to try hard to make a serious film, hit all the marks."

The bear attack was phenomenal and so real I nearly screamed out loud and I've never done that at any movie, ever.
The attempts to save each other, when to run, when to not attempt to save others, all these things caused you to put yourself in their shoes and that's what I love in a story.

The movie chronicles his survival and his quest for revenge.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has created brilliant scenes within the elements of nature. He is greatly aided by cinematographer Emmanuel Lukezki. The many aerial vistas (filmed in southern Argentina and the western regions of Canada and the U.S.) reward the eyes and there is great excitement in battle scenes and the now famous and unforgettable scene involving a grizzly bear. The filmmakers can also be credited for keeping the viewers' interest during all of its 2.5 hours.At one point, I found it too hard to accept that one man (Glass) could withstand so much and not only survive but even thrive at times. After some research, I learned that the events of the first half of the film are indeed true but the second half was fictionalized for dramatic purposes.In a very unusual performance, DiCaprio deserves credit for a film in which he is mostly silent. There are moments of intense emotion with his great struggles and he can definitely elicit sympathy in his silence.""The Revenant"" is certainly a good film overall but probably not worthy of all the awards it received. It is yet one of many macho movies galore. It is very skilled but it does not advance the genre."

" Men in the wilderness revenge drama
",-0.5267,-0.1406,2018-05-09 00:00:00,7,"An American Western; A story about a frontiersman leading a hunting party through the wilderness. Mauled by a bear, he is badly injured. A travelling companion who pledged to stay with him betrays him. Against all odds, the wounded man goes on a gruelling quest for revenge through a harsh landscape.
It's a straightforward revenge drama heightened by a succession of escape sequences and survival thrills giving way to a John Woo style ending. What is gained by being immersed in a time and a place and a setting is sometimes lost to poorly performed diction by way of mumbling Southern drawl, and occasional stagy acting. DiCaprio gave an arresting performance as a Wyoming mountain man under duress and pain, but at times he overcommits. The actor Oliver Reed once recalled Peter Cushing's advice on how an actor should convey pain: no need for pained expression because conveying the suppression of pain is more dramatic in effect.
All in all, this is superb escapism thanks to beautiful cinematography, stunning locations, and masteful direction, but for a film of such scale it is a forgettable film due to its very predictable storyline."

" An unmissable experience.
",0.0,-0.9828,2018-04-15 00:00:00,8,"If ""The Revenant"" doesn't contribute in some way to revitalising the Western genre, it is likely nothing ever will. The film is a remarkable experience; an example of what happens when each and all of the various aspects of film-making - original soundtrack; cinematography; second unit direction; imagery, etc. - fuse together as effectively as perhaps they are able to in order to deliver something quite extraordinary. ""The Revenant"" unfolds in a place inherently dreary, yet somehow beautiful at the same time; takes place in a setting absolutely deadly, yet possesses a strange tranquillity to it. Mostly every scene or sequence is bookended by a magnificent composition of a mountain or a skyline of trees which you sense might succeed as an award winning photograph all by itself. It takes place in a world drenched in war; hurt; pain; loss and cynical opportunism (you can practically feel the grief dripping off the screen as to watch it), and while it is entirely its own film, somehow manages to draw on the best from other works of its sort (which range from ""Into the Wild"" and ""Apocalypto"" to Terrence Malick) in order to supplement the experience it's delivering to you. Primarily, Alejandro Iñárritu's film is about the bourgeoning conflict between two men which then erupts into a tale of revenge as one goes after the other in the wake of a murder. One of these men is Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is guiding a troupe of (mostly) American fur-trappers to a fort through the barren winter wilderness of where the United States appears to meet Canada. Glass, mistrusted by some of the crew as to having previously lived with the indigenous peoples of this terrain, and having previously apparently shot an allied soldier, is already grieving the death of his wife and the destruction of his village some years ago at the hands of the French Colonialists. His infant son, however, survived and now travels with him.The simplicity of Glass' exercise is complicated by an ambush they suffer by a group of Native American Indians: an event which forces the trappers downstream and deeper into the hostile wilderness from which they entrust Glass can guide them. Not interested in seventy year old stereotypes, Iñárritu bothers to cut back to the Indians who reveal themselves to be searching for the kidnapped daughter of the enraged chief and are therefore allowed an extra dimension. We actually want them to find her.""The Revenant"" then completely changes gears when, inexplicably, it has its protagonist attacked by a grizzly bear to the extent that it very nearly kills him. What set out as a, and certainly would have been decades ago, somewhat standard adventure story of a lost group of people evading Indians and bandits (Mexicans; the French, etc.) through untamed North America ends up as something very different. Space here is limited as to the extent I want to get across just how impressed with ""The Revenant"" I really was. What struck me the most was the way the film subverted the traditional action-movie character arc in BEGINNING with its lead in the worst possible state (bloodied and beaten) before only later becoming ready for the climactic 'showdown' when they are able-bodied. It is in the aftermath of the bear attack that two volunteers remain behind to care for him, as the rest of the trappers press on to the fort. One of these is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald - a mumbling, grizzled Texan with money problems who has his own reasons for hating Indians. Iñárritu uses a combination of techniques to disguise the eventual conflict between the two men as mere small talk amidst a platoon of men just wanting to get back to base with their scalps intact. When the first 'shot' of the film rings out, it is from Glass' rifle and the film cuts quite deliberately to Hardy's character reacting to it in the far distance - their binary natures are then established when it is revealed Fitzgerald only wants to save the 'pelt' skins they have accumulated on the expedition, while Glass tries to rescue as many fellow trappers as possible following the Indian raid. Later, we witness verbal conflict on-board the escape-barge and then over Glass' son's ethnicity - were it not for the captain, who has authority over both of them and has already asserted it over Fitzgerald on the barge via an exchange in profile over whether to disembark, we sense they would resort to blows. The culmination of these exchanges spill over into the second act of the film and form Glass' ultimate goal, when Fitzgerald's hatred of Indians has combined with his superiority complex to lead him to do what he does. Watching Glass' recovery; escapade and catharsis is truly something to behold. Perhaps the film's most impressive characteristic is its sheer nihilism: this is not a film wherein anybody really wins (except for, maybe, the Indians) Nobody's actions brings back their deceased loved ones; the world remains an incredibly savage, existential place full of death, pain, grief and natural selection - tomorrow, as today, a pack of wild dogs will savagely bring down a buffalo in order to eat him - time continues ticking, inevitably, towards whatever the future holds for us. Everyone (those few who survive) is largely worse off for what they experience in the film. Whatever you take from the film the most, there can be little denying that ""The Revenant's"" is a powerful accomplishment."
" The wool is over everyone's eyes
",0.0,0.991,2018-04-10 00:00:00,6,"There is a thing that happens every year when DiCaprio's movie that is good enough to get into Oscar contention releases.
His fans are eagerly anticipating it to be more in the line of the departed(aka macho movie which celebrates masculinity) and not a j.edgar. Then the movie comes out which more or less gives them what they expect. Which is a well made movie that doesnt challenge the audience nor does it People often forget how accurate studios are with the release date they give a movie. They dont waste prime oscar release slots for oscar misfires..they allocate those slots for movies they think they can get behind and market/campaign to successful results atleast getting nominations.
So you know if a studio like fox or paramount is heavily marketing a movie then at the very least it will get bunch of oscar nominations aka the movie is worthy enough for bunch of nominations.
Then all the people inside hollywood or on the peripherals of hollywood who ever benefited from Dicaprio will root for him. In entertainment industry people are loyal to favors and not to actual talent. Its like living on a ship. You are loyal to whomever helps your stay on the ship and not the best person on the ship.Biggest currency in hollywood is doing favors.
What I often thought that proved to be wrong this year is the size of the people that owe him favor is much larger than imagined. They are in every walk of showbiz campaigners,studio exes,producers,actresses,actors,directors,anchors,music artists who are his buddies at parties etc. Who do you think margot robbie will vote for when dicaprio is one of the nominees ? he practically launched her career ..all these mask what the movie really is.
Which is , its a movie competently made by a director who wanted to take on a challenging subject and then an actor who helped get the checks to make the movie and everything about this movie is honest except the lead actor. Lead actor covers up his incompetence perfectly by trying so hard with over acting, by spending so much money to make the movie as authentically as possible and alas at then end a significant portion of audience who dont know anything about acting think of him as the greatest actor ever."

But the side plots (an abducted indigenous woman, the moral questions of side characters) are beside the point and never go anywhere.And like many films, the middle is about 45 minutes too long.

If anyone here says it would take longer than 5 minutes to give an incredibly in depth review of the story they are blessed with the gift of gab and exaggeration. DiCaprio and The Bear are the only two good things about the movie. If they didn't get Leonardo to act this part I doubt that anyone would have rated the movie more than a 2 out of 10.

The first half hour or so of this is totally rivetting, especially on the big screen.
The skirmish/battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, genuinely terrifying, with the confusion and terror being perfectly rendered on the screen. 
And of course the bear attack, real edge of the seat stuff. 
The do yourself a favour and go home - you've had good value for you money, and if you stay you're about to waste two hours of your life.
What's wrong? It's just silly basically.
The ironically-named Mr Glass (he's indestructable, hence the irony) is so badly injured by the bear he can only move his eyes. Then he can just barely crawl through the woods. Then suddenly he's walking with the aid of a branch. Then he survives a near-freezing river experience without a sign of hypothermia. Then he's jumping on a horse's back. I can't do that and I'm really fit, no bear-mauling damage at all!
Next he has a magic musket. Muskets fire one shot. Then they have to be reloaded. But Mr Glass has acquired the world's first self-loading musket, because it seems able to fire at will, without requiring powder, shot, etc.
He rides of a cliff into the top of a tree then subsequently falls to the ground. No damage, obviously. Mr Indestructable! Then he climbs into the stomach of his dead horse to keep warm, the stomach I presume being around 6 feet or so in length. Gee that was a big horse!
Finally arrives at the fort, almost immediately goes back out to find his arch enemy Tom Grumpy Hardy. With one person accompanying him. Why? Why not 20 men? 
Next he props his shot dead pal on a horse (as a decoy) by putting a branch down the chap's jacket. Why doesn't the dead man simply fall of sideways, or slump off forwards or backwards? No idea. It's magic! 
I really wanted to like this movie, I like Leonardo di Caprio and also Tom Hardy, and the cinematography is good. But this is just daft, silly, an insult to one's intelligence. It's not a fantasy film after all."
" Great direction and effects but nothing original here ...
",0.0276,0.8851,2018-02-12 00:00:00,5,"The original story about Glass as published in The Missouri Trapper ( http://hughglass.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1825-Hugh-Glass-article.pdf ) was far more interesting due to the bleakness of the real events.This movie would have been richer and more focused if it had dispensed with unnecessary embellishments and stayed closer to the true story.Instead we get a standard serving of tropes on a very pretty plate: Bad thing happens, abandoned person survives against odds to exact his revenge. The end. Oh, and the scenery is beautiful.Tom Hardy's bad guy character, Fitzgerald, never had the chance to be raised from a fairly 2-dimensional mumbling racist. The motivations of the Indian chief looking for his daughter was filler and you could cut out all scenes involving this group and the French trappers, and end up with a tighter film.There were some impressive effects used to create some very long takes - nice sophistication but if you are adding icing to the cake, at least make a nice cake.Almost every other DiCaprio film is better than this one. Watch this if you really don't have anything else to do for 2.5 hours."
" Worth ALL The Hype!
",0.2942,0.9386,2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"A note to light-hearted movie goers: The Revenant is not for you.Life pits it's will on Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker & fur trapper played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. Iñárritu damn near tortures his cast & audience in telling the story of Glass' revenge against the people, headed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823, this is one brutal epic piece of film making. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw some of the actors referred to the filming as a living hell and watching the movie, you can feel their pain.The movie doesn't take long to get started and you can barely even get your bearings of what's going on before Glass and his expedition are attacked by Arikara Indians and as mayhem ensues, Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son, Hawk. But that is all tame in comparison for what is about to come. I am, of course, talking about the infamous fight scene where a mother grizzly (protecting her cubs) lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Make no mistake - this scene is as brutal as it comes and while you know that it's all ""film trickery"", it still doesn't stop you from believing it's real when you're actually watching it unfold.The whole movie, though, and not just that scene, is a visceral punch in the gut. You could gripe about the excess carnage and lack of philosophical substance, but surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject here, and he delivers with brilliance. And then there's DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard, his words are mostly reduced to grunts, but he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. It's a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and is well deserving of his Oscar nomination & winThe Revenant is one of those movies that justifies it's hype, award nominations and wins. Definitely a must see film."
" Absolute trash
",0.0,-0.9981,2018-02-03 00:00:00,2,"People do not like this movie because it is good- they like it because other people tell them to like it. It is not a good film. It is one of the worst films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I spent two hours on a pile of trash- I was forced to watch it, really, I never wanted to- but I went ahead anyway, and I'm glad I watched it, because now I can warn you about it. Do not watch this movie.First of all, the movie is boring. But it's also too exciting at the same time. When I saw this film, I thought it had been made by a crazy person, because there was no plot as far as I could tell. All I saw was a neverending cavalcade of images- men running through the snow, getting bloodied up- shadows and lines and whispering, and big burly bearded pioneers. It was like the anti-violence therapy that Alex gets in A Clockwork Orange. I realized that this was a film that cared more about its visuals than its core message- it spent billions on renting and props and setting and cameras- but spent almost nothing on making the characters likable or having any lines. They could have made it a silent movie- nobody ever talks, except for a few seldom occasions. Some screaming, and a grizzled old pioneer tells a crazy story about a dead chipmunk or something- but that's it. The script mast have been three pages long. I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio- I had never seen a film with him in it before this one- so I didn't need to be confused about which grizzled old pioneer he was. But I was so confused. All the bearded mountain men looked identical- I couldn't even tell the protagonist from the villain. I didn't even know there was a villain until the very end, when they meet up with each other. I did not know what was going on. All I saw was snow and men and blood. Everything about it was unclear. It was disgusting- he falls off cliffs, gets eaten by a bear, swims in sub zero water, eats a stomach or something- this is a snuff film, not a historical drama. I do not want to watch a man come near death for two long hours. But even the most action packed scenes did not excite me- strangely, they bored me. I was bored by this movie. It's not a good movie.It was made by the same stupid idiot as Birdman- I should have guessed- and we can see, in the first scene, that it is made by the same idiot as Birdman. The first scene has a bunch of pioneers stumbling around, setting up camp- and it's all taken in ONE SHOT, and the perspective of the camera sways around the actors, zigzagging- and then they get attacked by some indians, and they run around, and the camera follows them, instead of just staying still- all just in ONE SHOT- and then we get some cuts, which are nice, because I hate that ""one shot"" business that the guy always gives us. He did it enough in Birdman- he didn't need to do it here.Also, they added Native Americans in- even though the guy in real life DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIAN RELATIVES- in fact, the guy who made this movie was criticized for how historically inaccurate it was- how dramatized it was, all in the hopes of getting some more cash from gullible suckers- how much unnecessary violence there was in it- and how he just added some Indians in there to be politically correct. How sad. How sad. There do not need to be any Indians. Not racist, it's just that there shouldn't be any Indians if there WEREN'T any Indians. This film is absolute trash from the gutter. Do not watch it. It is a waste of money."
" A Visual Wonder
",0.0,-0.9983,2018-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This was a review I wrote back in early 2016 for a class project, so this was before Leo won his Oscar.The Revenant is the movie many say is finally going to get Leonardo DiCaprio his long deserved Best Actor Oscar. Inspired by true events and directed by Academy Award winner Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), this Action/Drama film has received Oscar nominations for acting, cinematography, editing and many more categories. But does it live up to all of the critical attention it's getting?
 The movie starts out with a panning shot of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) and his son Hawk (Forest Goodluck) in a flashback in which his deceased Indian wife is encouraging him to keep fighting onward. The film then cuts to a continuous shot of Glass and some of his regiment hunting for food for their camp in unsettled territory. While they are gone, a hostile clan of Indians attacks their camp, killing around 30 of Glass's men. The survivors retreat to the river and escape on their boat, only to abandon it in an attempt to mislead the pursuing warriors. Things take a turn for the worse when Glass gets mauled by a bear and is near death. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) echoes the sentiments of many who believe they should leave Glass behind to increase their odds of survival. But when money is offered by one of the regiment commanders to stay with Glass until he is able to move, Fitzgerald volunteers along with Bridges (Will Poulter) and Hawk. Eventually Fitzgerald gets tired of baby sitting and tries to kill Glass, but ends up killing Hawk instead. He lies to Bridges about Indians approaching and they both leave Glass for dead. Abandoned, Glass (with the help of the voice of his dead wife) picks himself up, conquers the elements and gets back to his camp. The remainder of this epic film recounts his perilous tale of survival. 
 Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Inception) delivers one of the best performances of his career, playing Hugh Glass, a man whose wife was killed by soldiers during a raid. In a good eighty percent of the film Glass is mute due to a bear attack in which his vocal cords were damaged. Unable to speak, he communicates an incredible array of emotion through his facial expressions and actions. There's one scene when he is strapped to a plank of wood, still recovering from his wounds and Fitzgerald wants to kill him, but Hawk saves him. Fitzgerald then stabs Hawk and Glass is upset to the point of foaming at the mouth out of anger at Fitzgerald for killing his only son. In another scene Glass is cautiously approaching an Indian from his wife's tribe. When the Indian points his weapon at him, he immediately falls and successfully explains that he is injured and needs help using body language. DiCaprio has come a long way from the pretty boy he played in Titanic, and while this isn't my personal favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie, his ability to convey complex emotions and communicate without dialogue definitely makes this performance Oscar worthy. I hope he finally gets it. 
 Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road) plays the antagonist in this movie, and is an extremely unlikable, selfish jerk throughout the film. He is constantly finding ways to take advantage of others for personal gain. He shows this best in one scene where he and Bridges are traveling back to the camp to get their reward for staying behind. Bridges asks Fitzgerald, at gunpoint, if he lied to him about leaving Glass because of incoming Indians and Fitzgerald says yes. Bridges isn't the bravest or the smartest of men, and is unaware that his gun isn't loaded. Fitzgerald, however, knows the gun is not loaded and wrestles it from Bridges. He points it at Bridges, telling him to stay quiet about the lie. In classic villain fashion, he says ""the Lord giveth and taketh"" and pulls the trigger. Bridges of course is OK, but has received the message loud and clear. At the end of the film Fitzgerald in his final act of cowardliness, tries to kill Glass to cover up his lies and treasonous acts. It was a hard fought battle but in the end, Fitzgerald bites the bullet, or in this case, the arrow. An excellent performance overall by this multi-talented actor who should be a contender for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
 Alejandro González Iñárritu hired Emmanuel Lubeski for the cinematography, and it is some of the best I've ever seen. He makes some interesting choices like multiple continuous, one take shots. The best example is when DiCaprio gets attacked by the bear. The way they shot it in one take is absolutely outstanding. Just when you think they are going to cut away to another angle, they stay with the same shot throughout the entire scene, which makes it even more tense than it already is. Another technique Lubeski used a lot was close ups on the characters' faces. Probably the most intense part of the film, aside from the bear attack, is the final fight between Glass and Fitzgerald, which is mostly done in one take. The way they zoom in on the battle made me super tense from the expressions on their faces as they were dueling to the death. He also shows incredible scenery in many shots. We soak up mountains, sky, horizon, and forests thanks to Lubeski's glorious camera work. I would not be surprised if he won the Oscar for Best Cinematography; this guy know how to make scenes visually memorable. 
 The soundtrack was created by Alva Noto and Ryûichi Sakamoto, two names I have not seen before. They do a good job setting the scene by the use and lack of use of background music. In the beginning of the film when the Indians are invading Glass's camp, the music drowns out the battle sounds, setting up the somber mood of the lives being lost as Glass and his men retreat to their boat on the shore. Probably my favorite instance of where they don't have any music is the scene where the bear mauls Glass. The absence of the music make the scene extremely tense since were are forced to listen to the agonizing screams of Glass and the grunts of the bear without anything to soften or detract from those sounds. The music finally comes back in at the very end of the scene when Glass and the bear fall down the hill and the bear lands on him and both lay motionless. I will definitely keep my ears open next time I go see a film with these two as the film composers.
 Of course, movies are not perfect, and there are a few nitpicks that I have with the film. The first one is in the scene where Glass is still recovering from his bear attack and some hostile Indians find him near a stream. He gets away by swimming. He can hardly walk without collapsing, so how can he swim as fast as he did away from the Indians? The current helped a bit but there were sections of the river that were calm and the Indians were shooting him with arrows. One or two should of hit him. Another issue comes up after Glass rescues an Indian girl from a rapist and flees from the group the rapist is from. He then falls off a cliff into a tall tree while his horse falls all the way down and dies on impact. In the next shot Glass looks fine except for having a bit of difficulty walking. This makes little sense since he was critically injured earlier in the film and is still not one hundred percent back to full health. And finally, immediately after the fall, a snowstorm hits, and Glass cuts out the organs of his dead horse, goes inside for warmth (much like Luke in Star Wars Episode V) and survives the night inside the horse buck naked. I would think that would lead to a faster death by frostbite, but I'm no expert. It just left me confused and a little skeptical. These must have been the embellishments to the ""inspired by actual events"". There were some instances where an off-camera character's voice sounded a bit odd, like 2 of the same person was speaking at the same time, but that only happened a few times. Even the best of films can have a few small flaws. 
 Overall, The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015, which says a lot coming from a year that produced films like Star Wars, Mad Max and Inside Out. The acting is great, the chemistry between the actors is believable, the cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen, and the music makes the scenes memorable. It definitely deserves a least a few awards, one for the cinematography and one for Leonardo DiCaprio for pulling off an excellent performance of a character that had to be very difficult to portray. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of DiCaprio, great camera work and intense survival films."
" A ghost film about a revenant, a double miss
",-0.4404,0.9972,2018-01-31 00:00:00,1,"Let's say it, this film is one of the Oscar-flop of 2016. Beautiful object, by an excellent filmmaker, but for once has planted. The Academy (and others) did not see anything.The immediate impression is very positive. The photography is spectacular, costumes, makeup perfect (it's like) and the physical commitment of all the actors is impressive. The rhythm is slow, the plans are long and fluid. The story ... that's where it gets stuck.
This film is gold wrapping that wraps a bronze medal (it could have been chocolate)I think Father Iñárritu got lost in his technical performance and the intensity of the context of his shooting.
After the very successful Birdman, who already put in play a technical challenge (very long shots) but was touching and fascinating by his scenario, his characters and this subtle game between the theatrical form and cinematograph, here he adds a technical layer but forget about everything else.
Because for the form, it is difficult to do better. Mainly thanks to the shooting locations and the magic of the weather phenomena. Magic that made several team members left the shoot because of the difficult conditions.
Here too we are dealing with long, very smooth shots, but because there is a but, this process is not ideal in all situations. And not all the time. The specificity of cinema is the succession of different points of view. The transition from one plane to another is an alchemy that creates our emotional involvement. A little like the chemistry that makes it possible to obtain a 3rd ingredient from the two completely different 1sts, the assembly makes it possible to create a sensation which is born from this succession of different images. Here this process involves us in what is happening on the screen (being a witness continuously of everything that happens) but curiously I found that it prevented me at the same time from entering the heart Of the history. I floated around the characters and in these snow-covered forests but I was not there.
I think that's where the technical process became its own justification and no longer a way of telling the story. Each day of shooting, the whole team repeated (blocking) these very complicated plans and at the end of the day, they had about 1 h 30 to turn the shots or plans. That's probably what made the filming so hard and long. A system to be able to say that one kept his line, that one preserved an artistic integrity.
Unfortunately, when a method becomes its own raison d'être, it condemns the purpose of the company: tell a story, make us live emotions.There are several moments when wow have it in his head, but the heart is not there. Because the story is very linear and does not carry major issues. For short, it comes down to: argument, left for dead, survival, revenge, end.
During each of these stages, few moral questions are raised. There are some, but they remain confined to the facts presented. We leave the wounded man to his fate: but he is still alive, yes, but the Indians are coming. That kind. For a good part of the movie, DiCaprio struggles like hell. This kind of experience forces the one who lives it to make profound changes, such as during a pilgrimage. Here (almost) nothing. The character advances, survives, fights but nothing lets feel that he really lives the situation. Probably because the process (yet): paste a wide-angle lens on the nose of the actors imposes a way of seeing things that does not necessarily stick with what we tell. The system becomes its own disadvantage and kills what has spawned it.
We are very far from Seul au Monde, with Tom Hanks, where we feel transformed over the course of his adventure. I was infinitely more excited when I saw The Gray with Liam Neeson. Same context, the Indians in less, the soul and more,
The physical commitment of the actor is admirable but that's not what makes you vibrate. There are indeed some effects of style (appearances of his wife and son - adoptive) but which are only dreams, visions. They show us what he lost.Painful detail that must be taken into account before seeing this film: its masochism. The number of sufferings through which the protagonist goes is such that it made me think of Mel Gibson's Passion. 2 hours of whipping. Here it is a little that, more varied. Such a martyr is almost survivalist pornography.All this for what? A story of revenge. History of fat and cruel colonists.
Iñárritu has offered us some sumptuous films like 21 Grams or Babel. But here, the shell is empty, because I do not see what can be removed. Even the best filmmakers can crash. Iñárritu often talks about the ego in his interviews. And in general, it is people who have trouble getting rid of it who talk about it the most. I think he got himself here.This film has the form of a work of art but does not have the substance. Its shape is reminiscent of Terrence Malick's films except that it is sorely lacking in sensitivity. Malick (in The Tree of Life for example) shows a succession of moments of life, without necessarily linking them by a dramatic plot, but everything digs in us and throughout the film, we are brought into this state that makes the films so wonderful sometimes. Here we live viscerally events (which is already not bad) but nothing ""hollow"".
We could make a musical analogy: this film is a bit like the last albums of the Dream Theater group. Formerly the spearhead of progressive hard-rock inventive, sensitive and technically very high level. Today they play their own farce, flowing in an infinite complexity but without soul.In view of the beauty of the film's photography, the intensity of the actors' play (should they overplay for that to be seen behind their hair and their disheveled beard? Or is it to compensate for the emptiness of the characters?) and its slow form, it is easy to believe in a great movie. Iñárritu probably believes it. To believe is not to be.
In any case, I did not find what makes me go sit in a dark room.
I bet in a little while, nobody will talk about this movie anymore. Only time reveals what's true and what's not."
" Amazing in every regard except for story.
",0.5859,0.9945,2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Its a shame that in a movie with such exceptional directing, acting, cinematography, music, and production design that the story couldn't have been amazing as well. That's not to say that the story here is necessarily bad it just feels a little thin especially for a 2 1/2 hour film. There are definitely elements of a compelling story here, especially when it comes to the internal and external conflicts of the two main characters, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald (played marvelously by Leonardo DiCaprio in a career best performance and Tom Hardy) Hardy in particular is the most fleshed out and interesting character and has several monologues that let you get to know him as a person and its pretty riveting.The movie clearly is not trying to be story driven, instead its more focused on imagery and themes and does both very well. In fact basically everything about this movie is spectacular hence the high rating, but if it had a better story this could easily be a 10/10 and one of the greatest films ever made. Still worth a watch at least once, especially if your interested in making films yourself someday because their is plenty of mastery here both behind and in front of the camera. To talk a little more in detail about the acting its superb all around. I'm not always the biggest fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, in fact I think he has given many overrated/underwhelming performances, but he knocks it out of the park here with a subtle and nuanced performance. DiCaprio shows a ton of emotion here despite not having very many lines which is not something I would have thought was in his ability's but I was proven wrong here. Tom Hardy is exceptional as the main antagonist of the film. He does a good job making his character not feel evil necessarily, but like an ordinary man who's trying to survive and painfully unfeeling towards his fellow man due to his past. Its Hardy's best work since Bronson. Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also both totally believable in supporting roles as well."
" Very good film, but not quite great
",-0.5675,-0.6363,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Revenant' (noun: ""a person who has returned, supposedly from the dead"") is a film about a man left for dead, Glass (DiCaprio), and his lust for revenge keeping him alive in the wilderness. Set in the 1820s, in what was then the Wild West of Montana (but filmed mostly in Alberta, Canada), Captain Henry (Gleeson) and his men, including Glass, his son Hawk (Goodluck), Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Bridger (Poulter) are collecting pelts (I assume deer?) when attacked by Native Americans, setting them on a desperate journey back to 'civilisation'.Obviously, plenty goes wrong, including Glass being attacked by a Grizzly Bear, which even though it's CGI, is an amazing/horrifying thing to watch! He survives, but is left for dead and thus begins his improbable survival tale for vengeance. There was a few things I didn't like that much, including the score (too piercing at times), the length (over two & a half hours, and it meanders for about 40min in the middle) and some of the repetitiveness (always seem to be sitting around a fire!) and unnecessary flash-backs/visions.However, the cinematography is absolutely superb - hopefully more films are made in Canada after this! - and Leo is solid, with his shaggy hair and crazed stare on display. Hardy is great and completely unrecognisable as Mad Max, while Poulter provides the film's conscience. For mine, it's a better film than 'Birdman', but although it strives for it, it's still not an exceptional film. The ending leaves you, like Glass, exhausted and questioning everything."

Inarritu just followed Birdman (all the words) with The Revenant (no words needed). Enough said. And as if the directing effort was not sufficient/staggering enough, he got two true stars at their absolute pinnacles. This could have been a simple survival and revenge tale, but the visual flair and acting take it to another level. This is what movie theaters are for."

This might be the perfect film for you. My advice is if you have plenty of time and wants to waste more than 2 hours of your life, feel free to.

" Machismo in the mountains
",0.0,-0.952,2017-11-19 00:00:00,3,"We watched this film on the basis of several rave reviews when it first came out. I fail to see why it rated so well. There is spectacular scenery and dramatic camera work. (Although splatters of artificial blood on the camera lens during one of the many violent scenes seem surprisingly sloppy. Nor did the frequent appearance of lens flair serve any artistic purpose as it sometimes can. This was simply careless cinematography.) The whole movie is relentless machismo, one disturbingly violent scene after another and frequent, gratuitous use of the ""F word"" which was not even in the thesaurus of early nineteenth century profanity. If you're intent on watching this appallingly violent, lengthy, sexist and pointless film, turn the sound down and enjoy the scenery. It is the only positive aspect of a very disappointing movie."
" Visually amazing but more of a horror film than a historical depiction
",-0.6209,-0.9953,2017-11-07 00:00:00,7,"The movie is stunning there's no denying that. All this shooting directly in the wild paid off, it was worth the effort. Also, there are a couple of memorable scenes, like the bear attack, sleeping inside a horse's carcass... DiCaprio and Hardy are great actors, Hardy is like a chameleon... But he needs to stop with the weird accents, it goes too far.What I didn't like about the movie is how bleak it is. You're made to believe at first that it's a period movie, historically accurate. And I know some people will still believe it going out from this... But it's wildly fictional. First, Indian attacks wouldn't decimate a well armed expedition like this. We're made to believe that back in the day EVERYONE was a savage. Indians killed for fun, the French raped and lied, and the Americans took Indians into slavery or something, and were basically constantly at war. All of this is false. First, the French were known to be mostly peaceful traders, never really at war with the Indians, forming alliances against the English. Second, in the real story, no one died. Glass just went back to Fitz, asked him his gun back, and Fitz didn't kill anyone (Glass never had a son). It's all fiction, and all false. You don't go in icy water so often without stopping first to dry off your clothes by a fire. You don't fall from a cliff into a tree without any injury. You don't recover from a broken leg in a few weeks, or from infection with dry grass and smoke. Texas didn't have any ""ranger"" at the time. The Indians weren't wiped and devoid of every property (yet). I know it's just a movie blablabla but I fear that many people will take this as historical accuracy, thinking white men were constantly at war with Indians, raping and murdering them at any chance in return. This was not the case at all..."
" A family fun film for all ages to enjoy...
",0.5106,-0.9862,2017-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I reluctantly watched The Revenant thinking this would be a boring pioneer drama. Upon watching it in a theater, I have concluded that The Revenant is in fact a pioneer thriller and I that absolutely loved it. Shot in the Canadian wilderness but set in 19th century Missouri, fur trapper Hugh Glass tracks the man who killed his son and is out for blood. To makes matters worse, this tragedy occurred after Glass was brutally mauled by a grizzly bear. The pinnacle scene in The Revenant is assuredly the infamous bear attack. Advancements in CGI and Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the grueling pain of being shredded to death made that scene terrifyingly impressive. The use of the non-diegetic thumping of paws on the ground and the grizzly's haunting breath made this scene a squeeze and hide your eyes type of intense scene. You could truly understand the helplessness of Glass by only hearing what he could hear. One other scene to note is the beginning battle between the Native Americans and fur traders. Since it was a continuous shot, it is amazing how director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu used passing characters across the camera to shift the focus of the scene to another. A whole 2 minutes and 35 seconds of continuous footage is a feat to remember, especially when knowing that this is a wild battle scene where characters must shout, run, and ""die"" on cue. This movie exceeded my expectations and I certainly plan on watching more of Inarritu's work in the future."
" Amazing scenery, weak story.
",0.2263,0.9956,2017-10-30 00:00:00,7,"People have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie and so do i. On one hand it is beautifully made and has absolutely amazing scenery and use of sound, but on the other hand it feels very drawn out and boring at times.This is the kind of movie you will never want to watch twice, the plot is easily remember-able and there is not anything interesting or deep about it, just a guy left for dead surviving the seemingly impossible and seeking revenge right after. You can call this movie visual poetry, since it is really outstanding when it comes to calm, extremely beautiful scenes of nature, also i think Leonardo Di Caprio really deserved his Oscar for this, after waiting for so many years he finally clinged his hands on it with this beautiful performance. Leo was absolutely amazing, even though the plot was bad and the film tried to attract more with its amazing scenery and poetic calming vibe than action or interesting conversations.I was amazed about Tom Hardy receiving an Oscar nomination for his role here, he did an absolutely awful job trying to fake a Texan accent, he was almost inaudible and simply annoying, it was extremely hard to understand what he is saying and it made the conversations even less engaging, as if they already were not in this movie.In my opinion people are giving this film too much negative reviews only because it is quite long and might seem boring for some people, i can agree it is not the most exciting or fun movie to watch, but people have to understand not every movie should be the same action packed thriller people enjoy. I can guarantee there are a bunch of people who absolutely loved it for its outstanding shots of the mountains and nature in general. Not to say it is the greatest film ever, but it certainly does not deserve the 1 out of 10 star ratings, that is just simple hate for something you do not like, some aspects of the film are amazing and that is something i can not take away from it, even though it the plot was kind of shallow."
" DiCaprio Holds Together An Over-Rated But Watchable Movie
",0.0,0.9951,2017-10-27 00:00:00,6,"I was surprised to discover that ""The Revenant"" was based on a true story - then disappointed to learn that it was only very loosely based on a true story - a lot of important details in the movie (like Glass's Pawnee wife and son) are simply not true, and the real story of Hugh Glass wasn't really a revenge story. What was true was the bear attack. I was familiar with the silly story about Leonardo DiCaprio (or really Glass, his character) being ""raped"" by the bear. That was utterly ridiculous. The movie made clear that this was a female bear with cubs nearby. Why anyone would start such a story is beyond me. It was a bear attack - a pretty vicious one that was very well portrayed. And, as I said, it's really the primary connection to the real story of Hugh Glass.Set in 1823, the movie starts strongly, with a depiction of an Indian attack on a group of American fur traders. That's very well choreographed. In fact, overall - including the depiction of the bear attack and the choreography of the Indian attack - the strongest part of the movie is probably the work of director Alejandro Inarritu. His work was excellent. All throughout the movie you see great camera work, excellent photography and spectacular scenery. All that is so good - and, in fact, it's almost too much. It seems to take over the movie at times. That's probably because the story as a whole didn't exactly enthrall me. The movie is set up as a revenge story, with Glass hunting down Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) - who had killed his half Pawnee son. As I said, that's fake, and really the movie doesn't emphasize the revenge element. This is really a survival story - and there are times when you wonder how Glass survived. How did he survive the wounds from the bear attack? How did he survive the raging river and waterfall? Why didn't he freeze to death once he got out of the river, soaking wet in the middle of winter with snow on the ground? How did he survive the plunge over the cliff? He's almost superhuman - the survival scenes are too unbelievable to make Glass a character you can really empathize with. There are also more than a few cringe worthy moments. There is that gruesome bear attack. There's Glass cauterizing his own wounds. There's Glass gutting the horse so he can crawl in to stay warm. Yeah. I was wincing a few times. But those are scattered throughout the story, and for long periods there's not much to fall back on but the scenery and photography. It's beautiful, yes, but some of it could probably have been taken out for the sake of making a tighter and more focused movie.Having said that, the story did grow on me as it went along and came closer to the climactic confrontation between Glass and Fitzgerald. I admit my attention wandered a few times, but I was never tempted to just step away from this. DiCaprio offered a basically one man show for extended periods, and was all right doing that. I've probably seen actors pull it off better than he did (Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco in 127 Hours, maybe even Robert Redford in All Is Lost all come to mind) but DiCaprio was pretty good in holding it all together. And I did like the ending. The final scenes in which Glass finally confronts Fitzgerald were very well done. It wasn't true, but it was well done. Interestingly, I also found a pretty consistent spiritual theme running through the movie - which I wasn't actually expecting.I think this is a bit over-rated, but it was worth watching. (6/10)"

He was a cat that used up nine lives A point glossed over was his forgiveness of the boy who had to endure being with the nemesis. That showed a character of wisdom. We got to see how the young frightened lad was lied to and had to follow the bad guy, but there was a scene where the boy gave food to the female Indian hiding in her village after a massacre.The symbol of the bear attack, so vicious, connects with another of his realities of defending his own son.The movie also followed tradition in that Natives live their wisdom and stories and ancestor spirituality, as an important part of their ways.Glass had nine lives, super human for sure. First there was early Indian village massacre where his boy was 9 or so, where he lost his Indian wife. Then massacre of his men in opening scene of movie, then escaped and bear attack. Then desertion by his men, confusion of teams, almost killed by nemesis, witnessed murder of son and betrayal, thrown into pit with dirt, crawled to son. Then hardships to survive winter - escaped Indians going down rapids. Met Shaman in deep winter with 3 open fires and a buffalo carcass. Friendship and Shaman built a shelter for Glass to heal. Glass woke up and discovered Shaman murdered (didn't really think this had to be a plot). Glass stole horse, saved Indian daughter that the tribe is looking for and attacking white tribes for that reason. Glass fell over cliff with horsecut horse, oh my god. Found his way back to the village of his men. Epic battle, he let the enemy down the river 'in God's hands' to the Indians. The Indians respected him with reverence – near the end you see the scene of them walking by Glass, one by one. His mission has ended, he avenged and found peace. He became a legend on both sides – Whites and Indians."

One expects DiCaprio to arrive at the outpost he's crawling to in the shape of a throbbing, gurgling pile of minced meat. This guy could survive a meteor hit - which he in a way resembles, traveling huge distances in a perfect curve, unstoppable by ground objects.This film is not even as beautifully shot as some people make it out to be. Instead of being the saving quality of the film the pictures are uneconomic, unconcentrated, boringly bleak and always almost held at elbow's, even at kneecap's height, which made me feel like a toad.The only truly memorable thing, in my opinion, is the acting of Tom Hardy. I really believed he was the role he played. DiCaprio also does a good job, despite not being given a character by the writers, but an assembly of blood bags with a head on it.6 out of 10."

It was very boring. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters whatsoever. Its not the actors' faults; the acting was brilliant. The writing on the other hand..., 90% of the movie consists of only neat visuals and lines with no substance. None at all. Not a single line made me feel any emotion. Visually, it was stunning. But the landscape even got dull after a while, somehow.Overall, essentially nothing happens for most of this movie. It's gruesome just for the sake of being gruesome with no substance behind the violence. It's overall just unpleasant to watch."

" Leonardo DiCaprio really did deserve all the awards that he got for this role
",0.4588,0.9441,2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,The Revenant is a gorgeous film about a few mens' experiences in northern mid- America in the early 1800s westward expansion era. It was expertly directed. The use of natural light really adds to the danger of the environment that surrounds Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). Innaritu loves the camera to pan around objects and people to create a sense of awe and spectacle.I thought it was his best film by far. The realism and intensity of his performance really comes through. The story was gripping throughout the whole film and I found the twists and turns very interesting. ---Yidioo
" A cinematic adventure or a revenge movie drawn out across the great Northlands?
",0.4588,0.6959,2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"While The Revenant masks it's purpose with the realism of the great wilderness, the movie goer ""take away"" is not as assuming. ""Castaway"" is another survival movie framing the human spirit in itself, not staked to the ground in preconceptions. Quite simply, revenge is a strong motivator, as are the ghosts of our past that take us down our personal wells of failure. The experience of the film is the star, as is Tom Hardy's ""Fitzgerald"" a survivor furrier in soldiers outfit, but separated from honor and morality. His survival leaves him with clear decisions, while honor clouds the others. Leo DiCaprios' Hugh Glass is the understated hero, with a history of no-aggression, but the gumption to survive the unthinkable twice to then go on the mission best served cold, or in the directors case, freezing! It's a true dilemma and understandable on another level that, thankfully, you or I will never have to experience. Much like ""saving Private Ryan"", we start with a gruesome battle of the times before settling in on the great expanse of the powers that be. Where is honor in fighting someone else war on their terms. How does dignity prevail in war? War is a fight without dignity but war movies are in need of a morality that justifies our entertainment. That's one hell of a dilemma for the audience that I've yet to come to grips with, which is why the script calls for Leo to lose the rifle prior to the final battle. That's when the director lost me...."

It is easy to understand why the audience reaction is more divided, but to me the low ratings are too harsh. The visuals, direction and acting are so brilliant that even if the film didn't impress me it still would have gotten no lower than a 4 or 5.Its best assets are the visuals and direction. Simply put, 'The Revenant' is one of the best-looking films of the year and a thing of sheer beauty. The settings are rich in atmosphere and the lighting remarkably natural, but it's the cinematography that shines brightest, it's both intimate and immersive. Iñárritu's direction is even better than in his outstanding direction in 'Birdman', some of the best direction of the year.Acting is marvellous, everybody showing great commitment. Leonardo Di Caprio got his only Oscar for his performance here and it was more than well deserved in one of his best films and performances, a performance of emotional intensity and honesty that is most agonisingly poignant. Tom Hardy excels in bringing brooding menace to his role, and Will Poulter is impressive too.'The Revenant' has much more to it than those things. The action is brutally tense and the story, while deliberately paced and very simple, immerses the viewer in how gripping it is, being intense and emotional. The characters are strongly realised.Film fares least in the script which is not bad at all but occasionally a little garbled. This is such a minor criticism however and not enough to bring down my rating.In conclusion, brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

" A gripping tale of survival and revenge
",-0.5267,-0.977,2017-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Hugh Glass is working as a guide for a group of trappers when they are ambushed by a group of native Arikara who are looking for their chief's kidnapped daughter. The surviving trappers along with Glass and his son escape down river but not long afterwards Glass is horrifically mauled by a bear. He manages to kill it but only just survives. While the main party go ahead to get help Glass is left with his son and two of the trappers. Fitzgerald, the elder trapper thinks they should leave him despite being paid a bonus. When he thinks they are alone he tries to smother Glass but is stopped by his son who he then murders. Glass is then left all alone in the wilderness and isn't expected to last more than a few hours however he does survive and struggles back to health and starts to make his way back to Fort Kiowa. He will have a struggle to find anything to eat and must cross hostile territory to get there; it will test him to the limit of his endurance. Meanwhile Fitzgerald has made it back to Fort Kiowa and has told everybody he did everything he could to save Glass; when Glass finally gets there he will want his revenge.Like so many stories 'based on real events' a little bit of reading suggests quite a few liberties have been taken with the actual facts that doesn't matter too much though as this is still a fine story. The opening ambush is exciting and quickly got me gripped. The story got even more tense afterwards. The bear attack was brilliantly shot in a way that made it look very real and very brutal. Once he is alone in the wilderness the film perfectly captures the bleakness of terrain; you can almost feel the cold as Glass struggles through snow, icy water and even shelters inside the remains of a dead horse. The cast does a fine job; it isn't surprising that Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscar for this he did a great job as Glass and certainly suffered for his art in the freezing conditions. The rest of the cast are impressive too; especially Tom Hardy, who plays the villainous Fitzgerald. At two and a half hours this certainly isn't a short film but at no time did I find myself looking at the clock. Overall I'd certainly recommend it although some of the more violent scenes might bother some viewers."

" Great on style, not quite so great on content
",0.8931,0.9702,2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"I feel a bit like a party pooper, especially as The Revenant was deemed worthy of three Oscars (Best Actor, Best Director and Best Cinematography), but I was underwhelmed by the film and not even just slightly underwhelmed.There's no denying that visually it is a feast, and the well-known scene where Leonardo DiCaprio is attacked and mutilated by a grizzly bear is an cinematic accomplishment all of its own. But: where's the story?As for that bear attack scene, it's hard to believe - although given the CGI expertise filmmakers now have access to, it shouldn't be - that it is entirely and utterly fake: the wood in which it takes place is made up entirely of 'rubber' tree props, the 'bear' is a stuntman in a blue CGI suit and DiCaprio is attached to several harnesses to allow him to seem thrown about by the bear.That is all fine and dandy and makes for a thrilling experience. But it also leads to questions about Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's reported insistence that before filming, his troupe of actors should all go through a week's boot camp so that they get to know and understand the hardship the characters they play suffered and also look the part when it comes to shooting.Now, call me an old cynic but that reported week in boot camp is entirely the kind of story the studio press department would like to get out there to drum up a bit of interest - for which read potential profits - before the premiere. 'Look,' the studio PR tells us, 'this is the real deal, this is actors really suffering for their art, this is serious filmmaking!' For all of which the subtext is 'this film is one you really won't want to miss because it is special.' Yes, but is it really?Although Inarritu nabbed the Best Director Oscar, his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki deserves a lot of the credit and it grabbed him of the little fellers for his camerawork. And apparently Lubezki wanted to work with only natural lighting and eschew artificial lighting so much that filming lasted at most four hours a day.Well, for this old cynic it really doesn't quite stack up, and that snippet of news - as well as other stories 'leaking out' that filming was 'so tough' hardened crew simply walked out of the production in protest - most certainly didn't do pre-publicity for the film (and whisper it quietly, the film's Oscar chances) any harm at all.So what of the film? Well, what of it? What is it about?Superficially, it is at tale of survival against all odds. Our mutilated hero, DiCaprio, is left for dead by two men charged with taking care of him - though the younger man is far less culpable than the nasty old Texan played by Britain's Tom Hardy - yet despite his wounds, despite being at death's door for quite some time, despite plunging into icy-cold water several times, despite his skin 'dying' (which I suppose is gangrene), despite being chased be Native Americans, despite riding over a cliff and plunging several hundred feet - despite it, all dear reader - let me catch my breath! - our intrepid hero manages to find his way back to civilisation after almost two months - it is never clear just how long it took. Well! If that isn't worth an Oscar - Best Survivor Against Overwhelming Odds? - I don't know what is.Once back in civilisation, he is not a bit puffed and sets about chasing down nasty old Tom Hardy, and has enough energy to pretty much kill him. (He doesn't actually do the deed - he remembers the wise old words of a Native American who befriends him on the way and leaves the dirty deed that to an troop of Native Americans who also want him dead). And then he dies. Fancy! What a man!Well, I was pretty underwhelmed. I was underwhelmed by the lack of a story, I was underwhelmed by the vague mysticism which permeated it all but which really made little sense, I was baffled by the intermittent appearance of a gang of French trappers, I was underwhelmed by the gang of Native Americans whose chief is looking for his daughter, and I was underwhelmed by the film's insistence that a man who was barely alive and who could, at first, only crawl everywhere, who ate hardly anything but roots and shoots should still find the energy and resolve to survive hyperthermia finally to get up and walk (and after his supposed exertions) appear to have lost very little weight.Am I being unfair? Well, only if the whole film had not been pitched as 'this is something entirely different - this is real!' Once that line was put out and we were expected to swallow it, the only conclusion is that the film cheats.At the end of the day it is in many ways an entirely impressive piece of filmmaking, but in many other ways it cuts to many corners to be taken completely seriously. For style it gets pretty much top marks, but sadly loses almost all of them quite badly on content."

And the action in this movie is even better than most summer action movies these days, which is odd considering this isn't much of an ""action"" movie.

" Return
",0.0,0.8171,2017-05-06 00:00:00,6,"Left for dead by his companions after being mauled by a bear, an 1820s fur trapper traverses tough terrain to avenge the murder of his son in this epic scale drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Lasting several minutes, the bear attack is very graphic and between the brooding score (co-written by the masterful Ryuichi Sakamoto) and Emmanuel Lubezki's mobile cinematography, 'The Revenant' is often appropriately moody and atmospheric. There is, however, little escaping how relatively simple the plot it is, and as DiCaprio predictably comes across mounting obstacles while trying to locate Hardy, the movie soon turns repetitive. The fact that it takes him the better part of two hours to locate Hardy lessens the tension; his quest is dragged out for so long that his bloodlust fades into the background. More scenes establishing the bond between DiCaprio and his son may have helped, but the film might have also simply been more potent at half the length (twice the intensity). Certainly the contrast between the lush yet hostile landscapes and the hatred at hand renders the film interesting and with thoughtfully accentuated audio effects and the aforementioned virtues, this is a hard film not to recommend. It does take an incredible amount of patience to get through, however, and awesome as the ending may well be, the journey to get there often feels overly protracted."

" The Revenant Review
",0.0,0.9949,2017-04-23 00:00:00,7,"I'm probably going to get some flak for the rating I am giving The Revenant, but I didn't think it was as good as everyone said it was. Stick around and see why.Synopsis: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy Director: Alejandro G. InarrituOkay, if anyone knows the real story of this movie is based off of, then you know that Hugh Glass did not exact his revenge on the men who left him for dead. First thing, it wasn't the dead of winter when he was mauled, it was actually in the middle of the summer. His son wasn't killed by anyone, his son actually lived a full life. These are just two of the many things that have been changed. As I do understand why the film makers took the liberties with the story, I don't think they needed to take it that far. And truthfully, that is the main reason I gave the movie a 7.The reason I gave it a 7 is because of how slow paced the movie was. Although it added to the tone of the movie, it just played out too long. The movie was only two and a half hours long, but until the last thirty minutes it felt like four hours. Adding that I constantly had to keep lowering and raising my volume didn't help.There are a lot of good things though. Even though I didn't like the changes they did make to the story, I still love this story. I wish they would have kept it the real ending where Glass forgave the two men who left him. But, the story is still a tale of survival. The man had to go through a lot to walk up to the men and say what he had to say.Alejandro is a great director. I absolutely love his movies, especially Babel and Biutiful. This is probably one of his not so good movies, but still better than most of his movies. Can't wait to see what he has next.Do I think Leo deserved the Oscar for this movie? No I don't. Tom on the other hand should have won. He stole the show, once again. I honestly think the Academy gave Leo the award for all the years they passed him up. He did a decent job in this movie, but he didn't do anything to extreme like he has done in movies like Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator, Gangs of New York, or The Departed. Geez, I never realized he deserved the Oscar for movies he did with ScorseseFinal Thoughts: Even though I don't like the idea of them changing the story quite a bit I do believe this movie is a watchable movie, hands down.

" Good visuals on an unnecessary movie
",0.4404,0.1397,2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"The movie I'm reviewing is called The Revenant. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and he won an Oscar for this movie. The movie is basically about a pioneer making his way back from a gruesome accident with a bear and tracking down the man who left him (Tom Hardy) for revenge. I thought the movie was pretty average and I didn't get the massive praise it got from both people and critics. I thought that the shots were very pretty and the cinematography was great. But the story was something that should not have been put to screen. The majority of the film was watching Leonardo DiCaprio crawl through the mud and run away from people. The movie stressed the reality of the scenario,by having DiCaprio recover immediately and take a while to heal, showing the harshness of the time and setting. But then they contradict themselves by having him ride off a cliff and survive pretty much unscathed. I love dialogue in my movies, and this movie did a poor job of delivering meaningful dialogue to the audience. From the beginning you knew who everyone was and nothing surprised you. The dialogue was all either misunderstood by me because of the garbled accents, or the fact that it was essentially meaningless. When there was dialogue of course, as I said before most of the movie is the title character crawling in the mud and surviving brutal conditions.Overall I thought the movie was good because of the directing and cinematography, but I never really found myself caring about the story or being more invested than I am in any other revenge plot."

" ""The Revenant"" leaves audiences stunned, unsettled by grizzly, authentic portrayal
",-0.4019,0.2846,2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Icy water trickles gently over the rocks. All is quiet. As the camera tilts up and pans to the right, the barrel of a gun creeps out from behind a tree. Two armed hunters are now visible, moving with caution over the steady flow of the stream.A nearby gunshot shatters the calm. The men stop. Another shot.Screams of terror and fury fill the air as the two men return to their hunting party. Arikara Indians gallop around the camp of fur trappers. Their arrows whiz past the two men, piercing the skulls of others around them.A small group of survivors flees the Arikara. Reaching a boat offshore, the remaining trappers drift down the Missouri River, battered and defeated, carrying only a fraction of the beaver furs they'd trapped over the past few months.This opening scene from ""The Revenant"" captures the brutality exhibited in the true story of its protagonist Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a legendary frontiersman and fur trapper in the 1820s.Following the slaughtering of trappers at the beginning of the film, Glass guides the surviving group back to its outpost, Fort Kiowa. As Glass is scouting ahead he is attacked by a grizzly bear and mauled to the edge of death.Finding Glass underneath the dead beast, captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) leaves him in the care of his half-native son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as it seems that Glass will succumb to his wounds.After a failed attempt to smother Glass, Fitzgerald kills Hawk, buries Glass alive and deceives Bridger about his actions as they press on toward Fort Kiowa. Determined to find Fitzgerald, Glass uses his wit and skill to survive and sets out on a 200-mile path of vengeance across the Northern Plains of America, and you are with him every step of the way.You squirm in your seat as Glass cauterizes his own wounds. You taste the blood and scales of the raw fish as Glass rips it open with his teeth. You lose your appetite for that next handful of popcorn as Glass guts a horse and uses its carcass as a sleeping bag. The authenticity of ""The Revenant"" is not only the product of DiCaprio's dedication, but also of the entire cast and crew. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu was unwavering about filming in strictly natural light, which gave the cast and crew a mere 90 minutes of shooting time each day.Inarritu and his team journeyed for hours in minus 25 degree weather to locations in the Canadian and Argentinian mountains. The production ran five months over schedule and $35 million over budget, but the hell that the cast and crew endured was not in vain.The cinematography is masterful. The close ups are so close at times that DiCaprio's breath fogs up the lens, further intensifying the emotional impact of his performance. The landscape choices and use of all natural light result in breathtaking shots such as one scene when Fitzgerald and Bridger are keeping warm by the fire. As darkness falls, sparks dance upward off of the flames; the camera angle shows them gently float toward the heavens and vanish into the twinkling of the night sky.""The Revenant"" is nominated for 12 Academy Awards, the most at this year's ceremony. Its direction is nearly flawless, its performances, unsettling. But above all, Inarritu paints a captivating portrait of human suffering and the incredible resiliency of a man with a heart of vengeance."

" Technically accomplished, but left me a bit cold.
",0.2382,0.976,2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"This is really more of a 6.5 out of 10, but maybe I'm just splitting hairs. The cinematography is amazing to the point of being distracting. It's as if Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, upon realizing that we have the means to shoot a scene of Leonardo Dicaprio being mauled by a bear in extended, agonizing close-up, decided that every scene should be shot in that way. Maybe I'm overthinking things, but that ended up taking me out of the action. The bear is obviously CG, and since we know that director Innaritu and cinematographer Emmaneul Lubezki are using some digital trickery to make the whole thing appear to be one seamless shot, what's the point? I almost think that scene would have been more effective had it consisted of separate shots, so that a real bear could be employed in long shots, with cuts to a close-up of an animatronic paw crushing Leo or something like that.I should probably talk about the plot now. The story concerns a couple of fur trappers on the Western frontier in the 19th century, who are set upon by violent Natives and have to turn back. When one of them (Leonardo Dicaprio, resorting to masochistic extremes in order to win that Oscar) has a heated debate with a grizzly over which of them deserves to continue breathing, the group leaves him for dead. Tom Hardy plays another member of the trapper group, and he, rather than the bear, is the true villain of the piece. I won't give away what he does, suffice to say that if it weren't for his performance, my rating would be at least two stars lower.This isn't a bad movie. I know I'm being snarky, but it really isn't. That said, I liked Innaritu more when his head wasn't quite so far up his own ass. ""Babel"" might overreach somewhat, but it has a lot more to say than this bloated film. The scenes with Leo forced to fend for himself in the wilderness verge on misery porn. There is something inherently thrilling about watching people survive on limited resources (see ""Castaway"" for a superior example of this).This is the kind of film where I can admire certain parts more than I can say I like the whole. Those tracking shots are impressing, sure. There are some fantasy/dream sequences that are well-shot, but that I can't make head or tail of. The sheer physical torment that Dicaprio must have put himself through for this role is admirable, but then again, he was so much more fun in ""The Departed"". I just wish the film weren't so dead-set on being great that it sometimes forgets to be good."

There was nothing believable about this awful thing from start to finish. Oh, I suppose I could add that, once we were resigned to the disappointment we had a lot of laughs before the much anticipated closing credits. DiCaprio... well, whatever. But what in the world was a fine actor like Tom Hardy thinking? At least he was paid. My advice to you is, don't throw your time down this hole. I wish I hadn't."

Dispute his condition Hugh tries to survive and eventually revenge his mistreatment. And here is where the actors, cinematographers and the directing and writing of Alejandro González Iñárritu go in and make this film a piece of art , with minimal dialogue, beautiful scenes and close to excellent pace.And of course I have to mentioned Dicaprio of here give it all and then some for with almost zero dialogue manage to carry ,about half of the film alone and I am sure that he and the rest of the team after the end of the shooting the were in desperate need of a warm bath and even I felt cold just by watching the flick. You know that it a good sign when the audience feels what they see in the scene and here it is no exception.All in all the film rocks, Leo won his Oscar fair and square and definitely watch it if you haven't already ,it is among the great Oscar films and not a Oscar grab, like Crash(2004) , Sheakespaer in Love(1998)."

" What for?
",0.0,0.9967,2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Yet another (3-) Academy Award-winning effort not really seeming to deserve all the praise, and certainly not worth all the fuss.There are repeated examples of arrogance and disdain for the audience on display here from the inexplicably-Oscar-winning Director Alejandro Inarritu, as well as co-writer Mark L. Smith, and that begins with the decision to adopt straight the title Michael Punke chose for his 2002 novel. No, a ""revenant"" is not somebody seeking revenge, but is a kind of an unkillable zombie figure, returned but no longer really alive, which presumably fits rather well with the behaviour of our (real-life-historical-figure) hero Hugh Class (1783-1833), as played by an Oscar-winning Leonardo DiCaprio.If there is a message to this film it is that life in the 1820s wilderness of North America was incredibly rough and tough...There, I've said it, and it took me one sentence. In the film, the makers devote the best part of two and a half hours to hammering this well-known message home to us, in the process allowing Leo to rasp, groan, moan, gasp, whine and creak at least a thousand times. Other cast members have it far from easy also, but most matter little here compared with the star.Intriguingly, though, when Glass first enters a river in spate formed by melting snow and ice he for once does not gasp at all...I write ""wilderness of North America"", because it is several hours before we finally hear that our story takes place somewhere near the Yellowstone River, and that narrows things down to North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. It finishes at Fort Kiowa which is in turn in South Dakota.I only know it is the 1820s because I read it online, while the makers do not bother to tell us this, nor do they bother with much scene-setting, for example to explain why somebody not obviously in uniform is referred to as ""Captain"" and appears to be in a position to give military-style orders. There are French-speakers and Brits out there, but we're not sure how or why. All are fur-trappers, and in fact Wikipedia tells us readily enough that Glass was part of General Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company expedition of 1823, which was indeed attacked by Arikara/Ree people native to North Dakota by that time close to extinction. The sad truth is that this genuine story seems far more interesting than the film, which does indeed push Glass's real-life survival so far that it regularly looks implausible, even though it did actually happen.Art refusing to imitate life, as it were...The makers' determination to press home the ""incredibly tough"" conditions referred to above is so strong that they refuse to let the sun shine for about 95% of the film, with all being white or dull grey, or in the twilight/dark or in blizzards. This is not possible in real life (and all the more so when snow at times seems to be melting), but since there are various dark and deceitful deeds afoot from the human cast (to say nothing of dangerous animals), we must watch a dowdy film that is heavy on the eye, despite being set in places that - for all their dangers and discomforts - are rightly known for their incredible beauty. Emmanuel Lubezki got a cinematography Oscar for his work here, and there ARE some fine shots of rivers flowing as and where they want to, but I can get those on a nature film (in which, as a bonus, the sun is allowed to shine from time to time).On the (futher) minus side, ""The Revenant"" features a number of moments of - rather incomprehensible and not properly pursued - Native American spiritual elements. Then there are bison herds on the move with wolves waiting to pick off the weak and various more-or-less intriguing mountain-men ""survival tips""; but a great many of these (indeed far more) could be enjoyed (in the truest sense of that word) in, for example, ""Dances with Wolves"" a film with very serious themes (from 1863) and plenty of awfully negative behaviour on display, but one which did not fear depicting beauty ... and sunshine, and did have its story to tell. The same could really be said of ""True Grit"" - one heck of a story probably set in the 1840s, and even ""The Searchers"" (again hugely strong on plot and acting) - which depicted events from 1868.Perhaps (Presumably?) those behind ""The Revenant"" would regard the above films as examples of hopelessly old-fashioned and clichéd beginning-middle-end storytelling, unlike their own piece, which pretty much jumps into existence out of the void with its large-scale Indian attack, and then proceeds with a ""survival and revenge"" plot against a background that has scarcely been set up at all, and with characters that we must perforce ""catch up with"" having never been introduced...While I would certainly not dismiss my time spent with ""The Revenant"" as wasted, and cannot therefore suggest to anyone that they not give it a try, I do go away from it with a sense of being far, far less enlightened or elevated (let alone entertained) than I ought to have been, especially in the case of a film that the Academy clearly adored!"
" A thrilling ride through the woods!!

Leo has always been a strong actor throughout his career and this performance was no different. His performance will make you feel as if you are present in front of him i.e.you are actually in the movie and this is a creditable thing from an actor's perspective. All the co-stars have performed beautifully and never even once you will feel that you are watching a movie. You will feel like you are actually watching real life scenes. This movie is made in the most realistic manner and hats off to the screen play. The only thing that I would want to add is that this movie is not suitable for weak minded people and you got to have a strong heart to watch this movie as certain scenes will create disturbing emotions in you. All in all, the film is an experience which takes you on a realistic yet thrilling ride through the woods and will make you hold your breath on many occasions. So, for the people who can watch violence and have a strong heart, you can always watch this movie as the performances of all the actors, the camera work and screenplay are majestic and impressive."
" Very intriguing
",0.0,0.9992,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Revenant, someone who has come back basically from the dead. This applies to many people in life that make a dramatic return when not being on the ""scene"" for a long period of time, as well as an emergence. A revenant is present in the movie business as well. Many actors dream of winning the coveted Academy Award. Despite being nominated for the award four times previously, Leonardo DiCaprio could never win one despite his most famous works. Some of those on the list include Titanic, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Django Unchained, Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby, Inception, and even Romeo + Juliet. Nevertheless, he was able to achieve what many actors dream of, which is to capture an Academy Award. This would be his first, and for a movie made in 2015, which portrayed him in a whole different role than what he usually plays. This movie that is so hyped up is called ""The Revenant."" This is the tale of courage against the odds of nature, and the determination and grit that one gets from within. One thing to note, as well, is that this movie was based on a true story of an American frontiersman. There were many good movies worth noting in 2015, but none could compared to this one. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, ""The Revenant"" is a must watch even though it was made it 2015 due to the awesome plot, the unbelievable acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the great cinematography showing the beautiful landscape of Argentina and Canada.The tale that Alejandro González Iñárritu got the attention of many audiences with the story of Hugh Glass. Surprisingly this is based on a true story that happened many, many years ago. The story may seem a bit cheesy with the fact that the protagonist overcomes many obstacles within nature. It is also a story of revenge, and Iñárritu reshapes the famed Hugh Glass to a character that everyone can get behind and support, sort of like Rudy. This movie also shows survival, which is captured as Glass does and many others did some actions that shows what one must do to survive in the wilderness. Iñárritu draws people to this story, and it hits people on an emotional level, which separates this movie from the competition.An actor as eloquent in his craft as Leonardo DiCaprio should be rewarded for nailing a role that was unlike others. The usual characters that DiCaprio portrays is the handsome stud, most of the time having a decent amount of money, that all the girls fall in love with and the guys are jealous of. This is true for his films like Romeo + Juliet, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Titanic, and Inception. In The Revenant, DiCaprio plays a scruffy, unattractive, wild frontiersman that at first glance looks nothing like the DiCaprio we all know. Playing this character also meant that doing some gross, gnarly stuff that a person would never imagine DiCaprio doing. Only a really strong actor can play roles that break their usual role norms, and this is what DiCaprio does to make The Revenant one of the best movies.Earth is such a beautiful place with many wonders all over, and Iñárritu captures them in South America and Canada. It is very noteworthy that the conditions in which the shots were filmed was inhospitable especially the parts in Canada. The movie was about a frontiersman and his survival in the wilderness, and the rough conditions were caught nicely. However, the beauty of the landscape was shown despite all the snow and mist. The last scenes that were shot in Argentina had to be the best I've seen in a while. Even though this was towards the end and not the main location like how Canada was, the landscape and the terrain that they filmed at were jaw droppingly good. Alejandro González Iñárritu captured both the beauty and the dark side of Mother Nature elegantly in this masterpiece that leaves audiences in awe.If you have never watched this movie, you must. It has aspects that almost everyone can enjoy whether you are intrigued by cinematography, an award-winning actor, or a compelling story."
" Not Terrible, But Potentially Very Overrated Depending On Taste
",0.1967,0.994,2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"When I first saw the promotional materials for ""The Revenant"", I wasn't all that excited. Wilderness/survival films aren't usually my cup of tea, and while I can appreciate the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio, his presence in a film doesn't usually vault it to the top of my ""must-see"" lists. But then, slowly but surely, ""Revenant"" became the film that any self-respecting film fan ""must see"" in order to accurately judge this cycle's Academy Awards. It even strongly positioned DiCaprio to win his first Oscar. So, I climbed aboard the hype train and finally went to see it. While it isn't a bad movie by any means, I left the theater thinking it has the potential to be very disappointing to people who don't really know what it is about or what it tries to accomplish.For a basic plot summary, ""The Revenant"" is the story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), a fur trader in 1820s America. The basics of his character are that he's a bit of an outcast, having married an Indian woman (now dead) and having a son with her. He also happens to be the best scout of his trading group, so he's still accepted by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). However, when Glass sustains horrific injuries after being mauled by a bear, he is left behind with fellow trader John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Fitzgerald isn't nearly as sympathetic to Glass as the others, however, and basically leaves him for dead. But not so fast...as Glass proves again and again his determination to survive even in the face of insurmountable odds.I think the major misconception I had about this movie was that it would be a dramatic epic...but it isn't. It looks like an epic and has been touted as an epic, but at its core that isn't what ""The Revenant"" is all about. It's actually more of an artistic picture, filled with long, lingering, and beautiful cinematography, some strange/bizarre dream sequences, and just that overall sense that the ""look"" of the film itself was more important than the story/characters.Now, don't get me wrong...the cinematography in ""Revenant"" is some of the best I've ever seen on the big screen. That's why I can still give the move a three-star rating, as it is a visual treat in the way it portrays its wilderness setting. Seemingly around every corner is a new adventure or obstacle that must be faced, and all of those scenarios are filmed in a unique, rollicking style.However, I was just expecting a bit more of a fleshed-out story and maybe some better- developed characters (this seems to start off as a character study of Glass but then morphs into a simple revenge tale). In terms of acting, I also don't quite understand why this is ""the movie"" to (maybe) finally get DiCaprio his little gold statue. His performance is good, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it. Personally, I thought the best character/acting of the whole piece was Tom Hardy's brooding, violent Fitzgerald, as I felt that he was creating emotional drama instead of just reacting to the next obstacle along the way (my evaluation of Leo's performance).So, overall, ""The Revenant"" didn't live up to it's hype for me. I was decently entertained, but that was about it. Now, someone who has a keener eye/appreciation for pure cinematography than I might find it utterly riveting, but that just wasn't to be for me. I'm all about characters and story, and in those areas I didn't see any area in which ""The Revenant"" stood out against even average movies, much less those being heavily promoted as Oscar favorites."
" Pointless butchering skilfully produced

Big names, lot of action, excellent overall atmosphere. There are some sensational scenes, for example the battle at the beginning of the movie, and the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly. There is a lot of struggle, more than a decent amount of action and universal story about the revenge. Probably enough for many.However, when you strip down the story, it would probably fit in less than 2 minutes to explain. Nothing much, really, adding that you would know the end at the beginning, if you are older than 4, of coarse. So what is else there? From the very beginning, and all the way to the really, really long way to the end, there is nothing much more than enormous quantity of rage, blood, cruelty, butchering, violence and some more violence. Even if we can say that this period (beginning of 19th century) was violent, someone might get a feeling that is watching the adventure outside this planet.Finally, we have highly praised and skilfully produced three hours long pointless butchering. Excuse me, but for me this is not a cinematography. For this almost forgotten art, there should be even just a bit more."

This particular film is a one of a kind, and if you can get past its inherit gruesomeness then you shouldn't have any issues enjoying it.The story line is in my opinion it's strongest feature, I deliberately didn't read the plot before watching it as I wanted to see how it unfolds independently. I had a rough idea of the setting but that was about it. I love this historical period and will always give such films a chance. From the very beginning the story is persistently gripping, you never truly know what we'll face next which leads to constant anticipation. Not to mention the actors involved all do a fantastic job. DiCaprio is undoubtedly a talented and well decorated actor and he continues to display that here. Is this is finest role? Well, that'd debatable but irrelevant considering the film's quality. It is true that Tom Hardy is hard to understand in it, yet for me that just shows he's doing a good job, so many actors down the years have failed miserably in their horrific attempts at different accents, Hardy doesn't in this instance.If none of that grabs you then the visuals should. It's set in such a beautiful part of the world, overall adding to the already gripping plot. A good old bear scene can't be beaten either! I understand that some people find excessive gore difficult to watch, and if that's you then probably best to avoid this film. For me, I find excessive gore needless and irritating but it doesn't bother me in this context, after all there's plenty more happening with the story as a whole for that to taint my overall opinion. Also, so many people complain about subtitles in English speaking films... I don't recognise that as a valid criticism unless it's completely needless and counter to the logic of the setting. This film uses a lot of subtitled dialogue but for me that just adds to the contemporary setting. Give it a watch, but be prepared.P.S. I like bears."
" The Revenant
",0.0,0.9638,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Film ""The Revenant"" by Alejandro González Iñárritu is highly acclaimed for its realism combined with almost fantastical landscapes. The film is incredibly beautiful and was shot using natural light and with minimal special effects.There is a conflict in the film between the beauty of nature and the ugliness of human relationships. Cruelty and intrigues set against the background of majestic mountains and forests. The talent of the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki without a doubt deserved the most prestigious film awards.The director was obviously influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky and Terrence Malick, who also took a lot from the great Russian director. Some scenes from the latest movie with Leonardo DiCaprio have copied from the works of the Soviet director. The similarity is evident: people are composed similarly and matching cinematographic techniques are used. The scenes for example where the protagonist is dreaming about ruins of a castle or sees his levitating wife are taken directly from the films of the Russian director.The acting of Leonardo Di Caprio is one of the strongest sides of the film and combined together with the unique cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki made the film ""The Revenant"" a masterpiece of modern cinematography.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2016/02/the-revenant-review/"
" 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century.
",0.0772,0.8022,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Though the acting is undoubtedly some of the best I've seen from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy (two of the finest actors alive today) the true stars of the film are its visionary cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) and director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), who between 'Birdman' (my favorite film of 2014) and 'The Revenant' have just rewritten the book on their perspective talents. I kept thinking to myself, ""this looks like a Terrance Malick film"", which has everything to do with Lubezki's work with Malick on the acclaimed 'The Tree of Life' and the grossly overlooked 'The New World', which remains my favorite historical love story to date. A warning to those squeamish towards violence, 'The Revenant' is brutal; placing the audience in the heart of the battle to the point where you can smell the death and decay. By contrast, I've never seen more breathtaking panoramic shots of nature on the silver screen. 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century."
" Visually an Experience
",0.0,0.9499,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"The Revenant is based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass where we see Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American soldier in the early 19th century. Glass has son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Quickly within several key moments of the film, wee see that Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. Later another member of the hunter's team Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him.The Renevant besides it's well visuals and great acting from the leads DiCaprio and Hardy, the films comes off rather boring and not as exciting or entertaining as a whole, as it is being praise for. Yes, the acting makes the film passable and the cinematography is well done, with great shots of the outside. Though in it's story arc, the film does not capitalize as it should. There were not many twists or turns which keeps the audience prepared and waiting for, unfortunately. Mainly due to the film's long running time (two hours 36 minutes), at certain points it becomes dull and almost predictable. The ending is quite well done, as expected."
" Leonardo DiCaprio at his best
",0.6369,0.8938,2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I can see why The Revenant got nominated for the Oscars. It's beautifully shot with top class actors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy both stand out in this adventure movie. It's for sure one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best acting performances. Even though for a movie that long there is not excessive much talking you never get bored. Au contrary there are a lot of silent passages that add to the feeling of loneliness in those winter scenery's. There's a lot of grunting from the diverse almost deadly wounds. It all works perfectly well to tell this story of revenge and vengeance. There are some graphic scenes that could make your stomach turn, but that also makes this movie stand out from the rest. You can almost feel the frostbite just by watching it. Tom Hardy plays a stone-cold heartless son of a bitch and those roles fits him the best. A long movie that never seemed long when you're watching it."
" Saying this movie is Overrated is an understatement
",0.0,0.9759,2017-02-13 00:00:00,4,"The academy has been known to give its awards to undeserving films over the years. Classic and acclaimed films such as Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas have been passed over for other films. The Revenant certainly takes the cake. Leonardo is a great actor but for some reason the Academy decided to give him a best actor Oscar in this film over his performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. This film has very little substance to it besides the fact that it is about revenge but to see how this revenge unfolds we have watch a long and dull film. A number of viewers raved about the nature and cinematography which was good but award an Oscar for cinematography and be done with it. Instead this ended up being the impetus for garnering praise for a very mediocre film. It absolutely bewilders and even saddens me that watching footage of nature for a quite a while I might add makes a good film. It doesn't matter that the plot was weak and one dimensional, it was hard to understand what was said, it was too long, boring and fruitless as long as the film is 'scenic'. Using that logic a porno film could be made in nature with beautiful scenery and be deemed a great film, it might even win a few Oscars. Perhaps those who are blinded by this 'nature' and scenery should watch the Discovery Channel and National Geographic more often or take a trip or two to some scenic areas in New Zealand or Switzerland. Maybe then you could watch movies and accurately judge its worth. This was a very mediocre film but at least Leonardo finally got an Oscar."
" The Revenant is surprisingly often not realistic
",0.296,-0.9944,2017-01-31 00:00:00,5,"This film often got rave reviews in 2015 and in 2016 on IMDb. But those accolades are not deserved IMO. While many claimed the action was so realistic, huge plot flaws undermine the supposed gritty realism. And the shaky cam usage is irritating and overused by the director. Granted the bear attack was well done and the cinematography often beautiful, but the narrative has a number of weaknesses that bothered me. For example, although the hunting party went to the trouble of constructing a gurney made of logs, nobody fashioned a SPLINT for Leonardo's character's broken right lower leg! Later in the film the protagonist is seen running full tilt and even jumping on to a horse--- a total impossibility. In another scene, DiCaprio's character comes to the edge of a huge cliff spying a river and the next cut has him at the bottom of said cliff in that river. Another ridiculous unrealistic scene. Furthermore, the character, Glass, is submerged in the frigid water of a waterfall and has no problems with the frostbite and hypothermia that would have most certainly ensued! There is also a scene stolen from ""Star Wars"" where Glass eviscerates his dead horse and climbs naked inside of the carcass to seek shelter from a blizzard. And the next day he puts his clothes back on although said clothes were left outside in the blizzard--- of course the clothes are perfect?! Another major problem is the constantly changing scenery. Sometimes there are massive mountains and other scenes have a temperate forest. There are no points of reference to make the settings coherent. Everything is for style and visual effect with no logic. And Leo does a lot of grunting but one never gets a sense of empathy for him except a little bit when Glass sees his murdered son's body. All in all, another overrated exercise in style with an illogical script and disjointed narrative by a self important director"
" I can respect it,but not enjoy it.
",0.121,-0.985,2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"After all the hype I expected to be overwhelmed by ""The Revenant"" but sadly I wasn't. Yes the scenery was awesome,nature was red and raw in tooth and claw,it was obviously jolly cold and Mr di Caprio struggled manfully wrapped up in a bearskin and spent the night inside a horse and generally suffered for his art but somehow he didn't inspire much sympathy from me. I suspect the film has a more appreciative audience in the United States and Canada where the term ""frontier"" still has some meaning. Regrettably it made me think of the New Christie Minstrels' song ""Four wheels on my wagon"" in a lot of places. Somehow all that snow and freezing water,all that suffering and brutality and ""nature is pure - only man is evil"" stuff whilst not exactly passing me by did leave me unaffected. Yes it was crisply shot,well - lit and the sound was excellent,but the unrelenting evil on display eventually got to me and made me more or less indifferent to Mr Glass's fate. Perhaps I am too sensitive. Whatever,""The Revenant"" is obviously worthy of the viewers' respect but it did not induce in me the slightest desire to watch it again."
" Leo commands an empty landscape, Overrated survival film
",-0.2023,0.7795,2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"The Revenant is a strong movie for the first half hour or so and then it reduces to a series of 'greatest hits' moments from survivalist films that we have seen before. This movie is about sixty minutes of material padded to two hours plus, and is too emotionally distant to be worth the endurance that it asks of the viewer.With that in mind, the film has strong points. This is NOT remotely an award winning performance from Leo Dicaprio, but he is indeed commanding. He is one of those actors who can make himself seem bigger through his physical performance, and Leo has never felt this naturally big before. Tom Hardy also brings some a-game and knows how to be threatening through small nuances in his demeanour. The Revenant is a well shot movie, making great use of camera work and the same wide lens effects that aided Birdman but the problem is that mostly there is nothing to look at but scenery. Leo wanders through the wilderness for a long time, leaving the audience with nothing but a chilly feeling. The Revenant is meant to be a tale of revenge but there is no sense of drive or character motivation which makes it worth investing in. It's a clunky, and unmemorable film."
" Not bad...but read the book
",0.0,0.9568,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This is a good film. Its not great but it is good and i would recommend it. It isn't a patch on the book though. The film has very little similiarity to be honest. Apart from him being a trapper and getting mauled and seeking revenge thats it. There are far too many liberties taken with the plot details and back story in my opinion. The worst of these is his son. Typical Hollywood thinking we need to have our emotions tampered with. Also, he doesn't kill fitzgerald and the relationship with bridger is better explored. Reading the book gave me a much better sense of the scope of his injuries and his struggle to overcome them. Also the treatment he received was much better explained. The film gives the impression that all he had to stay in bed a bit. The book was much more of a struggle and his crawl to redemption was far more arduous.All in all its a decent film but a bit of a disappointment. Like the title says, read the book!"
" An Instant Classic
",0.0,0.9906,2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I will start by saying that this is possibly the most AMAZING looking film I have ever seen, every shot/scene is perfection, all the work put into this to shoot in natural lighting etc. really paid off.I saw it on the big screen and my wife and I were engrossed from beginning to end. After seeing what Glass goes through in the first third of the film you really feel his struggle and determination.The story is good, although a fairly simple one and is based on real life events. There is nothing complex here just a good survival/revenge tale which I think is all is needed here.A lot of reviews I've read say that nothing much happens in this film, but I have to disagree. It is a long film and a good portion is spent watching a man struggle, but it never becomes boring as you feel you are right there with him thanks to the amazing camera work. You also meet new characters along the way and there are a few tense action scenes littered through to break it up.Since the cinema I have watched it 4 more times and my opinion hasn't changed. It looks amazing, sounds incredible (you need a good home theater to appreciate it) and is very well acted and told.The soundtrack is awesome as wellThe Revenent will stick in my mind as a classic filmDo yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't already"

Iñárritu, definitely deserved an Oscar as well as Leonardo Decaprio, hands down. The most interesting thing in this film was that they never used lights. The D.O.P and the Director decided to use all natural lightening throughout the film which was incredible as it was perfectly lit. One amazing thing too, the horse scene was totally believable. Outstanding really! Not to mention the amazing bear scene which totally blow me away. I watched over and over again trying to analyze how it was done and i could never know so i had to browser the behind the scenes footage. One of the most amazing films and definitely deserved an Oscar. As an aspiring film maker myself, this is the kind of movies i'd like to do. Not a lot of dialogue lines and a great story throughout. Also, not to mention Tom Hardy's amazing performance."

Leo is a bad actor wow. to be honest, would of liked to of seen a young Shatner because he is an actor. and this isn't a nature documentary; this isn't a horror film, don't use cameras and audio like it is and you are a desperate freshman film student showing his 'chops'. and whoever wrote this or directed this.... its BAD. in not so many words, historical and natural inaccuracies throughout, cliché and failed homages, and it takes a lot more skill to 'break the fourth wall' (as is popular now) than was put into this piece of bullshit - 3/10"

It's like you are INTO it and the story - even thou not a happy one, its profoundly spiritual and makes you think in a new way about yourself, life and what's it's all about. If you've not seen it go do so. I am sure some people are not checking it out because the massive talk and awards to the film, but please do not hold that against it. Go see it with fresh eyes. Make up your own mind. And the scenery is just amazing. 4K resolution on the BlueRay version must be like out of this world."

But he soon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the wilderness. i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it turned out to be exceptional bad and boring - one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. How in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly funny movie get so good reviews ..? Sudently he stands up and walks and talks and crawles along this lengthy movie. I can see a purpose in this film but, my god it is weitten in capital letters"". I did not feel anything about him, just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing movie. What a turn off."

Scenes at the beginning of the movie are absolutely incredible from great way of filming them to camera movement which went throughout whole movie. Bear scenes it very intense and greatly shot but somewhere at the beginning of the attack it felt like unreal which kinda lost later on and looking at beginning of attack where bear was made to look big so it power of him was multiplied later it seemed like they decided to get him to normal size, that could be only camera work to make him look bigger and later like normal bear. From that point where Glass was left to mercy of Fitzgerald and his betrayal which buildup from beginning meant only one thing, that it is going to be a wild hunt. All adaptations and surviving of Glass is incredible and his power to get to Fitzgerald is incredible. As movie goes we are coming closer to their final moments and when it happened it was incredible. So much rage, power, hatred and sadness were in that final scenes that it was horrifying to watch. Filming of Revenant and scenes were pretty beautiful and almost every scenes followed with some kind of nature and wilderness shot is great. Effect of loneliness and isolation is constantly on your mind from beginning to the end. DiCaprio and Hardy were both magnificent and their performances were astonishing. Leo as Hugh Glass is destroyed mentally but hatred, pain and sadness are filled in every scene where he's in. Tom as Fitzgerald was pretty terrifying giving a very dark and cold performance that was filled with cynicism and bad behavior. Directing of the movie was pretty sweet and Alejandro proved his worth. 4/4"
" The Revenant Review
",0.0,0.9857,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Inspired by the story of American fur trapper and frontiersman Hugh Glass who survived a bear attack in the 1820s, Alejandro González Iñárritu created the exquisite and high-class masterpiece The Revenant (2015). The film's captivating screenplay by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu, the breath- taking landscape shots by the extraordinary cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the outstanding actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are responsible for my favourite cinematic experience of all time. A group of American trappers take part in an expedition along the Missouri river under Andrew Henry (Gleeson), when they are ambushed by Native American warriors. While the men try to get back cross-country, Hugh Glass (Oscar-winner DiCaprio) is mauled by a bear. John Fitzgerald (Hardy), although convinced Glass should be given the coup de grâce, and Jim Bridger (Poulter) agree to take him home for extra pay. However, the two leave Glass to die in the woods and return without him, telling everyone he was properly buried. Glass fights for survival and makes his way back to get revenge. The film's staggering narrative and storytelling fascinated me when I first watched the film in the cinema. Because of my interest in film-making, I immediately noticed Emmanuel Lubezki's brilliant work of cinematography; his using of sweeping widescreen lenses for his breath-taking landscape shots and close-ups, the phenomenal tracking shots and the ingenious lengthy takes with almost no apparent edits made me more than a spectator – I felt as if I was out there in the cold with Glass, trying to survive in the wilderness. The Revenant not only let me immerse in the film – I was a part of it. During those two hours, I forgot the world around me and the fact that I was sitting in a cinema, all due to Iñárritu's absorbing storytelling. Having adored Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in many films before, his performance in The Revenant topped everything I had ever seen because for this character he put emphasises on physicality rather than discourse. As Glass suffers – amongst other injuries – a wound to the throat which costs him his voice, DiCaprio acted merely through mimics, body language and occasional grunting, which left me speechless. Iñárritu's thrilling story about revenge against nature and against people is brilliantly told through excellent camera work and acting like I have never seen before and deserves its three Academy Awards."
