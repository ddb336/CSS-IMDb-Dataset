" Would we want to live in a world where every problem is solved?
",-0.0772,0.9697,2021-04-09 00:00:00,7,"A dying man gets transferred into a super advanced computer he created. His intelligence increases exponentially to the point this man/computer can heal all illnesses and wounds. The drawback is that those he heals he can also control, for the good of humanity of course. A rebel groups wants to stop the computer/man. Their solution is to produce a virus so powerful it destroys all online computers. Though not stated in the movie, I'm pretty sure it would lead to millions if not hundred of millions of deaths. What's interesting is the idea of what if a computer became so advanced it eventually solved everything? Would we as humans want that? You think of an idea, invention, a way forward but, too late, it's already been solved. Would humans be reduced to simple chores since the computer would do all the heavy lifting intellectually. Would a world where almost all problems are solved be worth living in? Anyway, I enjoyed the film."
" Decent on Depp's part as always, but not on the other qualities
",0.0,0.9395,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Transcendence was different, it made me think. And it was cool to see Depp play a genre of sci-fi, which is different from his usual roles, but of course he's versatile enough to portray them. As is common with the movies he's interested in, the plot and directing could certainly have been better but his acting per se never disappoints."
" 2 hours gone
",0.0,0.8024,2021-02-15 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie, but everything about it just trotting along. Nothing really about it got me all that interested and engaged in what was going on. After an hour into the film, nothing exciting happens. The movie has an interesting scifi premise to it, but that's about it. Also that blonde haired chick wore too much black eyeliner."
" A dreary sci-fi drama that feels watered down
",-0.34,0.5789,2021-02-12 00:00:00,5,"Transcendence should have been a one-hour episode of Black Mirror, not a two-hour movie. Despite the intriguing premise, impressive visuals, and interesting score, the story feels watered down. This dreary sci-fi film sleepwalks through most of the plot, arriving at conclusions the viewer has reached long before. It approaches being a fascinating drama, but never quite achieves this goal."
" Awesome story
",0.6249,0.8394,2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Just loved the movie. Can't stop thinking about the movie. Just one thing that reduces my rating 10 to 9 that is the control in soil, cloud etc is very over imagination. Except that All are very good."
" I should have known better
",0.4404,0.6486,2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,"Johnny Depp is only good when he can play a character who has one up on him. Otherwise, films with him are no fun because he packs the boredom he seems to have into his characters. ""Transcendence"" is such a film. Right at the beginning I asked myself what this Will Caster is actually trying to tell us, who is ghosting through the picture so sullenly and without facial expressions. Even after he dies, Depp's character neither develops charisma nor do his motives become clear. And here the film's script is also absolute nonsense. Rebecca Hall gets to play the victim, the path to purification is illogical, and that is ultimately how this film is."
" Misunderstood Brilliance
",0.3612,-0.4649,2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,"There's a moment in this movie when the AI Will in the body of his revived foreman approaches Rebecca Hall's character and tries to communicate with her. It's an important plot point, because it tells us that, regardless of the transcendance of an actual soul to PINN, the AI is not, still, self-aware.There's plenty of nuance in this movie that critics and viewers seem to have overlooked. Perhaps because we're used to the larger-than-life roles that Depp usually plays, we're laser-focused on his minimalist characterisation here. It's perfect, however, for the role--he's a soulless AI, after all, like HAL. But critics don't want that from Mr Depp. They want whacky outrageous flamboyance. And, so, they lost the plot.Extremists created the monster, killing the creator of PINN, only to have him become PINN. And then, of course, they all tried to take down the new PINN. This is an excellent movie, well worth a second or third look."
" Who is the good guy and who is the bad guy
",-0.1531,-0.6302,2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,"The movie is actually decently OK, but am I the only one who has problem with the premise who the good guys are who the bad guys are.
A supposedly good girl violates every safety protocol just because of her love for the husband who passed away and failure in her inability to see where this will lead turns people into cyborgs, resulting (at the end) in humanity returning back to the 19th century?
Or - do ""the terrorists"" actually happen to be the good guys - who want to prevent this?"
" Such a waste of time

But didn't have anything really that stellar, not very good script, didn't leave you on the edge of your seat, nor did it make you think to hard about the plot. But the content matter was good and the future of our world is set to change if we follow in the footsteps of our sci fi thrillers."
" Thus With a Kiss I Die - Or Do You?
",-0.2732,0.9743,2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"I never knew a science fiction thriller would play out a Romeo & Juliet ending. Very interesting how they pulled this off from a premise of AI. Many elements of this story I have seen before, its many science fiction story concepts thrown into one. This is not your typical Depp film but I can see him wanting to do a movie with an ending like this one. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a different but very well told science fiction thriller that takes many different routes to make its moral point. I feel the film was rather intelligent. Great cast by the way."
" Watch this space
",0.0,0.91,2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,Over recent decades science fiction has become science fact. This film explores that brilliantly. Great cast. This film makes you think....really think. It explores the realms of possibility. Definitely a love or hate movie but I loved it and it left me with deep thoughts. After all 50 years ago the thought of internet and mobile phones that could speak to people thousands of miles away were science fiction.
" Disappointing...so much potential
",0.0,-0.9454,2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the science fiction flick Transcendence (2014) starring the ever versatile, Johnny Depp along side with an ensemble cast including Rebecca Hall, Paul Bet, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman.The movie is about a new breakthrough in A.I. technology where Depp's character Dr Will Caster is working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything information ever known and is programmed with the full range of human emotions. His highly controversial experiments have made him famous world wife but also has been criticised and even targeted by anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. During a failed assassination attempt which Will survives however the bullet that hit him is radioactive poisoned and slowly his body deteriorates. Soon the attempt on his life unintentionally is the catalyst for the good Doctor to succeed in his life long work...-to be a participant in his own transcendence. His wife and his work colleague work around the clock to upload his mind into the computer that will allow him to continue his research. But as you would know anyone trying to adapt a 'Ghost in the Machine' ends with consequences... and that is what happens in the second half of the movie.Now my expectations were really high when I found out that Wally Pfister who for those Dark Knight trilogy and Inception fans is the usual suspect in cinematography for the genius Christopher Nolan - so pretty much I was looking forward to Pfister's directing debut especially considering past science-fiction and mind boggling films made by Nolan. Unfortunately this isn't the case with this movie. The director hit the nail with the cinematography in every level...but the story was a big letdown which even the A list cast couldn't bring the movie to something excellent which is a shame as the film is very ambitious with its premise but lets down in the second half and in the end. The script and the way the plot was handled was a big let down and wasted the talent the movie had. The consistency of the tone in the movie feels unbalanced and the pace if all over the place...fast and slow and goes to a different direction...in other words there was no consistency. The story doesn't go above the square box and explore different themes and ideas we the audience have not seen. Instead the story is familiar and to makes things worse make it complicated. The movie is okay but could have been so much more - overall disappointing 5.7/10"
" Tragic

" Scratching my head
",0.0,-0.6683,2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"What are these bad reviews about!? This movie is not concerned about any of the things critics is talking about. It would be the same as if you would judge a book by the font used in print.This is a nice movie, that tells its intended story nicely, it is watchable, communicable. I have followed the story, and since the reviews have lowered my expectations I was totally confused about the end result.
7.5 around that, probably, all together, or at least I watched far worse than this around that rating.Sorry, all bad reviewers, I badly disagree with you. I am not sure what anyone expected, that is another story, but sometimes can you try to watch something for what it is, not assuming how it should be?For what it is, the movie is good. Period."
" A superb introduction to transhumanism and the technological singularity...
",0.6249,0.9809,2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"The balance between technical accuracy and what is accessible and entertaining to a mainstream audience is always a difficult tightrope to walk for filmmakers venturing into cutting-edge subjects, but the producers of 'Transcendence' seem to have achieved a substantial measure of each. For people who are just being exposed to the concepts, the film touches on all of the main ideas and provides enough baby food for the uninitiated to form a seed of understanding.Because this film treads on a lot of touchy areas such as God and religion, creation, individuality and communalism, energy and environmentalism, and the fundamental question of what it means to be human, I see why the critical response has been polarized. I commend the filmmakers for venturing into this hotbed.Production-wise, as a big-budget film, it was nearly flawless: great casting and acting, unobtrusive cinematography, beautiful score, a better-than-functional plot, and dialog that was credible yet smoothly expository while developing the characters and moving the story forward. Some of choices to inject action into the film were a little over-the-top: exploding food; the FBI using artillery (really?); and the AI entity using spectacular, physical tactics to defend itself instead of using more nonviolent, covert manipulation and psych-ops to achieve its goals. And the zombie-apocalypse feel to some of the scenes were really beneath this project, but that's Hollywood...I was surprised to see Elon Musk do a cameo in this film. He's actually very cautionary toward the development of AI, and has warned about its dangers, but this film ultimately seems to take a position in favor of it. The casting of Rebecca Hall as Evelyn, the wife of the lead scientist, was a brilliant choice. She's perfect in the role, although the character is a little behind the times, portraying a more subservient female to the male lead. Johnny Depp handled the lead seemingly with ease, although the choice of using that ambiguous, polygenetic European accent as an American scientist was kind of weird and somewhat distracting.The film was pretty equitable with regard to the racial composition of the cast. Morgan Feeman had a substantial supporting role and another black actor, Cory Hardrict, played one of the terrorists -- not too many black extras in the background though, that I could see. Freeman's character was juxtaposed with some negative scenes, however, such as a terrorist attack and on a couple of occasions he delivered sad messages and gestures of condolence. And he opposed the protagonists throughout most of the story. But he also had dialog that delivered some good news at one point, so overall I guess it was racially progressive given current Hollywood standards.The film has taken quite a few hits critically with regard to its technical accuracy, but most of those criticisms are not deserved and have been made in ignorance. Maybe I'll do another separate review here someday with spoilers explaining why many of the events depicted in this film are actually very possible and credible.Overall, it's a great film -- easily an 8/10, and with its racial diversity I'll give it a rating of 9/10.Rating 9/10; (submitted July 31, 2020, 5:35 p.m. EDT)"
" Transcendence Review
",0.0,0.9787,2020-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, I did not hear about this movie until I saw it on a list of possible choices for a school project, but I was not disappointed in my choice. It was somewhat action filled and made me think. The main technological topic discussed was artificial intelligence and connecting human intelligence with technology, but they do not go into much detail about how the technology is used. Dr. Will Caster gives a speech about his uses of the artificial intelligence, which all include making the world a better place, but he goes a little overboard and thirsts for more knowledge and more power. It gets to the point where the characters become unsure if they can stop the technology. This movie brings about questions of ethics about how far is too far with the use of technology and is pretty entertaining while doing so."
" Too complex, it lacks a coherent script and a capable director.
",0.3818,0.9602,2020-06-24 00:00:00,3,"This sci-fi film is quite interesting, as it gives you a lot to think about after seeing it. It was devastated by the critics and very badly received by the public and I even understand the reasons, in that it is not good and has serious problems, but let's face it: there are much worse films that break box office records and bring the critics to their knees.The script is complex and requires attention: everything happens around Dr. Will Caster, a scientist who, together with others, wants to create artificial intelligence similar to human beings, who understands things instead of just quantifying them and calculate solutions, like machines do. The idea would have different applications in terms of medicine, education, defense etc. but it opens a Pandora's box of ethical, moral and religious issues, and that bothers a lot of people. After an attack and in the face of certain death, Dr. Caster's wife decides to take the decisive step and insert her husband's memories, conscience and personality into the supercomputer on which they had been working. Thus, after his death, the machine creates an artificial intelligence that resembles the late scientist in everything, except in the absence of soul and ethical scruples.There is a lot of complexity in this film, so it is not suitable for those who are not willing to think and pay attention. However, little by little, the film lost and wraps itself in an increasingly complex plot, leading to an action climax that would seem, at first, exaggerated and uninteresting. This loses consistency and logic. But the film succeeds in launching topics for discussion at the level of science, religion, morals and ethics. After all, the cybernetic entity created in this film is truly the creation of a human and cybernetic god, omnipresent and omniscient. The film is rich in subjects to debate and it is worth seeing it in this light.Directed by Wally Pfister, who is best known for his work in cinematography, it has a good cast, full of well-known names. However, the lack of a coherent story and structured direction has greatly hampered their work. Rebecca Hall is the actress who receives better material to work with and the result is that she works better and shows more talent than the rest. Paul Bettany is usually a safe bet, but he doesn't seem to know what to do here. Morgan Freeman is uninspired and Johnny Depp does nothing more than say the lines and show his face. Kate Mara and Cillian Murphy don't have time to do much.Technically, it is a regular film. We have regular CGI and good sets and landscapes, in addition to a very good cinematography, where we can see the attention of the director, who understands that much more than script and direction. In fact, when we finish this film, we easily conclude that it is a film that promises a lot and looks very good at the beginning, but it develops so badly and wants to be so much that, in conclusion, it ends up being nothing. All because of a bad director and a bad scriptwriter. It is a pity."
" Faith lost...
",0.4215,0.5423,2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"Great movie, which displays the weaknesses we open by trusting others, especially driven by logic and feelings. That stupid code we are born with, between right and wrong.
However humanity keeps hoping for a better future, without asking themselves if they deserve one and what would they do with it."
" I so much wanted to rate this Sci-Fi flick higher, but it chickened out in the end.
",0.0,0.5286,2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"Ultimately, ""Transcendence"" was a significant disappointment to me, although I'm not an ordinary reviewer. I like science fiction movies, but I'm well-educated in both the hard and soft sciences. I especially dislike interstellar travel, ""warp drive"", anti-gravity whatevers, and stuff that blatantly demonstrate a lack of the real limits that will almost certainly always confound human beings.With regard to this movie, it is very helpful to understand that I've been extremely hammered by a genetic disease for 25 years. Until you've walked a few decades in my shoes, shut up about ""designer babies"" or ""playing God"" or whatever. I'm hurting badly and it's not getting any better. One single deleterious gene mutation can wreak havoc your life. If the gene has no reason for being in the gene pool (other than an accident of evolutionary history or random mutation), getting it out isn't a bad thing. It's easy to name numerous genetic diseases that fit this bill.Truly strong artificial intelligence produces many philosophical conundrums and is a lot further away in the future than many people seem to be aware (I'm talking about you Elon). Also, even with CRISPR technology coming on strong, biology is hard. I'll vouch for that, only too painfully. This movie works off of a scenario that may well be in the distant future, but it's not going to be in my lifetime, even though ideally I might survive a few more decades. Still, overall, the issues raised are ones that humans are actually starting to face currently, which makes it timely and interesting.My big problem with this film is that the last half-hour goes all Hollywood, throws hard and uncomfortable science out the window, and goes for a nice poetic ending. This is where the movie could have really distinguished itself from so many others in the past. It would have been much more thoughtful and enlightening if, instead of culminating in completely nonsensical, unscientific, feel-good fluff, the movie would have pushed on to the face the ultimate possibility that nature may truly be as cruel as it appears to be. Call me. I'll be a witness for the prosecution."
" A very successful beautiful scenario
",0.8508,0.7496,2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,The actors and the movie budget are very good and the movie is well-crafted. It sheds a good light on how the future of humanity will be. A movie that deserves to be watched as much as possible.
" Fascinating glimpse into a theoretical use for AI.
",0.5423,0.6059,2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie, I feel it's where we should be going with AI, not as something to replace us, but to allow us to move beyond our current physical limitations."
" A unique, intelligent movie
",0.4588,0.8968,2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie will be liked by most people interested in the ethical dilemmas surrounding AI. I feel that this movie will be more highly appreciated by people actually in STEM positions as it seems to be targeted at that audience. I actually don't understand why the ratings are as low as they are, it probably deserves at least a 7"
" Nothing new or interesting
",-0.3089,-0.2042,2020-04-28 00:00:00,3,"Transcendence has a distinct been-there-done-that feel to it. I've seen so many stories with this kind of mad scientist plot, so I was decidedly bored while watching. It's not that there is anything outright terrible in the film, with the possible exception of Johnny Depp's mustache-twirling performance. He needs to act at least somewhat normal to convince me that Rebecca Hall isn't questioning his altruism right away. Other than the script letting her down, I actually thought Hall gave a brilliant performance in the film, and I believed a lot of the emotion she showed. Most of the other actors seemed like incidental window dressing that did nothing more than keep the plot moving forward. The hardest part to accept about Transcendence is the lack of defined rules or boundaries on the abilities of Digital-Depp. At times it seems he is omnipotent, but then they seem to arbitrarily hold back his power whenever they need someone to oppose him. The end of the film proves that the filmmakers were a bit too full of themselves and tried to make something more profound than they earned. It's not a total train-wreck of a film, as I was expecting based on word of mouth, but it's also not worth watching particularly if you've seen films with similar plotlines before."
" poor performance
",-0.4767,-0.1779,2020-04-20 00:00:00,4,"The story has potential for a good film, but little has been implemented in the plot here. The film only bored me from minute 30."
" Though-provoking, but it doesn't live up to its potential.
",0.0,0.9379,2020-04-17 00:00:00,6,"While Transcendence presents the audience with an interesting moral dilemma, the film fails to live up to what it could have. The film examines the dangers of pushing the boundaries of modern technology. Like Jurassic Park, Transcendence questions the idea that technological progress is always beneficial. Interestingly, Transcendence's conclusion to this problem is not entirely resolved by the end of the film. Dr. Caster is portrayed as the villain towards the end of the film, yet his vision for the world is quite utopian. Once he is transcended, he can create a world with out disease or pollution. The only trade off is that humanity would become a his personal race of slaves. Yet, once Will is killed, humanity is left much worse off. So a trade-off emerges: live free in a world with out technology or be slaves to technology in a perfect world. Additionally, Caster comes off as a misunderstood beast. Once transcended, the military and RIFT depict him as a monster who will enslave the world, but he appears as good, kind person. So the audience must decide his true personality and motivations. Perhaps, the A.I. at the end of the film is lying and is not really Will. All in all, the dilemma regarding our dependance technology and the progression of new tech is well done, fascinating, and gives the audience a lot to consider.However, the film as a whole could have been much better. From the score to the dialogue to the cinematography, Transcendence is just bland. Much more could have been made out of the film's visual symbolism.The film could have been very unique in all these areas, but ends up being simply uninspired. Altogether, Transcendence is an above average film with a thought-provoking theme, but lackluster dialogue and cinematography."

Unfortunately this movie quits them after an hour or so.What keeps amazing me - or actually it doesn't, at all - is the way that the American film industry has the ability to turn even the most promising ideas into something that demands cars crashing and flying up in the air, people riding monster trucks with machine guns, and nowadays even zombies to grow out of ground.Is there really not any other way to project dystopian fears than your age-old imagery of the wild west, like people ambushing others on rooftops?I don't even care to mention all the obvious loopholes (like the greatest intelligence ever not figuring out a way to spare the rest of the World from collapsing, although its vision originally was to make the World a better place?).Cinematographically pleasing, some great FX, but what a waste of cast - and my time.

",0.1852,0.6797,2020-03-05 00:00:00,9,"Not sure why the hate for this movie, I thought it was great.Transcendence is more of an art film exploring different scientific and philosophical concepts more than anything. It was not a film trying to become a Hollywood blockbuster. Transcendence showcases us a world that could be with characters that could exist. It continues pressing for different answers to questions that make us question our own place in the world.What makes us human? Will an artificial machine uploaded with our consciousness be us? Does it have an inherent soul at that point? If not, what makes humans so special? The list goes on and on.If I had to rate this film, I'd give it a 4.5/5. It's worth a rewatch and reexamining."

As someone here in the comments put it very well: ""people are afraid of what they do not understand"". It could summarize this movie, but then you would loose the beauty and the poetry it posesses. Yes, it is there. Some hated it, maybe because they expected a sci-fi movie. Period. But for me it offers more than just that, and it is far more profound. The sensation I got was that this is actually a philosophical, even spiritual movie, disguised into a sci-fi. The mind behind it I find it brilliant and it delivered well the message, the acting is brilliant, the scenes are very well made and it does have some thrills and emotions and momentum. But underneath all of these, there stands eternal and universally asked questions and reflection about love, faith, life in general. I really loved it."
" Very worthy movie
",0.4927,0.9916,2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of science fiction films: usually there's too much fiction in them, and their attitude to real life is too small, and they are often overloaded with all kinds of special effects, believing that this will make an incredible impression on the audience. But I liked this movie. A very interesting story: in my opinion, quite complicated, but not overloaded with unnecessary details. A very worthy cast, especially pleasant on the screen Johnny Depp, starring in one of the main characters.
I won't say that I would advise this film, answering the question ""what to watch at my leisure"", but, perhaps, being requested to advise a film in a similar genre I would respond to watch this one. Everything is in measure, starting from the number of fantastic details and frills in the storyline, ending with the trivial length of the movie and desire to watch.

" Pretentious plot with unlikable characters and grey visuals.
",0.0516,-0.9645,2019-12-19 00:00:00,3,"Everything this movie tries to tell us has been done before and generally better.What if AI becomes self conscious / what if human becomes machine are story lines done to death at this point. The movie acts like we have never seen any of this before but we did.The characters are all bland and uninteresting. Johnny Depp clearly phones his performance in as he just has to be in it for the start and the end of the movie and in between he is just a voice over.The CGI in this movie is especially boring to look at. It's like transformers: grey machines morphing in front of brown and grey backgrounds. Except here there is no action to distract from how bad it looks.The character motivations and actions make no sense. The scientist that helps Evelyn Caster build the AI, is instantly convinced that it is evil seconds after turning it on. He even joins the terrorists that in the beginning killed all his friends. Completely all over the place doesn't do it justice.Editing wise this movie is also really bad. The opening scene is images of a world without computers where discarded electronics are lying in the street and people wonder how they gonna live now. That is a flash forward to the end of the movie so you are spoiled from the start what is gonna happen.It looks like a movie made by a film student and not Nolan's cinematographer."

I've watched Transcendence dozens of times and enjoyed every moment, I don't know why the 6 stars. I feel ashamed for these harsh critics and bad reviews - just negative people writing about things they don't understand.Transcendence is a film that depicts an inevitable future of the world as we know it, foreseeing the path we humans are headed. In this day in age our congested societies continue to grow, demolish and consume. Our ongoing research and development of A.I., Nanotech and Robotics will help us heal our planet. The world is dying in it's current state, we humans are overpopulating and killing it.. Technology will help us save it.Think about this - who do you know doesn't have a smart phone or personal computer these days? Ask yourself do you really need one - for work, for school, for travel, for home. Can you live without one? Can the world? How about hospitals, airlines, businesses, law enforcements? It's simple, we need technology, it will evolve, and we will evolve with it.Yes, Transcendence is a big budget Hollywood film with A-grade actors, good story telling and superb visual effects, which I love.. but it's also a film inspired by real technology we use today and its rapid growth. It reminds us that technology has only ever HELPED humanity, not destroy us - we do that to ourselves.Many people do not yet understand how REAL the technology shown in this film will actually be to our existing world.. Our Technology is headed down this path, we need to embrace it but we won't see it for another 30-40 years.. hence, Transcendence is Ahead of it's time."
" Great classic SF, ruined a tidge by dumb studio choices
",-0.3182,-0.8791,2019-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Biggest problem with this film is the opening few minutes. Maybe the marketing also.I suspect that the few other things I did not 100% love about it were similarly from stupid studio meddling to try to appeal to the stupid among us.SPOILERS FOLLOW:
The story, in order, naturally evolves delightfully. People doing stuff, then terrorists, then things change, then risk of death leads to a risky chance, which then changes the world.For the better? Frankenstein-become-monster keeps saying so, but can we trust him? He seems to have taken free will from some folks. But has he? How bad is what he's doing? It is worth destroying, with artillery?The opener gives away the global scale of what the movie is about. Which then ruins it, and makes it seem like a post-apocalyptic, or superhero save-the-world film. Whereas it's a classic ""soft"" SF about the scope of power, intention, and of course, a lot of it is driven by emotion."
" A Techno-Sci Fi A.I. Success
",0.5719,0.9934,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"30 May 2016. Johnny Depp stars in a techno, psychological, sci fi thriller that eschews the loud big blockbuster action summer movie phenomenon. Instead Depp finds himself in a more subdued cerebral movie that envelopes its audience through the pure terror of the tantalizing possibility of its actually coming true. Conceptually the idea of ""transcendence"" is ominously feasible and just as John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) which raised the possibility of anything living, even your best friend or lover, could be a monster, Transcendences reverberates with the innate psychological fear that one day artificial intelligence might easily come to fundamentally change the very fabric of our existence.Transcendence is among a number of contemporary artificial intelligence movies that have begun to dissolve the barrier between humans and computers. Instead of the earlier safe and clear boundaries between human minds and computer intelligence of such movies as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Westworld (1973), Wargames (1983), Cherry 2000 (1987), or Stepford Wives (2004), Transcendence and other contemporary movies have proposed a different fusion of sorts. This morally ambiguous transformation looms large in Transcendence and Is well exploited in a way that the classic Bladerunner (1982), Robocop (1987), or Bicentennial Man (1999) only suggest.This movie captivates and haunts the audience by involving the audience in a looming hypothetical proposition that directly threatens each one of us individually instead of keeping its distance in such movies as Soldier (1998), Splice (2009) or Ex-Machina (2015). In the vein of The Machine (2013) and Lucy (2014), in Transcendence, the audience is bombarded with an array of technology that could result in a paradigm shift in what it means to be human and the movie succeeds in maintaining the ambiguous balance of ethical uncertainty until the very end. Transcendence succeeds to raising important questions about science and humanity in a very intimate and meaningful way and raises the bar on the psycho, sci-fi thriller genre much like Interstellar (2014) and winner of the best Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror films award did for space exploration and now for the future of artificial intelligence."
" Transcendental stupidity
",-0.4404,-0.8769,2019-01-09 00:00:00,3,"I knew Hollywood's take on augmented intelligence was going to be a stinker - but they really butchered this one, took a steaming dump onto the pile of tripe that was left, and smeared the result all over a nice expensive camera lens. At least when Hollywood was exploiting people's fears of new technology in Lawnmower Man, the progression from simpleton to malicious bad guy was sort of plausible. Here, it seems the only reason the superbrain (which has to be one of Depp's most miscast and doofy roles) was thrust into the role of the antagonist is because the Defense Department was not in control of him/it. Apart from one particular ethically questionable application of super-advanced technology - which honestly could have easily been prevented if his wife just sat down and, you know, discussed ethics and limits with him (aren't they both supposed to be smart or something?) - the superbrain did absolutely nothing evil or wrong. The hostility from the government stemmed solely from their assumptions and projections, i.e. ""if we had this kind of power, clearly the only thing we'd want to do is take over the world and enslave everyone.""The price for taking out the Depp-bot is the shutdown of the entire global Internet infrastructure (no spoilers here, the movie already does that for you by opening with this aftermath). The world gets set back a hundred or so years and everyone lives under martial law - what a grand victory for humanity! Because trying to negotiate with an AI is even more unthinkable than negotiating with terrorists or something.There are literally dozens of other plot points and character decisions that are so laughably contrived and stupid that it really makes one long for the days when the human idiots who write this sort of nonsense will be replaced by some sort of chimp-infused quantum AI screenwriting algorithm. If you want to kill two hours of your life watching something mindless, I suggest you watch a Godfrey Ho ninja film like Ninja Terminator for infinitely more awesomeness and truly transcendental entertainment value."

Not only do I agree with the reviews here saying that the government would probably have war as the LAST item on their list, I also just... could NOT understand the characters' motivations.So the science dudes who were Evelyns friends come down to check the lab out. Sure, the computer is only half Will and makes them a lil uncomfy. But he shows them wonders of tech that could save millions. Cure cancer. Make natural disasters no longer disasters. Remove poverty. No more death. And their ONLY thought? ""RUN EVELYN! HE CAN CONTROL PEOPLE OCCASIONALLY! SO SCARY!""They weren't even planning on keeping any of the research he did after he died. You're telling me the government wasn't even the sliiightest bit interested in cell regeneration? Come on. Every capitalist on Earth would be jumping to steal that and market it. If they left Will alone, he would have just gave it to the world for free to better mankind. But noooo. Instead they just kill him. Because it made them nervous that he could control people if need be. Ugh.I don't understand why the wife was so upset and scared? I understood that she'd be upset once realizing that this robot is not the same Will, but... why did him saving people upset her? Oh no. My husband is doing what sweet baby Jesus did. So morally wrong! He didn't even take away their free will.I'm so tired of movies like this, where something amazing or different totters along and humans are like ""the world just isn't ready.""

It is a frustrating in parts as it can be misread as some sort of science fiction mad scientist taking over the world. Well if that is all anybody sees that is unfortunate. I am firm believer of life after death through the elements that make up our earth and this film taos into that. Definitely worth a go

" A High Concept Bore
",-0.25,-0.8973,2018-11-20 00:00:00,6,"I couldn't include spoilers if I wanted to, because this movie went right past me. I normally don't like high concept sci fi movies, such as INCEPTION and other films that push the boundaries of reality very far. Not that I'm a realist, but sometimes it feels like too much work to grasp. But with a movie like INCEPTION, you can turn the sound down and it's still a visually interesting movie to watch. Not so with this movie. It was slow, quiet, subdued, and monotone throughout. I just didn't connect, and it was a chore to get through. I give it 6 out of 10 because it was a reasonably good execution. 4s and 5s are used for bad filmmaking. This movie wasn't bad, it just left me with nothing to appreciate."
" Good movie, but a lot of holes in the reasoning...
",0.2382,0.9958,2018-11-12 00:00:00,5,"So, I don't understand why the writers of this movie went the way they did with this movie. Why it left more questions than answers.The movie starts off a bit slow, but when it gets interesting it stays interesting. I give a thumbs up for that. Johnny Depp's character only has a short time to live, and his wife and him decide to upload his mind to the world wide web. Once you start to see all of the connections the computer is making, you soon realize that it has the power and know-all to simply do anything...especially when we get to the part where the computer can scan the wife to analyze her hormone and biological responses. It can create things and rebuild things from the sophisticated nano-technology it advanced. It created a human copy of itself. It cures people and makes them stronger and smarter with ability to self-heal.So with all of that said, why in quite a few scenes, it shows the people trying to rise up against it, when by all rights, it should have detected their very thoughts from the start, thus preventing anything happening, as well it probably should have foreseen the human response and thus prevented things from progressing. The resistance was able to sneak upon its base of solar panels and blow them up....really? Any human would realize that motion detectors would have done wonders, but a super AI wouldn't think to protect itself even better?As the machine gets smarter and changes its own code to evolve with itself, and noticing the power it attains to do this, you realize this machine would be capable of anything. So what governs its actions? Intelligence. Gathering intelligence of life, the planet, the universe even. The character of Will would have gotten left behind as the computer upgraded itself over and over and over again. So why did the movie try to add in exploits by humans when you know that those exploits even would have been prevented with the machine being so powerful as it was, probably starting with the wife first.As such, I was let down. 5+ stars for effort and great acting. -5 stars for allowing the impossible to happen."
" Interesting premise, final act could have been better
",0.6808,0.9024,2018-11-05 00:00:00,7,"I have to wonder what is up with all the 1/10 reviews and people saying this movie was boring and illogical. First of all, it's science fiction - if you want 100% realism why are you even watching this movie? Second of all, I found the film to be decently suspenseful and effective. The premise is interesting, if maybe a bit derivative of films like The Lawnmower Man. But most movies owe something to other works, so this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Most people saying this movie made no sense can't seem to adequately explain what they mean by that - perhaps because it does in fact make sense.The only place I feel the film really falters is late in the final act, where the script kind of loses direction. Some of the actions of the characters towards the end don't really seem to add up, and I'm still not sure I understand why things played out the way they did. Still, I would say the film is still very much worth watching, and I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging it was. If you want some sort of documentary on AI, as some of the reviewers here apparently did, then obviously look elsewhere. If you want a thought-provoking sci-fi thriller, then you can do a lot worse than this film."
" I THINK THEREFORE I AM
",0.0,-0.2047,2018-10-21 00:00:00,6,"The film starts out in Berkley and there is no electrical power...anywhere, perhaps. It then flashes back 5 years as there is a clash between ""neo-Luddites"" and those that want to create artificial intelligence. Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) has the last project that wasn't destroyed...although he himself took a bullet laced with radioactive polonium and is now dying.Will's wife and colleague Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) has the idea of sticking an electrode in Will's brain and uploading him to the computer. Will connects to the Internet and unlocks secrets of nanotechnology. He wants to use the knowledge to cure the sick, clean the air, clean the water, regrow forests, and create an army of followers with brain implants. He would become a ""God"" which scares a whole bunch of people.The special effects were decent, but not overwhelming. Johnny Depp was lifeless in his role, as are too many science fiction characters. The film asks several questions to ponder, such as how will we know when a computer has consciousness? What are the limits we will allow robots to control our lives?The film utilizes nanotechnology, perhaps beyond its limits. There is a new generation of devices coming out using new substances such as graphene which will make everything we own obsolete. BTW, Government facilities such as depicted in the film utilizes iris scans in Top Secret areas and not simple card swipes.This is a slow paced cerebral science fiction film that is not for everyone.Parental Guide: No f-bombs that I recall. No nudity. Brief covered sex scene."

" Important and very enjoyable movie
",0.6115,0.9985,2018-08-20 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie, and didn't find the physics impossible as I imagine people disliking the movie would think. Sure, with the knowledge we have now maybe a bit of a stretch, but no one knows every answer to the physics of the observable universe. And surely no one knows anything about the other side of the expansion of the universe. Completely different physics are present. Refer to the expansion of the universe being faster than the speed of light, which contradict the laws of physics of our universe, but remember the expansion is not part of our universe, merely the edge, so to say.I realise consciousness is a hard topic to cover, what is it? But I use the word to describe choices made in the human spirit, emotional attachment to the choice. The movie does a great job of not trying to answer the impossible question.How could this have been a 9/10 movie for me?
The only thing that I thought was unrealistic was the plot surrounding the virus. The virus should have been pointless in the end since Will made a conscious(if you ask me) choice to honor Evelyn by not letting the terrorist Bree kill the innocent Max Waters and inject the virus to shut down all of his system (which the virus wouldn't be strong enough to do, read further down). He could just have shut down by choice, instead of injecting the virus. He could have saved Evelyn and shut down afterwards. They use the virus too aggressively.In the actual plot the virus isn't pointless because it's used as a way to honor Evelyn. It's not that the virus could be pointless, if the plot had been different, that I'm not fond of the idea. It's because it's unlikely that humankind would be stupid enough to think that a virus would be able to penetrate the defense of a super intelligence. It's just never gonna happen. Because Will(the super intelligence) isn't confined anymore, he's out on the internet, and probably has rewritten his own ""source code"" to prevent attacks, so the fact that they wanted to use an old code against him is just super unlikely to happen.In a way they gave the virus a life in the story, because I really like how the whole movie kinda turned around when I thought he was just a lost unconscious machine with 1 goal to expand. But it turned around and the morale of the story became a plot twist in which Will was actually conscious and cared more for Evelyn and her goals to better the human species and protect its natural environment, than he did for expanding.So yea it's horrible that the virus worked, but they made up for it with that sweet plot twist. Kind of how I see the movie Ex Machina (2014), which has an open ending. A lot of people see the ending in Ex Machina, as Ava (the robot AI) being an unconscious killer machine that broke free. But I see it different. I see that she was conscious, broke free and see the beauty in the world. There are subtle hints for me throughout the movie.Back to Transcendence
If it should be a 9/10 movie for me I would have made it so that Will keeps expanding and all of humanity become nothing but rearranged atoms, as a result of his goals(so sad but amazing, with a very non-Hollywood ending). And the virus shouldn't have worked. Sure the movie could have flourished with hope for humanity, but in the end it should end badly for humanity (Could have been a great ending worthy of someone like Christopher Nolan).How would this be a 10/10 movie for me?
Now, I really like indie films, but if we keep it non-indie what should happen?
First of all it would need a different art direction. So that you really felt you sat down and watched and listened to something absolutely beautiful, with a greater meaning and amazing cinematography. A huge budget and probably Christopher Nolen as director and perhaps Bear McCreary, John Williams or Hans Zimmer as music composers. For sure it would need totally different music. Gotta make the whole atmosphere and feeling of the music more dystopic and dramatic.I also really like the Elon Musk cameo, a great way to put attention to the issue of not understanding AI and thinking forward to prevent disasters, just as you would with nuclear power. Nuclear is just potentially less dangerous and less beneficial for mankind than AI.Thanks for reading."

" neither a success nor a disaster
",-0.6903,0.9252,2018-07-08 00:00:00,5,"""Transcendence"" is, for the most part, a science fiction movie about the birth of artificial intelligence. It's not the most successful member of this category, mainly because the story tends to wander and meander to the point where the message (if indeed there is a message) becomes unclear. The movie is also pretty superficial when it comes to dealing with some of the underlying societal, philosophical and religious themes. It is slightly more moving and gripping as a story about bereavement and the ravages of grief. The distraught widow belongs to a very recognizable type : the kind of person who cannot face the cruelty of her loss and begins to erect an enormous, stupendous funeral monument, Because This Is What He Would Have Wanted. Of course the deceased never expressed such a wish, but this won't keep the widow from building an 800-feet tall pyramid surrounded by sphinxes, lighthouses and canals. Seasons come and seasons go but the widow never recovers : even years later she is still there, burning incense to an idol which requires every second of her time and attention... On the other hand I quite liked the visual style and aspect of the movie. To me it felt as if there had been some genuinely original and inventive persons on the payroll. In a better movie, with a tauter story and screenplay, this could have made for memorable scenes.Johnny Depp, I am happy to say, delivered a fairly good performance, without resorting to tics and tricks. In short : a fairly average and unremarkable movie, to be watched mainly if you want to kill an hour or two."
" Like it or not AI IS where we're going.
",0.3612,-0.8225,2018-05-20 00:00:00,10,"35+ years writing software code ... starting w/ Cobol and ending w/ C#. Watched 
Neural Networks and ""AI"" all through my career. ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"", ""The Matrix"", etc, have tried to get people to think about what's coming. Until now the tools weren't up to the task that Jonny Depp's character and his Wife envisioned. The next step to human evolution is thru AI period. Face it, I was coding with a 1953 OS that had a pitiful upgrade process. All human coders are faced with the same limitation. However, now with the internet and all the computer scientist, bio-engineers, and human genome decoders out there publishing their results it's only a matter of time before someone releases some type of viable AI into the wild. THIS IS WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT !!!!! Wake up, we need to start thinking & talking hard about how we want this AI to behave, This movie was couched in the EVIL AI GENRA, I suspect that AI had to be the bad guy before it could make it to the big screen as a third rate movie at best. Sheeple don't like change, it scares them and according to this movie they would rather destroy all the wonderful things we've developed over the last 50 years just to keep radical change from happening. Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) could have simply cured people and foregone networking them and giving them super powers but the networking and super powers was the functional cinematic reason he had to be stopped. The point is he cured people that currently have incurable disabilities. The Authorities could have chosen to talk first BEFORE shooting. Ah, but again AI and Change have to be the bad guys. But bad guys that cure Smog, Clean our Water, Recharge our depleted soil, Breakdown our garbage to useful elements, etc. What's bad about THAT !!! Yes there are risks to change, there are ALWAYS risks to change. However, the Authorities could have said to Dr. Caster, ""Dude it's cool to heal all these people, it's even cool if you ask them and they choose to be enhanced. BUT we're NOT OK with all the people you fix being automatically networked. They should be asked if they want to be BORG and they should be given a Network OFF Switch. Isaac Asimov wrote the ""3 laws"" in 1950. It's not like we haven't been thinking about this stuff. I couldn't give a hoot about whether the movie was great or sucked (I realize this IS IMDB - but for me this is too great a movie message to reduce to cinematic chat.) P.S. you can bet the Weapons development people restarted the site immediately after it was under Authoritarian control. The point of all this - CHANGE WILL HAPPEN - GET USED TO IT - GET A HANDLE ON IT."
" Interesting Premise, But Poorly Executed.
",0.2144,0.6711,2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Transcendence. This is the movie equivalent to phoning it in. It has an interesting premise, if just don't think too much about the logic. But it's ruined by lame dialogue being spouted by actors phoning it in, and it ends with an all too predictable ending!! I complain when a film develops a semi intriguing story and then dissolves it with a routine and boring action sequence. And this is a prime example of such a thing!! I guess it must be contractual that every director who makes a thriller these days must blow his sets to bits. This movie was better when the story scales down and let's you think about things. How much freedom and security have we already given up to the internet in the last 10 years?? We get Facebook adverts tailored to what we have discussed in messages or searched for on eBay?? And on and on. And we are ok with this?? There is a current investigation about Facebook selling private info. How much more will we sacrifice in the next 10?? The movie worked better, when it was on that level.The acting is really nothing special, Depp (in nothing more than a supporting role) appears bored and seems his mind was elsewhere (maybe counting the $20 million he was paid) possibly spent less than 7 days on set. Morgan Freeman is also in phone it in mode too!! Transcendence grossed $23 million at the domestic box office."

" A good movie but could be better
",0.7003,0.9988,2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Greetings,With so many great production values and the overall ""what if"" scenario the script is about, I wanted to comment a little. A few of many moments that could have been written better. Lots of ending spoilers if you haven't seen it. Don't read further etc if you happen to come across my post first. Go for it after seeing the movie. You smile maybe.Martin the contractor (Clifton Collins Jr) gets shot in the tunnel after they trapped him behind the metal screen, AKA a Faraday Cage to prevent RF/WIFI communications, thus the naans could not regenerate him. So why not TASER him instead of shooting eventually leading to his death? More dramatic I suppose making the 'good guys' look really bad for fear of the unknown. Maybe that anything at all costs mentality was what they were going for. But that's for a '50s B movie which a lot of the reviewers went for. A TASER then a drug to keep him unconscious would have said, ""OK, we've got a big problem but will save humans when we can"". That would have added a little more humanity to the good guys making their cause more understandable as well as believable.Bree the terrorist girl (Kate Mera) threatens to kill the virus guy Max (Paul Bettany) unless Will (Johnny Depp) took the virus. Later Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) says to Will, ""We can't let him die for what we did"". I get it but really detracted from an outstanding ending. The whole point was all the knowledge of an exceptional human combined with the unlimited resources of worldwide computer capabilities could not understand the abstracts of love, emotions and human frailties thus will take over the planet and pretty much make us all Borgs! So shoot first and ask questions later! We're back to a B movie with great state-of-the art visuals. Heck, Data (Brent Spiner) with his emotions chip had to suffer through this with ST:TNG for years! They are doing great in syndication!What made the ending outstanding was the relationship between Will and Evelyn. Why did Will (the computer version) touch the blood of Evelyn thus the virus knowing it would end him? It certainly wasn't about Bree. The writers also went for a later explanation Will wanting to be together forever with Evelyn in a garden. Evelyn felt in her final moments that the live Will she knew and loved was there. Not a bad way to go.Thus it leaves the audience hanging and thinking. Can a computer in our future ever learn to love? Would it know the difference for regenerating the planet for all our human failures and still allow humans find their way? Would humans at our current level take advantage of these new technologies for their own goals? This is great writing and Isaac Asimov, Robert Henlein and a few others would be proud.Someone once said there are only 200 scripts in Hollywood. They just keep doing them over. Too many producers today are more about a political or social point they want to make wanting you to pay big money to see them. Ever seen a great positive movie about a Republican President in Hollywood? Won't happen today. What is a great movie? I think the 1947 movie ""Miracle on 34th Street"" by 20th Century Fox which won several Academy awards should have won for best picture but didn't. Some trivial a Hollywood company it was their second movie ever filmed in NYC. They did well. Still it is played every Christmas and you'll have to look up the movie that won!I love 'what if' movies. Done right they are entertaining, give us the magic being immersed in the movie for two hours (versus our real lives), touch the emotions of hopefully ALL the audience and gives us something to wonder about leaving the theater. The more movies you see the more you add to this personal list. 'Transencence' while having flaws many have already posted about is one of these...but then that is me. You decide.Hope that I got all the actors right trying my best. One could rob a store I was in and if you weren't my mother I couldn't identify you! :)Regards"
" A good idea wasted
",-0.0772,0.9896,2017-12-11 00:00:00,3,"Not even Depp can save this script, which is almost completely in the pathetic, mixing some elementary ideas from movies like ""Lawnmover Man"" (1992) and also a storytelling style from not so well-done movies like ""Independence Day"" (1996). Unfortunately the storytelling is at par with the latter, full of logical errors, totally overblown exaggerated technical assumptions based on very little if anything, twists that leave the viewer without explanation and plot holes big enough to fly a Boeing 727 trough. It's sad that the makers, when having a chance to address the relevant and very real problems and virtues with AI and Nano Technology, they allow this opportunity to be wasted on a tepid story where alleged highly intelligent people acts more or less like some buffoons. The actors do what's necessary, but not more and in most cases less. Paul Bettany (""Max"") does the better job, while Rebecca Hall (""Evelyn"") is not convincing at all. Morgan Freeman has a somewhat smaller role as ""Joseph Tagger"", but there are too many stupid moments to render his interpretation as anything else as ridiculously mediocre considering how good an actor he can be. Probably not his fault. Granted he wasn't the focus here, but nevertheless. Depp also disappoints as ""Will Caster"" going through the motions, but somehow feeling almost absent on the screen, also when in physical form. One main gripe I have is that Evelyn's behavior as an highly intelligent woman when exposed to the fate of her boyfriend is overshadowed of her alleged love for him, driving her to illogical decisions. This may be acceptable if only her love had been believable. It's not. As it is presented now the audience have to assume this is how she felt, which is never a good sign. Compare this to how the love between ""Neo"" and ""Trinity"" in ""Matrix Reloaded"" is presented and where I think you can feel and more importantly understand their love for each other in the more dramatic moments of that movie. It's more than skin deep, which is not the case in ""Transcendence"". A big disappointment in short. I wanted to give this a ""2"", but I add one point for a somewhat poetic attempt of an ending."
" Original story idea vague follow through
",0.2263,-0.9347,2017-12-01 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyed this, marking it up for originality in the day of reboots and part 5 franchise films. Not without its faults though as we follow Johnny Depp as an AI expert whose consciousness is transferred into a computer. As his awareness goes viral he becomes unstoppable, embedding every computer and electrical system on the planet.On the downside this dragged at times and all the characters felt a bit flat. Depp and his wife are meant to convey this great love, I never felt it. And with his radiation sickness/fatal poisoning he just sort of went with it, no real fear or anger. The bad guys also lacked motivation or it wasn't conveyed to the viewer, just that technology is well... bad. Actually a lot of this movie is vague.I'm also just realizing that I'm not even sure who the main character is supposed to be here. Depp is in the movie (in the flesh) for only about 15 minutes and then he disappears into the background of scenes as a computer program, making it hard to relate to him. His wife (Rebecca Hall) is so selfish, stupid and blunt that it's impossible to like her. It also isn't Paul Bettany, he's a prisoner through most of the film and when he's not, the events that are happening are more or less out of his control. Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy are just there, without anything noteworthy to add. As a whole I wouldn't say it was great movie."
" You Will Transcend
",0.0,0.9483,2017-11-18 00:00:00,7,"Most excellent entertainment allowing one to ponder and appreciate while being entertained. Mild spoiling and perhaps none but I am playing it safe. Depp pulls it off and has a good supporting staff. The premise of the movie: What we have here is break through technology that changes the way people think which changes the way they react. It is as simple as that. That's the premise. Usually, this type of change as depicted in the movie would take place lets say over billions of years. Instead, it is happening within moments and this frightens the people in the movie bringing out their fears and prejudices to the point where they kill, kidnap, maim and take action out of ignorance. What appears to be menacing might not be but how will we know if we don't take chance to find out? That's the gamble. The chance if wrong has consequences and no one knows anymore than that. The movie leads us to faith but from there we learn that faith only works if you believe. It was one of the questions before healing Jesus used to ask...""Do you believe I can heal you'? If you answered yes Lord, it was done to you as you believe. Consequently everyone in his home town who refused to change their beliefs suffered for it. How? No miracles were done for them and to them. We see this premise at work in this movie executed quite well. The ending leaves one to question if mankind is ready for the greatness it was intended to have. Of course it is but not in its current state. We are left to ponder what is and what can be. Now I ask you. What more do you want from a movie? It entertains, makes you think, explores mysteries and leaves you pondering. Well done. Have your favorite snack ready to make it even more enjoyable plus a tasty drink. Get ready to well...transcend"
" Garbage. Decent idea, but story/plot/script/dialogue, cliché action, boring throughout. Disappointment.
",-0.8126,-0.9964,2017-11-18 00:00:00,1,"OK, this movie has a decent idea, man is dying, uploads his consciousness onto a computer, then to the internet, after a couple of years and a new mega facility built, he is so advanced to the point of curing people and linking them to a collective cyborg consciousness. OK, I believe the idea is decent, but I also believe it's been done before. So, the only thing that could save this would be the acting. We'll the acting sucks. We have Johnny Depp as Will Caster, what the hell is up with that stupid mustache and little goatee? Is this a pirate movie? Beyond that, his acting is boring, his voice sucks, his dialogue is crap. He sucks in this movie. Rebecca Hall as Evelyn Caste as Will's wife is below par mediocre, dialogue sucks, unintelligent, always has a concerned look, that's it. Yeah, she loves Will, but give me a break, this did not come across well. Paul Bettany as Max Waters, best actor here, but overall mediocre, not his fault, the dialogue is trash all the way. Kate Mara as Bree, who the hell thought she was a good, or even a competent actress? That stupid blond wig – WTF! Those stupid facial expressions. Morgan Freeman as Joseph Tagger, wasted in another crappy mediocre supporting role. He should retire or only take a leading role. Enough with this nonsense. Everybody else in this film is just there to fill in the holes. So, the acting is garbage, the dialogue is boring, the story is mediocre. No suspense. No chemistry between the actors. Cliché final battle – crap. And what really got me is the zombie collective. Music is filler. Cinematography was competent. At least we didn't get quick edits – thank god. Again, idea is fine, even though it was stolen from other films. Crap no chemistry acting. Cliché battles and zombies. Are we supposed to feel for the Will and his wife because he sacrificed himself and his wife for his friend Max? Then Max finds them both dead, Will's eyes closing. Where's the drama here? This movie sucks.Please read the critic - 1,2,3 WTF!? (Watch the Film)- They give a timeline, breakdown of WTF is going on in this ""film"". It takes time to do this. I applaud their effort."
" Brazen manipulation of the worst humanity has to offer
",-0.743,-0.9886,2017-11-08 00:00:00,5,"Just as the writers involved with various Star Trek projects did, the writers of this film set out to deliberately manipulate the reaction of the audience to something ""beyond"" themselves. The writers wanted us to fear the possibility of becoming anything more than the isolated entities our minds are doomed to now remain.With Star Trek, the boogeyman was the Borg and the threat that humanity would cease to have ""individuality""; in this film, it is the ""transcendent"" AI. At least in the instance of the Borg, we were shown that they used violence and force to achieve their loftier goal, just as Communism failed because it tried to use force to achieve something noble. In this movie, there was even less reason to fear the (r)evolution, since no one who becomes part of this collective does so against their free will. Quite to the contrary, it is the ""freedom fighters"" who resort to brutal violence to achieve their purpose. Only at the very end of the movie are we given even a hint that perhaps that fear was foolish and misplaced.That hint at the end was not enough to make up for the brazen attempt to drag my wife and I down into the muck of our emotions and make us wallow in baseless fear for the second half of the movie. We weren't angry at or afraid of the transcendent AI; we are afraid of small-minded humans who lack capacity to realize that existing in utter isolation is NOT such a wonderful thing, and equally afraid of those, like the writers of this film, who would exploit the small-minded for their own benefit.This film had potential to make people think. Instead the writers pandered to what they knew would resonate and sell, and in the process did their minute part to hold humanity back from its real-life transcendence."
" A good film with awesome special effects.

When you break down the film and start to see what they were trying to do, it makes more sense, the simple study of a human relationship, and the lengths people will go to for love. The special effects are dazzling, you can see a lot of bucks went into its production. Well performed, Johnny Depp is as always spot on, Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany both perform well also. It does a good job in raising the question of human evolution, and playing on the fear people have over it. At times the script and it's delivery seem a bit clunky, very little to hate, but hard to love.Underrated 7/10"
" A well acted near-future thriller that deserved a bigger budget
",0.3612,-0.9349,2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"This is not new territory, we have seen this before, notably in 1977's 'Demon Seed', or perhaps SKYNET from the Terminator series, a scientist creates a super computer that can out think humans and, as suspected, that is ALWAYS A BAD THING.This time, the excellent Jonny Depp is the mad scientist with delusions of grandeur who, after being fatally wounded by anti-tech terrorists (a little unbelievable there...) uploads his consciousness into his spanky new AI computer.His g/f is all for it and very protective of him, and soon they are building a city of tomorrow brain-hub in the middle of the desert.The anti tech radicals track them, though, and plan to launch their attack. Luckily the CIA also finds the base, and strangely, decides to also help the rebels with their attack.Here's where the movie goes decidedly off the rails, as the low budget (consider that Terminator Salvation, which is a very similar movie, had twice the budget at 200 mil) kicks in.SO the US Military is Really Concerned that a mad scientist super computer is building a private army in the desert...And they show up with like, 5 SEAL guys and ONE cannon....A freaking cannon. Towed behind an army truck. Like bringing cannons to a commando raid was sound military strategy or anything, which it isn't.I know what your saying. If they brought in attack gunships and A- 10s, the computer would take over them through their computers, blah blah blah whatever. There are ALL KINDS of high tech solutions to this that the US Military would think of.Instead, the end battle comes off as something you'd see on Stargate SG-1. The computer can now grow artificial life and has mind controlled cyborgs that can self heal, but.... geee... why not build a 50 foot tall fighting robot? Or an army of terminator style fighting soldier robots? Or even have the plant cyborg people grow themselves some bulletproof armour????!!!!Or a giant organic fence that electrocutes anyone that gets within a mile? By this stage this living city creature is fully capable of all of these things. Instead it has unarmed townspeople lumber towards the SEALS with plant tendrils coming out of them. Cringe-worthy.And that is TOO BAD, because before this, this was actually a really good movie! I mean, it's got freakin Jonny Depp and Morgan Freeman in it! Not to mention an excellent supporting role as the CIA dude, Cillian Murphy. The visuals and special effects (other than the killer plant tendrils) are also excellent.IF they had thrown a 200 mil budget at this, and had the mad computer attacking the rebels and the US government all over the world, which it could have done, behind his g/f's back, with all sorts of crazy tricks, now THAT would have been a Super Cool movie, with the final battle looking more like something from Terminator Salvation."

His wife decides that the best thing she can do is to upload his conscience into such a computer. Miraculously, it works, but the new Will evolves too quick and requires more and more power. At the same time, a group of people try to develop a virus that can stop virtual Will's lust for knowledge before he becomes too powerful to be stopped.It's a brilliant idea which wasn't exploited to its fullest, as it had much more potential, rather than seeming superficial in some important aspects. I find it hard to believe that someone can create a colossal sum of money into one's account without the government or someone to realize this fraud and do something about it. I find it even harder to believe that this entity can rebuild a whole city with a huge laboratory underneath without somebody authorized asking any questions. His wife's attitude is also to be questioned as she does almost anything she can to support her ""husband"" without even thinking for a second what consequences her acts may have.Besides these, I have to say that it is mostly interesting, with unbelievable experiments and future science. It's impressive how an AI can evolve so fast and do such great acts in a relatively short time. Unfortunately, its simplistic finale is expected as the most of the plot and leaves a sense of superficiality which you cannot ignore. It starts very well but it isn't able to keep the good pace till the end, oscillating from interesting to boring like a sine. I am somewhat disappointed by it but that's life, you can't be right all the time."

" Great movie... rotten ending
",0.2023,-0.9677,2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie would have earned a ten except for the rotten ending. I rarely ever rate a film this high.If you are not a scifi buff & not adept with computers & technology... this movie is not for you.It is excellent, advanced high tech & high drama with excellent sets, effects & acting. It pulls you in & keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end... EXCEPT for the very last scene which was a huge let down.There are some technical holes in the story. Polonium is the radioactive substance which Russia used to kill former spy Litvenenko when he changed sides to Great Britain several years ago. It is hard to obtain since it is primarily produced in a nuclear reactor. Extremely radioactive & deadly with alpha. Not something a terrorist group could obtain as implied in this film. Only gov't access & clearances could obtain this toxic metal.You should also know that dental labs have been using Polonium in partials & other dental work. It is listed on the contents of semi precious metals used in dental materials which leach into your body. Choose precious metals instead of semi precious to avoid this. They also use palladium but it is the listed ingredient use of radioactive polonium which I am concerned about. It may be ""spent polonium"" but that isn't any better than spent uranium artillery shells used by the military & the terrible effects on the crews and life near the shells or targets. Even spent they are still toxic. They also used toxic mercury in amalgam fillings, so don't think they wouldn't use such things. Read the ingredients on your dental work and go online and search for the words; polonium & dental. Polonium is also in tobacco & other things... just so you know. It is no accident.When the key character in this film was mildly grazed by a polonium coated object, the hospital scene was a ridiculous ""do absolutely nothing to help him"" in regard to medical treatment. This was not the same situation as ingesting polonium. There are radiation treatment medications and dialysis and blood transfusions,chelation & surgical removal of the tissue around the wound & a variety of tests & scans to show the irradiated hot spots for treatments they could have used since only a day had passed. It didn't hit an artery so it was still in the entry wound, not the blood supply. So watching the doctor do absolutely nothing for the character was unacceptable. This film clearly got bad advice on polonium.Next film plot hole: for such an advance facility & power source, there was no security at all to protect the underground lab facility from intruders. Especially when cost was no object. Not to mention advance antivirus protection. Also, in any high tech setup, there are always duplex sources for backup power, trunk circuits, internet connections, hardware, cabling, fiber optics, power cabling, you name it. That entire area should have been a fortress with a million sensors & security teams & devices & intruder protections. The attackers should not have gotten that close. Site security systems & personnel were nonexistent. Especially since she owned the entire town. He would also have had access to military satellites & ground penetrating radar to watch the area & use the satellite weaponry.Why didn't he just heal her? She didn't need to be uploaded to treat her injuries. Plus, he knew what they were planning & easily could have antivirus protection to deal with it. They also showed 95% of the self healing solar panels undamaged, so the power loss didn't make sense. Those were also hardware power sources which would not be affected by a virus & not on the grid nor connected to an external software source. Very few power plants are connected to the internet so not quite as devastated as shown in the film. It would need a global EMP pulse to cause such total destruction.Also, it wasn't like Morgan Freeman to go GI Joe without talking in depth to the key character; Depp. He is usually cool headed in his reasoning. The two pro AI characters joining forces with murderous, violent terrorists to wipe out everything was a huge overreaction to solving a perceived problem without in depth analysis & finding alternate, less radical options to deal with it. That's like killing a patient to remove a splinter. Who gave them permission to destroy the entire planetary infrastructure?Not once, did anyone talk to Depp in depth about his actions & intentions. They were all assuming the worst without asking questions.Then the huge let down at the end where he could have used the self healing bodies for both. 90% of the audiences probably didn't understand the ending & final scene. I got it; but I did not like that ending for the couple. Especially since he had the capacity to do so much more. Not to forget his global access.However, it was still a great movie except for the last 2 minutes for anyone who loves scifi, technology & Computers. The newer Outer limits in the 90's had a couple episodes similar to this theme but not quite as high tech.Don't mistake my nit picking as a reason not to see this great movie, Those issues are meant for the director & screenwriter to learn from their errors. Those are only issues noticed by those of us with technology backgrounds.You will enjoy the movie as long as you are prepared in advance to dislike the last 2 minutes."
" Thought provoking and raised some intriguing questions
",-0.2023,0.9614,2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,"I had the Privilege of watching Transcendence alone on a rainy Sunday afternoon and it freaked the hell out of me. In a Good way i might add!! The raindrops on my window did little but kept my thoughts in check as the film played on, keeping me in place, raising more questions at the morality of who is controlling whom. Thought provoking for someone who grew up with science as a religion and sci-fi as his Bible. As the movie progressed in what can only be described as a build up for the big question ""What happens when one of the biggest minds gets unlimited resources and power? Does he use it for Good or for Bad?"", i had the notion biting behind my ears that the movie was in fact a peek at what could be a few decades from now.Singularity and the mere thought of it is exciting and dangerous at the same time, but the Director Mr. Wally Pfister and his Directional debut manages to pulls off what we Nerds and Geeks and all movie lovers would call a great Cinematic Experience. Thrown in with the ""Fear of the Unknown"" including the wife of our protagonist who goes back and forth in her decision to either be with him or run away. The Director manages to captivate our minds with the palpable pinch on our beliefs and ""what if's"" and that is a tough thing to do considering Sci-fi can be an elaborate scheme to achieve. Johnny Depp did an amazing take with the limited screen time and of all the Bizarre (and i mean a lot!) roles he has played ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Jack Sparrow ( Captain! he shouts from behind my Monitor!!) I'd say he managed to pull this one off in a convincing way. He managed to make us doubt all the way to till the climax as to who was in Control. Was it Will Caster? the Genius and creator of the AI? or the AI, PINN (Physically Independent Neural Network) as he answered the question ""Can you prove that you are self aware?"" with ""that's a difficult question, Can you?"" it was the same answer PINN answered the first time we were introduced to ""her"".It was in all a brilliant movie that in my opinion raised the bar on science fiction. A thought Michael Bay might consider before mercilessly blowing up our childhood memories with one pointless movie after another.But it's not about Transformers. Not this review.It's about how this 1 hour and 53 minutes movie managed to latch on to my gray brain cells with more buzz than in recent months.Watch it before Singularity becomes real. Else you'd feel left out when we start answering questions you thought never existed.It's not a Popcorn flick. It's one for the Mind."
" Another kind of MATRIX
",0.0,-0.7097,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Let me get this straightforward. A lot of buzz has been made in the recent years about the concept of ""singularity"", which may occur in 2050, where humans will merge with robots (or AI, whatever). This movie shows only a glimpse of what lies ahead. It presents the central idea in all its beauty, but I appreciate more the fact that it revealed also the downsides of all these futuristic thoughts, where an insignificant threat can ruin mankind's dreams in an instance. I don't even know how to feel about the near future, whether it would be as described in movies or as Ray Kurzweil. I just want to seize the moment and wait for things to happen, rather than wasting precious time on overthinking of ""what's next!?"". At this present moment, we are both helped and affected by technology, so why we should over-contemplate about the future when there is enough to do in the present?"
" Disappointing about the End
",-0.4939,0.8156,2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,"Before I watched it, I knew this was a mind control movie (brainwashing the mass).As the movie progressed I got excited as the ""activists"" against this Artificial Intelligence seem to be the good guys.How could I be so naive. Because in the very last 5 minutes or so the movie showed that Artificial Intelligence was actually doing a great ""job"".Wake up guys... It's a movie and AI is evil (It will be the end of our human race)."
" Wasted...
",0.0,0.9466,2017-03-07 00:00:00,4,"movie with great actors and nice SFX, which unfortunately sacrifices a really interesting ethical treatise on the creative spirit of the human mind and the associated risks for superficial kindergarten action. In a row, anxious, unbelievable characters are ready to sometimes sacrifice, sometimes spare, and then sacrifice again any number of people for their own volatile do-gooder convictions and loyalties with an annoying missionary fervor."
" Too much hate than it deserves
",-0.5719,0.9849,2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"First time writing a review. I'm not your informative critic, and I don't compare films, I take them for what they are.I feel that this movie deserves a lot more than currently given. I also understand that people with different religious beliefs, view points, expectations or people making comparisons to other films may be disappointed. The ideas were certainly realistic and had a lot of potential. The film presented the ideas relatively well with decent direction and cinematography. We were left to choose a side we believe in, instead of being ushered to a conclusive philosophy. The reason I only give it a 7/10 (i.e pretty good) is due to the fact that the plot did fall short in the developmental department. It was great, but the ideas were only briefly touched on, and with our great AI willing to sacrifice everything for love in the end, despite not showing much affection/emotion throughout the film. It certainly felt like they added the concept of 'misunderstanding' just to have a happy ending. At least from my point of view. Not to mention the lack of explanation on the deeper motives behind the supposedly villain-turn-saviors, or perhaps explain their moral standpoint on why it was okay to kill people working on different believes but not with an AI that's trying to heal the world. All it all, it was a great film, I would certainly recommend people to watch it and then decide for themselves. It does touch on a few realistic future dilemmas and the ideas that provokes thought."
