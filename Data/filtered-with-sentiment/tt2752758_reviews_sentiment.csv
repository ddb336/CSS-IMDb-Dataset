" My review is unfair because...
",-0.4767,0.2263,2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,I only watched 8 minutes of the film. I could tell straight away what kind of movie I was about to endure and life is just too short.
" It wasn't good but I respected a few things
",-0.6167,0.6318,2020-12-24 00:00:00,3,"I give this movie such a high rating because it has a few decent scenes, the acting was realistic for a found footage film, and the special effects were surprisingly flawless. I guess a pair of directors from the VHS series have some skills.It was very fun to rip apart though, especially with all of the plot holes and stupid scenes. But, the movie also blatantly rips off ""Rosemary's Baby"" but makes it less interesting or sensical. So, the rating will be low on this one."
" TIME WASTING AND BORING
",-0.6124,0.0018,2020-10-21 00:00:00,1,"The movie is really boring because it spent way too much time in the house and the unclear storyline like dragging the viewers on a long, hot dusty road and feel like watching the animated sci fi movie at the end. I think my most terrible nightmare is more interesting than it."
" Devil's Progeny
",0.0,0.5732,2020-09-07 00:00:00,6,"Devil's Due: A Rosemary's Baby clone but it has some worthy scenes. The coven are much more hands on, Allison Miller, bearer of the Devil's Progeny, develops supernatural powers causing a priest to have a stroke when he discusses the Eucharist. Anyone who gets in her way is levitated/thrown about. Not great in comparison to the original but worth watching. Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (Ready Or Not) and Tyler Gilbert (Southbound) from a script by Lindsay Devlin. On Film4. 6/10."
" A bit bloody for a comedy but we had fun
",0.6428,0.1779,2019-12-07 00:00:00,10,Devils due is a good parody of movies like rosemarys baby and paranormal activity. At least we wanted to believe in that.
" Stillborn
",0.0,-0.6675,2019-09-06 00:00:00,2,"A hybrid of a found footage and a documentary style reworking of Rosemary's Baby done on the cheap.Newlyweds Samantha (Allison Miller) and Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. One evening they are taken to a weird bar by a cab driver. They get drunk to a point they do not remember what happened that night. Samantha is taken to a room where some kind of ritual is performed on her and when they arrive home, she is pregnant even though Samantha has been taking birth control pills.Zach notices his wife behaving oddly. She starts to eat raw meat even though she is a vegetarian. She can be aggressive, she can display great strength, she thinks there is something wrong with the baby. There are strangers watching the house who have rigged the house with hidden cameras. A priest ends up being hospitalised as he starts to suddenly cough up blood during a church service that the couple attend. The priest suspects that Samantha is due to give birth to the antichrist.The film has nothing new to offer when it comes to a possessed pregnancy or the found footage genre. It has all been recycled from other horror films. Apart from a few jolts it is absurd and not that scary. Even though it is less than 90 minutes long, it feels too long."
" Don't believe people who say it's good!
",0.4926,-0.906,2019-07-21 00:00:00,2,"It starts of well , then becomes bizarre . It's shots of different scenes that are clumped together in a desperate attempt to create a movie. Pretty sad and pathetic . I've watched horror movies where I've laughed but this is the first one that I've actually kept nodding off to. It was THAT boring !
Watch at your peril if you must , but you have been warned ."
" Devil's Due should've considered having an abortion.
",0.0,-0.9522,2019-04-09 00:00:00,2,"'Rosemary's Baby' meets 'Paranormal Activity' in what is possibly the most uninspired ""found-footage"" low budget horror since, well, 'Paranormal Activity 2'. What could've been an engaging metaphor on the bodily and emotional fluctuations during pregnancy is actually a tame snooze-fest that never seemed to end. 89 minutes felt like an eternity, and my cognitive inhibition was in full swing. Summoning the Antichrist should've been way more exciting and psychologically stimulating. A newly married couple jet off to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon, where the wife gets mysteriously pregnant.As the title leaves little to one's imagination, the Devil is certainly due. Showcasing every typical horror cliché from the frickin' book. They are all here! Why does the camera glitch when something ""exciting"" happens? Devil's Due, that's why. Why does she crave raw ground beef from her local supermarché, despite being a vegetarian? Obviously because Devil's Due. Why does she kill a small group of innocent deers and then proceed to frolic with some youths who happen to be filming their random trip to the river? It can only be because Devil's Due. Why does no one turn any lights on and instead proceed to use night vision because everyone wants to flipping record everything? Devil's Due, simple. Why do they let a different doctor perform an amniocentesis if they are already suspicious of him? Devil's God damn Due. Why are all the doctors shocked to see patients in their rooms? Devil's Du...no wait, nope that's not the Devil's fault. Move along. Why does their dog bark at hidden cameras in their house for seven seconds and then never bark at them again? Devil's Due for some doggy time. Why do they stupidly proceed to enter an underground club that looks completely unauthorised and cultish? Well, that's just down to stupidity. And finally, why does the whole repeat again? Second Devil's Due (that'll be the sequel...).If anything, I think this film warns us not to trust taxis. Because holy demon babies it has nothing else going for it."
" Rosemary's baby lite version
",0.0,0.7778,2019-04-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie is good it is just slow burning movie with religious point of view and mixing between cloverfield movie with Rosemary's baby
I really enjoyed it i was watching it expecting it is rating 6 or higher , not 4.1 i would give it 9 if there is no something near the end is like saying (no body was here and you are ghost)
Anyway , give it a try."
" CHILDREN, IT IS THE LAST HOUR
",0.0,-0.5583,2019-03-03 00:00:00,2,"Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) are newlyweds who annoyingly film everything and they don't do it well. On their honeymoon to the islands, she becomes pregnant with the anti-Christ which proves to be an annoyance to her vegan lifestyle.At one point when they weren't filming themselves, they used an overhead store camera to maintain the realism. It was really nice for a change to see something without a camera jerking about or a head being cut off. What was with the kid with a camera making a film in a dark hallway?Carrying the dark lord around in your tummy makes Holy Communion a little more exciting than usual. Apparently Satan cannot be born in a normal manner and has to come into the world making a lot of noise with kitchen utensils.The film picks up at about an hour. If you managed to make it that far you qualify for one punch on your hacker card, same as watching someone else's bad home movie about their little anti-Christ.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Stupiest Film I have ever watched!
",0.0,0.2223,2019-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I hope the whole team, that have created that completely idiotic film, to change their careers and DO NOT make any films more!!!"
" Just Ok
",0.296,-0.6966,2018-07-31 00:00:00,4,There's not a lot to say about this. It is similar to Rosemary's Baby. The acting was decent but there was a lot of shaky camera footage. The plot could have been more solid. I didn't think it was all that bad but I probably won't be seeing it again.
" THE WORST HORROR MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN
",-0.8316,-0.9921,2018-07-10 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The characters are dumb (they are actually the most dumbest characters in a movie ever), the acting is bad, it's one of those movies with the characters holding and recording the movie (which was not a good idea. They shouldn't of made the characters be the ones who record), the camera was shaky the whole movie. You could never have a proper look at the setting or anything because the cameras just shook all the time. The scares were the worst because they weren't even scary.These dumb people called Zach and Samantha are on their honeymoon. They go to some random place and meet their taxi driver. The taxi driver is in some cult thing but THEY GO WITH HIM!!! HAVE THEY NOT LEARNT STRANGER DANGER YET BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY DECIDED TO GO TO SOME PARTY WITH A TAXI DRIVER THEY JUST MET. Well yeah, something bad happens so we can't blame anyone but Sam and Zach. The taxi driver does some weird cult voodoo magic thing or some spell from Harry Potter and it gets the girl pregnant.They go home, weird stuff starts happening and Sam goes crazy like absolutely CRAZY!!! Some little girl and boy who are related to Sam are playing hide and seek in Zach and Sams house (I think it's their) and one of the little kids go up and then Sam gives a 'Jump scare' which wasn't even scary and is like ""GET OUT"" because she wanted some space to carve some random Satan or cult symbol. Sam was always carving some symbol into her floor because she was a crazy demon thing. Sam was sleeping and her stomach grew because of the baby but when she woke up her stomach was back to normal. Zach and Sam saw some weird cult dude outside looking up at their window. The taxi driver cult dude was in the church and did some weird voodoo Harry Potter spell to make the Preist have a stroke.When Sam dies and has her demon baby, guess who's there!! Oh yeah it's the cult dudes here coming to take her baby. The taxi driver and his cult friends take he baby and leave. Sam dies when she's having the baby because it's a demon and the weird thing is. SHE DIDNT HAVE HER BABY AT THE HOSPITAL. She literally layed on her dirty ground and had her baby and died so those cult dudes broke in and STOLE THE BABY. I think the police arrived and saw Sams dead body and I think they though that Zach murdered Sam because he was the only one left so he has to go to the police station and talk to them about it.So now you know the story choose if you want to watch it. It's crap so I don't recommend it but after ready the story if you want to watch it, go ahead but I'm warning you, after I watched it, I knew I was never going to get the hour and a half back!"
" Found footage Rosemary's Baby clone
",0.0,-0.5399,2017-11-15 00:00:00,5,"When a newly wed young couple accept an invitation to a club from a very suspicious looking taxi driver whilst on their honeymoon they fall prey to some unclear Satanic cult & she then becomes pregnant with the Devil's child. There's a lesson to be learned! This is basically a Rosemary's Baby clone but for the modern age. Filmed in the found footage style, a sub genre that has been frankly done to death, and although I felt that it wasn't entirely necessary for this movie they did at least do a reasonable job. Acting is good & there are a few decent special effects thrown in but on the downside it is fairly slow for most part, the shaky camera work does become annoying at times & plot wise it doesn't offer much."
" waste of time and money
",-0.4215,-0.9926,2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"wasting time open ending bad cameras view , awful plot worst movie i have ever seen in my life , when you bye a horror movie it should have a nice ending but not real ending if there is a new chapter or if the horror thing in it didn't vanish in this movie it will never end we don't know why or how or what is the problem in the first place the , and the father bad place in the movie seriously killing like he cant even try to fight bad , where is the good and bad in the movie where is the two strong thing fighting each other the one man is weak and nobody helped why the sister died why he didn't feel scary when he watched what happened to his wife he didn't even try to help here or finding out whats wrong with here he just felt crazy , and the drunk can feel a bit it should be more reality thank you for using zain"
" Such potential to be good
",0.4404,-0.9062,2017-08-05 00:00:00,4,"This could've been rated higher had it not been for the lame tangent it goes off on at the beginning after its cool/interesting premise. The couple goes to a fortune teller who determines the main girl's born from death, which really freaks her out and repels her to where she continues their walk around town not being able to get it off her mind. I thought, ""Interesting. So there's something about her."" Then, they go to a club where they get drugged so that they have a seance done on them to make her have a satanic baby. All in all, the rest of the movie had very quality suspense and interesting scenes, which is why I didn't rate it lower, but why hit the audience with an initial scene in a fortune teller's office when the rest of the movie really has nothing to do with that? Once the seance happened, I thought, ""Oh, so this has nothing to do with her being born from death, which would've been a lot more interesting and cooler."" The problem turns out NOT to be ALREADY her, it BECOMES her because of the SEANCE...and really, it's actually the evil group who keeps performing it on couples. Also, during a house party, a little girl wouldn't keep prowling around a pitch-black upper floor on her own with her camera in search of someone if she wasn't able to get her to respond by calling her from the stairs. Get real."
" Lackluster found footage film
",0.0,0.8675,2017-08-02 00:00:00,3,"Devils Due (2014) is a pretty poorly done found footage horror movie. The found footage horror sub genre has grown since Paranormal Activity came out in 2009, a movie that I loved and thought was very well put together. And I thought it's sequel was good too, but this one just doesn't cut it. The plot centers around a newlywed couple and strange occurrences that take place on their honeymoon. The couple is taken to a club by a taxi driver, they have a little too much to drink, then are taken to a creepy place where a satanic ritual is performed on the wife. They return home and she finds out that she is pregnant, and from there the coupe becomes increasingly aware of what's really going on. Things happen after she gets pregnant involving the hurting of others around them that alarm them that something truly terrible is happening. The writing is very average and mediocre, nothing special at all as far as the script goes. The acting actually isn't bad from Zach and Sam, I really liked them as the leads. That's actually the only aspect of the entire movie that I liked, the leads. It wasn't scary, or really interesting at all. Nothing about this film was interesting or fulfilling in the least. And with all that considered, I give Devils Due a 3/10."
" An unnecessary and regrettable rip-off.
",-0.5106,0.8257,2017-02-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie is apparently a rip-off of the iconic ""Rosemary's Baby"". Normally, I don't have prejudices with remakes or rip-offs, but some well-honored and acclaimed films leave no room for that and, when that happens, we quickly find that the new movie is so inferior to the first one that it doesn't justify its existence. It's more or less what happens here. The plot is almost the same: Zach and Samantha are a couple on their honeymoon. However, after a party where both get drunk, Samantha feels she is raped during a satanic cult. On waking, however, they thinks this was a dream, not feeling any mistrust when she becomes pregnant. This will change over the course of her pregnancy, as Samantha takes on a strange behavior. The plot brings little new when compared to the classic film that precedes it and it's clearly inferior in quality. It all seems unrealistic, far-fetched and absurd, which is criminal in a film that had low production budget but a huge budget for advertising. The actors' performance is mediocre. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are the main actors and they certainly tried to do their best, but the truth is that the material they were given was too bad and they just ended up dropping their characters. Personally, I don't blame them, I blame the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and screenwriter, Lindsay Devlin. The film spends most of its time focused on the changes of the pregnant girl, at a deliberately slow pace that would help create suspense if we didn't predict what would happen so easily, if the ending wasn't so uninteresting and if special effects weren't so basic."
