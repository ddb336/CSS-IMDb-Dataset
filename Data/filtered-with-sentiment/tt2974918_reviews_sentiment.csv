" The only decent sequel to the Alvin and the Chipmunks movies.
",0.0,0.9616,2021-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Movie 4 is the third sequel and the final installment of the live action film series based off the novelty band franchise. While I don't remember this one as fondly as others, I still prefer it over the second and third movies respectively.What I dislike about this includes toilet humor, trying to be hip with the audience, it literally recycles songs from the previous movies, Dave's first ""ALVIN"" scream in this film was a lot weaker than the others, the jokes are still a hit or miss, there is literally a fourth wall break involving the chipmunks applying clothing from their plush counterparts from the second movie onto the squirrels, the confronting scene between the parents and the chipmunks (and Miles) is really poorly done, very predictable, some of the actors suck at acting, it relies too much on pop culture references and the musical number at the end can cause seizures.What I like about this is that it has one of the best plots since the 2007 film, it's a little more faithful to the source material than the first and second sequels, the animation has significantly improved to make the characters look more expressive, the voice acting is okay, the Chippetes are not annoying at the slightest this time due to their minimal presence, a decent villain backstory, there are plenty of callbacks to the 2007 film, great score, a great original musical number at the end of the film, the adoption scene is heartwarming, and that one last ""ALVIN"" scream is a great way to send this movie series off forever despite it being the last line Dave says in every movie.Overall, I liked this one nearly as much as the first one (which was okay to begin with), but more than the second and third movies, especially the latter. That's all I have to say. May this guilty pleasure of a movie series rest in peace."

" Rubbish no doubt, yet I can't say I hate it to be honest
",0.3814,-0.2875,2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"My first film of 2021 - I know, I know... hold back your jealousy.I've watched the preceding three films and, genuinely, enjoyed the first two, the third isn't good but isn't bad either. 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip' is easily the weakest entry, but I still find it impossible to dislike these films. They're stupid but they kinda work, at least in terms of what their intended purpose is.The casting is quite something. Jason Lee, somewhat surprisingly, returns, with new addition Bella Thorne - who appears in, like, four scenes. You also have Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Kaley Cuoco in voice roles, alongside appearances from ""Crazy Eyes"", ""Stifler's Mom"", ""savior Jared"" and ""Crabman"". Iykyk.I didn't care for any of it, the story is clich√©d, nonsensical and woefully written - and there's barely even a road trip. I do, though, like the chipmunk animation, I chuckled a few times due to how they are animated.Rubbish no doubt, yet I can't say I hate it to be honest."
" The best movie of the chipmunks
",0.6369,0.9567,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Is it silly? Yes. Is it technically good? No. But is it funny? Sure! Honestly, I think that this one has a better and cooler plot in comparision to the other three."
" This movie changed my life.
",0.0,0.9169,2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,"This is the best movie I've ever seen, no doubt. I've watched a lot of films in my time on earth, and this movie changed my entire point of view on life.
this film made me laugh. it made me cry. it made me feel joy and it made me feel sorrow, with a truly compelling storyline and amazing storytelling.
Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, has changed my life for the better."
" Chip. Ha ha
",0.5859,-0.0516,2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,I like the bit where they talk in that high pitched annoying voice
" The better squeakquel
",0.4404,0.4404,2020-07-04 00:00:00,7,The road chip is better than the first three of the movies in the series.
" At least it's pretty decent
",0.4939,0.0523,2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"As much as People think that Chipwrecked was bad, at least Road Chip is better. I don't really know what Kind of jokes they used here, but they were infact jokes.It also had a Story, no matter weird and crippled it was for some People, at least it had a Story.I Always loved Alvin and the Chipmunks. It's a Franchise I will NEVER Forget.So, this movie is not perfect, but at still worth watching. 7 out of 10."
" A bit better than the other live action Chipmunk movies
",0.4404,-0.4477,2020-04-20 00:00:00,4,"I re-watched this the other day when I caught it on the TV. While the live action Chipmunk movies aren't great, I actually thought this one was a bit better than the others (and it looks like I'm not alone in thinking that because Channel Awesome/The Nostalgia Critic seems to think that aswell despite not liking it). It actually has more of a plot to it- rather than just the chipmunks start high school, the chipettes also start high school, they enter a competition or something, Ian kidnaps them & they rescue them & that's about it (talking about The Squeakquel). I actually remember kind of enjoying it when I saw it. I'm not sure if it had a plothole- Miles tells the Chipmunks that Dave will forget about him after he marries Miles' mum but still goes with them to stop the proposal- unless he was just saying that to mess with the chipmunks? Overall, not too bad.Funny that I gave it the same rating as Chipwrecked- I couldn't decide whether to give this a 4 or 5 out of 10."
" Life-Changing
",0.0,0.96,2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,"This film was a monumental thing for me to observe. I would simply like to thank the creators for blessing my eyes and ears with such glorious pieces of art. I have been blessed and for the first time in my life I feel complete. I am forever thankful and forever in your debt. In the famous words of Ian ""There is no I in team"" but there is an I in Alvin""!! What a great line, it helps encapsulate all the atrocities of the Armenian Genocide that occurred a few decades ago"
" ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE ROAD CHIP (2015) - 21/03/2020
",0.0,0.81,2020-03-30 00:00:00,2,"If you've watched the other Alvin and the Chipmunk movies, you pretty much know what to expect here. It's geared towards kids with a paper thin plot and a cheesy story. It's on par with the other Chipmunk films I can't say it's any better or worse. But as a film it's pretty lousy. The only good thing in this film, is it's improvements in the CGI category. That's it.Mitchell Bulfin"
" Terrible. Utterly terrible.
",-0.7574,-0.9258,2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,"This film is boring, uninventive and gives off a painful to watch vibe. Suitable for 4-8, but no other age groups. Such a small minority of those who enjoy watching films, makes me give it such a painful rating. Very boring. Very bad."
" Cinematic Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.4404,2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I am lost for words really. This movie is utterly incredible. Never in cinematic history has this ever been, and will ever be topped. From the acting to the cinematography, every second had me on the edge of my seat to take in the greatest episode of the saga thus far. 10/10"
" Terrible Plot

" Good
",0.4404,0.9809,2019-11-18 00:00:00,7,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is a canada-united-states comedy movie directed by Walt Becker and written by Randi Mayem Singer and Adam Sztykiel. It was starring Jason Lee, Tony Hale, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Josh Green, Bella Thorne, Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney, Kaley Cuoco, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate. Debuted in the United States on December 18, 2015 by 20th Century Fox. In Brazil, the movie was released on December 24, 2015 by Fox Film do Brasil and in Portugal the movie was released on February 4, 2016 by Big Picture FilmsUpon returning home, Dave finds a surprise party hosted by Alvin, Simon and Theodore to greet him. Of course, the event goes out of control, generating numerous confusions. Annoyed by this, Dave warns that he will travel to Miami soon and will leave the young squirrels in the care of a neighbor. Except that, by chance, the squirrels find an engagement ring in a bag. Believing that Dave will propose to his girlfriend Samantha, Alvin and his brothers come up with a plan for the engagement not to happen, as they believe Dave can abandon them. Who will help them on this journey is Miles, Samantha's son, who also does not want them to marry.This new adventure brings nothing new, but still can make a more interesting story! The script is more of an adult than a child joke and it's fun, and the movie is the second best movie in the franchise and so my movie rating is 3.5 (good) out of 5.0.Movie seen on June 29th"
" Recommended for all ages, families and animals
",0.2023,0.9896,2019-11-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the sweetest, funniest, and to some degree educational family film ever. With the use of talking chipmunks, you learn the value of family, even the unconvential kind. And the many ways people with nothing in common learn to understand each other and love each other. It's full of hugs, tears and music. It ends with heartwarming moment after heartwarming moment. Then some comic relief of course, for good measure.My favorite part is the fact that Miles is a clearly emotional teenager. Guys showing emotion is the most beautiful thing a movie can have, and the use of it with a man in his early adult years, is even sweeter."
" Cute
",0.4588,-0.5023,2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Another classic cartoon gets a touch up. Alvin and the Chipmunks are CGI'd but they're the same old trouble makers. This time they are traversing cross country to stop Dave from proposing to his new GF. They get into all kinds of trouble, predictably, and sing their way out of some situations as well. It was cute."

It has a perfect combenation of comedy and music."

",-0.4019,-0.9671,2018-11-15 00:00:00,3,"Annoying, lazy, unfunny, boring, and it made me want the FBI agent to catch the chipmunks and kill them, then stuff them, and then burn them in hell. This movies is just BAD."

" no expections and no hopes
",-0.1531,-0.8407,2018-06-30 00:00:00,3,"Dave (Jason Lee) goes to Miami and brings along girlfriend Samantha (Kimberly Williams-Paisley). The boys are bullied by her teenage son Miles who convinces them that Dave is about to propose to Samantha in Miami. They and Miles set off to stop them. On the plane, the boys cause an emergency landing and angry Air Marshal Suggs (Tony Hale) puts them on the no-fly list. It's a road trip with avenging Suggs on their tails. Meanwhile, the Chipettes are judges on American Idol.I'm not a fan of the Chipmunks. I have no expectations and sadly, I have no hopes for this franchise. I'm glad that the Chipettes aren't in the main plot although they managed to get in the side door. They should either be fully incorporated or cut out of the movie. I really don't like Miles and that makes this movie impossible even as he starts to turn nice. The premise would work much better if the proposal is real. I don't think this is good even for little fans of the Chipmunks."
" Better then Chipwrecked
",0.4404,-0.8913,2018-04-23 00:00:00,10,Even the last movie before this one wasn't as good as the last one. But this movie makes up for all of that.At least there is a new villain instead of just Ian Hawk in this movie but I personally think had a lot of miss potential. Also we don't see the Chipettes as much as we did in the previous movies. But other then that it's good.
" I really liked the other alvin and the chipmunks movies
",0.4754,0.2468,2018-03-16 00:00:00,5,"The Movie came out in 2016 for me 2015 for others and is 1hr 32 mins long 
This Movie has Animation, Adventure and Comedy and is rated U
It's Directed by Walt Becker and created by Ross Bagdasarian 
Janice Karman, Randi Mayem Singer and Adam Sztykiel im going to quickly cover what this movie is about before I review it.
......................................................................................Its about Alvin, Simon and Theodore who come to believe that Dave is going to propose to his new girlfriend in Miami and dump them. 
They have three days to get to him and stop the proposal, 
saving themselves not only from losing Dave but possibly from gaining a terrible stepbrother. 
..........................................................................................
I give this movie 5/10I really liked the other alvin and the chipmunks movies. So I watch this one and I have to say I dont really like how this movie started, it didnt really feel like alvin and the chipmunks. It didnt feel like the old alvin and the chipmunks. And I think if they did this a few years eralyer it would of felt like Alvin and the Chipmunks and it had been 4 years stins they made Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked and they'd lost it the feel to it.The plot started off slow and didn't make sense why the chipmunks were no longer performing but soon everything made sense and the characters' mot-ives were clear.The animation of the three chipmunks was really good, but the visual effects that blend them with the real-world backdrops are mostly badThe jokes and sight gags wasn't very funny, the chipmunks aren't as entertaining as they usually are and their performances lacked creativity and energy
They some of the characters felt clich√© and dry.
I have to say I really hated Miles because he bullies and abuses the chipmunks but deep down you can see he is in pain and has issues that he needs to work on 
I was sad that ian didn't come back for this sequel. He was the best part of the previous installments. The guy replacing him as the 'villain' wasn't nearly as funny. But
my favourite scene was with the new villain in this movie who is this guy called James who is a mean air marshal and he is trying to be the best at his job and then the chipmunks comes in and basically ruin it 
I like this movie because It teaches a good lesson about family and trust and some of the sences maded me smile and I think its a good movie
but I really thought there would be more laugh out loud moments, I thought there was very few even funny scenes. 
the comedy has changed. Now the comedy is'nt very good and before it was just regular kids stuff.I see this movie trying to keep up with people my age as Alvin and the Chipmunks came out in 2007 and I was 8 at the time 
and with this movie I can see it ageing up bit. 
In this movie there is quite a lot of alcohol and clubbing screen time 
and the on-duty air marshal is offered two different drinks containing moonshine
and there are Some lyrics that are suggestive and Some flirting and jokes about who's ""hot."" 
and there is couples that embraces and kisses and some dirty dancing which is not appropriate for children 
which is rated U which means suitable for audiences aged four years and over
I did like some of the music that was used"
