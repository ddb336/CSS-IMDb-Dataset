" Don't watxch for the XCGI
",0.0,0.5257,2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"If you watch movies for plot, pacing, dialog and story? You'll like this movie. If you focus on the quality of the CGI? You won't. It's really pretty much that simple.A Tarzan story that starts from a different place than the typical Tarzan story, with Lord Greystoke having lived in London for a number of years after leaving Africa, the story is interesting and engaging. Jane doesn't need to be won, she's his wife. Tarzan returns to Africa (specifically to the Congo) for reasons to do with possible evil on the part of King Leopold.And such evil exists. So, the adventure begins.It feels like a Burroughs story. As it should."
" Finally a perfect adaption.
",0.5719,0.765,2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"I seen this upon release back in the day. Since then I've been reluctant to do a review. I'll finally make a review after I finished rewatching the animation version.This adaption is about conquering and discovery by the Romans.It has a different take from the animation or books.Tarzan in this version travels from Roman civilization to the jungle where he is respected in both places.
When Tarzan returns to the jungle its being invaded by poachers, scvangers and the so called slave trade is in progress.The movie has a full on grey feel when you watch it.
Sam jack character is really just a butler at best.The villians were evil as history says.Tarzan did a good job carrying the production.Overall a fantastic movie for that fantatic fans.What can be learned? Beware of those in ivory.Verdict: Enjoy it. For what it tried to be."
" Quite enjoyable
",0.4927,0.9981,2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Despite some minor flaws, I still found the film to be quite enjoyable. One of the flaws has to do with the editing; in one scene, within the space of a few seconds, Tarzan moved from beautiful sunshine to a dark rainy jungle. And Tarzan is swinging on a vine in between trees and over a pretty long distance. It was a little ridiculous how he managed to do that without switching to another vine. Another minor thing was all the CGI animals. They mostly looked good and some of the sequences with the humans and animals together were brilliant; but the CGI could have been better.There were many positives. The slavery element to the story provided an interesting (albeit controversial) perspective. The costume design, hair and make-up people, and all those involved in that area of the movie did a tremendous job. It was a beautifully made film. In particular I loved the look of tribe led by Chief Mbonga. They kind of resemble the Skull Island's native tribe in most 'King Kong' movies.The acting was good from the main cast. Skarsgard gets into shape for this part and despite some criticism I thought he played the part really well. Maggie Robbie was also good, in particular during her scenes with Waltz, who was himself excellent. He has a great way of playing these well spoken, well mannered, nuanced characters. Obviously Jackson is always good and without doubt he provided the best comedic line in the film.All in all, a fresh twist on the Tarzan story. The acting was really good. The CGI looked good. At the end of the day it's a fantasy adventure movie. You see these types of films for the same reason you see superhero films - the action and excitement. And it ticked most of the boxes."

" Regular
",0.0,0.09,2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"The hero's trajectory, this is Tarzan's new film, it contains all those basic clichés, the visual and animal effects are just good (nothing compared to Planet of the Apes, for example), the performances are weak, except for Samuel Jackson, the film's photography is beautiful and surprising at times, despite the excess of Cromaqui, and the scenes with out-of-context audio from flashbacks there Spike Jonzen, and the soundtrack is imperceptible, I didn't read the books, but I saw the animation from the 90s, which is much better, the film fails to explore the conflict between the Tarzan between the world that was wild and the civilized, that many times wild animals love unconditionally and without judgments because they are irrational, this is brushed up in the film but very little explored, here is my condolences to the script that disappoint. Tarzan is a movie to see with the family on any Sunday, that's all."
" Everything but certainly not a Tarzan movie... disappointing
",0.7609,-0.8511,2021-01-12 00:00:00,4,"I went to the cinema excited, standing on tiptoes to finally see a live action Tarzan movie. And I must say I was thoroughly disappointed. Throughout the movie the writer can't decide whether Tarzan is Batman, Superman, simply Tarzan or a helpless baby.
Not to mention the movie's extremely pathetic portrayal of apes who made the animated films such a classic!"
" Closer to the book version of Tarzan than the Weissmuller embarrassment.
",-0.4404,0.9549,2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"As a kid I had seen a few Tarzan movies on TV, and then when I was 11 my aunt gave me her five copies of the original Tarzan novels, Which I still have. After reading the first one, Tarzan of the apes, I could no longer watch a Johnny Weissmuller movie, they took an amazing character and turned him into just sort of special needs. Tarzan of the books never talked like JW, he spoke several languages, he never lived in a treehouse, there was no chimp name cheetah nor a kid name boy. That said, this version of the movie is very close to the Tarzan of the books. Greystoke, the legend of Tarzan is a great version of the 1st part of the story. In the books he grows up in the African jungle with apes, he becomes lord of his tribe of apes, meets Jane Porter, helps her get rescued, but he stays in Africa never having talked to her, then he saves Frenchman named Paul d'Arnot and the frenchman teaches him English and French, Tarzan helps him get out of the jungle and they make their way back to England. Tarzan, John Clayton, assumes his role as lord Greystoke. He then traveled to America to find Jane. After a few years he returns to Africa, eventually builds a ranch and him and Jane marry, have a son named Jack, and they live in Africa most of the rest of their lives, With the exception of the many adventures that take Tarzan away from his ranch. This story is similar to many of the books, with the exception of Tarzan never lets a bad guy live. And he usually has his fathers knife with him which he uses quite often. If you're a fan of the books you will love this movie, if you're a fan of that dreadful Disney cartoon or the Johnny Weissmuller movies then of course you will hate this one."
" Best Ever
",0.6369,-0.2732,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,I never take to heart what the critics say. They are the worst reviews of movies I've ever read. The legend of Tarzan happens to be one of the best ever made.
" predictable plot, no surprises
",-0.0772,-0.1013,2020-10-15 00:00:00,3,"OK, so Tarzan certainly looks cut and muscular. But the plot itself is very predictable - every time our hero is in trouble he gets out of it, and you just know the bad guys will not get away with whatever they want. Only, the solution involves a ludicrous battle involving numerous CGI animals under our hero's influence. I laughed out loud at these scenes."
" SIMPLIFY
",0.0,-0.4758,2020-09-15 00:00:00,5,"In this continuation of the story Tarzan is lured back to the Congo as a trick, so that he may die for the murder of A chiefs son. The deal. You get us Tarzan, & we'll help you enslave the entire population of the Belgian Congo.
It's a good story.
Unfortunately, the action on screen is ""unreal"", it's almost like a cartoon. When they go to swing onto the moving train? Tarzan mentions gravity. What about every other physical property known on earth. How long was that vine? & I'm pretty sure that you dont survive fights with a full grown mountain gorilla."
" A most enjoyable Romp!
",0.54,0.9628,2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Not that the modern version can ever replace the Tarzans of yesterday, but this one does pretty well except, in the opinion of this review, a weak villain who is quite obvious from the beginning. Sorry Christophe but having seen you in 2-3 films of late your performance appears to be the same....in this one, you go thru the jungle for several days, run like mad away from a huge glut of rampaging animals and yet the ""white suit"" hasnt 1 speck of dirt on it...WOW! Mr Yates, how do you do that-more than 1 suit?....Both Tarzan and Jane work well as does Samuel L Jackson in his role, the good guys with some help from the animal kingdom do work well, although with the more modern abilities of computer generation, the actors may not be required to work as hard as yesteryear. very enjoyable, especially for the younger generation I would think."

" Great modern concept flushed down the toilet
",0.6249,-0.8646,2020-08-07 00:00:00,2,"Alexander Skarsgård (Tarzan) & Margot Robbie basically ruin the movie with the most FAKE performances of all time - Smile, act stiff, and panic-whisper out the lines.Christoph Waltz & Samuel L Jackson have a couple of great lines, but otherwise they're exactly the same as in other movies. Lazy writing.Directing and screen play is on the floor, and the overall movie has a horror theme which suits no one."
" Great film!
",0.6588,0.9905,2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"The fact the meta score is only in the 40's is ridiculous...as ridiculous as the critics themselves. Pompous reviewers only focusing on the negative continually contradicting each other.Legend of Tarzan is, essentially, a story about a story. Heavy CGI certainly gives it an artificial feel, but it's a great film. Beautiful to the eye, perfectly cast and acted. Skarsgard and Robbie light up the screen with true chemistry...with excellent support roles around them. It's truly a great film and a different telling of an epic tale."
" Tarzan is a Disney animated classic, the legend of Tarzan is none of those things
",0.0,-0.6124,2020-07-18 00:00:00,5,Dull with poor cgi. Theres an exchange near the end which should have been left on the cutting room floor. Go watch the original Disney animated classic instead
" Great action adventure movie
",0.7506,0.9669,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"The Legend of Tarzan is a great action adventure movie that's thrilling and extremely enjoyable. Alexander Skarsgård is great as Tarzan, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou and Samuel L. Jackson are all great as well and Christoph Waltz is an excellent villain. David Yates direction is really good, it's well filmed and well paced. The CG is impressive but does have a few moments where it looks cheap. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is also really good."
" The legend of tarzan
",0.0,-0.9398,2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,"If you want to see a painfully unoriginal and unengaging story of paint-by-number characters getting at it in the green room for 90% of the time, go see this movie.The most deplorable thing about this movie - aside from the plot being an incoherent mess - is the way the villains are portrayed as caricatures, and the good guys as saints who can do no wrong. I don't know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the story.tl;dr lots of CG, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app."
" Great adventure film
",0.7506,0.7393,2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"I give this eight stars because my girlfriend loved it! I think she liked the animals winning over the bad guys. But I enjoyed it too. The flashbacks were a good way of putting across Tarzan's origins (though I can't imagine who doesn't know them) and the story had a cracking pace after the introductory part. Both heroes and villains were over the top but that was fine - it's basically a comic book on celluloid. The CGI was obviously CGI and that wasn't a big issue. The only sad part, if you know history, was how the Congo really suffered under King Leopold. No Tarzan to save the day."
" Belgian Baddies!
",0.0,-0.9429,2020-07-04 00:00:00,6,"How many films feature the Belgians as villains? Exactly. Still it made a change from the usual British Empire bashing storyline.
Based on a true historical situation - the Belgians under King Leopold treated the Congo natives abominably - this slice of Tarzania has our vine-swinging hunk lured back to Africa by idealistic, and unrealistic Dr Williams (Samuel L Jackson) in order to expose the atrocities being committed there. Naturally Jane tags along so that she can get kidnapped by off-the-peg baddie Rom (Christopher Walz) whose aim is to deliver Tarzan to King Mbonga (really) in exchange for diamonds to fund a mercenary army. Along the way we get a very modern enlightened view of the natives who, amazingly, all speak perfect English and, loads of cgi animals. In particular some unpleasantly aggressive gorillas. One of whom Tarzan fights but loses to for a change in order that he can continue his quest. In fact, as is the case with this type of film nowadays, the cgi is overdone and very obvious. The vine-swinging, involving distances of hundreds of metres on one vine, is quite ridiculous. As my wife pointed out, the vines hang vertically from a branch. At most you could only swing to an adjacent tree! Tarzan's confrontation with Mbonga ends in reconciliation when Williams purges his own demons from his past as a mercenary by explaining that Rom and the Belgians will enslave them all. A mass alliance of native forces and animals results, leading to the defeat of the naughty Belgians.
You do get the feeling that this movie was put together with very little effort. Elements from Tarzan's backstory are thrown in carelessly just to remind us of his origins; how he met Jane etc. Chris Walz has a two-dimensional role and his villainy seems to rely on what other movies you have seen him in. It probably looks better on the big screen and doubtlessly the franchise will continue well beyond its 100th year."
" Ahhhahhhhahhhhahhhahhh!
",0.0,0.9842,2020-07-01 00:00:00,3,"I did not really like this one, I felt that the story had been too Hollywood-ised. I know that's not a real word, but you know what I mean, too many silly jokes, usually from Samuel. L (Although it was nice to see him playing something at least slightly different for a change) and too many big explosions and bad guys, not to mention Tarzan suddenly being a superbeing just because he grew up in the jungle.
I think I prefer Christipher Lamberts Greystoke, although gritty and a lot simpler, I feel it tells the story I expect of Tarzan. Perhaps I should watch the Disney version and see how that one goes? This one just seemed to be out to make a blockbuster and actually didn't really even achieve that.
As much as I love Mr Skarsgard (He was brilliant in True Blood) I don't think he was hired for this film because he could play the part well, but more for his stature and fantastic physique, which honestly even I grew tired of as he just didn't fit for me.
There are times also, where I felt that it was more like Mowgli's return to the jungle as he spoke to the animals to get them on side and do his bidding. Perhaps I'm missing a key part of the original story by Burroughs, but it was all very geared to his success from the beginning, there was no adversity to overcome with any great struggle. And yes I know that this is a revisit, but it's ten years later, very convenient that the same animals are still living and still don't want to eat him, don't you think?Another thing that I don't like in these overly CGI'd animal films is that they never seem to get the Gorillas right, which apparently is explained away by them being a different breed known as Mangani's or something? They might as well have been the two men dressed up to advertise Barclays Fraud warnings.All just a bit meh for my tastes."
" Idiotic pile of garbage
",-0.5574,-0.6863,2020-06-28 00:00:00,3,"The most amazing & unbelievable thing about this movie is that $180 million was spent using a story so awful it could only have been written by morons.
The CGI at best was amateurish throughout the entire movie with none of the apes resembling anything close to real apes & the over the top action sequences are just awful, swinging non stop on vines at blurring speeds, idiotic cartoonish fantasy.
The mighty Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgård who looked stoned the entire time, really poor choice of actor for this role.
Very expensive exercise in how to make cinematic garbage.
This gets 3 stars simply for the addition of Margot Robbie."
" Absolutely ludicrous
",-0.4201,-0.7462,2020-06-28 00:00:00,3,"This adaptation of Tarzan is abysmal - the
coordinated multiple animal species attack at the end so ridiculous as to be untrue."
" ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is the proverbial wasted potential, but that, as a whole, still manages to be superior to much remake and reboot that Hollywood has been doing
",0.5647,0.999,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"There are characters that transcend time, being true myths or legends - and certainly Tarzan is an example of that. Tarzan was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Appearing for the first time in the pulp magazine All-Story Magazine in 1912 and published in book format in 1914. The character appeared in twenty-five more books and in several separate stories, several books authorized by other authors and innumerable works in other media, authorized and unauthorized. In this new adaptation, director David Yates - responsible for directing the last four films of the Harry Potter saga and the films of the Fantastic Animals saga - brings another version of the legend and taking full advantage of everything that the character already represents. In this version, Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) left the African jungle almost a decade ago and adopted a new home with Jane Margot Robbie) in the mansion left by his parents. He receives an invitation to return to Africa on a diplomatic mission, but does not seem very interested in returning to his homeland until he is persuaded by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) that something very wrong may be happening to the natives. In fact, it is a plan by the villain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) who intends to exchange the hero for precious stones in order to get rich, negotiating with Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), the leader of a local tribe. Tarzan sees his wife and his people threatened, John becomes Tarzan again, the man becomes a myth again.""The Legend of Tarzan"" focuses on a moment later than what is usually portrayed, the film follows the return of Lord Greystoke to his primate origins, tells the return of John Clayto III to the figure of Tarzan, a man who was civilized, who assumes his social obligations, but the call, in the form of an ambush at first, makes him a hero again, a legend again. That is how The Legend of Tarzan manages to deal with themes such as this mythical dimension of the character and the historical moment that Tarzan enters without forgetting that it is still a great adventure.Tarzan, or rather, John Clayton III goes from being the savage we saw in other film versions based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' books to becoming an arrogant aristocrat who values his routine in London more than his home on the African continent. The purpose of the film is to give another perspective to the story of a man who grew up with animals. The script of the duo Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer takes an extremely interesting path: the film is not a journey of the hero, but a return to this post. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) is portrayed as a man who wants to get rid of the legends and stories that surround him, someone who wants to be recognized for acts that can be done wearing a suit and tie. So what you see on the screen is a journey back to that condition of hero, to that dimension of legend.Director David Yates manages to perfectly combine the fantastic characteristic with this realism, the Tarzan that flies like a spirit through the forest is extremely credible in that region that lives under constant threat of a civil war fueled by European governments. In addition to being cohesive, the filmmaker demonstrates a great visual accuracy, along with a photograph by Henry Braham that films the Congo dependencies with extreme delicacy using the sun and the fog of the place to create very expressive and beautiful plans, helping to give an even greater dimension. more heroic and romantic to that journey. It is true that the filmmaker often falls into some technical and aesthetic exaggerations with the excess of slow motion and mainly a belief in the role of CGI, with effects that, by seeking an extreme realism, prove to be flawed and mainly not very interesting aesthetically. Still, The Legend of Tarzan is a film that visually is above average compared to its contemporary blockbusters.A hundred years have passed, but the script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer has not changed the representation: Tarzan is still a rich, white, British lord who goes to Africa to lead black men who cannot survive alone. In addition, he must save the eternal damsel in distress and ensure the procreation of the species. Paternalism, colonialism and machismo are some of the elements that crossed the century and remained in the new version of history. Tarzan is a character totally linked to neo-imperialism and The Legend of Tarzan does not turn a blind eye to such issues. The sharing of African territories was somewhat inhumane, uniting rival tribes and disregarding any history, the character has always been the counterpoint of this colonization. Tarzan does not return as a white man to civilize, but as the native figure who returns to lead and unify the same people against the figure of an invader who does not bring a peace mission, but seeks an endless exploration. Alexander Skarsgård's interpretation brings the primordial Tarzan just at a glance, as the story begins with the character - John Clayton III, played by Skarsgård - completely assimilated to civilization, married to Jane (Margot Robbie) in England and being drawn back to England. Africa. Tarzan's civilizing streak is never lost, but the actor, on the other hand, can never really convince about his character's wild nature, especially because of his extreme, shaky and unnecessary close-ups when younger in the jungle, in addition to the mistaken use of rejuvenating CGI. He is in an uncomfortable middle ground between what he was and what he is, without ever really embracing one state or another.Jane (Margot Robbie) in this film is presented as a character who, like Tarzan, grew up in that region; while he was raised by gorillas in the middle of the forest, she lived in the middle of a native tribe while her father was teaching at the sites. Even though she is just a damsel in distress for much of the film, Robbie has charisma and beauty that impress, and also manages to bring a certain amount of empowerment to the character. Another one who brings this awareness of exploration is Willams (Samuel L. Jackson), an American who participated in the bloody expansion to the West in North America and who seeks to help Tarzan's mission his own redemption. At the same time, it works as a displaced and completely unnecessary comic relief.With comings and goings to the past by means of flashbacks that do not help in the fluidity of the narrative, but that undoubtedly add important information to it, The Legend of Tarzan is the proverbial wasted potential, but that, as a whole, still manages to be superior to much remake and reboot that Hollywood has been doing. The visual effects of the feature, which is based only on that, are also not impressive. Gorillas, bison and even the forest in the background do not show veracity, making the look, which should be the main point due to the immersion of the feature in the jungle, little credible. They fulfill their role in moments of contemplation, but seem artificial when the rush takes over history - see the train scene and the run on the vines. Unlike ""Mogli or ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""The Legend of Tarzan"" cannot integrate digital nature with human characters without a strangeness effect. By wanting to show off too much, the technology ends up drawing attention to itself, sounding artificial.The montage of the scenes also leaves something to be desired, failing to create a coherent and fluid story. In this age of fast images and cult of spectacle, the film strives to create frantic twists, even when they don't serve the narrative much, while director David Yates uses slow motion cameras to supposedly prolong the effect of the conflict. This makes sense in a contemporary film, but aesthetically speaking, it does not create any particularly memorable scene: the set brings the minimum that is expected of a project of this proportion.""The Legend of Tarzan"" does not lie to the viewer. Fans of the iconic character will find everything expected from the story: swings between the trees in the forest, the powerful scream from the jungle, the passion for Jane, a wicked villain who despises nature; moments of danger and redemption, speeches about humanism and ecology. For a large production, the film does not disappoint expectations either. David Yates' work is, above all, a great adventure, perhaps one of the best of the year, with a pleasant tone throughout the work that balances its realism. At a certain moment, Tarzan and his companions need to get on a moving train, the heroes jump from a huge tree, flying through the vines and carrying out an assault that resembles the best of the wild West, an essential reference for any self-respecting adventure."

Tarzan is played quite well by the lead - in fact the whole cast does a decent job. The CGI is kinda corny but it isn't so bad the movie is unwatchable. The themes of the film are kinda strange - I think I prefer the Tarzan Legend of Greystoke type film where Tarzan leaves the jungle and goes into the real world. But whatever. This film is just a run of the mill Hollywood movie that is well made but bad.

The villain is some kind of, I don't know, missionary? (??). Samuel L. Jackson is pretty much wasted, and the scene where he whines about ""what we did to those Indians"" is now fused in my brain forever. The plot was pedantic and the action scenes were generic. David Yates, the director, obviously fancies himself as the new Peter Jackson, (turning to ape stories after his fantasy franchise ended), but he doesn't have the epic yet idiosyncratic style of Jackson. He's the direct to video version. Watch Jackson's King Kong instead."

Outstanding adaptation of burroughs original feel of the novels mixed with fascinating historical background and perfect sense of adventure. What does well does extraordinary well, it does not exagerate with unecessary super hero feel, the characters are excellent and the actual story structure is the perfect sum up of the original books feel.
I didnt even knew this movie existed until a week ago when i bought the 3d bluray and its one of the best adventure movies ive seen in a lot of years.

He looks nothing like Tarzan.
He's just been cast because he was a popular among the girls at the time the movies was made.
Like if the producer wanted to make Tarzan popular amongst girls.
But Tarzan has allways been a man the boys looked op to. Someone the boys wanted to be. Just like James Bond or Superman ect.There have been severel actors who had the right face to portray Tarzan:
Frank Merrill, Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker, Miles O'keefe ect.
Since the early 80' there seems to be a kind of idea that Tarzan should look like a young poprock star!
But thats not how Tarzan looks.
Tarzan is a full grown man, not a young popstar. If you wanna know how Tarzan has to look in the movies, then look at the comics by Bourne Hogarth and Russ Manning.
Skarsgaard looks nothing like that."

" My Review!
",0.0,-0.1907,2019-08-29 00:00:00,7,"I wished this movie wasn't about his Legend. It focussed so much on John Greystoke that ""The Legend"" just dropped here and there. No doubt this is a new take on Tarzan's story, but something was just missing. I wished it was more like The Jungle Book. Focussing more on the main character. This would've brought back tons of nostalgic moments. For the fans of Tarzan, do watch. :)Peace Out!"
" Surprisingly watchable
",0.296,0.9782,2019-07-28 00:00:00,8,"I began watching this movie with the thought that I could always stop and hit ""delete"" if it was as awful as it had been described by some. However, while not the best, deepest or most satisfying movie I've ever seen, it was a long, long way from the complete dud I'd expected reading the reviews here. Margot Robbie's Jane was spirited and intelligent, Samuel L Jackson was - well, Samuel L Jackson; that is to say, sardonic, slightly cynical but in the end loyal and decent, with a good dose of humour thrown in. And Skarsgard as Tarzan/John Clayton depicted well enough the man of two opposing cultures, using all the weapons of both in an attempt to save the country he ultimately accepts as being his true home, along with his wife (and if nothing else, looking pretty damn good in the process). And the Tarzan roar is fairly impressive too! Romance, intrigue, action - Shakespeare it may not be, but a pleasant enough way to pass 2 hours all the same."
" Definitely not a Disney classic.
",0.4019,0.985,2019-07-19 00:00:00,6,"Here's my review of "" the legend of Tarzan "" .If you're a fan of the Disney 2d movie you might not accept alexander skarsgard as Tarzan ,and remember there are no talking apes or red elephants in this movie ,and the story does not suit the title as this is not his origin but the events which occur after he goes to London with Jane and becomes "" civilised "" , this movie also has mind blowing CGI and a great music score even though it did not stand equal to its 2d predecessor ,the actions sequences are well choreographed with no shaky cam followed by a great cast and screenplay. The best thing about this movie is Samuel l Jackson as George Williams and you'd be surprised to hear is middle name by the end of the movie and I was surprised to see Margot Robbie as jane ,cuz all the roles she's done earlier are completely different and sucide squad is a complete game changer for her career.however David yates need to make his movies a bit brighter and that's the problem with his harry potter movies.so in the end LOT is a great movie for all the fans and an even better experience for people who haven't heard of the jungle lord.and BTW George of the jungle and Tarzan are not related."

" One Slippery Vine Too Many !
",0.0,0.9972,2019-06-20 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure there was ever really a Tarzan-like call to reboot the fictional jungle character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. But in a film-making era dominated by productions centred around super heroes and other like comic book characters, I guess it's understandable that thought be given to resurrecting the original pulp wilderness daredevil. With a $180 million budget and the combined talents of a skilled experienced cast and veteran Harry Potter franchise director David Yates running the show, you'd be forgiven for having expectations, that The Legend of Tarzan would turn out to be more successful and attractive than it proves to be.There's the feeling that attempts were made to update a (normally) 19th century white male hero with an aura of 21st century cultural values with this production, but ultimately commercial ambitions seem to have decreed that contrivance and derivative regulation should rule supreme. So once again, we have Christoph Waltz as Captain Léon Rom doing his corrupt, merciless, but notably intelligent and polite villain gig. It's ironic that Quentin Tarantino brought the urbane Waltz to the attention of the cinema world in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds with his unforgettably sinister portrayal of SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa. But since then, seemingly only Tarantino, casting Waltz as white knight German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained has ever appeared to really try to shine a different character light on the actor. Similarly Samuel L Jackson revisits his Mace Windu/ Nick Fury ""important sidekick"" persona, when interpreting a version of George Washington Williams, a true historical figure, but here a gun-toting secret agent of the US government. Margot Robbins is radiant and arguably the movie's best asset as a plucky, courageous Jane, but when all is said and done, still just plays a damsel in distress for 75% of the running time. The best that can be said of Alexander Skarsgard is that he looks the part. We know he's a fine actor from his earlier film and TV work, but here, he delivers a king of the jungle who is just emotionless and wooden. Perhaps he became psyched out by Yates's overuse and indulgence of CGI technology. After all the sight of Tarzan's carefree swinging through trees with his gorilla pals and leading an enormous Jurassic Park like animal cavalry charge on a river town does seem pretty silly, rather than exciting.This brings me to the TLOT's greatest weakness; the storyline. When it's not being burdened with a succession of flashbacks attempting to sketch a too brief, trailer-like origin tale, we just get a narrative where logic and common sense do not prevail over forward movement of the story. A few stand outs from the many examples in the movie, not already mentioned above, should suffice to make my point.Tarzan's adopted African village and its inhabitants are visibly threatened by a band of mercenaries. But where's our hero to help out? Well, he comes on the scene too late to do a lot, because apparently he and Jane slept in and weren't woken up by the various screams and shouts of their desperate friends.Jane and a friend dive off the baddies' steam boat, in the process, escaping the seeking jaws of some willing CGI hippos whilst swimming to shore and running through the near impenetrable jungle ... where they astoundingly proceed to once again meet up with the bad guys, who have somehow contrived to dock their large boat and telepathically exactly know where the 2 escapees were running to, in this same impenetrable jungle. See, it was time that Jane needed to exhibit some independent derring do, but her character was still required as a damsel in distress and had to be recaptured by the enemy.The ever-athletic Tarzan needs to chase the bad guys on foot across various scenic facets of the African landscape. He understandably tells Williams that he won't be able to keep up with him. and needs to stay with ""the others"". Williams says he'll be able to keep up and ... unnaturally does. With the spirit and fortitude of a marathon runner (hilariously sometimes carrying his various weapons, sometimes without,) he does ... without explanation. He even jumps off cliffs and nimbly lands on the boughs of trees, wearing riding boots no less, because the story calls for him to be Tarzan's sidekick.Ultimately despite its huge budget and opulent look, The Legend of Tarzan will not light a fuse igniting a new franchise. It's too solemn, too dull, too ridiculous and too-filled with a sense of its own self importance. The original jungle wild man ends up looking decidedly tame."

Gorillas get a bad rap, yet again, and for that reason this movie will eventually be superseded by another interpretation that doesn't do that. It wasn't necessary. The excellent cgi could have been devoted to more dangers from big cats or hyenas for example. I loved the warriors for Africa in this, which dovetailed with brilliant locations and effective framing, and great action scenes. There are some brilliant ideas here, much in the same way that the recent Disney Jungle Book was a brilliant adaption. The elephants play almost the same role. Attention has been given so as to not knock the audience too far off the believability shelf, and the Tarzan character is probably the best one since Ron Ely. There was room for Jai, alas, we have to make do with Jane. Rollicking adventure with plenty of wildlife, a punchy script and a classic gentleman baddie."

" Another mindless summer movie with nothing new to offer.
",-0.4404,-0.7003,2019-03-08 00:00:00,4,"After watching The Legend of Tarzan®, the one unanswered question I had was, ""Why was this film even made?"" If this was to cash in on the plethora of live-action reinterpretations of Disney animated films, it might have held closer to that story. If this was to make a point about racism, it was making the wrong point. If this was because it's a recognizable name with a hunky-looking protagonist, then I think they probably hit the mark.While the scenery is certainly immersive in this adaptation of an Edgar Rice Burroughs character, much of this film pulled me out of the illusion of the African jungle. Right off the bat, the ""registered trademark"" that appears after in the title reminds you that there is already plenty of media about Tarzan, and another movie probably doesn't add to it. Secondly, while a star-studded cast is a good way to get audiences into the theater, the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Christoph Waltz, and Margo Robbie didn't seem to be portraying their characters as much as they were just themselves in period-accurate clothing. Finally, the CGI of the animals fell into the ""uncanny valley"" for me, none of them seeming realistic or even interacting with the characters at all.Since this was not an ""origin story"" film, the flashbacks to fill in the backstory, being disjointed in nature, felt like they took away from the flow of the plot. That's not to mention that the plot (and any of its sub-plots) felt contrived and cliché. Furthermore, in a day and age filled with racial tension and strife, having a white man come in and save the day while at the same time physically beating up on Africans felt a little bit too culturally insensitive to not say anything about it.Another mindless summer movie with nothing new to offer, I give The Legend of Tarzan® 2.0 stars out of 5."

" A nice movie...
",0.4215,0.9974,2018-12-04 00:00:00,6,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch the story of Tarzan, a person who was raised by apes when his parents died in Africa. After some years left Africa and returned to his parents' home in England with the woman he fell in love with and married. When he is asked by Belgian King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the country and refuses to go an American wants him to accept the king's proposal so he can accompany him because he informs Tarzan that Leopold might be committing many crimes like slavery in order to achieve his goal.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which was simple but very interesting. The movie had very good visual effects and also descent CGI for that kind of movie. The direction which was made by David Yates was very good and I liked the way he presented the story of Tarzan and how he presented all the events of his life. I also liked the interpretations of Alexander Skarsgård who played as John Clayton / Tarzan and he was simply amazing and Margot Robbie who played as Jane Clayton and she was also very good at it. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Samuel L. Jackson's who played as George Washington Williams and Christoph Waltz's who played as Leon Rom.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a very good movie to watch because it combines very well the action scenes with romance and the presentation of the life of Tarzan from the present to the past and again to the present was very interesting. I recommend everyone to watch it because of all the previous reasons that I wrote and because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much."

",0.5667,0.986,2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,"What I liked about the movie was the way it incorporated flashbacks of Tarzan's origin based on the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs. I don't know if it was all true to form, but the basics seemed to be there. As a kid, I tried to catch as many of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan flicks I could because I loved wild animals and couldn't get enough of pictures featuring lions, elephants, gorillas and what-not. I can only imagine how thrilled I might have been to have seen this picture back around the late Fifties or so, CGI inspired or not. Back then it was men in gorilla suits, so the criticisms I read about the brutes in this film, though warranted, still doesn't diminish the thrill of watching Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) take on his 'brother' Akut, or having all those jungle animals turn out for the final showdown against the bad guys. That's another thing, in a 1930's Tarzan flick, the villains might have been Nazis, while here they were merely interested in that old standby, the profit motive. Notwithstanding the liberal use of CGI and the impossible Spider-Man like ability of Tarzan to wend his way through the African Congo, I did have a good time with this picture, updated as it was for a modern day action crowd. As I often am, I was surprised to see Samuel L. Jackson show up in yet another picture, seems like he's in just about everything these days. I do have to admit that Margot Robbie looked a little bit out of place in this picture, perhaps a mite too elegant and glamorous for the role as Tarzan's Jane, even if right at home in the London scenes. As usual, Christopher Waltz makes for a convincing villain, even if he isn't portraying a Nazi."

It's tiresome to see all those superheroes kicked and thrown many meters away and immediately not having the tiniest scratch or broken finger, or getting shot with fire weapons (in the shoulder of course, as if it's a small thing and enough if no vital organs were wounded) and then using that arm in fight and winning. No one gets dirty or sweaty, no one stumbles, the huge jumps are simply unreal, and they all have clean hair all the time. Am I picking on unimportant things? No, because the script was silly enough already, and the greats are so also in small things."

" Typical Action/Adventure Stuff Using The Tarzan Legend As Its Basis
",0.0,0.828,2018-08-30 00:00:00,4,"Too often, the ""stars"" of ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" become the CGI generated animals - which was unfortunate, because I thought the CGI effects were uneven and I was never even for a moment led to think that any of the various apes we were seeing were real. Mind you, I suppose the alternative would have been men in ape suits, so the use of the CGI is understandable. It's just that it wasn't very well done but it effectively took over the movie at times. Aside from that, this is essentially little more than a typical action/adventure movie using the Tarzan legend as its basis. The basics of that legend (as written by Edgar Rice Burroughs) are offered via flashbacks scattered throughout. That made the movie a bit choppy to be honest, and for the most part the flashbacks weren't necessary - although the one is which we discover the fate of Tarzan's ape ""mother"" did finally explain why Chief Mbongo was so fixated on capturing Tarzan.As the story opens, Lord Greystoke (Tarzan) is comfortably settled in England as a member of the House of Lords. But the story revolves around the desire of King Leopold of Belgium to rape the Congo of its diamonds and to enslave its people to build the necessary railroad, with Greystoke being sent by the British government to investigate things, accompanied by Jane and an American envoy. Leopold and Belgium were represented by the character of Leon Rom, who had some ambitions of his own that he wanted to fulfil, and the British are shown to be involved in this exercise of colonial privilege as well. There's nothing incredibly special about the story. It is just typical action/adventure, revolving around unbelievable special effects. But you know that there's a confrontation coming between Rom and Tarzan, and you stick with this (even if it is a bit ho-hum) to watch when they finally meet.The performances weren't anything to write home about although Christoph Waltz, I thought, was pretty good as Rom. Rom was a complex character, and Waltz managed to portray him as both menacing and at times charming. Otherwise, Alexander Skarsgard as Greystoke/Tarzan, Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as the American Dr. Williams were all right. Skarsgard and Robbie really had surprisingly few scenes together, so didn't really seem to develop much chemistry.This was really nothing special.

" A bland CGI adventure
",0.3182,-0.3129,2018-08-19 00:00:00,3,"THE LEGEND OF TARZAN is the latest big-screen outing for Edgar Rice Burroughs's famous ape-man, and thankfully not another lame 'origin' tale but rather a film that feels like one of the many sequels that Burroughs wrote. Sadly, my hopes for this film's success evaporated when I saw that David Yates, the ultra-generic director of the worst HARRY POTTER films, was at the helm. Unsurprsingly this turns out to be yet another bland CGI adventure movie, aimed at kids and without a single bone of wit or originality in its head. Alexander Skarsgard plays the usual strongman, glowering without any charisma, while solid character actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are wasted in cliched roles (comedy sidekick and villain, respectively). The less said about Margot Robbie's zero-emotion Jane the better. The film seems to have been written by idiots with no idea of Victorian or Edwardian dialogue (at one point Jane exclaims ""oh my God!"" like a Californian high schooler) but the worst thing by far are the cartoonish CGI animals. The gorillas are a distraction, the ostriches are lamentable, the endless CGI action scenes laughable (even swinging vine Tarzan is CGI). What a pity; give me a good old-fashioned Weissmuller or Scott movie any day over this trash."

" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,0.9583,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The first live-action Tarzan movie to hit cinemas since Christopher Lambert played our boy in Greystoke, The Legend Of Tarzan has its moments but, overall, doesn't quite hit the mark.John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, has been retired from Tarzanning for the best part of a decade, living with wife Jane in a stately heap and attending the House Of Lords, when American busybody George Washington Williams (a real-life person, or so I read) persuades him to return in order to scope out improvements King Leopold of Belgium has made in the Congo. Meanwhile, baddie Leon Rom is seeking to obtain massive diamonds for nearly bankrupt Belgium from Opar: Chief Mbonga demands Tarzan be given to him as the price.I have read a number of Burroughs Tarzan novels, and I have probably seen the majority of the many, many Tarzan movies over the years, and I have always felt a little saddened that none of the screen versions has really captured the noble savage portrayed in the novels. Sadly, that shortcoming has not been addressed here.Like Greystoke (Hugh Hudson, 1984), it addresses Tarzan's origin, but it does so by intercutting it with the main narrative without any device to say ""this is current, this is flashback"", so you often aren't sure that you are actually watching a flashback until it's over.The story itself is simple, albeit there is arguably a bit too much of it (the Belgium connection adds an unnecessary political complication: ""Ooh, I know, let's bring Belgium into the plot!"" is an odd notion to get greenlit at a story conference), and its presentation is somewhat jumbled.Of the four principals, Alexander Skarsgard looks great but doesn't really sell Tarzan as a character, Christoph Waltz is Blofeld, Samuel L Jackson is completely 21st century, and Margot Robbie is a joyful, sexy, feisty Jane.The action is great, particularly the finale, but there is a great deal of dullness to sit through before we get to it.And, worst of all, much of the film is - as is the fashion - very dark, and all of it is presented - as is also the fashion - in washed out colours - the England scenes are all dark grey, the African scenes are either ochre (out on the veldt) or dark muddy khaki (in the jungle). 3D makes it even dimmer, to the extent that there are times when you actually can't see what's going on. Why cook up eye-boggling visuals, and then prevent your audience from seeing them?There are undoubtedly worthwhile elements here but, as a long-time Tarzan fan (Books, comics, movies, TV), I have to record disappointment at this film. It could have been a lot better."

Because all the joy is sucked out, it just becomes this lifeless Hollywood husk that doesn't do away with the silly stuff but masks it in all this over-serious schlock - including a substance-less slavery plot, the inclusion of which is an attempt to add some phoney importance to what should undoubtedly be a 'popcorn flick' - in what seems to be an effort to simply ruin your day. On top of all that, the vine-swinging action you'd expect is largely absent or neutered, save for a few full-blown seconds just before the end-credits, and the majority of the other fights are poorly shot and choppily edited while also relying far too heavily on CGI to be at all tangible.

Jackson was the antagonist, the one who betrayed Jane's father in the animated movie. It turned out he's a good one. So, I got confused. The plot was a little hard to understand, for me. At least the cinematography is amazing. I really love it. The view is superb. The romance is pretty good, too. I can feel the chemistry between Tarzan and Jane."
" ""Why is it people don't ride zebras?""
",0.0,-0.9874,2017-12-26 00:00:00,4,"Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) is convinced to return to Africa so he might help the Congolese people facing enslavement and other atrocities at the hands of Belgian diamond miners. Tarzan is accompanied by George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) and, against his wishes, his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). Soon after their arrival in Africa, Jane is kidnapped by a man named Rom (Christoph Waltz). Rom has a plan to turn Tarzan over to an African chief, Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who wants to see Tarzan punished for the death of his son. Rom intends to use Jane as bait to lure Tarzan into Mbonga's hands for a fortune in diamonds in return. As you'd expect, Tarzan sets out to rescue Jane.My little, poorly written plot summary for The Legend of Tarzan actually makes the film sound better than it is. The plot here is paper thin. A lot of what goes on makes no sense at all and characters generally behave in an irrational fashion with little motivation. All are 2D characters without much depth. The showdown between Tarzan and Mbonga should have been a highlight. Instead, it's one of weakest sequences in the film. It's over before it begins. It's frustrating to watch a film that could and should have been much better had anyone spent more time developing a solid and compelling story.Beyond my issues with the plot, I wasn't crazy about the film's structure. Parts of the story are told in a series of increasingly frustrating flashbacks. Most of the flashbacks relate to Tarzan's origin story - something that felt unnecessary to include in this movie. Not only are the flashbacks annoying but they do a pretty poor job of explaining a backstory we're all familiar with. They only serve to bloat the film and unnecessarily increase the runtime.The acting is all over the place. Skarsgård makes for a weak Tarzan. Oddly, he seems uninterested throughout most of the movie. Robbie really doesn't have much to do and is wasted. Jackson does what he usually does - he plays Williams just like every other character he plays. He seems horribly miscast to me. Hounsou and Waltz are the acting highlights for me. With more developed characters and better defined motivations, they're performances would have been even better.Even though I've already listed a number of negatives, the biggest weakness in The Legend of Tarzan is the overuse of some really bad looking CGI. Most of the animals look terrible. The gorillas, lions, wildebeests (especially the wildebeests) - none of them look convincing. There's not a ""real"" looking animal to be found in the entire movie. But the worst example of poor CGI can be seen in Tarzan's swing through the trees. A hand drawn cartoon would have looked more realistic. It's some of the worst CGI I've seen. And speaking of Tarzan swinging through the trees - the whole notion is ridiculous. Tarzan goes from one conveniently placed vine to the next at a speed that would have made a cheetah envious. It's insulting. Despite everything I've written, it's obvious from my rating that I didn't find the entire film a total flop. There are moments here and there that work - Rom's diner scene with Jane being one example. So even though I've spent several paragraphs discussing the issues I had with The Legend of Tarzan, I'm still rating the film a 4/10."

I've been a fan of Tarzan since childhood - I grew up on the Johnny Weismuller movies and I read the books. I'm a definite fan and harsh critic of bad Tarzan movies. That being said, there are a few things you expect of a Tarzan movie: swinging through the trees, hanging/fighting great apes, swimming, romancing/rescuing Jane. This movie hit those points and did a great job. To add to that, it was the closest to Burroughs accurate of any of them. There may have been some cheesy dialogue and a one dimensional bad guy, but there was also a bad guy who could see reason and IT'S A FREAKING TARZAN MOVIE!! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO ANSWER ANY BURNING QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S A FREAKING TARZAN MOVIE!! I hope they do a sequel."

I was also skeptical of Samuel L. Jackson because of some of his previous movies but thought he did good as well. Also Djimon Hounsoudid a great job as usual. The CGI was so much better in this versus The Jungle Book. I loved the twist in the story too. Good show for the family with the exception of one conversation with Tarzan and Samuel L Jackson's character.

I wish Yates would have just focused on the elements of Tarzan's story that made it so interesting in the first place instead of foolhardily trying to modernize it.

",0.0,-0.7329,2017-10-21 00:00:00,3,"When they were building up Alexander Skarsgard's six pack for this film, director David Yates should have spent some time building him a personality, too. Skarsgard's Tarzan is a blankfaced, lank haired cypher--who loses most of his fights. Sadly, Skarsgard's dreary personality matches the film's. It's a long, slow exercise in tedium. The CGI vine swinging is nearly as cartoonish as the Spider Man movies. Christopher Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson drop in their usual, never-changing, tiresome schtick. Jackson, in particular, needs to go back to acting school to work on his craft. Margot Robbie is particularly mistreated. One of the most beautiful and stylish actresses currently working,Robbie is saddled with a generic American accent and spends most of the film damp and bedraggled. While not the travesty that Bo Derek's Tarzan the Ape Man was, it's still a waste of time."
" Tarzan is still as LEGEND!!
",0.0,0.9888,2017-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Tarzan has always been a LEGEND!!!!! And he will continue to be a legend. Following on the heels of the Jungle Book remake and throwing its release-date lot in with Spielberg's BFG, this revisit to an equally beloved childhood character is in good company when it comes to the more serious end of the family movie genre. While animated flicks and new creations can rely on slapstick setups, 'hilarious' side-kick characters, modern-song medleys and loud, loud, loud colours, movies like these tend to carefully present old favourites in a more subtle package. The Legend of Tarzan, at its best, does exactly this – presenting a Sunday matinée movie full of good acting, a simple story, and blended CGIwith a calmness that comes with not having your senses assaulted by lurid colour and noise. The Legend of Tarzan is a solid ode to a character that continues to draw the imagination of children and filmmakers alike. Overall a perfectly fine family movie that trundles along at an even pace, and offers an oasis of calm in the barrage of over-hyped kids' movies making the summer circuit. The CGI used in the film is unbelievable I mean at times I totally forgot that it was CGI (Computer Generated Imagery)it was well and truly used to its full potential in this film. Furthermore, the aesthetics of it were amazing, there were not any blinding scenes or dull scenes that made it difficult for the audience to watch. In addition, they really stepped up their game with this as it was a valiant film through and through. I have already seen the film three times and I would confidently recommend this to anyone.

" I was hoping, but...
",0.4215,0.983,2017-08-21 00:00:00,4,"Disappointed. The story was random, scattered. I waited, glassy-eyed, for something to develop in the plot to catch my interest, but instead, it moves on to another scene that goes nowhere. It's a shame really. I can tell that Skarsgaard and Waltz are excellent actors who could have showcased their talents with better material. I tried not to be bored, but failed at every attempt. It wasn't for lack of trying. I tried to enjoy the film, but the totality of the story was flat - no peaks, no valleys - a flat-line, though Skarsgaard and Waltz were excellent cast- mates. I can't fault them; however, Margot Robbie did not fit. First of all, she needs elocution lessons. I couldn't understand a word she said, though I could understand the ESL Swedish and German actors quite well. She must be an exponent of the Brando school. There was plenty of overt social justice politics in it to destroy the movie as well. I give it a four because it's hard for me to give a movie less than that and seem fair.

This is something entirely different, and far inferior to the original. It was an absolute waste of my life. I'll start from the least bad thing, and work my way to the worst aspect of this film. Don't worry, there's no spoilers.First, the acting is terrible. It's like Yates just told them what to do and say right before they rolled the camera. You don't really feel like the characters are real.Second, the writing is atrocious. They go from language and dialect of the era, to SLJ saying some slang from this day and age. Like, come on, dude. Be better.Third, they obviously didn't do much research into the accuracy of certain weaponry they used in the film that originated from the time era, you'll see what I mean when you watch the climax of the film.Fourth, and worst of all,...the animation and special effects are ATROCIOUS. It's cringeworthy to watch the animals in the film, they're so obviously fake. How this film had such a huge budget, I will never understand. It was not money well spent.In conclusion...don't watch this trash. Watch the original Disney version...so much better."

Also, why are all African natives hiding in caves and dressed in war paint, and why do they all get really really close and talk really really slow and intellectual to someone? Are they really known to do this? Anyway, at the end there is a chase scene of about a gazillion million Rhinos crashing through the madman's village and destroying anything in sight, and it's like, who programming this crap? It is so fake that I was laughing. I didn't realize that Tarzan was capable of calling a crash of Rhinos on command. Cuz it's not like they're not busy hunting or something......

The story is a bit all over the place and the comic relief is a bit too common, but not a bad movie all in all. Don't expect the epic long awaited Tarzan movie. Waltz, the best bad guy since Oldman, is once again massively restrained (Spectre) but, delivers a decent performance. To be honest my biggest issue was with the mid action editing, one minute the boats afloat, the next its half sunk, etc etc. Jackson is quality as we've come to expect, with Skarsgard and Robbie looking and sounding the part. It's hard to put your finger on it be honest. You won't feel bad for watching, just don't make it your big Friday/Saturday night movie and you'll be just fine."
" Modernized means stupefied and simplified
",0.0,-0.996,2017-06-30 00:00:00,5,The movie was an 2 hours long and with a awful plot and crappy CGI. At no point in this movie did you feel attached to the actors and would not have cared if they died or not. The plot was shallow and predictable. Several scenes had no relevance to the plot and should be excluded such as the butterfly scene. Some scenes should have been longer so you would learn the characters but that didn't happen and you end up following a plot with no character development and mediocre entertainment and a lot of irritation by the plot and badly performed scenes. Tarzan or is it Captain America i'm still not sure because Tarzan defiantly has some over-natural powers since he can stand after being beaten by a 300kg giant ape monster!! Samual L. Jackson is the worst actor throughout the movie. He doesn't fit in and does no effort in adapting. He acts as if this was a Tarantino movie. Not to mention how a black man from the U.S could become a diplomat!?The apes are not realistically made at all and you do at no time feel they're scary but only extremely aggressive. I think the way Jane acted in this movie showed how pathetic the movie is and if i haven't told you yet Jane is American!! not even English as she should have been! The way she acts when she finds Tarzan is highly unrealistic unless she is very promiscuous because normally you would flee and by NO WAY LET A STRANGER TOUCH YOU!!I felt the many unrealistic scenes and the absolute lack of realism. I will never see this movie again and i can't recommend it.
" This isn't the Tarzan I know
",0.0,0.9916,2017-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Yet another adaptation of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs character. And to this film's credit, it's nice to see an adaptation of another Tarzan book aside from Tarzan of the Apes. If only they didn't ruin the character in the process.It's somewhat noticeable that the Wikipedia article for this movie doesn't refer to the main character as Tarzan. He's John, John Greystoke, a former ape man that has returned to the land of his forefathers and become civilized. Which is precisely the problem. I'm not saying such a storyline couldn't work. The books themselves did it in The Son of Tarzan, and it worked very well. Rather the problem is that of tone.Let me explain. Tarzan as a character is a proto-superhero. His popularity paved way for the superheroes of the 20th century. And like those superheroes, he was essentially, at the core of his character, an ideal. A somewhat racially insensitive, overblown and colonially inspired ideal, but an ideal none the less. He was more than a mere man. In him intermixed myth, legend and the potential of mankind. Just like they do in modern comics and movies.Which is why it is so hard for me, as an avid Tarzan fan, to watch a movie where my beloved childhood icon loses most of his fights, barely survives in the jungle, is weak in spirit and in speech, shows disdain for Africa and overall resembles the original character only in the broadest strokes possible. And yes, I know that they were merely trying to make the character and the story more realistic and modernized in values. But this is Tarzan. It's like making a story about Zeus where the central conflict is Hera filing a divorce against him for cheating on her with multiple women, men and animals. It would be more realistic and modern, yes, but is that really what you would like to see.Aside from Tarzan the movie has its ups and downs. The cast is plenty strong with Christoph Waltz, Margot Robbie and even Samuel L. Jackson lending their talent. The CGI is okay, the costuming looks good and the aesthetics overall are pleasing. The ending is a bloated CGI mess. You know you probably should use a bit more money on effects when The Lion King did almost the exact scene more convincingly over two decades ago.The Legend of Tarzan failed to impress me. Its main character is horrible, its story is forgettable and overall it only has a few big name actors and some nice visuals to offer."
" Overdosis of sexism and white supremacy
",0.0516,0.9863,2017-06-22 00:00:00,4,"I found it a try hard to be PC film that in the end is racist and extremely sexist. The main character is a white man, it's OK, Tarzan is an old character and he's white, but he's stronger, more intelligent and understands animals better than anybody else, he could even fight with a gorilla. The strongest human would never be able to fight fairly against an alpha gorilla without the use of weapons. The try hard PC factor was the black American character, George. He's black, but he's American. All native Africans were secondary and not so brilliant as the 3 main white males. The white villain is a mature man with no remarkable physical attributes that could fight with very strong African warriors. And the only female character is a woman that had a miscarriage and wants to have a baby to complete her happiness. The film sends the most toxic possible message to women: motherhood is what will make a woman feel complete and happy. Tarzan is a super hero that can beat everything, his wife is a fragile pretty woman that waits to be saved by him. Overdosis of sexism and white supremacy."

Moreover, in my opinion I believe, the movie should shown clearly, that how Tarzan unites all the tribes of Africa for a final battle against 20,000 soldiers rather than pursuing, when he knew Pom had already retrieved the diamonds. Furthermore, I liked that they changed the story-line rather than keeping it a children's book classic."
" Tarzanless
",0.0,0.8897,2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"Well, here we have a new Tarzan movie, and again is a sequel. We are really suffering from sequel fever lately, with so many rethought sequels from classic books (see Alice in Wonderland for example), we are getting soo used to it that it no longer excites us to what some movies. So here is the turn for Tarzan, king of the Apes, or so.The story takes place after the story we all know, which was: Tarzan is in the jungle, he meets Jane, there is some bad guy, they win, and they are happily together and go back to England. Don't worry, in this movie there are flashbacks where they explain this to you (as if you didn't know the story already). So in here they are in England and they have to go back to Congo to get some businesses done, and they get to remember who they were, and there is also a bad guy again who wants something from them, etc.The plot is weak, it we can call it a plot. The action is not in the right places and dialogues are a bit dull. of course, Margot Robbie is wonderful as always and Alexander Skarsgård is good to look at (sorry, I am a True Blood fan, sigh). And although Christoph Waltz tries to be the bad guy, he is not as good as he has us used too (please watch Inglorious Basterds). So in all, you might yawn at some point but you will keep your eyes open to see how the story ends.So, yes, this is another adventure movie which is a sequel (I have lost track of how many sequels have I already watched in 2016). One movie that will leave your mind once you step out of the cinema and will leave you wondering, ""I think I really liked the Disney one""."

He is married to Jane (Margot Robbie) but they are still recovering from a recent lost. The Congo has been claimed by Belgium King Leopold II but it is driving his country to bankruptcy. His representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) agrees to a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou). In exchange for diamonds, Rom promises to bring him Tarzan for revenge. King Leopold requests Tarzan for promoting the Congo. He is reluctant but American envoy George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) needs him in his investigation of possible enslaving exploitation of the Congolese.It's an ambitious effort to bring a sequel to the Tarzan story. Tarzan may be a well-known story but one would expect it to be redone with the reboot. Instead, we're jumping right into a sequel and it's a little jarring. Tarzan and Jane come off the cover of a romance novel. SLJ is trying to inject limited comedy while the rest has no interest in it. There are some big action scenes but the sad tone and plodding pace saps most of the tension. They are probably better off playing it safe and going back to Tarzan's more well-known source material."

You can get away with cliché dialogue, two dimensional characters and unrealistic stunts in a cartoon, because...... well, because it's a cartoon and the audience knows it's not real from the start. An animated film gives the director a certain amount of creative license so that he/she may stretch the boundaries of what is physically possible without us all shouting 'Hey that's ridiculous'. However, try to recreate that stuff with real actors and it just falls flat. It's simply not believable and we don't feel empathy for the characters.

Not at all, as it continues where the story leaves off. There are fantastic performances by Alexander Skarsgard, Margot Robbie, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Waltz, and Djimon Hounsou, but Alexander as Tarzan and Margot as Jane were the standouts and perfect for the roles.

The he pacing is non-existent and to be frank one of the worst films I've seen. Stick to the black and white 50/60s versions"
" Painfully average
",-0.5267,0.5429,2017-04-27 00:00:00,5,"There are arguably 2 major issues this movie has: the CG and the script. When the movie started, it opened with a gorgeous African view and I thought to myself, ""Well, even if it is not going to be good, it will at least be pretty"". Movies set in Africa automatically get extra points just because they are set in a country that is naturally beautiful and atmospheric. However, as the movie continued, almost everything except the actors was computer-generated, including things that did not need to be computer-generated, like trees, or a train. There is a scene where a man is walking his pet crocodile. They do not show the man's face so it would have been easy to hire a trainer with a real crocodile but even this croc was fake.CG is always going to be an issue when you chose to make a film with animals as active characters, but another such film, The Jungle Book, at least made sure that everything looked impeccable. The same cannot be said for Tarzan, with its fake blurry steam train looking like it came out of an Xbox game. So much CG pulls you right out of the movie.Poor CG however does not break this movie. The terrible script does. This problem can be roughly divided in 3 parts: the slow first half, the bad exposition and the poor dialogue. The first half of this film has a pacing problem, as it takes its sweet time with setting up the return of Tarzan to the jungle, suffering under the weight of the need to connect the current events to the original story of Tarzan through countless flashbacks, which brings us to the bad exposition. There is so much of it and it is so blunt. Every character's motivation is spelled out, and everything that is not talked about, gets shown in flashbacks. Can't find a clever way to explain what is happening? Just let the character describe it out loud. Film-making! And none of the dialogue is particularly good, nor does it fit well with the action, so all that extra talking really doesn't do this movie any favors. On top of that, there is a scene towards the end in which a character does something that makes no sense within the scope of this story, a final nail in the coffin for this flick.Perhaps this film could have been saved with good acting. I only watched this movie because it promised Christoph Waltz, and his performance is fine, but there is a scene in which a Belgian officer played by Simon Russell Beale talks to the character of Christoph Waltz, and the performance given by Mr. Beale is considerably more captivating than that of Waltz, and Christoph Waltz is supposed to be the main villain, for crying out loud! While this movie is not a complete wreck, it is painfully average, and in a world with so much other entertainment available, ""average"" might as well mean ""useless""."
" He Tarzan, me sad.
",-0.4767,-0.3722,2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"One of my oldest memories is watching black and white Tarzan movies on TV as a three year old kid. He was my first hero.I've waited for a new live action Tarzan movie for many years, and was so excited when I finally sat in front of the big screen with my wife to watch The Legend of Tarzan. When the movie started, my heart sank. When I saw that the villain wore a Rosary around his wrist, I immediately knew where the movie was going. The villain then used it as a deadly weapon. Later, the villain reveals that he's not really religious (the filmmakers chickened out. They didn't want to make it too obvious). He explains to Jane how he got his Rosary, and then, Jane makes a comment that's not only anti-Catholic, but offensive and unfunny in general. You don't joke about disturbing stuff like that, people...interestingly, the villain was supposed to be a homosexual, but they removed the homosexual content from the movie. They probably didn't want to be seen as bigots. Oh, the irony. Even later, Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson meets one of Tarzan's gorilla (sorry, mangani) friends. Tarzan tells him to kneel in front of the ape and perform a sexual act on it. Near the end, the villain tries to strangle Tarzan with his Rosary, and Tarzan breaks it. I really don't understand why they wanted to include disgusting stuff like that in a Tarzan movie. How does it make the movie any better? I'll admit that I haven't read all of the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs yet, but I have read a lot of comic book adaptations, listened to one of the radio shows and watched a lot of Tarzan movies since childhood, and I can't remember Tarzan joking about monkey sex. It's sad that they decided to have scenes like those in it, because the movie actually did a lot of things right. Like the earlier Tarzan movies, the action is great. I especially loved the fight scene on the train. Unlike the earlier Tarzan movies, the Africans aren't portrayed as stupid cowards, which is a good thing. There's no animal abuse in it either. The part where Tarzan meets the lions is so beautiful. The movie has a short run time compared to other action-adventure movies of today, which I found refreshing.There's a brief and non-graphic love scene in the movie that actually leads to a pregnancy! I found it hilarious that a movie with anti-Catholic jokes and imagery shows the main characters engage in non-contraceptive sex.I've seen a lot of people complain about racism is this movie. One critic even compared it to Birth of a Nation, which is insane. Like I said earlier, the Africans are portrayed as equal to white people. They complained when Tarzan movies showed blacks as inferior to whites, and rightly so, but now they whine because they're equals...must be something in their caffè lattes. To be honest, I think most of the movie critics had made up their small minds about the movie before they even saw it. ""It's Tarzan, therefore, it's racist!"".Yes, The Legend of Tarzan deserves a lot of criticism, but not for racism. Had they dropped the anti-Catholic content and disgusting humor, I would have given the movie ten stars. Hopefully, someone will make a sequel or completely new Tarzan movie in the near future without such content. A movie everyone can enjoy (except for the critics)."

Their plan hits a roadblock when a powerful local tribe rises up against them. However, the chief says he will lead them to the diamonds if they deliver to him one man - Tarzan. Meanwhile, John Clayton, the Fifth Earl of Greystoke, is living in England with his wife, Jane. He was born and raised in the Congo where he was known as...Tarzan. Now the Belgian government requests that he return to the Congo...Incredibly bad. Weak, clumsy plot that is really just an excuse for mindless action scenes. Dialogue is particularly nauseating, trite and hokey. Characters are starkly one-dimensional - dumb, fascist colonial, bullying white people vs brave, defending-their-land natives. Clearly one of the target audiences was Social Justice Warriors...So-so performances - Samuel L Jackson is particularly hammy and irritating.Other than gouging money out of dumb SJWs (a business practice I support, by the way, so maybe the movie does have one positive quality), the aim seems to be to pull in female audiences through the majority of the movie consisting of Alexander Skarsgard running around without his shirt on. Similarly, the presence of Margot Robbie for male audiences (hell, that's why I watched it!). However, neither Margot Robbie nor Alexander Skarsgard (whichever is your preference) can save this piece of excrement."

He is however a celebrity and King Leopold of Belgium has invited him to the Congo to see how far that part of the world has come under Belgian rule.However this is all a ruse set up by dastardly Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to lure Tarzan away from England. Lom has done a deal with a tribal leader for access to diamonds he must deliver Tarzan to him so he can avenge his son's death.Tarzan is accompanied by Jane and an American adventurer Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) who suspects slavery is widespread in the Congo. What Williams witnesses is Tarzan's affinity with the animals and his jungle power as he strives to rescue Jane from Rom's clutches.The film swings along nicely, we see flashbacks of how the infant Tarzan was raised by apes. Waltz picks up an easy cheque for his vile villainous turn but the script is just too straightforward. The epitome of bland just like the lead actor playing Tarzan."

She does look stunning though in earlier portion of the film. Speaking of movie, I enjoyed watching it. It shows how Men's greed is destroying the nature. Those aristocrats for the sake of their fake status leading to the killing of innocent animals. Direction was good but the story was somewhat lost as it approached the climax. I didn't find the acting of Alexander that enchanting as it was like he was taken in the film only for showing his body. Christoph was wasted for me and so was Samuel Jackson. Margot on the contrary did he job. After a good start trying to show the emotions Tarzan has for his real home, 'The Jungle' where he grew up, the story then deviated to show that he was like a superhero trying to save his lady love at the end of the day. Still director tried to show that he was a human at last when he got beaten up by the very Mangani brother with whom he grew up. Talking about the things I loved about this movie, first and foremost will definitely be Margot Robbie. Beside that the beautiful cinematography was unforgettable. It shows what this world has and what are we destroying. I like the concept of the very same thing, ""Greed of men destroying Nature."" Direction was also good and the side characters acted well than the lead. Overall, one time watch movie."

Personally found the movie very enjoyable, well choreographed action and beautiful to watch. Outstanding cinematography and musical score. A very well written, touching story with substance,a human element not yet depicted with bits of humor added. None of those old ""Me Tarzan,you Jane"" scenes likely considered hokey by today's standards. Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) and Jane (Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified life in London, where Tarzan claimed his birthright of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke. Samuel Jackson as real-life historical figure, Dr George Washington Williams draws them back to Africa on a quest to save the Congo by exposing the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium. Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom the bad guy. Fine acting by all characters. An adventure that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, would most likely be proud of.Note: Consider reading Amazon reviews.

Save for Alexander Skarsgård's stupid expression for the entire movie, there really isn't a lot to rip on this movie for. Yet there is not a single thing to appreciate. It's predictable, it's got attractive actors, and it's all around just an average movie. It's like the director and producers pulled out their checklist with everything a movie needs to function, then built a script around each thing on that list. Attractive actors? Check. Flashbacks? Check. Rushed introductions to the characters' previous life and connections? Check. Quirky comic relief character? Check. Over-the-top climax? Check. Doesn't matter whether or not it actually makes sense, so long as it makes money. That's this whole movie. It's not special, it's not interesting, it's terribly, hopelessly generic and it gets worse with every passing second, whether I'm watching it or thinking about it.

" Disappointing for a long time fan of the character
",-0.2263,0.7661,2017-03-02 00:00:00,4,"I saw another review where the author assumed that most negative reviews came from viewers who disliked Tarzan or didn't know anything about it, so I felt the need to add my two cents as a long time fan of the character.I've read the first novel and saw most movies based on it, from the very first Tarzan of the Apes from 1918 to Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan from 1984 (which I consider to be the definitive cinema rendition of the character) and the Disney version from 1999. Needless to say I had high expectations about this one, but was at the same time afraid that they would destroy the character by trying to appeal to the mainstream.Unfortunately that is precisely what happened. Quick history lesson: Tarzan, as he is depicted in the first book, is pretty damn politically incorrect by today's standards. So, what did the filmmakers do? Simply put, they completely bastardized the character. Where the original Tarzan hanged native africans from trees, the new one befriends them, and where the former killed lions single handedly armed just with a knife and rope, the latter - you guessed it - also befriends them.And yes, I'm aware that this movie depicts a later stage in his life and, sure enough, in the latter books he actually befriended some natives and raised a lion cub, but here we never get a glimpse into this darker chapter from his early life, which would've helped immensely in giving the character some depth. Instead what we get is a perfect good guy who does no wrong, and who has an almost fantastical ability to communicate with animals and make them do his bidding.Take away any of the blood and gore that characterized the earlier books, because they need that Pg-12 rating to get the kids' money, add plenty of shiny cgi and a villain as rounded as a paper sheet (when will Christoph Waltz get the role he deserves?) and you got yourself the safest and plainest movie you could get.This film does a disservice to any long time fan of the character, and is only useful as a watered down introduction of the character to younger crowds. If you want to see a good depiction of Tarzan go watch Greystoke instead or, if that's to violent, the Disney version."
" A good fictional adventure thriller, but...
",0.6808,0.9785,2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"The saddest part of the movie is that it looked like the Africans prevailed. They didn't. The Belgian exploitation of the Congo is one of the worst genocides in history. Have a look at a book entitled King Leopold's Ghost. Historians allow for as many as fifteen million and no fewer than one million Africans murdered to satisfy Leopold's desire to make money from the production of rubber, not diamonds. All of us ought to be offended, not just Africans, that the movie made it look like the indigenous people needed the courage, strength, and decency of one white, rich, Englishman to resist exploitation. It is as ridiculous as managing wild gorillas, lions, and wildebeests as if they were toys in a video game. And gorillas swinging through trees? Really?All that aside, this movie is a pleasant distraction. Yes, it is comic book grade entertainment, but there is a reason comics have survived for so long. They have for the same reason the original Tarzan books were successful. Life is long enough to allow for hours here and there to be frivolous. And most of the actors are fun to look at. So suspend your need for realism and enjoy."

They spent a lot of $ on meaningless special effects. Apparently, they thought the way to engage an audience was to have lots of motion on screen - running, jumping, swinging, etc. Here's an idea: just have the actors and CGI animals run around in circles for two hours.

And the action it gets injected with works quite well, not to mention all the great actors in it too (Sam Jackson and especially the always great villain Waltz).But the fantasy and adventure aspect alone may give you reason enough to watch this. The movie does try to give this an extra jolt by messing with the time line and hopping around a bit. This may very well be a stroke of genius or something you don't like at all. The special effects on the other hand should be something to cherish. Nice and good fun with a couple of interesting tweaks and twists. Nothing you won't expect or surprise you too much of course"

It seems that Hollywood has retired all of their stuntmen and put the CGI companies on retainer.The actual story was good, and seemed to follow the original book better than most Tarzan movies, and I couldn't help think how much better this flick would have been received if Tarzan was actually swinging on vines like Johnny Weissmuller did in the 40s and 50s. Yates wasn't satisfied with the fact that we have HD now, and his cinematography could win the day. He had to make 50% or more of this movie animated.It was really the lazy and expensive way out, because Yates didn't have to use any real animals, he just had someone draw them. I guess if you're a millennial, and you grew up with this cartoon world as your main source of viewing movies, you would expect no less from Yates and company to fill your screen with animation and action that is so far from reality, it looks like it was filmed on another planet.It's a stretch for me to give this 5 out of 10 stars, but the acting and story were sound, so I'll be generous. However, this movie was CGI'd to death, and my gut wants to give it 3 out of 10 stars. NO. I don't recommend it. Go rent a good animated movie instead. It will be more believable."

Christoph Waltz played his usual bad guy, and even the amazing Djimon Hounsou made the best of a small part.So, see the film for the expansion of the Tarzan story to include the history of the era, the beautiful costumes, wonderful acting and some truly amazing scenes."

Casting was generally superb. Margot Robbie was a convincing and beautiful Jane and Christoph Walz was his usual urbanely villainous self although he's in danger of being typecast having played the same role in his last three or four films. .But the fatal flaw in the casting was Tarzan himself. Having a great body wasn't enough for me; Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan was too wooden an actor with a generally inexpressive face. Yes, he looked like an aristocrat but not like Tarzan. Imagine a young Sean Connery in the role - perfect. Tom Hardy nearly made the part and too bad he didn't. Did you ask yourself how did an ape man manage to shave in the jungle? Or more to the point, why would he? OK, Johnny Weismuller was beardless and so were all the other cinematic Tarzans but still a scruffy beard would have been more realistic."

But when it popped up on HBO I figured, eh, what the hell. I was expecting the classic Tarzan story and was surprised that this film actually attempted a historical narrative ... an inaccurate and idealized one, but it was a decent effort. If nothing else it might make people look up who King Leopold II was. But just like Tarantino did with Inglorious Basterds, Legend of Tarzan tells a story of how we wish history had gone. If only man and beast had fought side by side to toss Leopold's sadistic, dismembering, cronies out of the country leaving the natives and the animals in peace. Instead of the brutal genocide of millions of Congolese in a region full of rubber not diamonds.Historical inaccuracies aside, I found the action to be engaging, the CGI didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, Skarsgard is an excellent Tarzan, I really enjoyed Jane, and Christoph Waltz is as vile a villain as ever. You can't help but love him. The acting was above par for an action film, Skarsgard had good chemistry with both Jackson and Robbie. I liked the story and I think the film brought a level of depth and emotion to the tale that exceeded my expectations. It's Tarzan people not Shakespeare. Of course the plot is predictable, it's not an original story. The character has been around for over a century. It's a half-naked dude raised by apes who swings on vines and jumps off cliffs, I'm not sure why anyone would expect it to be realistic. It's an action flick not a documentary, and it's a very good action flick. Enjoy it for what it is."
" All too generic, too predictable, too uninspired
",0.0,-0.933,2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2016. The director is David Yates, who is mostly known for his Harry Potter work and the script is by Brewer and Cozad for whom it is definitely their most known work to-date. The title is of course a giveaway what you can expect here, namely the story of Tarzan. But is it really? Not quite. The film is not about Tarzan leaving the jungle or about him getting together with Jane or anything as, when the film begins, Tarzan already lives as something like an English nobleman together with Jane and they are wearing fancy clothes and living quite the life. The transition from jungle to civilization happened before this film already. It made me think at times that this may be a sequel, but nope it is not. I think the cast is a bit of a problem here. Alexander Skarsgård from ""True Blood"" turns into a Hollywood lead actor and I am not sure if he has the range for this performance. Then again, the writers surely did not give him great material to work with. Same is true about Margot Robbie. Such a generic, uninspired, stereotypical female character really and the worst is she is basically the only female character in this film. The moments when they try to make us believe she is a hotter Dian Fossey really aren't working at all and I am still to see a performance by Robbie with which she convinces me. At least, she is relatively uptight in here for a change compared to her usual performances, even if her clothes get shorter the longer the film goes, just like with the lead actor being basically topless for the entire second half of the film. His female fans will love it. But people looking for a great cinematic experience won't care and they also won't find it.The main antagonist here is played by 2-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz. One of his wins came for ""Django Unchained"" and so it is a reunion for him with Samuel L. Jackson, even if they really don't share any scenes at all. It is funny how they basically play exactly the other character here. SLJ is the slavery-opposing sidekick to the protagonist delivering occasionally funny lines. Waltz is the most evil guy in the movie, but still only a henchman to the King of Belgium as SLJ is to Di Caprio's character. Anyway, Waltz and Jackson are also not great here, but at least they manage occasionally to elevate the really mediocre material. This film is everything but bold. The characters don't have any shades. Either they are fully evil of fully good. People may argue that the people and animals Tarzan is forced to fight, offer shades in terms of character, but I would disagree. It was never really a realistic option that these would be true antagonists. And as with the previously mentioned ""Django Unchained"", slavery is also a huge topic in this film we have here, maybe the central issue even. Another core theme would be the relationship between animals and humans. I must say that they sometimes did fine to that regard and parallel, but sometimes it also wasn't working out. A decent example would be the meeting between Tarzan and the gorilla opposed to the meeting between Waltz' character and the gorillas. It's not about defeating nature, it's about surrendering to nature in order to get its respect.A not so great example would be the final fight sequence between animals joining Tarzan in his battle and the bad guys. This one is neither high quality in terms of the story or plot nor breathtaking to watch and far from as memorable as it could have been. This weak ending is also one of the main reasons why I cannot give this film a thumbs-up overall. It is not a failure and it may work as a decent watch for people with very little expectation when it comes to blockbuster films. I am not one of these and that's why I just cannot recommend the watch here. There weren't enough good moments at all for a film with this runtime. It has one here and there, but it is not sufficient in quantity. We will see if this film gets a sequel, but I am not sure it was big enough a financial success to justify the costs. As a whole, my verdict is negative. Watch something else instead. Something that has actually individual creativity."
" Tarzan Lord of the Jungle King of the great apes is back.
",0.6249,0.9941,2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,The Legend of Tarzan gets it right. I was 10 years old when I was introduced to Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan. The Series makes it clear very clear. Tarzan is a intelligent man an English Lord. A victim of a tragic event in which both of his parents died after being ship wrecked of the coast of Africa. but Little John Clayton the III was raised by Kala she of the great Apes who lost a baby. She took Little John and placed her baby in the crib. There was a bond formed. The Apes Named him Tarzan meaning pale skin. There is a scene at the start of the film where John Clayton arrives home to see Jane teaching school. She's teaching bird calls. And John imitates the calls and enchants the kids that her shows them his hands which became accustomed to walking on all fours his hands become like that of the great ape. His body has adapted to that of the apes. Such an important detail almost overlooked. Here is John Clayton entertaining school kids about his life as Tarzan. but when George Washington Williams played by Sam Jackson in a superb role. He calls him Tarzan. And he replies with My Name is NOT Tarzan I Am John Clayton the III The Earl of Greystoke. You know he doesn't want to be referred as Tarzan the subject of cheap dime novels.Very important to note.In the novels Tarzan has also struggled to maintain his name of John Clayton the III to him that name means he is a man Tarzan means he is a Beast. But as in ERB's stories John Clayton the III must always go back to the jungle to the role of Tarzan. Here the Reason is an American George Washington Williams has reports of slave trading and abuse of the natives up in the Belgium Congo. The King of Belguim has gone broke exploring the Congo basin. And for some reason there are reports of Natives going missing and slave trading and reports of mercenaries Williams appeals to the prime Minster of England and gets help from John Clayton . His wife Jane refuses to stay behind. To her Africa is home just as much as England. When they arrive in the Congo there they discover just how dire the situation has become. The King of the lost city of Opar has agreed to give diamonds to Mercenaries and the Belguim King's agent in exchange for one man the man who killed his son Tarzan. The Blood Feud increases when the Mercenaries kidnap Jane leading Tarzan and George Williams on a grand chase to the exciting and vibrant climax that simply makes you cheer.Tarzan has been many things over the years. And like Sherlock Holmes partner and friend Dr. John Watson has been dumbed down by the still popular Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films to the extant many people think all Tarzan is ME Tarzan You Jane. And that is such a dis service to the Tarzan of ERB's novels Here we see what Edgar Rice Burroughs saw in Tarzan he is a intelligent man filled with a resolve to be a good man. But when the situation calls for it he can become the beast a smart cunning animal called Tarzan.To me this film keeps the promise made years ago when Edgar Rice Burroughs first wrote Tarzan and that the first Screen Tarzan Elmo Lincoln made. That Tarzan is More then a animal. He's a man that can do extraordinary things. Things that are impossible for a a normal man.The Legend of Tarzan is by far the best adaptation of Tarzan to date.
" The literary Tarzan; more or less
",0.0,0.9661,2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the few movies that show the ""literary Tarzan"", i.e. the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs envisioned- ""Lord Greystoke"". This movie shows has a pretty good character development; which is an absolute necessity in order to believe that he can communicate with the gorillas (how he can communicate with the lions, ostriches, and other animals is not made clear in this movie). The scenery shots are marvelous and give the viewer an idea of how beautiful this part of Africa is and why historical European settlers did go there; despite the hardships involved. Having praised this movie I must also state that one should remember that it is still a work of fiction that borders on fantasy. Tarzan is shown as a ""feral"" human; raised by animals. This has happened a few times in reality but the child inevitably grows up mentally disabled; sort of like putting a Stephen Hawking intellect in a freshman class in high school and not allowing him to progress to a higher grade ;-). To get around that suspension of disbelief some critics have pointed out that Lord Greystoke was raised by a group of advanced apes that had a language-so he could develop mentally. Well, perhaps.....""Jane"" -the marvelous actress Margaret Robbie- was never portrayed as a ""damsel in distress"" to begin with, and in this movie she is no exception. A great performance is given by her; she almost steals the show from Tarzan. Though the movie shows the Tarzan that Burroughs envisioned; it does not show the Africa Congo as depicted in the novels. Instead the movie shows what is usually referred to as ""The Congo Free State""; a still controversial era. Burroughs probably knew about this matter but due to the lack of specific information about this period (a situation that still exists today) he kept the depiction of Africa more ""generic"". This movie shows the European government as the ""bad guy"" with Tarzan being the ""good guy"". Anyway, just remember, it is fiction with even the location being fictitious (filming was actually done in Gabon; not the Congo)."

At least there was some chemistry between Tarzan and Jane, unlike in this movie.So, where to start about what's wrong with this movie?Gorillas presented as horrible monsters with no character at all: Tarzan grew up with them and here they all look the same and behave the same.Incohesive boring dull plot and style of movie: The movie is mostly serious and takes place at the end of the 19th century, but here we are listening to a blowjob joke with Samuel L. Jackson?! I was just waiting for him to say something like ""I'm gonna kill these motherf***ers, bi***"".Alexander was playing a bulked up version of vampire Eric with Supeman strength, except in the final scene, where he would almost get strangled by a tiny necklace, because the plot needed it to be like that. Come on, who has the time to think of a better or more realistic way to kill Tarzan?Samuel is playing the same role as always- a slightly comical badass. His role in this movie seems just odd.Even though Tarzan has been living in England for 7 years, with no real jungle or playground to work out, he still looks bulked and he's still as agile and strong as he would have been, if he have never left the jungleThe train scene was just ridiculous: First the never ending vines and then Alexander beats up about 30 people within seconds. It was like I was watching the Terminator or some cheesy karate movie, where guy beats a whole army.Most parts of the movie were just for show- either action scenes or six packs or gorillas pounding their chest, because you know- gorillas have to do it before every single move they make. Why would you make a movie with interesting characters or a real plot, if you can spend your money on explosion and fake vines, that look fake?The whole diamond story is shallow, uninteresting and badly developed. Maybe it had some potential, but the writers weren't capable to pull it off.There just had to be an explosion scene, because Hollywood. That is so unbelievably lame, that I can't even describe it.One positive thing: In the scene with the running bisons (or whatever they're called) I was expecting a remake of the Lion King scene, that we also saw recently in the Jungle Book remake (that is almost as bad as this remake), but they didn't copy the same scene. So, it could have been worse ;) In the end I was also expecting the bad guy turn into Captain Cook, because of the crocodiles."
" Man's Adaptation To Nature
",0.0,0.976,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"First of all, I'm surprised at the malignant reviews. This is the best Tarzan movie I've ever seen and its a breath of fresh air. The characters are well rounded, the story has a virtue, not just a naked man in the woods. There are some fabulous sights and great settings.The movie emphasizes Tarzan's love, loyalty, courage, devotion to the people around him and his counteracts of injustice. He is strong and passionate but we can see his internal contradictions; when he lives in London as a Lord or while he fights for the lives of others with bare hands deep in the jungle. He's capable of adapting and working with nature. He is a true hero and his power comes from just being a man."
" The legend of Tarzan
",0.0,0.9961,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"MOVIE REVIEW OF THE WEEK TARZAN Imagine a world where man is at one with the wild . Imagine a world where man and beast have respect for one another. Imagine a world where SAMUEL .L. JACKSON does not utter the the words ""MOTHER F---ker.""or ""GOD DAMN MOTHER F---ER"" Great movie despite the reviews calling it gray and dreary.Yes it is gray despite the backdrop of the wilderness of Africa.Could have been shot in Vivid mode . Was it dreary?I don't think so .The movie went back and forth explaining how Tazan came to be.There are a lot of people under 20 that did not see the Disney movie or George of the jungle(Mmmmm Brendan Fraser when he was ripped)So they explain it through flashback.Worked for me. Alexander Skarsgard is a really good Tarzan (sorry, Brendan Fraser).A bit moody,almost one dimensional till he got his gear off.Then he came to life.Could smiled a bit more too.Thank god they didn't get him to beat his chest and yodel Ala Johnny Weissmuller.There was yodel ling of a kind but more as a background jungle type noise. Christopher Waltz was at his creepy best .I would love to see him where he is not vile(Inglorious Barstards) or devious(Django).Loved him in both of those films.I must see his other movies.One day..... Samuel .L.Jackson was brilliant .Funny.Should have chucked a couple of them God Damn Mother f--k-en snakes at him though. Margot Robbie was also good,Thank god she didn't play the squealing Damsel in Distress more like Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean.You go girl.Provided you treat this as strictly popcorn entertainment, then there's plenty to enjoy here, particularly some terrific special effects. Would have looked good as a 3d movie with all that swinging back and forth through the trees.Some say this film is antiquated ,that it still shows a white man saving the oppressed Africans and the damsel in distress.But i didn't see it like that.It was a story written a long time ago and is just being retold .Went to Reading to see the 6 pm screening and thank god we got there early.It was chock a block and walking out pass the huge line to see the next session.Cheap tickets,cheap popcorn and comfortable seats ."
" Lifeless and uninspiring
",0.0,0.9962,2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"As one of the great iconic characters of cinema, it seems like Tarzan, Lord of Greystoke has been absent from our cinema screens for an incredibly long time. While the character may have seen his fair share of ups and downs over the last few decades - even Disney's 1999 effort is one of their least fondly-remembered films in what was a prosperous and defining era for the House of Mouse - the famous tale of the vine-swinging white man raised by apes in Africa seemed ripe for a re-imagining in our anything-is-possible times. It took 17 years for the Lord of the Apes to re-appear, but is the character still relevant? And is it possible to deliver a fresh, original take on such a familiar and old-fashioned story?For the first 20 minutes of David Yates' film, it would seem yes. Wisely opting to begin with Tarzan - here played stoically by Alexander Skarsgard - already back in England and going by his birth name John Clayton, the film avoids having to repeat the old ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" shtick well all know so well. He's a bit of a legendary figure, famous for his huge hands that have been gradually restructured after so many years running on all limbs. He is also married to Jane (Margot Robbie), the fiery woman he fell in love with back in the jungle. Eager to leave the past behind him. Tarzan finds himself heading back to the Congo when the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) requests that he travel there to report on the actions of Belgium's King Leopold. After initially declining, he agrees when American envoy George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) voices his beliefs that the Belgians are in fact slaving the Congolese natives.It's an interesting, topical start, and one that, at first at least, seems to be addressing the issue of how the tale of a white man swinging in to the save the day for his African friends would go down in our politically correct times. It's just a terrible shame that the movie becomes so incredibly dull and rather uncomfortable to watch after such a promising start. Scriptwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer seem convinced that simply acknowledging the issues of race and the stereotypical, one-dimensional role of its female lead means that they can get away with it. Jane literally states that she's not some damsel-in-distress before being carried away in much distress. While The Legend of Tarzan can be commended for being brave enough to tackle the topic of slavery, entwining images of shackled, beaten black men with CGI-laden high jinks is just plain insensitive.Still, the movie's main issue is that it's just so incredibly lifeless and uninspiring. After Tarzan arrives in Africa, Jane is kidnapped by Belgian envoy Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), and the remainder of the plot revolves around rescuing her, with some animals in between. The fact that Jane spends most of her time trapped on a steamboat gives a decent impression of the film's pace. Perhaps we have been spoiled by the CGI mastery of Disney's The Jungle Book, but the special effects, especially involving the apes, simply aren't up to scratch, and even pale in comparison to 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. One thing that certainly is real however, is Skarsgard's torso. Fair play to the guy, he's truly gone the whole nine yards, and does his best with a role that requires little other than physicality. I've enjoyed his work ever since I saw him in True Blood and later on Generation Kill, but if he is ever to become a star and allow his true charisma to shine through, he'll need better material than this."
" Wrong Actor, Bad Script
",-0.765,0.9723,2017-01-30 00:00:00,4,"Alexander Skarsgård does not convince me that he could be Tarzan. I admire the fact that he trained hard to get in shape, but he doesn't look or act like a man who was brought up by apes and can look after himself in a fight. Christoph Waltz is well he is Christoph Waltz, he is good but pretty much the same in every movie he has ever been in. Samuel L. Jackson was a pointless addition to the movie and I didn't really get what his character was adding to the plot. Margot Robbie was the only actor I believed and she stood out in every scene she was in. But this movie that could have been so good, just didn't quite get there. Why? The plot was not too bad but throughout I kept thinking, yeah right, the action was unrealistic, Tarzan fighting a Gorilla? Gorilla's could rip a mans arm off, they are ten times as strong as men. Gorilla's also do not swing through trees on vines, certainly not full grown males. I also found Tarzan inconsistent, looked a bit of a wimp in some scenes and almost super human in others. CGI in some and a weak actor in the others I guess? It is a shame because this could have been good with a better cast and script."
" Let yourself go, like Tarzan in the trees. Enjoy this film.
",0.6908,0.9493,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I must say that you need to see it at least twice to understand what's happening as a lot of the story is completely visual, and not dialogue. So you need to pay close attention. I missed a lot of visual details and visual clues the first time around as there was so much. I give it high marks because telling the story of Tarzan would be a massive undertaking and it's been done before so it had a high bar to live up to. Skarsgard was great. Christoph Waltz is always fun to watch. And I must say, I'd see any movie with Samuel L. Jackson in it. It's a good feel good story. Some people review it like it was a documentary. It was, and is, and always will be, a fantasy. This is Edgar Rice Burroughs' fantasy with a new twist."
" Ponderous
",0.0,0.8174,2017-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I should have liked this movie. I remember reading the novels when I was a kid. I've followed the Tarzan franchise over the decades.It's true that this is a gorgeous, technically well made movie.And yet it just didn't work. The movie was ponderous. There wasn't anything fun or exciting or even interesting about it. A lot of scenes were set in Victorian England. It was over-reaching. Just too much. The movie didn't engage me. For this I blame the writing and the direction.Part of my problem for me is Alexander Skarsgard. He performed his role well, but he is just not the image of Tarzan I had in my head when I read the novels. He looks more like a Russian dancer or something.It's probably worth about a 7.5 but I'm going to lower that to 6 because I'm p*ssed off at how tedious it was."
" Everything I hoped it would be!
",0.4389,0.9899,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I can't believe so many people are bashing this film. I found it well worth my time. It was a great action film with a rich story (without being bogged down with all the backstory), and with characters with real depth. Alexander Skarsgård really brought Tarzan to life, speaking more through action than dialogue. Margot Robbie was excellent as usual, a strong-willed Jane fitting as the wife of a legend. The bond between them was well portrayed without feeling forced or going over the top. Plenty of action, strong performance by all the leads, excellent sets, locations and CGI, interesting story without being overly complicated, great musical score. This film has it all! By far the best adaptation of this classic legend I've ever seen!"
" Pale and tasteless in so many ways!
",0.0,0.934,2017-01-15 00:00:00,4,"Alexander Skarsgård Is a certified hunk. Oh, yes! He could cuddle me like he cuddles that lion anytime, anywhere. And boy can he look troubled and moody, but apart from that... The plot is thin. Tarzan goes on a quest to save his wife and... Well, that's pretty much it really. And that could have been enough I guess, if there had been some fun involved. I mean, a film where a scantily clad hero swings from tree to tree yodeling loudly, there just has to be a bit of humour to carry it off. But no... The good old ""reluctant partners thrown together bickering all the time-thingy"" is to halfhearted to work here, and there isn't much else to laugh at either. (I liked the stampeding gnus though. They were hilarious.) The main problem with the film is something totally different though. It's the backdrop. A lightweight, brainless action slash adventure film set in King Leopold's Congo? ""Shocking"" is one word to describe it. An other word that springs to mind is ""tasteless"". Sure. A few Africans in chains flashes by, but that is far from enough to describe what happened in that place. The genocide, the systematic mutilations, the horror and cruelty of the exploitation... You have to fast forward to the holocaust to find something to compare it with, and if you didn't know anything about it BEFORE you saw the film, you're non the wiser afterwards. Which is extremely weak. Maybe if they had turned it into a DARK Tarzan movie. You know... Like the modern Batman series. Where the hero could have battled REAL evil, not just an unusually feeble Christoph Waltz threatening a woman. ""Oh, bad form that, old chap. Bad form."" Even the anti-imperialistic angle is so twisted it's U-shaped; a pale skinned hero saving the day and the natives gathering at the end, smiling and cheering, completely devoid of initiative. How fitting and how outdated. I'm a tad disappointed. Could you tell?"
" A decent follow up for all the fans who grew up watching the Disney movie
",0.0,0.9593,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Imagine being 12 and watching the Disney movie and being overwhelmed by the characters and the soundtrack by Phil Collins. Now, having grown up demanding a more real version with live action and roles played by actors, this movie kinda meets those needs. It is a good sequel for all those who are now in their 20s. It still is a fantastical tale, and this movie takes it to another level. The use of CG in this movie is extensive and they utilized it to the fullest extent. A temporary suspension of disbelief is required, but hey. Did you really believe there was a chiseled ape man in the jungles in Africa anyway? One that looks like Alexander Skarsgård? Ha, I wish.The movie picks up a few years after Tarzan leaves the jungles with Jane Porter. He is now firmly ensconced with civilization in Europe. What I liked was as the movie progresses, we get flashbacks from when Tarzan was a baby and how his relationship with the apes is depicted. In certain scenes it is obvious that the use of a green screen is used. But to make up for those, the plus point to counter it has to be mentioned: the cinematography in this movie. It has some beautiful imagery. It has to be said that David Yates took the trouble to get the feel of the jungle correct."
" Really good film.....liked it a lot
",0.4927,0.535,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I read the Burrough's books when I was a kid and visualized Tarzan very similar to Alexander Skarsgard...long lean musculature, dirty blonde hair and light eyes... It is fiction so unsure what the person who reviewed it with 2 stars expected but it fit my need, just as Burrough's books did. I am glad that the character of Jane was feisty and not some wilting violet which would have really annoyed me as that bubble headed bimbo in Indiana Jones Temple Of Doom whose dialog seemed to be OMG OMG Finally, I have traveled to Africa and when they say you are never the same again, they were right This film brought back many memories of Africa. It is a beautiful country..people, culture...all of it."
" Slow
",0.0,0.9684,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"It felt like watching a cartoon come to live in the big screen.Real-life link: How to act to get your job done. George Washington Williams's desired outcome was to get evidence that Congo is being enslaved and save them his motive being his conscious clearness for having helped against indians. What he needed was Tarzan. The action he first did was try to convince him like the other in the room without revealing his intention. This did not work, that's why he told Tarzan his true aim for wanting to go to Africa. That worked. Plausibility: it's Tarzan. One thing however, that added to the implausibility is how lucky Williams was in landing on that train that had all the evidence. Storytelling: I felt that the movie was very strong when it came to slow motion scenes, epic moves but the action part was not equality strong. I felt the movie moved to slow and the story evolved more based on those slow motion scenes than on solid action. Slow motion scenes are appreciated after a long action scenes, they are like the pauses in a powerful speech. The one without the other just loses value. Characters: Tarzan, it was said about him that he had wildness in him, he never showed that so I never believed that for a second. Jane, little background to her story so it was not easy to understand her or to see any sort of development. George Washington Williams was the character to develop the most. He had a plan and through the film we find out his motives that make us sympathise with him. Acting:Alexander Skarsgård was a poor choice for Tarzan. He never captures the audience, he failed to portray a lovable character. He just did not sell Tarzan or his legend."
