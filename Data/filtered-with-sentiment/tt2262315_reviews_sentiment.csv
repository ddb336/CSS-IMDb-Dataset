" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.93,2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,Love the movie and the surprises. Acting was great. Definitely worth watching.
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.6608,2021-03-24 00:00:00,1,Two young actors are irritating and caan barely says two words the lighting is all dark and not a lot happens... ending was disappointing too.. I only watched on In the hope the boys would get their comeuppance.. Wouldn't recommend
" Could have
",0.0,-0.7484,2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,Who wrote this? What were you thinking? Did you mean to make this movie just awful and not only could you not like it from the start it slowly creeps towards getting better and then just is the worst excuse for a suspense/horror/drama I've seen in a minute
" A sociopath teen and his friend conducting a ruthless experiment on an old man
",0.4939,-0.7942,2021-03-23 00:00:00,6,"People had the power to make a person look like a saint or the devil himself. These two teens conducted an experiment on an old grumpy man. It was about making him believe there was something supernatural going on. In fact Ethan the annoying teen held a grudge against that old man because he testified against his father after an altercation between his parents. He made him kill himself when Ethan went down the basement and brought up the bell she bought for his bedridden sick wife. When he saw it with the gun in his hand, he shot himself in the head because he thought he was being haunted by his late wife and he took it as a sign from his wife. They got caught red-handed by the police when Ethan and his friend was erasing their fingerprints and all in the house. They didn't do any prison time for this felony but only community service."
" Full of Suspence
",0.0,0.8016,2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,I really liked the way this movie starts and ends.And the whole movie was a great piece of suspence.
" Very boring and not worth the waffh
",-0.5038,0.2866,2021-01-26 00:00:00,2,Great acting but the movie was very boring and uneventful. It was very obvious and I was never blown away . Waste of time.
" Solid movie.
",0.1531,0.7717,2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Its a well made and fairly unique plot. Acting was good, script was solid. Maybe missed some chances on some scenes. Overall I would recommend. 7.5/10"
" Unexpected death
",-0.5994,-0.8807,2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,I foreshadowed that he might kill himself. The boys drove this man suicide.
" Who's bad?
",-0.5423,0.6749,2020-10-26 00:00:00,6,"I'm generaly not a big fan of pranks. So the movie is in a disadvantage from the get go. The fact that we have flashbacks and the now time, that show us the consequences of what occured is a nice touch. And James Caan can never do wrong. He is as intense as it gets.And without him and his really subtle performance, the movie would only be half as good. And still you have cliches and other tropes that may give you some displeasure. Annoyed or not, the movie could have been impactful - especially considering the punch it holds for the ending or conclusion of the encounters ... Unfortunately while it isn't a bad movie, it isn't a really good one either."
" So underrated!
",0.0,0.197,2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,Such a crazy movie. I didn't expect it to go the way that it did. This is one of those movies where you question in the end who was really the good guy.
" Good crime thriller suspense movie..!!
",-0.1984,0.8646,2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Two young kids decided to do prank a neibour old man for fun but they later finds mystery about that old man and they get into a major problem..
First i like this non-linear screenplay because it gives more curious to watch rest of the movie...
Must watchable movie...!!!"
" Very good albeit brutal and with caveats
",-0.2893,-0.7696,2020-06-24 00:00:00,7,"The cast is very good and it plays well.The courtroom parts sprinted through are weak and feel out of place. I think it's pretty obvious from the get-go that this experiment will go south. Plus, the courtroom parts aren't played well.It gets insanely brutal when you realize what the old man is going through and what the boys are doing to him. It's quite heart breaking, and it's really the meat here. It's very sad but it does feel really real which makes it worse."
" The end
",0.0,-0.8885,2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"In my opinion, the end of this film was a legal farce, unfortunately it happens again and again that such perversities go unpunished, damn sad and always reality."
" Brilliant Directing and very Promising Acting
",0.7778,0.6808,2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,I was sceptical at first but brilliant execution I must say.
" A chore to get through, with a good final act.
",0.4404,-0.8967,2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"While the conclusion was emotional, heartbreaking and well done the pace and characters are insufferable and its just..boring.The premise is upfront - two idiot teenagers plan to perform an experiment to see if they can drive their neighbor crazy. Unfortunately for the film theyre both just kind of awful and theres no rhyme or reason in their execution of the plan. The running subtheme is that the neighbor might be a murderer. Again unfortunately the film does a terrible job of adding layers to this progression. The neighbor mostly drinks beer and occasionally hangs out in his basement. Nothing really develops the intensity of the question until the last 15 minutes of the film when its all just dumped on the floor in front of you. I didnt hate it but it was a chore to get to the end."
" ""People See What They're Looking For!""...
",0.0,0.9384,2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"When friends Ethan and Sean (Logan Miller and Keir Gilchrist) decide to set up surveillance and other electronic equipment in their elderly neighbor, Harold Grainey's (James Caan) house, it's all part of their experiment. It's also for fun. They're out to prove that they can convince Grainey that his house is haunted. Of course, nothing goes as planned, and Grainey's reactions are... unexpected.The viewers are privy to information that the young ""social scientists"" are not. We are shown through flashbacks, a backstory that makes things far more poignant, tragic, and chilling.THE GOOD NEIGHBOR is one of the better ""found footage"" films. It's presented in a way that breaks up the typical monotony of most films of its type, also adding some effective humor to the mix. While everyone is good, Caan plays his most satisfying role since MISERY. Deserves a much wider audience..."
" Did not expect that!
",0.0,0.54,2020-04-07 00:00:00,6,"Really good. I spent the first half of this film wanting to knock those teenage boys upside the head for what they were doing,, then I thought the old man might not be so innocent,,, then,,,, well,, see for yourself,,,
so go watch it!"
" Never be the judge of the cover
",0.0,-0.5106,2020-03-07 00:00:00,4,"First things first, these kids... absolute idiots (tension identified (which is okay)). Off the rip, old dingy seems to be on that booger sugar... cheeky moon. Potentially looking for that nocturnal bust. All reality, decent guy. Hate to see a guy go out like that. Weak punishment, if it were up to me... firing squad. But hey... this ain't the time or place, period. Respect the attempt to catch a lil but this lil bitta that there by the young bull aka peepin eefin. Conclusive: woodnt even bother."
" Interesting story
",0.4019,0.2144,2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,Interesting story line but the execution didn't work. The jumping back and fourth was not needed.
" It's an 8!
",0.0,0.7269,2020-01-14 00:00:00,10,This film certainly deserves way more than a 6.3. It's definitely an 8 for me but I'll give it a 10 to help the rating.
" Surprisingly Good!
",0.6588,0.7171,2019-11-06 00:00:00,8,"This was actually a really good movie! It's like if Monster House was live action, darker, and had a bigger plot twist."
" Not the movie you'd think it would be..
",0.0,-0.1055,2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"It starts off like any other thriller/kids watching someone movie starts, and then it dives into the plot, what these two kids are doing. After that, more story unravels, but it turns out to be more sad than anything. If you're looking for a horror/thriller, this definitely isn't it, but a good compelling story with a complete ending?"
" One of the saddest movies I've seen
",-0.6124,-0.8043,2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, the ending made me SO angry and so mad, and my heart broke for the elderly man once I realized why he was the way he was. I guess this makes it a good movie in the fact that it moved me the way that it did. And that things like this COULD happen. I've even tried to re-watch it and I just started to cry because of the fact that the teenagers in the movie can be so cruel and not understand the reasoning and depth of his pain (yes, I realize it's just a movie, but it had that much of an effect on me because I have a soft spot for the elderly). Decent movie overall."
" Thought he was the ""13 Cameras"" guy...
",0.0,0.5945,2019-10-08 00:00:00,8,"...which is ironic considering who we think that old man is during the movie and who he really is. Turns out it had nothing to do with him and I discovered a very suspenseful mystery/thriller. Very good/believable acting, liked the past-present flashbacks which serve to make cool plot twists in the movie."
" Slow but interesting
",0.5499,0.0,2019-09-01 00:00:00,5,"It kept us watching but we felt it was too slow, it picked up close to ending."
" Hard to rate it even half way
",-0.1027,0.2023,2019-08-25 00:00:00,4,If they could have atleast cast high school kids that knew how to act and didn't make this info some unbelievable home video footage then I could rate it atleast a 5.
" Passed the time
",0.0,0.9531,2019-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Watched this because James Caan was in it. Reviews suggested it would have a Don't Breathe/Paranormal Activity vibe about it and I'd agree.Two kids surveil and ""haunt"" Caan as a an alleged social experiment and document it all in a found footage style.Caan plays the miserable old guy perfectly and still has great presence, pretty good for a ""150 year old""!It moves at a steady pace and rewards you at the end with a solid twist."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,0.9826,2019-06-07 00:00:00,8,"Ethan (Logan Miller) and Sean (Keir Gilchrist) are best friends, friends who know that Ethan's neighbor, Harold Grainey (James Caan) is not a very nice person. One night the boys are up late playing video games, when they come up with the idea to screw with the evil old man across the street. They decide to trick the old man into believing that his house is haunted, but they have no idea the kind of person they are messing with. The Good Neighbor has so much going for it, especially when it comes to suspense. A lot of films claim that they will keep you on the edge of your seat, but this one really will. I'm not a jumpy, edge of your seat type person, but this film got me. Another thing I really enjoyed was not only the dynamic between the veteran actor and the two newcomers, but how different their characters were. First, we're following this miserable angry old man, then we're seeing kids in the prime of their life, screwing around, and having fun. It's the kind of thing a lot of people don't recognize, but it is extremely hard to pull off a two parted story, when the sides are so drastically different. James Caan was of course terrific as he is always is, but so was Keir Gilchrist. This kid continues to give these tremendous performances in these little known independent films. I think he is going to be a huge star at some point, but at the age of 27, he's really beyond films like this. The Good Neighbor is a rare treat, because it has two stars that are arguably too good to be in such a small independent movie. Paired with a terrific story, thrilling action, and a unique dynamic. This is one of those rate film we're proud to label as a must see movie!"
" Brilliant!!
",0.658,-0.8856,2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,"I had no idea this movie was what it turned out to be!! It was very sad because he loved his wife so much he couldn't let her go........
These boys tormented this poor old man to death!!"
" Premise is misleading & film wasn't up to scratch
",-0.4019,-0.9197,2019-05-06 00:00:00,4,"The films poster & premise make this film seem as if the neighbour himself is the villain of this story, but you find from watching that this isn't the case.The film is about 2 boys who decide to play ""haunting"" simulations on their neighbours house because they have some perceptions on the elderly man.So with the similar set up with Paranormal Activity Franchise, the boys start to torment the old man through a series of simulated haunting's like banging doors to temperature change to even weird noises etc. But they soon begin to realise that he is the last person they should annoy.Like I said before, the films premise & poster are misleading. The story was the complete opposite of what I was expecting. Even when you are presented with the first half of the premise, the other half is not what you're expecting.The film for the most part was boring & lacked action. Like the Paranormal Activity Franchise or other films of the found footage genre, it drags & drags until it gets to the end to which finally something happens. I mean ok, some things did happen during the film when the boys were taunting the man, but the majority of the film was just them mucking around or something.The films end took me though, but not in the way that was good. I kind of felt cheated in a way to be honest. The films end itself wasn't exactly satisfying & pretty sad.Overall, misleading & not really great. 4/10"
" 4 out of 10 spoops
",0.0,-0.5523,2019-04-25 00:00:00,4,"My first thought was the IRB would never approve this study. There isn't even a consent form.Also, Harold looks like Bernie Sanders.I thought the movie itself was alright. I felt as though the characters were limited to ""annoying white boys"" or ""creepy old man"". I thought that the recaps of the previous scenes were unnecessary. Like I just saw this why are we still talking about it. There was a lot of dead space throughout which made the movie drag.The most intriguing part of the whole movie was the court scene that would give the viewer a more analytical perspective about what went down.All in all, 4 out of 10 spoops."
" Was a really good movie
",0.4927,0.9175,2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,"It was a long but really good movie, great thriller."
" The Guilty Cleared
",-0.34,-0.9478,2019-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Way too much of the film portrays nothing much more than two irksome punks in their pranking glory; but as it plods to a head, it is revealed that one of them is a loathsome sociopath leading the way to tragedy. Excellent acting, especially by James Caan as the crotchety old man with a bitter edge whose character develops powerfully. This movie insightfully examines weighty subjects including human depravity, broken family, peer influence among youth, terminal illness, lost love and loneliness among the aged, and of course ethics and justice (not in the horror genre). This is not an uplifting story, and the ending is somewhat disturbing, leaving a lot to be thought about."
" Excellent n thought provoking
",0.4404,-0.6894,2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant well written n acted movie. The twist at the end was extremely tense as it was throughout.
CCTV although it was secretly planted was especially frightening given the fact it was merely to frighten. I thought it was a unique way to portray the consequences of snooping on someone with a dire outcome.
A must see for any age group."

Other film and TV vets including Laura Innes (""ER"") and Anne Dudek (""Mad Men"") along with burgeoning young stars like Keir Gilchrist (""United States of Tara"") and Logan Miller (""The Walking Dead"") pool their considerable talent to make this dramatic and tragic story behind a story well worth the watch."

I was not disappointed in it at all. There's a pretty decent plot twist, very good acting, and a really good over all feel. Man, I recommend watching this one."
" Boring waste of time
",-0.6249,-0.9352,2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"What a waste of Caan's talent. The plot was billed as 2 teens experiment on a neighbor by ""haunting"" his home and then see how it affects him. The problem was they didn't really even haunt him. I was expecting a series of haunting-like pranks like moving objects and increasing the intensity of it until the neighbor gets more and more freaked out until some kind of climax happens. Now THAT would be a good plot. Hey - I should have written the screenplay! Instead they did lame things like break the thermostat so he would get cold, but the only effect was he got cold and just thought the thermostat was broke. Lame. Very boring and sloooooooooow. Total waste of time."
" Really enjoyed this film :)
",0.7645,0.662,2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Kinda spoiler:
This film wasn't what I was expecting, I expected this to be an deranged old man who was going to kill these kids or had bodies in his basement, I was really surprised and happy with the film conclusion, me and my girlfriend guessed the ending about half way through the film and where happy we were correct, it was so refreshing to see something different."
" Not what you may expect.. and that's good
",0.4404,0.3932,2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"When I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix, the general description of the movie, plus the fact it had James Caan in the cast (an actor who has appeared in mostly schlock in recent years) made me think I would be getting a standard B movie thriller. The end results, however, kind of surprised me to a degree. For one thing, the youthful lead characters are not portrayed in a way that really gives them any sympathy; I think even youths who watch the movie will see these characters as being cruel and insensitive. The narrative is also more skillfully told than you might think, not laying out its cards on the table right away, but giving us some important plot points one by one, and not always in standard order. Also, the note that the movie ends on makes this story more of a tragedy than anything else. The movie is not perfect; there are a few plot points (like the stain on the carpet a cop finds early on) that are kind of vague or not expanded on enough. But despite the occasional stumble, this movie is very watchable, making the viewer curious enough to keep watching until the very end. Don't watch this movie if you are wanting schlocky thrills, but if you want to see a fairly realistic thriller of sorts that shows that life is not always fair or happy, give this sleeper a try."
" Neat Premise, Bad Execution
",-0.128,-0.8474,2018-10-07 00:00:00,2,"Slow pacing, with scenes that easily could have been cut from the film. The main characters were annoying and at times, hypocritical. It's not tense or suspenseful. Around the halfway mark, I was still confused to why they were doing what they were doing and the story seemed to drift sideways. I'd give this movie a pass. It's in a the ""found footage"" style but doesn't stick with it. Based on the logline, I was expecting more of something in the style of War Games. The drama between the two boys was lacking substance and a deeper meaning. They spent most of the movie drinking while justifying their actions of spying on this old man because he's a ""drunk""."
" Excellent acting and story line
",0.5719,0.9101,2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I rarely reviewed any movies that I watched, but this movie deserves its own review!It's on Netflix and the movie is well paced, keeping the suspense and boy it has a very perfect ending to it! The story telling technique was also on point!Highly recommended to watch it now on Netflix!"
" Suspenseful and gripping
",0.0,0.9779,2018-08-30 00:00:00,7,"After a fairly lacklustre start, The Good Neighbour turns into an imaginative, tense and gripping film. A genre let's face it that has been done to death in recent years, I can think of so many similar films, but this one actually does a great job. The scenario is a little different, you get to see two sides of the story, it's more in the psychological drama genre, it's tense and suspenseful. It is very well acted, everyone plays their part well, it would have been easy to overact. The final showdown was good, but I wish they'd have made it a little more suspenseful, it was a little underdone.Overall I thought this was a very good film, very watchable. 7/10"
" Surprisingly well made
",0.5106,0.9765,2018-08-29 00:00:00,7,"This movie is truly original, well thought-through, witty and clever. To be frank, i didn't expect this movie to be nearly as good, simply due to the seemingly immature premise.  Although very limited character involvement is used in this movie it does its job of keeping the suspense throughout and there's not a single moment where the movie feels boring or a waste of time, yes, the runtime is relatively short and i can assure you the producers haven't filled it with irrelevant filler shots. Although the main focus wasn't on this movie being a mind twisting thriller, it still accomplishes fooling you at times and being 1 step ahead for most of the runtime, people could argue some of the actions could have been foreseen, but for the most part it was hard telling how the story was going to unfold in hindsight. Overall not a bad watch, has a little bit of suspense, thrill, drama and even a bit of fun at times, a really well rounded little flick with decent acting that surely does not disappoint!"
" Suspenseful but Somewhat Disappointing
",-0.5941,0.1027,2018-08-21 00:00:00,6,"A unique and very suspenseful story which easily kept my attention throughout, but some parts are rather poorly directed. Fine acting by James Caan and by Logan Miller, whose character seems more and more despicable as the movie goes on.The ending looks like it's going to be satisfying, but there's a sad decision at the very end in court. The sadistic Ethan should have received a prison term, but instead he gets sentenced to just community service and probation."
" Effed me up
",0.0,-0.8248,2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Like i'd mentioned in another review of mine you don't have to go back trying to find for any context or anything, it is difficult to review certain kinds of movies like this, wherein the ending not just comes as a shock or twist, but completely and utterly upends the entire movie you spent the past 90-120 minutes watching.
To a certain degree, it can make a review easy. Just say ""It was fun, nothing extraordinary until the ending which completely upended the entire movie""
the film opens with a description of a british experiment (which may or may not be real) in which researchers told a group of people that they would hire random people for a period of time to subtle interact with them or interfere with their lives in very minor ways. After the end of the experiment, all the volunteers mention how the experiment changed their lives, and it's revealed the experimenters did not actually hire anyone; the mere insinuation was the experiment.
this opens the film, in which two teenagers come up with an experiment along those lines, hidden under the polished hypothesis of how to slightly interfere with the life of an old man, to hide the fact that it amounts to breaking and entering and harassment as they hide cameras in his house and set up various contraptions to try to convince the old man his house is haunted.
throughout, we get very slight insights into the man, Harold Grainey, played perfectly by James Caan, which essentially shows us a tired, unhappy, unpleasant old man wasting away his final days in his house and threatening the neighbor's dog for pooping on his lawn.
the film also early on reveals a framing device in the form of a trial, much like ""The Free State of Jones"", ostensibly spoiling for us the result that the teens get caught and get in trouble. But the court scenes are deliberately evasive, light on details, not showing us who specifically is on trial, or who is present at the trial until it becomes necessary to reveal it.
These court scenes are a great way at giving us exposition as well as setting up the next act without coming across as contrived or overly expositional.
As the experiment progresses, it goes through the typical ebbs and flows of a usual movie, with escalating tension and drama, things that go wrong, personal conflicts and drama. The way Caan plays his character and the seemingly random oddities he exhibits, such as sitting up in bed and staring into space for a full hour, or his behavior in his basement, are utterly compelling, and keep you drawn in even as the story seems to be headed towards an inevitable ""rocks fall everyone gets arrested""
But then comes the ending. Even hinting at what happens feels like a cheat to this movie. The ending completely and irrevocably changes the whole tone and mood not just of the court scenes and the story, but the character of Harold Grainey and every little action and oddity that he does. It completely messed me up and I was nearly in tears. It does no justice to spoil anything more than that."
" What a thriller. NOT
",0.1027,-0.9551,2018-08-04 00:00:00,1,"Such a waste of time. Seriously. I could watch a better movie. Not only there was absolutely nothing thrilling going on, the entire time I hoped for those stupid teenagers to drop dead. Also, the court scenes were absolutely pointless. They didn't contribute to the plot whatsoever. The plot twist- nothing surprising nor shocking. Whoever was quoted in the trailer that said ""would make Alfred Hitchcock proud""- please kill yourself. 
All in all- a terrible movie. Well, at least I didn't pay for it."
" Terrible tragedy
",-0.8176,-0.9638,2018-07-24 00:00:00,3,"The true horror occurs at the end of the movie, as justice is denied. Just how terrible, and cruel, two high school boys can get is approached in this film.

Some ""get on with it already"" moments. But I had to know where this was headed, so the film did enough good things to keep me wondering. You will need to forgive a few moments of implausibility to enjoy this one... the film might have benefited by showing how they set up their fake haunting pranks.The prosecuting attorney, by the way, looked exactly like an actor portraying a prosecuting attorney on TV, rather than an actual prosecuting attorney, if you know what I mean. Back to acting school, lady.Worth watching if you can look past a few flaws."

It was also unjust at the end, but it did leave certain life questions in the air which amounted to a great deal of thought provoking throughout. All acting was superb, all scenes shot were faultless to a novice like me, and all loose ends were neatly tied up. Reality rarely comes through as much as it did in this movie, this is one of those, ""under the radar"" gems that shines above the rest, and all the more so since no one has heard of it. I would recommend this for a quiet watch, uninterrupted if possible."

Things, of course, end up going very wrong. The movie first appealed to me because James Caan is in it. I mean...Why would he choose to do a junk movie at this point in his career, right? Well, I wasn't disappointed.The downsides of the movie are: (1) Not a whole lot of action; (2) Shot almost entirely in low light; (3) Slightly drags in the middle.Upsides are: (1) Interesting plot; (2) slow building suspense; (3) Ending full of multi-layered emotions.RECOMMENDED"

",0.4168,0.9253,2018-01-24 00:00:00,7,"This is really refreshing. Something rare and unpredictable film in a thriller. Nice characters and the setting where all the story takes place. This is about two teenagers secretly trying to video document one of their neighbours after judging his character through several events of his life. So they place hidden cams in his house, expecting something twist to happen. As the story goes on, they face various troubles and what result they get in the end was a shocker.I think nicely written film. Not much fuzz about the characters or any events. Though there were some scene that puts the views on the edge of their seats. Overall a nicely made film, either quality or the quantity, totally acceptable. The actors too were good. The kids and then the Jame Caan. The suspense was the backbone of the film. It succeeded on that, but don't anticipate anything bigger. It is a simple, small thriller that's surely worth a try.7/10"

" Hardly enjoyable, but it's more mature than most
",0.7134,0.4951,2017-12-14 00:00:00,6,"THE GOOD NEIGHBOR is a thriller perhaps too successful at what it sets out to do. The protagonists are a couple of extremely unpleasant American teenagers who decide - for a prank - to make the life of their elderly neighbour a misery. To this end they set up various hidden cameras in his home (to allow for some found footage-style suspense and thrills) and then proceed to trick him by turning his heating off, making his door bang, and various other stupidity. Things gradually spiral out of control until a twist ending. If it all sounds a little like DISTURBIA then that's because it is, but this film does turn out to be more mature and philosophical about the subject matter than most and the ending is decent. The main actors are sufficiently irritating but the highlight is old-timer James Caan who does very well in a difficult role."

Usually they're just a clichéd mess.I was close to switching this off after 20 minutes. It just seemed like two annoying teens setting up a dull Paranormal Activity-style bore. The only reason I kept going was James Caan, who played his role with understated menace well enough to reel me in.By the halfway point I was genuinely enjoying the mystery, even if I was ultimately expecting a stereotypical conclusion. However this is a film defined by its brilliant ending; one that is true to the set-up and which has an impact rare in the majority of films. My only criticism is that the way the film pretends to be one thing whilst actually being something else is likely to either alienate most of the audience it is being sold to, whilst at the same time not appealing to those who will really appreciate it."

",0.0,-0.9387,2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"It's rare for a movie these days to come up with something unique by way of story, but this one's twist ending is bound to create an awareness in the viewer that things are not always as they seem. Up until that point, the picture was dragging for me, primarily due to the shrill relationship between teenage buddies Sean (Keir Gilchrist) and Ethan (Logan Miller). They get involved in what they call their 'Haunting Project', a deliberate attempt to scare their next door neighbor, a neighborhood curmudgeon named Harold Grainey. Grainey's reputation has taken a hit over recent years due to the death of his wife, and the story's non-linear exposition of Grainey's true character is what makes the story's resolution so stunning. All the while I'm waiting for Harold to go big time Sonny Corleone on the pair of instigators, and it just wasn't meant to be. If you can suffer through the emotional outbursts of the frustrating, movie-making, scientist wannabe's, the outcome will most likely affect you with a visceral response. That they seemingly got away scot-free with what might be considered a legitimate manslaughter rap only made me that much angrier."

Caan was good as the mostly confused old man who looked somewhat menacing. However, the movie is spot on when it comes to depicting the current youth's obsession with filming stuff, in this case as part of some ""experiment"". In this day and age, anyone with a half-decent camera can film whatever they like and this is a growing threat to privacy as we know it. Overall, a decent movie but somewhat lacking in chills. No edge-of-the- seat stuff here despite the intriguing premises."
" Parent Warning: NR Rating should be R
",-0.34,0.937,2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"First off, there are several good reviews on this film, but be careful not to read to much and spoil the build up. I'm mainly writing because the Parent Guide was filled out incorrectly in some areas and not filled out at all in others, so unbeknownst to me, I sat down to watch this with my teen son and immediately realized that this movie may not be appropriate for him to see. Profanity: Lots! I mean these are high school aged boys, basically troublemakers, who use a lot of ""colorful languages"". Sex & Nudity: While there isn't sexual intercourse per se, there are scenes with sexual innuendo; a girl takes her top off as they are about to have sex; as one boy watches a computer monitor you hear sounds alluding to a porn video; several posters of voluptuous women (including Debbie Does Dallas) are on the boy's bedroom wall; etc. Alcohol & Drugs: The underage boys are drinking beers throughout the movie and the absentee, single mom even catches them and just says, ""you can at least hide the beer cans""; the boys have a party which includes alcohol, smoking, drugs, sex, etc. I hope to get this info entered on the Parent Guide, but I don't have the authorization to do so yet. All that said, this movie is intriguing. Although it may seem slow or monotonous to watch people watching people (filmed mostly with hand-cams and hidden camera footage) it builds suspense/curiosity and keeps you guessing and captivated. This film has multiple layers that build on each other and as the puzzle pieces come together it comes to a satisfactory conclusion... well mostly ;)"

" Another misfiring live camera thriller
",0.1027,-0.8965,2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Suburban teenagers Ethan (Logan Miller) and Sean (Keir Gilchrist) are weary of their grouchy old neighbour Mr Grainey (James Caan) who lives across the street, and decide to invade his home and install devices everywhere, in order to spy on him and play a series of pranks. However, they have underestimated this old codger, and events build up to take a terrifying and shattering turn.This latest The Blair Witch Project/Paranormal Activity inspired effort takes the formula in a perverse direction, and has some contrasting central characters in the shape of two young ones/one old one, and plugs the generational gap together in a fundamentally unsettling tale of early on-set psychosis and reclusive paranoia. Sadly, none of it really builds up to a very satisfying whole.A forgotten actor in recent years, Caan has the same steely eyed, unnerving presence he had in his younger years, and precisely because of his age, he's able to apply it in a different, more unique way now. Miller and Gilchrist come off as little more than just your standard teenage brats. But it's not the performances that weigh this down, as much as the far fetched nature of the story and the lack of coherent storytelling that do, building up to an ending that, though unexpected and affecting, sadly doesn't lift it up any.This is one neighbour you could comfortably avoid going to check up on. **"

Recognising the title from a very good review by Kim Newman in Empire magazine, I decided to pay a neighbourly visit.The plot:Deciding to make their own secret ""social experiment"" film,Ethan and Sean break into the house of loner neighbour Harold Grainey,in order to plant hidden cameras and other electronic devices around in order to make Grainey believe the house is haunted . Over the next few weeks,Ethan and Sean spend all their waking hours watching Grainey. Desperate to wind Grainey up,the guys use devices that create random power cuts,and even break the windows. Believing that they have a camera in every part of his life,Ethan and Sean soon discover a secret door in Grainey's life that they want to unlock. View on the film:Picking up the camera for a feature film debut after spending years working on major blockbusters as a concept artist,director Kasra Farahani displays a striking artistry for various film formats,with the footage ""shot"" by Ethan and Sean being given a low-res Video grit,that neatly counters the slick digital format that spans the houses of the guys and Grainey. Recording a mix of genres,Farahani & cinematographer Alexander Alexandrov give the voyeurism of Ethan and Sean an intelligent twist,where the traditional sexual undertone is exchanged for an obsession similar to internet trolling,where the guys want to make their ""haunting"" troll Grainey to the point where it controls his life.Recording Sean and Ethan starting out on their film project,the screenplay by Mark Bianculli and Jeff Richard give the Found Footage genre a psychological horror dominance,with Sean and Ethan's recordings capturing every waking (and sleeping) moment of Grainey. Looking into each room of Grainey's life,the writers brilliantly turn the Home Invasion Thriller genre round,with it being the things on the outside,and not the ""monster"" seen inside that are the real terror. Joined by a terrific,short-fuse Logan Miller and Keir Gilchrist as Sean and Ethan, James Caan gives a fantastic performance as Harold Grainey. Speaking a limited amount of dialogue,Cann gives Grainey a ticking time bomb facial expressions,that also carry the weight of what is in the unknown room,of this good neighbour."
" A short review of ""The Good Neighbor"" (2016)
",0.4404,-0.6748,2017-04-15 00:00:00,5,"""The Good Neighbor"" (2016) generally didn't work for me.My first problem was its premise. Two teenage aspiring filmmakers play an elaborate high-tech prank on an elderly neighbor by installing hidden cameras in his home and then manipulating his environment: causing his lights and TV to malfunction, causing his windows to break, and even adjusting his thermostat to plunge the temperature so he's forced to cope with the bitter cold. They plan to mimic a haunting, and they rationalize it because he actually is a horrible person, well portrayed by James Caan in an understated performance.Here's what doesn't make sense — what the teens are doing is against the law, and they know it. (One explicitly states it at least once mid-way through the film.) I count trespassing, criminal mischief and unlawful surveillance to start with, and I'm willing to bet they'd face charges for harassment too. Yet they fully intend to makes themselves ""famous"" via the Internet with this cruel prank/documentary. They shoot lengthy footage of themselves narrating the construction and implementation of their project; this is intended as part of the documentary.But why would they upload detailed, inclusive evidence of their crimes to the Internet? If they truly become ""famous"" with thousands of ""hits"" for their video, wouldn't that mean countless people could bring them to the attention of the police? (And, truthfully, even if they tried to remain anonymous, I'm sure any competent investigator viewing their video would at least count them as suspects. One lives right across the street from Caan's character.)For much of its running length, ""The Good Neighbor"" actually succeeds at being a serviceable horror-thriller — if you can get past that hole in the premise.But then we come to the second problem with this movie. Towards its end, it takes an unexpected dramatic turn. It stops being a thriller, and simply becomes a particularly sad drama. I don't want to say to much for fear of spoilers, suffice to say it's a real downer. But it isn't frightening at all — or even terribly entertaining.The only part near the end that pleased me was the movie's final shot. It was ambiguous, but it suggested a nice new level of character depth. I thought it was neat.Oh well. Maybe others will enjoy this film more than I did. I myself can't recommend it, and I'd give it a 5 out of 10.Postscript: you can have some fun here trying to figure out where you've seen these teenage actors before. They're both veterans of horror. The mild-mannered one is Keir Gilchrist, who horror fans will recognize from ""It Follows"" (2014). The meaner, more manipulative of the pair is Logan Miller, who played the goodhearted Benjamin in this past season of ""The Walking Dead."" It's so weird seeing him play such different characters."
" Boring and pointless

The film is a mix of footage from his house, footage supposedly to record the students reactions, court scenes afterwards and flashback of the neighbour. The haunting is basically them turning the thermostat down, turning on hifi during the night etc... Pretty basic. Its hard to explain the film without giving too much away and you really have to watch the film to the end to fully appreciate it. By the end of the film though you will hate the students and feel genuinely sorry for the ""creepy"" old man. I am not really sure how to categorise the film. It is not really horror as you know the events that are suppose to be haunting are artificial. It really is just two students trying to terrorise an old man and finding out why he did not react in the way they expected him to."

While keeping his every reaction under surveillance, they see much more than they had planned on seeing......The comparisons to Don't Breathe are rife in this film, but thanks to a wonderful performance from Caan, this goes from a perfunctory to surprisingly entertaining. Most of the people who live within Caan's vicinity think he is some sort of psychotic loner, as he doesn't interact with people, goes shopping at the same time, and is a very heavy drinker.We have flashbacks that indicate that he may have been a psychologically abusive husband, as again, he doesn't really interact with his wife, and doesn't really help around the house.But whenever we revert back to the instigators of the project, the film falters to nothing more than a wannabe 'making a found footage film'. All the teenagers are your atypical culturally aware know it all, spouting an early Tarantino wannabe script. It really brings the dark tone of the film when the narrative switches to Caan.But there is a wonderful twist ending that really makes up for the films shortcomings, and redeems itself ten-fold.If you can stomach the scenes with the cringe-worthy teen scenes, you'll be in for a wonderful ending that makes up for the rest of the Caan-less scenes."

They want to see if they can make a person believe they are being haunted, without it actually being so. To do so they rig the house of an old man with cameras and some mechanics to simulate the haunting.This is what the synopsis said, and this is indeed what about 20 minutes of the movie wears out.
