" Superb performance by Gleeson. Wonderful movie. Must watch
",0.8316,0.9911,2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Calvary is a drama movie directed by John Michael McDonagh and stars Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aidan Gillen, Dylan Moran and Isaach de Bankole.This is one of the most beautiful movie showing the traits of different human that they posses and shown from perspective of a priest who sees the suffering and sins of human.Acting is superb with Gleeson steals the show with his convincing and powerful performance in the character of a good priest who wanted to heal the suffering of the person he met but gets limited success. Rest of the cast was equally superb.Screenplay of the movie is great and credit should be given to the director to hold the outcome till the very end of the movie. Climax of the movie is powerful. Cinematography is superb and music is good.A great movie with very powerful performance and a good theme. A must watch."
" A strong message & great play
",0.8689,0.962,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"This is a drama you won't regret you have watched. It raises questions every man tempts not asking himself too often, while they are the most important ones. Is a God a 'white-bearded oldster' created to fool people or is He something different? How to keep your ability to forgive when everything seems so spoiled? Brendan Gleeson's character goes through these questions and comes to the very strong answer.
Great kudos to the film crew and the film director."

" Hugely rewarding drama touching on some big themes
",0.5709,0.9829,2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,"A truly moving and thought-provoking essay on the importance of faith, Calvary is a beautifully haunting movie. The bleak serenity of the rugged Irish landscape is captured in stunning detail as a stark backdrop to the lives of Brendan Gleeson's Father James and those around him. If anything it's as much a part of the language of the film as anything scripted.There was one critic who applauded the movie for daring to highlight a systemic problem within the Catholic Church whilst also championing the case for the institutional priesthood. It's a fine balance, one which in lesser hands may have come across heavy-handed or unconvincing or even offensive. Director John Michael McDonagh has an assured grasp of the literature here, and whilst it's subjective as to whether religion itself is a necessity, the power of belief and meaning is one which pervades the very essence of this movie. Father James's parishioners are almost irredeemably arrogant and cynical, the implication being that the very presence of the Church is an insult to their way of life. A way of life which holds no purpose, a repetitious cycle of sinful behaviour (alcoholism, adultery, lust, domestic violence, murder etc.). The prevalence of this is made all the more tasteless and off-putting by its violation to Father James, who in essence is the epitome of all that is good in the film. The stoicism which he shows in the face of such mean-spirited rebuttal is such an aspirational quality which can't be overstated.One does suspect that his death is a symbolic release from the vices and bigotry of the townsfolk which threaten to eventually consume him, something which is hinted at when one night when he sees no other choice but drown his sorrows, before getting physically beaten by the pub landlord. It's as if to say the community, or reality, in which he inhibits is beyond redemption and not worthy of his decent acts of kindness and compassion. Therefore he must transcend out of this reality, despite his heartbreaking insistence that there's hope for all of us, something which is probably true but not many of us realise.One of the things which impressed me most about Calvary is its portrayal of the relationship between Father James and his daughter Fiona, their reconciliation forming the core of the movie. Their interactions never degenerate into clichéd theatrics. In a series of subtly affecting set-pieces they stroll through the country lanes, or beside the crashing waves of the coastline, or having picnic in a field, just taking time to listen to each other and understand their differences, finding empathy and solace after the tragic death of James's wife/Fiona's mum. It's a period of healing for the both of them. Their parting mediation on the importance of virtue and forgiveness is what, for me, made the very final scene between Fiona and Jack so profoundly moving. No words are spoken, but the significance speaks volumes.Brendan Gleeson is simply amazing. He handles the role with such humility and warmth, creating a totally sympathetic character within the first 10 minutes of you meeting him. Father James is clearly weary and pained, but most importantly not embittered or resentful. His conscience is clear, despite the crisis he finds himself in, handling matters with a wry tenderness and sincerity. I struggle to think of another actor who could've delivered a more touching performance."
" Does everyone have a breaking point?
",0.0,0.4927,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"How long will you last before you finally snap and give up?
And would the answer change if you were a priest?
While different people have different capacities for tolerating ugliness, injustice and atrocities, one thing is fairly certain: everybody has a breaking point. This is what makes us human. This movie reminded me a little of Bergman's 'Winter Light', which is also about a man of cloth having a crisis of faith, although the latter is a superior film. The comparison to the other film takes nothing away from this one, since this film is also a beautiful piece of work. The name of the movie 'Calvary' is a reference to the place outside of Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified.Not for those who are easily offended, 'Calvary' takes us into the world of the priest, Father James. The setting is a county in Ireland and the surroundings are hauntingly beautiful with lush green meadows, the magnificent sea and equally mesmerizing beaches. However beautiful the surroundings, as a priest, our protagonist's main concern is what's on the inside of his parishioners. Unfortunately, what he finds there is not pretty at all. In fact, more often than not, it is shockingly ugly and unimaginably horrific. As Father James goes about his business of providing spiritual guidance to his flock, we get a feeling that some of those may be way past redemption. Most of his parishioners are not nice people. They are irreverent, inconsiderate and hostile to everyone around them including the priest. One of his parishioners even threatens to kill him. The only person who's actually any good is the widow who says of her deceased husband, ""Yes. He was a good man. We had a very good life together. We loved each other very much. And now... he has gone. And that is not unfair. That is just what happened. But many people don't live good lives. They don't feel love. That is why it's unfair. I feel sorry for them.""Father James is a dedicated and good priest, who upon the death of his wife, turned to religion and found out that priesthood was his 'calling'. Consequently, his daughter feels neglected and is severely depressed. He feels like he's letting everyone down because he thinks he has helped neither his parishioners nor his own daughter. This crisis of faith is quite similar to the one that all dedicated professionals feel, irrespective of their field of work. They find themselves fighting against everybody, at a great cost to their family life, to make a difference in a world that is unresponsive to all of their efforts.Fortunately for our protagonist, he finds success at one level. Through love and forgiveness, he patches things up with his daughter. His parishioners are a different matter altogether. And this is where he must decide:
How long will you last before you finally snap and give up?
And would the answer change if you were a priest?"
" And the point is ?
",0.0,-0.9605,2020-03-28 00:00:00,2,"Except for Brendan Gleeson who portrays a tired but patient priest, the movie is filled with nasty obnoxious people. Sat through this mess waiting for I don't know what. A total waste of time."
" one confused movie
",-0.3182,0.9397,2020-02-19 00:00:00,7,Yes confused. not confusing. director himself says that he does not have answer to anything and had no clear idea what it all meant. he knows that there are many thing that can be read wrong and he is OK with it. and it is the guy what wrote that the worst thing is having no integrity. usually i wouldn't give a movie so flawed 4 tops. but it did have a lot of good stuff. i just wish he would decided where he was going with that. and better made two movies one that dealt with serious side of it and other was just a dark comedy.
" Any Given Sunday
",0.0,-0.5772,2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Father James (Brendan Gleeson) is a Catholic priest in a small coastal village in Sligo, Ireland. He is threatened in the confession booth one day by a man he knows. The man was sexually abused by a priest as a youngster, and he tells Father James that Sunday week, he will murder James simply because he is a ""good priest""; what would be shocking about murdering a bad one? James meditates on this during the week and we follow him as he deals with his own inner demons with the arrival of his daughter to the village (he is a widower and joined the priesthood late in life) and tends to his flock, one of whom he knows to be the man who has threatened to murder him on the beach this coming Sunday.The second collaboration between John Michael McDonagh and Brendan Gleeson - the first film being 2011's ""The Guard"" - is a masterpiece in stage-style screenwriting and character development. The vast majority of scenes in this film are occupied by just two characters in conversation, one of whom invariably is Father James, an extremely likable and intelligent character expertly portrayed by Brendan Gleeson, in what I would call his career-defining performance. Just watch the scene between himself and Aiden Gillen - who plays the ""one part humanist, nine parts gallows-humour"" doctor, in the village local as the doctor recounts a horrific medical tale about a three year-end boy. It is such a well written and performed scene, and it is one of probably half a dozen that I could choose to mention. Aiden Gillen and Killian Scott make up two of the superb supporting cast who occupy this truly backward town. You would be hard pushed to find a more odd bunch of people. They each deliver their own unique oddities and perversions, with one thing in common; a blatant hostility for Father James. He gets it from all angles, but from observation you realise it is not at all personal. The villagers treatment of Father James in this film encapsulates a national sentiment in the wake of the horrendous child-abuse revelations carried out by the clergy in Ireland. Anything associated with the church became a source of resentment in this country about ten years ago in the wake of reports into the atrocities that were committed by agents of the Church. This, in my view, is what McDonagh was getting at with this film, and in doing so he captures the acrimony that a once Church-abiding nation now holds.Dark humour pervades the film. It is very funny, but at the same time it is all delivered with an undercurrent of dread. We feel the weight of the impending Sunday with Father James. We feel his anguish at the cruel slaying of his beloved dog Bruno. Again, this is back to Gleeson's superb performance. He is sharp with his difficult parishioners one minute, compassionate the next. Brawling and firing a pistol in another, then in a few scenes holding his heart out on a plate. A masterpiece for it's characters. Worthy of Oscars for it's performances. Watchable again and again for it's message of redemption and meditation on life."

" A really great character study and exploration about fate in the modern world.
",0.7425,0.8375,2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"Needless to say I loved Calvary, not only is every aspect of filmmaking completely on point, this film gives you some great ideas to chew on long after the credits have rolled.This film is a beautiful companion piece to 2018's First Reformed, they're almost a Yin and Yang of each other. First Reformed is more claustrophobic and dark while touching on themes of environmentalism, corporate influence in a capitalist society, and how extremism can infect a deeply religious person. Calvary has it's dark moments, but it's more colorful and has humor sprinkled throughout; While dealing with themes of faith in the modern world, depression, forgiveness, and resentment of the Catholic church.The basic plot is that Brendan Gleeson's character is threatened with death by an unknown member of his parish. He then speaks to each member of his parish to see if he can find out who wants to kill him. The plot is so much more than that, but that's the core. This film has some great character actors who chew the scenes they're in.I highly recommend this film and don't have any negative things to say. It's just brilliant."
" Father, forgive them
",0.2732,-0.9944,2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Written and Directed by John Michael McDonagh; this film goes a long way towards answering nagging questions that had been on my mind about everyday life in rural Ireland since I worked as a teenager with homeless expatriate Irishmen in Oxford. They seemed to know so much about me - who knew so little. I've tried to understand, for a long time, the nature of the communities they came from.In the film we see the main character Father James (Brendan Gleeson) as he goes about his work in the most challenging circumstances he's yet faced in his vocational life as a Roman Catholic priest.The time frame of the story is set early on in the film, when the local butcher Jack Brennan (Chris O'Dowd) makes a startling and disturbing disclosure in the confessional. He has lived (as so many sexually abused children do) with the awful secret for much of his adult life, to the extent that when he's ready and able to take on the Church and hold the individual concerned to account, he finds that he has died and his sins have effectively died with him.Like the girls, whose unplanned pregnancies led them to the Magdalene Laundries and left their children as abandonned orphans of the most unnecessary kind, Jack sees his options as few, and reasons that to find another offending priest and take his revenge on them would be less meaningful than to murder 'a good priest'. For want of a suitable alternative, Father James fits the bill and Jack gives him notice to get his affairs in order and meet him on the beach in a week's time.As Father James tries to get helpfully involved in the tragedies of his suicidal daughter Fiona (Kelly Reilly);a wealthy financier (Michael Fitzgerald) whose wealth and family seem meaningless to him; Jack Brenan's wayward wife Veronica (Orla O'Rouke); Inspector Stanton's theatrical, gay, young paramour Leo (Owen Sharpe); the bereaved wife (Marie-Josee Croze) of a dying road accident survivor to whom Father James administers the last rites and supportive counsel; a troubled young man, Milo (Killian Scott); an elderly American writer, living in a remote coastal cottage (M. Emmet Walsh) and fearing his own imminent death; a publican upon whom the banks have foreclosed which will destroy his livelihood.While he attends as best he can these troubles of other people within his orbit, his own world begins to cave in as his church is burned down and his dog is deliberately killed. He takes to drink and while drunk misuses the gun he has loaned from Inspector Stanton (Gary Lyndon) causing Brendan Lynch (Pat Shortt) even more pain and anguish - for which he retaliates with violence.Father James shows tremendous fortitude under all this pressure and having counselled his daughter that, among virtues 'forgiveness is under-rated' - keeps his appointment with Jack Brennan on the beach."

Its a twist on the classic 'whodunit' as you're left guessing who is going to do it!
Some characters are a little eccentric, the call boy for one, but all relatable through humor.
It was worth the watch, it might not seem it but the residents are a lot more reliant on their local priest (Brendan gleeson) than first thought, and in the end you can't help but feel for him massively. He doesn't think he's better than anyone else as a man of the church, but rather just wants to help."

Father James (Brendan Gleeson) hears the confession of a man who claims he was abused by a priest and he plans on killing Father James because he is a good priest. The film consists of James making his peace as he visits various members of his parish and community. James also tends to a suicidal daughter (Kelly Reilly). Father James claims he knows who told him this in the confessional, yet does nothing about it. As the audience we don't know and can only guess.The community in which Father James lives seem to consider him obsolete and a joke. The production is more of an examination of how society has changed with religion no longer the center of people's lives. Indeed, all the characters mock the church either openly or through their deeds. Dark comedy at times.Parental Guidance: F-bomb. sex, no nudity."

This is probably understood in the end by the victim, and the victim is not the dead one."

The priest is distraught and cries. The murderer at the end has the innocent priest in his gun sights and asks if the priest cried when his dog died. The priest answers, yes. The murderer asks if the priest cried when kids were being raped. No, the priest didnt cry, he was somehow detatched. Bang the first shot goes off to the priest's chest. The murderer is in rage: the priest cried for his dog yet not for the raped kids. Closeup: headshot with brains splattered everywhere. The murderer executes the priest. The christian church worldwide has much to answer for, how sexual assault was condoned, tollerated, protected for years. Yet this continues today. :-("
" Strangely compelling film

A man who was sexually abused as a child tells the priest in the confessional that priest is dead. Then states he didn't kill him, he wants ultimate revenge, to kill our innocent good priest, real payback in a way. But it then plays on that theme to show how Ireland, a highly Catholic country is changing. Lots of characters are introduced leading what the Church would once call immoral lives. They all in their own way ask who are you to preach morals to us after all the revelations that have happened. Very thought provoking, well acted, great scenic cinematography. It's no spoiler to say this reminded me in pace and ending of the classic Get Carter."
" Interesting, and very disturbing film. I found it one to admire the sentiment of rather than enjoy.
",0.6605,0.6661,2018-02-17 00:00:00,7,"I am trying hard to think why this film fails to be a great film, at least in my eyes. It seems to have the qualifications. It has a great cast, a powerful story, good direction and good pacing, and yet I feel strangely unenthusiastic about it. I am still unconvinced why it failed to make me like it more. I have only just watched it (half an hour ago) so maybe I am writing this review a little to soon to really guess at the answer to the above.Perhaps its the lack of subtlety in the film, which puts me off engaging with the characters. Maybe it is the strange lack of menace I had about the priest's (Brendan Gleeson) ultimate and very bloody fate. The acting by the way is fine throughout from most of the participants, except for a couple of the peripheal characters, which I found rather too quirky. Kelly Reilly however is very good as the priest's daughter, recovering from a suicide attempt; attempting to reconnect with her father. Chris O'Down is excellent at priest's unwarranted nemesis. Dylan Moran is good as he can be as an unsubtle and unsympathetic wealthy landowner. The beginning of the film does deliberately shock, where in confession an unseen and until the end unknown antagonist Chris O'Dowd, gives incredibly graphic detail about the sexual abuse he received, to the priest. I think this shocking start perhaps unbalances the film, and although the film does very well to live up to that start, it perhaps tries to hard throughout to keep that level of shock up. The ending however is genuinely gruesome, and deliberately provocative. I think it is there to try and make us reflect as society on the' indifference' people might have had to sexual abuse. The film overall also seems to make a point about how cynicism, greed and indifference allowed child abuse, by some of the priesthood in Ireland, to happen unhindered.I did find the ending moving especially when the daughter of the priest visits Chris O'Dowd in prison, presumably to accept his forgiveness. I do wish I liked this film more. It is brave, it is ambitious, and there is a who's who of Irish acting talent on display. Perhaps this film is just too pessimistic even allowing for the dark subject matter. You either have to like the characters, or its overall message, when a film is bleak in outlook. There are some lighter moments in the film especially with a fellow and incompetent priest, but there isn't much of it to go around in this film. Mind you the countryside is spectacularly brooding and beautiful. It is only a small compensation though to a well made but unfullfilling film."
" The story makes no sense, but it has cruelty and violence, so it must be »deep«.
",-0.9274,-0.9209,2018-01-14 00:00:00,1,"The movie is based on the same formula as American Beauty, but works in higher gear: most characters are obnoxious, detestable ; the story hardly makes any sense; we have violence, drugs, homosexuality, extremely morbid dialogues. The »deepest part« is the execution of an innocent man and splattered brains. This Irish movie also turns around the well known paedophilia in the Roman Catholic Church, presenting it in the most brutal way. It is interesting to look at the highly rated reviews: the titles often sound as advertisements. Calvary has not reached the rating of American Beauty though; the extra effort in nastiness did not pay off.If you are a normal man or woman, this movie will most probably ruin your day. I really do not understand the participating actors, who used their talent to make little bits and pieces more believable. Have they not read the whole script? 
Seriously, if you want to watch a good, touching film about child victims of sexual violence, see the South African movie Little One."

" Stereotypical Non-IRA Irish Film... Except--
",0.0,-0.3515,2017-10-10 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the most Christian films I have ever seen. The deepest questions about God and life in this fallen world are explored and often answered, but maybe the most important message of this work of art is the stress on forgiveness of others. When we forgive others of their failings, no matter how heinous, we release ourselves from the fear that we carried--the hatred--concerning them. The priest is brave, full of faith, and even heroic. He also understands that he has failings--he brings a loaded gun to the place where he is to meet the man who has threatened his life. When he gets there, though, and is facing the man, he overcomes his fear and never produces the weapon. Instead, until his death he implores the man to change and give his life to God and to the love of God. Some of the characters are quite rough around the edges, so this one isn't recommended for those who can't handle the reality of the way people typically live or even respond to priests, especially in an environment where Christianity is once again looked upon as being weird, mercenary, and/or unnecessary."
" Beyond Priesthood
",0.0,0.9761,2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"I found John Michael McDonagh's previous work The Guard (2011) lukewarm and trying to be funny more times than succeeding in my eye, even with some positive critics finding the humour to their liking. His recent War on Everyone (2016) has had rather poor critic and audience appreciation. I thus watched Calvary (2014) with some reservations, although I was hoping to find why there was more praise for Brendan Gleeson acting and McDonagh's writing and directing. It now seems that McDonagh may be much better with unconventional priests than with comic cops!From the unforgettable first line of the crisp script to the last shot of the film showing a single tear, the screenplay is pure genius. It is a dark comedy, a philosophical contemplation on life, pain, loss, forgiveness and frailty. The many characters and potent actors each add their own depth to the devoted priest centrepiece who is trying to help the community, but is also very aware of the reality and the limitations of his rhetoric. I have rarely seen a movie about a religious figure be so morally ambiguous, subdued yet ambitious. IT is not preachy or propose any universal truth, but rather explores humanity as is, raw, flawed and in search for: pleasure, closure, redemption, revenge, reparation, meaning, happiness, communication and communion. Communion as in deeply sharing and beyond the Christian shenanigans of the body of Christ. The priest who sees himself as inherently trying to do ""good"", and not only God's work, is an endearing character how is as flawed as all the others. He drinks, swears, gets violent on occasion, exhibits greed and has done some harm, somewhat inadvertently, to his suicidal daughter. Yet, he is real and relatable. He questions the moral compass he holds himself up to and tries to be the pillar of his town and community. He sometimes fails, but gets up and tries to do better.He says there is ""too much focus on sins and less on virtues"". He finds a way to teach his daughter true forgiveness and love. The film is ultimately beautifully filmed, acted, directed and edited and is based on a off-beat, cynical, but surprisingly smart and sensible screenplay that delivers laughs, emotions and life reflections. Bravo Mr. McDonagh. You hit the nail... to the cross."

" Who will rid me of this troublesome priest?

He is certainly troubled;a late - comer to the priesthood after the death of his wife he is left to carry the guilt of the Catholic Church for decades of appalling abuse and cover - ups. He has an assistant - rather like Father Dougal but less bright. Through a querulous sort of faith he manages to keep ahead of the many demons chasing him until he more or less commits suicide by confronting a crazed survivor of institutional child abuse and lets him do his worst - which is pretty damned bad. This man's philosophy is ""There are no friends - just enemies you haven't met yet"".It seems to be one shared by all the inhabitants of his village,each of whom seems poised to do violence to the unfortunate father. ""Calvary"" is offered as a comedy.You can believe that or not as it pleases you. I have laughed more at a visit to the abattoir. But it is an impressive work,unfailingly cynical in it's approach to the ""humanity"" of humanity. It is full of excellent performances and contains a touching cameo by Mr M.Emmett Walsh as a dying writer that as far as I can tell has no relevance to the story but he is so good it doesn't matter. Mre B.Gleeson and Mr J.O'Dowd are outstanding as the protagonists in the battle between good and evil.Who represents which is up the the individual viewer to decide. ""There is just enough religion in the world to make men hate each other but not enough to make them love each other"". I say ""Amen"" to that.And so,I'm pretty sure,would Father James."
" Thoughtful but elusive
",0.2023,0.6709,2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"In John McDonagh's film 'Calvery', a priest is threatened by a parishioner, who announces his intention to kill him a week hence. We then see the priest having mostly one-to-one conversations with his troubled (and troublesome) flock; he knows which one wants to kill him (for the crimes of the church in general, not for his personal sins), but we do not. The setting is a somewhat archetypal west-coast Irish village. What's good about the film is its portrayal of a man clearly sincerely motivated by his belief and his sense of duty, nonetheless wrestling with a profound crisis of self-interest. That said, the story is contrived, almost deliberately stylised; I liked it, but the point remains elusive."
" Not just bad-insulting
",0.0,-0.9606,2017-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Just saw this film on BBC iplayer as it had been recommended to me and had a pretty decent set of reviews and score on IMDb. I couldn't have been more led astray. There are different kinds of bad film; the one so bad its funny; the one that's just cheap and boring; the bang bang forget about the plot; the pretentious star vehicle; but this is the worst kind; the insult to the topic and the viewer. There is no way this film could have been good; it simply is a pile of half-digested thoughts thrown together without any feel for context or reference. There is a priest, apparently he is a widower with a daughter(possible but most unlikely) He has long hair and a beard(possible but unlikely) He is a parish priest but there is no community except a bunch of Oirish stereotypes. The local chief cop is an out gay man hanging around with a screaming queen. The priest has been threatened by an abused parishioner, whom he knows but for some reason chooses not to confront or report. He has a daughter who is English and apparently prone to suicide attempts,and who has a cheap wig. His colleague priest is an idiot who seems to have wandered in from a cheap sitcom. Throw in Chris O'Dowd as the local butcher and would be assassin. He can't act but IS funny in a comedy. Likewise Dylan Moran, who is also funny but can't act as a depressed financier. So we have sexual abuse by priests, the failure of the Celtic Tiger and its aftermath, a deep malaise in the country at large, and yet not a single conversation rings true. Everyone just mouths vague platitudes and homespun faux- philosophy. The characterisation is paper-thin and disjointed. Nothing that happens here would ever happen. This film won awards! It is a pile of complete garbage and the makers should be tarred and feathered and dragged down every main street in Ireland."
" A touching and thoughtful film
",0.3818,0.9342,2017-05-07 00:00:00,9,"Calvary = 2: an experience of usually intense mental suffering.Calvary is one of those films that will stay with you long after you've watched, because of how it starts, how it develops, how it ends, and how it is performed. The title really fits the story, because the main character, Fr James, will live a sort of Christ's Calvary before being killed just for being a good man. This is a sad story, that touched me deeply because it starts with a very thoughtful approach to pastoral care, the goodness of people, helping those in need, troubled souls who seek counsel and those who don't. Yet, the more the time passes the more despair and wickedness settle in. Fr James' flock is mostly of black sheep, who don't give a damn about the only man on whom they vomit their crap, hurt on purpose, use and abuse him. No matter how much he cares, no matter how much the good he does, he founds scorn, disrespect, passive aggression, and threats. We see this good character taking so much, and having nobody to care for him, to help him with the load. We go from hope to despair, and that is never easy to watch. The film also touches on very sensitive issues like child abuse by the Catholic church, and it does so in a very provoking way, the final dialogues in the film are really brilliant despite how horrendous the end is. The dialogues are brilliant, meaningful and powerful. From death, the afterlife, happiness and euthanasia, family connections, the state of the soul, cheating, and so on. This film relies heavily on the acting. No gimmicks. I thought all actors were great and believable in their respective roles, and they were very good together. However, the film heavily relies on we believing that Brendan Glesson is the good but tormented Fr James, and I did believe it. The impacting ending, to me, was mostly because I was watching Fr James's drama unfold, not an actor playing Fr James's drama. Gleeson deserved a nomination for his performance, really. I'm a fan of Chris O'Dowd; he has an amazing acting register from hilarious comedian to dramatic roles like the one he plays here. The film is beautifully shot in a remote rural area of Western Ireland and has a lovely soundtrack and cinematography. My only criticism to the film is that we don't get to understand why most of the villagers are so wicked, so cynic, so sarcastic, so rotten, arrogant, and careless. We witness the social dynamics of the group, but we don't understand most of the individuals. Yet, we do understand Fr James, and his faith, his innate goodness. They don't make movies like this in Hollywood."
" Title is misleading
",-0.4019,0.8675,2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"The title and the explanation of the film are very misleading. I thought maybe it was more about the supernatural or even something more sinister. Instead it was a highly entertaining and serious movie that I couldn't stop watching. Brendan Gleeson is really under rated as an Actor but this movie allows him to shine, along with all of those around him. What a great ""sleeper"" movie. You'll be very glad you took the time to watch it."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9652,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"With such a stellar cast, I expected better, but it was as if someone came up with the idea of putting a bunch of well-known Irish actors together, throw in a couple of Americans to keep them happy, and create two-dimensional unlikable characters around a Catholic priest, but who add nothing meaningful to the story. I didn't see the point of the movie at all and felt I'd wasted my time. *spoiler* A man threatens to kill the priest, burns down the church, then kills the priest. *end spoiler* Yes, it was about child abuse by members of the Catholic church, but this movie contributed nothing at all to the debate - *spoiler* a nutter kills a good priest *end spoiler*. And if it was supposed to be a surprise at who had threatened him, it wasn't. I knew the voice of the actor right at the beginning."
" An Intriguing Concept that Quickly Divulges to 'A Day in the Life of a Priest'
",0.0,-0.9716,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Calvary follows a priest who, while in a confession box, has his life threatened, and how his week goes leading up to the day he's supposed to be murdered. The concept alone was enough to get be hooked, and I must say that I was looking forward to this movie. I wondered how it would handle itself, and was hugely let down. The second the opening scene is completed, it becomes 'a day in the life of a local priest'. Father James, the main priest, wanders about doing odd jobs for people, taking care of his routine, talking to people about things that don't really matter in ways that never gave the audience any reason to care about anything that was going on. Sure, it gets more intense towards the end, but that was over an hour of odd jobs and boring dialogue. The movie's pacing is very dull. It presents an engaging concept, gives the audience a good opening scene, then relies on that steam to carry it for over an hour. While I never necessarily felt compelled to just take a nap, I found myself consistently checking the remaining run time, realizing that I was only halfway and still had the same amount of time left. It was more tedious than it was boring. I just wanted to skip to the end, but persisted anyway. That's not to say that this movie did nothing right. The second half is vastly more interesting than the first half. The characters are, at this point, grounded, and some of them become interesting. Most of them are just mindless stereotypes who claim to be more than that, yet refuse to be any more. We have a black man who accuses people of being racist, then embodies his stereotype to a haunting level. There's the cheating wife who acts exactly how'd you'd expect her to. She cheats on her husband, and that's it. The most intriguing character of all was Fitzgerald, someone who actually had depth and purpose in the end. He was the only character who actually had something going on to make him worth seeing through to the end, save for Father James of course. Furthermore, all the performances are fairly competent. Brendan Gleeson and Dylan Moran, again the two most interesting characters, were pretty good, and Kelly Reilly was good as well. They did what they needed for their characters, and made it just that much more bearable to sit through. The whole revelation at the end when the audience learns who made the threat was, while unexpected, nonsensical in reality. There wasn't any real reason for this specific character to want to kill a priest, despite how much thinking I did about the matter. I just really didn't get it. None of the characters actually seem like they would want to kill a priest, or anyone for that matter, save for maybe one. But it's doubtful in my mind even he would want to kill a priest. Overall Calvary is a tedious drag, but it has some redeeming qualities including some payoff at the end and about two engaging characters. As much as I want to see it again with a new mindset, I also don't want to have to risk being bored out of my mind again. In the end I would recommend this movie so long as you go in with the right mindset."
