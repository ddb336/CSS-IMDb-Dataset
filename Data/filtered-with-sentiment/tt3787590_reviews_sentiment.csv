" We Are Your Friends
",0.4767,-0.2023,2021-01-25 00:00:00,5,5/10 - empty and lifeless take on the LA dance music/DJ scene leaves so much on the table
" Real life

" Great on replay
",0.6249,0.9403,2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,Good music and a fun movie. If movies with good music is something you like this is a great movie to watch.
" I loved the music
",0.5994,0.9153,2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,Music is amazing. Some holes in the story and an annoying female lead; but the story is pretty good and the music is fantastic . Makes me think back to the easier days of no fentanyl fears
" Better than they say
",0.4404,0.9792,2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie even if it's a bit shallow and disjointed. ""We Are Your Friends"" is about an aspiring DJ who is looking for his big chance, all while navigating the tumultuous lifestyle of pursuing your dreams in LA. This movie is a bit of a coming "" into"" age film but its also a romantic drama, a music film, and a rowdy tale of good friendships... All in one, lol. The director was clearly unsure of his direction as many scenes seem out of place. The vibe is uneven, and there is no flow at all. There are sequences of greatness but it almost comes off as a collection of scenes from a film that could have been much better. Still, though, this movie still has a spark and it resonated nicely with me. I can relate in many ways to Cole and his story is actually kind of compelling. I was intrigued enough to keep wanting to see what comes next. How much worse can it get? When is the point of redemption? This movie would be good for a young man between the ages of 18 and 25 to watch as they may learn a thing or two from it."
" Popcorn Movie
",0.0,0.8692,2020-05-19 00:00:00,6,"It's enjoyable party movie but that's it. It's empty inside and don't have a strong plot but it have good scenes in it. I feel like good quality YouTube compilation when I watched it.Not bad, if you have free time, won't bore you."
" one good scene
",0.4404,0.7708,2020-04-13 00:00:00,5,"When Zac takes the PCP at the art party... and then wakes up.
cool animation, looked really good with the music.
its a shame this idea wasnt revisited.
the scene where they're being trained to do ""real estate"" had a smart alecky feel to it... completely out of place right after the pcp scene.
its like the director got scared of the his most interesting ideas."
" Excellent to watch
",0.5719,0.765,2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Perfect movie for a quarantine Friday night at 12am , good vibes"
" Only for an LA Lifestyle audience
",0.0,0.9042,2020-03-30 00:00:00,4,"If you read the the back of the VHS box prior to viewing then you can expect everything you got. This is a movie for a particular audience and it works great for them. If you're a dairy farmer from Wisconsin then you might want to ask Blockbuster for a refund. Zac and Emily have good chemistry and Efron's childhood buddies add an extra layer of script to the movie. That being said, if you're into the LA club scene this is your movie and if you're not keep scrolling on Netflix maybe watch Trains Planes and Automobiles for the 16th time."
" What?
",0.0,0.7984,2020-02-15 00:00:00,4,"This movie is almost making fun of this scene. First off, horrible music. That's not house music nor should it even represent any kind of electronic music. This party scene is also embarrassing. Some rich, LA kids partying and listening to horrible music acting like zac efrons character was a good person. So cheesy. I definitely lost some brain cells watching this movie"
" Give it a shot
",0.0,0.5647,2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Way better than you would expect. Amazing acting by a lower budget cast, but still a solid movie"
" I thought it was such a good movie, especially how I use to be in the club scene!
",0.4926,0.9986,2019-11-11 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why anyone would give this bad reviews, unless they don't understand the club rat life! This was my whole 20s bartenders, promoters, music, festivals, djs. I just love Zac Efron's acting and how he wants to be a famous DJ and he has the talent. But he also has to make money in the real world. I use to love working in clubs but you do eventually have to get a real job as well. I also love the romance story. I mean this girl was so glamorous In the beginning, living and getting taken care of by a rich Dj. Then when he she's has enough of his drinking and cheating. She ends up just a regular girl waitressing and going back to school. That's also a big thing in club life, the constant drinking and doing drugs! It's not appealing to date or live that life on every day basis. It's fantasy but it's a fantastic world to be in at the same time! I loved the ending how he mixed that whole set up at the festival. It was really amazing. I love the 3 friends who Cole gets confused and starts bailing on them a lot for the girl and the famous Dj. Until one of good friends dies he finally gets the courage to make something and do great at the festival and to the women who was losing her house! It really is a fantastic movie based on what club life is really like and how not everyone can be a Dj. You have to have talent."
" Its typical and a little bit slow
",0.0,0.6761,2019-09-26 00:00:00,4,"Now I love party scene films such as Project X or, for those who like Zac Efron, films such as Bad Neighbours or That Awkward Moment. I sort of hoped that this film followed suit considering Zac Efron previous and similar roles, however the film is like D grade, a good attempt and very close, but ultimately still a fail. By all means watch it if you want but I know there's better films out there that'll hit at least a pass."
" Sigh.
",0.0258,0.9026,2019-09-04 00:00:00,2,"I could put a well thought out review about the acting and the production value and everything that goes in to a movie and it's subsequent review. Instead, since I've already wasted so much of my time and energy due to this movie, I'm going to keep it short and simple:The story was weird. It wasn't exactly good or interesting but it wasn't bad. It was under the umbrella of ""whatever"". Nothing all that interesting happened. I didn't root for any of the characters, I was more emotionally invested in my popcorn than I was in this movie. I can barely remember scenes because they were so dragged out and, by the way, if you hate EDM and House and whatever this music is called, you're going to wish this movie was never put in front of your eyes and ears.I implore you to read reviews and think about this before allowing this to take up time in your life. Please. It's so bad."
" Wow
",0.5859,0.8038,2019-08-31 00:00:00,10,Simply WOW. If you've ever been to a rave or had half of an experience in life this movie is definitely for you
" Stupid kids
",-0.5267,0.8416,2019-08-19 00:00:00,4,"Watched this for Zac Efron, expected better. But funny surprise, Shane from TWD is in everything!!"
" Another Hollywood film
",0.0,0.0772,2019-08-14 00:00:00,4,I understanding living in the valley sucks and making it in Hollywood is very hard what I don't understand is why film makers think anyone really care outside LA.
" I just like it...fun movie
",0.3612,0.7482,2019-07-24 00:00:00,9,"Seen it several times, if you like Trap music, mix... You'll like this.
Enjoyable!"
" Surprisingly good film
",0.6249,0.97,2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,I had a really hard time getting into this movie at first cause off all the swearing and the characteristic of actors that just played giant American cliche pricks that we see in almost every movie coming from The United States of America these day. But the more I got into the movie the more the characters got fleshed out and the more I cared about them. If you watch this movie then give it a chance cause it will get better in time. We are our friends is simply worth just hang in there my friends.
" Inspiring, great story line and edits
",0.7845,0.9676,2019-05-28 00:00:00,7,"Even though im not an EDM fan I truly enjoyed the songs. It was definitely inspiring and it is definitely inspiring for the people who wants to become someone. Casting was amazing and everybody has done a great work. I liked the directing even though it seems like the director did not have a great experience in directing. The songs and editing of the movie was great, it makes to flow of the movie really great and it keeps the movie fun. It has unexpected events in it that I did not expect at all. The movie could have achieved a lot better but its a great movie to watch in your free time if you enjoy similar stories and music.
More detailed on review on certain events in the movie:The plot after the death of their friends seems kind of rushed and the people seemed to get over it real quick, even though that the title is literally ""We Are Your Friends"". There should have been more scenes on their loss of their friends.Also I am not sure if it was the best ending or not because in the final sceneeven though we know that the protagonist achieves his dreams and becomes successful we still want to know and see more about it. So whats next? I feel like there could have been more scenes on his future and his success.Lastly, the character build up of the protagonists friends was too weak. The death did not even exactly ""touch us"", the sadness or fights in the group did not affect the watcher that much because the character build up was too weak. We did not care about the other characters because we did not know much about them which made the death scene, fight and discussion scenes so weak."
" Don't Listen to the Hate
",-0.5719,0.9907,2019-04-17 00:00:00,7,"A good, fresh movie, obviously geared towards younger generations with a mostly unknown cast and more than competent direction. There are some great sequences in here, with great visuals and graphics, very visually appealing and even informative.The storyline admittedly is very predictable, and the script is nothing out of this world, however it's fun and realistic, and you feel as though you really meet these characters. What it misses is focus, as the story has 2 different storylines, the one about Cole as a DJ being much stronger, and maybe it would have profited for cutting down on the scenes with friends. Although there are some gems there, it's been done many times before and the ending of that storyline is very predictable.Now although this was never going to get any Oscars, it's still a good and entertaining tale of coming of age tale, and what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with a great soundtrack and pure heart coupled with a great performance by Efron.P.S. The quotes from the movie might be laughable to some, but as a late stage millennial, I feel that quotes like ""are we ever gonna be better than this?"" and ""This is the best part. The best part of anything really. It's the moment before it starts."" are as real and contemporary as they get"
" The Social Network
",0.0,0.9464,2019-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Sometimes, your head tells you that a film is mediocre at best, not one that is going to spark off a debate or be in the critical argument for the near future. Sometimes, your heart tells you that despite that, you are enjoying the film on some level - and whilst I hate to use the phrase 'switch your brain off entertainment', I just did. It might be the well-curated soundtrack, appropriate for the story of a young group of friends and the central characters DJ aspirations. It might be the often-likeable Zac Efron as Cole, whose slightly lower key Star Is Born trajectory is complicated by romantic entanglements and that aforementioned group of friends. It might even be the predictable plotting - spiked with occasional off-kilter moments such as a memorable art gallery trip. Whatever magic makes We Are Your Friends work for me is not easily explainable - so hopefully it'll be seen by a few more people who might be able to enlighten me as to why I keep watching it."
" I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this
",0.8074,0.8503,2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"I kept scrolling past this on Netflix thinking it wouldn't be worth my time, but I actually really enjoyed it. It has authenticity, genuineness and explores questions we all ask ourselves at one time or another. It's emotionally relatable. I liked it."
" Pre party hype up
",0.4019,0.9093,2018-12-23 00:00:00,5,If you want to get hyped to go to a music festival then a def watch!!!!! Other then that pretty decent movie plot more fun than anything.
" Good
",0.4404,0.7495,2018-11-27 00:00:00,9,"This film deserves a higher score! I really enjoyed it and would recommend it, probably written for a late teen / early twenties audience"
" life as a DJ
",0.0,0.9166,2018-11-21 00:00:00,9,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you what people are willing to do for fame. The direction is really good and so is the screenplay. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Starts like a flat, cheesy movie, ends like a BANG!!!
",0.7074,0.9607,2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Ignore the ratings, bad reviews, just go and watch it. This movie will seem to have a flat, cheesy lineup at the start, which tells the story of some arrogant dudes but at the end this movie will effect you with mixture of love, comeback, music and friendship. Such a great movie with cool actors like Zac & Emily."
" TUNE
",0.0,0.7783,2018-08-25 00:00:00,10,Great film. Gets u in the mood to go out and party
" Fame, Excess, and Friendship
",0.7003,0.9917,2018-06-04 00:00:00,7,"This was an interesting movie. A young guy (Zac Efron) dreams of making it big as an EDM DJ. It gets into the whole DJ scene, process of mixing the music, party scene, fame, drugs, etc. It was pretty interesting because I think it did a great job of creating that environment and the atmosphere of it.The acting was good too and it had some good themes in there about friendship and taking things to excess. There's a bit of a romance too. Great soundtrack. Not like every other movie that's out there. Overall, pretty good!"
" Inspiring
",0.4215,0.9709,2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie make me feel really great. I really like Zac play in this movie (not only in this) and of course the gorgeous Emily. Nice musics, motivating story. I will watch it again for sure!"
" Electrifying
",0.0,0.9781,2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I like the fact that Zac is an ever evolving character that knows how to deal with any kind of movie he gets the chance to play in. He takes me by surprise every time I see him acting and in this movie he showed us again that he got the skills to keep the viewers enjoyed with the story the movie had to share. It's a really true fact that nowadays electronic music festivals ""take over"" the world and spread happiness all around, and I'm glad that movies like these are made in order to make all of us conscious that this is the ""lit"" thing of the moment and it only takes a song to connect hundreds of thousands of souls, if not millions."
" Cliché story works in brief parts
",0.0,0.9966,2017-07-12 00:00:00,5,"We Are Your Friends sees Zac Efron as Cole Carter, an aspiring DJ looking to make inroads into the EDM scene. He spends his days hanging with his closest friends: aspiring actor Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez), aspiring club owner Mason (Jonny Weston), and aspiring- want to be better in life nerd Squirrel (Alex Shaffer). To make some much- needed money for their dreams, the guys get jobs working for a shady businessman, Paige (Jon Bernthal), who takes advantage of people whose houses are in foreclosure. Cole finally gets his music break when an older, more established DJ named James (Wes Bentley) The film has some good moments but is dragged down with the subplot of the real estate job they get into, as well as scenes involving Cole and his friends. We see in many coming of age films like this where the main star is associated with low-life characters as friends and wonder why they're friends but there's a friendship due to growing up or spending much time with one another. It is a very cliché and predictable story, which has been done before but in some parts it works and is quite enjoyable. The clichés come from an aspiring person wanted to become rich, there becomes trouble, a love interest comes in between the lead and his mentor, but in the end we all know a fairly happy ending occurs.The best parts of the film, although may be cliché are with the trio of Cole, James Weed and Sophie, and these scenes have more meaning than the ones involving Cole and his friends. The cast works, lead by Zac Efron and Wes Bentley. This film is decent but it doesn't fully captivate the way it could have. It was clear at points they made it have come deep depressing scenes to make use feel more for the characters but in the end, it really wasn't as much. ""Are we ever going to be better than this?""- An important quote said in the later parts of the film.This film is reported to have had a low budget of $2 and made $11 million worldwide, but is considered a box office flop,mainly due to it's low opening weekend and a disappointment considered Zac Efron is a big name star. This should have done bigger numbers. Marketing is definitely a factor as it was poorly marketed in some areas. Perhaps ""We Are Your Friends"" becomes some type of cult classic in the future, but we doubt it."
" About an aspiring DJ and his friends circle.
",0.4767,0.9108,2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I've never seen any actor worse than Zac, yet he keeps making films. That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.Too slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. Yeah, there's no rhythm. All we have seen a DJ while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. Directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay. Some people might like the film, but not for me. This is completely an ignorable film.4/10"
" Pushes the buttons
",0.0,0.9349,2017-05-25 00:00:00,4,"Cole Carter (Zac Efron) is a part time DJ who work on parties with his group of friends. By day they make money by working for a real estate hustler.Cole encounters a once legendary DJ, James Reed (Wes Bentley.) They share a joint, passion for dance music and Reed gets Cole some gigs. Cole also falls for Reeds girlfriend.The best thing about the film is Cole explaining the basics of being a DJ and how to get a crowd to move at a dance party. The worse thing about the movie is the clichéd story. Also making electronic dance music on screen memorable is rather difficult when it is music that you are meant to dance to.Still Efron gives a bright performance."
" one of the best EDM films out there !!
",0.6988,0.9898,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"I get it, a lot of people do not understand EDM and primarily this is the reason a lot of critics and viewers castrated this film. I am by no means a zac efron's fan but the guy here acted his heart out. emily ratajkowski also brings out her acting chops. The cinematography depicting the valley atmosphere is on point, it brings a raw,getting up in the morning feel to the film. The music what can i say comprises some of the best EDM tracks out there, from ""The rapture - sister saviour(DFA mix) to the ending track ""Cole memories"" are just amazing. The film on its own is worth watching just to lend an ear to the wonderful music it contains. There is also a coming of age story which is not Oscar-worthy but still warm and fuzzy. If you love EDM and feel good films then this is one film you should not miss out on. P.S. The party animated scene is targeted at those who have experienced hallucination while under the influence."
" An exciting and fantastic portrayal of a DJ's life
",0.7783,0.9788,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"We are your friends is personally one of my favourite films. Its extremely engaging and connects with the viewer in many various ways throughout. Its got everything: drugs, women, sex, violence, and partying. Its a feel good movie and also sad and serious at times. It has everything for me, not to mention the utter beauty of Emily Ratajkowski. Thorughout the film it makes you just want to get up and dance with Zac and the whole group. I do not see a single floor in the acting and even though its not the best it certainly does the job. It is such a fantastic film and i highly recommend it ti anyone who; loves beautiful women who make your heart melt, crazy parties and well anything that's fun. Watch this film!!!"
