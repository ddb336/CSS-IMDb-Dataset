" What could've been.
",0.0,0.8845,2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,I only rate this 10 because I don't feel it deserves such a low score. Mainly all the action is practical and stunt work and it shows some of the best stunts ever put to film just such a shame there isn't much else. I wish there was 30 minutes added scenes fleshing out some of the characters giving Ray Winston more screen time and more to do more scenes of the love interest making her more relatable also more dramatic scenes between Bodhi and Utah and showing him conflicted. I really feel if there was a directors cut with 30 more minutes of story it would been up there as one of the best action movies of the last decade. What we got is still worth a watch for the stunts alone.

" Amazing breathtaking strunts
",0.7783,0.9348,2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,I recently watched this movie (Feb 2021) and have only a vague recollection of the original film. I really enjoyed this popcorn movie and the stunts are spectacular which are filmed in the most stunning locations. I have no idea how they filmed these stunts without killing people!. Film was is worth repeat watching to please give it a chance.
" Empty
",-0.2023,0.6131,2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,"I gave it a try, but after 20 minutes I already didn't care for this.
This shouldn't be called a remake and it is a shame to the original. Don't waste your time, like I did.
This is empty and lacks everything the original did have.
Just a few stars for some well done cinematography and stunts. But it doesn't carry the movie all the way.

" Amazing action scenes and horribly bad plot.
",-0.4767,-0.0163,2020-12-31 00:00:00,3,"The 2015's version of Point Break has some awesome action scenes and a beautiful scenario. The landscapes are really breathtaking and beautifully recorded most of the time.And that's it.The plot is just terrible. Horrible. Pathetic. It doesn't have any outstanding moment to be described here. It was a waste of time watching.The plot would've taken a 1/10 as score, and the cinematography, as I said above, an 8/10. Since I was watching a movie and not the X-Games or a Discovery documentary about landscapes, the final score is a 3/10."
" Have we watch the same movie?
",0.0,0.9001,2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"There are a lot of angry Point Break 1991 fans around and that was the one bad thing this film did. Try to picture this as a stand-alone movie, and you'll learn to enjoy it. Besides the nice action sequences and incredible visuals, this film has a legit point that it's trying to make ""You can only be responsible for your own actions, not others"" which is pretty great.
Personally, I've watched this movie at least 10 times and still enjoy it every time."
" Everything wrong
",-0.4767,-0.7579,2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"A bad attempt of remake, wrong time for using X-Sports, half of the movie is gorgeous photography, non-plausible characters, poor dialogue. The same premise was used by Fast and Furious 10 times better."
" This movie is one of my favorite movies.
",0.4588,0.7502,2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,"I've seen both movies. Not many people can relate extreme sports. can relate, near death experiences away at you until they happen again. Acting well you don't have the named people as in first. Yet the wonderful shots and earthly naturist Views are great. Save our planet, is that what people want Don't listen to the bad reviews I didn't think they would be able to Jam every ""extreme sport"" into such a small amount of time, and accomplished it, not an easy task. Difficult even when no plot or sense of story gets in the way. That I commented Because the teacher gave the work hahaha."
" One of the best remakes out there!
",0.6696,0.9991,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"By no means is this as good as the original, not even close for me. But I gotta be honest I really enjoyed this remake.Johnny Utah (played this time by Luke Bracey) formerly an ""Extreme Sport Athlete"" is now a new FBI agent. He is assigned a case involving extreme sport robbers doing crazy heists around the world. The FBI boss this time is played by Delroy Lindo. Utah declares that the robbers seem to be doing the Ozaki 8, which is eight extreme ordeals that honors the forces of nature. Like the original Utah must work with Pappas (now played by Ray Winstone) to uncover the case. They go to a surfing party in France where Utah almost drowns when surfing a gigantic wave, but is saved by Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez), Utah being undercover of course requests to join Bodhi's crew, Utah also meets Samsara (Teresa Palmer) who he of course falls in love with. I'm not gonna spoil the whole film but last thing I'll say is that there's a bunch of extreme sports scenes that are awesome to watch.First off again there was no way they were gonna capture the original, the original is a favorite of mine and I knew going in it wasn't going to come close. This remake actually has a lot of differences to the original. There a lot of extreme sports scenes that are nowhere present in the original which I appreciate that director Ericson Core and writer Kurt Wimmer tried some stuff original to their version so to speak. Another difference I really liked was that Utah was already an adrenaline junkie before whereas in the 1991 film he had to learn to do these things, here he's already somewhat familiar as we see in the opening of the movie. Also Utah in this iteration seems more like a tortured man which I thought was a great difference. The cast does a fine job, Luke and Edgar give good performances as Utah and Bodhi, granted they wouldn't be my first picks for the respective parts but for what they had to do they did a fine job. Ray Winstone was really good as Pappas I thought, I wish he had more screen time but it is what it is. Lastly I want to highlight Teresa Palmer as Samsara, her character is completely different then Lori Petty's character in the original, Teresa did a great job considering she had just given birth at the time of filming. The cinematography was once again fantastic and Core actually did it himself which I thought was cool. The soundtrack was also really good, great songs by Andrew Watt and Dig the Kid. Overall I really liked this remake and I don't get why it's so universally hated, it ain't that bad at least to me."
" Excellent cinematography-fun remake!
",0.6114,0.9811,2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"This is a nice remake of the original film with Keanu Reeves. What to expect: great action sequences and extreme sports (moto-cross, rock-climbing, surf and many other). I very much enjoyed the novelty in the adaptation of the old story to the new one. The connection between the characters is a bit better than the one in the old movie; at least it is more clear to see.
If you like action and movies with extreme sports and great stunts, then this is going to be a ride. Don't expect much more than that though...acting is average and the story, yep you know it, already. Nevertheless, this recommended for the fans! 8/10"
" Worst Film I've Ever Seen
",-0.6249,-0.966,2020-10-10 00:00:00,1,"WARNING! Do not watch this film! Some films are so bad they're funny. This film is just BAD!The script feels like it was written by teenagers. Bad plot, worse dialogue. I hate this film so much. Over-tattooed, mountain dew, pretentious, too-cool-for-school, insanely dumb millennials following some pseudo-hippy eco-spirituality.Ugly, dated 2011 EDM aesthetic. Watching this film was like nails on a chalkboard.UNBELIEVABLY BAD!"
" Nice action but dull story
",-0.3919,-0.7469,2020-09-28 00:00:00,3,"Action sports were amazing as well as filming.The acting was terrible. The script was just as bad. Bland Dopey and desperate acting. This script may have been written by someone just out of film school.The viewer is never engaged in any meaningful manner to care what the characters are chasing. So when a character dies, your reaction is, ""oh well, which guy was that again?? Meh, never mind.""At the scene were Utah and Bodhi were staring each other down across from train tracks, Utah jumps in to chase him and a train whizzes by in front of him. Ummm... trains are pretty loud and especially passing by passenger platforms.And if you surf, you'll see them mix up the breaks. Jaws, Teahupoo, to label them ""Cortez Bank."" Uh, no. Teahupoo is such a signature break, you can't pass that off as Cortez Banks.Overall, I was alert for the action sports but was bored with the dialogue and story.Oh the sound was annoying. The speech volume was so low and the effects were so loud. So when you're watching it and have the speech just right, the effects come in and it's just over the top loud in relation to the voices."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,0.7862,2020-09-10 00:00:00,3,"Just horrible. The beginning action sequence was very entertaining. It all went downhill. Even stayed until the second action sequence. Not worth it. Should have stayed with the surfer aspect, and not made it such a huge movie. Smaller more local stuff would have been nice like the original movie.Don't recommend3 stars"
" Garbage

" Pointless Break
",0.0,0.34,2020-08-19 00:00:00,1,Why oh why make a re-make of a movie which was brilliant with Swayze and Reeves.. same story line but acting was terrible.. this movie should be deleted from history...
" Impressively Soulless
",0.4588,0.9949,2020-07-05 00:00:00,1,"It's one thing to make a soulless movie, it's another to do so in a remake of a movie that was so FULL of soul - it almost seems intentional. The Ex-Presidents in the original really felt like a tight-knit brotherhood; in the remake, they appear to have decided that simply slapping some tattoos and scars on the characters and having them hold hands around a picnic table, hug each other a few times and fortune cookie-philosophize is enough to paint that bond. It isn't. Ramirez had a hard act to follow with Swayze's original Bodhi (one of my favourite movie characters and Swayze roles) and was never really given a chance with such a weak script. As a screen presence he had some of Swayze's zen vibe, but again it is as if the writers and director intentionally sucked all the soul out of his character by giving him nothing to work with. The whole eco-warrior thing really didn't work either; you care more about the Ex-Presidents who were simply about not being part of the system, following the waves and stealing to fund their travels than the tree-hugging crew who aren't in it for the money in the remake. The one way that the remake could have improved on the original was to cast the lead with an actor who can actually act, Keanu Reeves standing out in the original as his usual wooden, cardboard cut-out of a character, Ted Theodore Logan packing an FBI badge this time. But...no. They cast THAT guy, I don't even recall his name, another lifeless cut-out with acceptable surf-hair being sufficient, I guess. With a decent Johnny Utah this time round you could at least say they did THAT right, but again, it is almost as if they wanted to miss on every level. Ray Winstone is a great actor, but yet again, he was given nothing to work with, whereas Busey's Pappas was a larger-than-life character who actually had a role to play, not just there as the cut-out's ride. Lori Petty was the love interest in the original and had a fleshed-out character that you gave a damn about, whereas, yet again, Teresa Palmer was given a character who simply spouted a few hippy-dippy lines and was thrown in to simply look good in a swimsuit. John C. McGinley was fantastic as the FBI chief in the original and despite having less lines, stood out far more than Delroy Lindo's version. It actually hurt me to see James LeGros cameo in this remake because it was a physical connection to the original - there should be no connection at all, this is an insult to the original. Hot Fuzz pays proper tribute to the original and its homage to Utah emptying his gun into the air as he lets Bodhi escape garners the appropriate reaction, a grin, as opposed to the grimace it causes in this remake. I won't even bother commenting on the actual plot or meat of the movie, it really doesn't matter, it's just filler between the stunts. Other reviews put it perfectly, that this remake is just a bunch of Red Bull extreme sport YouTube videos pieced together and called a ""movie"". If you haven't seen the original, watch it. It might not hit you the same way as it did someone who saw it back in the day (for me, I saw it when it came out in 1991 when I was a kid) but you will hopefully appreciate it for a solid, entertaining action movie. Kathryn Bigelow is a legit director who knows how to inject soul in a movie - see Near Dark too, another one of her earlier movies that really shows how she can paint a picture of a tight-knit unit. I haven't seen any of Core's other movies and will actively avoid them after watching this empty Extreme Sports commercial shamelessly disguised as a movie."
" Man, so many Johnny Utah loyalists out there
",0.2732,0.7925,2020-06-13 00:00:00,7,I liked it. Of course it wasnt the original but did the original respect with clever twists on the original - good new take on presidents disguises / stepped up the stunts and cinemetograghy.
" Keeps the grip till end
",0.0,0.7964,2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,Lots of negetive reviews about this movie made me really think of people defined MOVIE. An extreme sport can be a movie and Point Break delivers it. Special cheery on top are the virgin locations around the world where it's been shot.

",0.0,-0.8099,2020-05-24 00:00:00,3,As a huge fan of the original I was hesitant to watch the remake...for a reason. Quite possibly the worst remake ever made. Horrible acting and a lame story to boot. Eco warriors as the villains!? Come on man! Keanu Reeves would be ashamed...
" Falls short
",0.0,0.7841,2020-05-13 00:00:00,5,"This movie had great potential but falls short. First off, the bond with these guys happens quick with almost no story to it. It's just not believable. The entire film is rushed. Great nature scenes and stunts but other than that, there is no substance for you to feel any emotion or connection to any of the characters. The acting isn't bad, there's just no where to go with a poorly written script."

To take a dive off a 3,212 foot mountain without a parachute, even into water, is NOT survivable. They would be dead. Come on, you expect us to believe that? I'm surprised no one that watched the movie didn't think, okay I can do that. Impossible, you would certainly crash and burn after jumping from that height."

",-0.7959,-0.5707,2020-02-09 00:00:00,1,Everyone involved in this should be ashamed of themselves. There's nothing positive about this shocking disrespectful trash. Wish they would delete it from existence. Don't waste your time.

Plot is a little crazy so if you're close-minded you probably won't like it."

-Yeah! That's original. We can update the extreme sports for the robbers.
-Awesome! We can get new audiences.

" Could've been better
",0.4404,0.9355,2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"The cinematography, the stunt, they're both on point. There's no denying that the movie could've been 100 times better. The acting was very decent, but some lines were pretty average. There's a lot of amazing stunts, but some kept going on and on, which is sad, if it was a little less it would've been way better. The reveal of Utah as a cop was also very weak, when you see the original it tends to leave you on the end of the seat in that department. You also expect Utah to do more at the end of the movie, while that's not the case which was a big let down. The ending was very weak and probably ruined the movie for more people. Next to that, the shots were very good and the directing was very good. Personally I liked the story, but not for this type of movie. I'd rather see a sport/adventure movie in a story like this, completing 8 heists doing the most dangerous stunts, something like that. I give it a solid 6,5 though, it kept me watching."
" A poor attempt to follow in the originals footsteps
",-0.4767,0.8113,2019-08-27 00:00:00,5,"First off, if your going to try and make a sequel or reboot of such an iconic film, please do it right. The visuals and action scenes in this film are great, the storyline isn't even that bad. What lets it down is awful acting and a cheesy script. With the right actors & slightly different script this could have been a fantastic film. Watchable but not a touch on the original."

" If you want to watch some extreme sports - nice views. That's all
",0.4767,-0.5001,2019-07-16 00:00:00,2,"I thought I saw the most if not all the worst movies of the last 2 or 3 decades - it's my hobby to watch them. So I don't know how I missed this rare pearl.Don't get me wrong here - the movie is packed with beautiful scenes of the extreme sports and if it fits somewhere, it's probably National Geographic or Discovery channel. But in other two categories: action and crime - it's pure 0 points. The characters are dull, the ""action"" (what action?) is there to kind of glue the sports scenes. Nothing more. IF you want to get bored or just ""watch the movie"" with your gf (if you know what I mean) that would be probably a good choice, as it will not keep your attention, and missing plenty of minutes doesn't change anything."

I don't think I've ever mentioned editing before but it just stood out in this movie because there were certain scenes when I was just confused about what was happening. And I'm not even talking about the action scenes. I'm talking about a scene at a party with people talking to each other and dancing. it had entertaining moments, mostly in the first third of the movie, but pretty terrible overall (1 viewing)"
" Sweating as a pig before the slaughter
",0.0,-0.8693,2019-06-21 00:00:00,4,"Once, years ago, I have watched the original 'Point Break' with slim Keanu Reeves and extreme Patrick Swayze and, as always, the remake news made me shiver. So, trying to get enjoyment from the movie I have decided to block all the past memories and that's what happened.Generally speaking, the ideas intersect but many points are different that earns respect for creators. Love that here the main drug for the criminals, the fuel for endeavors is adrenaline. This allows us to be witnesses of wild tricks that make your hands and back sweat like crazy. The intensity delivers the approach of the breaking point where mind sends the signals to stop but the blood rush forces you to continue.The plotline itself let me down by being kind of chewed: the scenes seems to be in chronological order but then suddenly the scene pops without any sufficient justification just to show yet another high morale talk with charming ambiance.Returning to an elephant in the room. Although the struggles were made to avoid shot-by-shot remake a bit of iconic moments jumped into the frame and my brain screamed: ""It is dumb to put it here!!"". Not only scraps of scenes visited us from the past but also the characters with their names freshened the spirits of old times.Honestly, nobody would notice the name change - meaning that every fan would appreciate a difference rather then not a good tribute. I am not talking about Luke Bracey and Edgar Ramirez because they did quite a good job, however, the latter could have been less philosophical. I was underscoring Ray Winstone's Pappas that in my opinion was a bleak reminiscence of Gary Busey.Still shaking from the enormous bursts of adrenaline I would say that the remake as expected didn't work out in a good way but presented with more than formidable extreme portrayal of action that deserves an applause. The problem is that I would rather find the compilation of the tricks on YouTube that rewatch the movie."

I'm sure the stunt people on this remake tried their best under the circumstances and direction but it still pales into insignificance compared to the original.

The first film was an epic - great story, cheesy one-liners and brilliant action.This remake (and, travesty though it was always going to be, one can understand how it was felt the original could use a reboot) was an abomination. Mind-numbingly cliched characters, the 'point break' of the first for some reason butchered to mean breaking point (someone, somewhere, came up with this idea - please take a very long hard look at yourself, whoever you are), the action as many have said representing no more than a cgi enhanced highlights real from the extreme sports channel.There really was nothing to like about this. Really, don't waste your time. If you've not seen the first, watch it instead. If you have, watch it again. If you don't want to watch it again (why not I ask!) then picking your eyes out slowly with a cocktail stick would be a better fate."
" Extreme Sports=Extreme Dud

The audience went on an absolute ride with these stars. The characters were well developed and story was plausible.
Fast forward to 2015 and Ericson Core brings us extreme sports involved with an FBI agent which subtly brings the audience an extreme dud. Extreme snowboarding, motor cross, surfing, wind gliding, rock climbing is all here. The story differs from the bank robbing of the original film as extreme athletes look to complete the Ozaki 8, extreme death defying events that harvest the earth, wind, rain, fire, all while liquidating companies of money, gold, diamonds.
The acting was extremely poor, characters did not develop as in the original, they fell flat and stale throughout. The action was ok at best."

I'm giving it a 7 just to support real stunts! The stunts in this movie are crazy, the cinematography, mind blowing. I was second guessing myself saying ""oh that's cg, oh now that's cg"". Sure there is CGI in this like any action movie but I thought it mostly blended with the real stunts! Standouts are the wingsuit and snowboarding scenes! Just awesome. The 3D was good too so pick this up on 3D Blu Ray if u can. I had a great time watching this."

" Should not be called Point Break - NOT A REMAKE

" Lots of great action but many other flaws
",0.3716,0.8699,2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"This film is packed to the brim with some absolutely fantastic action sequences covering almost any extreme sport that you can imagine. As the title implies, it's all about taking it all to the max - taking each challenge to it's most impossible and dangerous. If you like watching YouTube clips of people doing these kinds of stunts in real life, then you'll enjoy this movie. The action is very well shot and the backdrop for many of the scenes is stunning.Unfortunately there's more to a movie than just action. The plot is ridiculous and, to be honest, a bit too fast paced for it's own good. It goes from one thing to the next within seconds, with no buildup in between. We are teleported rapidly between scenes and it just seems a bit too much - they've just tried to cram too much into the movie to make it coherent. On top of this the character development is extremely limited and the characters' motives are completely nonsensical.Overall, though, it was a decent enough watch and I certainly don't regret spending the time to view it, but I am left disappointed by the whole structure. As we have seen with the Mission Impossible and James Bond franchises, there is a way to weld together great action and an excellent storyline, but here the latter seems to have been pushed aside. For me, it feels like unfulfilled potential. They did the expensive bits right but forgot about making them work together. Bit of a shame, really."

" Action...
",0.0,0.9935,2018-12-12 00:00:00,6,"""Point Break"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a young FBI agent trying to become a part of a very special team which consists of extreme sports athletes. He wants to become a part of it because he suspects that they are sophisticated corporate heists. Since he is going to be undercover for this mission he tries his very best in order to be accepted from the team and gain their trust. His life will be in danger and he has to prove to these athletes that he is one of them since they hunt the legend of the Ozaki 8 and are ready to do anything in order to achieve this goal.I liked this movie because it had a very unique and interesting plot. It was a very different crime movie from all the crime movies I had already watched because a lot of sports were involved. I liked the direction which was made by Ericson Core and I believe he did a great job on it since he combined very well many action scenes with sports and also the connection between the characters of the movie was very well placed. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I liked the interpretation of Luke Bracey who played as Johnny Utah and Edgar Ramírez who played as Bodhi.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Point Break"" is a nice action movie with a decent plot and some good interpretations. If you are a fan of action movies then you should watch it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you are going to have a lot of fun. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because is very interesting and shows us a different kind of achieving your goals."

" Local Color as Adrenalin High
",0.0,0.9973,2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"I have enjoyed watching this reboot of a classic film. I like both films, but I tend to be much more of a ""both/and"" kind of film aficionado than an ""either/or"" type. The actors all knew their lines, spoke with the sort of authority of those who have become their respective characters wholly, passionately and very convincingly. It is a brave film. The world has always been a very violent place. ""In a world where anything goes, judgement is everything."" One of my favorite high school counselors imparted that wisdom to me in 1983 when the school we both served in was stunned by a movie about the nuclear destruction of the world. Many teachers presented and discussed it; and counselors and additional professional people were on hand to provide solace, clarity, comfort, and advocacy. The film dramatizes what is humanly possible in terms of mind/body and soul. Socrates insisted and I still insist that ""The unexamined life is not worth living."" Ideas don't hurt people; fear of using our God given critical thinking gifts is what produces a Charles Manson, an Adolf Hitler, or a Boston Marathon fanatic. I love experiencing something via a book or a film, a lecture, anecdote, or reminiscence that vicariously imparts to me important truths; whether to accept or reject them is not up to a producer, director, or the performers. However, just as I would not attempt to explain the workings of a reciprocating engine to my new grand daughter, not every work of art is ready to be viewed, understood, and appreciated for what it is and what it is not. This film or clips from it would have provided a novel, sensory, discussion-worthy prompt for a film class, a creative writing group, or any audience that appreciates expanding their experiences in life.Were I still teaching Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition to high school seniors, I would couple this movie with the original 1991 ""Point Break"" along with ""Donnie Brasco"" for students to fully explore in a scholarly essay investigating synonymous, antithetical and synthetic parallels."

I knew it would be and went in with a 'devil may care' attitude towards it. However, I can't help but make comparisons to the original. I mean seriously Ray Winston as Pappas, I couldn't tell if his accent was American or cockney. One reviewer said that Luke Bracet made Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis.....never a more true word said. The plot was generic and although the action sequences were good it wasn't enough, and the 'firing gun in the air' was best done in Hot Fuzz. I could go on but I suggest watching the original as for watching this....well....ahem.......that would be a waste of time....lol.

" Looks good, but it's ultimately shallow
",0.2382,0.9592,2018-09-21 00:00:00,4,"POINT BREAK is another of the pointless remakes that have been the bane of Hollywood for the last couple of decades. This time around, it's the turn of the well remembered Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze-starrer of 1991. Aussie TV actor Luke Bracey takes on the Reeves role but fails to make much impact at all; he's certainly not sympathetic and he doesn't have that wide-eyed curiosity that Keanu brought to the role. Edgar Ramirez takes on the Swayze character but comes across as rather bland and perhaps miscast in what is an underwritten part. This film benefits from some great photography, with lots of rugged terrain and one jaw-dropping surfing sequence which might well be the best ever filmed. Sadly, the characters are shallow, the plot contrived, and nobody is remotely likeable. There are a few decent action scenes but, as nearly always, I'd reocmmend going with the original instead."

It succeeds on multiple fronts for me, and the cinematography and timing is superb. You get to go places that you probably will never go in your life time. I think people who are used to sitting on their couches and critiquing movies are making the reviews. You should not listen to them. This movie is a must-see, an experience of things few people will ever do in their lifetime, and yet... there are people doing them.What does it feel like to be truly free? It requires not only the external circumstance of being able to do ""what you want"" to do. It requires physical fitness, stamina, and your own inner choice to be free, regardless of the constraints of society. Doing what you believe and choose against all odds, taking the consequences for your actions, and then to know what it is to live without fear. FEARLESS.How many fearless people are reviewing this movie? There are few in the world, my friend, and I am one of them. This movie resonates with me for that reason."

The extreme risks these guys took to film Alone was worth 10 stars. The story was typical and plain, and the acting from Utah and Bodhi were Good. If you want to see Breath Taking scenery like NOTHING ELSE, with the plot to Point Break thrown in the middle, go see this.

The film is not particularly plot driven, and if you are not going to watch it in 3D or IMAX, don't bother.

FBI agent who also happens to be an extreme sports athlete infiltrates a group of extreme sports athletes who also happen to be eco-terrorists hellbent on completing the Ozaki 8 ordeals, a set of extreme sports ordeals, while also ""giving back"" to Mother Earth (read: committing crimes) and trying to save the planet from destruction. Have to say, this is by far one of the most original and inventive plots I've come across for a crime movie. Points off for a couple instances of poor executions/research (I study terrorism, so I pick up on this easily in these movies): 1. Bodhi telling Utah that he ""knew he was a cop from the beginning, but thought he could save him"" - this would NEVER happen in any extremist group ever. I get that they weren't a terrorist group in the original movie, but if you want to make them terrorists, you have to change the way you do things a little. 2. The whole thing about Bodhi being on the boat with Ozaki when he died, I mean... sure, it gives him motivation, but could we be any more predictable? 3. The romantic subplot between the girl and Utah was literally thrown in there for the sake of it and added nothing whatsoever to the plot. Furthermore, the one ""important"" female character was literally a sexy lamp and didn't participate in any of the group's activities until it came time for her to die for the male lead to have feels. 4. Another instance of ""these weren't initially terrorists but they are now"" poor execution: not that I don't understand that he wanted to complete the Ozaki 8, but no terrorist ever would just do something he knew was going to kill him without benefit to his cause. Again, maybe this was believable in the original movie, but it is not believable here. Characters: 7/10. I loved the character chemistry between Bodhi and Utah. Points off for no development of literally any other character. Especially in the case of Sexy Lamp lady who croaks for Man Tears. Cinematography: 10/10. Absolutely visually stunning movie. This is definitely the high point of the film, especially for the extreme sports fans among us. Atmosphere: 8/10. Pretty standard action movie atmosphere. Music: 9/10.Overall score: 8.2/10"

Imagine making a film about a Russian immigrant that opens a pain meds clinic in the United States and calling it Doctor Zhivago. You get the idea. Neither of the ideas that I have listed here is inherently terrible, although neither one would probably be a masterpiece. The problem with these two ideas is that I have taken the title of a previously made film that was of a very high quality and a classic and grafted it onto my so-so film ideas. That is the problem with the 2015 ""remake"" of Point Break, a film released in 1991 about a group of extreme sports aficionados that finance their globetrotting pursuit of their hobby by robbing banks. That film was filled with imaginative storytelling and great action sequences and is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again.Here's the thing. The 2015 version of Point Break is about a group of extreme sports aficionados that commit crimes not to finance their lifestyle, but as part of some high minded mumbo jumbo filled spiritual quest. In itself the 2015 film is not completely terrible, it just seems that way because the creators decided to graft the title of a really great and memorable film onto it and doomed it to being compared to a much better film.

But after watching it I was surprised it wasn't actually a complete copy of the 1991 Point Break. The story is different in many points but unfortunately it isn't better. The good thing about the movie are the stunts and the nature shots. But it was just not enough to make it a good movie. It's an average movie with special effects that could have been much better when you see the budget they had. The acting was just okay without being great. It's just the story that was lousy written. And that's the most important thing for any movie. If you don't have a good script you don't get a good movie. That's a fact.
" Point Break – 'Point-less'
",0.0,0.9877,2017-07-01 00:00:00,4,"I'm sorry, there must be tonnes of reviews out there that have used the 'pointless' pun. I couldn't help it. It's just too obvious. In case you didn't know, 'Point Break' is a classic action/cop movie of the nineties. Therefore, because of its 'classic' status, it was deemed 'remakeable' by our good friends - those wonderful Hollywood executives. Now, I like to think I'm not a 'remake snob' – there are arguments for remaking a film, normally if you have a fresh take on something, or if the film was made so long ago that people have practically forgotten the original. However, 'Point Break' was only made in the nineties and is still pretty dear to many people – namely me. I may be able to forgive this new version for anything other than a cynical cash-grab if the original source material was particularly outdated, but unfortunately the sad fact is that the (dare I say 'proper?') 'Point Break' still looks as good today as it ever did.In case you don't know, both 'Point Breaks' are about a young FBI agent (Johnny Utah) who has to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers led by 'Bodhi' who indulge in extreme sports, in order to gain their trust and catch them, obviously. Whereas the original had Keanu Reeves playing our FBI hero and Patrick Swayze as the lead robber, the new one has er, actually I don't know either of them. I like to think I'm reasonably good with actors, but I've never seen either of these two in anything! But, I won't hold that against them. I'll save my disdain for the chemistry between pretty much everyone on screen. Everyone just seemed to be trying too hard to steer away from what we already know about the film, but never really achieving it. This new 'Point Break' incarnation is like a meteorite that's got hopelessly trapped in a planet's gravitational pull and is fighting against the odds in a losing battle to escape.The new 'Point Break' does its best to try and create something new. The bank robbers don't just surf like they do in the original and it's set across multiple locations around the world, rather than just a single beach in America, but it's simply not enough. I've briefly touched upon the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, but this really becomes obvious when they try and throw in the obligatory 'love interest' in there for Johnny Utah the 2nd. It's truly painful. Almost as bad as watching (the usually awesome) Ray Winstone as Johnny's partner Angelo Pappas. It's just weird hearing these names again, only seeing different faces associated with them.Believe it or not, I didn't hate the remake. It's a decent enough film and, if you're into anything from extreme sports to cops and robbers films, you'd probably get some entertainment out of it. But there's a MAJOR but. This only applies if you've never seen the original. If you've watched that you'll be crying out for a slice of Reeves and Swayze. So, if you haven't already seen the original, go and watch that – it's a true classic of its time which still holds up today. Let the remake be a message to Hollywood that we're not interested in seeing all our favourite movies redone just to make a quick buck."

Yet, the action and the scenery is inspiring. In comparison, this is like a Bond movie : 1) Bad guy willing to to use any means to an end meets good guy trying to stop him. 2) Good guy and bad guy might even find some shared values and love interests. 3) Together they race through beautiful scenery with sometimes implausible technological assists. 4) Creating a bit of suspense amidst a lot of amazing visual perspectives. I generally rate Bond movies 6 to 8. This Point Break remake is at least as good as Bond action and better in some ways - mainly it's a bit more plausible. Instead of a super spy and diabolical bad guy both with unreal tech tools, it's 'sort of real' extreme athletes doing radically dangerous action. Just enjoy the scenery and stunt action."

This poor take on the classic is a complete travesty in every way possible; essentially it's a shameless extended Red Bull or GoPro commercial. In every frame there's an outdoor equipment or extreme sports brand in full view, front and center. There's really no plot to speak of, I think there's something about an FBI agent trying catch some bad guys, and that's about it. Even the main character seems to forget WTF he's supposed to be doing. For a bit in the middle I really did forget what the hell he was supposed to be doing. It's really a poor excuse to film beautiful young people doing dangerous sports. The acting is nonexistent and even when there is some acting, it's horrific to say the least. Now I know why Edgar Ramirez doesn't get much to say in whatever movies he's in because the guy is just terrible, he's as stiff as the rock that he throws over the cliff. To be honest I don't understand the hype around the guy. The lead guy - I don't even know who TF he is - playing Utah is an insult to the great Keanu Reeves. The lines are completely laughable, they're like lines ripped straight from Robin Sharma's The Monk who Sold His Ferrari - just some voodoo, mystic mumbojumbo about being one with the earth or some BS like that. Which is sort of ironic because they spend most of the movie ripping the earth apart with motor bikes, guns, bombs and whatever they can get their tattooed hands on.

If extreme sports are your thing and story is not an issue then you may enjoy it (just), the set pieces are terrible, the acting is macho (to the point of What Is This Movie about, just be a man and it will be OK). The movie's CGI is good (what else would you expect from this budget). I hope I am not alone in thinking ""what did they do to the script?"" ""What did they do!"" Everything that could have made this re-make bad they did! 10 fold! I hope in the coming years this is done with the panache and grittiness the original did so well."
" Really liked it
",0.4754,0.5898,2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,In my opinion a really good movie. Well filmed action and a nice plot. Good acting and a really compelling story. Not necessarily 'good' but really fun to watch. I have never seen the original but I suspect a lot of the bad ratings are due to people comparing it to the original and not seeing it as the stand alone masterpiece it is. Aran doesn't know what he was talking about.
" What a waste
",-0.4215,0.4864,2017-04-13 00:00:00,3,"So, we're just remaking all of Swayze's movies now, right? And if the do-overs are good, that's no problem. But ""Point Break"", aiming for passable, still misses the mark. This thing's a self-important mess, and really sucks the fun out of everything. The mysticism is deathly serious with no balancing levity. I guarantee you'll be missing the better actors of the original movie, and that's before getting to the halfway mark.I admit I maintained a cautious optimism at first (hey, I get a charge out of hearing The Black Keys just as anybody), but this thing's just a vacuum of excitement, in spite of the extreme sports emphasis. I never though I'd say this, but watch ""The Fast and the Furious"" instead. It's the better remake.3/10"
" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.2474,2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original."
" Point Break Review
",0.0,0.9334,2017-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Point Break of 2015 could have been called anything else and it would have been a better movie. So, let's get going on this.Synopsis: A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists. Deep undercover, and with his life in danger, he strives to prove these athletes are the architects of the mind-boggling crimes that are devastating the world's financial markets. Starring: Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey Director: Ericson CoreHere's where the problem lies with this movie: Because of the name a lot of people compared this movie to the original. My thoughts on that are the fact there have been other movies out there that have used the same story line. A rookie cop goes undercover to try to stop a bunch of robbers committing crimes. Hmmm? Wasn't there a movie that came out in 2001 with that same plot line? You know, one that involved cars? There's like eight of those movies now. They just keep getting better. I can't remember what it's called though.So, anyway, jokes aside. The movie wasn't a bad movie. It seemed they just sort of said towards the end, ""Well, I don't know what to do here."" The ending had no excitement to it. It was the biggest let down to the entire movie.The actors didn't do too bad for the type of movie it is. There was no way this movie was going to get Oscar worthy performances, and I wasn't expecting anything. I wish they would have gotten the original choice to play Bodhi in Gerard Butler, but Ramirez did okay. Again, it came down to everyone comparing actors.Not only should they have changed the name for the movie, they should have changed the name of the characters. This movie was doomed in a lot of people's eyes before it even came out.The best part of the movie was the practicality of it. Ericson Core made a decision to use real locations and little to none CGI in the movie. It worked for the movie. Probably extremely dangerous, but it worked. Sure it may have been a bit expensive, but it made the movie better. A lot people would use substitutes for locations, this movie made it so you could understand the beauty what the guys were trying to do.Final Thoughts: All they had to do was change six characters names and the name of the movie. It would have been at least a star better.Rating: 6 out of 10"
" Not even cheese...
",0.0,-0.9186,2017-03-04 00:00:00,2,"I saw a Japanese website mistakenly wrote the title as ""Point Bleak"" (R/L confusion- common). But actually, probably a more accurate title. The dialogue is so bad, it's not even cheesy. They demystified the characters, especially Bodhi. I don't know if Édgar Ramírez is normally this wooden... and Luke Bracey as Utah? I can't.Go watch the original, and give this a miss."
" Possibly one of the worst movies ever.
",-0.6249,0.395,2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"A strong contender for worst movie ever.The thrills may be authentic, but they pale in comparison with a lot of ""amateur"" stuff on Youtube.The plot was not even ridiculous, merely pathetic.I seldom rate a movie here, but I just felt I had to warn you about this one."
" One of my TOP 10 WORST movies ever!!!
",-0.6341,0.9653,2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"This is my first review ever although I have been a member of IMDb for years,the reason for my review is to warn people how ridiculously bad this movie is!!!! Luckily I saw it on TV and switched of halfway through the movie,so don't expect an in-depth review but rather a warning.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAP!!!! I'm a big fan of the original,it was made in the 90's and by today's standards it maybe a little over the top,but at least there were some sort of character building and a bond between them.According to this new movie an FBI agent jumps of a cliff and calls someone ""Bro"" and suddenly has an internal bond with a criminal,who by the way just killed a few innocent people 5 min ago!?!?!?Ray Winstone is a brilliant actor but not even he can save this senseless ""Red Bull"" advert and makes one wonder is work really that hard to find for someone of his caliber?? How this got a Rating of 5.5 in IMDb doesn't say much for the rating system as I have seen much better movies on here rated 2.5 either that or most of the reviewers of this movie is 12yr old school boys who like tattoos???"
" Neither better nor worse than the original. They both suck.
",-0.6317,-0.1154,2017-02-10 00:00:00,5,"There was the germ of a good idea in the original Point Break that was ruined by all the mystical woo that was supposed to justify the whole thing. In principal this movie could have extracted that good idea, removed the mystical nonsense, given everyone sane motivations, and provided us with a great action movie. Instead we get the same idiotic dialog, and the same ridiculous behavior (""let's accept random strangers into our tight club because the universe tells me to"") as the first time round. The one thing this movie does better than its predecessor is that the action sequences/stunts, and the scenery are vastly superior. But the parts between those sequences and that scenery are pretty damn painful to sit through. Who knows, maybe in twenty years or so we'll get a second remake, this time stripped of the ""spiritual bromance"" nonsense?"
" Not a remake.
",0.0,0.9774,2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"Maybe I am narrow minded but there a number of films I don't thinks should ever be re-made. Point Break is one of them. The makers of this film seem to agree as the absolute bare minimum of lip service was made to link this with the original. So I can easily review this film on its own meritsThis film is all about the set pieces. They are fantastic and you get a lot for your money, snow boarding, surfing, sky diving, etc.The problem is there is hardly any story. This film is like a series of glossy Car Commercials. Pretty but ultimately boring.The characters are very flat and insipid. The director relies on gimmicks like funny accents, six packs and body tattoos in lieu of any proper characterisation.For this film to succeed you really need to get on board with the protagonists, which is difficult when they are such unlike-able, sanctimonious douche bags. This was an OK action film to have on in the back ground whilst you do something else."
" Good For What it Is
",0.4404,0.9844,2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Not expecting Citizen Kane here.Also not really comparing this movie to the original.Sure the plot and acting leave a lot to be desired. But the stunts, colors, action, and cinematography are fulfilling and fantastic. You could tell the whole stunt and design team put their hearts into creating some EPIC extreme sports scenes for this movie. I'd be really proud of the movie as a whole if I worked on it.If you can get past some of the glaring issues you'll find a very enjoyable movie underneath. The casting isn't so bad. You can watch some very beautiful people try and emasculate each other for 2 hours."
" Entertaining but needs some familiar faces
",0.2382,0.8469,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Now this would have been a decent movie if it wasn't a remake of a cult classic from 1991. The visuals and action sequences are actually pretty entertaining but Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze Who were in the original were replaced by two guys that I had never seen or heard of before .if they could have cast actors like Taylor Kitsch, Tom Hardy, Ben Foster, or Emile Hirsh just to name a few it would have made all the difference in the world . The action scenes made it watchable but it was just a really good bad movie with these actors. So unfortunately they wasted the opportunity to remake a good 90's action film. I saw the list of actors considered I don't know if everyone refused or what happened but with a 100 million dollar budget they deffinitley could have afforded some familiar faces.!"
