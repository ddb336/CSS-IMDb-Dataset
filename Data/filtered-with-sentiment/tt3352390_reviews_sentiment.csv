" friend request....yes if you have brains you could guess the whole story.
",0.4939,0.7506,2021-04-02 00:00:00,5,Just another stereotype thriller which you wouldn't be able to finish if you like movies with good content. If you have never seen any modern social media adaptation with a thriller cliche tag. You might like it.
" DO NOT WATCH FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY
",0.4215,-0.9509,2021-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Guys I am not joking please do not watch this movie I am actually being serious. I watched this movie on Netflix and the day my dad shot himself with a double barreled shotgun. I think I am being haunted by the ghost of marina. everywhere I look I see spooky ghosts and marinas soul. its really creeping me out. I tried calling the police but they just told me I was being crazy. I tried to kill marina but she would not die, just like the movie! I dont know what to do and I am scared for my life."
" I really liked it!
",0.5244,0.9411,2021-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This film isn't amazing or terrible, it's one of the very middle rate horrors but it's still very enjoyable, entertaining and well made. It's slightly predictable and follows the same kids premise of unfriended but in a far more watchable film- without being all on a computer screen flicking between apps! Personally I think unfriended was a slightly better film but I still really like this and have rated them both the same- 6/10. I know everyone will have an opinion and a lot of them negative but give it a go, it's worth a watch! I've sat though many high rated films that I've not enjoyed as much as this film!
All in all I've watched it 4 times now and still enjoy it every time I see it!"

" Basic Movie
",0.0,-0.9616,2020-09-28 00:00:00,5,"The plot of this movie is not bad at all, in my opinion. Maybe there are a few writing choices that made confused me and some of the acting was questionable, but it was a very basic horror movie. The lore of the main antagonist was introduced well. There's really nothing more I could say about the movie besides that it was very basic. The jump scares were done well, too. I wouldn't sit down and watch this movie again because I would probably fall asleep, but if you are new to the horror movie genre, I'd recommend this movie to you. From a scary scale of 1-10, it's a 4. If you scared easily, it's a 6. If you don't scare at all, it's probably a 2. There are scarier movies out there to watch, but this is sort of the appetizer to scary movies."

",-0.2911,0.9598,2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"Yeah it was jump scares ~ but they worked on me.
People say this has been done before. I suppose using social media as the plot point, sure, but this was pretty well done.
I was scared. The light's on in my room!
Seriously, though, it wasn't completely predictably. That was good.
Here's the thing for me, that makes a movie more complete. The dialogue when the story isn't being pushed. The writers and actors don't try to shove personalities down your throat in the down time.
The banter was actually funny. The conversations kept things moving. I though it woulad go one way and it went another.
Pretty good movie. And to think I almost didn't watch it because of all these wanna be critics."
" Tropes and gore

Or if you have a problem with charters bashing their heads against the wall until they die, stabbing, or shooting themselves, I would also not recommend it for you. Or if you want a movie that doesn't overuse tropes and make you feel gross and uncomfortable as opposed to scared. Really really bad."
" Sucked
",-0.4588,-0.9652,2020-08-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie was very bad. It was both sucky and unwatchable. I checked the parents guide and it gave NO warning to how much gore and otherwise sensitive material would be shown. Besides being insensitive and sucky, it was also plain tasteless. There was no on screen chemistry, there were SO many soggy kisses, and the characters time and time again brushed off death and gruesome suicides with casual indifference. I hated this movie. Do not watch it."

" Preposterous premise; cheap low-level scares that do not scare you
",0.0588,-0.6745,2020-06-17 00:00:00,3,"I randomly found this flick on Netflix. I did not watch any trailer nor read anything about it and simply clicked on it and watched it. As usual, I dived in completely blind.The film starts off with realism and then switches to the preposterous supernatural.This flick has many cheap low-level ""scares"" that are predictable and not scary at all.The premise of the supernatural is eventually revealed and it reaches its climax at the end, but it is still preposterous and I could just not take this movie seriously once it diverted into the supernatural.This flick was so boring that I was on my phone during most of it. Maybe its intended audience is kids who do not know what horror is? Certainly not anyone older than that with half a brain.Conclusion: I would not recommend this film. I regret wasting my time with it. Even though its ending was slightly interesting, and the Facebook premise decent, the supernatural stuff is too preposterous and this movie just felt fake and not scary at all. It is probably for kids under 12.3/10"
" Unoriginal 'horror' anything but. Avoid.
",-0.4215,0.8902,2020-04-30 00:00:00,3,Cliched 'horror' with some ensemble of originality I suppose using Social Media as a backdrop.Although no particular site is mentioned by name it is pretty clear what it is.The story revolves around a U.S. student Laura in reality played by a bit part Australian 'actress' Alicya Debnam Carey who has 850 or so 'friends' on the social media site. However one day she receives a friend request from the college loner/outcast Marina (Liesehl Ahlers? who) who has zero friends on the site it appears. What follows is two weeks of stalking until Marina commits suicide. After the death strange videos apparently from Marina appear on Laura's newsfeed giving the impression that Laura was bullying Marina which wasn't true. 80 minutes or so of horror cliches follow as Laura's friends count slowly erodes. The film cleverly counts this down on screen. At the end of the film the roles are apparently reversed.The film if I was so kind to call it that has little artistic merit and is nothing more than B-film fodder. The cast are completely unknown and have little to work with. In one scene a poster for Streetcar Named Desire is shown on the wall of Laura's room I think. If only.. I will think different about posting film reviews on social media sites again I suppose!Avoid this film if at all possible.
" Not too bad, give it a go!

" Disturbingly Interesting Premise Squandered by Gimmicky Pay Off
",-0.25,-0.9596,2020-03-21 00:00:00,3,"If there's one notable horror movie that I would use as the dictionary definition example of wasted potential, it would be the 2016 supernatural psychological flick, Friend Request. Released in 2016 around Europe and 2017 in America, the film failed to garnish any notable attention and just swept under the rug with every other forgettable horror movie released in the 2010 decade. However, what does separate it from other generic supernatural flicks is the direction it could have gone had it not chosen the safe route that every other bland horror film does nowadays.The film centers around a popular college student named Laura, who graciously accepts an online friend request from the socially outcast Marina, but once Laura unfriends her, Marina commits suicide. Soon, a disturbing video shows up on Laura's profile, causing her contacts to decrease and her friends to be murdered one by one. Based on that premise alone, the most interesting aspect of the movie would be the relationship between Laura and Marina, with one being a well known popular girl, and the other being a depressed and lonely outcast, albeit with a affinity for the macabre. Given how Laura meant so much to Marina to the point of losing her own mental capacity over a sudden mistake, the film almost highlights how some people are too toxic to be around, even if you want to be nice to them. The film itself could have been a fascinating character study of Marina that would have fleshed out just how unfortunately twisted she became, and to their credit, the filmmakers did try to give some decent exposition to Marina's past at an orphanage which led her down a dark path.However, where the film really wastes its promising concept is in the execution, as it chose to scrap any chance of proper development on Marina in favor of a generic slasher movie arc. Throughout the picture, Laura's friends are murdered one by one in a typical Friday the 13th fashion, with the same old boring jump scares and tired slow moving gimmicks we've come to expect now. Admittedly, the ways the people are killed off are creative in their own way, but the fun is sadly undermined by how weak the whole build up to them are. Plus, the arc of Laura losing friends socially would have been an interesting moment of karma, but even that's sadly undermined from how flat most of the people and even Laura herself are, as we're never given enough time to really care for them enough to feel sorry for them. And without giving away the ending, talk about leaving on an unresolved and frankly pathetic conclusion, as it feels more like the story chose to stop rather than making a satisfying book end to the narrative. When a movie chooses to highlight gimmicks over substance, that's a surefire sign of failure.In the end, while Friend Request had the makings of a potentially interesting character study disguised as a horror movie, it squandered all of that with generic scares, bland characters and a weak ending. Even for a movie that utilizes social communication as a commentary for people's mental health, Facebook no less, it surprisingly has little to do with the ""technology that it ostensibly exists to critique"" (Jessica Kiang of Variety). If you're going to promote websites like that and twist them around as caution for teens to use, then you should use it to its full advantage, not as plug in gimmicks like how this movie attempts to scare us."
" Definitely horror
",-0.25,-0.6157,2020-03-07 00:00:00,6,"This movie have constant element of horror. Takes you through a lot of spine chilling scenes but in the end loses the interest. Ending also doesn't bring any logic. However, if you like horror movies, should see this.

Obviously predictable but still good enough to keep you watching to the end and enjoy it. Some of the fx felt a bit ""cheap"" (like the white lenses on dead people - it screams ""trying too hard"" and it would've been better without it) but overall it's an OK movie.
The animation bit that was very good and I think it's worth mentioning. Truly beautiful stuff."

" Average
",0.0,0.7964,2019-10-29 00:00:00,5,"A good start, promising, but then the movie disappoints you, first of all in my opinion you should not mix occult and modern technology, reduces the quality of the story, decide, rituals and ghosts, or cyberbullying and frantic psychopaths. The lead actress did a fantastic job, but there were plenty of actors who were on the verge of amateur. All in all the film had great potential that was not used enough."

" A horror movie for the social media crowd.
",-0.5719,0.933,2019-07-08 00:00:00,1,"This is another in a long line of low budget movies that have latched onto social media as the next go to source of chills and scares. Unfortunately it's written with all the subtlety of a pie to the face and instead of exploring social ills, how things online can get distorted or other aspects of online culture it just goes for ""if you have no friends you're a bad person"". And that's basically the story.We have your typical college student Laura that has a lot of online friends and spends time with them online and some in real life. We have social outcast and misfit Marina who is in the same class but has no friends. She sends a friend request to Laura which Laura accepts and suddenly Marina worms her way into Laura's life. You know, like how a crazy person would do. Being friends on Facebook does not mean you need to hang out all the time nor does it mean you get invited to things like parties, celebrations and other events. But Marina thinks it does and when she finds out that Laura dared to have a birthday party with a few real friends which didn't include Marina she goes completely ballistic, you know, like a crazy person would. Laura has no choice but to unfriend her and now the real trouble starts. Marina kills herself in a ritual that will curse Laura and leave her friendless. And that's more or less the rest of the movie.This is a silly movie made for silly reasons and all that could be forgiven if it was good but it's not. It's bland and while it shows that living your life on Facebook can have consequences those consequences really only exist online. Wipe your profile clean and start with a new one and all those old problems will have disappeared. But people are so attached to their Facebook pages they can't even conceive of doing this.I just want a good internet based horror movie that isn't incredibly stupid. Is that too much to ask?"
" Entertaining horror movie

Although the acting of the actors is not that great just ok but movie is enjoyable and successfully binds u with it till the end.They also created a good horror atmosphere that will make u think twice before accepting an unknown friend request.This is the movie that u can watch more than 1 time and still like it and i think the overall the movie is great"
" Not the Friend You Want At Your School!
",-0.3859,-0.8938,2019-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I have been putting off watching this movie even though I have heard rave reviews about it. The reason being the things I was hearing were kind of a touchy subject for me. I'll give you kind of a priest synopsis but no spoilers here. I hate it when people spoil a movie!Basically, our heroin which I could not believe was the same girl that played my beloved Lexa from The 100 had a group of friends that were really tight and hung out and did almost everything together. In class and around school she noticed this girl who seem to be a loner and ridiculed by other students, but she had the most beautiful hunting drawings! Our heroin attempted to reach out to her and in a way befriend her, but all of a sudden, the girl was taking things too far and trying to alienate her from the rest of her friends including her boyfriend who just happens to be the ruggedly handsome actor who played Peter in the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe series of movies! Once again another actor I didn't recognize until I got onto IMDb! The girl wanted her full undivided attention as I call it with my boy tiger cat when he gets upset if I'm typing on my phone like now LOL! Our heroin was not impressed and was not about to give up all of her friends. That did not sit well with this girl. And that's as far as I'm going to say because that's little more then you would get out of watching previews of the movie.I'm going to tell you why I didn't give this more than 7 Stars. Without giving too much information away, I felt like some of the other people did but even more so that this movie had a high potential for having been written a whole lot better. This movie about friend requests on Facebook is really something that people deal with all the time as far as fake profiles and people trying to get you to send them money, or guys sending girls nasty pictures or girls wanting guys to send them money and then they send nasty pictures to the guys, cam girls I think they're called. But there's a far far more sinister angle that some of us have had to deal with that the general population hasn't had to deal with but I think if this movie tapped into the depths of that horror that a person feels when they are being cyber stalked through Facebook this movie could have been a whole lot scarier. Let me give you an example. I have been a music industry executive for 25 years. But I've also done some occasional modeling and been on some metal bands CD covers. Even without that people knew who I was and I had a bit of a cult following if you will of people who knew me wanted by autograph that sort of thing and I keep telling people I'm not the star, the musicians are! Then about 6 years ago, I became a media influencer when I started opening up music pages on Facebook. I would post concerts that I would be at because I would try to generate excitement for my bands that I had booked and 99% of the time that was a good thing people would come we'd say hi, Hangout, I sign an autograph for two, they buy merch from my bands, they'd get to meet the band's, and it was good time. But once in awhile things weren't perfect but there was one incident that went real bad. I had two guys come from about an hour and a half away and they stood there and stared at me for about 20 minutes and I heard the Sound guy tell them to approach me, that I didn't bite, after he got them to tell him that they were there to see me and my bands. So they came up to where I was with one of my bands, they said hello, we did the whole autograph thing, then they wanted to sit down at the band table. And it was fine for a couple minutes because the band was a black metal band so they were out back getting their makeup on. And I told them as much. Then they wanted to get me a drink and would not take no for an answer eventually they just showed up with a drink and I didn't touch it because I don't drink when I'm out and I certainly don't accept a drink that's been in somebody's hands besides someone I trust or the bartender. The band came back and they would not give them their seats back! They had me cornered! So I told them that they were going to have to get up because I had to go to the bathroom. When I got out of the bathroom from playing around with my lipstick and my hair and just trying to kill time, they were still there so I went out back and had a cigarette not that I smoked much but I wanted to stay away from them. They were still there! So I called in bodyguard. When he got there, he just stood next to me to kind of block them. They didn't like it, they went into the bathroom when he went in there smashed a beer bottle and attempted 2 attack him with it! They had to be removed, the sound guy was also The Bouncer and he apologized profusely. But I've also had friend request from fans who then hack into my phone and somehow found out where I was at exactly and where my home was that exactly and wanted to know when I was going to be home! And I was terrified because I was out with my son shopping and I don't want to take my son into some kind of ambush but I felt like in that moment every corner of my life was completely unsafe and picked over like a spider pics over a web. That! That right there is what terror is! And I don't think that movie truly sinks to the depths that it was capable of.Now all of that being said, I think it was a decent movie and it's worth the watch."

Our girl tries so benevolently to friend the outsider, who is an outsider for no given reason; she just likes macabre media. She would so find people with common interests. The art she makes as the movie's way of showing us she's DARK are the most artistically competent things in the whole movie.Then it's the formula of going to the right places and asking the right questions to make up a picture of what is happening. The movie is so smug about how it makes modern technology syncretize with olde school magic.I will give credit that it is somewhat unnerving that one can be so easily framed with fabricated material due to the limitless nature of cyberspace but the idiocy of the movie is more than a fair price to suffer for that."

" dumber than dirt
",-0.5994,-0.9792,2019-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Laura Woodson (Alycia Debnam-Carey) and her college friends all live online as most everybody else at school. She gets a friend request from fellow student Marina Mills. She notices that Marina has no friends but has created intriguing spooky art. She accepts the friend request and is quickly flooded with Marina's attention. She grows frightened by the nightmarish posts. Marina is angered when Laura fails to invite her to Laura's birthday. Laura decides to unfriend Marina setting off supernatural retributions. The class is told that Marina committed suicide but evidence of her has disappeared.At first, I confused Alycia Debnam-Carey with Taissa Farmiga. It's symptomatic of this movie. It reminds me of bigger and better names. This is a B-movie version of better movies. There are issues holding it back. First, what's up with the boyfriend's apartment? Is he a millionaire? That's some view. For a more serious problem, the movie needs to foreshadow its supernatural bent earlier. I was expecting a more Single White Female situation. Also how do the cops figure out Marina had committed suicide if everything goes missing. And the cops are dumber than dirt. They keep accusing (not accusing) Laura. It's all ridiculously fake. That goes for everybody. I know we roll our eyes when people claim their dick pics are the result of hacking. It doesn't mean that hacking doesn't exist. I can't believe that Kobe is the only person to look into the code and find the witchcraft text. Every college has tech departments. It'd be cool to show this weird coding to computer students and professors. It's all dumber than dirt. There are two good things I got out of the movie. Black Mirror is one of my favorite shows. I figured it's a reference to the blackness of a computer screen but I didn't realize its old origins. Secondly, I got really excited by Kobe's solution to his problem. I hadn't thought of it but it's completely logical. It's a great twist but not nearly enough to save this dumb horror."

Well, this whole situation could have been avoided if Laura, the leading lady, had just denied a friend request from an outsider with zero friends. But, we love a good a good demon story so of course the opposite occurred, hence the title. #dontmakefriendsonlineLaura is a kind, beautiful college student that takes pity on a mysterious girl, Marina, and befriends her. She immediately regrets this decision as she gets glimpses into her dark world. Let's begin with her Facebook page; what? So many weird, ominous, creepy images and videos. Red flag! As the story unfolds, Laura's real friends find themselves in danger after she de-friends Marina. Is Marina to blame or could it be a demon? We may never know as the plot thickens at the end; the story is stuck in a continuous loop - sorry Laura, welcome to HELL.Most likely to stay on Netflix: Friend Request movie - Voted best movie to have as background noise while packing for Vegas. You may forget you have it on.Most gruesome scene: Gustavo - a lovely little scene of him walking back and forth in the elevator banging his head against the wall.Most likely to delete their social media account: Probably anyone who viewed this film.Overall Grade: C."

" Just another run-of-the-mill modern horror
",-0.5719,-0.9523,2019-01-06 00:00:00,5,"'Friend Request' is built upon the same premise as 'Unfriended' (2014) and explores the dark tendrils of the Internet and social media. Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey) befriends lonely new girl, Marina (Liesl Ahlers) and accepts her friend request on Facebook. However, when Marina becomes obsessed with Laura and begins to stalk her, Laura unfriends her and supernatural chaos ensues.'Friend Request' is an unoriginal concept that is executed reasonably well. The acting, in comparison to other films of its type, is good although the characters lack in any substance or personality. The plot is predictable and underwhelming, but still engaging throughout. There are a few jump scares that caught me unaware and generally there is a reasonable amount of suspense throughout, although avid horror fans are unlikely to be scared or on the edge of their seat whilst watching.What 'Friend Request' succeeds in is bringing to attention the damage social media can do to today's young people, albeit in an unrealistic and dramatic way. Laura's apparent addiction to social media and inability to stay off her Facebook page despite how much destruction it appears to be causing speaks to the social media addiction many of us face. No matter how ugly a place the Internet/social media is or how much of a negative impact it may have on our lives, we keep coming back for more.Overall, 'Friend Request' left me feeling lukewarm. It wasn't terrible and I've seen much worse, but it's not revolutionary and doesn't attempt to do anything new. It consists of a typical and stereotypical horror formula and ticks all of the boxes, but in a rather boring and underwhelming way. Nonetheless, it has its redeeming qualities and for a horror of this sort isn't as terrible as you might expect it to be. Just don't go in with high expectations and this may just verge on the edge of an enjoyable viewing experience."

When Laura finally sees sense and unfriends the psycho, Ma Rina kills herself in a magic ritual that sees her return as a vengeful demon hellbent on leaving Laura as popular as a sausage at a Bar Mitzvah.What follows is bland teen-friendly supernatural horror that delivers predictable jump scares and a modicum of gore, but virtually nothing in the way of originality. I was so enthralled that I found myself frequently distracted by a Catfish marathon on MTV. A dumb twist in the final act and a really crap ending are the final nails in the coffin.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for having Laura receive a deep stab wound in the abdomen, but still manage to run away from her attacker and hail a taxi and not bleed to death or pass out from the pain."

Who exactly are you accepting as a 'friend' on what is to all intents and purposes Facebook? And especially pertinent - how social media has become a vital part of our lives; a few years ago, a subject like this wouldn't have existed.Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is being cyber-stalked after accepting a friend request from the classroom outcast, who sees her as a 'sister.' Marina (Liesl Ahlers) is something of a textbook 'weirdo' - on one hand she is just another pretty girl who chooses to dress down and indulge herself in goth imagery. On the other, she is genuinely fragile, stigmatised by a hair-pulling disorder. Things become typically intense, with Marina taking her subsequent rejection extremely badly and displaying she possesses certain demonic qualities.What I thought was going to be blighted by depictions of the youngsters as massively irritating (teensploitation?), actually takes various satisfyingly dark turns and provides some successful mood-pieces and jump-scares. However, it is content to follow the paths of other horrors before it (particularly 'The Ring', I thought), and although the characters are fairly likeable, there's little to distinguish them. That said, what this does, it does well."

However I was very surprised by how much I liked this film. It is by no means one of the best horror films around but it certainly isn't the worst, which is why I do not understand all the negative reviews. It has everything you would want for a 90 minute horror flick and has enough jumps and scares to keep you interested. I was surprised that it turned into basically a witch movie but with a modern take which I thought was a nice little twist. It starts out as your basic teen horror with a slightly odd girl stalking the popular girl but at around 30 minutes goes off in a completely different direction which I thought was good. The way the film uses social media as the main scare factor is very relevant in today's society what with the increase and awareness in cyber bullying. If your looking for a nice quick horror film to watch then I would recommend this movie. The acting is good as is the plot, most of the jumpy scenes I would say have there desired affect. As a horror film film I have rated this a sold 6/10."

" Social media can host evil
",-0.6597,-0.3912,2018-08-28 00:00:00,6,"This thriller can become pretty scary, when you wait for it. Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is a college coed that out of sympathy accepts a friend request from a lonely, friendless female student on social media. Marina (Liesl Ahlers), if that is even her real name, has zero friends on Facebook and is desperate for a friend. Marina is a more than a bit strange and hiding in a dark world on the computer, and obviously starts stalking Laura. When Laura decides to unfriend the weird young woman, Laura's friend list starts shrinking due to strange circumstances. FRIEND REQUEST is not a perfect movie; but it does have some predictable jumps scattered about and the feeling of hopelessness is unnerving. The movie has enough of what it takes to sustain your attention. Also featured in the cast: William Moseley, Susan Danford, Connor Paola, Shahawnee Hall, Brooke Markham, Dorothy Ann Gould and Sean Marquette. This movie does earn it's R rating."

This film looks at the point of view of the outsider, there's something almost indulgent about the way the popular girl is hounded. The film is very relevant in today's society, where a bully can torment a victim in anonymity, but here there is a twist, Laura is far from a bully, she's the victim, the 'pseudo' victim is the bully.Well acted, neat production values, I wasn't expecting much, but this was very good. 7/10"
" Paranormal Social Media
",0.0,-0.3845,2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,"I think I should begin this post with how I even came across this movie.I went to see Unfriended: Dark Web in the theater--terrible movie. I found out from a review of that terrible movie that it was actually a sequel to Unfriended and that Unfriended was better. OK. Let me watch the first movie in the series, maybe I'll like it. In my Netflix search for Unfriended, Friend Request came up. Sure, I'll watch Friend Request. Friend Request was definitely better. The main character, Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey), is a nice popular girl on campus and has well over 800 Facebook friends (bleh). Sorry, that was me throwing up at the thought of Facebook ""friends"". She's approached by a goth-looking introvert named Marina (Liesl Ahlers) who'd like to be friended on Facebook by the effervescent Laura. Laura complies and shortly finds out that Marina might not be the sanest girl to friend in any context--even cyber-friending.The movie was ""when the paranormal infiltrates tech"". This is nothing new but this is social media based. Ultimately, this movie is about young, pretty, nubile college students being killed--you know, like most scary movies. There are a few jump scares and then there is the shocking. The value in the movie is the creativity and creepiness of the few specters shown as well as the mode of death of those who were killed. Some of the deaths were lame and others were cool (in a horror movie way). Considering that most scary movies are awful I'd say that overall this was OK."
" Creepy, Yet Just Missed Its Mark
",-0.296,-0.9903,2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"This was a pretty good horror flick, but as the case with most horror movies on IMDB, it's rated far lower than it should be. I came into this movie with low expectations, expecting something very silly that's trying too hard to be scary (considering the social media theme), but that was not the case. This movie had genuinely creepy, skin-crawling visuals and a pretty good mystery of a plot going into the backstory of the killer. Although the scariest aspect of the movie was not the visuals, but rather the trapped, helpless feeling of being forced to post disturbing things to your social media and being unable to stop it. It's the modern nightmare. A tainted social image that ruins your goals, dreams, and relationships is terrifying and I almost wish the movie focused on that rather than piecing together the life of the killer. If the killer's life was more of a mystery and the movie was a Black Mirror-esque commentary on the potential dangers of social media, that would've turned a good horror film into a great one."

It stars Alycia Debnam-Carey, of FEAR THE WALKING DEAD fame, playing another gormless and pouty character as unsympathetic as they come. The Facebook-focused storyline is about a malignant friend whose suicide begins a plot of murderous revenge, but it's all done in a cheap, digital style which makes it horrible to watch. Pity poor old William Moseley, who went from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA to this tedious addition to the wave of Internet horror flicks that they never should have bothered making."

The first part of the movie where she is stalking Laura, is excellently done! It's actually very creepy and kind of disturbing. I would have easily given it 7/8 stars.

It proved my first instinct that this would be a dumb movie.I wish they kept it more of a creepy, disturbing, stalker movie. It would have been much better.

As a college student, I would know that your professor WILL NOT tell you in class that a fellow student died. Your campus email will get something saying something about a student dying and when memorial situations will be held.
That's not the only unrealistic thing about this movie. The character relations are just so bland and robotic. There's nothing to say that these people are actually friends because their conversations feel obviously scripted. Let's not even get started on Marina. Or should I say ""petty"". Seriously? The girl decides to ruin another girl's life because girl B didn't invite girl A to her birthday party. Wow. First rule of college, don't go friending someone that already has a group of friends! They're NOT going to spend so much time with YOU because YOU want to be THEIR friend. You have to friend her and her friends and just get into the group. What you DON'T do, is do what Marina did in this movie.EVERYTHING about this movie is unrealistic. Nothing feels right in terms of fiction. I wanted to watch an interesting movie, but this was just a teen slasher that has teens yawning.

" Realistic social media aspect
",0.0,0.9176,2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this. So without further ado, let's get into it.Pros: The film is genuinely engaging. I did not feel bored or annoyed at all during the duration of this film and I honestly expected to.
Gorgeous cinematography. The camera work deserves a better film to go along with it so whoever that was, kudos.
Oh yeah, um also I have huge crush on Kobe.Cons: I feel like they could have delved more into the first part, perhaps made that around half of the film. The initial story has a lot of material that could have been looked into more and would have made the plot more interesting. Sadly it devolved into formulaic slasher mode.
The jump scares and scary imagery are not well used. I could have done without them.Overall I think this film is a lot better than most of the 'social media slashers' that have been coming out. I really like the idea of incorporating social media into the modern horror tropes because I think it can help contextualize the story and help people of my age and younger relate to these films, which in turn makes them that much scarier- but sadly a lot of the movies that attempt to do this just end up using the social media aspect as a gimmick, or the tech aspect is highly unrealistic due to using imaginary sites or programs that aren't even halfway believable. Luckily this one delivered a genuine and normal portrayal of the programs and websites people use."

If not, here's a quick synopsis, with a major spoiler. Laura, a popular student, who apparently is attempting to garner as many Facebook type friends as possible, befriends a sad lonely girl she notices who is eating alone in the cafeteria. The girl, Isabel, has no friends on her Facebook site. BIG mistake! I won't go into the gory details; suffice it to say ALL of Laura's close friends die horrible deaths. And at the end, you guessed it, Laura is sitting alone in the cafeteria, with no friends on her Facebook page. I smell a sequel brewing. One interesting fact that has nothing to do with the story...I tried to place the (California?) beach town where the story takes place. It turns out the flick was filmed in Capetown, South Africa!"

I know a lot of horror movies have the slow parts that add details and then a shocker at the end that puts the pretty bow on the building plot line, however, this movie was too predictable. 35 mins into the movies I accurately guessed the end which also stucks because I didn't even like the villain even though I knew her background. Her punishment to these people in no way added up to what they did. I may be a bit of a ""horror movies snob"" but I will say this movie, if tweaked properly, has the potential to be awesome."

The plot was interesting but it just turns into any other ""horror"" film that has anything to do with social media.

I really was impressed on how the lone girl, Marina, was so creepy. That girl we all saw in high school with black lipstick with one or no friends. She just has to be different and fight the norm. Yeah, we get it. It was the same frame of horror story though. A group of teens get caught up in a curse and they have to dig into the reason this is happening to them so they can find some way to break free from it. Typical. But, like I said...it wasn't terrible. Kept my interest...only wanted to see how it ended. Being a horror movie...badly of course. If you're bored and you have the time, watch it. It won't kill you.

It does have moments which will give you goosebumps n scare and it also manages to involve you by creating a terrified atmosphere which is able to petrify you.
But it fails to meet your expectations as it slips further in second half and climax is certainly weak.

It was written by Verhoeven, Matthew Ballen and Philip Koch. The movie tells the story of a popular college student, named Laura, that befriends a lonely girl at her school, named Marina. When Marina starts acting creepy, and obsessive, Laura unfriends her on social media. Then Laura starts being haunted by Marina's ghost, after Marina commits suicide online. The film stars Alycia Debnam-Carey, Liesl Ahlers, William Moseley, Connor Paolo, Brit Morgan, Brooke Markham and Sean Marquette. It's gotten mixed (to negative) reviews from critics, and it's also been a modest hit at the Box Office so far as well. I found it to be slightly amusing, and somewhat well made.Laura (Debnam-Carey) is one of the most popular students at her college, with over 800 Facebook friends. One day she receives a Facebook friend request from a lonely girl at her school, named Marina (Ahlers), who has zero friends on Facebook. Laura is impressed by her artwork, on her Facebook page, and she accepts her friend request. Laura soon regrets doing so though, when Marina starts harassing her and acting obsessive towards her online. Then Marina commits suicide, and posts it on Laura's Facebook page. Laura and her friends are also soon stalked by Marina's ghost, and Laura starts losing Facebook friends because of the bizarre activity. I like B-horror flicks, if they're entertaining and somewhat well made. I'd say this film is both of those things. It also has some interesting commentary on social media, and what it means to be popular (online) these days. I would have liked to have gotten to know the lonely girl a little more though, and it would have been nice if the filmmakers would have included a little more insight into her motivations (for why she was the way she was.) It's definitely not a bad horror flick though, or a waste of time in my opinion. I'd see a sequel even, if it looks somewhat good.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254"

Could it be that Warner fears that America is not Mature enough to Handle The Truth? If so, it's a sad commentary on us, considering that Warner has issued at least 87 cautions against the Mark of the Beast (aka, Social Security Numbers) since the 1930s (you can look up this perhaps partial listing on Wikipedia). Of course, these have all gone mostly unheeded (except for among listeners of a few late-night AM Radio shows such as Coast-to-Coast), and now--thanks to the credit report cartel led by Equifax--ALL of the bank accounts, retirement funds, college savings, and debit cards of We True Blue Loyal Patriotic 99 Per Center Normal Average Progressive Union Label Citizens are totally at the mercy of every Vlad, Ivan, and Igor hacking today in Russia! Here in FRIEND REQUEST, Warner argues that anyone exposed to THE SOCIAL NETWORK (which documents how Facebook was developed as a tool to correlate college coeds with farm animals!) and STILL has any kind of a ""presence"" on the Internet's so-called World Wide Web needs to have their head examined. With FRIEND REQUEST, Warner warns us that SPIDERS always have monopolized Webs, along with killer wasps and wily witches.

" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,0.8815,2017-09-28 00:00:00,3,"It is unfair to expect too much to expect much from Friend Request. Perhaps a few likes, some plus-ones, and a swipe-right are the most we can get from a movie that could have been a fun exploration of loftier themes such as the pervasiveness of social media in our lives, how an always-on society engenders neuroses and a feeling of being alone or uninvited, and how pervasive technology makes stalking and loss of privacy a new baseline of behavior.Then again, the show Black Mirror did all of that, and better. We even get references to actual black mirrors later on in Friend Request, possibly a tip of caps, or a doffing of caps, by the writers and director to the far superior BBC show.It's not all bad. The first hour is an exploration of some of the more serious themes about invasive technology, and this is by far the best integration of Facebook into a movie since The Social Network. It's right up there with Lion and Google Maps.Our villain gets about as much character development as a Candyman or a maguffin. She is a wicked witch and she wears a hoodie to hide her trichotillomania. Who doesn't enjoy a little trichotillomania?We could have had a much better movie by simply swapping out the evilness of the villain and instead made her a sympathetic outsider trying to fit in at a new place and new social scene.At least we don't have to watch a husky kid solve the mystery in a library. Instead, we get to watch a hunky dude at a computer lab."

However, all of the Apple logos are visible on all other products, and later on in the movie, the same girl says ""FaceTime."" There is no explanation for this obvious change of words.

" Forgettable, competent, and a little puzzling
",0.3182,-0.9979,2017-09-26 00:00:00,4,"This was a strange viewing experience for me. I was the only person in my theater - on an opening weekend!The effect of horror when you see it alone, especially in a theater, is that the scares are more effective. The tension isn't shared with an audience.I was moderately pleased with the first chunk of the story, setting up the villain, making her get creepily attached to the heroine, making things uncomfortable. Then the story starts getting progressively weirder, and not in a good way. Lots of spoilers: The villain kills herself in some hanging/setting on fire thing. The villain then somehow is able to manipulate their social network (Facebook, but never called that) in some way, making the heroine post the suicide video. The villain has a goal - to kill off the heroine's close friends, and cause her to lose all her friends (somehow, 860-something Facebook friends are of value).The villain has abilities that never very clearly defined. She's able to control black wasps. She's able to somehow manipulate Facebook. She's able to control people physically, making a character hit himself against a wall repeatedly.The movie hand-waves this off by claiming that her method of death gave her mysterious powers. But this really seems like a strange assortment of abilities.So, a few characters are picked off. The heroine and the remaining friends decide to investigate Samara (I mean, the villain) and discover a mysterious, creepy past, including her time at an orphanage in which she killed a pair of young boys. Yeah, that cliché is repeated. The strange thing is that somehow, our villain makes the apparitions of the young boys appear. Why? Are they actually the spirits of these kids? Why would she keep them around? This is sort of confusing. There is a detail during this sequence that I like. Her mother was severely burned in a fire, and was kept alive long enough to give birth to her. Nice touch.Things wind down to a final confrontation, which is surprisingly dull. Our heroine has no particular plan to defeat her antagonist, but still goes to confront her.The heroine meets the villain, who is a ghost or something. There's a jump scare, and we get an ending where the heroine has taken over the role of the creepy villain.This raises a lot of questions. Did this free the villain? Does it mean that this friendless condition spreads? If so, aren't they friends now, defeating the cycle? If the heroine is now at a new school with a new name, why is she unable to have friends?The message of the movie seems to be ""don't reach out to lonely people, they might kill you.""Aside from that, the movie is competently made. Nothing special. Typical jump scares, no particular tension. And jump scares have got to go. It's a moment of tension, followed by a sense of annoyance. No one leaves these movies thinking they were scary. They leave with their bodies being tricked into thinking it was scary. But the story? I don't know if I'll remember it in another week."

As such, ""Friend Request"" is nearly indistinguishable from whatever horror picture was released last week, and whichever one will be released next week.Critical response has been just short of scathing, with the Rotten Tomatoes website reporting an average approval rating of 20% based on the reviews of 45 critics.Audience response has been more emphatic—distributor Warner Bros.

But after ""Friend Request"" earned only a dismal $750,000 nationally on its opening day, the studio needed to adjust it expectations substantially downward.

" I'd Be More Entertained Watching Garbage Ferment

I didn't know it was opening night either and there were about 6 other people there. I walked in a couple minutes late during the intro sequence and found myself confused as I watched about three to five minutes of Facebook snapshots set to weird pop music. The movie then started, I guess, and that feeling of confusion never subsided. It got right into the plot and completely skipped any character development. I didn't care at all whether the lead character, or any other character in the film for that matter, lived or died. I didn't understand the motivation of the antagonist and it wasn't ever really explained. Apparently she was a witch or something similar and had magical powers for some reason. She wanted to kill all of the main characters friends for no reason other than she felt lonely, I think. I don't even know. The ending was even more jumbled and nonsensical. By the time the credits rolled, nothing was explained whatsoever. This was by far the worst film I've seen in theaters in recent memory. In fact, I don't remember ever seeing anything worse. Spare yourself the pain and save yourself two hours. I'd rather mow the lawn or something than have to sit through Friend Request again."

This is a cheap horror movie-that is about a year old, it was made in 2016-that tries to cash in on the popularity of Facebook and social media status. Alycia is a popular girl on the college campus- she has over 800 friends on-line. Liesl is a new girl that is the exact opposite of Alycia; she is not popular, has no friends and likes the occult. Alycia feels sorry for her and tries to be her friend, both in real life and on-line, but Liesl becomes clingy and goes psycho when Alycia unfriends her. The wrong thing to do to someone that dabbles in witchcraft. Liesl commits suicide in a ritual that causes major problems for Alycia & her friends. Brit and Connor are some of Alycia's friends-Liesl wants to make Alycia friendless-and William is Alycia's boyfriend. It's just not very scary, even though they use the old unexpected jump-at-the-screen trick to try and get a scare from you.

I hope it doesn't get lost in the shuffle between IT and all the highly anticipated upcoming horror movies this fall, because it is really well done. Don't go into this expecting just another teenagers in peril film, because that is not what it is at all. It should also not be unfairly seen as just a knockoff of UNFRIENDED, despite the similar title and superficially similar theme. As much as I like UNFRIENDED, I think this is a better, more subtle movie which works on more than one level. The direction and acting is very good, and the photography is very atmospheric. Although supposedly set it California, this was actually filmed in Cape Town, South Africa by a German production company. I think this helps add an eerie, other worldliness to the movie. There are also some really well done, imaginative computer animation sequences, and I especially liked the musical soundtrack. It is rare that a movie soundtrack stands out to me the first time I see it, but this one does, and it helped add to the atmosphere. The ending theme is really memorable. This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in recent years, and I hope it find an audience."
" Don't let this one get lost in the pile of similarly titled and similarly themed, but inferior movies.
",-0.6369,0.9864,2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"The 2017 horror thriller ""Friend Request"" (R, 1:32) definitely isn't the first movie to mine the ubiquitous, complicated and sometimes dangerous world of social media obsession for thrills and chills – and surely won't be the last – and it isn't even the first to use that title. 2015 and 2013 also gave us features with this exact title (one from the U.S. and one from India), while similar movies came out in 2016 (""Nerve""), 2015 (the very low budget ""#Horror"") and 2014 (an American one called ""Unfriended"" and a Filipino one called ""Unfriend""). And, as if we needed these titles to be any more confusing, 2017's ""Friend Request"" is called ""Unfriend"" in Germany (the country which produced this one – even though it's entirely in English and takes place in the U.S.). Other than the obvious frustration for someone who might want to try to sort these movies out and see one of them, there's the issue of which one(s) might be worthwhile. Having seen most of the U.S. social media movies just mentioned, I'd say this is the best of the bunch.Laura Woodson (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is one of the most popular students at her college, where she's a sophomore psychology student. Laura has lots of online friends (apparently on a version of Facebook) and a bunch of good in-person friends too. Laura lives in an off-campus apartment with Olivia (Britt Morgan), Isabel (Brooke Markham) and Gustavo (Sean Marquette). She's also friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo, from TV's ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Revenge"", here, with his college guy scruff, looking like a young Colin Farrell). He has a big crush on Laura, but she's dating a medical student named Tyler (William Moseley), in whose apartment she often stays overnight. So, with all those friends, what's one more?Marina Mills (Liesl Ahlers) is the local college loner who sits behind Laura and Olivia in psych class, wears a black hoodie and never talks to anyone. When she sends Laura a friend request, Laura looks at her profile, which is listed as Ma Rina. It's full of black- and-white pictures and animated drawings of creepy and disturbing scenes. Laura's friends, looking over her shoulder at her computer screen, think it's all pretty weird, but Laura respects Marina's talent and, being a genuinely nice person, accepts the friend request, which brings Marina's online friend count to ""1"". Marina assumes this virtual friendship to be a real one and pursues it as such, but is soon stalking Laura, both online and in person. Laura gets understandably creeped out and pulls back from Marina, which drives the tortured young woman to kill herself – with her webcam rolling and posting the video to the college's website. (By the way, that's not a spoiler. The suicide is in the movie's trailers and the incident is revealed very early in the film.)This is when things really get scary for Laura. The video of Marina's suicide shows up on Laura's page – and she can't delete it. Laura tries to delete her account, but that doesn't work either. Laura begins to lose friends – at an alarming rate – online and in person. Then ""Ma Rina"" starts becoming online friends with Laura's friends. Increasingly desperate to stop the madness (and to stop the cops from repeatedly bothering her), Laura digs into Marina's past and finds it to be even stranger than she could have imagined. Kobe, who happens to be very smart and a computer whiz, tries to help Laura out and comes to the conclusion that Marina's death wasn't just a suicide, but a ritual rooted in ancient superstition.""Friend Request"" is deeper and scarier than just another story about online weirdness. German director Simon Verhoeven (who also co-wrote the script, along with Matthew Ballen and Philip Koch) gives us a story about online stalking with a supernatural aspect that affects the characters in frightening ways. The online component is the ever- present backdrop for this movie, but the focus is actually on how interactions with this one person affect the lives of everyone involved. Some may see it as a lesson about staying away from people who are ""weird"" or different than us, but it's actually wise to keep our distance from people as dangerous as Marina (but try to get them help). This is a film about social media obsession, personal loneliness, other-worldly forces and more. Some of the acting is shaky, but the script is mostly solid, the visuals are creative, the mood is creepy and the twists are entertaining. ""B+"""

Sadly though, apart from being as predictable as it was, the angle it chose was also quite annoying; most irritating of which being those 2 policeman.

Amidst all this, they still didn't investigate, postulate or try just 1 thing to solve these mysteries/murders.Also, all of Laura's friends just turning their back towards her, was also, peeving, especially from Olivia. Why would anyone willingly post such horrid videos, but constantly keep going back to the very people she's posting them to, in person?! Maybe because her profile had been hacked?! Sure, them not turning their back to her, would actually go against the films very dilemma to begin with, which is; If somebody is on their own, leave them that way, or they will kill anyone you love:-).This film has many flaws, but, as a product, it came out clean, professional and with promise, in regards to the starring cast.

A brief flashback in the beginning, and then comes back to the present with twist and turns in the tale.Largely based on facebook culture of the youngsters and the filmmakers applied the same old horror film formula to the rest. For some viewers it will work, particularly facebook fans, I guess. But this was an average film. Everything was already seen before in different film and you are only seeing it which is associated with social media, that's all.A German film, but made in English language and cast. The actors were decent, but in some case I was not impressed. There were many flaws, but surely they all can be explained where the film did not do that exactly as it should have even stretched further. That's the point, for being too casual, so the film looked like one of those B category horror-thriller from the past. For watching it once, okay. That includes if you have seen the 2014 film or not, because it is completely different and not fresh enough to impress us.4/10"
" Surprisingly good!

When I realized it wasn't, I decided to see it with no expectations at all considering how much I did NOT enjoy Unfriended. Thankfully, this film is not only MUCH better, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The acting was excellent, the story was decent and made sense, and I sympathized with the protagonists and hated the antagonist (which sometimes doesn't happen in horror movies where the lead characters are too stupid to live).By far the best aspect of this film, however, is its soundtrack and graphics. The illustrations were darkly beautiful and the music blended disturbingly well from lighthearted to haunting on the very same track. I highly recommend this film. In fact, make sure you see it with friends. One great side effect is that your social media-dependent friends who see it will be inspired to get off the grid."
