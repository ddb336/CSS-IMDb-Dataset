" Like the book full of lies
",-0.0772,0.8813,2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Just like his book this movie is full of fabrication and lies. You should watch it with a grain of salt and watch as a complete work of fiction!! do not feel like you are watching a based on true story. There's more truth in the movie ""Howard the Duck"" than in ""American Sniper"". Watch for entertainment purposes that is worth it. But I give a rating of 1 because a how much they try to portray it's a true story!"
" A worthy telling, of a note-worthy figure in just one of many, Theatres of War.
",-0.25,-0.8635,2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,"A patriotic American signs up for the SEALS after the 911 atrocity, and becomes a high profile Sniper, serving four tours in Iraq. Though being possessed of traits well suited to his role, the arc of this story speaks to the moral ambiguity of armed conflict, and that this seal's training had not prepared him for what it would take to survive the emotional and existential crisis that accompany this role. Director, Clint Eastwood, widens the narrative of conflict, beyond simply the good guys and bad guys, and does succeed in delivering a thought provoking story; based somewhat on the story of Seal Sniper Chris Kyle. That being said; the more full and objective story of Chris Kyle may be far more complex and difficult to package and portray. This is none-the-less a worthy telling, of a note-worthy figure in just one of many, Theatres of War."
" Aim your expectations low
",-0.2732,-0.9869,2021-03-11 00:00:00,5,I have never really had any interest in modern day war films especially one's that focus on a single character's story. American Sniper (2014) is exactly that kind of film. The film is based on real life Navy Seal Sniper. Chris Kyle. Before watching this movie I had no idea that it was supposed to be based on a true story.I personally found American Sniper to be a very particular kind of war film. One that is catered more towards Patriotic Americans than it is for a wider audience. I personally know nothing about the US Navy Seals mainly because I'm British. This film is about one American soldier who is pretty much treated like a god because he killed so many people during the war. I appreciate the story the filmmakers were trying to tell of a man who sacrificed a lot for his country and was changed forever by a horrific war. But sadly the film just doesn't come across that way it focuses too much on who has the highest kill count than it does the harsh reality of war on both sides not just the allies side.The acting is fine Bradley Cooper gives a decent performance and the film is definitely well directed by director Clint Eastwood. Sadly this film just didn't interest in the same way as classic war films like Saving Private Ryan. If you have little interest in war movies especially one's that focus more on violence and action than storytelling then I wouldn't recommend watching American Sniper (2014).
" American Sniper (2014, Clint Eastwood) Flawed biopic wrapped too heavily in American exceptionalism
",0.0,-0.2104,2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"American Sniper (2014, Clint Eastwood)
How does one sit down and truly measure this film especially when it so clearly hinges upon the life and actions of one of our nation's elite SEAL members embroiled in one of the most controversial military actions our nation has ever been a part of. I want to try to give a decent analysis of the film on it's own merits but also speak to the merits of Chris Kyle's story as a whole. This story more than any I've seen in recent memory drums up strong feelings both in favor of Chris Kyle and his actions and those against for various reasons. Like most things in this world and most people who take up on either side of any issue the answer truly lies somewhere in the middle. As proud Americans we like to believe in right and wrong and good and evil simple as that. We like to believe simply and without equivocation that there is evil out there that would threaten us and we can just as simply root it out and destroy it if our will is strong enough. The world, however, doesn't exist that way. There is a lot of gray in between the black and white. I digress somewhat and mainly because so many people have weighed in on this movie. So with that preamble laid down let's actually discuss the film. In this film we are presented with the story of Chris Kyle who is America's most lethal sniper with 160 confirmed kills and who's actual kills probably range in the 200-300 range. From director Clint Eastwood this story is adapted from Kyle's wildly popular book of the same title. We are introduced to Chris as an average American country boy raised with religion and hunting which are ingrained ways of life in many of the rural areas of our country. In one of the most resonating anecdotes of the film Chris' father talks about wolves, sheep and sheepdogs in distinguishing types of people basically as predators, prey and protectors and from the start we know which Chris is designed to be. After a failed stint as a cowboy he ends up joining the Navy SEALs seemingly after being prompted to it by terrorist action which works in the film to fan the flames of his patriotic figure. Not much is discussed here about the nature of the Iraq War and because that is not an issue in the film I don't want to go very far down the road of Iraq War politics because it isn't relevant to the telling of this story and is a quagmire in any case. Chris serves four tours in Iraq as a SEAL sniper. Eastwood stages some realistic, tense firefights in the Iraq scenes as well as concentrating on some of the more seemingly moral dilemmas faced by Kyle such as whether or not to kill a woman and child who are running toward a US military convoy with what may or may not be a grenade. It works to great effect that at least in the film we never see him make a misstep in these instances. He kills the woman and child who are revealed to be carrying a grenade and then stays his hand as a boy picks up a rocket launcher but then at the last second drops it and runs away. In an effort to make Chris' and by extension America's purpose very black and white in this film Eastwood sets up some antagonists for Chris to battle against which take the form of a man known as the Butcher and also a Syrian sniper named Mustafa. Eastwood sets up and executes that battle so clearly that literally after felling Mustafa who seems to be Kyle's equal on the enemy side Chris calls his wife and says his time is done and he wishes to come home. This puts out the perception that facing a crumbling marriage Kyle continues to return to action prompted by a very specific enemy. With that enemy vanquished he is free to return to his family and a normal life. Interspersed with the Iraq sequences are sequences of Chris at home between tours. He is portrayed as a reluctant hero, which is truly how we enjoy our heroes, as well as a man haunted. We assume the haunt is some form of PTSD as he grapples back in the real world over life and death decisions he made. All along the way the gruff straightforward performance from Bradley Cooper keeps Chris on his virtuous path. When confronted by his wife he reaffirms that his rationale for going is he can save American lives which is true but probably not the whole truth. Perhaps being the best sniper he feels like sending lesser individuals not up to the task is unacceptable. Whether or not Chris suffered from PTSD he seemed to find a path after his military service days by working with other veterans. Ironically and tragically it was one of these veterans that fatally shot Chris in 2013. I understand quite fully that dramatic license must be taken when adapting true life events to ensure the story flows and maintains interest. This brings up interesting topics in the Chris Kyle story because so much of the story is contingent about how he is presented as a man and an American and a patriot. If you took away the true life nature of the film and also the tragic consequence his death I don't think this film would be garnering near the attention that it has been. The war scenes are tense and dramatic but nothing overwhelming and I've seen better over the past few years. It could have entered more elevated terrain had it dealt more fully with some of the family issues they alluded to at home but once again that wasn't the story that Eastwood wanted to tell. Most notable for me about Kyle's story on film is how events were deliberately manipulated to elicit the maximum patriotic effect and response. Let me say that I believe SEAL training is just about the hardest endeavor on the planet and the men who serve in the special warfare capacity are without a doubt heroes and Kyle is no exception. He served his country bravely and rightly deserves the moniker of hero. I worry that the story as presented on screen serves up a man that is served up as a comic book hero and not presented as the full measure of a man. He is depicted as the ultimate patriot with little to no human failings and as a result when the film ends with his death we are left stricken and dumbfounded. At the very least he was much more eager to kill the enemy than the film portrayed and from Kyle's own lips he claimed it was fun to kill them and if not for his family he would have never stopped doing it. Also there has been articles that have discussed Kyle's tendency to embellish as well as a lawsuit won against Kyle by Jesse Ventura which found that Kyle fabricated an encounter he had with the former Minnesota governor. I say none of this to disparage Chris Kyle nor do I attempt to tarnish his legacy. We are human beings and we have failings. While this is a decent film that's elevated due to the fact that it's based on Kyle's life as a U.S. sniper it could have done Kyle and itself more of a service by exploring more of the truth of the man in war and at home rather than painting him in these broad Captain America brushstrokes which garnered the expected rousing patriotic response in a great deal of the populace.

" Such an amazing, heart breaking and awe-inspiring film
",0.5859,0.9771,2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this film many times over the years, and it gets me every time. Knowing friends who have served, this is a realistic view of what our loved ones have gone through. This might have deviated slightly for Hollywood reasons, but a hell of a lot of it is true.Having grown up with Bradley Cooper in films like the Hangover, he really came into his own in roles such as this and Silver Linings Play Book, and shows what an amazing actor and diverse actor he is. He is absolutely brilliant in this role, and I'm always amazed at how he bulked up and mimicked Chris Kyle so well.Such an amazing, heart breaking and awe-inspiring film.

I may truly call this a perfect piece of propaganda. And even more so because it's not even historically accurate and distorted. US invaded Iraq fighting Saddam's army, not some Alqaeda terrorists, claiming he had chemical weapons which were never to be found. It was all about exploiting oil and other riches of those people whom this movie depicts as terrorists. Those people would never 'attack Atlanta or New York' in a thousand years.

" Delta Force with better production values
",0.6808,-0.9948,2021-01-17 00:00:00,3,"What a terribly frustrating film. Here we have an elite American soldier who has headed out to Iraq, peered down a scope for days on end, and chosen 200 times that the unfortunate at the other end needed to die. A difficult subject deserving a nuanced treatment.The problem is that apart from some sighing and bowing of his head from time to time, Kyle seems unaffected by what he does, as is presumably essential to do this kind of work and not go insane. We have no idea about his character. So with the protagonist essentially a killing robot, it's left to the screenwriter and director to try to inject some depth, and there's plenty not go at.Why is he here? How is Iraq at fault for the embassy bombings and 9/11 which prompted him to march into the recruitment office? What's prompted a woman to push a grenade into her son's hands and send him off to run at a 50 tonne tank? Why have some of the residents of these towns decided to stay and have their front doors kicked in by Marines or have their kids' limbs drilled to dust by the local militant sadist?But these are difficult questions, and there's no apparent appetite to touch on them.As pointed out by another reviewer, this is doubly depressing when you consider that this director produced one of the most harrowing shooting scene in any film, in ""Unforgiven"", where we hear a man die slowly over minutes while his killer agonises at his dying sobbing.Finally, I didn't need to see Kyle get shot at the end, so have no qualms with the choice to show this as a sober piece of text. The fact that we've just seen dozens of people being wiped out through Kyle's scope does however leave me wondering if some of his victims' deaths might also deserve a more downbeat depiction.So we're left with the tired old Stars and Stripes formula that's worked since time began. Western forces mowing down hordes of middle easterners. No doubt, this film needed to appeal to a certain home audience. As far as that's concerned, job done. I'm off for a shower to rinse off the jingoism."

" About what war does to us
",-0.5994,0.9923,2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"American Sniper, directed by Clint Eastwood, tells the story of Chris Kyle, one of the most decorated, talented and deadliest snipers in the history of USA. Based on a real life person, who served four tours in the Iraq War, played in this movie by Bradley Cooper, who's rapidly becoming one of the best drama actors currently working in Hollywood.Eastwood has enjoyed a lot of success as a director, and while I don't think this is quite his best work - Gran Torino being tough to beat - I certainly do think that it's a marvelous piece of entertainment and a haunting meditation on the horrors of war and what it truly means to serve. I especially like how the film doesn't shy away from the fact that Kyle's success in Iraq is directly proportional to his suffering on the home soil. It's hard to be the perfect soldier and then be expected to turn off your killer instinct the minute you step from the plane.It's also a very good film on the technical side of things. From Eastwood's directing to the set designs to the brilliant sound effects brought to life by Alan Robert Murray and Bub Asman, for which they won an Academy Award. When the bullets are flying and your death can come from any direction imaginable, you'll really feel like you're there.I also have to give special mention to the ending. Such a gut punch, and in a way you don't see coming. My heart goes out to the real Kyle family and the struggles they have gone through.Very good film. Among the best war movies ever made. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre."

American Sniper is easily beaten by Jarhead in which the same themes are present but are much better developped and does not forget to show the surealistic uselesness of this war.

" Not suitable for non-American audience
",0.0,-0.9914,2020-11-13 00:00:00,1,"This film is a straightforward glorification of an American soldier, who did not feel even the remotest compunction in taking the lives of approximately 160 men, women and children. In a war that, for non Americans, is overtly illegal and immoral, to me the character of the sniper is no less than repulsive. To Bradley Cooper, who produced this piece of propaganda and to Clint Eastwood, who directed it, Chris Kyle is a hero.
Kyle defends the ""heroic"" marines, who roll their destructive war machine over a third world country. When even a child picks up an arm to stop the marines from destroying everything that is dear to him, Kyle kills the boy, without literally blinking an eye. It is disgusting.Iraqis are depicted as ""savages"" (sic) instead of what they are: a hopeless people, desperately trying to defend their country, with the limited means they have, against a brutal foreign invader.
The film was shot in 2014, 11 years after the invasion and it saddens me to see that even after a decade not even slightest nuance or ""two-sidedness"" can be detected.
The closing shot of Kyle's funeral, with the miles of star-striped salutes to the serial killer, made me want to throw up. It convinced me that Americans need a planet of their own. Unfortunately, that is what they believe too."

" American Sniper, an unforgettable war movie with a phenomenal performance from Bradley Cooper
",-0.5994,0.9989,2020-10-19 00:00:00,10,"American Sniper is a movie I can see over and over again as it is a very enjoyable, emotional and overall incredible film. Clint Eastwood served as both director and producer to the movie and Jason Hall wrote the screenplay, but it's based on Chris Kyle's memoir. The movie is about Chris Kyle and we get to witness a lot of his life as the deadliest marksman in U.S. military history but also his life back home and his struggles. It's a very emotional film and experience, it's so well acted and combine that with the direction and script it brings justice to the characters.There's some beautiful cinematography and camera work in this film, so many talented people worked on this project.
The action sequences were top notch, each had realism to it. The sound mixing and sound editing is a large part to why it sounded real but how it felt real was because of the Navy SEAL training the actors had to through plus the costume and prop department.Bradley Cooper got nominated an Oscar for his performance as Chris Kyle and he should have won, it's such a beautiful and powerful performance that you can watch over and over again. He's one of many highlights of the movie as he is Chris Kyle, maybe not a 100% accurate Chris but he captures the PTSD and the essence of him. Bradley goes through so many stages across the movie of his character, that's Oscar worthy.
Sienna Miller portrayed Taya Kyle and she did a great job, not on the same level as Bradley Cooper but for a supporting role it was strong and overall great. The rest of the ensemble did a great job.The movie got nominated for six oscars and won one for best sound editing, whilst I agree on that I think it should have won in best sound mixing and best actor, strong candidate for best picture and screenplay in my opinion. This is truly a suspenseful and emotional story that captures the horrors of war. I also want to say that I watch movies and rate them of the filmmaking and how enjoyable a movie can be so not for the political views as I don't know if everything is 100% true. American Sniper is a war movie and biopic you will never forget, and one that I will personally never get tired of."

" American Sniper
",0.0,-0.9943,2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"In the film ""American Sniper,"" the protagonist Chris Kyle played by ""Bradley Cooper,"" is a marksman for the United States Navy Seals. Told as a true story, Chris, throughout the Movie, goes through different scenarios that test his concentration and will power throughout the war and his life after. As a marksman, Chris's experience started when he was younger, as his dad taught a lot about hunting. During the film, Chris has to struggle with certain situations on his tours in Iraq and as a husband to Taya, played by Sienna Miller, a father and a person put back in society after and during the horrific event in Iraq. Also, Chris has to deal with PTSD as an expert sniper who had to use lethal warfare against his enemies. In fact, many of Chris's battle allies' lives were in his hands at certain times throughout the film, and that's why the audience can see that Chris had a lot of pressure on himself because he felt the world was on his shoulders.Next, It's important to realize that ""American Sniper"" isn't only a film describing the events in Iraq during the early 2000s. The Film is a true story about the struggles of Chris Kyle, as stated before. Mainly, one thing that should be considered from this film is that you may never know how much soldiers go through in their life and what effects it can have on them mentally after the war. We are lucky that we get to go home to our families every night, but if it wasn't for our United States soldiers defending our nation and what we stand for, we wouldn't have that freedom. Regarding the film, Chris Kyle had to give up many of his privileges physically and mentally, as he is trapped in the thoughts of the previous events that happened on his tour. The scene in their daughter ""McKenna's"" room demonstrates that Chris has to leave his kids and his wife behind, causing him emotional distress because he has to go back and fight while he doesn't even know whether he will survive or not to see his family. Another element about the scene is how Bradley Cooper's role gained the viewers' attention by his vocal tone and body language, showing Chris's reaction when Taya says, ""I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back."" As the viewer, you can tell that Chris's situation isn't easy to forget, and after this scene, the viewer gets what the film could be portraying.In reference to the film ""American Sniper,"" a similar theme is executed in the movie ""The Hurt locker"" because of it's similarities in warfare situations in Iraq. Like ""American Sniper,"" a Sergeant soldier named ""JT Sanborn"" and his comrades must protect their team but does so in specializing in disarming bombs since he is in The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team. Like ""American Sniper"" shows how much soldiers go through during the war, affecting them emotionally and physically. Although the Movie is more warfare focused, it shares it's similarities with warfare scenarios and the soldier's life during the war.Continuing with the Movie Review, it's important to state some of the Filming techniques used in the film. Moreover, the film contains many different techniques that can't all be discussed in a single review, but I will talk about a couple. In particular, one scene uses lighting as it's the stronghold, and that would be during the warfare scene in the beginning specifically. The scene's lighting could be described as gloomy, even though the location is shot in daylight. The lighting technique used is to show the darkness revolving the events that took place during the war. Importantly, this lightning signifies to the audience that something terrible is to occur in the scene, and it intensifies the scenario. This gloominess relates to the theme by symbolizing the pressure soldiers go through. For us, the weather might matter, but when there is a war to be fought, the weather isn't a concern. For soldiers, it can be blue skies and butterflies, but death is inevitable. The lighting in the scene reminds us that soldiers go through a lot and its effects on them mentally. Another technique I want to talk about is the Angling used in the night shoot out scene. The Angling for this scene, paired with the night's darkness, demonstrates Chris's movement, marksmanship, and fearlessness. The Angling and the activity let us, as the viewer, see the mentality and concentration that Chris has. This scene and its execution with Angling reinforce the theme by letting us know that soldiers always have to stay cautious. The reason soldiers develop PTSD is to let us know that we are fortunate, not having to deal with that situation.All in all, The Movie demonstrates a variety of thematic elements. Still, most importantly, it shows how much soldiers go through during the war, and how it takes effect upon their relationships and their everyday life in society. Chris had to go through many things during his tours, and that's what changed him forever. Chris knew he was a warrior, but his actions and the events in the film shaped the man he was before he passed.

" Wonderful Film
",0.5719,0.9375,2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"American Sniper is a dramatic true story, about a man named Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) who is a sniper on a Navy SEALS team. He has a wife Taya Kyle (Sienna Miller) whom he met at a bar after he witnessed another man's poor pickup line and charmed her into doing some shots with him. At this point in the movie, Chris is very excited to have just completed his SEALs training and to be serving his country, something he will always love. He is about to set out on a rocky journey to be the true American hero he eventually became.Over the course of his time as a SEAL, Chris serves multiple tours overseas and makes a pretty good name for himself. The camaraderie he encounters as a SEAL is so strong, combined with the satisfaction he gets from serving his country - he is very torn when it comes to being with his family versus being overseas in harm's way. This is something Taya struggles with for the duration of his service.Whenever the film is showing us, Chris, in a deployed environment, the lighting is spot on. They capture the dull overly bright and extreme sun exposure that I have personally experienced being deployed to the middle east. Even their uniforms look washed out and pale from sun exposure and constant wear and tear. The cinematographer also did a phenomenal job at capturing the points of view when the sniper is aiming his weapon down from a rooftop. I think the capturing of the true points of view was due to realistic angles when shooting this film. I have watched multiple films with similar storylines that are also ""war drama"" and I would have to say the film American Sniper's tempo and the theme are very similar to the movie 13 Hours.He protected Americans when he was serving in the Navy, and after overcoming his struggles after he separated - he continued to help others by working with PTSD victims, which is what led to his death because he was murdered by a veteran he was on a shooting range.Overall, I think this film does a fantastic job of keeping the emotions flowing. There are several changes in emotions, from excited to on edge to just flat out sad. The character's emotions radiate off the screen and into the viewers on conscious flawlessly. I would say the drama presented in this film keeps you on the edge of your seat, while also fighting back tears at the same time."

I went in with low expectations and was surprised how shoddy and stupid it was.. It was a very exaggerated and dumb movie. I am sure they are showing this in stupid countries like Iraq, Israel and Saudi Arabia to prove the point that Americans are living in fantasy land and have to lie and exaggerate to make themselves look good."
" I love this movie! It was very tough in some places to watch but it was great! No regrets seeing it!
",0.569,-0.9703,2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"The movie involves an ordinary man who was raised to stand up for himself and his family, look to shoot for hunting when he was a young boy. This ordinary man, Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle, serves 10 years in the Navy Seals on and off tour while raising his family and managing the ugliness of his work and the lonliness he feels when he's overseas. He suffers a great deal from PTSD as a result of the difficult decisions he made on a daily basis when he determines through a sniper scope who's a threat, man, woman or child. Each time I watched a sniper scene I found myself thinking what I would do if I had the same guts, talents, and wisdom this man had and I was in that situation, juggling all those instincts a human being faced with life and death, right and wrong decisions has to endure. Those scenes were very tense and I applaud Clint Eastwood, director/actor extraordinaire for not rushing it, adding delay to each killing or pull back and view from the sniper scope while Chief Petty Officer Kyle determines whether he is justified in killing the person through the scope indiscriminately, no matter how dreadful it goes against human instinct.There's nothing about the movie I deem unrealistic. It's saturated in violence and some grisly imagery, but the average person can manage it. There's a dozen movies of war far worse than this.The main character, Chris Kyle, is not a perfect person as shown in the movie and does make several mistakes, which showcase this. Great acting by Bradley Cooper in that role. It's definitely a challenge for anyone to play a grisly bear character with a heart of gold who's haunted by the war he endured.Overall, great film!"

" The american hero
",0.5574,0.3182,2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"Clint Eastwood has always expressed his devotion to his country, but probably where it becomes most evident is in 'American Sniper'.
The film tells the story of Chris Kyle, who was one of the best snipers in the history of the United States, standing out in the war against Iran. From this point on, the plot uses two narrative channels, one to tell the events of war and the other that shows the life of Chris Kyle with his family and the consequences of having been in a war. The first of these two narrative branches works flawlessly, with Eastwood even using western resources to recount the war. However, the other narrative path feels weaker in comparison. Probably because the topics displayed on screen do not have the necessary weight in the story or are treated in a slight way.
This film, like the latest by Clint Eastwood, aims to show the American hero in his purest state. He bets it all on leaving aside some themes that could have been better developed and that Eastwood himself has shown in other films of his filmography that he can do better."

Apart from the (mostly) aesthetic cinematography and a good lead actor, this movie is just a 2 hour advertisement to get weak people enlist in the military.There's no morale to the story, no justification, just war. And they don't even hide it: some redneck watches stuff about terrorists on TV and decides to go to the military, to defend his country half around the globe (good ol' American logic, eh).If you want a good war (or better, anti-war) movie go watch FMJ or Platoon.

" Easy to admire on a technical level, but deeply troubling as a historical account
",-0.4921,0.8806,2020-05-31 00:00:00,4,"This film has good cinematography, sound, and a committed performance by Cooper, and other characters. What's wrong is the screenplay. Very, very wrong.I read Chris Kyle's book, and he was far from a pleasant character, however good he might have been with a rifle. A quasi-sainthood with which this film heaps on Kyle (the closing credits are disturbing to see, in this regard) with PTSD unsurprisingly put as the sole demon that interferes with that sainthood. This does huge disservice to how borderline psychopathic and jingoistic the real Kyle was to the people of the Middle East. Which you can read all about in his own text. You get none of that explored in any depth here. Because that would be 'anti-American' of course.Eastwood also ought to know better as a director than to just present this Iraqi conflict as a pro American flag waving, us versus them, 'makes up for 9/11' quest. But that's what it is. The only moral questions that we're presented with are Kyle's fears about shooting children, what his work does in taking him away from his family in America, or how he balances his home life on return with helping out other vets. Little else. Nothing on the devastating bloodshed inflicted on the Middle East by the West, at least partly in the names of oil and opium.You might feel moved by watching this, but you realise soon after that you've been had, if you're politically informed in any way. I don't recommend this film, and I'm glad I never paid money to see it at the cinema, or buying on video at least."

A good film is one that is constantly changing, intelligent and open to the audience. ""American sniper"" is a meditation on war, based on rare sympathy. The film itself is parochial, but it resonates deeply and depressingly with the audience. The war scenes are well-paced and harrowing, and like 2008's the hurt locker, the film is both a patriotic tribute and a stridently anti-war film. Either way, it tells a powerful, moving and tragic tale."

Hollywood changes real stories a lot in many films. They could've changed this one to a good ending and release a book or something that has the real story. Or do any other options that they've done before for many other movies.Obviously Its not a 10 cuz
he died in the end. So this makes a bad ending which i despise in films. And see it as a waste of time. 2 points are deducted because of how much I hate bad endings.Some of his friends died.Chris said. God,Country,family. But he acts like if it was god, Country."
" A good film about a soldier and the psychological effects of war.
",-0.25,0.9928,2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"This biographical film describes the military trajectory of Chris Kyle, a member of the SEAL's, the US Navy special operations unit, who was considered the most lethal sniper in American history. Over several service commissions in Iraq, he killed about 160 people, always in situations where he protected his own life or that of other American military personnel.Personally, I really liked the film, I think it made a faithful account of the most important events in the life of the person portrayed and used the original material well, present in Kyle's autobiography. It was expertly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was perfectly capable of recreating the dangerous environment of the war, as well as the facts of Kyle's life. Being a film about a soldier more than about war, Eastwood focuses on his character, the portrait he wants to make of a man of integrity, brave, eager to help and make a difference. Eastwood gives us more than enough material to create a strong link between the audience and the main character, and that gives strength and sustains the film until the end. Another thing that the film shows are the psychological wounds that Kyle is having due to the war, to the point of emotionally distancing himself from his family. The film reasonably balances the portrait of a today's ""war hero"" with the intimate account of the secret inner pains and complexes of a man who feels that he has seen evil in its purest form.Bradley Cooper was competent in the task of bringing Chris Kyle to life. As far as I was able to understand in the readings and research I do when I want to see a film I don't know, Cooper got to know Kyle and respected him a lot. It was certainly a project that he did with special commitment and affection, and this was reflected in the quality of his work. Technically, the film is flawless. Good special and sound effects, excellent sets, costumes and touches of authenticity in everything we can see. In addition to this, an excellent soundtrack."

I liked how the movie shows his journey of becoming a marine and his fears and inner conflicts of what to do when he's in sniper possession. From his childhood till the day he was killed helping another veteran. I just wished the scenes where he was with the other veterans were longer so it seems he has been through some sort of ""journey"" and now he is taking care of himself, trying to stay alive and well.

" American Sniper (2014)
",0.0,-0.9511,2020-04-02 00:00:00,6,"Directed by Clint Eastwood. Starring Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Luke Grimes, Jake McDorman, Cory Hardrict, Navid Negahban, Keir O'Donnell, Kevin Lacz, Sam Jaeger, Kyle Gallner. (R)Potent but controversial story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (based on the memoir he wrote with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice), who served four tours of duty in the Iraq War and became the deadliest sharpshooter in the history of the US military. Director Eastwood's patented plain-spoken style may not be the most effective voice for this material, which conveniently smooths over most of the thornier aspects of its protagonist's personality and viewpoint; embellishing or outright manufacturing antagonists may work for the sake of rooting interest during the chaos of modern warfare, but it only serves to stake its flag further in the field of belief that the Iraqi people were one and all enemy ""savages."" Touches on (and glosses over) a number of issues beyond the battlefield, such as the moral quagmire of the Iraq War and the physical debilitation/PTSD suffered by vets returning from war; the most interesting part of the story actually takes place after Kyle comes home from his final tour of duty, but those details are rushed over to get to the awkwardly-assembled but unsettling final day of Kyle's life. The efficient precision of the filmmaking and Cooper's strong central performance are commendable in service of its limited mission statement; blunt as a bullet, but that may be enough for most audiences, who turned the film into a surprise box office smash. Oscar winner for Sound Editing.63/100"

I think that it is a noble idea overall.The only place where this movie is losing points, is that I feel that a certain part of the movie was more concentrated on killing a particular sniper of the enemy, The movie goes a little bit far by making a useless emphases on that aspect of the story.I recommend this movie, it shows us that Clint Eastwood still make good movies, this one was even nominated for an Oscar."

" One of the better Iraq films
",0.4404,-0.8839,2020-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I have always been a bit confused that this film was thought of mere jingoistic propaganda by a certain segment of the left. I understand how that impression could come about because of the ending/credits. The ending is the weakest aspect of the film and much more should have been made of how Kyle died and the credits are pretty overtly chest thumping. The final few minutes greatly simplified the overall film and the principle reason why I can't fully recommend this film. However, everything that occurred before that is pretty darn interesting in how Eastwood and his writer are trying to reconcile competing tensions.There is a troubling ambiguity at the heart of the film about what the film itself thinks of Kyle's military service. He is shown to be reactive and to be blunt not very self-reflective. He ends up joining the military in response to the embassy bombings in 1998. The decision comes across less because of a sense of patriotic duty than because of personal issues he was having on the very night the bombing occurred. In any case it is not a deeply felt ground project of Kyle's. Or how the film's central battle is ultimately ""won"" by Kyle only to have this Pyrrhic victory places his unit in greater danger. The film repeatedly shows the US's actions creating more insurgents. There's even a sarcastic invoking of Bush's ""mission accomplished"" in the film. The domestic scenes-especially in the car dealership-show a man deeply damaged by his experiences and he is largely unable to process it. The film is deeply paradoxical in the way it tries to square disapproval with the war in Iraq while sympathizes with a down to earth guy having the impulse to protect home and kin.I think viewing the film in the larger context of Eastwood's filmography is important. In particular, Unforgiven (in the that essentially peak American genre of Westerns) is a pretty stark condemnation of how violence begets violence. Furthermore, the Eastwood sympathies towards Kyle are pretty much the same sort of sympathy he has had for boots on the ground displayed in Flag of Our Fathers and *critically* Letters from Iwo Jima. The film is fascinating in how it tries to reconcile the various tensions embedded in its narrative.The film is technically stellar. (well fake baby aside) Eastwood continues to be one of the best restrained directors working today. There is a rawness to this film that sells the war scenes. Cooper really gives a fully engaging and heartbreaking performance. This is a film that may be too subtle for its own good."

" The American Sniper
",0.0,0.9932,2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"In the film American Sniper the main summary is about Chris Kyle a sniper for the Navy seals. Chris Kyle is played in the movie by Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper is very well known Actor and plays the role very well. As we get to know some of the back story of the film, Chris Kyle was one of the most deadliest snipers to live. 255 kills but only 160 confirmed. In the beginning of the film Chris is a bronc rider in his mid 20's. He is unsatisfied with what he's doing with his life. Then throughout the movie it shows us how Chris becomes the man he is and was until his death in 2013.
Overall the film is a great way to learn how pressure with PTSD affects many people after and during a war. Chris fought a battle with PTSD when being home from fighting. Many military men have this when they come home. Some can change this but others can't. There are multiple movies based off the war in Iraq, but this one was focused on one main character unlike Zero Dark Thirty and 13 Hours. Both of those films have multiple characters that they tend to focus in on. One thing I saw that was interesting is that Chris was all about going out into a battle unlike other men. Serving his country meant a lot to him and you realize that during the film. Clint Eastwood is known for making great films, going back to old westerns and newer military movies. Clint Eastwood is the perfect director for this film and the film was created in California, along the Malibu shores. Clint made multiple scenes in this film feel special to the actor playing the role of Chris by having the actor feel the same way that Chris felt when it truly happened.
A main scene that I found to be very important and breathtaking is when Chris makes a remarkable sniper shot. Another scene from the film makes you feel the tension between the main character Chris and a little boy. The film makes good transitions from Iraq to back home. Chris's Wife deals with a lot of stress taking care of their 2 kids and the film shows that very well by making us feel what she is feeling. Chris's wife is played by Sienna Miller and her name in the film is Taya. Sienna Miller has been in more than 28 films and American Sniper is her well known film.
Overall, this is a film I recommend especially if you like military movies. Battles in Iraq are very important because we still have troops over there to this day. Clint Eastwood makes great films, this was one of my favorites. Being though this film was based off a true story it makes it come to life even more and makes you feel the way the characters felt in the film."
" Superficial

There is nothing good about a war, and there is no definite good or evil. Although there were extremists in Iraq during the American war there, there were innocent people who were killed, prisoners who were violated and women who were raped, and finally it's the American army that raged a war against Iraq, not the contrary, and Iraq has nothing to blame for the events of 11 september.

This film is in no way shape or form similar and it is completely bizarre for someone else to say it . Bradley Cooper did a fine job playing this role . Chris Kyle was a hero and it's a disgrace to even compare this picture to a fictional movie about killing nazis and a sniper who is also fictional by the way and is portrayed as Fredrick zoller and in basterds it doesn't even show him sniping except in the movie within the movie . Some people need to get their facts straight . Clint Eastwood did a fine job of directing this . This is a great film and I saw it when it first came out . I just recently watched it again. It's a tough film to watch but very necessary. The part when he works with the amputees is very touching. To my knowledge he did this in real life . It sucks the tragedy that some evil would shoot his own fellow military men. The guy who did it should get the death penalty. Plus he shot Chris and his friend in the back like a coward and this dude Ex marine. My grandpa and father both served in the military in the army and the navy . People need to understand that the politics side isn't because of the soilders people need to blame the politicians . My point is I support war veterans adaptation into civilian life . I don't judge them they are just men and women doing what needs to be done .

" Eastwood's fitting and respected tribute to the US military
",0.4767,0.964,2019-11-26 00:00:00,8,"American Sniper follows more than the life and career of Navy Seal Chris Kyle, it examines the Army, Marines, Navy and the Air Force and their involvement in the Battle of Ramadi, Iraq in 2006.Bradley Cooper grows in size and character as he fittingly transforms into the patriotic US Navy Seal Sniper Chris Kyle, showing nothing but grit and tenacity in his role as a Seal and a father, Cooper played this role exceptionally, so much so that I forgot he was acting, the whole movie just felt real in general. Sienna Miller also rises to the occasion as the honest yet loving wife to Kyle, her transformation in personality to when she met Kyle in a bar till minutes before she would see him for the last time forever was at a smooth and appropriate pace.The film does show action and does a fairy good job at it, while not guns-blazing, is honest and simple with sequences such as front door breaches, Kyle's sniping snippets and the occasional Humvee (Vehicular) scenes. There is only one scene in the film where everything is havoc and that occurs right after Kyle snipes and records his longest kill against Mustafa, an Iraqi sniper working with ISIL militants.However, the ending to this film is shocking because it was reality and Eastwood reminded us once more through a fitting and touching tribute about the contributions and tribulations of Chris Kyle. While the film is definitely American propaganda, the notion shouldn't stop us from dissecting and appreciating the cinematic and storytelling prowess of Eastwood showcased here.Whether you're an American or non-American, we can all agree that Chris Kyle has made history for himself and his country and there is no-one who can do justice to his story and legacy other than Clint Eastwood."
" I am foiled Clint, what a contemptuous pulp.
",-0.4939,0.7348,2019-11-22 00:00:00,4,"Indeed, I admire Eastwood, I admire his style and the receptive subjects cuts his teeth on, wether its tackling the affair of class and gender issues in sports (Million Dollar Baby), or humanising the often marred Japanese soldiers who served in WII (Letters from Iwo Jima), exposing the pernicious foundation the western genre relies much of its appeal on (Unforgiven), or addressing the crooked early 20th century criminal justice system (Der fremde Sohn). So what happened?I think a large part of the reason this film felt like such cold utility is its inability to address Weapons of Mass Destruction and George Bush, meaning the constant beating around the bush this film specialises in seems to imply the invasion of Iraq was a just response to 9/11.in the film there is no sub-narrative or extra time spent discussing the American Invasion and Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) fighting in Al Qaeda, which once again gives the impression that the Iraq War was contrary to Al Qaeda at the Outset, accidentally stating that America had invaded Iraq because it had developed into a focal point of Al Qaeda applications. in reality, Al Qaeda and Iraq cultivated outside of the American Invasion.This review was extremely rushed, but I hope it allowed just a bit of insight into my viewing experience. And thank you to Vox for allowing me to check some of my facts. The film was made with good intentions, but it got a bit too attracted and in the end tangled in Chris Kyle's beliefs. All that, and, oh yeah, the fake baby."

" A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
",0.7386,-0.9925,2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"While widespread trail of death, destruction and displacement are the visible effects of war, its real brutality is in the less visible, or often invisible, albeit pronounced effects on the psyche of those who survive. For, it is they who have to live with the scars of war, picking up the shards of their shattered life. As against those who die and are consumed by the war, the survivors face the pain of death on a daily basis as they are relentlessly haunted by their commissions and omissions which could have made a meaningful difference.In American Sniper, veteran director Clint Eastwood narrates the real life story of Chris Kyle (an excellent Bradley Cooper), an ace marksman of the US Navy SEALs, who in his four gruelling missions during the Iraq war, is credited with more than 160 confirmed kills - the highest ever for a sniper. The film is largely set in the wreckage of Iraqi towns where the invading US marines had to engage in deadly urban combat with deadly insurgents from the al-Qaeda. The nature of urban warfare necessitates the services of snipers like Chris Kyle who is perched in a position, far and high from the battleground, keep an eagle eye to protect his mates from any incoming threats.While this setting provides for several thrilling and action packed moments, especially when confronted by an Olympian sniper from the other side, the focus of the film remains firmly on the psychological aspects of the war on Chris - Why he came to be what he is and what is he going through..? Even as he is highly effective in his role as a sniper in the battlefield and is celebrated as ""THE LEGEND"", we find that the war quickly consumes his psyche entirely. He is unable to shift his focus away from it even during his well deserved breaks away from the war zone when he is safely ensconced in the warmth of his home with a loving wife, Taya (an effective Sienna Miller) and his newborn son. The battle continues to rage on in his mind and brings on a firestorm of guilt and helplessness that singes his very soul and almost upends his normal family life which was moving on an even keel. As the distant war continues to cling on to him like an unyielding parasite and can he quell the very real threat it poses to unleash a turbulence on him and his loving family...? Check out the movie to know the answers.Despite being an one-sided narrative which does not care to focus on the other side, Eastwood's movie which has strong resonance with his earlier westerns raises difficult, yet pertinent questions about the whole idea of heroism and violence. And, in a beefed up Bradley Cooper, he has an actor who has embodied the character so deeply with all its vulnerabilities and nuances that makes this movie tick as an almost meditative exploration into the troubled psyche of a celebrated war hero."

" Action, Romance, and Drama all wrapped into one!
",0.5983,0.9714,2019-09-20 00:00:00,9,"American Sniper, a true story, and a realistic war drama, Bradley Cooper's performance is highly captivating and is a spot-on portrayal of Chris Kyle, United States Navy Seal sniper. This film not only has action-packed war scenes but it also offers some romance by letting you take a glimpse of how Chris and his wife, Taya end up together and eventually married.
Along with the action and romance, this film surely doesn't skimp on the drama. During Kyle's 6 tours in Afghanistan, you begin to see the effects that the War has on Chris and his family. This film does a fantastic job showing the audience how a soldier returning home could experience the effects of PTSD and things their families can do and what they can do to get help.
So much of Chris Kyle's life gets packed into 2 hours and 14 minutes but nothing feels underdeveloped or left out of this film. In the dramatic ending of Chris Kyle learning how to cope with his PTSD, he finds comfort in helping other soldiers through their PTSD. Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in American History lived the tell the tale of 6 tours in Afghanistan only to perish at the hand of one of his own. This film is an emotional roller coaster that sadly ends in tears."

" Gritty, Brutal At Times, And Pretty Alright.
",0.0258,0.9476,2019-08-16 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, it's alright.Bradley Cooper's performance is pretty good, the pacing is decent, there are a few nice shots here and there, and a lot of sympathy and attention is given to soldiers and civilians caught within a war zone and the effect it has on their state of mind. It's certainly not a fresh and original take on the trauma of warfare, but it's certainly presented well with decent seemingly realistic gun-play and some very harrowing moments - like seeing a young child and his mother being killed by the protagonist in one of the opening scenes (arguably justifiable in the context of the scene, but nonetheless an intense moment of ethical dilemma). So I think it's fair to say that this film doesn't exactly pull its punches. And while American Sniper comes with a good helping of chest-thumping patriotism, which is to be expected from a Clint Eastwood film, it still does an okay job of at least giving some humanity to the opposing side like showing a picture of the enemy sniper, Mustafa, as a Syrian gold medalist in the past. It's limited, sure, but at least it's there.However, the cinematography isn't all that special, the score is unmemorable, and very few of the characters outside of the few in the main cast have any character development whatsoever, thus the few that die leave barely any emotional impact and the ones that survive are wholly unremarkable. In addition, its realism and accuracy to the real-world events is questionable to say the very least (but again, that's expected with most films like this) and some of the special effects like the helicopter in the sandstorm are quite bad. Not to mention that clearly fake baby doll which everyone has already talked about at great length, so I won't.Overall: 6/10"

" A watchable, competent but morally irresponsible film
",-0.4939,-0.9891,2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Well, I did not want to pay money to see this but saw it last night on ITV (UK).
I am not a Clint hater; I loved Gran Torino and Flags of our Fathers, I even loved Clint's Dirty Harry outings, especially Magnum Force.
American Sniper is watchable competently directed, but I think the writing is pretty below standard, considering the importance of the subject matter. The film worries me as it leaves out important elements if this really supposed to reflect true events. If this was an action flick written as fiction, I would have no problem with it.I have not read Chris Kyle's book, but knowledgeable reviewers have said that it is different from the film and he is far less noble than the film suggests. I also reject the premise that a sniper is a hero. Killing someone from a long way is skilful, not brave. The same goes for drone or apache pilots shooting up some guys with akm's when they don't even see you.Others point to the propaganda in the film, which is obvious. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, yet this is never commented on by the troops. I have known a few guys who were in US army and marines. They are not all dumb robots, they ask questions and would wonder why they were in Iraq. None of this is discussed in the film. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died in Iraq, in suicide bombings, crossfire and US action; none of this is mentioned. A good film gives context; this does not. In his Iwo Jima film, Eastwood shows the humanity of the Japanese, who committed some hideous acts when they invaded China and other Asian countries; where was the empathy for the Iraqis here?I suspect that this film was made with the help of the US military; that would explain the lack of criticism of the US forces or policy. Any film made with military assistance will be biased towards it. This goes for war, action and disaster films. Note that Apocalypse Now was made in the Philippines using Hueys from Marcos' army.Coppola could never have used USA equipment.The shooting of women and children is well directed and not glamourised, but then how could you show it otherwise? I don't know if women and kids actually used weapons like this in the insurgency, but if they did, Coopers portrayal is believable and sympathetic, until the second time he may have to shoot a boy trying to pick up an RPG. Wouldn't a decent Kyle try to scare the boy off with a warning shot instead of waiting for the boy to aim the weapon?One good element is the reference to PTSD, but this more attention. Cooper is brilliant and Miller is believable as his eye-candy wife. I found the sudden end with the lack of dramatisation of Kyle's death a cop-out. The scenes of the funeral procession were also out of tune with the rest of the film, cheesy and playing to naive audiences. I felt guilty for watching this film but cannot deny that it is an engaging story, whatever parts are true."
" Brandley Cooper excellent, Clint Eastwood a briliant director, and a contraversal subject
",0.5719,0.83,2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"First I would like to say few words for the subject.
This movie, like many others, presents the soldiers in a foreigner soil as patriots. When a soldier pass the borderline, the morality stops. And so is not cool, is not nice.
Additionaly soldiers have to deal with metatraumatic syndromes, and other health issues, not to mention the seperation from the family, and the impact to all, especially the children.
All those described in this movie, but I wish in the future remain only in movies.Beyond all the above, Clint Eastwood is an outstanding director, not only to this film. I remeber his youth movies as an actor, and never expect to be a such high quality director.
Bradley Cooper defend his role with top performance. Is hard to believe is him! He is not Brandley Cooper anymore, he is absolutely this soldier, and without overacting.
The scenery is absolutely realistic.Those who like war movies, should put this in their list."

Bradley Cooper could have done much more... as he demonstrated in other movie gems. I really didn't felt his character and couldn't care less for his depicted situation.
The story is pretty simple which leaves plenty of space to develop a deep insight into the inner experience of the hero and his struggle. Instead, we are ""forced"" to watch perfectly filmed soldier actions and waiting for something more.
Where are the feelings, doubts, insane wishes to go back on field and leaving your sweet wife and children?In conclusion: If you liked Black Hawk Down (2001) or The Hurt Locker (2008) then give it a try. I need(ed) something more to persuade me to watch it again."

",0.0,-0.957,2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"Guns, patriotism, war, family, love the list goes on and on, what's not the love about American Sniper! Oh boy, oh boy, I really do not know where to even begin with this movie. It is amazing in so many ways. A memoir-based movie written by the man who lived through it all, Chris Kyle. I read the book a few years back and I was in a trance reading it and I knew I needed to see this on the big screen.
Directors and cast are award-winning stars credited to multiple movies. Director, Clint Eastwood, does a fantastic job tying the true, horrific stories of Chris Kyle to the Hollywood aesthetic of movies. Although not always entirely accurate throughout, man is this one amazing movie to watch. You're constantly on your toes. You want to thank your veterans. Eastwood balanced everything in this movie to a tee. A lot of action but did not shy away from the real world problems of war.
Bradley Cooper. I have no words for this man. He is an incredible actor and this movie is no exception. He portrayed a navy seal that was tough as nails. It would be hard to believe this wasn't just a documentary of Cooper at war. He played the part so well and his emotions captured the realism of war so much. Cooper played the part of Chris Kyle a man that came from nothing but rodeo clowning and drunk fights. He decides to enlist in the armed forces and in due time trains to be a Navy Seal. He quickly climbs the ranks and becomes a eagle-eyed precision sniper. He gets sent overseas to the middle east to fight in the war of terrorism. He records a huge sum of kills and gets all sorts of praise and nicknames. Eventually even receives a hit for his death for a large sum of money. The way Cooper is able to portray the character and the thoughts going on make him more than deserving of the MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance.
One scene stood out above the else highlighting Coopers talent in this movie. He is in the hospital and the doctor asks him a few questions about how many kills he has. He then asks Kyle if he regrets seeing anything. Cooper responds,
""I was just protecting my guys, they were trying to kill... our soldiers and I... I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took""
Chills, chills, chills. This highlights the true aspect of war and why the guys serve, they do it for their buddies and the ones back home. Cooper by far took my spot as my favorite male actor from this performance alone.
All in all this award winning/nominated movie deserves nothing less than what it has received. It is similar to other war movies but Eastwood does one thing to set it apart, highlight the human side of what happens to our soldiers. This movie makes us feel more for our soldiers. It connects us to our country. It is certainly more than just an action movie with a few good explosions."

Mild boredom will still hit here and there, but it's forgivable.
The movie is 100% on the shoulders of Bradley Cooper, and he easly carries the load: though he's a good actor, he did a very remarkable, surprising work here, in what could be his best performance to date."
" Read the Book For the Whole Story
",0.0,-0.8248,2019-02-01 00:00:00,5,"I was disappointed in this movie after reading the book some months earlier. In his autobiography Kyle is unsparing in his self-appraisal. Kyle tells us from the beginning that he is no hero and certainly no role model and proceeds to tell us why in unsettling detail: an extreme alcoholic with a violent temper, borderline abusive husband and initially a neglectful father, saved from jail time by overly indulgent judges, Kyle finds his purpose and a home as a Navy SEAL. Rather than show us the complete man, the movie is more an exercise in hero worship with typical American war heroics more at home in a WWII era film. It would have made a more complete and absorbing movie with a picture of the whole man as Kyle intended for us in his book. He found peace and was restoring the nearly broken relationships with his wife and children at the time of his death which made his death even more poignant.

",0.0,-0.7025,2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,"When it comes to true story films, there are times where film-makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. In this case, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper has already contracted not only positive acclaim but a stir of negativity and controversy that surrounds the way Kyle was really like in life. Some say he had lost his mind in the war for peace while others say he was caught up in the emotional aftermath after service but Eastwood has stated that his film is ""the biggest anti-war statement any film can make,"" and said that ""the fact of what war does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did""What AS tells is the true life figure Chris Kyle who served as the American military's 'lethal sniper' who has made more kills in his duty of tours during the Iraq war period after 9/11. It chronicles how Chris became a true American to protect his homeland and the aftermath of serving his tours when he came home to his small growing family, leading up to the final hours of his life."
" Decent But Missing The Crispness
",-0.4215,-0.9826,2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"18 January 2015. This movie is about Chris Kyle, a real Navy SEAL, who made several tours in the Iraq War and considered the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. What this movie attempts to accomplish apparently is both an action movie and a biographical movie about Chris's wartime experiences and his transformation as a human being as a result on his relationships. While the movie does a decent job with both, it somehow misses the mark.Both Enemy At The Gates (2001) and Spy Game (2001) offer more richness and depth of the sniper experience. In Spy Game, Brad Pitt is trained in the nuances of espionage while in American Sniper, Bradley Cooper, is seen being trained in intense but more basic training. But one would expect to see more specialized training which of SEALs are well known and which supposedly is put into some use later in the movie. There are some questionable decisions or lack of both in strategy and on the ground on the part of the United States military that are explained or complained about in the movie. While there is some rationale for the one-sided portrayal of Americans as the good guys and Iraqi insurgents as the bad guys, Enemy At The Gates seemed more intimate because both Jude Law as a Russian sniper and Ed Harris as a German sniper are presented as human beings with a sort of dignity and code of ethics, who respected each other (of course, in reality it's likely impossible to know how Chris and his arch-enemy felt about each other). Nevertheless, Chris's brother's character seems underdeveloped and possibly of some important value to the story of Chris Kyle which was apparently not incorporated into the movie.As for the cinematography, there is something lacking in the crispness and intimacy of the photography that seems to distance the audience from the action. Such sharp resolution, especially with a biography, is made more potent in such movies as Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Hurt Locker (2008), Jar Head (2005), We Were Soldiers (2002), and even Anglina Jolie's Unbroken (2014). Perhaps, an excellent portrayal of war might to found in the docudrama television mini-series about World War I, The Great War Diary (2014) As for character development, there seems to be something missing here too. Perhaps this is unavoidable, as a military man who experienced several tours of war and Chris's upbringing may have shut off his inner self from the rest of the world, but nevertheless, the intensity found in such characters as Angelina Jolie's performance in Changeling (2008) or Christian Slater's performance in He Was A Quiet Man (2007) is missing.It is understandable why this movie is being nominated for awards, especially due to its relevant subject matter, the impact of war time experience on soldiers, yet even at the end, there seems to be a lack of full awareness and understanding on the part of the audience as to Chris's experience towards life and death."
" A mixed result
",0.0,-0.0799,2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Based on the true story of Chris Kyle, an expert marksman and U.S. Navy Seal, Bradley Cooper portrays the main character who fought in the front lines during the Iraq War.The first half of the movie is seen mainly through Kyle's viewpoint. He is a devout patriot and sees his mission as saving his country and its people. This is a fair viewpoint but the movie avoids the many counter-arguments happening at the time of that very divisive war.The Iraqi people are mainly portrayed as the ""evil bad guys"". None of them has a chance to express their story of how they feel about a foreign military invading their country or how they might feel the need to defend their people as Kyle does about his people.Thankfully, the film doesn't have a totally hawkish viewpoint. It is quite honest in the difficulties faced by soldiers after returning home. For Chris, this is mainly reflected by his wife, played by Sienna Miller, who is clear in her unhappiness about Chris' drive and how he has changed. Though Cooper gives a rather good performance, there could have been more depth and subtlety in the portrayal of someone who is driven while denying the effect of the traumas he has experienced.At times, the film seems too long but it ends with a very moving finale that is felt well after the movie's completion. The ending also centers around an event that boldly and effectively takes place off-screen. - dbamateurcritic"
" The ""Black Hawk Down"" of the decade
",0.0,-0.525,2018-12-28 00:00:00,2,"While I've never been a diehard fan of American gritty war films, or the genre in its entirety, American Sniper is a solid booster to the patriotism injected into movie goers during Black Hawk Down. That same level of intensity and chauvinistic furvor carries here, and Cooper does a fantastic job of portraying the American legend Chris Kyle.The plot draws a beautiful juxtaposing line of life on the battlefield versus life at home. The small details displayed in Kyle's behavior, health, and mannerisms by Cooper start to instill the maxim that maybe the soldier never truly leaves the battlefield, even while embraced in the comfort of his/her living room arm-chair.While the film could retrospectively be brushed off as a popcorn film lacking any sort of depth, I believe American Sniper deserves a place on the pedestal of our minds as a hallmark of what a war film should be and how dramatic events of war time should properly be portrayedOverall I am forced to give this movie a 2/10. I would have given this film a 1/10, but during discussions of the film or the historical events in which it is based, sometimes the word ""guerilla"" is used when describing the fighting style of the enemy soldiers. Sadly this is not the type of gorilla I want to see in cinema. American Sniper totally overlooks the important role most gorillas or other apes play in mainting their respective ecosystems. During their daily movements, the walking styles of most apes actually tills the soil of the forest floor, facilitating aeration of the soil, creating a healthier and more stable container in which rainforest plants or other lowland greens may thrive! This important, understudied, and often overlooked fact is totally disregarded in American Sniper; they don't even know that gorillas are far more important than guerillas."

Eastwood was able to incorporate. As a kid I used to adore Eastwood and his overly *masculine* (judge, jury and executioner) personas in movies. That is not the case anymore. Eastwood has always been a political hard-liner.. on (Firefox) and off the screen. Taking political views into consideration, C. Eastwood and Ch. Heston could've been brothers. I don't know why, but in recent years (and projects) Eastwood has been focusing more than ever on one-sided portrayals of Americans being the heroes. In my humble opinion CHRIS KYLE IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A HERO. A person with so many kills on his belt is A KILLER PURE AND SIMPLE, NOT A HERO.
Also, don't let me get started on B. Cooper. Personally, I think the guy has a terrible vibe. To me he seems incredibly ignorant, arrogant, selfish etc. All in all, just a horrible human being. One of the most unsympathetic people I've ever seen on screen. Enough about Cooper.. he doesn't deserve more of my attention.Let's have a look at CE's last 5 movies..J. Edgar = probably a good portrayal of Hoover, since the guy must've been a complete psychopath. Still one of Eastwood's worst movies.
Jersey Boys = the exception here .. not bad, but not great either
Sully = boring boring boring boring .. only for U.S. audiences. A pilot did his job and landed a plane. Wow. How mesmerising.
15:17 to Paris = one isolated incident turned into something epic .. propaganda in its purest form .. some of it may actually be factual. I'm pretty sure there's been a similar (or even better) story somewhere in history not involving U.S. soldier's on a train. Why not tell that?..and this pile of crap.A couple of questions regarding Hollywood movies/blockbusters:When there's an alien invasion or attack of any kind,why do these events always happen in the U.S. ?
Why is the U.S. always portrayed as the world leader and/or hero in such situations?Furthermore, something to think about:Americans (U.S. citizens especially) are among the dumbest, least educated nations in the world. They may have some of the best schools/universities in the world, but only a small number of the world's population is actually allowed to attend, rendering their over-priced existence insignificant. The *normal* school system over there is horrible. Designed to manipulate more than educate.Nuff said.."

" An Accurate Depiction
",0.0,-0.9232,2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"As a reader of the original autobiography, I was quite thrilled learning that a movie adaptation would be made. First off, the book is absolutely incredible. It gives an incredible good depiction of the reality of war and it's effects.But I'm not here to talk about the book, I'm here to talk about the movie. Honestly the only thing I have to complain is the lack of running time. The whole plot was changed and was focused around an unclear antagonist of an enemy sniper called Mustafa when in the book Mustafa is no real threat. He's only mentioned one or twice in the book.But that isn't the big deal. What makes the movie so great and so successful was it's accurate depiction of who Chris Kyle was. Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller both gives outstanding performances as Chris and Taya Kyle. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the caliber of their acting and just the sort of ethic realism they brought to the characters. Bradley's depiction of Kyle in this film is one of the best feats of acting I've ever seen. You can see the look in his eyes and you can see that that guy is the American Sniper.Acting aside, the plot was somewhat of a slight mess. The movie was focused around non canon events but they made it work in the movie. The lack of runtime certainly took away the completion of Kyle's war story. But that's what the movie intends to deliver. The movie intends to deliver a depiction of who this man was. He didn't kill because he loved killing. He killed so that the savages wouldn't come back to the States and kill his people. He was protecting his buddies, he was protecting his comrades. That's who he was. To him, it didn't matter how many guys or savages he killed. What mattered to him was how many of his guys were killed. Those were the ones that stuck to him and the movie does an incredibly good job of depicting this. I have to say Clint Eastwood, well done on doing the book grace.It's action sequences are gritty and realistic and it's depiction of Iraq is top notch and accurate. Honestly for people who haven't read the book, you have no idea just how more gruesome Iraq actually is then is depicted in the movie."

Bradley Cooper did have a good performance despite the lazy writing. I don't often fall asleep during movies but I did both times watching this. So if you're looking for a movie that really is just another ad for the military complex of America, then check it out! But don't expect anything fantastic, it's a very low 6/10. It would be a 4 if it weren't for addressing mental impacts of war.

Bradley Cooper does a great job losing himself in the role of Chris Kyle - he's almost unrecognizable.

This movie illustrates not only how the locals (in this movie people in Iraq) are suffering from the war but also how American soldiers are. There is s scene that a local boy is carrying ""something"" (a bomb) from a distance and approaching the American army side. And there is an emotional struggle of the sniper whether to take a shot on the child or not. Of course it is not acceptable to shoot a child to death but also he has to save his and other soldiers' lives because they have family too.
This movie describes the complexity of humanity in war; human rights are not to be undermined but some people have to undermine others' to protect their lives.

I took a lot away from watching this movie, since I watched it when I was a little younger and didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, it inspired me to want to be like him. Yet I didn't quite understand why he was named the ""American Sniper"" when that was was supposed to be the best sniper in the world, because the Terrorist sniper, was way too much of competition for him to even hang.

" An American Cowboy Turned to War Hero
",-0.0772,0.6826,2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is about a cowboy that turned into a war veteran legend to protect his country. Bradley Cooper plays as Chris Kyle, a navy seal veteran that is trying to protect his country and his family. The theme of this movie is how Chris Kyle goes through four tours of war overseas and how he changes drastically each deployment. Chris's wife, Taya, is played by Sienna Miller. She notices that Chris is different every time that he comes home. In this biography of a guy's adult life and life during the military you learn a lot about him, a lot about who he is and mostly a lot about what he stands for. 
 There are three main types of theme in this movie. There is Chris's life before Taya and the Military, then Chris's life with Taya while he is home from the military and the final theme is Chris when he is away with the military. In the first part of the movie Chris is a typical rodeo cowboy that rides on the weekends for competition. Then the other two main parts of the movie are intertwined with each other the rest of the movie. First is when Chris is at home with Taya. They are happy before his first tour of duty. Then is when everything started to change between them. After four tours of duty overseas there is a lot of difference. Chris is a different person when he is home because he can't stop thinking about war. He is always spaced out, he tweaks over loud noises and he is over protective of all things dealing with his family. Since this movie is a biography, it is hard to compare to any other films that have been produced because this film is a reflection of a single man's life and how he chose to live his life. 
 The production of this film I though was very well. They used natural lighting for the outside scenes and provided the viewers with exceptional light on all scenes including the scenes that were being portrayed as the night. Another thing that was done well was the angle of the cameras. When important stuff was about to happen, you could tell because the angle of the camera eliminated all dead space so that the viewer could focus on what was happening. This tactic is to make sure the audience doesn't miss essential points to the film that portray and make the theme what it is."
" The Good American, the Bad Arab and the Ugly Movie...
",-0.5994,-0.8111,2017-12-22 00:00:00,4,"In a Hollywood Villains' Special, the late critic Gene Siskel stated that movies like ""True Lies"" were predictable consequences of Arab terrorism. One could say the same about Clint Eastwood's war blockbuster ""American Sniper"" with September 11 as the moral alibi. The context is to blame, yet we blame the people, the film is no ""Apocalypse Now"" but Arabs are no Viet-Kong either.I'm a huge admirer of Clint Eastwood and I've always avoided this film. Even in ""Unforgiven"", a movie I despised, the ruthless executioner had a few words about the men he killed. ""American Sniper"" doesn't bother and I almost admire its boldness. Chris Kyle, the titular sniper kills Arabs, but since they're all portrayed as heartless ""savages"", there's not even one millisecond allowed of ethical contemplation. Even in ""Saving Private Ryan"", for one moment, there was Steamboat Willie, although his sympathy capital was averted a few scenes later.No such thing in ""American Sniper"", a film shot in Star-Spangled Banner colors, white for the purity of Americans, all noble-hearted God-fearing souls with great values such as family, loyalty and friendship, and red for the dirty bloodthirsty Arabs. No wonder the experience of the films inspired some enraged tweeters to go kill a few Arabs, after watching ""American Sniper"", you'd think you're doing the world a favor, I mean, is there any other community where mothers send their own children to death? Chris Kyle's best-selling novel didn't give much latitude for mercy, and neither does the adaptation. Yet I somewhat felt engaged by the character study about the patriot who ""did his job"". And there's nothing in Bradley Cooper's performance that doesn't do justice to the legacy of Chris Kyle, he was an American Sniper, and well, he ""sniped"". But he had that alpha-male presence, towering over his comrades, lifting heights, even his son is the tallest of his school and is predicted to be 6'4 tall, this is definitely the best breed of men, which says even more about the ""container"". After all, doesn't Kyle believe that America is the greatest country?Anyway, there are probably good Arabs who aren't all bloodthirsty savages but these are not the Arabs Kyle, or Eastwood, or any viewer was interested in. Fair enough. But even with that mindset, it was a close call before I decided not to press the ""Power"" button. Eastwood made the right choice by throwing the most offensive material in the first quarter because whatever happens to Arabs after that is never as insulting as this opening. The film starts with muezzin call and in the same time, you see a scarf-clad woman giving a weapon to a little boy. Notice that when the kid is shot, the woman doesn't even weep or take him in his arms, she takes the grenade... so she proves Kyle right.Once again, after ""Rules of Engagement"", we have the obligatory portrayal of Arabs as savage people who don't hesitate to sacrifice their own lambs. And we have the obvious parallel between the muezzin and the illustration that Islam is rotten to the core, and then we have the sunny Texas, a good old church and a father teaching his sons not to fight unless it's called for. There are three people in the worlds: wolves=evil, sheep=blind or weak, and sheepdog. Guess who are the wolves? Cut to the Nairobi attacks and Kyle's engagement in the Army and of course September 11 immediately dissolving to Iraq. So, we're supposed to believe that this war on Iraq was fair and driven by the patriotic fervor of American youth decided to avenge the innocent victims of September 11. Give me a break!Yes, the film doesn't care about politics, but neither did ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" yet these movies dared to question the necessity of these wars. In ""American Sniper"", this is not even left as an option, just when you're trying to convince yourself that this war is pointless, there's an Arab or an Iraqi who makes it ""personal"". While we can focus on Kyle's conviction and dedication to the American flag, there's nothing that ever raises the question of the war's usefulness, why would he believe that killing a bunch of Iraqi would protect American families back there. And even in 2014, we all know it was a bunch of lies. Please, Mr. Eastwood, why smacking all these grandstanding poses over our faces... ellipses are great narrative devices, but not at the expenses of intelligence. Violence wasn't taught in Iraqi schools! ""American Sniper"" was too one-sided it was painful.The film wasn't even ""bad"" technically, but if you believe this is a masterpiece, keep in mind that any Iraqi director with half the talent of Eastwood could have made a similar movie from the other perspective, with a little focus on one jail torture or two. Eastwood's focus was Kyle and while he can't speak for himself, the man wasn't the fondest on Arabs, but the film makes no effort to show one Arab with one redeeming quality. I didn't expect ""Battle of Algiers"", but even ""Inglourious Basterds"" had good Germans!Some say the Charlie Hebdo attacks' context didn't help either, but let me remind that in 2014, hundreds of civilians died in Palestine and no one gave a ****. So this is a real revealer of a disgusting hypocrisy. What is not tolerated for Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood can get away with it... and right now, he's preparing his next movie about other terrorists attacks. Any occasion to show the ugly side of Arabs is welcome (and once again, the film was shot in my country, Morocco). And what could have been an ""interesting"" reflection of violence's blindness, I mean by that the untimely death of Chris Kyle in 2013, well that he was killed by non-Arabs was one fact the film wasn't interested in. One-sided to the core... or as if hating Arabs was the best way to honor Kyle's memory."
" Very good Book
",0.4927,-0.0677,2017-12-15 00:00:00,8,"Chris Kyle was born on April 8, 1974. He was raised up in a ""Country"" family. Later on his parents had another child. Chris became an older brother and looked after him. He got his first gun when he was nine. He loved to guns, horses, and really anything Cowboy-ish. As he grew older his passion for horses and cattle grew. He got so good with riding horses that he tried out for some local rodeo tournaments. He had thought of the going into the military when he had finished high school, but ended up going to college. While going to college he worked on a ranch, a big one. Riding horses, feeding cattle, and doing anything his employer wanted really. After awhile he had thought of the service. He went down to the recruiters office and him and all the recruiters talked. He liked the Navy the best. He went in to sign up, got everything checked out, before he could get really into the navy they found out that he had a bad accident when he was younger. When he was younger he rode horses, the horse tripped and fell on top of Chris. Cracking his ribs, completely obliterating his wrist, and some other minor injuries, are what occurred. Since his wrist were almost obliterated he had to get steel rods put in them, and since he has steel rods in his wrist, the Navy wouldn't allow him. Chris finding out this, went back to work at the ranch again. Not long after the Navy recruiter call him up and told him he could join. Chris went through all the trainings and test, passed them and started to take on more stealthy trainings. He was deployed many times during his first 4 years of the Navy.I think the main strengths are in the emotions mixed in with all the war Chris has been going through. Chris brings you through his journey and what he experienced. Yet, he spills his emotions out. Generally people think "" Oh, you're in the navy. You don't really have feelings."", But in this case it's the exact opposite. Chris opens up and shares his feelings, emotions, and thoughts. I think the author's message is mainly about war. He wants to bring notice to how war really is. This is a valuable book, if not the most valuable. It teaches lessons that everyone should learn. One incident that I thought was important was where Chris and Taya had their second child and Chris still went back to defend his country. That scene was really emotional. I would recommend it for high schoolers, it;s best for males and females. I would recommend i for people looking to join any branch of the service. Someone who is afraid of war or doesn't like war shouldn't really read this, after all this is based on war. It is generally a book for all."
" Sniping at American Sniper
",0.0,-0.4554,2017-11-15 00:00:00,3,"I went and saw this film at the recommendation of a cineaste. It is about a sniper who kills a lot of people and then is killed in civilian life himself The main trouble is his home life or lack of it and the less than full support that his wife gives - in the real life the widow says the portrayal was acceptable. I thought a lot of the goofs were to hide operationally sensitive material - but he never has a spotter. The sniper has a gopher who banters with him but no one with binoculars spotting targets. The sniper takes telephone calls more than once from his wife whilst he is under fire or looking for targets. The Baby is plastic (already er spotted by other reviewers) The child ages five years but Iraq seems to remain the awful mess that the Americans created, when the sniper signs up for another tour. An Iraqi asks ten or so American Christians to an obviously Islamic Meal (Eid al fitr) and no one senses that it is very odd that the Iraqi seems to have no suitable Muslim friends himself to share this important event with. The calluses on the host's elbows show he is a sniper but not The Sniper that they seek so they sort of let him go. The Sniper snoops around the host's house and a creaking floor board luckily gives a way the arms cache hidden beneath the host's floor. This is very lucky as the floor is composite terrazzo - and the cover is a metal plate and there is not a floor board in sight to creak. Will the snipers run of incredible luck run out ? Yes at the end of the film - kind of friendly fire In the Boer War 1899 - over 95% of bullet injuries were head wounds because the Tommies wouldn't stop looking over the top of boulders and the Boers would pick them off. And Dang me! a hundred years later the American were still doing it in Iraq - there is an awful lot of peeping over solid brick walls - one time even the Sniper does it and doesn't get his head blown off even tho the Daeesh sniper is waiting for him. So all in all - since we know the ending, a film to see in company and pick at."

" I should have loved this
",0.5994,-0.9967,2017-11-12 00:00:00,5,"First, let me say that I'm not very much into politics, so my views about this film have nothing to do with political views, or even moral views or anything like that. Even though this is based on a true story, I watch films like this as if they're completely fictional. And I watch films from more of a ""formalist"" perspective.I do like this genre. I'm writing having just seen this film for the first time in late 2017. Both ""The Brave"" and ""S.E.A.L. Team"" are about halfway through their first season, and so far I love both. I love video games like the Sniper Elite series. I've enjoyed playing the Call of Duty games.And I did like this film. But in my opinion it has some serious problems too. I want to talk about what I believe the problems are. The problems are why I didn't love this film. I'm assuming you've already seen the film, or you at least know a lot of the plot basics.In a nutshell, director Clint Eastwood tells this story in a very choppy, superficial way, with too many plot holes and too many befuddling character actions.The timeline jumps around, with an early flashback that has to be gleaned simply contextually. All of the jumps have to be gleaned contextually throughout the film. That flashback works out fine, although when we jump forward in bits and pieces I had a bit of confusion re whether I was still watching the two brothers or different characters. I was confused why they were all of a sudden rodeo cowboys, because the film just jumps into that with absolutely no preparation or set-up. And all of a sudden Chris not only has a woman he's living with but he's already having problems with her, she's already fooling around on him, etc. That part is like we've jumped to at least the middle of something that should be a separate film, where unfortunately we've missed a bunch of important scenes.A couple later jumps, halfway through the film, are even more confusing. Chris's military team apparently blow up a terrorist known as ""the Butcher."" Meanwhile Chris's wife--who by the way does a couple personality 180s that are never explained or justified--is pregnant with their first kid. Well, not too long after that, we jump at least four or five years into the future, because the kid is now four or five years old, but (a) Chris goes back to the Middle East as if it's the very next tour relative to the one where they blew up the Butcher and Chris's wife was pregnant (so what happened during that four or five- year span?), and (b) they talk about the Butcher as if he's alive. For a minute or two, I was assuming that the plot must have jumped back in time in the Middle East again. This is one of the problems with doing time jumps only contextually, so that they're unannounced.The Butcher is never brought up again, so I guess that they did blow him up. A couple other plot holes are more problematic. Chris's brother, who seems increasingly weaselly and traumatized by being in the military in a war zone (we never see why), more or less just disappears from the film about halfway through. Chris's parents are never mentioned again after the early flashback scenes, either. I don't know why. There didn't seem to be any sort of problems in their relationship with Chris. More seriously, though, is the fact that one of the most interesting things about the true story this is based on is the fact that Kyle wound up killed by a fellow military member, only once Kyle was back in the States, back in civilian life, and where he was trying to help out the guy who killed him. We're given no details about this. We're not shown it. We're only briefly shown the guy when he shows up at Chris's house, they drive off, and that's it, the film is over. We learn that Chris was killed via a brief title card.Maybe most problematic though are the characterizations. I mentioned Chris's wife's 180s earlier. Well, Chris is portrayed as quite enigmatic and as increasingly unlikable. There seems to be something seriously wrong with him mentally, and it only gets worse as the film goes on. You want to kick him at times when he's on the phone with his wife during battle rather than concentrating on the turmoil at hand. And then you want to kick him when he's back home and he seems increasingly catatonic, as if he couldn't care less about his family--at least not until he gets back to the Middle East, so that he can call them during the middle of a battle again. And then eventually, it seems that Chris's mental problems have more or less vanished with no explanation. It's another plot jump effectively.Akin to Chris's distractions with phone calls, both the U.S. soldiers and the Middle Easterners are regularly shown behaving as if they don't quite grasp that someone could be shooting at them at any moment, from any possible angle/vantage point. They'll be la-di-da-ing around and then oops! I'm shot in the head, where that consequence is of no surprise to the viewer, if only the characters had a bit more awareness of the peril they're in.Focusing only on the problems, it must be a wonder why I liked this film at all. There was enough that I liked, but I certainly didn't think it was perfect. Since comments seem to be either praise or political or moral complaints, I wanted to bring up some things that I feel are formal flaws with the film."
" A deeply moving war film
",-0.6344,-0.8555,2017-11-09 00:00:00,10,This film about deadly American Seal Sniper Chris Kyle is a deep look into the psyche of a trained legal killer. In an Iraq plagued with ambushes and IEDs the US forces are often sitting ducks for the ISIS militia operators. Kyle sets about providing cover for the army patrols. Bradley Cooper executes a convincing role in this very realistic film. He shows a deep understanding of the pain suffered by men experiencing war memories. Since this film is based on a real life experience the ending is a though it has been written into the screenplay. Kyle is helping a PTSD sufferer adjust to civilian life when he is gunned down at a rifle range. One of America's greatest heroes id taken from us too early. This makes me as a viewer reflect on how fragile our hold on life is. This is one of the best war movies about Americans at war that I have seen.

",0.7645,0.9578,2017-10-29 00:00:00,7,"American Sniper (2014) This is a biographical war drama directed by Clint Eastwood and loosely based on the memoir American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. A Navy S.E.A.L. sniper saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Coming back home after four tours of duty, he finds that war was easier to deal with than the aftermath. The film also receives mostly positive reviews from critics. Bradley Cooper's lead performance and Eastwood's direction received the bulk of the praise. It drew some controversy over its portrayal of both the war and of Chris Kyle, himself. It received six Oscar nominations, but only winning one award for Best Sound Editing. It was the second most profitable picture of 2014. The film is engrossing, poignant, and both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's distressing when people are critical of the film for reasons other than the acting, directing or quality itself. It's about their disagreement with its political attitude. This is a well constructed film and is very entertaining. That's a simple fact. It's a dramatic interpretation and isn't claiming to be anything else. To criticize it for things it never claims to be, just isn't fair. I recommend this movie, but if you are unable to put politics and personal feelings aside when watching it, you only keep yourself from enjoying a very good film."
" Pure propaganda
",-0.25,-0.9231,2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,When i watched this movie i felt disgusted during the whole thing. This sniper is killing people in their own streets and homes while invading their country under a false premise and he is proud of it. Iraq had done nothing to justify the invasion by America. Until this day no WMD's have been found and left iraq in a terrible state. The movie glorifies murder of civilians and American soldiers acting as bullies and executioners. What a hero for killing people from such a distance...
" Unconscious Voter
",0.0,0.8959,2017-09-18 00:00:00,5,"If the first casualty is truth then any reporting, on any level, on every war must be a lie. Simple right? Not so. Of great credit to any nation is the finesse with which their propaganda machine can revise, repackage and recreate a lie which has been told a number of different ways already. Grab the gullible with the thinnest veneer of purported reality, then when they forget that it's only a movie, once that magic spell has been cast, take them to wonderland, the chocolate factory and the North pole all at once. Throw in a cross genre spell ingredient like Rom-com fantasy leader Bradley Cooper, and his soulful baby blues, suddenly the producers are atop the highest tower shouting 'show me the money'.Make no mistake: this is one of those hum-vees. It is only a movie. It has several well used aspects of the film story teller's trade. It has a soundtrack. It has Revillie, several times. It has well practiced film masters offering their expertise in presentation. It attempts to access feelings in the viewer. It seems to do these things acceptably. Acceptably. Not fantastically. Not well. It is no more than a $12 blow job off a corner hooker. Any votes cast in the first few minutes, in the after glow, are dubious at best. When that hooker looks up with big brown eyes in the last moments and says I love you, expect to be spit on. It was interesting, it was even momentarily entertaining, but it was only a story.Before putting a score to this controversial modern fantasy ask yourself some hard truths about it: Did you manage to keep focus all the way through? Did you ever have the slightest doubt about any of it? Did you want to shout out 'that's not right'? Did you pause and come back? Perhaps you missed something and said 'oh well doesn't matter'. If you can say yes to any of these then ask yourself one more thing before rating this film: was it really that good, at all?"
" Inconsistent mess from Mr. Eastwood
",-0.3612,-0.0008,2017-09-17 00:00:00,2,"I really didn't care much about the politics of the movie. It is obviously a recruitment tool by the US military to urge kids to join the army. So I would purely evaluate it on the merits of filmcraft, acting and storytelling alone.The production of the film is very commendable. The scenes of rubble and ruined infrastructure are exceptional, as I couldn't point out where the exact location the movie was shot (perhaps some place in Easter Europe?). The acting by Cooper is also noteworthy. As a standalone action/ war movie, it is pretty decent but to be honest, there is much to be desired here. The action scenes are a hit and miss; what stood out is an ambush scene somewhere in the middle. Also, the scriptwriters ripped off a few scenes from Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (using a mirror to see who's shooting and the way the rival sniper was dispatched is almost identical to how the German sniper got wasted in that film). Additionally, for a movie supposedly about a sniper, there isn't much sniping going on but plenty of scenes of Cooper using an automatic weapon.Better just watch this on cable or rent the DVD. Enemy at the Gates is a superior sniper movie."

When are we going to stop to produce such awful mislead movies!! I mean we know definitively that the war on Iraq, Afghanistan is unjust, unnecessary, unclear . I just watched American Sniper, War Machine. Every child that was killed by the Americans held a weapon. WoW. More than 200k Iraqis were killed. Great portion of this number were innocent people. funny how the movie projected the friendly relationship with the Iraqis except for Al-qaida. Al-qaida wasn't a major player in Iraq . People actually held arms. Normal people held arms stood their ground and defended their country. Hollywood should invest more in trying to capture these dilemmas rather than just focus on an imaginary navy-seal sniper who probably has done his fair share of violations during the war in the name of simply...it is what it is.Because let's face it...he's from Texas, eh? Doesn't matter if Saddam was an evil dictator. As long as the USA is not an honest player in the Middle East. It will never manage to sell their ideals . Fockin....Jarheads!

" This movie demonstrates why ISIS is an American Creation
",0.2732,-0.9957,2017-08-06 00:00:00,2,"Viewers of the movie ""American Sniper"" applaud the story of former Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle as an authentic war hero credited with over 160 kills, saving American lives. Others denigrate a sniper as a coward who kills while hidden from a safe distance.I saw a different movie. I saw heavily armed American soldiers terrorizing unarmed men, women and children as they kicked down the doors of their homes, unannounced. I saw the devastation and destruction of an entire city. In one scene, Americans are killed by an enemy sniper while building a wall whose purpose was not evident. Sent to kill the sniper, Kyle and his fellow soldiers are caught in a deadly ambush. The movie shows an overwhelming American force with armored vehicles and armed helicopters against an enemy who operates from a small Toyota truck.I saw a movie that shows the futility of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I can identify, from my own experience in a different time and circumstance, how each door knocked down, each family terrorized, each prisoner tortured, each civilian killed, would motivate newly created ""freedom fighters"" to fight against the American invaders who appear to have no mission other than chaos and destruction.The movie demonstrates, possibly unintended, how the ""Independent State of Iraq and Syria"" or ISIS is an American creation; a nightmare of its own intrusion. Allegorically, no different than needlessly poking a stick at a beehive, and now having to face a million angry killer bees."

Kyle learned the tricks on this matter when he was a child and would play a prominent role in the fight against terrorism that began after 9/11. Of course, the controversial feature film American Sniper did not win Oscar for Best Movie and would star leader Bradley Cooper head home with empty hands. The Academy does not like politics. They only like the 'appearance' of political engagement. And that's exactly what American Sniper, the first movie about the Iraq War, does: It's not a real representation of the real thing. Clint Eastwood's newest film is not an honest portrait of war and what it does with the people involved; It is an unforgettable homage to the navy, considered by many Americans as one of their greatest legends."

I'm sorry I feel this way about Cooper, he's just NOT my ""cup of tea"". Other than that the movie was fantastic and I would recommend it to EVERYONE. CLINT EASTWOOD ROCKS!!!

It deals with his life far away from his family, his life in Iraq and his inner struggle between killing or being killed. The film was inspired by a real story. It's a really emotional film which perfectly transposes what a soldier can feel. It is very well filmed and Bradley Cooper is a really great actor. For us the flaws of the film is the banalization of war which it shows with the American point of view..

The film is suspenseful and emotional, it makes very interesting parallels between Chris' private life and his life as a soldier who has to kill children and women. I do think that the whole question of the film is: ""is Chris Kyle a hero?"". Indeed, he could be considered as a hero because he kills human bombs which would have killed many people in return... But can we really consider someone as a hero if he kills children? I believe that Clint Eastwood, through American Sniper, does not really give an answer to it, he just leads us to think about it... which is even more interesting and difficult."

Kyle becomes known on the battlefield and back home as a highly effective sniper amassing a record number of enemy kills. The movie follows his reason for enlisting, honing his skills and shows his effectiveness over a few tours. It also shows how he is mentally effected back at home with his family. The story feels like a bulleted list told very straightforward; not very creative. Bradley Cooper immerses himself in the role and becomes Kyle and does a great job portraying a wide range of emotional states. His performance is what keeps this movie from drowning as just another bland Iraq war movie. Complete with many expected emotional scenes to draw out audience emotions and true sad ending to the life of a awarded soldier. No mention of whether or not he actually punched Jessie Ventura at a bar. Ha."

The subject of the film is the American invasion of Iraq in the early 2000s, and the film follows the path of a famed sniper who chalked up an endless amount of enemy kills during his multiple tours of duty.Like THE HURT LOCKER, this is a gritty and realistic film that seeks to get into the heads of the soldiers involved on the ground. It does so admirably, building up a fine psychological portrait of the main character, and Bradley Cooper impresses in a role in which he mains himself virtually unrecognisable from the brash, handsome leading man so familiar to audiences from his roles in LIMITLESS and THE A-TEAM among many others.The film features plenty of battle footage in the form of chases, shoot-outs, and a suspenseful siege situation. Obviously, sniping plays a big part in the action and the sniper scenes are hard-hitting and realistic; I also appreciated the moral dilemma bits that are presented throughout. The bits back home are less enthralling, although the climax is very well achieved and Sienna Miller gives her best performance yet."

",-0.6689,-0.2668,2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"This movie was incredible, there was never wasted moment. All the scenes were wonderfully put together by the legendary Clint Eastwood As well as being very well acted by the almost unrecognizable Bradley Cooper As Chris Kyles and Siena Miller as Kyle's wife Taya. Bradley Coopers depiction of Chris Kyle is accurate and he steals every scene he's in from Kyle's thick Texan accent to Kyle's view on war. The Battle scenes are raw and very authentic and to a certain point very realistic. My only main concern was the use of the word "" savage"" to depict Iraqis and some of the earlier scenes before Chris goes to war. Apart from that Brilliant movie directed by Clint Eastwood and the phenomenal performances by Bradley Cooper and Siena Miller."
" Chris Kyle's American Sniper Hits the Target
",0.0,0.7913,2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"""The thing that, uh... haunts me are all the guys that I *couldn't* save,"" said Chris Kyle about the men and women he could not save in Iraq. An action-packed movie, American Sniper, portrays the life of a Texas cowboy seeing the Twin Towers collapse on 9/11then enlisting in the Navy and becoming a Navy SEAL. In American Sniper, Clint Eastwood did not shy away from showing Chris Kyle's emotional and psychological battle in and out of the military. At times in Iraq, Kyle had to contemplate shooting women and children. Kyle learned from his father that the world contains three things: ""sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs,"" who he must defeat and defend. Hunting skills Kyle learned in Texas paid off as he developed sniper skills, which eventually led to confirmed kills—160 in total during his time in Iraq. Eastwood shows Kyle as a selfless and reliable military man, who desires to protect his country. Bradley Cooper plays Kyle with an attitude of edginess and resilience. Also, Cooper portrays Kyle as a true American hero and shows the side of Kyle's PTSD. At the end, a lasting impression of the movie explains Kyle was giving back to a veteran at a shooting range, which ultimately cost Kyle his life. While showing the struggles of a Navy SEAL, American Sniper grips the hearts of viewers who catch a glimpse of a devoted and patriotic American hero. This movie deserves a 4.2 out of 5."
" Review of the movie, not of any realities or politics surrounding it.
",0.0,0.9955,2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie about Chris Kyle, a sniper and a navy SEAL, famous for ridiculous amounts of confirmed kills. ""American Sniper"" is based on Kyle's own autobiography. And that is all this movie is. Some things are bound to be more dramatized for the movie for narrative's sake, some things probably left out for the same reason, and it certainly isn't preaching about politics. It's the first war movie for a long time where ham-fisted political commentary is not present. So I take it for what it is, instead of whining about what it isn't.""American Sniper"" is a thoroughly well-executed movie. It's confidently directed, well-shot, well-paced and well-acted. It works. It never fully reaches its potential, but then again it's never bad.This story isn't told in ""acts"", but ""tours"" instead. Build-up at the beginning doesn't waste any time, and after that we get so see the four tours in order. After every tour, the main character Kyle (Bradley Cooper) spends time at home, finding it difficult. Every tour gets easier for Kyle in the battle with his brothers in arms, but harder at home with his wife and children. This flow or the narrative works surprisingly well.There is a simplistic ""rivalry"" going on throughout the film. It feels like some old-fashioned revenge-based action movie at times, where the main character just has to beat the ""final boss"". I can't say I hate it, since it tightens the movie at some level, but I can't say I love it either. Anyway it's there, it works, but I can't help but feel the artificial nature of it. I wasn't there (in Iraq) though, so I can't complain about it any more than that, nor can I pretend to know what really happened.There is a sense of PTSD awareness in this film, and I applaud ""American Sniper"" for that. But herein lies the biggest disappointment: it's not examined nearly enough. For the movie to strike that really powerful chord, PTSD in all its ugly glory should've been more of a focus and dramatized. We get plenty of hints and good, subtle moments, but never the scene that really pays off. Then again, this might have been the case with the book too, I don't know.Cooper is very good, and gives a somewhat subdued performance. Everyone else is at least okay, even though sometimes the other characters might come across as cardboard cutouts. Sienna Miller is good as Kyle's wife, even though her role is just that and not much else, and Keir O'Donnell equally good as Kyle's brother with his limited screen time.And even though Cooper is good, I would've wanted to know the character better. There is a certain disconnect, I'm not entirely sure what he's about. Perhaps the book didn't paint that picture either - and autobiographies can't always be trusted if that was or wasn't the case - but I would've liked to care more. When the movie isn't about the war itself, it's important to fully flesh out the character. I understood the character, that wasn't the problem, but I wanted the movie to go so much deeper. It didn't.It's a Clint Eastwood movie, so don't be surprised if you're not being preached to. Many people seem to take this movie as jingoistic preaching though, simply because it refuses to put down the troops and also because it doesn't shove a political message in your face like every other war movie nowadays. Perhaps it's not politically correct, and perhaps it only deals with the book, not with all realities and events that might have taken place. There is some patriotism involved, which in itself should not be a bad thing. I do not hold these things against this movie, and I certainly don't expect movies to educate me or pander to me. I expect them to tell a story from whatever viewpoints they choose, and if something gets me interested, then I will find out more and do my own research.To summarize, ""American Sniper"" is a good movie. It doesn't reach the heights of a great movie because there is a certain disconnect concerning the lead character, and the PTSD elements aren't dramatized enough to my liking. But as it stands, it is good. If you are a person who pukes at the sight of patriotism, then you might not like it. If you are a person who demands sensitive subjects handled from all viewpoints and politically dissected whenever possible, this might not be for you. For everyone else, I recommend this movie. Take it as it is: as an adaptation of an autobiography, adapted by people who know their craft."
" A Film About Many Things (But PTSD Is What Truly Stands Out)
",0.4404,-0.5508,2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"While settling into my theater seat to view ""American Sniper"", I had about as high of expectations as any movie I'd seen in the past year. Rarely do those type of expectations ever get lived up to these days, it seems. That was emphatically NOT the case with this film, however, as it captivated me from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilers), ""American Sniper"" focuses on the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who serves multiple terms in Iraq during the early 2000s while wife Taya (Sienna Miller) dutifully waits for him on the homefront with each deployment. Over in Iraq, Chris is an expert sniper, tasked with providing air support and protecting ""his guys"" from any number of unforeseen calamities (a scene where a young Iraqi boy begins to pick up an explosive device is particular telling on what mental torture Chris's job can be at times). Because, Chris doesn't want to leave until the ""job is done"", he's a little bit less himself every single time he returns stateside. This puts particular strain on wife Taya and a growing family that Chris does not know how to integrate back into.One could almost say that ""American Sniper"" is two movies in one...First, it is a taut psychological spectacle of the type of warfare that was being conducted in Iraq. A sniper from the opposition is nearly Kyle's equal, while a notorious ""Butcher"" commits atrocities that begin to wear on Kyle's mental faculties. To me, this was the ""weaker"" portion of the film (though to call it ""weak"" would be a travesty), but that's likely because I don't have first- hand experience in that type of environment. It was all kind of surreal to me. A number of people in the group I saw the movie with thought these war/sniping scenes were the best part, so it was probably just personal preference.Secondly, and to me this is where the flick can go down in history, are Kyle's struggles with post- traumatic stress disorder. Each time he returns back to Taya and the family, he is a little bit less himself, and even a bit more anxious to be back to the battlefield. I was utterly fascinated (and quite more than a bit proud) by how a man can voluntarily put himself into harm's way in order to finish the war at hand and have the back of his fellow soldier. These are the scenes where director Clint Eastwood really excels. He knows exactly how to prod the emotions and then get out of the way so as not to seem preachy.So, for me, ""American Sniper"" made my ""top films"" list because I've never seen a war film tackle the issue of PTSD so brutally. Usually, a soldier returning home will say something like ""I saw some things over there"" and that's all that will be said. Here, however, the PTSD is actually experienced in chilling fashion.If Bradley Cooper doesn't get serious consideration for his outstanding performance as Chris Kyle, it would be a crying shame. The auxiliary cast is good as well, but Cooper is almost literally front and center in every meaningful scene or exchange in the picture. He'd certainly get my vote for ""Best Actor"" to get a gold Oscar, that is for sure.Overall, ""American Sniper"" is one of those films that is tough to ""like"" even though it is truly a gem. The reason being? It is so hard-hitting. The story of Chris Kyle and his family is one that resonates in this day and age, while Eastwood was the perfect choice to get the most out of it. If you want an insight into many aspects of being a soldier that you had likely never thought of before, ""American Sniper"" is the film to watch."
" Too long but with surprising end
",0.3919,-0.6125,2017-02-21 00:00:00,6,I watched American Sniper on Netflix and I needed three evenings to see until the end. I think the running time is with 140 minutes too long. The scenes were sometimes too slow paced. Apart this it was great cinema and at least you have here a true story. I never imagined that it ends so surprisingly but I won't spoil more about. The cinematography is well done and the special effects on the battle field too. It offers many emotions and psychological moments. If you like this genre of movies give it a try. But be warned there are some brutal pictures hard to digest. If you like these desert terror thrillers don't miss the other fast paced ones The Hurt Locker or Lone Survivor. 6/10
" Yes, support the troops, but this ?
",0.4019,-0.9671,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"I could only watch the first half an hour of this. Where in Gran Turino Eastwood crafted a fine film, in Sniper I was left feeling put out. The child killing scene is obviously supposed to highlight the evils of Jihad but he brings it in too early. I was initially reminded of the NAZI's employment of child soldiers at the end of WW2 but then Eastwood drops a sniped enemy soldier into the frame in a way that was just wrong. Do soldiers really seem so casual about death in this way? I doubt it. Where Clint made some really good points about violence in Outlaw Josey Wales and the Dirty Harry films, here, this comes across as a propaganda film. And make no mistake, I am aware of our current war (being British) and this could have been a worthy effort. But better, more thought out propaganda (not to mention entertaining) films were made in WW2. I support the difficult efforts of both American and British soldiers as well as Iraqi soldiers currently winning against Daesh in Iraq, but they deserve better than this. To be fair this is a film aimed at the American market that could be difficult for a Brit to understand."
" I wish Bradley Cooper was fighting Aliens or something...
",0.0516,-0.9579,2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"I want to first of all start off by saying that I rated this movie based on how good it is as a stand alone movie. The acting by Bradley Cooper, the directing by Clint Eastwood and the story in general were great at the very least.I was, however, very put off by the fact that this man was seen as a hero and a ""Legend"" for killing people in a war which we still know to this day was unjust. The Iraqi people were seen as evil and bad in this movie, even though they were just trying to defend their country from the American invasion. I also want to point out that this man in the movie was motivated to go fight in Iraq after seeing the 9/11 attacks. This even though Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with those attacks. I wonder if this movie would have been as great if it was from the point of view of an Iraqi sniper..Like I said, this was a great movie in terms of its story and its action. If this were a story about Bradley Cooper killing deadly aliens I might have actually really liked this movie (though I fear it wouldn't have been as loved by others as it is now). If you don't like the idea of watching a movie about the killing of people who are still suffering as a result today, then avoid this movie."
" Bradley Cooper does a fine job playing sniper Chris Kyle
",0.3818,-0.9925,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"This film is based on the story of Chris Kyle, a sniper in the US Navy Seals who earning to sobriquet 'The Legend' for the number of enemy combatants he killed more than any other member of the US Armed Forces.The action opens in Iraq as he observes a woman giving what appears to be a grenade to a small boy; as the child runs towards US troops he must decide whether or not to take the shot. We then flash back to his childhood in rural Texas. Here his is taught to shoot by his father and also to stand up to bullies. As he grows up he becomes a ranch hand and rodeo star then he hears the news of terrorist attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and enlists in the Navy. He trains and eventually becomes a sniper with the elite Navy Seals. During this time he meets and marries Taya. Then the unthinkable happens; terrorists fly planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the rest is history.We then return to Iraq and see that he takes the shot; the child is dead but he has saved lives. As his tour progresses he quickly becomes known for the number of enemy combatants he has killed. He is soon helping to hunt a particularly vicious enemy known as 'The Butcher' as well as an enemy sniper who had previously competed at the Olympics. After the tour he returns home but he isn't the same; his mind is still in Iraq. He returns for three more tours before finally returning home to his wife and two children but is still troubled.Before watching this film I knew how Chris Kyle's story ended but not much else about him; this meant the details that were changed to make the film more dramatic didn't spoil it for me. Director Clint Eastwood tells the story in a no nonsense manner; there is little in the way of gung-ho flag waving nor is there condemnation of the war. Instead we see men doing a dangerous job in a dangerous place and the consequences it has for them. The action sequences are intense, especially the climactic battle which ends in a sandstorm. This scene brilliantly captured the confusion of war as we can hear gunfire but can only see the occasional silhouette. Bradley Cooper does a great job in the lead role; bringing an intensity to the character without making him some sort of super-soldier. Sienna Miller is fine in the supporting role of Taya; showing how those thousands of miles from the battlefield struggle while their loved ones are in danger. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a good modern war film that doesn't shy away from showing the effects of war on those who take part."
