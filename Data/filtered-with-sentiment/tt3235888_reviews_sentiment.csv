" Worst movie ever

" Quite creepy and interesting but felt like another generic horror Netflix film/series
",-0.2067,-0.8349,2021-03-19 00:00:00,5,It is clear that the director tries to add some shock value and get into the viewer's head from the beginning. Some parts made no sense whatsoever and were just made up on the spot. The characters are pretentious and act like if they were kids in a new Home Alone movie especially the boy who I thought really killed the mood in this film . Ending really sucked and topped it all off really. I wouldn't recommend this film all I can say is that concept is okay.
" It pretentiously follows
",0.0,0.2023,2021-03-16 00:00:00,4,"Jesus, what a drag of a movie. The director is clearly targeting the indie late teen/young adult audience.Good music and cinematography, though."
" Quality horror for a new generation.
",-0.5719,-0.9657,2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I grew up on teen slashers Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Makes me sound like a sicko but I also watched The Sound of Music and Beaches. As silly as those horror movies seem now, they frightened the bejesus out of us as young teenagers. I wasn't as frightened myself during this film but I appreciated the craft in the storytelling and lower-budget frights. I made a calculated assumption during the film that those audience members of the same cohort as our lead characters would find the film as frightening as I did my generation's horror films back in the early 80's."
" Boring and lacks substance, plot and story
",-0.3182,0.3459,2021-03-15 00:00:00,2,"This isn't a story, it's a concept. Overly long shots and synth sounds have to fill in the blanks in this junk food horror film. I only watched this on the recommendation of a friend, and now I'm questioning his taste in movies. This isn't scary. It's full of cliches and teen sex, we've see it all before. Pretension masquerading as creativity. Anyone who likes this movie hasn't seen enough real horror films."
" It Follows didn't scare me enough
",0.3875,0.211,2021-03-10 00:00:00,5,"This is a movie with a very uncanny and tedious premise, I didn't enjoy it as much as I anticipated although I did thoroughly relish the cinematography and the captivating performances of Maika Monroe, especially Keir Gilchrist and all the supporting actors. The score was also great and heart pumping. The screenplay was decent and done by David Robert Mitchell who is also the director of the film and ""It follows"" is his second feature film. I also think the ending could have progressed a bit more.I gave it 5 stars because the storyline was something I couldn't come to terms with and once the movie finished I realized how dull it was but besides that I relished everything else I mentioned above. I would not watch this again."
" They should allow negative numbers.....worst movie I've seen since Broken Flowers
",-0.7096,-0.9763,2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,"These rave reviews have to be bots, paid for by the people who made it! Has to be. There cannot possibly be sane people out there that enjoyed this.Set in modern day, but, has horrible synthetic keyboard music throughout, a poor mans attempt at 80s attire, a poorly decorated house and some black and white TVs, apparently (according to the fans) to pay homage to the great slashers of the 70/80s. Erm? What a lot of nonsense! It's awful! Just awful.Storyline?! Teenagers are followed by ""IT"" that takes on a form (any form) to get close. Touches you, you die. To pass it on, have sex with someone else. If they die, it comes back to you. Yup. Good.Only thing I will say is; The acting isn't terrible.Turned it off after 30mins."
" Plain garbage! It's like a fake movie!
",-0.2924,0.821,2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"This is my first review ever to write of a movie, and I'm definitely doing it for only one reason, I want people to know that the rate given to this wannabe film is unreal. I watched it because it said 7 points something. It's not worth a star. I would even dare to pay someone to watch it to the end. If I bet a $1000 bucks on anyone not to fall asleep I'm surely winning that challenge. I never, EVER fell asleep in a regular movie. On this... I slept more than 5 times. I watched to the end to make sure I could advice the audience. Besides the beginning, the rest is of this film is more than a joke. The final scene more than stupidity. Sorry for those who watch."
" Really enjoyed it.
",0.5563,-0.7248,2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Simple horror film. People who have given this a low rating need to chill out. It does what it says on the tin, it follows."
" maybe I'm just not part of that intended audience
",0.0,0.9507,2021-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Having very much enjoyed the director's later Under the Silver Lake, I was looking forward to this popular success.Unfortunately I had real problems with it. initially I had difficulty catching the dialogue and wondered if I might put the subtitles on and although I eventually managed to tune in to the rather rushed and part whispered and accented exchanges I found I was still rather lost. For all the excellence and horror of the original incident and all the advise to 'pass it on', I got no inkling as to how the poor girl was supposed to do this. I was reminded of Night of the Demon and wondered if there was a piece of paper or something involved. By the time I realise it is sex, I really feeling left out. I now recall there was a hurried exchange between two girls early on where one asks the other if she had done 'it', so maybe I should have been more alert. Or perhaps this is assumed, that within some American religious areas there is an assumed wrongness. Like the old slasher film rule, have sex and die. Really, these days? Or some heavy handed STD warning? Either way having managed to catch up I was perturbed to find that it didn't after all work as simply as that. There was someone called Max and his mother, I saw happen but nobody ever mentions it. In the end I gave up in despair or ever finding any logic or believable narrative. I don't mind puzzling and surreal narratives that leave me bewildered but here there is so much emphasis upon a certain logic in the proceedings that I would have liked to understand it. Sure it looks good with excellent cinematography but there is an onus on the film maker to engage the audience, but then maybe I'm just not part of that intended audience."
" For REAL Horror Movie Buffs
",-0.5719,0.6744,2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Terrifying from the start! There's nothing I didn't like about this film. It's beautifully shot, the soundtrack is amazing and I loved the story and the acting. I won't waste your time. It's a MUST WATCH for any true horror fan! The only people I know who hated it are casuals with no true horror movie knowledge or taste."
" Terrible. Waste of time
",-0.7096,0.4235,2021-02-24 00:00:00,3,Decent concept but poor execution. Extremely dragged out. There was about 15 minutes of good content. Could have been done much better.
" Non scary non suspenseful Horror?
",-0.7845,0.9038,2021-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Essentially there's nothing really wrong with it.
It moves along ok and the casting is fine.
It's just not scary, no suspense so doesn't really rate with me. I've been a horror fan for over 40 years so maybe it takes something really well done (not slashers) to impress.
It is watchable though"
" Great Aesthetic Nothing Profound
",0.6249,-0.9219,2021-02-19 00:00:00,7,"It Follows is a strange film, a very unique horror film while not being all that unique. I know it's a strange start to a review; stick with me. The director and writer are fans of the original Halloween and Friday the 13th plus pretty much any 80s horror film. The homages are paid with the soundtrack (which I'll give credit is pretty fascinating and nice to hear which added a nice aspect to every scene the score was played), the way the killer works by never stopping (Friday the 13th reference) is also a horror movie love homage. The final homage is with the suburban neighborhoods and cars that look like it's from the late 1900s. Even the cabin that our protagonists go to midway through the film looked like a bad shed, the illusion is lost with one of side protagonist female nerd that had a clamshell phone? Reader? Without giving anything away the way the killer didn't add anything to my experience seeing the film it just felt like any other slasher flick with a twist that doesn't make it as good as the critics or audience says. The film isn't bad but in terms of homage to the horror genre, The Cabin the Woods (2011) did it in a far more entertaining way while also being a better film overall. With its low budget, I can't hold It Follows to the same standards as The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Even ignoring any other horror films, It Follows is not one of the Greatest Horror Films of All Time. At least, in my opinion, I think people just got hyped for a unique horror film that was half decent for the first time in 3 years and that's fine but don't expect a spectacular high budget film also the film has a lot of nudity and the entire plot revolves around sex so make sure to read the parent's guide before showing it to your kids."

" Underrated indie horror
",-0.5719,-0.675,2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Now this is why I love film. I'm not a huge horror movie fan, I usually find them predictable and more played for laughs like freddy or jason. Once in a while you get movies like The Conjuring or Hereditary and it keeps the genre going and It Follows is one of those movies. The premise is so awesome, I guess it was meant to make teens abstain which I found comical. But the villain, an unknown entity, that constantly stalks its victim with such menace is just incredible. Even more so since those being stalked are literally defenseless against such an antagonist. It keeps you guessing as to how they will defeat such a determined and unwavering force. The only aspect that I'm one the fence about was the abundance of nudity in the film. I suppose it was used as a ploy but at times it felt unnecessary. Points for originality and atmosphere, highly recommend."
" Unique, surrealistic horror piece
",-0.5719,0.9957,2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"IT FOLLOWS (2014) was a completely unexpected horror film for me. I'm the biggest horror movie fan, yet for some reason this movie never interested me. I tried watching it years ago and only made it through the opening scene, some girl running around in circles in heels from nothing and then she ends up on a beach with her limbs torn off. It seemed silly. Even after having finally seen this movie recently, I still find that scene off putting. The rest of the film after this opening caught me completely off guard and is not close to what I expected. It Follows is so intriguing, deep and provocative, now my mind is swirling with thoughts of when that scene actually takes place. The anachronistic vibe of this movie makes me wonder if that scene is actually in the present while the meat of the film occurs in the past. The girl is using a cell phone to call her Dad from the beach and she drives a modern car, yet at no other point in this movie do cell phones seem to exist and all the cars look old. Everyone uses landlines, drives old cars, watches TV on vintage sets, play almost-extinct card games, and wear old-fashioned clothes indicative of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Finally, the movie is set in the gritty, rundown city of Detroit. Everything about this movie feels like it's set in the past, but the director keeps it ambiguous. Some of the extras and background actors look suspiciously 2000s and beyond, but not to the point of standing out too much. Most films TELL the viewer what era they are set in, but It Follows opts to create an atmosphere that leaves it to the imagination in what period it is set and to work out themselves where the opening fits in. It could be the past, present, or even future based upon the film's plot and what a plot it is!The plot of It Follows is that some supernatural It entity, origin unknown, follows people around after they have had sex and takes their life as punishment, which is basically a metaphor for casual and unprotected sex leading to negative consequences like STDs, AIDs, and an unfulfilled existence. The only people that can see the creature are the non-virgins. The main character Jay literally says after she has sex with her boyfriend ""Where do we go from here?"" which is an indicator that perhaps she made a hasty decision in losing her virginity and should have waited for a better time. But instead choosing to have sex with him, a guy she barely knows, led her to this It creature coming after her for the rest of the movie. Maika Monroe is brilliant as the protagonist Jay. Monroe imbibes Jay with charm, street smarts, toughness, and strength. She gives the film it's heart and sells the surrealistic nature of the piece through her wide-eyed sweet nature and innocence. I had actually scene Monroe in a couple of movies before watching this one, but didn't even realize who she was until afterwards, so this almost felt like watching an actress for the first time, especially due to how unique this film is. The supporting cast is excellent as well, all in sync with the tone and vibe of the film. They all GET what type of movie they are in, so they their parts spot on, which is surprising as these actors are pretty much teenagers. They know they aren't in some run-of-the-mill dumb slasher movie, but a thought-provoking commentary on bad life choices. But at the same time, their dialogue doesn't feel pretentious or too old for them. They still come across as teenagers in the way they talk.The supporting teens are Jay's sister Kelly (Lili Sepe), their friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi), their neighbor Greg (Daniel Zovatto), and finally their friend Paul (Kier Gilchrist). Also there was Jay's boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) who gave her the ""disease"" early in the film. Paul was my favorite of this group as I loved his dynamic with Jay. I really liked how each character were either symbolic or had a deeper meaning to the plot. They weren't just Jay's sidekicks. Kelly was the conduit of the group as she held things together since Yara and Paul were directly more her firends than Jay's and also Kelly and Paul worked at the same place. And being Jay's sister, she had the biggest investment in helping her through this crisis. Greg was the good-looking bad boy who always had sex on his mind and who only wanted to ""help"" Jay to satisfy his desires; he didn't even believe in the creature and was only in it to get with Jay. Yara is the storyteller and narrator as at various times throughout the movie she would quote poems and tell stories that were symbolic of the plot. Hugh was a representation of the bad choice of Jay jumping into a relationship with the wrong guy who was just using her. Finally, Paul is the geeky loser who never gets the girl and has always loved Jay from afar, the one who if given the chance would treat her like the queen that she is. The film plays on the common theme that Jay is only interested and attracted to bad boys like Hugh and Greg, while only seeing Paul as a friend. It's almost like she thinks that Paul is too good for her. And I think that the way the film plays out is symbolic of this, because after the It seems to have been defeated, then Jay herself feels free to be with Paul.While the movie is filled with symbolism, it still has a very concrete horror atmosphere as the group of teens investigate, explore, and band together to defeat the creature. There is a reasonable amount of action and chase scenes. The pulse-pounding music score is very unsettling and really amplifies the tension. And even though the film has a very low budget, the film doesn't look cheap or unprofessional. The cinematography is good and the shots are edited well. And the anachronistic, surreal quality of this piece gives it a timeless quality. A surprisingly effective and powerful horror film. In retrospect, easily one of the best of the decade."

Here a curse is transfered during intercourse. An undying beeing follows (the title) everyone with the curse. Catch is...only the victim can see it.
If you succed in transfer than hopefully the next victim can survive....because after it is dead the curse is back.

" A sinister tale of lost innocence
",-0.5574,-0.4754,2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"There's a lot to like about this film. Clearly there are obvious cinematic influences, the Halloween style soundtrack, the faded cool autumnal look, the sexually infatuated teens all relate to recent horror tradition.While for some this is imitation, I kind of enjoyed the way it was all put together. The photography and cinematography is interesting as well, the camera is always moving, the people in the background are constantly involved, I was left wondering who was a threat and who wasn't throughout.This mostly is a well told story of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Sex is this point around which death stalks its victims and there is more than a hint of a suggestion that the point at which we achieve adulthood is where we are forced to consider our own mortality. Death come in the form of those who have already been taken.Deeper philosophical interpretation aside, there's enough teen slasher shocks and jump scares to satisfy the horror movie fans.For me the ending let the film down a bit, it felt like a door was being left open for a potential sequel which is inevitable these days I suppose.All in all this is a solid films, excellently produced, written and directed."
" great concept very stylized
",0.6249,0.4005,2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"The hook of the film is clever. The very 80's style of the way it's shot and edited is done really well since that's obviously what they were going for. I would say fans of classic horror films would go for it. With that said, I didn't find it to have a ton of tension as the movie progresses so people with shorter attention spans may not be into it as much. Still was fun overall."

" Unique Horror Film from Last 10 years
",-0.5719,0.877,2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,"I love this movie. Starts off with a bang and grabs your attention. Unique premise in a world of a lot of crappy horror films. The first time I watched it, I remember wondering...where the heck are they going to take this? But honestly, they did a great job of the ending-it made perfect sense. The disturbing images in the film are so scary and not an ounce of cheesiness, which is my kind of horror film. I also dug the 1980s vibe. Definitely worth a watch! I was so happy when I stumbled across this little low budget gem."
" This movie needs a sequel!!!
",0.0,0.8719,2020-11-23 00:00:00,10,"Never has a horror movie given you so much and taken so much away. It Follows had everything I love in horror, suspense, abnormalities, thriller and weird stuff."
" Well done for what you get.
",0.2732,0.919,2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"The low budget caused some obvious production limitations - in particular an awkward bounce from day to night and back again, and some iffy effects. However, the suburban Detroit setting provides a nice backdrop, and of special note are the Redford Theatre (est 1928) replete with its beautiful pipe organ, and the indoor swimming pool put to spectacular use in the film's climax. As long as the audience is not expecting the typical teen slasher, this creative horror film should gain an audience while putting director David Robert Mitchell on the fast track to bigger budget films.So what's the bottom line? Well done for what you get. Writer/Director Mitchell has a heck of a career ahead of him. Several ""jump out of your seat"" moments. And also a plot riff which you just know was contributed by some of the frat boys who crowd-sourced the film -- ""you can get rid of the curse if you just sleep with someone, fast!""The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater.
There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you."
" Finally a good horror!
",-0.2714,-0.9889,2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"I would like to give this 7.4 rating but well, here we are with a rounded 8.
It is interesting that you almost only find 1-3 ratings or 8-10, rarely inbetween. How come? I think the modern age taught us that horror = jump scare and slaughter and that is why some people might not be able to recognize this as horror.
This movie needs imganiation, it needs a dark atmosphere, preferably not in a cinema but (almost) alone in a room to let the fear sink in.More into detail: This movie is slow, people get haunted by the worst STD ever. It is the constant pressure on the humans and hopefully on you as a viewer, the constant ""omg where is it??"" where the horror comes from and that is very refreshing and very welcome. Even as a viewer, you can constantly look around and be like ""omg, that's it, isn't it??"".
Fitting to modern age, nothing is explained, nothing is found out. That is ok. In the century of epic series with amazing plots you cannot put a complete plot anymore in one movie, the time is just not there. So we see an increase in sub-plots of what certainly would be a far bigger plot overall.If it is so good, why do I only give 7-8 stars?
It has obvious flaws: There are two very annoying jump scares. These do not fit into the movie and are not related to the monster at all. I can only assume the producer forced the regisseur to put them in, they make no sense whatsoever and ruin the quiet horrific atmosphere when they appear.Second flaw is obviously the strength of the ""thing"". The speed with which it killed the one dude makes the scene on the beach very strange. Also it was apparently way too fast inside the water. Overall we see inconsistencies which can only lead to stars being removed. Also, as many have said, it sometimes is hilarious how adults are never part of the movie even if it would really make sense here and there."

Maika Monroe leads a solid cast excellently. The premise is certainly interesting and it does create suitable tension, while the effects used are neat. The plot is quite sexual, potentially overly so in a couple of moments but in truth it needs to be for the most part. I would've, elsewhere, appreciated a deeper dive into the antagonists, also.I could see a sequel coming from this, it's the sorta concept that could easily produce many sequels. I'd be fine with just the one, but would watch another - it must keep the same vibe though."

However, the pace of the film is mind numbingly slow. I enjoy a slow burn If the plot and characters are interesting, unfortunately this film is very boring. The acting is poor from every character which adds to the boring pace. I can't understand how anyone found this film slightly creepy, there are one or two scenes which perhaps could be slightly jumpy, however the film on the whole is not scary at all. Finally the ending rounds up the entire terrible experience by making no sense whatsoever and is ambiguous either because it's pretending to be clever or the writers couldn't think of an interesting way to end the movie. Overall, a major let down, there was a lot of hype surrounding this film and it doesn't deliver."

Great acting, musical score and idea, that something reletness and after you, no matter where you go or what you do. No stupid jump scenes or boring teen slasher here thankfully.

" Very slow. Very boring.
",-0.4323,-0.9914,2020-10-21 00:00:00,1,"The concept seemed weak but I watched this movie because the reviews are deceptive.
First off, I'm not a fan of PG-13 or morally preachy horror movies .
The writer/director seems to rely on a very slow (extremely slow) pace and sucking the audience into the plot detail of new and completely convoluted horror villain. We're curious to see what this villain does throughout the film... The villain doesn't do much of anything. Instead we spend the entire staring at the main character as she does absolutely nothing but run away, stare into space and sleep through her curse.
I spent plenty yelling at the screen for stupid things like, why does her arm cast survive the water? Why did they think the pool idea would work after they already know the rules? Where are the parents? Why were there no cops at Greg's house the next day?
As a viewer, you can pretty much guess what the most probable scenario is to beat this villain (sleep with hooker and hope for the best) and it only takes the entire movie and several very long and unnecessary scenes for the least interesting character to try it at the very end."

The suspense, the strangely satisfying mish mash of 80s-90s style of soundtrack and set design, mixed with modern tech that the characters have.
The premise behind the horror is one of the more terrifying ideas I have encountered and its executed very well. Very well acted also.
A very different ""coming of age tale"" if I have ever seen one."
" a very well made horror film
",-0.3758,0.9931,2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"The thing i like about this movie is that theres a lot of little details going on in the background that rewards people who pay attention, the movie was genuinely scary and one thing i really liked about the movie was the cinematography, theres a lot of unique shots in the film that really utilize the medium of visual media to its full potential, although sometimes it wasnt done in a very good way like this one scene where the camera spun around for like a full minute, it was an interesting trick that the director used to portray stuff to the audience but it was kinda neausiating. the acting was pretty great although most of the characters didnt have any real personality, i honestly dont remember any of their names because they were so forgettable. one thing i didnt like about the movie was they were kinda inconsistent as to the rules of what the ""it"" has, like in the beach scene where it seems to have the ability to run faster than it normally does in between shots (because theres NO way it travelled that fast in its regular speed offscreen) or how there was this one shot where it was standing stationary on top of the main characters house even though in every other scene of the film the only time where it was able to stand still was if there was something in its way. there was also this other scene where it started throwing objects at the main character instead of its usual tactic of just persuing her at a slow pace, if it can utilize physical objects then why dosent it get a rope and try to lasso its targets or something? also in almost every scene the monster took the form of a naked person, i dont think theres a particular reason why it did that but hey, gotta get that sweet R rating somehow am i right?
anyway this movie was still pretty enjoyable (even if it may not seem that way with how much i ranted on about the problems surrounding the monster) and i really think you should check it out, it honestly seems like an underappreciated film to me"

" Chilling scares, flawed narration
",-0.3612,-0.9749,2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"""It Follows"" is a 2014 horror film directed by David Robert Mitchell starring Maika Monroe and Keir Gilchrist.
⚪
All in all, this almost unemotionally narrated haunting pursues to induce paranoia, as well as to raise awareness, as it can be seen as both a scary story and metaphor for sexually transmitted diseases, and just as its original, unhurried entity, it only moves on in a slow manner, but thanks to capable actors, an eerie score and the lack of details, the actually artless tale generates an unforeknown vehemence and offers some chilling moments that leave you breathless most of the time and haunt you afterwards.
⚪
The title for day nine is an independent production that has been on my watchlist for quite some time now, as it was recommended to me by many people multiple times, and the only reason I haven't seen it earlier was due to the simple reason that I wasn't able to track it down for a reasonable price. Only coincidentally, I found a copy of this flick in my father's shelf while I was searching for horror films in general. As it turns out, he has seen it and disliked it a lot, but nevertheless, I wanted to go in open-minded. To be honest, I can see why people might hate and love it, because, as per usual for independent productions, it is an uncommon horror film that doesn't follow the usual pattern. I for one took a lot of pleasure in it, even if it is not flawless. From the beginning, it is obvious that the whole premise of the film is a metaphor for teenage promiscuity and venereal diseases in general. Once you have had sexual intercourse with someone who is cursed, you are cursed as well. This is basically all to it, and the execution is as minimalistic as the premise. Protagonist Jay, a shy and somewhat disturbed teenager, is the one this happens to. The actress portraying her, Maika Monroe, managed to convey this feeling of constant anxiety and insecurity excellently, and was a critical factor of why it works out so well. Another pivotal element is the characterization of the hostile entity that pursues her throughout the entire runtime. Seriously, iconic antagonists like the running Ghostface or the cunning Freddie are undeniably haunting and that is why they are legendary, but I seriously underestimated the effect this unnamed entity might have. Aside from the fact that it comes in all shapes and sizes, it only walks very slowly. It doesn't speak and doesn't run, it just approaches slowly. Believe it or not, this is extremely unsettling to watch, especially, when the camera isn't always focussed on it and the entity can be seen randomly in many occasions, without the characters taking notice of it. Furthermore, most of its forms looked like average people but some of them had something genuinely chilling to them. For example, when this tall man all suddenly steps out of the darkness or when that little boy crawls through the hole in the door, I was truly terrified. Well, but if the horror aspect is done decently, what keeps me from giving it a higher score? Frankly speaking, the narration had some minor flaws, because as horrifying and packing as it may sound, the unfolding of the story is pretty dragging. When it wants to shock you, it succeeds, but in many occasions, most of them, frankly, it was way too distanced and matter-of-factly. Of course, the emotional outbursts of Jay were intense, but most of the time, I just had the feeling that I was experiencing the plot form afar instead of at point-blank range. This all was probably initiated because too many scenes were too taciturn and silent when it should have been intense and agitated. Yes, it wasn't always agitating when it was supposed to be. That not much is in fact happening in this film is something I expected from an independent production, so this is tolerable. On top of that, it offers a myriad of anachronisms: cars from different decades, use of phones from different ages, no mentioning of the internet and the use of solely old films. All those seemingly insignificant details implicate that the film has some dreamish touch to it as well that would explain the basic neutral narration. In the end, it becomes one of those films I can see the reason why some would dislike it, but ended up liking myself. It is suspenseful, weirdly dreadful and subtly symbolic. Most importantly, it shows that a film can still create new types of horror that haven't been thought of before. Precious, indeed."

" Good horror film
",-0.2023,0.7669,2020-10-06 00:00:00,7,"I'd highly recommend the beautiful cinematography alone, something great and not seen that often in horror films.The topic itself is novel enough and proposes interesting viewpoints to watch this film from. The basic plot is a horror story with a curse that follows people who are 'it'. The curse is temporarily passed on when the person has sex with another; and it latches on to them.The demon takes up physical form but is invisible to anyone not cursed, and it seems to devour it's victim sexually until they are dead.On the other hand the demon could be taken as a representation of something else; others have suggested guilt, or judgement from others, or even STI's such as HIV.Either way the movie was enjoyable and something I also thought was excellent is the music. In addition the lack of jump scares was a breath of fresh air, and should be applauded.7/10."

Very effective horror."
" One you will never forget
",0.1695,0.991,2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,"A Frightening and incredibly grounded horror flick, It Follows defines a new horror generation in the most unique of ways- while also being quite suspenseful throughout. I really admire the look and atmosphere of this film. Some may criticize David Robert Mitchell with his lack of appeal or lack of taste in making the film more, for lack of a better word, good to look at, but that's just what I love about it. It Follows feels real, and it feels real not only due to the films tone, but it looks real. It doesn't rely on pretty settings, CGI, or any other artificial surroundings to make it an appealing picture. It feels grounded in this way, and in the way that it portrays its characters, giving them depth without forgetting their flaws. It becomes sickening at times to see so many horror films use cliched characters in its supporting and lead roles, but It Follows doesn't only feel unique in its approach, but very well crafted. Its script is without a doubt, masterful storytelling, and I praise Mitchell for writing it, as well as again directing it with a budget of only 2 million. Its cast is impressive, with Maika Monroe being the obvious standout, as well as Keir Gilchrist and Jake Weary. Its cinematography is impressive, unique, and very unsettling, and I almost find a comfort in the fact that all parts of this film are very unsettling- including the wonderful score throughout. The film may not be the most entertaining horror flick, but luckily it provides just enough suspenseful and interesting moments to carry itself along, even enough so that I am anxious to see it again. In the end, It Follows is a wonderful and incredibly creative effort that will not go unnoticed and is bound to be recognized by future generations for some time.

" Very Creepy and Much Better Than I Was Expecting!!!

It was simple, but very creepy. Horror movies don't have to be overly gory for it be good. Just the thought of some entity slowly following you non-stop until it kills you is very scary to me. I'm so glad I finally watched it.A young teen girl named Jay is dating a guy named Hugh. She thinks they're hitting it off, until he acts weird at the theater and wants to go someplace else. After a consensual sexual encounter, he knocks her out and ties her up and tells her to prepare for what is coming. An entity that only they can see will start pursuing her until she's dead, or until she hooks up with someone else. The entity can look like anyone and can change its appearance at anytime.The next day at school, Jay begins to see an old lady in a gown outside the classroom slowly walking toward her, getting closer. She runs out and seeks help from her sister, Kelly and their friends, Paul, Greg, and Yara. They keep her company at night and drive her away, anytime the entity comes close to her. None of her friends can see it, but she can. They must come up with a plan to stop the entity from killing Jay, or pass it to somebody else. I thought this movie was very original and creative. I would highly recommend IT FOLLOWS!!!"

" It's refreshing to see something different in the horror genre!
",-0.6114,0.9915,2020-09-15 00:00:00,7,"I got introduced to David Robert Mitchell through Under the Silver Lake, a film I consider to be a misunderstood gem, but I didn't get round to seeing the film that popularised him. Having seen it now I am really interested in what he makes in the future.It Follows is about a teenager named Jay who finds herself being followed by a supernatural force after a sexual encounter.Horror films nowadays are the same thing over and over again. It's sad to see great horror films like Hereditary, Midsommar and The Lighthouse not earn nearly as much as movies like Annabelle or Ouija. It's refreshing to see another terrific horror film like It Follows come and break the cycle.I can see why general audiences would dislike this film. It keeps jumpscares to a minimum and people may not find it that scary. I remember hearing how many people said it was the scariest film they've seen in years and whilst I wouldn't agree with that statement, I still found It Follows to be very creepy. The concept alone of some random person following you and no else can see them apart from you is really freaky to me and that's where this film got under my skin. I loved Mitchell's focus on atmosphere rather than jumpscares. The opening scene, which is done with an impressive one shot, introduces us to this dark and creepy tone that doesn't leave until the end. On top of that, one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack. Disasterpeace, who also did the soundtrack for Under the Silver Lake, blends the modern and retro 80s style and creates a fantastic eerie and haunting soundtrack that fits the film perfectly.What I also loved was how David Robert Mitchell respected the audience. Regular horror films tend to spoonfeed them information but there are so many hidden details Mitchell hides within many frames that it requires the audience's full attention. The performances are also great. Maika Monroe does an excellent job and the rest of the cast all give good performances. The film is definitely inspired by old school 80s horror films. You can feel a John Carpenter vibe in the cinematography but at the same time Mitchell sprinkles a few modern elements that create a timeless feeling to the overall film. Where I feel the film falters is the rules of its universe. There are times where I saw some inconsistencies in the rules but I think what this film achieves definitely outweighs its flaws.Once again, David Robert Mitchell has proved to me what a talented director he is. It Follows is a very atmospheric horror film that doesn't resort to all the cheap ways you can scare your audience and I respect Mitchell for bringing us something new."

I did truly enjoy this movie but to many situations happen off screen & questionable scenes that seemed to directly contradict the set up or the scene immediately before kept bringing my enjoyment to a halt.The movie holds its own when it comes to cinematography in its amazing color palette & beautiful wide shots. The music is also an absolute stand out. Great old school slasher-esque with pounding bass to drive home the stalking dread. These were my two highest points from this film as a whole. Closely followed by the overall concept & delivery.Maika Monroe's character Jay takes over the curse from Jeff Redman played by Jake Weary early on in the movie & we follow her & her closest friends as they try to simply survive IT. Most of the acting here is well delivered with one or two forgettable roles. Maika Monroe is not only the lead but is the stand out performance. Nobody was overwhelmingly bad in their performance.The Curse can be anywhere & anytime. Watching in the background for the extras brings an easy 2nd viewing. It is consistently building suspense & dread without becoming annoyingly repetitive while bringing you into the groups paranoia filled experiences. When the characters attempt to outsmart IT this sometimes can lead to both great simplistic prevention to completely unexplained set ups with almost no pay off.

",0.0,-0.9584,2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Whether or not you're looking for a ""horror"" or just some sort of slasher film, you won't find it here.At the very start, we see the death of a girl and do not know how or why. After very slow and uneventful dialogue with little story telling, the protagonist has a sexual encounter with her date for the night and is followed by a ""sinister"" monster that her date informs her is passed through having intercourse.He warns her not to let it touch her or she will die. How he knows this is not explained even though he is not the first person to get it. Nobody else can see the monster unless they have had it passed on to them at some point in time. However it can still interact with the world around it by manipulating objects and pushing people other than its victim. Most of the time it stands there and moves very slowly unless it is directly in front of its target.The protagonist's friends are all heavily gas lighting her about the monster's existence despite witnessing objects moving or being broken and of course her obvious distress. None of the characters themselves are likable and the protagonist is difficult to empathize with because the viewer won't care about her.The monster it self, taking many mostly familiar forms, is not threatening to anybody aside from those it has an attachment to. As a result of the characters being very two dimensional, there is a complete loss of any sense of danger or worry. There are just a lot of questions that don't have real answers. It is left for interpretation, which honestly seems like a lazy way to make up for the lack of effort being put into the story or the characters themselves.To top it all off, the whole film was very awkwardly shot, perhaps as an attempt to make the viewing experience more immersive but it just ends up being a distraction. As a whole, the film was very hard to be invested in and to take seriously."

" Eerily Disturbing With Terrific Cinematography, But Let Down By A Big Plot-Hole And Pointless Characters
",-0.0258,0.5106,2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Pros:
1. The cinematography is great. The slow purposeful camera movements give the impression that the characters are constantly being followed, as well as the wide shots giving the feeling that the characters are being watched.
2. The score is used sporadically and minimally used, but it's used to good effect to enhance the tension.
3. The clean and crisp sound design really helps to set the viewer's nerves on end.
4. The monster is utterly terrifying with its seemingly invincibility and indomitable spirit.
5. The movie raises interesting moral quandaries and commentary on loose sexual morals, in addition to the dangers of promiscuity.
6. The jump-scares compliment the horror aspect, furthermore, they're very well-timed.
7. The ending suitably ends on a tense and paranoia-fuelled note, with the implication that the monster will always follow.Cons:
1. A couple of the acting performances are a little stale.
2. The dialogue is rather clunky at times.
3. There is a rather large plot-hole: If Jeff/ Hugh contracted the disease from a one-night-stand via a person he didn't know, how did he work out that it shape-shifted, as well as working out how you pass it on?
4. Most of the characters, especially Kelly Height (Lili Sepe) and Yara (Olivia Luccardi) feel pointless as they're given pretty much nothing to do."

I can even appreciate the throwback style and the creative way it was filmed. It's well directed and the acting is fine.That said - it's not remotely scary. I know horror movies are subjective and not everyone is going to get the same thrills another person might. But for me; I just found nothing about it ""intense"", suspenseful or frightening at all.There are some good moments. Towards the end, when the group of friends band together to try to stop ""IT"" at the pool - there's some pretty cool and well done scenes there. The rest of the movie is basically half naked men and women slowly following some teenagers around.I get how the idea of being stalked and seeing people that no one else can see would work for horror films. But it didn't really work in this movie for me. I just didn't feel any intensity or dread while watching it. Also, they didn't utilize the ""it could be someone you know"" concept that well. That could have made it a lot scarier.And I'm no writer but I feel like everyone ""infected"" could have banded together and tricked IT somehow, I dunno. There's really no explanation of anything. Sometimes a little mystery works in favor of the movie but here it just made me feel less invested in the story.I'm not trashing the movie at all. I can see why other people like it. However, I was ready for some spooky thrills and intense scares and this didn't really provide that."

The only way to rid himself of this force is to let it kill him, or to have sex with someone, thereby passing the curse along to them. The latter is his choice and we meet Jay, an odd (to me) young lady that goes out on a date with this guy. They end up having sex and he shows her ""it"". Jay is at first traumatized because she feel violated, he knocks her out and ties her up to prove ""it"" is real. She soon realizes that ""it"" is real and the chase is on. She gets help from her sister and some friends, but the question of whether she can escape is never far from your mind.This is a well done entry into the newer horror genre. It is quite creepy at times, but not outright scary, unless you have not seen a lot of horror movies. Though the main premise of this movie is sleep with someone to be free, the sex is not explicit and the nudity is quite obscured and fleeting. So yeah, not great but a very good movie."
" Scary like Mary Poppins
",-0.1779,-0.8801,2020-05-11 00:00:00,2,"The only scary thing for me in this movie was the cord hanging from the wall-mounted telephone in Annie's kitchen. It was completely twisted and no one, not a living soul, had either the time or inclination to unwind it. This, in itself, was blatantly cruel and bothered me for at least 20 minutes. (I hope this doesn't constitute a spoiler.)My wife and I were both terrified; terrified that somebody would break into our house, hold us at gunpoint and force us to watch the entire movie. Fortunately for us, that didn't happen.
Anyone who became scared watching this film, should never, under any circumstances, consider watching Rosemary's Baby or the original Exorcist, and if you were terrified, then, by all means, stay away from the original Jaws.I am astounded at the 8.3 Metascore, but then again, my wife and I find that for the most part, the criteria for a high score must include deep, profound meanings and subtle undertones that completely elude us, (neither of which apply to this movie) or, as is the case here, be so inane, as to make watching it a real chore and not worth the effort."

This is clearly very low budget (not always a bad thing with a horror movie) but it is quite slow, very derivative (the Ring, Let the Right One in, Cat People, Halloween etc) and rarely makes any real sense. For instance, if only the victim can see ""It"", then how could our heroine see her neighbour's?There are a few good scenes - the swimming pool, the beach - but more or the overly long running time should have given us some background explanation of what ""it"" was (is it an allegory for AIDS?) or maybe they will give an explanation of it's origins in later sequels?All in all, a minor film, occasionally well made, but no classic."

The first 20 or so minutes were pretty good, but then it just got slow and dumb. I guess, when you really think about it, most horror movies don't really make much sense, it's just particularly obvious in this case. I agree with other viewers who thought it had a kind of cool '80s vibe, but that's about the best I can say about it. In the end, there was no way that I was going to sit through the whole thing, so I fast-forwarded here and there to see if it got any better, but it didn't.

But as the acts follow, it falls into a slump of repeating what you have already seen in lesser movies.Characters choose to do away with any semblance of logic and the ending, at least on the surface, is very uncharacteristic of the premise.
However, there is one scary scene in particular which is ingeniously directed and will remain in my mind as the highlight of the movie. But other than that I wasn't scared almost at all during the entirety of the movie, even though I am not hard to scare; unless I was expected to be terrified by characters watching random people through different windows.On a higher level, the plot attempts to deliver some metaphors which communicate specific moral values and also there are a few not-so-obvious twists that you can miss if you aren't paying attention. Which all are left (presumably artistically) open for interpretation.Overall, the movie is somewhere in between. Its flaws somewhat mask its genius moments, but hose moments are there regardless. In the end, you end up with a good movie, which in my less than humble opinion, is far from a masterpiece. And to be honest, I am surprised by other reviews which most reside at far ends of the spectrum.Personal suggestion: Watch it, if you have no better horror movies at hand."

The monster lurks and appears only to those who have the cursed disease. No matter it's shape or appearance, you will be wise to sequester yourself from all human contact - including sex. Casualties are inevitable and necessary to flatten the curve and rid our communities of the vile hidden evil. It Follows is haunting and the actors sell out to make you look over your own shoulder at every turn. It's a shocking and original take on the age old conundrum - be silent and await thy fate, or run like hell. The fun is in the chase, not the result. This film is exquisite because it takes itself seriously and not afraid of awakening demons from within your bones. Primeval in shocking the audience with manifestations of death, you cannot help but feel like IT is truly behind you and will not stop until you succumb to its passions."

I swear it sounds as bad as it sounds because it was horrible.The characters are mostly as stupid as any other horror movie of the dozen, and the fact that the entity does not kill them when they decide to fall asleep randomly, but it comes after them when they are all together it's very frustrating and makes no sense. Also, the characters are stupid enough to not be sure that they killed the entity and left it ""supposedly dead"" in the pool ignoring the plan they had in the first place...and that shot who hit that girl.... that scene was so hard to watch that my head hurt.The soundtrack is forgettable and it does not inspire a sense of fear AT ALL.

Such as shame that we don't see the girl and guy, after meeting for the first time, making out passionately and knocking things over in their haste for lust. Then the guy pauses to rip open a rubber and the girl smiles as his condom filled hand disappears downwards, and then the lovemaking begins. It would take 5-10 seconds to show that very important step when it comes to sex, because obviously the characters in this movie didn't use protection and now have a sex disease demon following then around.

I caught myself thinking what I would do in place of the characters and where would I go to escape the fate. You can identify with what happens on the screen and it's a rare quality these days in the film industry.It's not entirely bright and got some flaws, but at least tries not to recycle the old washed - up horror cliches and brings some fresh air to the dying (no pun intended) genre."

I thought this movie was really good.First of all, it's a horror movie, and first, it has to scare the audience and he certainly didn't make it. I never understood the subject anyway I mean, I couldn't focus on what year the film went through. There were so many unexplained events that I had a hard time focusing on the film never expected such a complicated movie. The scores are so overrated I don't like it so does not deserve high scores.If we go to the events that I like in the film, that the spiritual being comes directly to you and no one else sees it. I liked the idea of looking directly at you but the movie was not nice."

",-0.7579,-0.9815,2020-01-09 00:00:00,7,"It follows is definitely disturbing and chilling movie, but sorry to say that it doesn't seem scary. So, I guess most of us expecting usual jump scares would be disappointed. Also, it isn't as good as the critics say, it has the flaws too. So, calling it the best modern horror movie or even the best horror film of the decade (Ah yes, a critic thinks so..xD) would be a shame to this genre. So, why are the critics overwhelmed.Is it coz of it's orignality? No, It's because they think that the demons represent STD and the movie would spread awareness against it( Lmao...but to me,STDs seems to be sexually transmitted demons.xD)So, the movie is about a demon whose curse is transferred from one person to other while sexual intercourse. Due to this, the main protagonist girl is affected as his boyfriend transferred it to her and now it'll follow her. Tbh, the acting in this movie is pretty bad, except for Jay (the main girl). That's why we can't feel them. Nevertheless, the cinematography, screenplay and Background score succeds to build a tense and creepy atmosphere which saves the movie.Now, a theory is very popular which changes the whole perspective of the movie. It says that the children in this movie are picked from different timelines and don't have any parents, as we couldn't see them in the movie. Instead they are raised by different demons in hell. Yeah, they are living in hell.
Overall, it is a good one time watch, but definitely not a game changer or masterpiece as many would say."
" It Follows... NOT!
",0.0,-0.2962,2020-01-07 00:00:00,1,"There are so many problems with this. The acting was uneventful. And it was drawn out and boring. The main issue I had with it, is why? Why are they being followed? It was never explained. The only explanation was from the guy in the beginning as to what would happen, not why, and how would he even know the things he knew because no one told him. You can't have an entire movie based on a premise that makes no sense.Horrors in general are basically all the same and rarely if ever do you get something different. This was more of the same.I was constantly waiting for a big reveal and explanation, but it never came. Lame ending."

" It Happened
",0.0,-0.915,2020-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I'm starting to think horror just isn't my genre anymore. It Follows has an interesting concept, one I've not seen before, where the monster/killer targets someone through a preternatural STD. After the mark is passed to someone, the killer starts to tirelessly stalk them. It's slow but smart, which feels like a play on so many horror villains of old that would only ever walk menacingly yet still catch their fleeing victims.Production-wise, this seems like it was made relatively cheaply. There's not really any special effects here but that's not to say there aren't effective shots. Given the premise, they don't really need any crazy CGI or a mass of Bay-esque explosions.The acting felt middling to poor, but honestly that's most horror movies to me. Also standard in horror movies, I feel like our main people are pretty stupid at times and if they'd actually thought about things, the killer is probably fairly easy to deal with.Again, the concept for this is interesting and new to me, and I always value new ideas. It's shot well. It's not acted terribly and is on par for the genre. By the end of the movie though when I was asked what I thought my instant reaction was a shrug followed by ""Its alright."" It just didn't grab me how I wanted it to."

Main theme behind the horror is the development of plots, plot twists, so many riddles, puzzles and the theories after the end.

" It's and interesting premise
",0.4019,0.6357,2019-12-18 00:00:00,4,"It Follows has a high degree of original content in its set up: the originating premise is stark and bold. Imo however that is by far and away the best feature of this horror film.Even this though has the unfortunate defect of inviting speculation as to the immediate metaphorical meaning of the 'sexually transmitted misfortune'.There remains the decided possibility that it's just a good way of making the mechanics of a slasher teen horror film unfold as usual; and we are dealing with a neat and direct take on a writers crafting of cause and effect upon their story and their characters.Another possibility is that it's a direct filmmakers reference to the well known trope of this sub-genre to use youngsters getting frisky as a means of imperilling them at the hands of a monster that has used their 'distracted' state to get into an attack position!!A trope which is often over-analysed by film critics and fans as having moralistic rather than mechanical meanings.At times, particularly in the initial encounters with 'It' a good eerie atmosphere is generated; and this lasts for a fair while into 'It Follows'.Sadly as the plot proceeds most of this good work meanders and becomes formulaic with unremarkable straight forward exploitative shocks and 'nasties'.This left me less and less impressed and less and less sympathetic to the protagonists and to the film as a whole.My final rating is a strong 4/10.....with some recommendations but overall I'm not going to say that I enjoyed 'It Follows' any more than that; by the end I found it to be simply serviceable slasher horror"

Whole idea of story having a deeper meaning through references to literature and sex being both the cause and cure of problem is just so unnecessary and the whole thing would have worked a whole lot better if it was made in the vein of old movies, like, for example, ""Carnival of Souls"". It all boils down to the fact that this movie isn't fun and isn't scary. It feels creepy at few scenes, but that can't help it from falling below my bar of mediocrity. I give it 5.5./10. It's not the worst movie you can watch, but it really isn't any good either."

Goddam that tall man scene is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen in a film. I am giving this a 6/10 for those reasons.What worked so well is that it was very psychological, until a certain point -- the monster is only visible to the infected person, and thus to everyone else, it is like it's in their head. The infected person is totally trapped.... and then they ruin that on the beach scene, which for me watered down all the remaining scare factor to pretty much zero. They made the monster 'physical'. It's there and capable of doing anything a regular person can except it's got a magic invisibility cloak on it for everyone else. This takes a psychological fear into a 'scary killer monster' fear. Now the protagonist is no longer alone, they can (with some level of coordination) get help. And moreover, the monster is no longer invincible, because they can physically be pushed away/delayed from getting to the main character. It's automatically less scary. Such a shame."

I also felt like this movie moved along okay, there weren't any scenes that dragged on too long. The movie did have enough action to keep you interested. The issue is the action could have been improved on. There was very little character development and we basically found out what ""it"" was and that was that. There was no more to what this force was or why it wants to kill you. However, I understand this may have been relating to STDs which would explain it. I just wasnt very interested and the ending made no sense. Also what was the broken leg about? This movie had potential but fell short."

A predator whose soul purpose is to hunt down their prey, no need for food or sleep just the relentless pursuit. This brings on a fear that everyone knows, the sense of someone or something rather following you causing you to constantly look over your shoulder. This along side the fact that you never know what you are looking for adds a whole other level of paranoia.That being said I give this film an 8/10 because the days following my viewing I found myself constantly looking over my own shoulder thinking about the endless pursuit."

Modern classic."
" Eerie, Atmospheric Style that Sticks with You Long after the Movie Ends
",-0.3612,-0.9959,2019-11-05 00:00:00,9,"Some movies ease into their stories the way you might ease into a warm bath. Others cannonball into a swimming pool. ""It Follows"" takes the latter route.During the opening credits, you hear the sound of air being sucked in, like you're taking a long deep breath through pursed lips. Suddenly the sound ceases and the screen hard cuts to a serene tree-lined suburban street, lingers there for a moment, then slowly pans to an ordinary-looking house. It's a calming scene. For about 10 seconds.Then a young woman crashes out the front door and bolts down the block in her high heels, as thundering music floods your ears. She's clearly running from something, but we can't see what it is (listen closely and you can hear the front door open and close after her even though we don't see anyone come outside). She loops back to her driveway, hops in her car, and zips down the road. Next, we see her at a beach, trembling in the sand with the headlights facing her. She calls her dad and tells him she's sorry and that she loves him. She senses her time is nearly up.In the morning, we see her disfigured body lying on the beach with her legs bent in disturbing directions. Woah. That's when I was hooked.Director David Robert Mitchell cleverly plays off the trope that sex-having horror film characters must die. The invisible something that chased the girl in the opening scene is later revealed to be a curse that is passed from one person to another through sex. Once you have sex with the ""infected"" person, the monster becomes visible to you (and remains visible even after you pass it on). It can take the form of anyone - a stranger or someone you know. Then it follows.Mitchell pays homage to horror classic ""Halloween"" with scenic wide shots and a carefully developed eerie atmosphere. But make no mistake: this is a wholly original film. The music establishes the tone of ill ease throughout the film. Viewers are never made comfortable at any point because we are constantly reminded about looming doom. Mitchell sprinkles shots of a person slowly approaching from a distance, barely in focus. Is that the monster? We're never sure. We never feel safe. It's the exact horror facing each of the ""infected"" characters - they never feel safe.Mitchell manages to scare us without turning to the comfortable, cliched ""boo"" scares that populate so many lame horror movies today. Aside from one or two effective jump scares, the film relies on an unrelenting buildup dread to satisfy its horror quota. It's a much more impactful approach than jump scares, which last mere seconds. The scares in this movie stick with you.One of my favorite filmmaking choices in the movie is that when the protagonist, Jay (played with vulnerability and humanity by Maika Monroe) learns about the monster, she doesn't hide her situation. She convinces her friends to help her. Instead of separating the characters and letting them get picked off by the monster, Mitchell opts to show how they come together to protect their friend.If the monster is meant to represent an STD or sexual assault and the shame that follows, then the message is clear: talk to your friends about it. Let them help you, because this is not something you want to face alone."
" Mediocre movie
",0.0,0.8934,2019-11-05 00:00:00,4,"It looks like, and for all I know it may be, a low budget movie made by an entry level crew. They saved budget by only involving a few characters, creating a flat, monotonic script that apart from consisting of uninteresting places and actions, it recursively make characters take completely illogical actions.
On the plus side, I liked that ""it"" had a low speed that made up pretty much all the suspense, and to neutralize a possible spoil - I'm saying that this speed may or may not have changed throughout the movie.
All in all, in the right minds the idea could have been exploited way better.

The script is awful, the direction is mediocre and I am not getting into the acting because I respect their effort since they're still young, but did they really try to begin with? People, if you have a brain that works and you watch a movie that you don't get, it is probably because there is nothing to get. STOP TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING INTO A CLASSIC!

" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.988,2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,"It Follows is one of my go-to horror movies that I never get tired of. It's not very scary but is creepy and suspenseful. From the very first scene you know there is something to be afraid of and I love how it kicks off the dread for the rest of the movie.While ""It"" is passed along via sex, the movie never feels raunchy or gratuitous. Maika Monroe acts legitimately terrified which is probably what prevents this movie from ever seeming stupid. That's not to say there aren't a few disappointments. The last 20 or 30 minutes are a bit lackluster but I still enjoy the film as a whole.The direction, cinematography, and score of It Follows are superb; the 360 shots are used brilliantly to make you feel like danger can come from anywhere, and the music fits each scene so well. There's a very surreal undertone, like how in dreams things don't always fit together or make sense. It's a great way of subconsciously throwing you off. I'm a fan of subtle scares, creepy things you may not always notice on the first watch. In the opening scene you hear a screen door screech as a girl runs out, then off screen you hear it two more times, but see only one other person has exited from it. It's the subtle things like that that I personally love in horror movies. If you prefer jump scares or supernatural-looking monsters, this may not be for you. I recommend giving it a chance though."

The idea of the title is clear and perfectly executed. The main teens (Maika Monroe, Lili Sepe, Keir Gilchrist, and Olivia Luccardi) are NOT oblivious idiots, and are believable in their roles.

David Robert Mitchell's script and direction is amazing and I am impressed by his ability to make us empathize with the protagonist without even developing her too much, the performances are also phenomenal but the one that impressed me most was Maika Monroe (the protagonist). a very good movie, it may not be for everyone but it is very good"

" Lots of effort, ultimately fails.
",-0.4215,-0.9214,2019-09-26 00:00:00,4,"*Minor* spoilers in the review.It's difficult to organize my thoughts on this movie, and speak to the extreme reviews (seems like people are either ranking it 'amazing' or 'trash', and its neither).There is well done suspense and 'scary' moments to the movie; a lot of care was put into this, which I appreciated.The movie is very 'ambient', and well done in that regard (some reviews are calling this aspect 'slow' or 'bored me to tears', but its purposeful and well done in this regard, in my opinion).Why am I giving it a 4/10; the movie manages to make virtually every single possible 'horror movie failure' possible. The main character is told exactly how the evil thing works, and even after accepting that its real continues to ignore what she and the audience know about it. She knowingly follows it sometimes, why? There is literally no point other than allowing the audience to 'see' it in action, but that could be done on camera without her present. She manages to harm it at one point, but then gives up on trying to kill it for no reason. It has to interact with the physical world, its not some magical thing that just *pops* up wherever it pleases, so she could try and get 'official' help (police, etc) but never attempts to. Soundtrack and a lot of the scenery and surroundings make it seem like its set in the 80s but there are modern cars and electronic devices. I found myself constantly wondering where we were and what year it was. You know the movie isn't 'doing it right' when you *constantly* are yelling 'WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?!' or 'DON'T GO IN THERE' at the screen. And these aren't cases where the audience is privy to information the characters on screen are not; they have experienced *exactly* the same thing as the audience, no 'reveals' to just the audience.I really wanted to like this, as it is different than a lot of horror movies, but ultimately it was a massive disappointment due to the numerous and obvious flaws and falls prey to virtually all horror movie tropes (not in a good way).Oddly enough, I do recommend watching it, but if you're looking for a movie to fully engage you and give you a REAL scare, this is sadly not the one.Edit: After reading ALLLLL of the reviews currently on IMDB about this film I felt like I had to add something in response to what I'm seeing in my own review.Probably unsurprisingly, most reviews are 'polar' (either 1 star or 9or10 stars). The 1 star reviews are mostly complaining that its boring and that the 'thing' in the movie is never explained as to what it is, and that something slowly walking at you isn't scary. To these people I say that they aren't horror fans, they're not looking for an actual *scare*, they probably want a slasher or something along those lines. For something to be scary you don't need an explanation as to what it is, in fact, in general that makes it all that much more scary.The other side, the 9 and 10 star reviews praising the film for how amazing it is. Do I get the 'hype' in that regard of it being 'refreshing' and not the same crap that every other horror movie is? Absolutely!!!! But these people must be blind as there are *sooooooo* many plot and logic issue with this film, which are specifically the reason I'm giving it a low rating. If somehow magically the film didn't have massive plot issues (which I haven't touched on even half of them in this review, trying to leave something for people that want to give it a chance) I would easily give this a 10/10.I wish people would be honest with themselves and in these reviews, not just blasting immediately to a 1 or a 10. That's not a review. That's ignorantly trying to force people to like or dislike something because you personally love or hate it."

This question I asked myself would pair with possible solutions and scenarios, and was quite fun to think about. Not only was it fun, but it was terrifying. Seeing 'it' come at you from any distance would induce a strong panic that is displayed many times in this movie, which makes it so thrilling. Added to this was a clever intro, and various other smart ways to make this concept all the scarier.I believe that emotional response is a very important part of quality film making, and one that It Follows should be praised for."
" Slow-burn horror at its best
",0.128,0.9292,2019-08-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie is pure suspence from its first scene (""what is she even doing?!?"") to the very last shot (""it's behind them, isn't it!""). Honestly, I don't remember being involved so much in a horror movie since... well, since a very long time. Like, you actually CARE about the characters' whereabouts, and you genuinely want them to survive their fate. Girls are very pretty too and that certainly helps... A special credit goes to the casting director: each and every actor and actress is spot-on perfect in their role. Only complaint: I found the ""last"" battle against the curse (the pool scene, just to be clear) a little bit contrived and not as effective as it could have been, but that's easily forgiven. Will look for similar movies, ready to be disappointed: it's very unlikely I'll be able to find something better within the same genre."
" It's okay
",0.2263,-0.5426,2019-08-21 00:00:00,6,It Follows isn't terrible.It gives you a decent scare and creep factor. But.It's too short. The plot seems like it was either just cut off or not fleshed out. It's never explained what it is or why it's doing anything which I guess is okay but if the only plot is just following someone why is this a movie instead of a YouTube video?The ending is abrupt and people will say it's up to you what happens but it's not a good ending there's no big event that you would care might happen it kinda just.. Stops.Definitely could've used more plot. Again not sure why this wasn't just a YouTube video.
" You'll Second Guess People Walking Towards You... I Promise
",0.3182,-0.9927,2019-08-19 00:00:00,8,"""It Follows"" hasn't been on my watch list for all that long. Once I heard about it, I heard nothing but good things from then on. The trailer itself (in my opinion) honestly wasn't all that captivating, but after reading up on it, who some of the cast was, as well as - again - all the good things I've heard from friends, those on Dreadit, and elsewhere, I figured I needed to stop being my ol' judgemental self and give it a shot.I didn't regret that.The opening scene with Annie doesn't last too long, but it seals the deal with starting this movie off the most puzzling, yet alluring way possible. She's clearly distressed, sprinting (in heels!) around in what seems to be a ""for life or death"" fashion, telling everyone she's ok. It's not explained (at this point, at least) what was wrong with poor Annie as she jumps into a car and bolts off to the middle of nowhere, but I've bitten the bait and am hooked to see what happens next. Annie makes a call and appears to have hit the machine. Seconds later we see her distorted, deceased, with just as much of an explanation as we had from the get-go.The way ""It Follows"" has began absolutely sets the pace for the rest of the film. In the brief few minutes the movie has began to play it's established to us that our antagonist isn't understood and cannot be stopped, which alone is horrifying. The music (provided by Disasterpeace) so far has beautifully, yet sadistically added tension to Annie's plight and would go on to do the same for the rest of the film.What I liked most about this film was the emphasis the setting brought along with how crap of a situation this was. There's no bright skies when you're depressed, sleep-deprived, paranoid, tormented, and being made to feel as though you're insane, just as Jay is throughout the film. The only scene that shows sunshine also winds up being the scene wherein her friends and sister finds out she's far from crazy.Let's talk about that beach scene, shall we? So well done. The minute I noticed ""it"" simply walking towards Jay from behind, I was alert and anxious as person could possibly be. Is Jay going to go swim and unknowingly avoid it? Does everyone else see them and just isn't saying anything? What is going to happen?! Jay's grabbed, and as crappy as that is, fortunately for her everyone else (except Greg) can see her hair denying the laws of physics. This wouldn't be the only time Yara, Kelly, and Paul see Jay get attacked.The pool. Arguably the best scene in the movie. Let's be frank, alright? Most teenagers - hell, most people in general - make ridiculously, mind numbingly stupid decisions in horror movies. In this scene Jay's friends put to action what they've learned from the beach. ""It"" may be unseen to them, but it is very much a physical entity, as they throw a blanket on to it after being guided by a distressed Jay. Once covered, they attack it, biding Jay time to escape. This scene was as smart as it was riddled with anxiety. Would this scene be the end of Jay? We've seen ""it"" capture others, so could this be her time? I'm not sure if I was rooting for her to survive or if I was just tense due to picturing myself in a situation like that. Either way, the scene was very well done.The acting was fantastic. It took me a good minute to see Paul as Paul and not Marshall from United States of Tara (amazing show, btw), but despite that I have no complaints about acting. Even when it comes to pacing/progression, the film doesn't move faster than it should, and doesn't have anything that might be seen as ""filler"". When you look at the actual cinematography of it, the film is just superb to look at, yet unnerving all the same, but in a good way.... I mean... if there is a ""good way"" to be unnerving.If you haven't had a chance to see ""It Follows"", I recommend it. Seeing all the disappointing duds the genre has been putting out the past decade, this film is a breath of fresh air that brings a much needed taste of something new. I know I'm definitely going to be second guessing people walking in my direction for the next couple of weeks because of it.8 out of 10"
" Not too bad.
",0.431,-0.0795,2019-08-19 00:00:00,7,Not too bad. Worth a watch if you like this kind of horror movie.
" A different horror movie
",-0.5719,-0.9308,2019-08-12 00:00:00,7,"It is a fresh movie of this genre. It is a frightening movie with an idea and it is worth of applauses. Perhaps there are not a lot of tricks that will make you jump out of chair, however, the tense is being built up constantly during the playback.
As I have mentioned, I was really surprised that I was able not only to catch some kind of deeper meaning, but it has also been not accidental; it is an iceberg-type of film. In my opinion, it is a story about experiencing some kind of traumatising event that leaves such a deep wound in one that he may start seeing treath even in the people he loves. And trying to pass one's inner dread never grants a relief; if the passed fear 'kills' one's 'victim', the grief can come back to the 'sender' (it is extremely visible in the situation between Jay and Greg). In the end of the movie, Yara says a very nice quote about fearing physical damage (like death) instead of fighting with the causes of it. Probably that would have saved the characters of this story...
There were some aspects I did not like at all in this movie, that's for sure. The aesthetical appearance and psychological decency of this film was a bit wrecked by the cheap tricks that did not even nicely submerged into the story. For example, although gross 'Its' should have looked scary it was quite dull and made an adverse effect.
Last but not least, I want to thank for an amazing soundtrack. The music is tenseful and original enough that I would like to hear it again and not only as a part of this movie. Believe me, you will like it. In addition, the cinematography is also elegant and captivating.
Consequently, those who are seeking for a classical horror movie to eat some popcorn with friends in a late evening in the autumn might be let down. Anyway, this film will certainly be appreciated by those who want the good time and some thoughtful material both."
" A chiller with a sexual twist
",0.0,0.9557,2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Jay Height is an attractive nineteen year old college student whose life is changed after a casual sexual encounter. Shortly after they have sex the boy chloroforms her. She wakes to find herself tied up and he explains the situation to her. He tells her that a being, who can appears as anybody known or unknown, will start to follow her. This person walks slowly but will won't stop coming for her; if it catches her it will kill her. The only way for her to escape is to pass it on to another person by having sex... however if that person is killed it will start going after her again. Only people being followed or who have been followed cab see it. Jay manages to get her friends to believe her and they try to help her escape but wherever they go it will surely find her.This is a superior chiller. There are surprisingly few shocking moments, most notably the sight of a previous victim in an early scene. Rather than relying on a large body count and gory deaths we get a near constant feeling that something is about to happen. The way the threat is passed from one potential victim to the next; like a game of sexual tag is interesting thanks to the moral dilemmas it raises. The fact that the entity that follows is always referred to as 'It' reinforces the tag similarities even if here the person tagged is followed by It rather than being It. The cast does a fine job; most notably Maika Monroe who is great as Jay. Director David Robert Mitchell does an impressive job keeping the tension high without resorting to jump scares and violent scenes; this is helped by Rich Vreeland's atmospheric score. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans looking for something different."

" It Follows looms closer to your soul with every subversive step the titular entity takes.
",-0.3612,-0.4295,2019-08-03 00:00:00,8,"For me, the best variety of horror mechanisms are the contemporary types that deal with suspense and dread. Mundane jump scares rarely work, with minimal to no involvement in terrorising the audience. But, a mysteriously unknown shape-shifting creature lurking towards the camera at a consistently slow pace? Brutally terrifying. Yet it's the allegorical nature of Mitchell's sophomore efforts that truly captivates. After having intercourse with her date, a young girl is stalked by a transmogrifying entity with only the knowledge that she must ""pass on"" this lurker by sleeping with another person.Metaphorically exploring the rampart behaviour of teenagers who excessively sleep around, the initial ambiguity in Mitchell's concept may put many viewers off. Rest assured, that the deathly ""tag"" premise has an important symbolic power behind it that can be interpreted in multiple different ways, typical from a contemporary horror feature. Personally, withdrawing Disasterpeace's euphoric 80s synth score that harks back to domestic horrors of its time, it's a teenager's nightmare on the passing and experiencing of sexually transmitted diseases. The pedestrian pace of the looming entity relates to the gradual health issues caused by STDs, and Mitchell consistently reminds the audience, through heavy exposition mind you, that it can be temporarily disengaged when ""passed on"". Not necessarily permanently removed though.A haunting yet profoundly imaginative method in societal exploration, whilst still fuelling my nightmares with expertly executed background manipulation. There is nothing more terrifying in film than the camera focusing on something in the background that should not belong. It sends my mind into overdrive! Mitchell's delicate directorial methods, accompanied with Gioulakis' cinematography, showcases a myriad a visual talent. The numerous 360 degree rotations, intricate zooms and handheld over-the-shoulder perspectives were intensely choreographed to enhance the well-driven suspense continuously.Praise must also be given to Monroe who held the film together with her ornate sense of fragility and innocence, teasing with the idea that one can free themselves when not considering the dangers of sex. When she was scared, I certainly felt the same.As mentioned before, the expositional dialogue that existed for the character of Jeff felt unnatural in paving the rules of ""It"". Natural exploration would've delivered grander results, however I'm aware that runtime can be an issue even when offering various open-ended interpretations. The whole swimming pool sequence did nothing for me either and dissipated the beautifully wound suspense that preceded it. Mostly because of how artificial the setup was and the ridiculous amount of plug sockets found adjacent to a swimming pool (health and safety must've had a field day!).Still, It Follows has strangely followed my mind ever since I watched it upon release. It allowed me to dive into a nightmarish vision, interpreting the symbolism for myself whilst perching on the edge of my seat. Minimalist horror at its finest. Just, no more nudity for a while..."

As such, when it started making the rounds and people all over the country started talking about it, those of us in Michigan went out of our way to see one of our own do his thing up on the silver screen.I've been to a lot of made in Michigan features and worked on several but ""It Follows"" surprised me by being both competently made but also compelling in its plot and subtext.The film takes a while to get going. It meanders around our protagonist and her friends as they laze around the Detroit suburbs in the intentionless way that teenagers do and barely even bothers to act like a horror film at all. Except for some ominous tones from a pretty good synth soundtrack to clue us in, it would feel a little like a mumblecore film.Once J goes on her date and sleeps with him, the plot of the film is of and running. Well, more like plodding. The film is slow but after J is drugged and he date reveals that there is a mysterious supernatural stalker/killer whose target is passed along through sexual intercourse there is at least some plot structure to hang the scares and themes upon. As she runs from and eventually faces the It with the help of her friends, J endures, succumbs, and eventually grows to accept the trauma that is now a part of her life."

The cast is superb and complimented by the writing and direction which give the film such a unique flavour that's quite hard to describe.

It feels like there are important scenes that were intentionally excluded specifically to make the progression of events and actions more confusing. The rules were outlined but then it fails to follow them which makes the lack of explanation for the first victim and their place in the spread of the curse even more annoying. The characters are just as much cliche for moronic decisions as any other stupid teen in any other horror movie. The origin of the supernatural presence is brought up but never explored and no motives are ever even hinted at (this is honestly the most ridiculous aspect of the movie, why would a supernatural entity care at all about promiscuity to the extent that it would waste its time and energy stalking these people). There are a lot of inconsistencies and contradictions throughout and that isn't indicative of something so well written that it keeps you thinking and guessing when it's actually so poorly written that it requires the viewer to reach to make sense of it, to draw their own conclusions to fill in everything that was lacking."

Thankfully this movie has none of that. It relies souly on tension and fear of the unknown. The camera work in particular really helps build an atmosphere of uncertainty. I know lots of people talk about how this is a good throwback to 80s horror, but honestly I don't see that. The 80s used blood and gore to get the audience scared. This uses silence and pensiveness to create a dark mood and atmosphere. I do see how lots of people think this is an allegory for STDs and I think if you watch it with that deeper meaning in mind you will find it more enjoyable. My big hang up comes at the end of the film. It doesn't really feel like it end. We don't know if they beat the monster or not (probably not if they want a sequel) and that open-endedness just doesn't work for me here. The other big hang up I have is the same with all horror films: if there is a monster why not alert the cops? There's plenty of evidence for it and no doubt you could get some extra help. Overall I don't think their plan to stop ""It"" was a great idea either but now I'm just nitpicking. Great for some good tense scares!"
" Badly executed film
",-0.4767,-0.9416,2019-06-25 00:00:00,3,"The idea behind this film had a lot of potential; if a curse could be passed on only through sex, then you would have to create a very strong bond with someone and then break that apart, or sexually abuse someone, both of which would be traumatic and emotionally exhausting. This film could have been so much more of a horror than it was.Other than lame teenage acting, this film was bad for a number of reasons.1. Music. What was up with the music?! It's like some kind of retro synthetic crap that really has no place in a horror movie, especially not for the entire movie, when frightening and suspenseful music would have been much more appropriate. It just made it laughable and seem much more dated than it was.2. The speed at which ""It"" follows. To have the evil entity following at slower than walking pace is just ridiculous. You could easily evade this entity without difficulty for the rest of your life if you had to, so the fact that even 1 person died is just unbelievable.3. It's not actually scary. The scenes where you are clearly intended to be frightened are just, well, not scary. I wouldn't go as far as saying they are laughable, but I would definitely say that they are ineffective and unentertaining.I just wouldn't recommend this movie, I'm sorry."

After the very recent release of ""Under the Silver Lake"" I can now say that David Robert Mitchell is definitely one of my favorite directors and definitely one of the finest directors working today. ""It Follows"" came out in 2014 and I remember going to see it in the movie theaters. I got there a little bit late so I actually missed the first 10 mins so i did initially miss the famous opening kill scene. However I watched it twice since then including last night and i realize now how much praise this film really deserves. It is masterful and refreshing. Its a rated R teen horror movie that will sit well with any crowd. Its a very unique film and is so creative that I almost had trouble truly wrapping my mind around it all even though its quite simple. Though at times intense and always creepy, I wish Mitchell showed a little more horror. A little more of the entity. Even though this movie is aimed at a younger crowd and the horror seems to only scratch the visual surface, it is still somehow quite quenching to the horror afficiando no matter how deep, scary, or gory they like their movies. The budget was around a million dollars and you can see tye budget dispersed very evenly through out. Smart directing, good execution, beautiful color schemes, a loud and dread inducing score, and young angsty teens having lots of sex. One of the best horror films of the past 10 years"

While I am not from the state, I enjoyed this film from start to finish so much that I chose to purchase it versus rent it time and again. First, the acting is excellent as are the characters and the plot is an edge of your seat thriller, so I understand why it quickly became a cult classic fave of movie bloggers. The simple idea that a virus stemming from a social disease can take the form of a paranormal entity with human form and strengths is unnerving in and of itself. This is one that you won't want to watch alone, in the dark or on a rainy evening. The moral of the story is ""young men and women, mind your morals for there may be dire consequences.""

GREAT music, a mix between an indie band and 80's horror soundtrack. Very interesting anachronisms as well. It's set in modern day, but the elements of the sets range anywhere from the 1950s to the 1970s.I also must say, some pretty decent acting as well, and likeable characters.While the element of ""it"" following is really creepy at times (also, it's strangely beautifully done), and while the notion of the premise of the film is very engaging and keeps you interested, it does grow a little old at times. The following part is creepy. It's not so creepy when they get close to a victim. It's not bad, but it's not quite as exciting as the build-up to it.Overall, a beautiful looking indie film that any suspense/horror film seeker will enjoy."

Great camerawork, editing, style, music, etc, will always eclipse bad acting. Take the original SUSPIRIA for example, which is a masterpiece even if the acting is not that great.

Like using the cheat codes in a game to get all the weapons at the start - there's no sense of discovery or achievement.There is no tension, no gradual unveiling of the creature - it's just there, plodding towards it's marked victim with no reason or motivation. We never learn why and the lack of consistency in the creatures actions causes confusion for the viewer.The acting is mediocre but consistent with the apparent budget so it didn't bother me that much and the dialog wasn't bad between the characters so there are some plus points there.The main issue is the typical horror genre cliches - people that lose all common sense and will of self-preservation make stupid decisions all the way through the film, it's also full of plot holes and inconsistencies.It's just lazy writing - I have no idea whatsoever why this is getting rave reviews. I don't like writers who have no attention to detail. If you want to see a horror film with attention to detail, watch The Thing, or Alien or any real classic horror film.I'd not watched Get Out yet and watched that last night with the other half and whilst a little predictable in places it was a decent flick.

Not just the plot holes which I wont mention in detail. The atmosphere of the movie is very low as was intended with the developing plot. But some of it logically does not make sense. When you are building a creepy, scary movie the plot has to be believable in the actions and intents of characters. Or you can go the other way to make it a scare jump movie to make you not question it and if done well can work. This just moves on very slowly. Comes to for me a comical climax which tries too hard and does not fit in with the intended suspense of the rest of the film. And the very ending of the movie and I even want to consider it was feasible.4/10 comes from me for the actors and the attempted writing, filming and direction of the movie. Maybe I am missing something but I found overall the film is not very good. Despite all the talent of all the makers of the film. There was a very good film that this could have been maybe. I dont know how so I give praise for the effort put in to it. I am sure all the talent will move on to success. I can see the proffesnialism of all involved will move on to better things.

It also boasts a terrific lead performance by Maika Monroe (last seen in another innovative-yet-retro horror entry, The Guest.)

" Refreshingly Spooky Horror Movie

It Follows goes by an old school approach of less is more. Half the time, we're not even sure if there's anything threatening in the frame, but we sure feel like there is.It Follows tells the story of Jay, a typical American teen, who falls for a boy, they have sex, he knocks her out, and she wakes up in an abandoned building where the boy tells her that he's passed a disease on to her. Oh, but this is no ordinary STD - this one carries a death sentence unless she passes it on before it gets her. Pretty soon, she begins to be followed by many different types of people who are the death curse in disguise.A killer STD is a sort of silly idea for a horror film, but It Follows takes it very seriously and it gets by due to a heavy atmosphere of dread and tension. The score by Disasterpiece helps a lot in conjuring a creepy mood as does the excellent cinematography that calls to mind early John Carpenter.It Follows is practically perfect for the first half of the film, but it does have a few pacing issues by the middle of the film where the ages old ""exposition"" aspect starts going. The characters are also not the most well drawn or nuanced, which hurts a bit of the well crafted tension the film has worked so hard to create. Still, the film manages to work in spite of this.It Follows is an indie film that deserves your attention."

Some of the actors could be a little better, but I really like the group of friends in this film and find most of them to be convincing for the most part. The slower scenes in which they are reminiscing about their childhood or just being there for one another are some of my favorite scenes. I think it's best to watch this movie without knowing what this thing is, so I won't go into details. I'll just say that I find this concept to be terrifying. When it comes to the technical aspects of this film, I love the way this film looks. Whether it's day or night time, I love the look. And lastly, the music in this movie is amazing and terrifying. If you love music from 80's horror films, you'll probably love this soundtrack as well. I really only have one issue with the movie and it's one that others have mentioned. The rules regarding this thing the characters are running from are inconsistent. For better or for worse, the rules aren't consistent or explained outside of an early exposition scene. I don't find the final confrontation scene to be bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. While I'm not completely satisfied with that scene, I do really like the ending to this movie. I do think this film is the most enjoyable on your first viewing when you don't know what's going on. That being said, I still have a great time watching this movie after seeing it four times in the past two years."

",0.0,-0.9818,2019-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I tell people I like horror. But it can be so hard to find a good one. Even one that doesn't ultimately annoy me. Even the ones everyone says are superior kind of annoy me, like The Conjuring. This movie is sort of...the anti-Conjuring.But this one is different. Before watching I had a firm idea of the kind of thing I wanted to see in a horror movie: characters move into new location, uncanny things start to happen, characters only gradually become aware of an incorporeal menace and never fully appreciate the amount of danger they are really in.This turns that around. We are informed very early on who is our enemy. They are tangible, identifiable, a character literally points to it. We know its attributes; it's invisible to everyone but one specific target, it will appear as different things to the one specific target, it cannot be beaten in a fight, but it walks everywhere.We know how it goes about things but not why. And the movie never tells us. There is no lengthy scene searching the web. It gets no name. There are no ""paranormal experts"" popping in to arm us. It's not a supernatural thriller marketed as a horror. This is legit.We are not confined to one area, the movie does not waste time cruising for our sympathy with kids and a dog and a family. We have a bunch of teens that need to keep moving. It's breezy and often somewhat hypnotic with its low key tone with a sense of danger always on the low boil, the sense of dread and urgency still never leaves you. Never. There is also an agreeable utilisation of backgroundsit's not perfect: I feel the movie really spoils its own atmosphere when the follower shows emotions (hissing; why do all horror monsters hiss now?), but it is testimony to the freshness of the movie that I can look past this and still give it 8/10.I don't like the lavatorial stuff either but whatever.I know it became a sort of ""indie darling"" but don't let the pretentious fans put you off.

" How can anyone watch this movie and actually think it makes sense?
",0.0,-0.9936,2019-02-21 00:00:00,3,"I went into this movie pretty excited. I've been on a massive horror binge recently so after hearing so many good things about 'It Follows', I was pumped to see this. Lights off. Midnight. Big TV. Alone. Awesome.What followed was a cluster of utter nonsense, sparse appearances by the least scary monster I've ever seen on screen and plain boring dialogue.First I will say, the soundtrack was decent. Cool 80's carpenter style synth soundtrack, can't go wrong. Apart from it did go wrong, because despite the music itself being really nice, it did not fit the tone of the film at all. I feel a more standard modern orchestral ST would have fit the bill better.Acting was alright. I feel bad for the cast as they didn't exactly have a great script to work with. The characters were boring, vapid middle class kids (?) with absolutely nothing to say to eachother. The friend (not the sister) with the dark hair and glasses - why on earth was she even in this film? What actually was her purpose apart from to make a few ironic remarks and act completely nonchalant about her friend being stalked by whatever the thing was meant to be?Which brings me on to exactly that. The monster. What an ill thought out premise and antagonist. The first scene shows the audience a girl being killed brutally on the beach, her leg almost snapped off and mangled. Awesome, this is going to be horrifying. Nope, we have a monster that WALKS in a straight line until it gets to you and then kills you. Wow alright, so our protagonist surely just gets in a car/bus/taxi/plane/unicycle/skateboard and heads off until it catches up and repeats. Safe. Nope, she decides on multiple occasions to corner herself in an assortment of rooms and buildings so the only defence she has against this monster - fleeing - is rendered impossible. Smart move.So she can't run because she's too preoccupied with cornering herself. So she has another option. Just as it was passed to her, she can bang someone else and then the monster will follow them instead. BUT if the next person is killed then it will just go backwards through the chain of sex partners killing them all. So cool we have some rules on how this thing operates. This is what confuses me. So the guy who slept with her to pass on this curse knows this, and tells her this, because he had it passed on by some other girl. A one night stand he says, where he was so drunk that he cannot even remember her name. So how on earth does he know all this??? He was drunk to the point he can't remember her name but somehow she told him about this curse and he can remember that? What? I'm assuming he wasn't told by this fleeting partner, as surely he would have tracked her down, so has he just figured this out somehow? Absolutely stupid nonsensical was of explaining the rules to the audience.The film goes on like this until the end. Every 5 minutes watching this film I found myself saying 'What?' out loud.Why did she sleep with the random sleezy guy in the HOSPITAL??? Was he that desperate to bang her? Like surely this guy would stay well away even if there was an inkling that what she was saying was true.Why the hell did the other dude (the 'nice' guy) sleep with her later on??? To show how much he cared about her??? Absolutely obscene.That ending... wow... why on earth did they think it was a good idea to put her in a swimming pool and surround the pool in assorted electrical devices and plug it in? So they could lure the monster in and electrocute it? What could possibly go wrong? The dude at the beginning who gave her the curse even said 'its slow but not stupid'. The monster wasn't stupid, but the characters certainly were.Where were the parents in this movie? 5 kids running around up and down the country, windows getting smashed, car crashes, one of them even gets shot. What the hell?My favourite part of this movie was when the leads friend asked her 'what does it look like?' and she says 'I don't wanna tell you'. Here I was thinking we were going to see some absolutely rotten vile monster. It was a well kempt dude in shorts. Wow. Scary stuff.Honestly I'm done writing about this, this is the first review I've written but I was just so appalled by its own stupidity that I felt impulsed to write my thoughts out.Don't watch this film. It stinks."

It has the decency to have mostly nice likeable young characters.Jay Height (Maika Monroe) is a pretty teenager who has sex with her new boyfriend. He then ties her up and in a desolate house tells her that he has passed a curse on to her.Some kind of malevolent entity will now follow her, it can be anyone and it will try to kill her. The only way out for her is to pass the curse along to someone else and hopefully they will transmit it forward.Jay is troubled, soon she has visions of someone following her. Her friends and family are worried about Jay but rally around her. Yet they cannot see what Jay is seeing.The film can be seen as an allegory of the consequences of promiscuous sex and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. The premise of passing on a curse can go back to cult films such as Night of the Demon by Jacque Tourneur.Writer/Director David Robert Mitchell begins the film with a half naked young woman running scared out of her house in heels. Her dead contorted body is found on the beach. Outside of this he has gone for slow burn suspense rather than visceral horror.The use of electronic music and going for jump scares reminded me of the early movies of John Carpenter."

" Kind of atmospheric, I guess...
",0.0,0.9901,2019-01-29 00:00:00,6,"While the lead performances here are fine, I must say the characters in this film are pretty dull. A couple of them have silly quirks - Jay plays with grass a lot and Yara has an e-reader shaped like a clam - but that's it. The premise of Jay being stalked after inheriting a demon through sexual intercourse is neat though, but the problem is in the execution.I think this film is boring. It screams teen angst, and it's full of awkward teenager stuff like sitting around cross-legged drinking beer, smoking, and talking about first kisses and running away. 'It' is a clever horror concept with clear rules that also encourages you to watch the backgrounds of scenes, but I don't understand the reasoning behind the forms It takes - why does It look like naked people, or a woman peeing herself? I'm also not sure I understand what the climactic swimming pool scene was all about - what was Paul's plan with the electrical appliances (and why didn't it work?), why does It survive, why do Jay and Paul have sex after, and why does this film have so many swimming pools anyway?On the plus side, the production is incredibly slick. It's very nicely shot (with some impressive 360° camera shots), and the score is wonderfully eerie and not relied upon too much - very good use is made of silence.Obviously there are sexual undercurrents to It, which reminds of an STD, but I feel like I'm missing something else. There are a lot of quotations from books that the writer probably thought sounded deep, and water seems to be a recurring motif with numerous scenes at either swimming pools or the coast. I'm not sure what the deal is with that kid that keeps spying on Jay either.The gorgeous cinematography and score are the only things that make this film worth watching for me. It has its moments, and there is a fairly unsettling atmosphere, but it's also pretty boring watching teenagers talk about sex and their childhoods in between those.6/10."

",-0.5684,-0.8532,2019-01-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie is overrated and the rating imbd have is unfair and way too high, the only reason i watched the movie is because of the ratings on here. I want the ratings to go down it's like clickbait. The ratings at most should at around 3 to 4.Don't watch easily on my top 10 list of worst horror movies i've ever watched."
" Have I watched the wrong movie?
",-0.4767,-0.7134,2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"I never write reviews but I have to for this one. It's overrated as hell. I really feel like I've watched another film - this film was boring, predictable, generic - the direction and script was bad and boring, the acting was bad too... It's not scary, it's not unique or special, nor is it horrifying. It's also not a slow burning film which has its wow moment at any time.I've just waisted my time on this - please don't do the same."
" Original and unique
",0.3182,0.3864,2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I really loved how they managed to bring some fresh air to a genre that is full of repetitive and not original movies. Basically this is like any The Ring, The Grudge movie, but they managed to obtain an original title with a genial idea, of having a monsters without a real face, but multiple aspect. This movie will give you genuine chills, and leaves you with a uncomfortable feeling."
" A good homage to the slasher sub genre.
",0.4404,0.7796,2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"This is a good movie, and I can appreciate it more for it's atmosphere. It pays homage to the slasher flick with it's soundtrack filled with synths. The way the film looks is very 80's esque which adds to it. I thoughlly enjoy all including when they're running away from ""It"" that try's to kill them at times, the opening shot and ending scene are very intriguing and messed up in the best way. The cinematography is also done very good, the shots linger and hang on to the scene and it's cool. The scene that get me is the scene when she's touching a flower and then she gets kidnapped, that legitimately scared me. Now enough praise, there's something that this movie fails in, suspense. The suspense is lower GREATLY due to the fact that it's literally an invisible and slow creature. Something about that greatly lowers the film, the acting is either passable or at times good, the characters are forgettable aside from the main character and that one skinny guy. Aside from simply knowing them, they have no unique character traits. In conclusion, it's still a good film to look at and become submerged in but certain qualities and can take you out of it. 8/10"

" Very unusual, but intriguing and highly original horror movie.
",-0.4728,0.9926,2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,"This is a very unusual horror-movie. There's no gore, no slashings, no jumps-scares, so it's probably not every horror-fans cup of tea (as the mixed reviews clearly indicate), but I have to say that I was very much intrigued throughout the whole film. Sure, there are some things to say against it: the pace is extremely slow, the dialogues are sparse, there's hardly any action (save an unexpected very chilling action-scene in a swimming-pool in the last 15 minutes), there are in the end no answers or decent solutions to the mystery. I can imagine that some will consider it boring.But - at least in my opinion - there is much more to say in its favor. It's absolutely original (which is quite an achievement in the nowadays over-saturated horror-market) and the atmosphere is haunting, thanks to the inventive direction, the beautiful photography and a very effective, chilling musical score. The characters - a group of adolescent kids - interrelate more by stoically hanging out together than by words and all behave for most part of the movie as in slow motion, which enhances the weird, dreamlike feeling that this whole project creates. As does the facts that there are never any parents in sight, that the kids constantly watch old scifi movies from the fifties and sixties on television and that one of them - a girl of about 15 - reads The Idiot by Dostojewsky on a pink shell-shaped e-reader and every now and then quotes some lines from it to the rest.The premise (girl gets ""infected"" by her boyfriend with a supernatural force in the form of weird appearances that follow and threaten her, and from then her friends try to help her to get rid of it) grants for some weird and creepy moments, culminating in the aforementioned climax in a deserted swimming pool. But I got the distinct feeling that there was more to this story than just the horror-aspects, it seemed as if there were many metaphores that I coulnd't quite put my finger on. Something to do with sexually coming of age, I guess, since the sexual ""deed"" played such a pivotal role in the transmitting of the curse and so many of the apparitions had clearly sexual connotations.The acting is over-all rather restrained, but especially Maika Monroe as the tormented Jay does a great job. And I would also like to mention Keir Gilchrist. His character behaves so subdued and reactive that it doesn't give much room to shine, but he does magic with his body language and his face. I saw him before in Heartthrob where he has a leading part, that movie wasn't great but Gilchrist sure was!All in all I was very much intrigued and entertained and I rank it 8 out of 10."
" Awesome!
",0.6588,0.4914,2019-01-08 00:00:00,10,"My favorite horror film of the last 10 years! Really well plotted and paced. I'm a big fan of films that understand how to pace the action to bring out the drama or the horror or the comedy or whatever it is. It reminded me of the best of the early 70s and 80s horror films when editing was less erratic, which is sometimes an excuse for dull content. This was shot perfectly to really bring out the shocks and scares. Also a beautiful and haunting soundtrack. Looking forward to seeing the new film from David Robert Mitchell."
" not bad, not great
",0.6754,-0.0691,2019-01-06 00:00:00,5,"So, this was on Film4 the other day so I decided to give it a watch and as you can tell by the title. It's not bad, but it also isn't great. And here's why:So, quick rundown, a young woman develops a curse after sleeping with her date and in order to get rid of it she has to sleep with someone else. If the ""demon"" kills that person it then goes back to whoever is previous again.I will start with what personally annoyed me. We have this curse that the young woman got quite early on in the film. However, I would have liked some sort of explanation as to why this curse exists. Also, Jay (young woman) could have simply slept with some random lad in a bar and so on, but she fannies about for a while, because finally sleeping with another lad. At the end she ends up sleeping with one of her best friends who then hires a prostitute (which is what i suggested about 15 minutes into the film). But, clearly the prostitute dies, because the ""demon"" is following them again. That ending seems a little pointless, because I have watched 100 minutes of a film to find out, they are still cursed....There are definitely positives to take from this film, the acting I thought, especially for a low budget horror, was pretty decent. The cinematography was also very good, some nice shots were used throughout and the music was different, but I believe worked well with the overall tone of this horror.So, why do people watch horror films? To get scared. Watching this, there was definitely an element of constant horror as you never know whether this ""demon"" will appear as it would follow the character at random times. There was also some jump scares thrown into the mix so yeah I would say this definitely has that horror element. The idea of being constantly followed and watched is a current zeitgeist that bothers a lot of people and they have incorporated that well.I have given this a 5/10, because overall I believe it's simply just an average film. You won't be disappointed by it, nor will you be impressed."
" One of the worst movies I've see
",-0.6249,-0.9645,2019-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I think this could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. For starters, it is incredibly unclear when it is set... which makes the clothing, music and furniture etc. very confusing and just bad... There is no explanation as to why this occurs... and the ending is just terrible. It's just a bunch of randy teenagers or early 20's (maybe? Because it's also unclear how old everyone is)... and who the hell is that tall guy?"
" It Follows...Slowly, Wonkily, Nonsensically.
",0.0,-0.836,2019-01-03 00:00:00,4,"First the good. There's a decent premise/concept: A disturbing human form phantasm/chimera passes from human host A to murderously (if incredibly slowly) stalk human host B after sex between A and B. The only way to arrest the menace is for B to pass it on to C - also through the act of intercourse. If C is killed by 'it', the pesky illusory menace returns to make life a headache for person B - so B has to find a D or die horribly. Or something like that. Also good - It's actually well shot, and lovingly captures suburban Detroit with some fine detail. Also good is its obvious homage to John Carpenter's Halloween, along with a fine, off-kilter score. Also pretty good - a decent and willing cast that handle the angst of teenage hood shifting to the dread of adulthood.So that's the good out of the way.Then there's the not so good. It's not really a horror in the traditional way - which is nothing to be ashamed of - but it's neither particularly scary or in anyway satisfying if it's trying to be a psychological horror, promising and intriguing prologue aside.Given the premise of the film (and the early buzz raving about it), I was expecting something at least on a par with the original Ring - a film that is properly freaky. But It Follows settles for neither intensely freaky/disturbing or all out nightmarish scares.You just sit there waiting for the scares to arrive and the 'It' needle barely registers close to mildly creepy. As the camera moves, you find your eyes wandering into the background to see if you can spot anything that will give you sleepless nights for a week only to find there is n-o-t-h-i-n-g there. There's no Mulholland Drive freak you out Bonnie Aarons behind the dumpster, no Don't Look Now Adelina Poerio in a red raincoat. If you're going trope hunting - this ain't that film. No psycho in a William Shatner mask either. Sorry.Probably the most disturbing thing about It Follows is it's resolute refusal to make any real sense as it assiduously and deliberately avoids to cow-tow to the requirements to make a film genuinely memorable or scary. Explanations are treated with disdain, logic is given short shrift, there's absolutely no attempt at a real time revelation, and an utterly and woefully ambiguous ending that comes across as nothing more than one of those dreadful decisions by a director to 'make it more fun' and missing by planetary distance.The only reason why I think a lot of critics liked this film so much is on account of exactly what the director didn't do and given him a of huge amount of latitude in producing a film that could be interpreted as something that it patently is not. In film critic's universe - this is called original or imaginative or fresh. But in avoiding entirely the A-Z of 'How To Scare The Living Hell Out Of Me' - the film pretty much throws out the entire language required do precisely that."
" Original and creepy
",0.3182,-0.5551,2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"What a fun twist on the horror genre! Similar to Night of the Living Dead, the ""monsters"" in this movie move slowly, very slowly and that is precisely what creates the tension. Even though the story is set in present day, it has a 1980's feel that I love. While it's a horror film with plenty of creepiness and plenty of jump scares, it also has some great metaphors about sex and STD's (if you choose to read into it, but I'm not sure how you can't). The lead actress has something about her that's very appealing and I expect we'll see her in more."

There were just way toooo many plot holes; we never learn the origin of ""it"", how did it kill the 1st victim so viciously, what was up with the water theme and for them to still be living at home y did we never see any parents?? I wouldn't really call this a horror film tho, it just wasn't bloody or honestly that scary (I'm easy to scare). I don't understand all the high praise it received minus the idea of something like this following you. With a few tweaks could've been pretty revolutionary, as it is, it falls short."

Compared to other horror films with a sex theme, it can be praised for its avoidance of over-the-top gore as well as sexual exploitation.It may not necessarily advance the genre but it's mildly entertaining.

It's like the filmmakers knew their actors were terrible and their dialogue was awful, so they avoided having the characters talk as much as possible. The plot doesn't make sense and it is constantly breaking its own rules. The stalking monster is creepy in theory, but around the third or fourth time the characters run away from it, the premise gets old.

" The worst kind of STD...
",-0.6249,-0.867,2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"The plot is simple yet interesting. Someone has sex with someone else and an STD monster stalks them. It walks like a Romero-esque zombie but no matter how far you travel, it keeps coming for you. If it touches you, you're dead. If it kills you, it goes after whoever passed the curse to you. I don't feel like this is a spoiler because they basically explain it in the first twenty minutes of the film.I had heard it was good and although it had its flaws, it was pretty cool. Yeah, the parents seem to be absent (so were mine) and yes, the rules are bent slightly here and there but I mean, were you expecting The Godfather? It's a stupid horror film. If you can believe in an STD monster, your suspension of disbelief should probably allow your brain to fill in the blanks and get passed the glitches of the film. In short, get over it. It's entertaining and it's more thought out than anything Michael Bay has pumped out...ever.I think this is one of the better horror films of the decade (not the best,) considering it's up against the 15th Saw flick (only the 10th since the villain died,) Paranormal Conjuring Nuns that Purge and all its spin offs and various other PG-13 ""scary movies"" as well as a countless barrage of remakes and sequels. At least this film is different and had some balls (it's rated R.) Not great, but worth watching. I still say The Babadook and Get Out are better (along with a few more) but this was better than most recent schlock. Give it a shot."

I really thought the whole idea behind this movie sounded dumb, so didn't bother watching it before. After hearing so many good things about it though, I decided to give it a chance, and this one got to me. I grew up watching horror movies, and never really get nightmares, but this one gave me chills. I could barely sleep that night after watching.I won't give any spoilers, but knowing there is something out there constantly slowly following you,and will not stop until it gets you, no matter where you go really freaks me out. I wouldn't say it's the best horror movie, but it is one of the better ones I've seen today. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, not much CGI, has a good soundtrack, the acting is decent, and is not an 'in your face' type of horror. It's just chilling, which gets to me more than anything.Everyone's different.. I'm sure there are people that would find it lame, or boring... But if you're like me, and it's the little things that scare you instead of monsters jumping out at the screen at you.. Then I think you would like. Even if you're not a fan of the story, this movie definitely has it's moments, and some creepy scenes. Would recommend"

" A Major Disappointment!
",-0.5562,0.953,2018-10-18 00:00:00,4,"I wouldn't normally even bother to review a film already critiqued by 800+ contributors, but I was so disappointed by It Follows that I found myself gravitating towards the keyboard, to express my feelings of surprised dismay.Touted regularly as a ""modern classic"", those expecting another genuinely original film such as Get Out! should be prepared for disappointment.The main narrative premise of a ""viral villainous curse"" passed between teenagers, has most obviously and best been seen in The Ring saga. The story therefore can claim no great pretensions to originality. But the way it is presented to the audience is completely and frustratingly daft.Consider: 1 The virtual complete absence of adult support characters. These school going teenagers have apparently no parents from whom to seek advice or get some help. They appear to just about all live in Jay's house. Convenient I suppose, but realistic? 2 The (adult) police can't find Hugh/Jeffrey, but our teenage posse can. Sure! 3 Many have already noted the absence of any explanation at all for the existence of the curse (a major point of difference with The Ring). I could probably live with that, but curiously again there seems little police involvement with the associated deaths, such as we see in the film's introduction. 4 Jay's continually bizarre behaviour is something to behold. She always seems to be running out on her buddies, even when they get shot/injured attempting to help her with naturally, precious little thanks. 5 And what's with the two main male friends trying to bed Jay when they know she's been cursed? One even quite hilariously mounts her in her hospital bed, when she's recovering from a car crash. Shades of David Lynch! It makes little sense. 6 As do the ""its"", when in one scene bullets to the head cause only a minor inconvenience, whilst in another scene, we're expected to believe it's finished one off. Duh! 7 As for the so called symbolism of ""purposely"" highlighted superseded technologies and SF/Horror references ... seriously what was the point? In your face stuff, that's all been done before in much better films.It follows therefore that I strongly advise you don't bother."

Oh well, knocked it down to a 6/10. Still worth checking out!"

The opening scene sets your expectations pretty high, but the actual movie fails to deliver. They seemingly blew their effects budget on that opening scene, because that's as gory as it gets. For the rest of the movie the dread is rooted in a slow, unstoppable force slowly walking after the protagonist. So the movie is a slow burn. These teens aren't very bright either, so there really is no resolution or insight into what the antagonist even is.The cinematography was good, and the acting was decent given what they had to work with.

" I just can't
",0.0,-0.9932,2018-10-09 00:00:00,2,"I have seen some reviews say that the concept is original. There is nothing original about the concept of ridding yourself of a curse by passing it on to the next unsuspecting victim. I suppose it is a tiny bit original that this curse is passed on for sex? Actually, no. STD are passed on this way in real life. Which brings me to the issue of informed consent. Knowingly having sex with someone in order to pass on, in this case, a curse without first informing the person that you have the affliction is called assault. It happens all the time in real life and it's not ok. Nothing original about it. I'm just saying.Speaking of sex, you have to pass the curse on by sex, and then ""It"" kills people by having sex with them, apparently? It just feels like sex for the sake of sex if there's no explanation. It's the dumbest premise of all time. I just can't. The whole thing is just boring, boring, boring. I get that it's a formulaic approach, but most horrors like this at least go on to investigate the origin of the evil thing. Why does it kill? Why does it kill in the way that it does? These questions keep the viewer at least interested in the story. Here, there is no story. All we have is some girl running, with the help of her friends, from an entity that walk super slow. There is nothing engaging. No exploration of who might be patient zero or what is ""It's"" motivation. I didn't find ""It"" to be the least bit scary. I mean, if people can easily outrun it at a speed walking pace, I'm just not that scared. ""It"" moves so ungodly slow, and apparently only does so by walking, that it would be easy enough to just jump on a plane, fly across the ocean, and wait for it to make it's slow a** way across the seas. I know, I know. Not everyone can just pick up and move half way around the world. But if I had some unseen murderous entity bent on killing me, I'd do what it takes. People move around all the time for less compelling reasons. If you can't make it across the world, just a couple hours drive will do to get a good night's rest. Maybe find a job that requires you to fly around the country a lot. See? A little bit of reasoning takes the fear factor right out.The plan to kill this thing makes absolutely no sense. At the beach, she shoots it and it just stands up and keeps coming. What makes them think electrocution will do the trick if bullets won't? And what exactly is the plan anyway? ""It"" is only getting in the pool if Jay is there, so in order to electrocute it, don't they have to electrocute her? I guess maybe if she's fast enough she can swim to the edge and get out first, but it just seems like an ill-thought-through plan.I guess Maika Monroe at least does a good job with what she's given. With a plot that revolves solely around a chick running around screaming like a lunatic at an entity that only she can see, this easily could have devolved into ""please just kill her already so as to spare us all from this annoyance"" territory, but it really didn't. Maika managed to not grind on my nerves. Plus one in the acting column. That's why this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1. But that is literally all this film has going for it."
" Creative, refreshing and scary

The general sense of dread is compelling as the characters are in constant danger and the movie is bloated with ""blink and you'll miss it"" moments, which sometimes are the scariest in the film. Sometimes the nudity is distasteful but it helps with the unsettling nature of the film's antagonist- the creepy ""never-stop-walking"" entity.

" Confused, half hearted ""horror""
",-0.3182,-0.7003,2018-09-03 00:00:00,2,"Rubbish storyline that has huge holes in it, leaving a mess with no satisfactory ending. Wooden acting and terrible camera work. A complete waste."
" I'm Sorry, But This Movie is Stupid
",-0.6956,-0.9879,2018-08-31 00:00:00,3,"You sometimes come across a horror movie that is so ridiculous by concept that one wonders why it was even made in the first place. It Follows is one of them. While I kind of get the critical acclaim and cult status behind the film, it left me so befuddled from its execution that I ended up laughing at it more than feeling genuinely scared. The general storyline revolves around a teenage girl named Jay, who is constantly chased around by a supernatural spirit after having sexual intercourse. I can see where the premise could've worked, but having a curse brought up from mating makes the film come off as more stupid than creepy. Maybe if it were a blood oath that started it, I'd be more intrigued, but that ain't what we got. In addition, the pacing is rather monotonous, as we spend roughly half the movie on Jay and her friends running away, while also trying to stop the creature. I think half of that time should've been spent on learning about the mythos of the curse itself.Where the story is too bizarre for a horror film, the characters range from bland, to annoying to even dumb. The actors are certainly trying their best, but we don't know much about Jay's friends outside of them having feelings for her and one or two quirks. Even Jay herself becomes so anxious about where the entity comes from that....well, let's just say she makes too many stupid decisions for her own good. BTW, when I say some of Jay's friends have feelings towards her, I ain't kidding. Without giving anything away, given that the curse comes from an STD, Jay at the very least feels bad for what she has to do to save herself, so I'll give credit and say that there is some genuine sympathy in her.Another annoying factoid of the film is the soundtrack. I understand that it's supposed to make the audience feel as tense as Jay, and sometimes it pays off well. However, there are several moments where music is unneeded, and silence would've been more than enough. Also, some moments play scores that are way too loud and over the top, making the scenes feel too pretentious for their own good. Lastly, probably the film's worst offender is that it doesn't really end, it just sort of stops. I'm not saying all stories need to end off on a bang, but it was nonetheless very anticlimactic. Maybe it's a setup for a sequel, but it's still frustrating nonetheless.Overall, It Follows had the makings of a decent horror flick, but its ludicrous concept makes it too laughable to be taken seriously, and the characters don't offer much in terms of substance. If you're into original films that at least offer intriguing ideas that stand out from the typical horror fare, then by all means check this out. However, if you can't take the concept with sincerity, then don't even bother. I do respect the filmmakers behind this for bringing their unique visions to life, but just because something is unique doesn't mean it'll work out in the end."
" Refreshing
",0.0,0.8327,2018-08-29 00:00:00,7,"From the very beginning It Follows is cool, unique and fresh. The soundtrack is reminiscent of Stranger Things and with the help of some fantastic camerawork we can really allow ourselves to feel as trapped as our protagonist. Overall a really enjoyable experience, that doesn't take itself too seriously, but unfortunately not one that will have you hiding under your bed covers. The whole movie moved at a fast pace and although it would have been nice to learn some more about the characters, a long scene purely devoted to character development could have potentially destroyed the unending tension that had been built up. It's nice to see some good filmmaking brought into this degenerating genre: it feels like it was made for a purpose; not a profit."

" Good but could be better
",0.7003,0.3526,2018-07-31 00:00:00,7,"It Follows is one of the many examples of modern horror movies that serves as an allegory for a contempory social issue, and at that, it does quite a good job. Where it falls off for me is in the execution of some of the scares and character choices. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about this movie. I particularly was intruiged by the premise of a ""sexually transmitted demon"" as well as how the demon can disguise itself. There are some amazing scenes of tension in which we see a person in the distance slowly approaching the main characters. Also the idea that the demon can disguise itself as anyone and be anywhere is truly terrifying if used in the proper setting such as a crowded area. However, the director/writer opted for the demon to be incredibly conspicuous for almost every scene where it would appear as a creepy old woman or demonic looking child. It seems like the director might have had pressure to make the movie more appealing to the mainstream audience so he had to water down his premise. I also took issue with some of the choices the characters make. We're told that the group of teens are very smart but then see them sit in an open field with their backs exposed to the demon. I personally feel like this was simply lazy writing to set up a scare. This makes it hard to root for the main character because at every turn, she does the least logical option often resulting in her getting nearly attacked by the demon. Overall, this movie is good, but I just think some elements of it could be done better. That being said, it's worth checking out for fans of the genre."

",-0.3595,-0.9303,2018-07-02 00:00:00,3,"After a promising opening the rest of the film takes a trip down boredom lane, even though the title suggests something sinister. For a horror/thriller (or any genre for that matter) the film has a very lazy feel about it. According to the decor, wallpaper and TV's I assume the film is set in the 80s, but the girl in the opening scene has a cell phone. Nothing about this film makes sense, not the plot nor the character's behavior. Why did Hugh tie Jay to a wheelchair after giving 'it' to her? Why did he drug her in the first place, since by that time he'd already given it to her? This entire scene was just plain dumb. From there the film just gets more vague and silly. What is 'it' and why is it following people (at a snail's pace, I might add). What is the purpose of all this? To make the plot more laughable, 'it' is passed on by having sex. What?? A sexually transmitted demon??? Sounds like a Sunday school story!!The hospital sex scene is unenthusiastic and totally inappropriate. When Jay finally tracks down Hugh, he couldn't be more vague about what's going on, and NO-ONE even bothers to ask what 'it' is and what it wants?????! This 'it' demon is also the most passive demon I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention slow and utterly stupid. There isn't a single scare in the movie. I couldn't wait for it to end. Firstly, because I really wanted it to end. Secondly, because I wanted to know how it would end, I suppose. The film then ends on just as lazy a note as it's been for the past 90 minutes, no climax whatsoever. Critics praised the film. Uhm....why?? Am I missing something here?"

The cinematography in this movie is a style I personally really enjoy, so I thought the movie as a whole looked great. I didn't have as much of an issue with ""the scene"" that most people seem to have an issue with. It isn't the most well written scene in the entire movie, but I think it fits the movie well and when I was watching it I never thought it was detracting from the story. I was surprisingly pleased with the quality of the acting, but with a good director anything's possible. All movies start at a neutral rating of 5 for me, and this movie goes up to a solid 9. That 9 is well deserved, because this movie has great music, writing, acting, and more than anything, cinematography.

Still creepy, paced well, and I like that it makes you ask the ""could you live with yourself"" question.
 I knew when I watched The Ring that I could pass along a copy of a tape to save myself. No question. 
I don't know how anyone wouldn't be 'followed' by passing along the ghost/curse in this film.
That's why I have to give credit to a film that redrew the line of morality vs survival.
TL;DR it's messed up and possibly has a tired old message but I think it did ask for more thought on how much effecting others effects ourselves. 
Zovatto deserves credit for his acting but his last scene is deeply disturbed...go watch him in something else"
" Creative concept but not executed very well.
",-0.1522,0.9374,2018-06-13 00:00:00,3,"I thought this would be a good horror movie because it had a lot of great reviews saying that true horror fans would love it. I consider myself to be a pretty big horror fan but I didn't not love this movie. The whole premise is creative and original but they didn't really pull it off. It wasn't a terrible movie but in terms of being a horror movie, it is definitely not good. Spoilers coming...First of all, it wasn't even scary. Pretty sure that's the point of a horror movie. Maybe they weren't going for surprises that get people to jump out of their seats, but a good horror movie will have people dying of anticipation for several minutes straight, at least somewhere near the end. This movie was not scary in the slightest except for some of the acting (Maika Monroe was good though). The idea of a sexually transmitted curse or whatever is very interesting and original but some things about ""it"" are just stupid. I don't mind the walking. Some of the greatest horror movie villains walk (Michael Myers). But if you can drive away to buy some time, couldn't you fly to Hawaii and never have to worry about it again? Also it apparently can take the form of someone you love but they failed to capitalize on that by having it do that early when the main character doesn't believe in what's happening yet and potentially having a close call with death. The only times it does this are basically pointless to the story. I don't understand why they tried to kill it at the pool. Didn't she shoot it in the neck or head at the lake? And it just got right back up. Overall, not an awful movie, but it was an awful horror movie. I'll give it three stars just for the creativity."

I was very confused what time era we were supposed to be seeing. Was it the 70's? 80s? 90s? Current times? Very hard to tell. I think it was supposed to be the 70s, but some things did not belong in that era. Then there's the scene with the ""broken"" girl on the beach. That was the only good part of the movie, although, I am kind of wondering how does a leg stick up like that when you're dead? Isn't there a thing called gravity? And who was that girl? I'm so confused.Then there's the premise: there's a curse, and it can be passed on through sex. But how or why? And could you pass the curse on to someone else or can't you? It didn't seem to work. So why did they keep trying? Where did the curse originate? Who were the people who would come after the infected? Were they ghosts? Ghosts of the previous victims? Now that might make sense.

Let's talk about the monster (monster? ghost? demon?). The concept is cool and almost scary until you realize he (she? it?) is pointless just like the entire movie. At least It Follows, right? Well, sometimes it does, most of the times it simply does not. Does not stop the camera from filming some empty place where the monster is SUPPOSED to be, but sadly it is slow af so it probably can't make it there for another half an our (actual screentime, not ""movie time"" half an our). Thinking about it, the only reason it is remotely dangerous because our sleepwalking lead never takes any precaution to avoid it.

It's a slow-burn with a keen focus on tone that prefers building genuine suspense over portraying overt gore. It's the deft handling of a unique 'monster', one steeped in - but not consumed by - allegory, that allows it to be as effecting as it is, with the inherently scary premise combining with it's arresting visuals and superb score to a suitably subtle but certainly supreme effect. 8/10"

I saw one moron say that if you don't like this movie, its because you only like horror movies that make you ""jump"".

I loved the movie ""The Babadook"" because their were 3 scenes that sent chills down my spine without trying to make me jump at all.But ""It Follows"" is just not scary at all. The only thing slightly frighening was the appearances of a couple of the forms ""It"" takes on. On top of not being scary, its just not a well put-together movie. There are some really poor transitions from one scene to the next, characters make decisions that make little or no sense, and a few scenes just made me wonder ""what the hell is going on in this movie right now??""The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1/10 is that, unfortunately, there are bigger pieces of crap out there (see ""The Invitation"" or ""Open House).

It was well acted and suspenseful with enough jump screens to make it worthwhile for those who enjoy more action in their horror films.

I originally expected that the STD demon would be someone just in a crowd or in the form of someone Jay knew. Usually the watcher could tell who the demon was because they were not blending into the crowd and were easily identifiable. Take the grandma in the scene at the school. When else will there be a little old lady at the school in her nightgown. There also was a lot of random shots that really didn't help the movie for example the scene were she was at the lake/beach and saw the boat it shows her getting undressed and walking into the water then it shows her driving the car sopping wet. Also there was no indication that there were any parents involved in the whole movie. Where were Jays parents or any of the other kids. When they were running from the demon they never went far which in my mind is dumb. The demon was slow moving at most times so why not go farther away then where they were going and why go to open places. The last thing I didn't really like was how did the demon not get Jay while she was in the hospital for three days can it not enter the hospital? The movie does keep you wanting to keep watching it but it has a lot of parts that make completely no sense and in my opinion were probably just added to make the movie longer.
" Seriously

" Why is it so highly rated?????
",0.0,-0.7935,2018-04-14 00:00:00,1,"I love the horror/thriller/supernatural genre. And I love it when filmmakers come up with new innovative ideas. But I absolutely hated this movie. I watched it twice and tried watching a few other times but I was totally and completely bored out of my mind. There was nothing interesting or scary about any part of the movie. I don't need slashing or gore to enjoy horror. I actually prefer movies that keep me on the edge of my seat, guessing and anticipating what's coming next. I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I wasn't guessing. I wasn't anticipating anything but the end of the movie. I was waiting for the entire movie for 1 single frightening thing to happen. After the 1st viewing I just knew that I had to have missed something so I waited a week or so and watched it again. Same results. The other times I tried watching it, I gave up...out of total and complete boredom...I can't reiterate the total and complete boredom part of my review enough. It was pretentious and I think that some people jumped on the bandwagon because it was the ""it"" movie at the time. The only message that it had was ""don't have sex or you'll catch something"". Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching this movie."
" A curse that slowly and relentlessly gets to you
",-0.5423,-0.3278,2018-04-06 00:00:00,6,"David Robert Mitchell had a brilliant idea outlined for a horror film, one that has been commended for its originality leaving other modern films of the genre two steps behind.""It Follows"" revolves around a young girl, Jamie, who spends her time with her boyfriend, Hugh. One night after a date, they get intimate in the car, when suddenly Hugh knocks her out unconscious by using chloroform. She wakes up tied to a chair in an abandoned building where Hugh explains to her that she is now cursed and that no matter when or where, a supernatural entity will slowly follow here until it reaches her and consumes her. It is revealed that the curse can be lifted if she has sexual relations with someone else, therefore passing the curse to the other person. From here on, with the help or her friends, Jamie tries to figure out what to do next.
Maika Monroe gave a great performance as Jamie, having the puzzled appearance of a teenager trapped with her own demons.The idea of an entity following you restlessly until it gets to you is great. The fact that it can appear as anyone at any time, family member or random person on the street, makes it even more scarier. My only concern is that the way it was transmitted, by sexual encounter, and the plot involving teenagers adds up to what's typically a horror movie cliche. Naturally, you will be expected to see a lot of dumb decisions of that nature throughout the film.The film's pace is slow accompanied by eery music and it loses its focus here and there giving the movie a prolonged and jarring feeling. It definitely has some good moments, like the fact that the audience doesn't know if the person that walks towards the cursed one is a normal human being or the supernatural entity. That right there brings out more scares and excitement than the overused jump scares.""It Follows"" does not shape up in to a scary film, in a true ""cover your eyes"" way, instead it gives a feeling of petrifying terror about to hit at any moment. Mitchell's subject is not for everyone's liking, but it can be a surprise for some."

" I don't really think this is a modern masterpiece, it really isn't sorry :(
",0.8058,0.9954,2018-03-22 00:00:00,4,"Yeah Idk, if this is one of the best of the past few years, the horror genre is most definitely in the toilet right now. Not that there's never any quality films being released, but the feces always seems to float to the top for some reason. Must be the average horror director's diet I guess; a combination of bad teenage actors, a poorly written script, a super weird concept, and just a sense of wasted time has never sat well in my stomach. Not that this film was garbage by any means, because it really isn't, but it just hit too many beats and missed too many marks for it to be a good movie. I'll start with the strongest characteristic of the film which was most definitely the camerawork. The way it spins around the environment at a fixed point is incredibly eerie and pretty smart too. Generally, there's at least a few extras in the setting who happen to be walking towards the camera (which is the main shtick here - Maika Monroe has been ""infected"" with this weird occurrence where an entity disguised as a random person follows her slowly until it finally catches up and kills her after she had sex with a man already ""infected.""), and I was always franticly searching for the one with blacked out eyes. The constant extended zooms and pans were very unnerving and gave an air of admonishment. This alone puts it above a bunch of horror movies in that it has a creative concept in how it's filmed, and it uses this concept professionally in order to obtain what it wants. I also want to praise the fact that this film did get my heart beating a few times without using a jumpscare (even though a few were used throughout, they really could have been removed). And lastly, while the concept was weird, it was pretty original and I think if it were executed better it would have been an intriguing movie. And that's about it for praise. So maybe the biggest downfall was that it was so boooooring. The blood-pumping scenes are so few and far between and the space in between is filled with blasé dialogue about ""Hey whadda we do guys?"" ""Idk man! I'm scared!"" ""AAAAAAAAAAA."" Or actually, scratch that, the biggest downfall was that this movie gave the sense that it thought it was way more important and way better than it actually was, similar to It Comes At Night from last year as well. This is just any other schlocky horror film except that it looks nice. Really! If you closed your eyes, would the dialogue and ambience be enough to carry it? I can at least appreciate a movie like Happy Death Day, also from last year, for having fun with the material even though the material is a cheap knock-off of Groundhog Day. At least it doesn't have a pretentious miasma masking it attempting to make me feel like I'm watching some horror masterpiece. If it's a masterpiece, it just will be - no need to try and convince me it is. A masterpiece certainly wouldn't have CGI that just looked this awful for some reason? A masterpiece wouldn't make the antagonist so GOOFy lookin the way it walks. A masterpiece would have a more climatic ending that didn't rehash an attempted solution that had already failed like three times already in the movie! Go watch The VVitch if you want a good modern horror film that takes itself seriously. Or rather, go watch Happy Death Day for a fun, shlock-embraced mess."
" It Disappoints
",-0.3818,-0.9856,2018-03-19 00:00:00,4,"After hearing reviews raving about this as an exciting new horror which was properly scary I watched with anticipation of a change from all the many, many modern horrors with their lame ideas, lack of invention and lack of proper scares. Sadly all I found was that this is basically exactly like all the other weak modern efforts at horror. I cannot understand what reviewers had seen in it. Right from the start the film shows itself to be the typical cliched silly teen horror and as it goes along it just gets sillier. There is a grain of a good idea in it somewhere but it just goes through the well treaded path of being a poor imitation of horrors from the 70s and early 80s. There is nothing clever or inspired in this film at all. It is reasonably well made technically but really is laughable as a horror. My wife and I both just laughed out loud all the way through it because it was so silly and shook our heads at how it did all the usual cliched things . It was not remotely scary even once.In addition to various story faults it also had no sense of the period it was set in. Many things suggested it was set in the 70s or early 80s while other things betrayed that it was modern day. I could not tell what era it was intending to be portraying.The totally implausible turns of events and unbelievable choices made by characters in order to allow the rather childish plot to carry on down its predictable path was extremely disappointing. The best I can say about it was that it was not really badly acted like a lot of modern horrors, it was not really badly filmed as so many films are and it was kind of brainless fun. As an entertainment to pass the time with acceptable technical film-making I suppose it may be worthy of a teen sleepover watch with your friends for a laugh but nothing more sadly.Not the worst by any means as there are even more stupid horrors which are really poorly made and/or have inappropriate levels of torture porn or soft porn elements which I find really unpalatable but It Follows is only worth 3.5/10 for me."
" Don't understand the hype
",0.0,-0.9471,2018-03-16 00:00:00,3,"After seeing all the positive reviews and high ratings for 'It Follows' I started to doubt my perception or if indeed I'd watched the same film everybody else did. However, I've decided to stick with my original opinions and thoughts about this movie and thought it'd be interesting to share them since they differ from the general opinion presented in most reviews. I watched 'It Follows' shortly after it was added to Netflix UK and had no expectations, since Netflix's horror section is saturated with B-rated movies that are hardly worth watching. Whilst I understand the idea of a sexually transmitted entity is somewhat original and has never been done before (from my recollection), it's also ridiculous. It was presented as being a terrifying and serious thing, but I couldn't take it seriously and that immediately destroys any sense of fear or anxiety, which is important to feel when watching a horror film. Putting aside the idea of the entity itself, the plot was practically non-existent. The main female character contracts the entity at the beginning of the film and the rest of it is her feeling sorry for herself (she should try taking responsibility for her own actions - she's the one that had unprotected sex with a stranger) and expecting everyone else around her to fix her problems. What REALLY ticked me off and was the point where I completely wrote the film off is when she selfishly sleeps with her ""best friend"" a.k.a the sweet guy that lives across the street that's been crushing on her since they were kids, transmitting the entity to him and resulting in his death. Here's a question, WHO DOES THAT? How the hell is an audience supposed to root for a person that would do that? I can't understand what's so appealing about this film. Granted, I'm writing this review after having seen it some months ago, but I clearly remember the end credits rolling and thinking, ""Is that it?"" Having seen a lot of horror films, I'll be the first to hold my hands up and admit it takes A LOT to scare me, but this didn't have me on the edge of my seat even once. It's pretty hard to be afraid of some mysterious invisible entity that seems to move at a snails pace and that is so easily out-manoeuvred (the main girl seems to live with it successfully for long enough, as do the many people before her that manage to pass it on). Perhaps there may be some finer details such as the music or direction that was better, but none of it that was significant enough for me to remember it positively. My advice would be, if you decide to watch this movie DON'T go in with high expectations based on the reviews, because it's really not as good as that. For some odd reason people seem to have jumped on the bandwagon with this one and everyone sings its praises, when in reality it's no different than any other mediocre B-rated movie with poor acting, no story and zero creativity or intrigue."
" A pleasant, slow-moving watch
",0.5106,-0.8924,2018-03-08 00:00:00,8,"This is really, as I just mentioned in the title to this review, a very pleasant, slow-moving watch. The lovely cinematography elevates what could otherwise have been another silly teen-horror-type affair into a fairly immersive experience. In fact, I regularly found myself pleasantly puzzled by the effort which had been put into creating such a visually engaging film, when it really wouldn't necessarily be expected of it, given the subject matter. But, naturally, it is this emphasis on slowness and cinematography which really crafts the whole experience.I don't think it delves too far into the realm of spoilers to say that this is a 'nice' horror film. There is nothing emotionally wrenching. There is no torture porn... Nothing to make you particularly miserable. It just plods pleasantly along, not moving you too desperately as it goes... but in a good way. There are also no dumb jump scares. The nature of the villain is brooding, and that is how the film presents itself.Now... While the film does a great job of being absorbing and just sucking you in with its long takes and gently spiralling panoramas, it is not without its cinematic faults. There were two points in the movie where completely unnecessary (and appallingly bad) CGI abruptly took me out of the moment and reminded me that I was actually watching an unbelievable horror film. The use of godawful CGI for these two shots absolutely baffles me. I imagine you'll spot the bits I'm talking about. It looks like freakin' Birdemic and is completely out of character with the rest of the film. Just bizarre. Still... this was only a few seconds out of the movie.The cast seemed to me to do a fine job. No quibbles there.This movie, told as it is, feels very much like an allegory. A metaphor for the hopelessness of being young and directionless in a consuming spiral of tedium and urban decay.It's pretty great."

" Horror in the Detroit area, but maybe... love conquers all
",0.6652,-0.8749,2018-01-12 00:00:00,9,"RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, ""It Follows"" chronicles events in the Detroit area when a group of suburban youths have to contend with a strange curse spread through loose sex wherein the victim is followed by some THING, unless s/he passes the curse on to someone else.This movie shows what a talented filmmaker can do with only $2 million, a competent no-name cast and a brilliant composer (Rich Vreeland). In tone & quality the movie's akin to 2008's ""From Within,"" but more haunting and less talky, not to mention without the awkwardly overt commentary on Christian legalism vs. wicca. The film scores good marks in the female department with Bailey Spry (""Annie"" in the prologue), Maika Monroe (""Jay"") and Lili Sepe (""Kelly""); Olivia Luccardi too (""Yara"").COMMENTARY ON MAIN THEME (Don't read until you see the movie): The premise isn't juvenile at all, as some clueless critic suggested. In fact, it reflects real life as the potentially fatal curse for loose sex is akin to venereal disease, albeit spiritually rooted. It's the casual-sex-equals-death motif of slasher flicks but deeper. The ""monster"" in the movie represents the repercussions of meaningless sex, which may be physical, psychological or spiritual, but there is a price to pay. Two of the characters are childhood friends and their union is the antithesis of casual. Note the subtle yet potent climax. In addition, there are interesting subthemes to be gleaned, like the safe suburbs vs. the danger of the rundown inner city. THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 40 minutes and was shot in Detroit and the surrounding region (Sterling Heights, Berkley, Northville, Troy and Clawson,). GRADE: A"

" 10/10, no doubt about it.
",-0.5719,-0.8627,2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"If you, like me, look up ratings on IMDB to decide which films are worth watching, there's a chance you could miss this gem. There's a lot of people who apparently didn't like this movie. Let me tell you why: because It Follows is different from what people got used to when it comes to horror. It is a slow walk, not a rollercoaster ride filled with jumpscares at every turn. This film understands that horror isn't about that, it's about an idea, something that activates a primal instinct of survival deep within your brain. It Follows is about imagination, it is about what you don't see, what you don't know. So many horror movies make the mistake of trying to explain everything, where the monster comes from, what are his motivations, his abilities, etc. It Follows understands that there is value in mystery, that it makes things so much more interesting and terrifying. The film relies on the viewer's imagination to fill in the gaps, and it then either confirms his/her expectations or subverts it. Sadly, not many see it this way. Some think the film must give you all the answers, or tie up all the loose ends. It doesn't."
" Not so scary
",0.43,-0.909,2017-12-21 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie for the high rating, mainly as metascore.An horror movie MUST be scary, just like comedies MUST make you laugh. If they don't achieve this goal they failed. And ""It Follows"" failed. Acting and cinematography are OK, but the scary thing behaves in a horrorly correct way only when the ""monster"" transforms in Greg's mother and kills it.Otherwise the behavior of the 'creature' is not understandable. Why does it go on materializing itself so far from the victim, namely Jay, if it is so slow?I mean, I don't usually love paranormal horror movies, but once I have accepted the supernatural premise everything must be coherent, like in Carrie (1976).Anyway, all in all, it is quite amusing and I don't regret to have seen it"
" Overrated with really dumb characters
",-0.5563,-0.9567,2017-12-21 00:00:00,4,"I truly do not understand why this movie has such high marks. The film is quite annoying in a sense that we have extremely stupid and dumb characters. Why would you think you can electrocute or shoot a demon...a demon is clearly not alive and cannot be shocked or shot with a gun. I usually overlook logic in a movie, but that was just bad. Maika Monroe is a hit or miss actress. She did pretty well in this movie. She was definitely the stand out character. Everybody else was just bland or boring or just a bad actor/actress. And again, most of the characters are just plain dumb. Beyond horror movie dumb.The monster was cool. I'll admit that. A ""sexually transmitted"" demon. How often do you hear that?And I think that is why the movie got such high marks. However, one cool monster does not make up for a cast of bad decisions that could have easily been avoided. Overall, I'm going to have to give ""It Follows"" a 4/10."

IMO, this film just misses the list. ""It Follows"" is very good but has flaws. The story is very original. There is plenty of spooky activity, the film has parts that are frightening, and some good jump scares. On the other hand, the film moves slowly and contradicts itself, especially during the last 20 minutes or so. ""It Follows"" is a ""just miss"" but worth a try."

The direction is top class and it's a must watch for every horror movie fan. It will almost ruin you for expecting every horror movie to be like this , you ll start noticing the lack of great soundtracks in other horror movies , the character development , the mystery involving the main horror component. 9/10 just coz i dint want it to end and it did everything and had some great scary moments."

Also, what is the point of passing it on maybe they should change the name of the movie accordingly as pass it on? The film is urging you to have sex to skip the devil.

Its careful pace won't please some, but works well in suggesting menace beginning in a Michigan suburb strangely devoid of adults or apps, continuing to the deteriorated inner city and the ultimate climax (though not quite the one that got Jay, the central character, into her psychic mess). Despite showing sexual contact as having very unpleasant consequences, the film probably won't stop couples coupling in the back seat of a car."

It starts incredibly well, with a goosebump prologue, and keeps an high level of suspense and mystery until we get to the beach scene, and there, things start to get trashy and stupid. The movie switches abruptly from an excellent autorial horror thriller to a cheap B-movie with angry ghosts throwing televisions into pools... The concept was great, inventive and intriguing, but it was not developed in the same way. Music was good, directing was good, photography was very good, nothing to point out from a technical standpoint but, as I said, this isn't enough to save a confusing and embarrassing script that doesn't show up immediately, but leaves you time to think the movie is good before ruining it to you."
" One of the Finest Horror Movies of Recent Memory
",-0.5719,0.9895,2017-11-08 00:00:00,9,"Just like it's antagonist, It Follows moves along just slow enough to build the atmosphere, but just quick enough to keep it from feeling like a dirge to watch. We follow Jay who unwittingly takes the curse from a handsome peer she's dating. He kindly lays out the curse to her, and shows her the Follower so she knows what to expect, and then dumps her on her doorstep and disappears, leaving her to survive this ever-present threat to her well-being, while simultaneously getting her friends in on it to help her out.Crucially, the story knows not to reveal too much about anything. The Follower is never named, and the only things we know about it are what we're told by one of the characters, who is at best taking a good guess. This leaves a lot of wiggle room not just for the writer to shake it up a bit when required, but also for the audience to ponder long after the film has ended. What happens if you go overseas? What happens if the curse reverts back to someone who has already died? Can it climb? Can it swim? How much reasoning does it really have? And importantly, what would you do to shake it? The ambiguity is also present as the film starts to reach its climax. There's a couple of moments that are deliberately left open, and your interpretation of what happens between cuts affects how you view the movie's final act. For instance, Jay sees a group of three guys on a boat and swims out to meet them, but we cut before any implied sexual activity. Did she go through with it, or did she change her mind? Depending on which interpretation you take may lead you into different avenues with the film's ending.On this point the film has a lot to say, but what that is exactly is also open to interpretation. Horror movies are at their best when they have a metaphorical or satirical element. It Follows absolutely has some of these elements, even if they might not be that obvious. Even when viewed on a surface-level basis, It Follows is a strong film, but when you start to delve deeper and pick up on all these tiny little details, a new narrative starts to emerge. What does the Follower represent? Is it a sexually transmitted disease like HIV? Is it a metaphor for sexual maturity? Does it mark a loss of innocence and running away from responsibility? Does it try to say something about abuse, and how the abused often become the abuser? Is it an article on promiscuity? The fact that this movie can touch any and all these themes at the same time is a display of expert writing and attention to detail.Talking of detail, there's so much here once you start to scratch the surface. The use of colours, clothing, and the symbolism of water are all extremely important in picking up on the subtler themes. The Follower, in all of it's seen guises, appears in white, either in underwear, nightwear, or completely naked. No-one is seen in red until they've contracted the curse, and blue is a prominent marker for innocence. Water, also being blue, proves to be a big thing in the movie. It both precludes the Follower and marks as it's weakness. A number of scenes take place on the beach or by the shore, whether it's the girl's last stand at the beginning, or the last place Jay and Hugh go before doing the deed. The pool in the back garden is a comfort of simpler, more innocent times, while the pool that features as the stage for the climax hearkens back to Jay and Paul's first kiss when they were kids. The draining of the former and the colouring of red of the latter are sure to have some kind of deeper meaning behind them, depending on which subtext metaphor you like the sound of most.As if the writing and direction wasn't enough display of It Follows being a mastercraft, it has style out of the wazzoo. The cinematography is on overdrive, always aware of the angles it's creating and the frames it lives in. It focuses on the foreground while making an effort not to obscure the background and whatever may be lurking back there. Attaching the camera to the foot of a wheelchair so that it shakes and shudders as the chair does is disorientating, and a full circular rotation around a high school hallway reveals new details with each pass. Even when the cinematography isn't being obviously clever, it composes each scene in such a way that is oddly pleasing to the eye, while also maintaining it's dreamlike surreality that builds the atmosphere. The combination of camera placement, lighting, and colour give the movie an aesthetic quality that's often worth framing.The music deserves mention as well. Composed by Disasterpeace, it has a very John Carpenter feel to it, while also not feeling dated. It's not full-on 80s synthwave, but it errs pretty closely. Themes weave in and out and prove to be such an important ingredient to the film's atmosphere. Like any good score, it highlights moments and builds suspense, but without feeling cheap. It's melancholic and disturbing in equal measure. Just listening to it while sat alone writing this review made me feel unsettled, like something was going to creep up on me, and yet I enjoyed the music separately so much that I put it on repeat.It Follows is absolutely one of the finest horror movies in recent memory. It picks atmosphere over cheap scares, it's expertly written with a mind for themes and ambiguity, it's beautiful to look at and entertaining to listen to. It doesn't pick substance over style, but keeps both to the benefit of each other. Fantastic movie, would recommend, will watch again. 9/10."

",-0.296,0.1269,2017-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Is it too early to say there is a renaissance of horror movies going on? One thing is for sure: in the last few years we've experienced more than a few smart, well-made spookies coming from the US. And it's such a big relief to see that, apparently, the sh*t-show of endless jump-scares seems to be kind of over. So, alongside the fairly good ""The Conjuring"" and the fairly great ""The Babadook"", we can now add to the list of good American contemporary horror ""It Follows"": as the previous two, in fact, it shows what a good script, creative directing and pretty solid performances can do to the genre. Starting from the script, it has a beautiful simplicity to it: there's a non specified entity that follows the cursed and if ""it"" gets to them, it kills them; only way to get out of it is to pass the curse on to someone else through sexual intercourse. Alongside this thin but solid premise, Mitchell showcases simple, credible dialog and well-rounded characters. The chosen stage for the story is the declined city of Detroit: another spectral aspect that perfectly fits with the ghostly presence of the title. Sure, the group of teens that form the core characters of the movie are nothing short of the classic stereotyped nerds, jocks and so on, but they are enriched with a sort of ambiguity and uncertainty in their actions that's almost never seen in this genre. It's also noticeable how Mitchell leaves some important moments in the narrative out of the viewer's reach, with underlying meanings. It is not easy to work as an artist and not as an exploiter of mindless teenagers looking for a thrill in the horror industry, but Mitchell and his team worked out an unflinching film, that doesn't care to be too innovative, and yet modernizes classic '80s style creeps. It (see what I did there?) may not appeal to more gore or shock oriented moviegoers, but it's their loss. And it is because ""It Follows"" is the smartest horror in years.8/10"
" Outstanding Horror Elements, Good Acting, Great Direction and Writing
",0.8074,-0.9764,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"""It Follows"" is definitely one of the better horror movies released in the last five years. It uses genuine elements to create an atmosphere of horror, as compared to the routine and clichéd jump-scares. The plot revolves around a nineteen year old girl, Jay (M. Monroe) who gets haunted by an evil being after she has sex with a boy in his car. After their tryst, the boy reveals to her that he passed on a curse when they had intercourse ; now Jay must pass on the curse to someone else by having sex. If she doesn't, the evil spirit will kill her, and then come back to haunt the boy again. Jay teams up with her sister and friends to fight and defeat the evil spirit. Will they succeed in outwitting the evil being ?The direction and story-writing are excellent. The director has breathed new life into the horror genre. He has used mostly young actors and churned out brilliant performances from them. He has used the camera (s) quite cleverly also. The soundtrack / music of ""It Follows"" is outstanding. The musical element elevates the horror to the highest level.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because intriguing stories develop in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth !!).

" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,-0.9635,2017-11-03 00:00:00,4,"We begin this with the sight of a pretty teenage girl in her shorts and underwear and high-heels, running away from something only she can see. Instant alarm bells ring with the probability that this will be just another glitzy, ditzy, horror-lite involving vacuous catwalk lovelies being stalked by a nasty man in a mask.There are a lot more teens-in-shorts before it becomes apparent this isn't quite the shallow candy-floss I was dreading. This comes about with the courtship of blond Jay Height (Maika Monroe) and Hugh (Jake Weary), admirably waiting until their second date before having sex, during which Hugh passes on his 'affliction'. A similar passing on of the curse occurs with Greg (Daniel Zovatto), the next in line to have sex with Jay.This seems to be a movie for teens by teens, where mundane anarchy runs moderate in a world where parents probably exist but are never there. Reminiscing about where they had their first kiss/beer in tiny, scratchy lost little voices alternating with scenes where they fall into lightweight sex seems like juvenile sensationalism to me. When the apparitions appear, there are moments of tension accompanied by an enigmatic 'retro' musical score by a collective called Disasterpiece. The finale has echoes of the Japanese 'Ringu 2 (1999)' in its setting.Finally Jay gets to have sex with Paul (Keir Gilchrist), which may or may not pass on the curse. The very concept of a vague threat passed on by half-dressed young people coupling has a crassness that stops this film breaking out of its self-imposed 'teen fodder' stable of titillation, despite the interesting and well executed sense of occasional threat."

Right off the bat I found the premise really stupid and it never really takes off from there. The acting was like what you would expect from amateurs trying their best, not The Room-level of awful but not very good either.It would seem that people who gave this a full or near full score must live in some strange parallel universe where horse manure taste like chocolate pudding. That is seriously the ONLY thing I find eerie about this movie - the near psychotic levels of hype.I'm 43 years old. I love psychological horror. The Shining is my favorite horror movie of all time. This... I don't even know how to describe it. It just lacks everything that makes a great movie."

",0.0,-0.6926,2017-10-31 00:00:00,7,"It Follows is a slow burner, lots of build up and all the horror is based almost strictly off tension. The slow, methodical drive of the antagonist is eerily terrifying.My criticisms of the film include the acting. While its not terrible it could have been a lot better. The main actress Maika Monroe did very well but the rest of the cast is rather lacking. I also thought the ""leaving the suburbs"" scene was a rather odd inclusion. It was very preachy and just felt entirely out of place next to the rest of the film. It kind of took me out of it a bit moving forward.What I did love was the anachronistic feel of this, almost as if the viewer is watching someone's dream. This, coupled with a score very reminiscent of John Carpenter, fitted perfectly with the ambiance of the film, makes this a very refreshing horror movie.One question I have is what exactly is the message of this movie? ""Don't have casual sex or it could lead to your demise?"" I suppose it is a warning against STDs and advising safe sex but its not exactly clear what we're meant to learn.The throwbacks and homages of this horror film reminded me a lot of The Guest (also of 2014 and also starring Maika Monroe). We need more horror movies of this tone moving forward. I'm excited to see where this director goes next."

" Pretty bad
",-0.0772,-0.8978,2017-10-31 00:00:00,4,"""It Follows"" its one of those modern pretentious ""artsy horror"" films, horror movies that attempt to bring something new to the horror genre by trying to be serious and meaningful but end up falling flat every time.This is horror for teenagers, something hipsters enjoy because it pays ""homenage"" to ""old"" horror films and references literature from time to time to make up for the fart jokes, the dull yet awkward characters (this is probably why so many teens identify with them) and the total lack of suspense. Who would think that a person walking slowly could be scary? the filmmakers certainly thought so, they even added ""creepy"" horror music and sounds, even the usual ""scary face"" from many mediocre horror films makes an appearance.This one has a cult following, the people who like it are probably the kind of people who are nostalgic for ""retro horror"" and like the slow as hell scenes and the deadpan delivery from these actors. Its OK for people to like these kind of films, I have nothing against people liking stuff, its just not my cup of tea. I just want something honest, I watched Exorcist II: The Heretic for this October and I enjoyed that way more than this, even when it almost became a comedy because of how weird and crazy it was but that movie rejoiced in its absurdity to the point when it became an experience, when It Follows its absurd, its just dumb.The rules for the ""monster"" sound really forced, it like they were trying to make the rules for what they thought would be a new classic but ended up with an unbelievable mess. It has some good aspects, the music its pretty good, it deserves a better film. The cinematography was good too, it was ""independent artsy"" kind of good and there's not one memorable shot in the whole thing but still. The symbolism is so obvious it becomes meaningless, the characters are all unlikeable and its astonishingly boring."
" A Horror Film Classic...Ten Out of Ten
",-0.5719,0.7402,2017-10-29 00:00:00,10,"A perfect horror movie to watch around Halloween time is ""It Follows"", a story about a group of high school students trying to protect their friend Jay Height (Maika Monroe) who has unwittingly become the last link in a chain of sexual partners thus making her the sole prey of an unknown supernatural predator only she can see. It can look like a young woman wearing a torn blouse and dripping urine from beneath her skirt, a naked man standing on the roof of her own home, or a tall man who could easily pass for ""Lurch"", the awkward butler from ""The Addams Family"" TV sitcom. And the only way for her to survive is by having sex with someone else to pass along the curse.Jay has sex for the first time with her new boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) and everything is going great until he forces her to realize that she is now the lowest member of a human food chain strung together through sexual encounters and warns her to run away from any stranger who is walking directly at her. His nightmarish tale comes true a few days later when Jay glances out the window of her classroom and sees an old woman wearing a hospital gown walking across the lawn headed in her direction. She escapes this first encounter and runs home to seek help from her sister Kelly (Lily Sepe), her childhood neighbour Paul (Keir Gilchrist), and another close friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi) who circle the wagons around her. Later, a mutual high school acquaintance Greg (Daniel Zovatto) follows them into the park and drives them out of the city for safety.""It Follows"" has everything horror movie fans enjoy; a twisted story line, resilient survivors, smooth flowing dialogue, and genuine cinematic appeal. This supernatural curse has been passed along quietly from one sexual partner to the next without alarming anyone else in the small town. Jay and her high school friends are mature enough to hang onto their low paying jobs yet still enjoy a carefree day at the beach. They can talk to each other without resorting to slang or trash talk yet each can poke fun at the others with a pretty sharp needle. The empty high school hallway Jay runs through and the deserted beach where Yara splashes around in the water as the others hang back on the sand are perfect settings for the attacks that follow.This movie packs a real psychological wallop without resorting to a lot of screaming or hysteria. Yara is left behind to nurse her gun shot wound while Paul and Kelly methodically go around the indoor swimming pool deck following Jay's finger points trying to kill a creature they cannot see. Yet the gruesome body of the first teenage victim and Greg's disturbing death scene are enough to satisfy the most sophisticated horror genre fan.There is no explanation for the low rating given by the IMDb's user reviews except perhaps poor word of mouth at the box office because ""It Follows"" stands alongside two other great movies, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Shinning"" as a classic horror film. This movie deserves ten out of ten."
" A Public Service Announcement
",0.0,-0.8026,2017-10-27 00:00:00,6,"""It Follows"" is a a low budget yet decent film about a being/entity/presence that quite literally follows its victim. A young woman gets intimate with a guy only to have him violently tell her, ""tag, you're it"", in a sense. Maybe he didn't say those exact words, but he essentially told her that now he has freed himself and that she will be followed by some unknown malevolent life force and it will continue to follow her until it has killed her. That is, unless she can find someone else to pass it on to.The movie then takes us through some tense moments with a few jump scares. The story line is OK as well as the acting.What I can't figure out though is: is this movie a public service announcement for abstinence or for sleeping with as many people as you can?

It's almost as if some of these people just want to say something negative just because they have the opportunity to do so. I guess this gem of a movie isn't for everyone. Not everyone appreciates caviar and champagne either right ? If you're the type of person who's typically mainstream in their tastes, and you love everything from McDonalds to big budget blockbuster crappy movies like The Mummy with Tom Cruise, than this may not be for you.

Production values are a bit cheap, but, if anything, that helps the movie, giving it an authentic, gritty feel. Also means the director has to rely on plot, improvisation and getting the most out of his cast, rather than throwing large amounts of money mindlessly at special effects, which is a very good thing.The cast are all unknowns and put in solid performances.

The atmosphere of dark suspense is built up quite well many times, scary jumps are good, too.

Maika Monroe is a sweet lady, but she often lacks certain depth and way too often is just staring blankly again leading to a loss of a real thrill or scare.

The film is so dull, nothing exciting, nothing the scary. The minor jumps which are in this film are predictable & unoriginal. The story itself is so clichéd - have young sex & you'll be punished. I've lost track of the amount of films which seem to work along the lines of ""if you're young, promiscuous & attractive - you will die"" Also, please don't get me started on its soundtrack - I found it more distracting that suspense creating.

Unbeknownst to Jay, Hugh was being relentlessly stalked by a deadly and persistent carnal supernatural force that's now after her.Writer/director David Robert Mitchell relates the inspired and absorbing story at a hypnotically gradual pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a believably mundane everyday reality, ably crafts a potently unsettling sense of pure flesh-crawling dread and unease, and offers an original otherworldly demon which could very well represent a fatal sexually transmitted disease ala AIDS, the deep-seated fear and inevitability of death, and even the feelings of guilt and shame that the puritanical American culture ascribes to people engaging in intercourse for pleasurable purposes. Moreover, this film's strangely timeless quality adds immensely to its overall eerie and unnerving atmosphere while the fact that the demonic force moves slow, but never gives up and seems unstoppable ensures that this picture is guaranteed to really get under your skin. In addition, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Lili Sepe as Jay's concerned sister Kelly, Daniel Zovatto as the decent Greg Hannigan, Keir Gilchrist as smitten nerd Paul, and Olivia Luccardi as the gawky Yara. The crisp cinematography by Mike Gioulakis makes masterful use of the widescreen format. Rich Vreeland's shivery synthesizer score hits the pulsating shuddery spot.

" Fresh, original concept for a horror movie
",-0.0258,0.9914,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"It Follows is an original concept compiled into what can only be explained as an artistic horror film. It was released in 2014 but has gained some traction over the past few years and landed on many ""must watch horror"" lists. The concept is that ""it"" will follow whoever the carrier is, which is passed on through sex to a new carrier. Not the kind of STD that your doctor is going to write you a script of penicillin to clear up. So, buckle up and let's do a spoiler free review of It Follows.The Good: The first thing you're probably going to ask yourself while watching this movie is what time frame this is set in. The style of clothing could match the modern-day hipster or young adults that are fashion savvy. The settings and most of the technology or lack thereof (other than some weird shell e-reader thing) could also lean towards being late 70s/early 80s. It makes for an interesting approach to the overall atmosphere and according to the director David Robert Mitchell, it's intentionally filmed this way to create a dream effect (AV Club). It's a very cool spin to what is already an interesting concept for a movie.The build of suspension in this movie is phenomenal. The score is constantly building tension, as Jay (Maika Monroe) is eluding her stalking demon. The beauty of it is that half the time you never actually see the monster and when you do, it often looks very ordinary. Yet the director still manages to build a sense of dread without going in the direction of making it hokey. Like horror of old, the director created a slow, steady and unrelenting monster which will constantly keep you on edge. They could have very easily gone with an over-the- top CGI monster but I'm certainly glad they went with a far subtler approach. This movie will make you think twice about anyone slowly walking in your direction.This film is also paced very well. It Follows wastes no time in introducing you for what's to come and manages to stay consistent for the entire film. The director manages to make an almost two hour film feel like an hour. Jay and her friends are quick to start coming up with some ideas on how to evade the creature and buy some time to really assess the situation. I love when characters in horror movies play it smart by developing and executing plans that don't suck. Whether they're all successful or not is a totally different story.The Bad: Now that I went on my whole rant about great plans and execution, I have to add a caveat and say that they also had some really dumb ideas and lack of trying other approaches. I understand horror and most stories in general, at their core rely on characters failing to execute plans. I would for once like to see a horror movie try all rational approaches that a real person would try just so that the audience would feel like there truly are no other options. Throughout the film I was coming up with all sorts of different ways that I'd deal with this and I was a bit disappointed that the scope of their creativity was so limited.Some of the characters seemed either totally unnecessary or became annoying in their persistence that the monster wasn't real. Personally, if I saw a door get blown in half, I'd probably start believing the girl that's freaking out about an invisible creature stalking her. Yara (played by Olivia Luccardi) is by far the most unnecessary character as she basically has no lines other than ""What's wrong?!"" whenever the creature approaches and Jay starts freaking out. Dude, you know what's wrong, stop asking.The Judgment: The flaws of this movie are minor and easily overlooked because of the great concept and storytelling of the film. I believe that this was a solid mark on the new age of horror films and showed that it's not dead yet. David Robert Mitchell managed to bring back the spirit of old horror and give it a fresh spin. I'll definitely be looking out for a sequel to this movie that may hopefully visit the origins of the demon or conclude the story in a more permanent way. I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for a solid, original horror.Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com"
" A very refreshing horror film!
",-0.6452,0.5794,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,I have become tired of all the immature horror films out there that completely relies on jump-scares. When you see a cast of teenagers you would expect bad acting and clichéd screenplay but this wasn't the case for this film. Though there isn't much of a complex story but the movie is well written and the actors did a brilliant job(unlike most horror and slasher film where teenagers are killed once after another). The pacing of the movie is brilliant. This isn't a perfect movie but it has it's own merits and deserves much respect. Watch this movie with low expectation then you'll be pleasantly surprised.
" Not worth it.
",-0.1695,-0.9649,2017-09-15 00:00:00,4,"Now, I don't mind movies that don't make any apparent sense. In fact, I can appreciate some of them when they are, for example, paired with a quirky humour, deep wisdom, or absolute horror. In short, if there is something about it that makes it worthwhile.Not so the teen-horror ""it follows"". We're never really told what it actually is, that follows - some sort of STC (sexually transmitted curse), first cast by a witch scorned/horny and angry/pi**ed and hateful? Who knows. All we know is that it follows until you give it to someone else, and again if they happen to die. Up to a certain point, the movie wasn't too bad. That must have been the point where I started doubting there ever would be some sort of solution or explanation, and it starting to make no sense. Running away from your follower forever is hardly a solution. Transmitting the curse until it comes back to you isn't either. Following the example of other such movies about curses, the group of friends could have at least tried to figure out where it was really coming from. Insert some exciting amateur sleuth work, the usual frantic newspaper search in a marathon with time, a back-tracking of sexual partners or at the very least some detecting about ""mysterious death cases"" after ""running from an invisible threat"". Anything? Really?No. Instead, they come up with some sort of mysterious ""plan"", isolate themselves in an abandoned pool, put the girl inside for bait while decorating the edge with plugged-in electrical appliances. Why? Are you guys intending to fry the thing? We've never seen it in water, while we have indeed seen it wet. When Jamie points to the invisible threat and tells her friends how it is indeed not getting in the water (while always walking an accurate zip-line to its victim, right?) we may begin to form the theory it truly abhors water. If that were the case, why not camp out on an island somewhere? No, instead you put the victim in a pool ready to be electrocuted. ""If I'm gonna die I'm gonna take a few with me?"" You think the thing is going to die if the victim dies voluntarily? Or was the plan to electrocute it? Shooting it didn't work. Not sure why electrocution should. (There's other nonsense like ""You're going to die if it touches you!"", yet it touched Jamie about twice - the immediate effect was painful marks, not death.)Well, while the follower seems reluctant to get in the water, instead throws things at Jamie, the friends try to shoot it, until it ends up in the water.But then, as they finally have Jamie out of the water... why did they never follow through with the electrocution plan? All they do is huddle around her and yell hysterically about the invisible's whereabouts. Which still is the water. As it mysteriously disappeared in a cloud of blood. Soooo it is allergic to water after all? Is it ""dead""? The end of the movie, with Jamie having sex with her friend, and her friend driving through a red light district, suggests otherwise. Either way, they did nothing really to stand up against it, and nothing is explained, with neither smart dialogue or ancient wisdom woven into the story.Left me about as satisfied as Jamie, each time she was part of a transmission.

",0.4585,0.9822,2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"8/10 Horror Movie (Gone WRONG) (Gone SEXUAL). While these clickbaity titles can be applied to almost every horror movie, good or bad. ""It Follows"" not only manages to subvert these tropes, not with excluding them, but giving them the main focus. Has a parody of anything being more serious and competent that the material that is being parodied? Not until this production happened. It tells the story of a teenage girl that is hunted by a mysterious slow-walking entity after a sexual encounter. The rules that this ""entity"" follows are intentionally ridiculous, with the goal to make fun of other horror clichés.But is the film funny? Not even a little bit, actually quite the opposite. The sex scenes that usually would make the teens who sneaked into the theatre gasp hormonally, are disturbing and violent. 80s vibe follows throughout with the splendid use of old techno music, despite the day and age being unknown. The cast does a stellar job conveying the horror of the STD curse, with Maika Monroe looking too much like a blonde Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Keil Gilchrist plays the awkward friend crushing on the Prom Queen with a pleasant twist, involving a great character arc. The other kids are disposable horror movies characters, without being annoying.My main gripe is how illogical these characters act in certain situations and it even seems like the director acknowledges it.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous for the pocket-sized budget. The pacing was perfect and I felt involved almost the whole time. Twisting the idea of biological reproducing is a really haunting idea, as well as the multiple themes of growing-up. The climax has brought a lot of controversy, but oh well, I loved it.Conclusion: Overall It Follows has a lot of great concepts and themes going on and the majority of them is executed successfully and few of them poorly. If you expect standard Hollywood-is jump scares you will probably be disappointed, but if you seek a unique horror movie with a compelling message you should definitely check it out."
" Not the type of horror you'd expect.
",-0.5719,-0.0997,2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,"This film doesn't follow the same format as the typical horror films we have today that solely aims for cheap jump scares.After watching this you will be left mostly unsettled and paranoid as you feel like you have to check that aren't being followed by the evil entity that exists in the movie. The film has a pacing and acting that's closer to real life. It's not filmed in a way to make you feel like you're just the audience, it makes you feel like a bystander. That way after you've watched the film it doesn't feel like ""ok that was a movie now I'll go back to real life"". It feels like you've participated in the events that took place and now you have to watch out for yourself. I'm giving this a 7/10 because they're probably the only ones thinking out of the box when it comes to this genre."

",0.7814,0.8581,2017-08-31 00:00:00,6,"Everyone has praised this film's premise and execution and I will say that I found it creepy until I started thinking about it. If it could look like anything, why would it look like an old lady or a brutal rape victim or a giant man? You know, the most obvious things it could possibly be? Still, it was unique and well made so I was willing to overlook that... until it got to the beach scene. How anyone made it through this scene without laughing is beyond me.So the characters decide to run to a beach house and just hang out there waiting for it to arrive. When it finally does, it walks up behind the main character and... strangles her? No. Breaks her neck? No... it gently lifts her hair up... that is to say her hair magically rises into the air by itself. The other guy notices and tries to help her but gets punted right off the screen by nothing. It was seriously hilarious.But nothing topped the climax where it shows up looking like bearded Henry Cavill's Superman and their plan is to push it into a pool and throw toasters in to electrocute it. But instead, it just starts throwing the toasters at the people. Then one of the kids shoots one of the other kids and it was the funniest thing ever.I'd still recommend seeing it for its uniqueness, but seriously... HOW did anyone find this movie scary after that?"

The pace is kept slow to build in the creepiness of the scenario, but it starts irritating when nothing new happens. Also, the acting is quite average. The direction is OK but it's not supported enough by the screenplay. Overall, a forgetful film."

The problem is this another case of a movie with a lot of potential, originality but is let down by poor directing and overall direction of where the movie is going.

I don't know when this was supposed to be set but it seemed all over the place with old tube tvs but modern cars littered throughout as an example. The plot (for want of a better word) is thin at best. You have sex, something that changes shape follows you slooooowly, you die. Unless you have sex with someone else. Then it goes after them instead. If it kills them it comes back after you so be prepared to screw around as much as possible. The parents have little to no roll in this film and don't care what their kids are up to. There is no explanation of what this thing is, where it came from or why it's doing what it does slooooowly. Even an ambiguous ending that is abrupt at best. Is it gone or isn't it? The kindest thing I can say about the acting is nothing at all. Please, for the love of everything evil, don't make a sequel!"

" Calling it a horror movie is just not right.
",-0.5719,0.947,2017-08-26 00:00:00,1,"If I could give this movie less than one star, I would. Let's start with the fact that all through the movie the entity that follows them which is what the movie is about is not even clarified at all. There is no back story given at any point of the movie. Even though the actors were pretty good, the scenes kept jumping from one scenery to the other without any possible explanations! It felt like someone cut up the movie into parts and forgot to add in the transitions. In the beginning of the movie something happens and then by the end of the movie they do not bring it back nor explain why it happened or even how.Completely unrelated bits and pieces. This movie did not scare me at all and did not even have a good story line. It was like an amateur (and not a good one) decided to write up a story before going to bed and then they decided to make it into a movie. I have no idea how it has good reviews and I honestly believe it is a waste of time to even consider it."
" Not scary
",0.3875,0.5943,2017-08-25 00:00:00,4,Disappointed. For me as a true horror film lover this film wasn't scary at all. Everything was really predictable. Nothing special. These days loads of good horrors comes out and this one can't beat them. I don't think this film is worth your attention. For a person who seen at least 3 horror films it won't be scary or exciting. Do not recommend. But the actors are good tho.
" What the hell did I just watch...?!?!?
",-0.7733,-0.8687,2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,This film had so much potential started off well and then lost plot literally. There's no back story no explanation as to why it happens.. the ending was sh*t and made no sense. at least give some information... why wasn't the guy at the end affected? Very disappointed I dunno what else was watching rating it so high.
" Good story, poor screenplay
",-0.0516,-0.8971,2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"This film is a good thriller, but I think it is a bit overrated, in particular considering critics. Surely it's above the average of the modern thriller and horror films. It has a cool story, creepy atmospheres (the idea of setting it in Detroit suburbs is great!) and a disturbing soundtrack. What really misses is the script: it seems everything happens and happens, repetitive, but in the end nothing really happens. There are some incongruities, too. I don't want to discuss the meaning of the whole film (the director said he had got the idea of the story from a recurring nightmare he used to have), if it's a condemn to certain sexual habits or whatever. Maybe we can find a denounce to parents who ""abandon"" their kids to themselves.As an horror fan, I recognize the effort made to propose a fresh product, with the right direction and atmosphere.But, all in all, something misses, that flair that could have made it more terrific and unforgettable."
" ridiculous but good
",0.4767,0.7127,2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie seems serious and also contains silly contents, but a chain of fear makes it enjoyable. It's common for horror movies to have endless issues or not to have any solutions to end it. This movie is like this, too. Some grotesque scenes and the last scene in the water cause us much more scares. I especially like the unique camera work which also makes us feel terrified. Although it has some ridiculous settings or some blemish points in it, the unrealistic story and the ghost walking slowly make us creep all over. I don't recommend anyone who is square to watch it because it emphasizes something sexual, so you'll never be able to enjoy it unless you can laugh sexual things off as a joke. I really want to watch it again with my funny friends."
" OK for a slow moving psychological horror story
",-0.1943,-0.8478,2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of psychological horror movies because they move a little too slow for me. IT FOLLOWS is not a splatter/gore horror movie - it is a psychological one which means that there is more of a dread feeling throughout than outright horror. The film concerns a woman who contracts a supernatural entity through having sex. The entity will follow her and try to kill her unless she passes it on to someone else who can live long enough to pass it on further.I know that there are reviewers who have given this movie a 10 - I can't due to all of the plot holes and contradictions (and I wouldn't even if that was all tied up). Let's just say that there are a lot of things left unexplained or that didn't make sense after it was all said and done. For example, there was never an explanation for the origin of the entity or what happens if you are involved with multiple people.The acting is okay, but I found certain parts hard to hear. As indicated, it also moves along at a tortoise pace, par for the course for this type of movie. It did keep me kinda interested which is more than I can say for a lot of movies in this type of genre. The soundtrack was also quite effective in building up that feeling of dread.There might be some folks who are a little put off by the underlying abstinence message - I knew what the movie was about before I watched it so I knew what to expect as far as that was concerned. It is such a common theme that it is almost anticipated in any horror film that involves high school/college folks. This one is no exception.So, the bottom line is that if you can get past the plot holes and contradictions, it is a pretty good psychological horror movie. If you are looking for a blood fest and/or a lot of jump scares you will definitely need to skip it - it will bore you to tears. For me, it was just okay."
" Fantastic genre film- even as not a fan of horror.
",0.6844,0.9413,2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"This film never lets you off your toes.A very great premise in a world of supernatural garbage at every turn. However, with ""It Follows"", the film presents a fear that affects the character every single second (and in doing that, the viewer as well.)Every aspect of this film works towards a goal, the goal being tone. The music, cinematography, editing, writing, and acting are all marvellously wrapped together into a flawless story. In every scene of the film, even when ""it"" is not seen, we still worry about the safety of the main character. This is a perfect example of great directing, creating a fear of something that isn't even there.The film achieves a frightening feeling throughout the entire runtime. Day, night, it doesn't matter. It follows you, until it gets you.Not only is this a great horror movie, it is a great film regardless."
" Atmospheric Horror / Thriller That Isn't Campy!
",-0.5562,0.8652,2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"It's a difficult task to find a horror or thriller horror that's not campy or just plain silliness. For example, I loved Silence of The Lambs. I couldn't stand the Jason or Freddy series (after age 14, st least!) This film is atmospheric, spooky, and just plain good. My boyfriend can't stand horror movies of any sort and he loved this. This is right up there with films like The Ring as far as the feeling you get while you're watching. This can only stem from excellent production and directing. The characters are well defined and well-acted; a few years older than typical high school grads and are living in a sort of alternate reality, waiting for their real lives to begin. They're in college and living at home, all friends who have grown up together in their Michigan neighborhood. There are also some messages in this film: be careful who you are intimate with!"
" See what it would be like if one of your greatest fears is realized...
",0.5994,-0.8836,2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"There are so many reviews here and a lot has already been said, but I'd like to focus on what I think is the core and root of the terror in this film. I can say for sure that the following situation has happened to almost everyone, especially in their childhood: Imagine you're all alone in the house, sitting on the couch. All of a sudden you get one of those paranoid frights that the combination of silence, idleness, and being alone bring. Your eyes turn to the half open door of a room, or to the top of the wooden stairs behind you. You feel a sudden chill. You can't look away. What if someone, or something, comes in through that door or down the stairs? What's it gonna be like? What's it gonna do to me? What will I do? Can I evade it and get out of the house? etc. The fear keeps chewing at your soul until someone finally arrives and you're off the hook. Would you like to see and feel what it would be like if such a thing could become an actual threat, something real, and much more terrifying than you could have imagined? That is something It Follows skillfully manages to pull off. It's a nightmarish ride, slow but captivating. It doesn't shock you with a sudden 200-volt electrical current, but it makes sure you're connected to a low-voltage one throughout the movie. Its against-the-grain approach to the concept of horror gets a hold on you, one that would probably stick with you long after you're done watching it. Sure, the premise might seem to be no different than a cliché horror flick; a girl infected by a demonic entity transmitted through sexual intercourse, the usual scenario where a couple of teenagers struggle with a curse and go searching for clues to figure out how to get rid of it. It Follows, however, is much more than that. It's like a tiny little bug that's placed on your palm. It appears harmless at first, but while you're unaware, it slowly crawls into your ear and your brain, infecting you with a bone-chilling thought. It's by no means perfect, of course. There are plot holes that might occur to you after you're done watching it, and at times the rhythm becomes annoyingly dull and slow. It's not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It does what it intends to do quite well, and frankly, with such a budget, it's more than acceptable. If you're into horror of the psychological kind, you will definitely get enjoyment out of this film. If it doesn't happen the first time you watch it, it will probably come to you once you give it serious thought or watch it a second time. Long story short, it's a genuine and admirable attempt at psychological horror, a la Babadook!"

" Old School Classic Thrills With Modern Day Jumps!
",0.4199,0.9885,2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why it has taken me until now to watch this movie, maybe after seeing it surface on Netflix recently, It has charm and stays true to horror without veering off course. I instantly wanted to watch it after seeing a trailer, and I take my horror movies quite seriously (Exorcist, Omen etc being classical and modern day scares being cheap and jumpy- Blair witch really being were it stopped with modern day spooks for me, anything after that era hasn't stuck in mind!) Once the first 10/20 minutes kicked in it was a captivating blend of aesthetics, modern day teenage drama, American neighborhood, kids taking medication, going to high school and on dates - nothing new there, it reminded me of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" all throughout the film, in particular in the acting among-st the kids and in elements of soundtrack. The Soundtrack was fantastic and really was part of the driving force of this film which seems to rely on suspense, drama and focusing on the story, old school techniques that the best horror movies used. The film looks very beautiful, it's dark and brooding, and has this really grainy type of feel to it. It seemed like I heard a tiny bits of the ""Halloween"" movie score throughout, which again- instantly made me think and associate this with old fashioned horror movies. Hearing that hammer horror type corny music when you know ""the monster is nearby"" still creates that hand over the eyes effect, even in me. I suppose people are so used to the narrative of the jump scare scenes of horror flicks today they can almost predict how it's going to go in real time. This was semi predictable but brought some fresh new things to the table. The main character Jay didn't really get a full introduction, or a back story, and I like that they just let her character be, and we go along with her mystique and calm nature. She reminded me of a more rough and tumble version of Hillary Duff, they also keep her respectable throughout the film were she spends a large portion of it half naked running around. When I got half way into the film something in my head said ""this is a little bit like a cheeky nod to STDs"" ,passing on to people maybe without them knowing who has it or what it looks like, it wasn't until I read the trivia afterwards that I made the connection so it was doing it's job right with the theme. I think I was sold from the part 20mins in where she was in class and staring out the window. Again, it was a little nod to the infamous Halloween scene, and I forgave it for being an overused scene now from other movies abusing it, but this movie took it a little more aggressive and creepy with having it as an old woman, out of place, walking straight towards her. The safety net dropping once you realize the other kids can't see her only the main character.It kept my attention pretty much 80% throughout the whole film, and for a recent horror flick, that is good going. Combining some jump scenes with realistic special effects alongside old school horror movie techniques it creates a perfect balance of old and new. There wasn't any obvious plot holes or moments when I thought ""I was going with it up until ..."" it all just ran smoothly, and passed the mark in my book. As for the ending I enjoyed it. It really wasn't going to turn out any other way in my mind other than something like that, and I think that that kind of ending has been used for centuries now, old and new, and it still works!"

Trust me, you would see a lot this time.The common themes of horror movies haven't changed for a long time. The new movies just shuffles the general pool with little to no original input. This movie is something new on its own. It was scary without the CGI or the jump scares or the dark alleyways. This by itself says a lot about this movies quality.The story is very good. The director did a good job giving life to the story. I liked how he ignored the common structure of horror movies. He could've easily followed the norm even with this story to scare people, but thankfully he didn't. The overall tone is calm and there is very little explanation of whats going on which always keeps the viewers in a state of soothing suspense, if that makes any sense. I also enjoyed the key characters not being plain stupid like the other horror movies.I have some issues with the pool scene. This might seem being too much skeptical but bullets don't travel very far under water. And another thing bugged me. Why didn't they just slept with a prostitute and passed it on. The chance of this curse moving down a big chain of people is very high in that case.Overall this was a good movie. One shouldn't simply just skip the chance of watching this."

" Underrated gem of the Horror Genre
",-0.5719,-0.9161,2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"It Follows is one of those horror movies that really stick out for me. It's tense and scary like any horror should be but what I really like about this movie is the subtly. The idea itself leaves me incredibly paranoid and anxious. I see someone in the background of this movie and wonder if it's the thing hell bent on finding the main character. The symbolism of things like the colour red showing up when 'it' is around is really interesting and awesome. I like the theme of loss of innocence and young adults finding their purpose although I can maybe see why some might read it as some sort of 'anti-sex' message. I personally just see it as a coming of age story. 'It' can be seen as many things from the impending loss of youth or the fact that no matter what, we all die. Death always follows. Or you could view it as a STI; it's really open for interpretation which I love. This movie also does a lot of cool call backs to classic horror stuff like the amazing soundtrack by Disasterpeace. There's even little jack-o-lanterns on someone's porch as a homage to the movie Halloween. This movie scared and intrigued me and it's a shame that this type of movie gets such low scores."

It has followed me for years and I can't stop thinking about it. Give it a try, you don't have much to lose."

Is this a horror movie or a 90-minute PSA for abstinence? However you interpret it, it's a brilliantly filmed and edited throwback to the early 80's, VCR horror genre. It Follows deserves a spot in the naughty isle of the Blockbuster in your mind. It captures that same unintentionally funny aspects of 80's slasher flicks. The soundtrack is quite reminiscent of Goblin. Also, for a film of such very little budget, the cinematography is world's ahead of any recent horror film of the mainstream."
" Original but not excellent
",-0.5183,-0.9853,2017-07-10 00:00:00,7,"I think the whole idea seems just perfect. A different kind of horror, or maybe not a different one but a style forgotten in the midst of all the typical demonic/exorcism dull movies of nowadays. However, the poor acting -for those who really care about that- distracts you from the suspense of the scenes. ""It Follows"", scares you not because of monsters, possessed nuns, or creepy dolls, but because mixes up the fear of casual sexual encounters and paranormal activity. Main Character Jay, for me, was a typical dumb horror movie main character. She does the exact things Jeff tells her not to do, Every time. She's just too stupid. But that's how horror movies work sometimes.The last 10 minutes of the movie I wondered how the producers would finish all the mysteries around ""It"" in just a couple of minutes, but at the end I found out that was never in their plans. So, you just finish the movie knowing pretty much nothing. You never know how it all started, and personally never understood how Jeff discovered he could pass it through sexual intercourse, if, after all, he got it through a one night stand with an anonymous chick."

Certainly not perfect, as most horror movies aren't. It is original, and engaging though. This movie isn't as scary, as it is disturbing. I mean a thing follows you constantly, and won't stop until you pass it on, truly an original movie. It is a relatively easy watch, and recommend it for a rainy night. Again some plot holes, but overall a good movie start to finish."
" It follows is a horrible movie (some spoilers)

I was interested when I started watching the movie and it was creepy at first, but that changed about halfway in.First of all, the being that follows the main character eventually loses its scare value. It just follows you... that's it. Sure it can kill anyone it follows, but is walks so slowly that it kind of becomes ridiculous after a while.Second, the characters react like absolute morons most of the time. The being is passed on by having sex with another person and the main character is accompanied by two men most of the time. All these guys want to do is to have sex with the main character. Supposedly they want to ""help her"" to get rid of the being, but in the end they just come across like horny guys looking for an excuse to have sex.This movie irritated me so much towards the end because the stupidity of the characters just increased as the movie went on. They didn't react realistically in any way. Terrible movie."

Some mysterious entity that will always come after you unless you pass it on to others. And the entity can take the form of people you know. The fact that you don't really know what this entity is, really adds to the horror in my opinion. The unknown is the most scary to me.Ambiguity is a big theme in this movie, which is interesting in and of it self. It's never clear what the time period is. Elements of several different decades are all mixed together.The problem with this movie however, is the writer doesn't know what to do with the premise. The protagonists start out using trial and error methods to avoid and defeat ""it."" Running away, then shooting it. But then, after finding out that attacking it physically doesn't work, they keep trying to attack it physically again, even though that method was already shown to not work. That's the climax of this movie. The protagonists trying to do something that was already proved to not work. And it obviously fails, as was previously established earlier in the film."
" ""It Follows"" is a unnerving throw back to the horror classics of the 1970s and 1980s.
",-0.5719,0.9505,2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"""It Follows"" manages to break away from the majority of unappealing mainstream horror films with a throw back to the classics of the 1970s and 1980s. The film can be seen to draw influence from John Carpenter's Halloween of a high school girl being stalked by a mysterious figure. But make no mistake ""It Follows"" is able to create a truly unique experience, with a combination of Disaterpeace's brilliant musical score and Mike Gioulakis's slow creeping cinematography seeming to simulate a stalker in itself creating an entirely unnerving atmosphere. While the all-round acting in the film is good Makia Monroe's leading performance is a definite standout portraying brilliantly a character fearing for her life at every turn. However, this film is not perfect as it begins to drag towards the mid-point of the film and leaves several questions unanswered. Yet the slower pace towards the middle may be down to director David Robert Mitchell making the film replicate the slow moving nature of the entity itself. Also the fact that some things are left unanswered is also able to add to the mystery around the creature in general. Overall ""It Follows"" is a brilliant horror film that blends great cinematography, music, acting, and directing to create a very effective and unnerving throw back to the horror cinema of the 1970s and 1980s."
" Another disposable film that had really great marketing.
",0.659,0.7717,2017-07-02 00:00:00,4,"So I finally got around to watching It Follows, which was released in theatres a couple of years ago. It wasn't a film I was highly anticipating, if at all. It seemed mildly interesting. I suppose I almost got sucked into that way of thinking that it appears to be a different kind of horror film of today, and it kind of is, and although I appreciate a unique story, what it really comes down to is that it's just silly.Now don't get me wrong, it is pretty high up on creating an atmosphere and it is creepy. Basically, sex is the theme of the story and the consequences that follow. A person will soon be followed bydead people, ghosts who will murder their target. Hmmm Well, the first half is definitely better than the second half because it plays out as more psychological. Could it really be all in the mind of the protagonist? I think that is the strength of this film. Also, I must point out that the cinematography helps achieve its effectiveness; engaging, cool camera-work. Now getting around to the second half of the movie, I wanted one of the side characters to say something like, ""If this thing that's following you isn't real, then there's no reason to be threatened by it, right?"" It never happens. It seems that Jay, the central character, was the only one who could see who is coming after her even when her friends were right by her side. Another question is, in what ways could an unseen force kill someone? Where I'm getting at is I like the psychological aspect of it, unfortunately, however, that isn't the whole film.The film goes by mostly at a steady pace. Then I checked at the 1 hour and 15-minute mark, thinking that there must be a conclusion approaching really soon, and then there were 25 minutes left. The realization of the silliness of the plot becomes more apparent at that point. If there were about sixteen, seventeen minutes chopped off, and with tighter editing, then perhaps the film could improve significantly. There really was no need to stretch it out for as long as they did. Also that the characters weren't really worth being concerned with, which unfortunately is the case with many movies like this. Speaking of, this isn't really a horror film by the way, which is fine; it needn't be. It's basically a suspense/thriller. The body count is practically non-existent. Just an observation; not necessarily a strike against the film. This is just another disposable film that had really great marketing. Bravo! ""A new kind of horror"" as some critics have said and it paid off. People will defend it because it's basically divergent from what is mostly out there today. But I think that just because something is different doesn't necessarily make it good. I would give it a C-"

It feels like a college students sophomore project, with the arrogance of a teenage boy. I would love to praise it for what it tries to be, which is what others assume happened on screen, but I can't. It wasn't there; it was an attempt."

" is surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.5392,2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Well, i actually did not expect anything from this movie, especially after i saw this movie did not get many good reviews/stars. So i gave it a chance when i had no movie to watch, yet i found it entertaining. Just like other horror movies, it began with a scene where something bad had already happened as a prologue, and as an introduction. It was quite enigmatic, and made us guess what was really happened. Then the scene changed into the real story and character. Well, surprisingly, it was well-delivered story. As the story went on, the development of the character is well-built. I really enjoyed the movie. Even though the story was about sex, but the sex scene was not that vulgar. A kind of weird story, but i think the idea was original so it was nothing to be complained though. Maybe it was a low-budget movie, but it was definitely not a cheap story. Although it was not really scary, but at some scenes, it was quite thrilling and made you scream. And you don't have to wait until the movie end to know what's the matter so we don't have to keep asking the entire movie what it's all about.And what i like about this movie, it's a kind of classic ghost- horror, not a nonsense-reason slasher horror."
" Great Horror Flick

The first thing I want to mention about this movie is it's amazing background music. I thought the music that was playing in each scene worked perfectly. It was very eerie, and suspenseful. I will say that I think the whole cat and mouse idea with these people running away from something that is following them is kind of cheesy in some parts, but I think they did make it work overall. Personally the two people that was following the main character that was very creepy, and scary was where she was in class, and she looked out the window and saw the elderly women coming towards her. The blank expressionless face from the old lady was very dark. That scene reminded me back to like if I was watching The Shining. The other person that was creepier in comparison to the others was the giant man. You first see this man when they just open the door to Jay's bedroom. You see just her sister at first, but then through the darkness appears this giant man with blackened eyes.You only see him again briefly through a window in a shack that they are hiding in on the beach. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 for its exceptional music scoring, it's dark and creepy atmosphere, and for taking such a simple idea and making a very great movie out of it."

However, there were quite a few parts that I didn't care for, which I find common in horror/suspense movies. Characters make decisions that are just unlikely, in my opinion. Unfortunately, it seems this genre often requires people to make silly choices, or some nonsensical things to happen, to build suspense? or just because? Nonetheless, I call it poor execution. I did love the cinematography, the fact that it does have an 80s horror feel (especially the music/soundtrack)and the acting was pretty good. I like the fact that this movie is thought provoking, and doesn't spell everything out. So, you have to pay attention to catch or understand some of the story line. Yet, there are some things that are just unexplained, and maybe I just need to watch it again....but it wasn't that good that I would probably do that anytime soon. I have seen a lot of reviews that speak very highly of this movie, but I kinda feel its overrated. Much like the Babadook. It is deserving of a descent score but definitely does not come close to a nearly 7/10 stars. Perhaps, its somewhat obscure plot, and/or story line? Nonetheless, its definitely worth a watch whether it leaves you frustrated, or intrigued, I think that's kinda the charm of this flick."

'It Follows' achieves most of its scares purely psychologically and does a great job at building tension and the whole film has a really eerie atmosphere about it.This is a weird film, even for a horror.

A quite unusual storyline, which sees some unknown being torment it's victim perpetually, with only them able to see it, with the victim followed day and night without any let up. The only way to escape the grips of the being, to sleep with someone and pass the curse on, or so the theory goes anyhow. A pretty clever story with lots of twists. Well acted with some decent characters. The film has one help of an accompanying soundtrack, which is straight out of the eighties, big and brash, I loved it, worked so well for the film. Some great moments, most notably the beach scene, slow and very deliberate. If you've watched Torchwood, you'll know why I was reminded of an early episode.Really good film 8/10"
" Follow through this one!
",0.0,0.9066,2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"""It Follows""! Yes, it does! My grandiose corny puns in my movie reviews, and this one is no different! OK, OK. Please don't leave and I beg you to continue to follow me in my review of the horror independent flick ""It Follows"". Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell has formulated a very inventive horror movie about an unknown supernatural force that follows some of those who have sexual encounters. Our protagonist here is the blonde beauty Jay Height. Jay reaches her own new heights when she starts dating the all-American sporto Hugh. But Hugh will not guess what happens with that encounter, because then if I spill the beans, it will be a Hugh disappointment, and spoilers will follow. Sorry, but I can't resist. Hugh ends up giving Jay the supernatural force that causes weary characters to slowly follow; hence ""It Follows"". It might sound like ""It Follows"" is not it, but it is actually a very engaging movie, that does not mimic most of the formulaic hum-drum horror movies of these days. And it does have its scary moments, including a breakthrough beginning. So I think we should start following the career of David Robert Mitchell because he was it in crafting this feature. I also liked the leading performance of Maika Monroe as Jay. The rest of the cast was moderate but nothing to follow through profusely. OK, that is pretty much it. Now follow ""It Follows"". **** Good"
" A Pretty Unsettling Experience
",0.4939,0.1525,2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Whoa! I just watched one of the creepiest/spookiest films I've seen in quite a while, 2015's ""It Follows."" This film has turned out to be a popular success, an instant cult item and a critical favorite, garnering great reviews all over the place...and for good reason. In the film, pretty Jay (the excellent young actress Maika Monroe) has a sexual encounter with her current boyfriend, only to soon learn that he has passed on a curse to her. She will now be relentlessly pursued by a demon/whatzit/something wherever she goes. This whatzit can assume any form and never hurries toward its prey; only walks steadily and with purpose. To have it catch up with you spells a pretty nasty death, as the film's opening scene shows us, with another pretty victim. The only way to get this curse taken off your back is to have sex with someone else, passing the curse on effectively. But if that next person is killed by the entity, the curse reverts back to you. OK, it might sound like a pretty outlandish basis for a film, but believe me, writer/director David Robert Mitchell makes the most of it, and turns his film into a masterful exercise in horror. This is the kind of film that you just KNOW will give you a nightmare eventually. The film contains any number of frightening scenes, despite the fact that there is little overt violence and barely any blood. In my favorite, the whatzit takes the form of an old woman in pajamas, who relentlessly follows Jay through the corridors of her high school. The demon thingy later takes the form of a hollow-eyed man, a half-naked woman, Jay's own father, and on and on. Monroe is terribly sympathetic and appealing in the lead, and she is ably abetted by her young fellow actors. The film has of course been seen as a metaphor for the AIDS virus, but can be interpreted in other ways, as well. Some see the whatzit as a metaphor for the fear and uncertainty that can ensue after a sexual encounter. Others have commented that the great unease engendered by this film can be attributed to the fact that things are never really explained, and that the central whatzit has no name, such as, say, Jason, or Freddy Krueger. The ending of the picture is quite ambiguous, too, and also open to interpretation. A pretty unsettling experience, over all, and one whose spell lingers after the final reel. And, oh...the film looks amazing in high def; almost painfully crisp and clean looking. Very highly recommended, indeed!"

The suspense factor here is off the dial and it is truly riveting and you will not be able to turn away once you get into it.

" Misled by ""scary"" reviews & Thoughts on establishing rules
",0.0,0.9396,2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"I was thrown off by the time period in which the movie supposedly takes place. It was intentional per the director, but it was distracting. I think the movie needs to tell the viewer when the setting is somehow to let them know the ""rules""- for example a kid can't have a cell phone in a 90s movie, but it's expected for a movie in present day.There isn't a lot of dialogue, a vast majority of the ""sound"" is a very 80s dreamlike synthesizer which adds to the dreamy direction of the movie. It's very prettily filmed, but there are a lot of slowly- turning shots which seem pointless. There are also a few times that the director started a sense of dread with a scene, then messes it up with his choices. Here's what I mean: there is a scene where Jay (the protagonist) is walking through a dark house, the camera follows behind her, closely, so you know something is coming, but you don't know where. Right before the reveal happens, the director switches the shot to film from the monster's perspective in the next room, so when Jay walks into the room and is surprised, we aren't. The movie's ""rules"" for the monster are pretty rigid- it walks slowly in a straight line to its intended target, so by definition, you know that Jay isn't going to be surprised from behind, because it doesn't appear out of thin air. My point is, what could've been a good climax to a build up, ends up being secondhand.The final confrontation with the monster seems to bend the rules already established in the movie, so it falls flat. There are also two scenes in which two characters appear as if they are going to pass it on to random hosts, but nothing is shown (all other sexual encounters are) so it ends up again leading the viewer to question the established rules.Overall, I was extremely disappointed because I had read multiple accounts of this being the scariest movie in a decade, and I loved the concept, but the movie just isn't scary, and there are too many questions to make it a good piece of film. I'm not going to destroy it in the ratings because there is much worse (and the acting was actually good) but I feel like I'm below the average here, so I gave it a 6."

This is a movie about watching a sexually transmitted infection take on human form and slowly walk towards the main character. Most of this movie is watching someone walk. I assume this is supposed to build tension, I just found it annoying. I finished watching this film because I kept hoping something would happen, and I would have settled for anything other than walking.Given the plot of being killed by an STG, one would assume there'd be some moral decisions to make about passing on the STG. If there were, none of the characters cared, or the actors/writers/director simply couldn't communicate that through words or actions. I didn't like the characters. I didn't care when they died. I didn't care when they faked being afraid. I just wanted them to stop running away from the slowly walking STG so it would kill them and the movie would end.

" Like the demon that lumbers with deadly inevitability, It Follows stays with YOU...
",0.3612,-0.9913,2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"The indie scene is where horror lives today. Forgot the twentieth Halloween reboot or the January dump truck that unloads all the mid-budget horror flicks that the studio wants to die quietly. The past few years have given us Oculus, The Witch, Don't Breathe, and admittedly the return of M. Night Shyamalan to elevated B-movie form. Micro-budgets and filmmakers eager to subvert the genre are giving us some of the most well-crafted scares that we've had since a creative dearth gave us seven Saw movies.What elevates the best of the best with supernatural horror is a willingness toward social allegory. Our worst fears are the ones that hit closest to where and how we live. Cabin in the Woods and You're Next started the trend by slyly flipping the game board and suggesting that moviegoers are too clever for the same old song and dance. Enter It Follows, which takes a simple premise (a demon is slowly coming for you) and elevates it to sexual assault allegory. The demon is passed like an STD and can only be gotten rid of temporarily by passing it on to someone else. This raises questions about self-preservation. What lengths would you go to in order to prolong your life, but doom somebody else? Under the perilous and terrifying circumstances, taking up the ""doom somebody else"" sword isn't hard. Fear is a powerful motivator. Like an STD, passing it on won't save you though. It only ends up buying you more time. It's a hamster wheel situation. Death comes one way or another.Shot and performed with a delicate grace, It Follows steeps everything in a palpable terror. Its anachronistic setting complete with e-readers, tube televisions, classic cars, and a complete lack of cell phones is an ever-present reminder of the characters' futility. It's a perpetual post-recession dystopia full of dilapidation, overgrowth, and despair. And backed by haunting synths, it's a pall that never lifts.Like the demon that lumbers with deadly inevitability, It Follows stays with you. It's a terrifying perversion of the world we live in and a well-crafted showcase of what horror still has to offer"
" Two Absurdities
",0.0,-0.9934,2017-03-31 00:00:00,7,"When it comes to atmosphere and creepiness, ""It Follows"" does such a good job that one can only be dismayed the inclusion of a couple of unnecessary absurdities.Jay is a young woman in college who has sex with a guy named Hugh. Then he chloroforms her, takes her to a remote location, and ties her up to a wheelchair. Eventually, a slow-moving, zombie-like being appears, heading in their direction. Hugh explains to Jay that this being will follow her unrelentingly until it catches her. She must avoid this being until she has sex with someone else, thereby passing the curse on to him. The only people that can see this being are those who are presently being pursued, like Jay, and those who have been pursued by it in the past, like Hugh.Needless to say, it is an act of evil selfishness to pass this curse on intentionally, so we wonder why he didn't just have sex with Jay and then leave her to her doom. The reason, as Hugh explains, is that once it kills Jay, it will then go back to the previously cursed person and follow him. So, Hugh wants Jay to know what is happening so that she will avoid being caught by this being long enough to pass it on to someone else. In other words, he wants Jay to stay alive and pass it on for his own selfish reasons, not out of any concern for her.The first absurdity in all this is the whole chloroform-and-tied-to- the-wheel-chair bit. Hugh could have had sex with Jay and then driven her out to the remote place, where he could explain what he has done to her while waiting for the being to show up. Furthermore, Jay was sure to tell the police after being abducted that way, which she does. But if he had simply told her the story and let her see the being, the police would have ignored her had she repeated it to them. There would have been less risk for him that way.Those unnecessary melodramatics aside, the next absurdity is Hugh's encyclopedic knowledge on the subject. In the novel ""Dracula"" and in many vampire movies made based on it, there is a Van Helsing character, a learned professor who, among his many accomplishments, happens to be an expert on vampires. He explains all the rules, the ones involving crosses, mirrors, sunlight, and wooden stakes. So informed, the characters in the movie and we in the audience know what needs to be done. The question is, how did Hugh become the Van Helsing to this being that follows people around, how does he know all the rules? In other words, how does he know that if Jay dies the being will start pursuing him around again? Later, as Jeff, Hugh says he caught the curse from some woman he picked up in a bar whose name he didn't even know. So, how did he know that sex with her was the cause of his troubles? And if the woman in the bar told him, how did she know?If the curse is passed on through sex, there must have been a first person who acquired it spontaneously and not through sex, otherwise, we would have an infinite regress. There is no reason to think this first person would have known the rules, even if he had lived long enough to pass it on, which seems unlikely, since no one would have told him why some slow-moving person was walking toward him, especially since no one else could have seen it.There was no need for the abduction scene, and there was no need for Hugh/Jeff to have Van Helsing-like knowledge, only what he had acquired from personal experience, which need not have been much."

Well obviously not because we're desensitized at this point in society so nothing really scares us these days. But honestly this movie captures the scariest nightmare you just might ever have. I personally liked ""It Follows"" mainly because its low budget but it delivers a chilling creepy movie that makes me never want to go to Detroit because there are scary following sex ghosts there. Haha. So is it brilliant? Nah not really but it does keep you on the edge of the seat. It's a good example of when horror is done right and doesn't depend on jump scares to scare you. Best of all. What I liked about this movie is it has no moment where they research the haunting and get to the bottom of it like near every supernatural horror usually does. You know what I mean, they Google search and then take some trip to some person in some obscure place who knows all the answers. Nope! None of that. No priests, witch doctor's, mediums or supernatural experts! The closest we get to this ""research moment"" is the group of friends track down the guy who gave the girl the haunting curse. And he knows basically nothing. So this mystery just adds to the movie because it makes it more realistic not knowing.I recommend only if you truly like original horror movies that are not filled with slashing, gore and blood everywhere because there is none and I mean none of that.

" So Much Wasted Potential
",-0.539,-0.984,2017-03-21 00:00:00,3,"I showed this movie to my teenage niece. She's becoming a horror fan and I've shown her a few films, The Shining, Scream etc. We watched this together. I asked her what she thought. Now I've taken film criticism classes and television criticism classes and anyone who has taken those classes knows, sometimes you end up way over analyzing things. She was only fourteen at the times, so I figured she would have a some what less clouded view of the movie. And ... she hated it. I asked her why. She thought it over for a second and finally answered ""That girl stunk, she spent the whole movie looking bored or confused."" And that pretty much summed it up. Now I love horror films and this film really did have a great premise. This thing doesn't run or appear in your dreams or call you on the phone, but it just never stops. And I liked the visuals also. I loved the whole throw back 70's vibe. But the characters, they are just not there. They have no real development, personality or characterization. Mostly they just stare off into space and look sad. And that, is really lame. This is a problem a lot of movie have nowadays. They adopt that Terrence Malick style, where all emotions and feelings are kept at an arms length. Movies like Foxcatcher or the Master have the same problem. I'm not saying everything in a movie should be spelt out in black and white but everything shouldn't be vague and ambiguous as well.Its not very engaging. And the main character Jay, she is just so meh. Look at Halloween, the character of Laurie Strode wasn't exactly Hamlet but she did have a personality and she was likable and in the end you wanted to see her save the children and escape Michael Myers. Same thing with Kirsty Cotton in Hellraiser or Sidney Prescott in Scream and a ton of other movies. This movie is trying to emulate so many other horror and while it has some elements down pat, others it's missing entirely. At the end of the movie did anyone really care what happened to the Jay character. No, of course not.I know the critics liked it, but no, just no."

",-0.4215,-0.9519,2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"I rarely write a review, but when I saw the 7/8/9 star reviews for this movie I just felt compelled to do so.You have bad movies, you have utter garbage and then you get It Follows.So there is this ghost that will pursue you until you're dead. It walks constantly at the same speed, and the only way you can prevent it is to have sex with somebody else so it starts to follow him/her, instead of you. The movie has no plot at all, just teenagers running away from the unstoppable walking weirdo.Save the energy and go watch something else. It is my humble advice to anyone who hasn't yet watched this."
" Strange and Different Horror movie
",-0.6705,0.4428,2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"First of all, ""It Follows"" is filmed and directed very well. I liked the upgraded 80's feeling the movie was set in. Sometimes the famous horror movies of that time where clearly visible as role models. This is also represented in the basic theme of teenagers coping with their sexuality and adolescence.Without spoiling much, the concept of the movie is that some kind of ""disease"" is transmitted by having sex and is following the affected persons wherever they go. The movie isn't that scary but you feel some sort of tension. There are nearly no jump scares and the movie feels fresh, which I really appreciated.The movie though has it's flaws. Strangely the parents of all teenager are absent most of time, even when serious s*** is about to go down. There is no excuse mentioned. Something that I also recognized is that whenever it's convenient ""it"" shows up, regardless of it's previous location or the distances. And my major issue was, that I would have liked some more explanation (not the simple ones) of what is going on or if not a more unexpected finish of the movie.Actingwise the main character of Maika Monroe is the only one, which was decent. Some of the supporting cast members really felt more like movie characters or actors than real life people.The movie is a different and enjoyable horror movie. But don't expect too much, though."
" A Breath Of Fresh Air
",0.3182,-0.9809,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"In a time where horror movies are known for being full of predictable jump scares and horrible acting, It Follows breathes new life into the franchise through excellent acting, a very haunting atmosphere, and an original and frightening ""villain"". One interesting attribute of It Follows is its homage to original horror movies like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. In fact, the main ""villain"" of It Follows represents most classic horror icons due to it always moving at a walking pace. One distracting issue of It Follows is ""the rules"" which, due to not being fully explained, ends up being very distracting. Let's begin by talking about the strongest part of the movie:1.Atmosphere: The atmosphere in It Follows is what makes this movie truly terrifying. The haunting atmosphere is present throughout the whole movie and there isn't a time where It Follows shifts the tone. This tone is the strongest in scenes where the main character isn't moving due to knowing that ""It"" is getting closer and closer while the main character isn't moving.2.Characters: Perhaps one of the weakest part of modern horror films, the characters in It Follows are very strong and well-acted. Perhaps the best part of the characters is how relatable they are since the main character is suddenly thrust into a situation that she didn't want to be involved in. Also, the movie cleverly hints that the main character could be considered the monster as well due to being forced to give the curse to someone else to avoid dying.3.""It"": The idea behind ""It"" was really clever and original. While ""It"" being described as walking doesn't make it seem very intimidating, it slowly becomes more and more intimidating as time goes on and the main character begins to lose her guard. However, the way ""It"" kills the person with the curse is weird and kind of over-dramatic and the fact that ""It"" doesn't have a true form is disappointing.4.The Rules: Perhaps the weakest part of the movie would be the rules. While interesting, the rules can be pretty distracting due to some alternative scenarios not being answered. Also, even though the film clearly states that ""It"" is always walking towards whoever has the curse, there are at least two scenes where ""It"" is either described or shown standing still.In the end It Follows is a clever horror movie that focuses on conveying horror through tone instead of cheap jump scares as well as making very relatable characters that don't act very stupid for the most part. The homage to classic horror movies is also a nice touch (even if some scenes are clearly meant to be homage instead of being connected to the plot). Final Verdict: 8/10"
" A beautiful homage to the great horrors of the past
",0.6486,-0.9832,2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,"I know this movie polarized a lot of moviegoers and divided them into those who expected yet another very predictable but nonetheless fun teeny horror flick with a decent story line and a plot that does bear a lot of potential and those who just went to see it because of its retro looks. I for one am part of the second group and within my long time career of watching horror movies it was always the score that stuck in my head the most. I have to add that I always embark on movies, especially on those which are mostly known to transmit their messages in a very subtle way. Those have ""followed"" me the longest in my life. And I personally think that this is key for movies like 'It Follows'.Now, I will not go into any more detail about the plot of the movie, since that has been described many times and I don't need to point out any specifics here. I personally did not watch a trailer and just went to see it without any info. Looking back, I even think the story is kind of awkward but I'm also very sure that this awkwardness added a lot of suspense to the movie. Yet, for me the most influential part of the movie was its score. I read a lot of people hated it, simply put. For me, the score was what made this movie stand out, which made each scene a beautifully horrible picture, which added unbearable suspense throughout the movie and kept me on the edge of my seat all the time. It took ordinary dialogues to a level where I was expecting something to happen any second and it took those scenes, which were already dreadful to watch to a point where I was seriously reconsidering if I had ever seen anything like it. The amazing thing is that the movie can do all this horror while omitting scare jumps. Something I really hate in today's horror movies. I personally think scare jumps are a way to cheat yourself to suspense and discontent. Creating discomfort by simply combining pictures and sounds instead of forcing momentum into the scene, is something that is much harder to achieve and I feel 'It Follows' has outdone not only itself but most of the horror movies of the last 10 years.Long story short: Do not watch this movie, if you're not able to let yourself go into a film 100%. If you're someone who tries to put everything he sees into a rational and conservative overall picture, stay away from 'It Follows'. However, if you're like me, capable of being sucked into a film with every facet it brings to the table, I can absolutely promise you, you'll love 'It Follows'."
" lost 2 hours of my life....
",-0.3182,-0.5207,2017-03-02 00:00:00,1,"not sure if I was watching a different film here.Was total bunkum I wish I had spent the 2 hours picking my toe nails...Story = sleep with someone, pass on some unexplained zombie like stalking ghost, who for no apparent reason, just wants to smash your face in.I could have written this script on the back of a fag packet"
" A little tease of a movie
",-0.2516,-0.9875,2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The premise is actually very refreshing and promising. It invites all sorts of delicious possibilities that a true horror fan, one who doesn't need to be smacked upside the head, can appreciate. A girl has sex with her new boyfriend, who then for no explanation knocks her out and ties her up. My eyes start to roll as I assume I've wandered into a torture-porn horror flick, but NO. He drops the bomb: there's a thing chasing him, but that has now ended because he just passed it on to HER. He explains he had a fling a few weeks ago and ever since this entity has been stalking him; It can take the form of any person, strangers and loved ones alike. Its most distinguishing feature in all its forms is that it walks slowly, deliberately, and directly towards you at all times, never taking its eyes off you.The only way to get rid of it, he tells her, is to have sex with another in order to pass it on. It walks, slowly, so it's easily outran, but the thing is that it never stops ... NEVER. THAT is the core of true horror, the torturously slow inevitability of death.Unimaginative minds could see this as a shallow plot, but no - as the pieces fall into place you realize that this is really one hell of an idea. First, a few key pieces: 1) the thing cannot be seen by those who have not at one time had it, 2) Once you've had it, you can always see it, regardless if you're the one it's after or not, and 3) if it succeeds in killing its target, then it kills the person that had it prior, then the one prior to that, and so on and so forth.You must have sex with another in order to escape it, but at the same time you know that you're basically handing over a death sentence to whoever you sleep with. Kind of heavy for anyone with a conscience. This explains so much of what can be taken as bad acting in the beginning: mainly why the boyfriend didn't seem very enthusiastic during the act with our protagonist. Dude looked like he was being inconvenienced by having that beauty love him.Secondly, you realize that whoever you have sex with needs to pass it on. If they don't then it's back to you. SO you can't pick just anybody out of desperation, whomever you pass it onto needs to be attractive, easily able to bang somebody else down the road. This also means that you're forced to have that awkward ""Hey btw some monster will be stalking you from now on, best to have sex with someone else as soon as possible"" after-sex talk.With these pieces in play, we're all set to learn more about this thing! Can it be killed? If so, how - bullets? Drowning? Fire? Electricity? Or perhaps logic: What would happen if the current target has sex with a past target, and the past target is killed before they can pass it on? As the IT circles back on its past targets it will inevitably come to a gap caused by already killing the repeat target. What does it do then? Does that end the curse, or does it simply hop the gap and go to the next closest in line? Where did it come from, HOW FAR BACK DOES THIS THING GO?! I mean its origin story could've been EPIC.These possibilities, along with the usual enticing possibilities that come into play once it's known the thing can take the form of people you know and love, are never truly explored. The closest we get to fulfilling any of this potential is a son humped to death by his bare-chested, alcoholic mother (The thing of course) - which I got to say was pretty effectively chilling.Only one imaginative idea was tried in killing it; they set up a trap at the local high school (college?) swimming pool, encircling it with all sorts of plugged in appliances. I thought that was brilliant, and was on the edge of my seat to see how it would play out. I mean, could this thing swim? Is it possible to electrocute something in an Olympic sized swimming pool? Well, we're never shown because the thing starts walking around the pool kicking in all the appliances. Our protagonist doesn't fry, but it looked like all of them might've became unplugged when they were thrown, but who the hell knows.It was underwhelming. The thing had never showed intelligence (or really any will for that matter) before; it mindlessly stalks its prey regardless of the surroundings. Here all of a sudden it knows of electrocution and foils the plan by throwing all appliances into the pool. It's nonsensical on another level too, because if the protagonist dies by electrocution, then it surely would no longer be possible to hump the life out of her, now would it? This felt about halfway through the movie, but it abruptly ends soon afterwards. An awkward sex scene with her platonic male friend; they're walking down the street holding hands; could that be it far behind them?; credits roll. Lots of unfulfilled potential. We never know what happened between her and those guys at the beach. Seems she had sex with one, but if she did IT must've killed him pretty quickly afterwards. A Bullet has no effect earlier in the movie, but there by the pool we're expected to believe there's a chance it's dead? And if there's no chance it's dead, then the ending isn't open-ended, it's simply nonexistent.Not a keeper, but it exercised my imagination, and there were a number of scenes I found really lol funny. (""Be back for dinner dad!"" to the naked guy standing on her roof). I suggest you see it."
" Good movie.
",0.4404,0.8235,2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"This is a film that surprised me by the positive, for having moments in which leaves the viewer in suspense waiting for what can happen. The reason for not giving a better rating is because the characters did not search for the source of the ""virus"" that had plagued them throughout the film. The main character simply escaped while she could with her friends have sought out the source of the problem and try to destroy it, in my opinion I think if they had done so the movie would have some more interest and better content. But overall it was a good movie and a good / average rendering of the main characters."
" Follow Through
",0.0,0.9717,2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Some movies simply put me to sleep. Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy"" is a great example of one where it took a few separate viewing to make it through. It Follows turns out to be another. I don't know if it is the leisurely pace, the lack of action, or the nebulous antagonist but it worked like a knockout gas on me. The movie's premise is actually quite good. If you sleep with someone an unstoppable monster will chase you until you sleep with someone else and then they will chase them and so forth. The solution to such a curse seems fairly straightforward, particularly for an attractive blonde teen girl. Go to a swingers club in say Las Vegas. Since the monster moves at a simple walking pace by the time it reaches Vegas you will have twenty or so partners at the very least ahead of yourself. Alas, it wouldn't be a horror movie if the characters spent five minutes thinking of a logical way out their predicament. So instead she and her Scooby gang spend the movie making sure the ""monster"" can find them. The movie has some very effective scenes and set pieces. It is certainly not a bad film at all. The mixing of styles and technology give a dreamy sense out of time. The acting is naturalistic. I think maybe I am just too old for the movie. For example one of the main characters is the childhood friend who holds a torch for the protagonist and who has stuck by her side as she has dated others who use her and throw her away while he sits from afar and painfully pines. I am old enough to recognize this as a classic ""nice guy"". I am also old enough to understand this is a fate worse than any monster. Maybe this movie is scarier than I thought."
" Good Premise - not fully utilised.
",0.4404,-0.7506,2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"The premise of this film is a good one - a person has sex and a supernatural spirit begins to follow them, with the intention of murdering them. The only way for that person to survive the entity is to have sex with someone and pass the ""curse"" onto them. Should they die then the spirit reverts back to following the last person once again.Unfortunately, the premise is not fully utilised in the story, there are quite a few holes. The main hole in the story is the origin of the ""curse""; we are not told it is a curse, it may be something else; we are not told why the killings are happening; or how it all started. These things deter from the story because at the end of the movie these issues made me feel as though the story was incomplete and lacking.Had these issues been resolved it would have made the story and the movie a lot stronger, and possibly a lot darker and more haunting.Taking that into consideration, what you do get in this movie is a strange surreal feeling, this is due to the direction and the soundtrack. These are very reminiscent of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg. It's as though they had a baby and his name was David Robert Mitchell.The opening scene has John Carpenter's Halloween written all over it. The entire film took me back to my youth in the 80's and I loved it. Sometimes, though, the soundtrack was too jarring, as Cronenberg's electronic soundtrack was apt to be, though here it doesn't work as well.The acting is above average with the mostly unknown cast doing a pretty decent job of adding to the tension and atmosphere of the movie. Even though there's not much gore, it's the palpable tension and atmosphere which make this a spooky supernatural story.So if you like a slow burning taut eerie tale then this could be right up your street."
" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,0.7649,2017-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Where should i start? This was a very disappointing movie!There was no explanation in regards to what""It"" was and why it followed.This is one of those movies with an ending like what the heck?!An abrupt ending that made absolutely no sense.I wasted my time watching this thinking it would get better.There were too many unanswered questions for my liking.Perhaps the teens will like this and find this interesting.I guess I'm too old for this movie because it seemed juvenile in nature.Teens having sex to get rid of ""It"" is a preposterous idea.When i saw the trailer for this itooked intetesting.I didn't get to see it on the big screen but watched it on Netflix.So very glad i didn't waste any money going to see this."
" Disappointed and IT FOLLOWS ME!!!
",-0.6093,0.9764,2017-02-02 00:00:00,3,"Whoever recommended ""It Follows"" to me, with all my respect--- never mind, I'll save it. But just watched it last night and here's what I think: Great visuals and cinematography, some really cool eerie music, awful writing and story, decent to average acting, but then again due to the horrendous story writing. First of all- all characters are unlikable and 10 minutes into the movie and I have no problem with them dying already because I never cared enough for any of them in the first place. All typical, shallow, flat undeveloped characters with bad attitudes. Sorry but it takes more than just being really pretty to care if s*** starts happening to you. We talk a lot about the importance of writing characters that readers like or can relate to, but this- -? Storyline: basically something really creepy FOLLOWS you and you have to sleep around with people to pass it on/along to them and hopefully maybe it will stop following you and follow them instead- or maybe not? We know nothing about that thing's backstory or why it's doing the horrible things that it's doing, how does it work and does it just pick people? Did it just show up one day? Are they like zombies or ghosts? Again what do they want? Nothing is explained. Now general stupidity and character errors: The lead is at home with her sister and THREE other friends when she starts seeing that ""thing"" and it starts following her so she hides in her room. She goes from NOT being OK if her sister leaves her with their THREE other friends in her bedroom to go get her some water just from the kitchen downstairs, freaking out about it telling her ""don't leave me"", she goes from that to running in the creepiest woods all ALONE just like a minute later. I'm like are you bipolar? A minute ago you yelled at your sister when she offered to go get you some water while your 3 other friends are sitting with you to protect and comfort you- again in your room, the safest place, and now you're wandering ALONE in the middle of the night just to sit in a swing? It's like an accident waiting to happen. How do you connect these two? Just stupid. And then the incredibly slow pace at times, like how much time do you need to tell that someone is swimming in the pool? 5 Minutes?! BORING! Now expositions that just aren't believable: ""When I was a little girl, my parents wouldn't allow me to go south of eight mile. I mean I had to ask permission to go to the state fair with my best friend and her parents just because it was a few blocks past the border!!"" Now I would buy that if I see anything that proves it from today's life. I've only seen your mom in like one scene in the beginning of the movie that's an hour and a half long, you're still underage and you go to school, your mom/ parents have no clue where you're spending your days and nights or what's going on with you when you have all your friends over; we just never see her. One night you sleep in a public park, in a swing, the other night on top of your car not even in it, and then on the beach the day after, and then in an isolated cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere that you drove to with your bunch of teenage friends. And then 3 days in a hospital?! Where's the so called overly protective mother in all of this? Knowing that she did appear at the beginning. Could they not hire her for a few more scenes? And then the resolution at the end- what resolution?! Still, nothing is explained?! I was hoping something would happen at the end that would miraculously change my mind, blow me away and surprise me, it did but for all the wrong reasons. I wouldn't say it was a total waste of time despite how frustrated I was when it ended, because the shots and cinematography were dope and gave me some great ideas!! IMDb ratings, I always knew you weren't to be trusted!! People, how could you possibly suggest it telling me ""it's the best horror movie ever!!"" Have you NOT learned proper screen writing?!"
" Minimalist Horror
",-0.5719,0.9967,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I know I'm far from alone in this, but I LOVED this movie. It debuted at Cannes in 2014 and when it had its worldwide release in 2015 it grossed over $20 million. The writer and director, David Robert Mitchell, developed the movie and was inspired in part by recurring dreams he had in his youth about being followed. Aesthetically, Mitchell and director of photography, Mike Gioulakis, were inspired by the ""surreal suburban imagery"" of American photographer Gregory Crewdson. It is absolutely minimalist horror at its finest.The story primarily follows Jay (Maika Monroe) as well as her sister, Kelly (Lili Sepe), her childhood friend, Paul (Keir Gilchrist, a favorite of mine), her friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi), and their neighbor, Greg (Daniel Zovatto). Jay has a frightening experience while on a date with Hugh (Jake Weary) wherein they sleep together and then he knocks her out with chloroform and she awakens and is informed that he has passed along some kind of mysterious, pursuing, murderous entity onto her a curse of sorts. She is shaken but skeptical at first, until she starts to see evidence that he is right after all, and her and her friends try to figure out what ""it"" is and how to stop it.Where do begin to count the all the ways that I love this movie? Firstly, the music is great. Honesty, I often don't notice the music in many movies — not that the music is bad, per se, but I find that it's sadly rare when the music truly FITS the mood of a film. Rich Vreeland, also known as Disasterpeace, scored It Follows and I think he succeeded in coming up with a soundtrack that is sufficiently sinister and foreboding. It helps to add to the claustrophobia of the entire film, the sick, slow dread.They did an amazing job at creating a general sense of unease in the film. Between the settings, the weird combination of technology (Yara uses that awesome clamshell phone/e-reader, and yet only corded phones abound around them, for example), the wardrobe, and even the perceived temperature, you are never fully able to figure out WHAT is going on, and it throws you into this very subtle sense of confusion.The adults in the movie are very intentionally kept out of focus — sometimes literally. It is meant to only focus on the teenagers and their mission, and I think in a way it adds to that sort of surreal atmosphere.There are a few camera shots that stood out, but the main one for me was the wild 720-degree shot in the school hallway, panning right by one of the lurching creatures on its way around. Brilliant.The whole thing has a very Stranger Things vibe, particularly because of the friends' willingness to help Jay — they are just unwavering in their support and belief — and then solidified when the whole thing ends at the pool. Though I much prefer the atmosphere (and music!) of Stranger Things — basically what I'm saying is if you enjoyed this movie, go check out that show NOW. Funny, too, that Disasterpeace was actually asked to do the music for Stranger Things but he turned it down, citing a desire to not be too pigeonholed in the 80's-inspired genre.It is minimalist horror in the sense that we only actually see the full capabilities of ""it"" a handful of times throughout the movie (though when we do, it is super effective). It doesn't focus on gore or even shock effects or jump scares. It's just this slow burning, creeping dread this feeling of not being able to escape no matter how hard you try. The ""monster"" in this movie is vague, undefined, and shifting, which I think gives it a lot of power. It's not disgusting and deformed, it doesn't have a disturbing back story, it isn't cocky and taunting it just IS. As Mitchell himself has said, ""There's no logic to it—you can't really explain a nightmare.""And then we have the ending, which is surprisingly romantic and intimate. Paul is willing to do anything for Jay — to even risk his own life in a pursuit to save hers — and it's beautiful in a sad way.Intelligent, daring, and thought-provoking and it's on Netflix, so you've got no excuse. Go!"
" It Follows isn't the worst thing ever, but please don't waste your time
",0.7961,0.2247,2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"I'm gonna try and make this as clear as possible. It Follows fails at being a horror movie, and it even struggles at being a thriller. If you are wanting to watch a scary movie, than this isn't the movie for you. I'm giving it a 3 because at a lot of points in the movie, you have hope that the story and pace is going to pick up. I give it props for trying, but it was a huge huge let down considering how many people raved about it. If you can overlook a scary movie not being remotely scary, than the plot will surely steer you away. They explain pretty much nothing in this movie, even though it seems like they're going to at a lot of points. They don't tell you what ""it"" is, anything about its origins or why it follows you. Naturally, with this being a rare spin on the horror genre, the audience is going to want to know some type of background information or any information at all for that matter because we can't really refer to any other movies or TV to help us fill in the blanks. Overall, the movie is filled with lots of build ups that lead to nothing, with a complete lack of explanation that leave the audience bored and confused."
" Ambiguous Time Period
",0.0,-0.3804,2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"I like it, but I do understand why others did not. My favorite thing about it was how they made it seems like it was in the 80s, even though they don't make a statement about it as such.There are no computers, no cell phones, an old station wagon, old phones, old t.v.s, black and white movies, and casual sex. This is in the tradition of classic horror flicks of that era. But they don't actually claim it is in the 80s. Because for example, you will see some modern cars too.I also loved the photography of suburban Michigan. That includes the shots of perfect cul-de-sacs, woodsy roads, and lake beaches. Of course for men there is the main character to ogle. She's just old enough so that it's not too creepy, and she's truly as appealing as her character is meant to be.The creatures walk at zombie pace. You can't help but laugh. The plot is probably meant to be fun and different, and it is. Having sex makes zombies stalk you, and having sex again makes zombies stalk your new partner.Yes the ending was disappointing, both for lack of action and lack of explanation. But sometimes the journey there is worth watching."
" Brilliant Monster Movie
",0.5859,0.9674,2017-01-19 00:00:00,9,"It Follows is a movie about a monster that is an STD. If you catch the STD - it will follow you as your worst fears until it catches and kills you. The only way to escape the monster is to pass the STD on to another person. If the monster kills the other person - it will come back for you. The monster is ruthless - cruel - intelligent - and a master of fear. Scary!The story is told like a dream - where the rules of the world change slightly as the story goes along - much like how in a dream the rules of the dream will transform and become more abstract as the dreamer get closer to waking up. Some people have complained about the story changing - but I felt it was intentional and pushed the story forward. The tale is also told in a timeless manner - for example - it seems like the 1970's but there is a seashell that one of the young teens uses as if it is a cell phone - or a computer screen. This shows that the world exists in ""any"" time - it can be the past, present, or some future. Or some dimension. Or - some dream. It seems to deal with the Jungian theme of the innocent - which is to say - that the fear of the innocent in the Jung archetype is to be in trouble. To be caught. This is a film about innocent people who step forth into the world and are afraid of their actions coming back to haunt them. Much like all of us are at one time innocent - and take the first steps into being an adult - and fear what may come from that breakthrough. The soundtrack is eerie - and it makes the movie feel a bit like The Shining - or even There Will Be Blood. The shots are well set up - and in general - the movie is just a masterfully unique experience. I love monster movies and I loved this one. A good monster needs to have a scare that is relevant to a majority of the population and a story that engages an audience. It Follows does just that - and deserves its praise."
" Clever Premise, Poorly Done
",0.4588,-0.6662,2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"With a 97% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes and so many glowing reviews, this was a must see for me. Can that many critics be wrong? Or what did I miss? I love a good horror movie, especially one that is fresh and creative...unfortunately, this wasn't. For once, I agree with all the 1 star reviews. I almost turned it off when I was bored through the whole beginning, but I figured it just needed time to develop...it will get good. I was wrong. The filmmakers had a great concept, but squandered it in the execution. So many things didn't make sense that it frustrated me. The pacing was slow (which works when significant tension has been built, i.e. The Conjuring series), but here it just comes across as flat and dull. In trying to figure out what would happen next I found myself writing a better movie in my head. I can forgive some plot holes, stupidity and unexplained inconsistencies to a point, but I have to be entertained. I don't like finishing a movie and saying, ""Why did I watch that?"" I should have watched Lights Out for the 13th time."
" Just one big, bad STD
",-0.5423,-0.681,2017-01-17 00:00:00,2,"This movie was... Bad, to say the least. The only reason I gave it a 2* is because of the fact that it takes place in Detroit(where I grew up) and I guess the acting is okay, for teenagers/early 20 year olds. Other than that, the movie was all negatives for me. If a horror movie is literally about sex, you know it's going to be bad, let's be honest now.. Its like a slightly less shi**y version of ""Teeth"". There were times in the movie that simply just don't make sense and it also feels really unfinished. I guess that could be a follow up for the sequel, which I won't be watching if there is one. There are much better modern horror movie out there that have not as much regocnition as movies like this (movies such an ""Hush"") which frankly blows my mind. I'm astonished this movie was actually released in theater's by me, but I guess they're just reaching out to the younger people in society and teaching them about unsafe sex. Sounds like America to me. Bad movie. Don't waste your time unless you're into garbage fuckfests horror movie like ""wrong turn 6""."
" not a horror
",0.4585,-0.8918,2017-01-14 00:00:00,4,"Film started very well but later on there's no horror action. I really expected to see more of it. The scene when he takes here in the abandoned facility is the high top of the movie which is kinda sad as I thought the movie starts here. Naked girl approaching Annie is maximum out the movie. Movie isn't scary as it self but it's labeled as a horror. I almost fell a sleep as I saw nothing is happening, just few ghosts and girl running from it, that's all. It's like a 70's and 80's horror which used to be scary at that time but in 2017 this film isn't scary at all, only few scary scenes. I wasn't entertained and the movie is for the sufficient grade."
" Holy cow the bad reviews here are stupid
",-0.7845,-0.8635,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This film takes a simple idea and translates it into an extended exercise of moody terror. There are no wasted gestures; everything accumulates towards a clear message that somehow people take to be a propaganda film about abstinence. Here's an idea: Growing up is scary, and adults (despite their best intentions) have no real idea of what is on a teenager's mind. In the world of the film, young people are forced to face inevitable transformations at the hands of forces they don't understand, plagued by desires they can't necessarily control. This film is about losing innocence and realizing that the world isn't fair. There are some jump scares and graphic intensity, but the real heart of the film is in the dialogue and feelings of the characters. It's as if someone took a slasher flick and made the characters real people, with vulnerability and emotion instead of plastic surgery boobs and six pack abs."
" Almost a guilty-pleasure film
",0.0,0.9694,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"It Follows might have been fantastic horror, but it had too many rookie-filmmaker mistakes.It seems Mitchell tried to make cerebral horror film, which would make people think and be scared at the same time. Well, it didn't quite work out for me. The tension was there, the premise was great, the setting was fantastic and the film didn't gave the audience all the answers, so the viewers could come up with answers themselves. Unfortunately, Mitchell left out too many puzzle pieces so viewer couldn't really understand what kind of questions should one start asking in the first place. I was scared a bit while watching this film, I felt the sense of hopelessness as the main character probably did, but it wasn't as scary as some other great horror films like The Conjuring or Halloween. Maybe because of the pacing and there was too much time between those scary moments. I believe that the music score also took away some part of the horror aspect from It Follows. Mitchells relied too much on the music to build up tension and it the music spoiled the moments by pointing out when we should be waiting for something scary to happen. The music could be more subtle, just like the entity which followed.The editing was very amateurish, I couldn't stand it. Everyone praises the cinematography of ""It Follows"" and it was the main reasons why I really wanted to see this film. I'm total sucker for great cinematography in films. It Follows tried to have great cinematography, but way too many times we had bad shots. Like the camera was shaking, or the cinematographer overdid the panning. Don't get me wrong, It Follows has mostly great shots, but also too many bad ones. In conclusion: It Follows had interesting setting, relatable characters, great musical score (although overused in some cases), overall good cinematography (as mentioned it had bad shots), but with horrible editing and story which was meant to make audience members think, but left out too many puzzle pieces, which didn't make the film better in anyway.I would like to believe it might be someone's guilty pleasure movie, but ""It Follows"" isn't even that . It's somewhere in between. It's too bad to be genuinely enjoyable and too good to be ""so bad that it's good""."
" Catch it if you can.
",0.0,-0.9192,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"We're all familiar with the old slasher movie trope 'Have sex and die'; well, that's what happens in It Follows, but it's not a machete wielding maniac who comes a-calling after its characters bump uglies but rather a deadly STD: a Sexually Transmitted Demon!After dropping her knickers for boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary), pretty teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) is informed that she is now being followed by a supernatural entity that will kill her if it catches up with her, and that the only way to stop it from doing so is to 'pass it on'. Understandably upset, Jay confides in her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and friends Paul and Yara (Keir Gilchrist and Olivia Luccardi), who are somewhat sceptical but willing to help. With the malevolent being approaching at walking speed, Jay has plenty of time to consider her options, but must keep an ever watchful eye out for the creature, which can take on many different guises and is invisible to the uninfected.Like its monster, It Follows moves at a steady pace, but is never dull thanks to its ingenious plot, engaging performances from its talented young cast, and spot-on handling from writer/director David Robert Mitchell, who cleverly keeps the viewer as much on their toes as the film's central character. While the subject is somewhat reminiscent of J-horror classic Ringu, the atmosphere Mitchell achieves is more akin to the foreboding tension of John Carpenter's Halloween, with careful framing of each shot leading to heightened tension, and a suitably brooding synth score (by Disasterpeace) only adding to the fear factor. Gore is minimal, but effective when used (the early sight of one victim with her leg bent backwards, knee broken open, shows the true horror of the curse).In a world where so many horror films are content with delivering cheap, jump scares, and practically non-existent character development, It Follows makes for a very refreshing change."
" I want the two hours of my life I just wasted back!!
",-0.5399,-0.9281,2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I am never taking user reviews seriously on IMDb again after this disaster of a viewing! This could have been a good thriller/suspense film if anything at any point in this mess had been explained properly. The movie has a simple premise:girl meets boy,they go out on a date and then after having sex in his car he tells her that ""it"" will be coming for her soon and ""it"" can look like anybody. He advises her to sleep with someone asap to pass the curse along and to pretty please not let it kill her or it will come back after him. That and the rambling opening scene of a scared girl running from something only she can see and subsequently turning up brutally murdered on a beach are all the hints you ever get about what the hell ""it"" is. The whole other hour and a half before the non-ending is just literally pointless dramatic music and the girl and her friends trying to stay ahead of ""it"". Since the thing just seems to walk after her slowly in one human body or another (sometimes decaying and sometimes nice and fresh) ""it"" isn't even sort of scary. Just granny ambling in her nightgown or a little kid with a vacant expression shuffling down the sidewalk etc. The motive of the being is never explained nor does the film actually have a ending... besides just randomly ending after a bunch of nothing. So basically, confusing opening, confusing (and super boring) middle..and no end. No plot. No big reveal.Boring,almost inanimate characters who barely talk..and all these ringer reviews talking about how ""smart"" this movie was. Unless you just want the ambient background noise of your TV playing this movie while you take a two hour nap I would highly suggest watching ANYTHING else you can."
" Great concept, great execution, but one major problem.
",0.1406,-0.995,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"The reason I gave the movie such a bad review is because it had so much potential and, for the most part, was actually a fantastic horror film. For about the first half of the movie, I was genuinely creeped out. There were a lot of unnecessary shots of naked women and people having sex, but I was able to ignore those parts, so they only ruined the atmosphere a bit. It was an annoying, but unfortunately common enough occurrence in horror films for me to be used to it. However, at the climax of the film, the 'It' that has been following Jay the whole time catches up with Greg (who she, of course, had on-screen sex with). The fact that the film shows us what happens when it catches up to you removes a lot of the suspense and mystery of the concept- it makes the monster a lot less scary, because anything it does is infinitely less scary than anything the audience's imagination comes up with. But what's even worse than ruining the first rule of horror movies is the actual action it takes- apparently, this monster kills you by having sex with you. I'm not sure what I expected, but the moment the camera shows us Greg's mom and him together, the movie immediately lost any feeling of terror it had just because of the sheer ridiculousness of it. What had been a really cool, creepy, and unique concept, and would have made a great movie with a lot of really cool details in the setting and through recurring imagery, was ultimately ruined by the director's libido and inability to show women on screen without them having sex or being viewed sexually."
