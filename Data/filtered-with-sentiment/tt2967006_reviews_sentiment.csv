" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.0258,2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,"Recycled jokes from series just in another country, got bored"
" A pleasure, but somewhat diminished from the original THE TRIP
",0.6486,0.9972,2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"I guess the original film THE TRIP had a bit of newness to it, because #2 in the series was a little less entertaining, even though it was very much ""more of the same"" that we got in the first film. But Rob Brydon's impersonations have lost some of their lustre (and he physically works SO hard when doing some of them, it's a little uncomfortable to watch)...where his Michael Caine amazed before and his Hugh Grant amused before, they now seem like a lazy way to fill the running time of the movie.The best parts of the film are still the easy, bristling exchanges between Coogan and Brydon. They are friends who have a lot of grievances with each other. (And you can practically see Coogan's skin crawl when he realizes Brydon may get a big role in a Michael Mann film.) Yet, they are both so sharp and sharp-witted and so amused by each other, we can't help but be drawn in. They love film, and for a film-lover, that makes these movies irresistible. How often I wanted to be able to jump in and join the conversation!The beauty factor in ITALY is higher than the original TRIP (through Northern England). Not that the English countryside isn't lovely, but the cinematography in that film was a bit more drab, and in the sequel, Italy positively sparkles. It's tough to beat the Amalfi Coast, where much of this takes place.And there are moments when the men are NOT with each other, and really, any moments of plot development really happen here, whether it's Brydon's interactions with a lovely ""captain"" or Coogan's outreach to his teen son. We're seeing these men age (though not always gracefully and not always in a way that shows wisdom coming with that age), and that's interesting. The understand themselves better, but also understand how much they've failed to improve themselves.It was all very entertaining. But too many scenes felt like retreads of scenes from film one. Now, it's possible that watching these two movies 5 days apart was a mistake. I have TRIP TO SPAIN on order, but I think I'll wait a month or so to watch.(And a final complaint, that says more about me than the movie...I enjoyed the food in movie 1, in part because the servers always took time to ""introduce"" the dish to Coogan and Brydon. They do the same here, but almost always in Italian, which I don't understand, so I missed being able to look at the food and understand what it all was. I saw pasta, and gathered there was a lot of seafood, but that's about it.)This film (and I wager ALL in the series) is not for everyone. But if you love film, or dry British humor or Steve Coogan (and my wife and I love all 3), then this intelligent, entertaining journey should afford you a very nice evening."
" Never again would be too soon!!!
",0.0,0.7115,2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"This is like sitting next to two drunk men outside a closed pub, having to wait for the next ferry next to them due to the heavy rain.The final credits was BY FAR the best part of the film. The only part worth to see again. I bought the film on sale for around 4,50 euros, isn't worth even 45 cents.The film was so completely terrible that I had to get myself an account here to express my frustration, and to warn others even slightly thinking of watching it - go for a walk in the rain, that's far, far more exciting."
" Italy Discovered
",0.0,0.6655,2020-08-02 00:00:00,6,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Winterbottom's work which is fully on display in this modest travel journal of two friends discovering the joys of Italy. Steve Coogan & Rob Brydon, the friends in question, I'll admit are an acquired taste; one that I've not yet...acquired. I kept resisting the urge to just mute the sound so I didn't have to listen to their inane, extremely irritating, babblings was only because Strauss and Mahler were used expertly on the soundtrack. And who would want to miss that? The food, the scenery and an undefined longing are all very appealing. But the self-centered mugging by the two, which we're clued to think is adorable by women, I just think needs a warning to any viewer. Try to shut them out. 'Cause they never shut up."
" Talking wirh food in their mouths
",0.0,0.6369,2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,"Love these movies, except when they talk with food in their mouths. I guess it's an English thing"
" What was I thinking?
",0.0,0.661,2020-04-12 00:00:00,1,"My wife and I wanted to see this mainly because we love Italy. Well, dear oh dear, what a let down. The movie was so boring that I literally fell asleep, and to my wife's disgust actually started snoring!!
After a prod or two I did manage to come out of my slumber, and we both endured the rest of this painful movie until its conclusion, just in case it improved. Sadly it did not.
Probably the worst movie I've ever sat through"
" Stinking movie
",-0.5267,0.7777,2019-10-22 00:00:00,3,"This kind of movies must been seen only on the English island !
Please do not export your civilization
You can still enjoy though ;-)"
" Skip this one, go straight to the third Trip
",0.2263,0.0831,2019-04-02 00:00:00,5,"I watched the first Trip movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Naturally I expected the sequels to bring more of the same wit and artsy production, but I found myself quite bored during this one. The Trip to Italy is not good, it's not bad, but it felt like a waste of my time. I couldn't get over the dialogue, which is painfully unrealistic despite being framed as genuine. The third Trip movie, The Trip to Spain, is much better and a return to form. Unless you want to tire yourself with nearly two hours of uninteresting and unbelievable comments, skip this Trip and watch the first and third ones."

" Smart.. Peace.. Beauty
",0.5859,0.9937,2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a real smart movie.. Taking your rhythm and anxiety to a very peaceful zone, restore your serinity.. I admit, it's a bit boring.. But this is the idea.. Sort of relaxation you should surrender to the stream and give up your regular thoughts about love, sex, excitement, show Biz, etc.. Just let the sun shine on your face.
I encourage to make it series movies, but don't be so specific in the dialogue to movie biz, make it more rich to suit other people and different occasions.. Maintain the slow rhythm and ambience.. No music is a good idea.. Nature and scenes are suburb and sufficient glamorous.. Great GREAT!! I FOUND MYSELF PAYING FULL ATTENTION DURING THE PLAY.."
" Picking up where The Trip left off, overall it works
",0.0,0.9484,2018-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Michael Winterbottom's insight behind The Trip was to simply put Brydon and Coogan together in front of the camera and let them get on with it; despite reservations by the pair, the instinct was the correct one. The Trip to Italy picks up where The Trip leaves off - food, scenery, and the on-screen chemistry, a bromance/rivalry, between Brydon and Coogan. Again, Brydon manages to find an opportunity for his set-piece, his 'man-in-the-box' voice. In some ways, it's reminiscent of the on-screen chemistry on the Top Gear 'road trips' (another TV show that relies upon middle-aged men playing versions of themselves), but the humour is kinder, more clever; less juvenile. Badinage perhaps, rather than banter. Light-hearted, overall it works even if, at times, it starts to become self-indulgent."
" Real life Smashey and Nicey talk over the top of an actual film
",0.2023,0.968,2018-02-27 00:00:00,1,If you've ever been to a movie where you wanted to see what was going on and there were two really annoying clowns in front of you who insisted on not just talking over the entire event but in doing so while pretending to be other people - this is what happens.It very much looked like the two lead characters wanted a way for someone else to pay for their road trip around Italy including food and accomodation and decided a mockumentary travel film would achieve that. Despite their almost complete indifference to the food and some amazing scenery the parts of Italy that we see still looks great. I had hoped there might be actual story in there but sadly not. The only target market for this film would be people who think doing voice impressions of actual famous actors is a good thing. The only sane way to watch this would be with the sound off.
" So Disappointing
",-0.5413,0.4279,2018-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Hard to believe that two people driving around Italy and eating great food would be so irritating. There is more half-assed impersonations of Al Pacino and Robert DiNero than comment on the food, the scenery, or five star lodgings. Mute the sound, fast forward as needed, and you can knock this one off in less than ten minutes. You'll be glad you did."
" A movie to be enjoyed by those with intelligence and wit!
",0.7712,0.9937,2018-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Bright, subtle humor that can only be appreciated by those with an IQ above a moronic level! I would love to see a third! The second was an excellent complement to 'The Trip' through the Lakes District. The Trip to Italy is stunningly filmed, wonderfully scored (in particular 'Im Abendrot' by Richard Strauss, absolutely heart rending as well as the only piece I could identify or remember for that matter apart from Alanis) and brilliantly directed. Those inclined to shoot-em ups and CGI will never be able to appreciate a movie this clever and intelligent! Mr. Brydon and Mr. Coogan please do this again. Steve and Rob's chemistry feels genuine and I wonder if they wouldn't mind spooning on the side of the Eiger? Just joking guys! Please choose another region of Europe where you can tie in some other famous English literary giants (Perhaps Kipling and Housman with their ties to France?) and in the process teach the untutored masses something. I say this despite not having much hope for the average viewing audience! So in closing I conclude by 
thoroughly encouraging those with wit and intelligence to relish this gem! For those not fitting those parameters give it a skip so I don't have to read your inane comments! By the by Byron and Shelley socialized, Shelley wrote that his contact with Byron led to a drive in his own poetic output, and, following a boating tour with Byron, was inspired to write his 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty'."
" On the exact same formula as The Trip
",0.0,0.8654,2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"If you liked The Trip, you will like this one, as it is basically the same movie. The same people, the same jokes, the same outdoors and food shots. The only thing that changed is that instead of 44, they are now closer to 50. Their hair is more gray and less. How they relate to the world has changed, children grew up. And, of course, they're in Italy.To me, one of the failings of the film is that it doesn't really portray the places so well. I understand it's a character piece, but by limiting the surroundings, they also make the movie feel more like a play, diminished in scope, if not in meaning.Still, if you watched The Trip and wanted more, watch this, too."
" Another good holiday with the two oddballs
",0.6808,0.9939,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"It's now four years later and Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are offered another restaurant reviewing gig - this time in Italy, rather than England's Lake District. What qualifies them exactly, who knows, but the actors - and the semi-fictionalised characters they play - are pretty lucky. They get to stay in amazing hotels with fantastic views, drive around the beautiful Italian coast, drink quality local wine and try great-looking Italian cuisine. One thing's for sure - this film acts as much as an Italian tourism promotion as it does anything else! I certainly wouldn't mind visiting Naples now I've seen it...Now much closer to 50 than 40, there's plenty of digs at each other, as this is basically a 'man-cation' where they try to see who's more famous/who has the bigger ego, as well as lots of postulating as to how (or if) they'll be remembered when they're gone. There's a tangent of following Lord Byron and Mary Shelley's personal history, that doesn't really go anywhere. If this and the Rob having a bit of a mid-life crisis/affair bits were left out, it would have been a much more streamlined and succinct film.The whole point though is to watch these two interact and do their impressions, constantly trying to outdo each other. There's some truly great impressions, from Michael Caine (again), Tom Hardy, Christian Bale, Hugh Grant, Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Pierce Bronsan and more. How accurate some of them are is uncanny, but watching Steve & Rob interact in character is often hilarious."
" What a Waste of Time...Boring, boring, booooooooring.
",-0.6249,0.7058,2017-10-24 00:00:00,2,"As if The Trip in 2010 was not bad enough, they have done another trip?!! Consider this a review for both the 2010 and 2014 because they are exactly the same movie, with just a different country.First of all, there is no dialogue or script. They just say whatever comes to their minds, regardless of how relevant it is to the conversation. It is just two guys who think they are hilariously funny, sitting, eating, driving, and talking nonsense that only they would possibly care for, or maybe they even do not.For some reason they think they can do the best impressions of male actors. The whole movie is just about who can impersonate Michael Caine better.Finally, there is a third movie coming out this year, which I am assuming is exactly the same, but in a new country. So, consider this a review of that as well because I do not think they would do anything new except throwing in some Spanish words every now and then.Boring, boring, booooooooring."
" If You Liked the First, You'll Like This One as Well
",0.7506,0.9969,2017-09-08 00:00:00,7,"The Trip to Italy is a sequel to the little known, little seen 2010 film The Trip, which in itself is a highlight reel of a little known, little seen BBC miniseries of the same name. Each reiteration of this franchise, I guess you could call it, feels like the rotating lenses of a microscope, filling in more detail while getting ever smaller in scope and appeal. Who exactly is this movie for? I'm not quite sure but whoever is on its wavelength will probably have a ball.The Trip to Italy revisits Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as they are once again conscripted by the London Observer to eat at and review multiple restaurants. This time instead of driving through the foggy moors of Northern England, the duo drive their rented Mini Cooper through the sunny coasts of Italy. While doing so they once again trade witty repartee, relight professional rivalries and whip out their best Michael Caine impressions.Its basically the same setup as the first only the location and power dynamic between our two leads is a bit more interesting. Coogan's star seems to have taken a dip since the cancellation of his American TV series. Meanwhile the less misanthropic Brydon is being courted by director Michael Mann for a billed part in a crime drama. Insecurities and the specter of aging into obsolescence abounds in this sequel, and the Italian countryside and tales of the Romantics serve beautifully as a stark juxtaposition.Director Michael Winterbottom takes every opportunity to indulge in the sun and scenic poetry of Italy. As the characters retrace the steps of the romantics, Winterbottom takes delight in lifting visual cues from mainstay international cinema such as the bumpy road trips of Il Sorpasso (1962), the luxurious schooners of Purple Noon (1960) and the general feeling of ennui from La Dolce Vita (1960). As the film wears on, the actors become entrenched in a background literally alive with history, unable to make their pithy comments take you out of the beauty (though it's not for lack of trying.Yet the same things that bogged down The Trip from being the best version of itself are still purposely present in Trip to Italy. There are the same insufferably self-centered characters, the same conversations and improvisational impressions, the same inattention to the freaking food! Seriously, I realize that oafish behavior set against the truly beautiful is partially the point but how do you NOT make Italian food the center of attention? Thankfully the two surly actors have much more to interact with. Actresses Marta Barrio and Rosie Fellner actually show up to dinner instead of being relegated to bits of cellphone asides. Steve's son (as played by Timothy Leach) shows up as well allowing us to see how two middle-aged men in a perpetual existential crises handle being around a child for a few minutes.Overall Trip to Italy is in my mind a smidgen better than its predecessor and only because it trades temperate gloom for Mediterranean sunniness. But if you're the type who finds the fields, fog and verdant bluffs of England more appealing then the opposite might be true for you. Regardless, your ability to take this trilogy (so far) is wholly dependent on your ability to stomach two actors winging-it while sitting across from one another. I personally found my patience eroding by the minute."
" I Was Expecting A Travelogue
",0.0,0.583,2017-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Two British television stars take a drive through Italy for a magazine article, and one of them gets the chance to have a major role in an American movie about the mob. Presumably this is all fiction, because it did originally seem to be a straight travelogue...until you hear how weird the initial conversation gets. You see fancy meals being prepared and eaten, the pair going to posh hotels, pictures of beautiful scenery, many references to Byron, Shelley, and other writers of that era...and then you realize the locations of the hotels and restaurants in the movie are never identified.There is no real plot to the movie, which has a lot of chatter between the two leads, as well as their (fictional?) families. And much of that involves impersonations of various British actors. Mildly entertaining, but the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts."
" Why?
",0.0,0.7156,2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"Imagine you're stuck on a trip with two guys who WON'T EVER SHUT UP. Even worse, they consider themselves really funny, witty, clever. That's the plot. Nothing more. Just two guys ad libbing for the camera. Steve Coogan is, I guess, a big deal in the UK so evidently a movie with him rambling for a couple hours is British gold - but there's just nothing funny about him."
" I guess you have to be British to appreciate the banters between these two guys
",0.4019,-0.7405,2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"I suppose this movie isn't for me, as I already find Rob Brydon quite obnoxious during the first ten minutes of this movie. I have given this film a 3 out of 10 due to the filming locations (Italy). People tend to overrate a lot of the British movies, and unfortunately this is one of them. I don't particularly appreciate this so called witty banters between these two characters/actors/comedians, and they might have thought they had mocked Michael Cain successfully by doing impressions of him. Impersonating another person isn't only about trying to mimic that person's accent and voice. Their impressions of Robert De Niro were a failure while they were dining with two other British women at a restaurant in Rome. It was interesting to see what kind of food they were eating. So if you are into British humor and want to watch a movie in which these two are either eating or driving around Italy, this is for you."
" Another pleasant ""Trip"" even though the novelty's worn off
",0.2732,0.9938,2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are on the road again with director Michael Winterbottom, this time in Italy. There's not much else to say about the plot of ""The Trip to Italy"" unless you're unfamiliar with 2010's ""The Trip,"" in which case go watch that movie first. Not because you need to know information about the first, but you need to know where the whole shtick is coming from.""Trip to Italy"" is more impersonations, more gorgeous scenery (the Amalfi Coast, seriously ), more plated food, more phone calls to loved ones back home, more poetry, more everything from the northern England ""trip."" It's a formula that worked the first time because of the wild improvisational talents of its leads but also the way they stay grounded. By and large it works here, only the novelty has worn off a bit.Story-wise, Winterbottom has flipped the script in a couple subtle but key ways, starting with Rob calling Steve to invite him to Italy as he's become the food writer now, or at least equal with Steve. This is the first of many role-reversals in store for the fictional versions of Rob and Steve, whose lives have clearly changed since the last trip. Although these persona narratives are shifting, they're still as goofy, chummy, career-focused and fixated on their age and legacies as ever.Mortality is a particular focus of conversation. Aging, their sex appeal, what they might still accomplish before their deaths – their time in Vesuvius, for example, leaves them ""petrified"" as Rob jokes. Winterbottom definitely steers the dialogue in this direction more purposefully than last time, but Steve and Rob keep it lighthearted and enjoyable while still allowing for some salient ideas to emerge.The comedy stays the course as well, with a number of callbacks to jokes from the first film including brief Michael Caine bits and James Bond impressions. In most comedy sequels, that would be annoying, cheap and a sign of a terrible cash-grabbing middle finger to the audience who deserves some original material. But ""The Trip"" resembled a real-life road trip and when two friends go on a second trip together, they often recall the jokes that gave them a laugh and good memories the last time.We do get some new impersonations and quite a bit of Alanis Morrisette karaoke, the least fitting backdrop for a tour of Italia as you could ever imagine. The laugh-out-loud moments get a bit scarcer and the impersonations a bit more grating – though in fairness I did watch ""The Trip"" very recently so those who've taken a longer hiatus won't likely feel the same.""The Trip to Italy"" loses a bit of comic luster as sequels tend to do, but the feeling of being on a road trip vacation that made ""The Trip"" so pleasant washes over you yet again. The ending leaves a bit to be desired but on the whole it's a satisfying continuation of the antics and style that fans of ""The Trip"" effortlessly enjoyed.~Steven CThanks for reading.
