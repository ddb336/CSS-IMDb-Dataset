" Could have been better.. much better!!
",0.5399,0.6597,2021-04-07 00:00:00,6,Started out noice .. had it's moments ..the finale could have been better. A few snapshots with the credits would have worked for me. Nevertheless it was a decent flick.
" Great concept, weak execution
",0.296,0.9193,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Joss Whedon wrote this as one of his first screenplays in the 90s and it shows.The concept of 2 people connecting by a sensory connection is a novel and (as far as I can tell), a pretty unique idea. The problem is the branching storylines of the supporting characters in both Dylan and Rebecca's lives are underdeveloped and take time away from the 2 main characters building their relationship. Whedon's ballooning screenplay, while coming from a very creative and imaginative origin, ends up using contrivances and clichés to resolve the main storyline as well as the bloated side bits.The real shame is that Zoe Kazan and Michael Stahl-David both acted the hell out of their roles. The characters are very real and very likeable. I just wish that they got a second and third act that was worthy of their efforts."
" The Feelings are Still Here!
",0.0,0.9667,2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,"This is an amazing, lovely and underrated movie. I'm sad that most people don't know this. The acting is great, both of the main characters. They feel real and makes me really want them to be together. Not like some other awkward films. The feelings I got during and after watching this movie are still here. Love, joy, fun and sadness.
Trust me, don't miss this. You will feel ""LOVE"" again after watching this."
" A romantic gem, that won't get any sort of recognition.
",0.4019,0.9765,2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"In Your Eyes is a wonderful film, assuming you can look past the initial premise.It's about connecting with someone or being interconnected, sharing experiences and being lifted out of the daily doldrums of ones own life in caring about another's. Exceptionally written, with likable characters and realistic encounters despite the fantasy premise, like Dylan's first conversation with Donna. No surprise Joss Whedon wrote it, nobody writes better characters and dialogue. Zoe Kazan's splendid, Stahl-David almost equally talented, good secondary performances as well. Accompanied by a quality soundtrack."
" Interesting concept, awful execution
",-0.0772,-0.0516,2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"This is the last straw, I'm done with reviews on this site - there are too many fake ones. I know, what an irony writing a review saying that. Anyway, the premise is fascinating, unfortunately, with a very bland result. Everything from acting to cinematography is lacking. Shame, it could have been a great movie."
" A romantic gem
",0.4019,0.9747,2020-01-30 00:00:00,8,"A very beautiful romantic story, based on a clever idea that gives rise to the thought of ""what if"". It travels pleasantly, despite the directorial weaknesses, but it balances on many points capturing the emotion and magnetizing. Excellent support of the script by Zoe Kazan, who seems to be experiencing both her role and her leading-role partner. The film is backed by an excellent soundtrack, with a careful selection of songs that act as breaks between the - superficial - relationship of the two leadings."
" In Your Eyes Needed More Vision.
",0.3167,0.8549,2019-08-10 00:00:00,6,"With a rushed ending that doesn't satisfactorily conclude at all, In Your Eyes broke apart at its finish, a finish that was preceded by a middle that felt too drawn out and stuck in illustrating a somewhat non-evolving narrative, which was a main cause to why the ending was so, scattered, abandoned and requisite.This movie starts off quite well, but, it makes no attempt at trying to figure itself out. For one, neither Rebecca or Dylan ever asked themselves or each other, how what was happening to them was happening, and what it was that was happening and has been happening to them.It relied too heavily on exposition, forcing itself into a situation where it only had a one dimensional story to tell, and that is why its middle felt drawn out, to a point where if this movie was 10 minutes longer, it would've risked effectuating boredom.In Your Eyes is a sweet movie, but it had the potential to be that and more. Zoe Kazan is adorable and perhaps the best part of the movie, though her character could've done with being a bit more rounded.In the end however, though In Your Eyes is very watchable, with quite a few enjoyable moments, the ending was this movie's undoing, while it was steadily losing ground from start to finish. 6/10."
" Awesome start, dull later
",0.34,0.9547,2019-08-03 00:00:00,7,"I like Joss Whedons creation like Buffy the vampire Slayer or Avengers or Firefly, and yes, this too had a great potential. I liked the drama, the theme of two differently located people could inter connect, like through telepathy, and that did gave me reason to keep watching. Zoe's acting and presence was great and so was Michael's likeable. However as we moved towards the later part of movie, it seemed to me the same old way of two love birds trying out things. That actually dint did well, i was thinking of something more interesting.Anyways, not more than 7 stars from me. However, i will do like to watch movies like this but with something more refreshing from start till end."
" Very good movie
",0.4927,0.128,2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,I think it's a good film as it has a new idea espically the dialouge between two person in different region without any physical communication..it's crazy
" I wonder how they got this idea for the movie
",0.0,0.9802,2019-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I wonder how Joss got this idea from the movie, because this happened to me, this is true story.I've met this person which happened to be from the opposite sex, like in the movie and discovered that we've met before as kids just one time in our lives, the same memory we shared and it was so strong that we could not forget. I was picking a planted flower for no particular reason and she was doing the same. I was around 3 or 4 years old, she was 9. We looked at each other and move on, but I felt some comunication in her eyes and remembered that. It was the same for her. After 18 years we've met again.
We could feel each other presence from great distance and could comunicate without words.
It was so powerful, that it scared us, but fascinated us in the same time. I was staying in another town, around 200km distance and could comunicate very good. We tried to avoid looking in eachother eyes because it was painfull and scary, but we did once and blowed my mind because it was like seeing her life and soul in seconds.
We are not toghether right now and I think it's best this way, it was too much for us. I felt like going insane from it, I didn't know what to think, I started to doubt many things, it was nuts.Man, this story is real! Strange things exists in the world and we know so little about these. Is difficult to speak about it, people think you're crazy. You have to feel it on your own, than you are kinda forced to accept it.Enyone else experienced this ? If yes, please share it! Thanks!"
" It was an okay movie
",0.2263,0.8124,2018-10-26 00:00:00,7,"The concept was really good, two strangers connected by a special bond. But the delivery was unsatisfactory in my opinion. The plot was strong enough and a cliched ending."
" Not perfect but a pleasure to watch
",-0.7181,0.9983,2018-08-10 00:00:00,9,"When The Avengers came out in 2012, I was very surprised about how good it was and kept wondering why Joss Whedon was able to create such an awesome superhero movie. This film is one of the reasons why.The film centrals around Dylan and Rebecca, two people from very different backgrounds. Rebecca is the wife of Phillip- a very successful doctor and her life revolves around going to boring parties with her husband. Dylan is an ex-con who now works as a car wash. Their lives have a dramatic change when they realised they can see and experience each others' feelings despite being miles away from each other.The best part of this film is how well director Brian Hill juggles the transitions between the two characters. It never felt out of place or hard to catch up with, it was executed smoothly. I also love how each charcters' life is potrayed. They have their own problems and their connection doesn't make life any easier, in fact, it makes them struggled more than they have ever been. The fact that how different their worlds are along with Zoe Kazan and Michael Stahl-David's brilliant chemistry just make the duo very likeable and we can actually feel for them.The film's plot is pretty straight-forward and doesn't have any crazy plot twists, but it did a really great job building the characters and their relationships. This is something Joss has done before in The Avengers where the film centralised on characters and use them to tell the story instead of over-complicating it. Its a perfect plot as this is just a simple romance-comedy film. Not to mention the very open ending. To me the ending was great and it's best to leave things ambiguous because if it were the same old happily ever after then this film wouldn't be that good anymore.The film definitely has some problems as well. I found the major issue to be how Becky and Dylan first found out they were connected. The scene while hilarious, felt kind of fast and sloppy. I mean, if I knew there are voices in my head I would try to get rid of it ASAP because that's just scary.All in all, In Your Eyes was a great film with a perfect balance between romance and fantasy. It's not without flaws, but what more can you ask for. I would definitely recommend it to viewers who just want a good time or couples, especially if they are currently far apart. Very excited to see more from Joss Whedon."
" Absolute Feel-Good Fantasy.
",0.0,0.9894,2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,"What a surprise gem this turned out to be! It's very rare for every aspect of a movie to happen exactly the way I want it to - there are usually things I wish they'd done differently - but with this one I wouldn't change a thing. It left me feeling utterly satisfied, happy, and somewhat in love with the two lead actors!The whole film hinges on the exquisite chemistry between the two main characters, who don't share any screen time until the final few minutes. And they pull it off beautifully. It is one of the most romantic films I've seen, yet manages to avoid any schmaltz or sentimentality. It's just honest, natural, and tender - quite an achievement considering that the engine driving the narrative is basically supernatural phenomena! I stumbled across this movie quite by accident, and I'm very glad I did."
" Nothing unexpected
",0.0,-0.5684,2018-04-02 00:00:00,6,"I tend not to watch Romantic movies only because they are so terribly formulated that you can work out what is going to happen before it happens. This movie wasn't any different. The setting was kind of a cool but I didn't connect very well with the characters. A lot of it felt forced, like the controlling husband situation. It wasn't the worst romantic movie to watch with your lady."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.816,2017-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Writer, director and actors combine to make a life-like experience of two cognitively connected individuals. That it receives anything less than a 10 star rating is more telling of the reviewers then the movie itself. Don't love chicks flicks, but damn this is one fantastic one. It's so good I have to check it out on IMDb to see who the director and writer are; I must know. I prefer it over Titanic; more feeling, more life-like. Where Titanic focuses on the story, In Your Eyes focuses on the emotionally journey."
" Just a fantastic sweet film with incredible performances
",0.765,0.991,2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Dylan is a dysfunctional low-level ex-con who in his own words has 'Disappointed everyone he ever knew.' Rebecca is a bored housewife whose life within the upper echelons of the Hampshire upper-class set is as dull as it is loveless. Married to a Doctor who already has doubts about his wife's sanity she finds a stronger connection with the person's life she can see across the country. Dylan, his life bordering on a return to crime, finds a welcome distraction in being connected to Rebecca. Both can see and hear what the other thinks and does and have in fact been connected since an accident from childhood. Will this connection prove to be their undoing or a gateway to a more soulful connection in life that both are lacking? I was recommended this film by a friend of mine and having never even heard of it before I just decided to give it a stab. Joss Whedon has woven a beautiful LOVE story with a Science Fiction element which will not make it unrelatable to a modern audience. We watch as these two people from different ends of the spectrum of society are drawn together by sharing their thoughts and feelings, not so much different as two strangers who meet on the internet (Relatable, right?) It really is such a sweet and cleverly crafted film, but the thing that makes it work is the outstanding performances of the two leads. Zoe Kazan gives a great performance as Rebecca torn between the duty to her husband and her growing feelings for the man she has never met. But it is Michael Stahl- David who is just incredible. This is an actor who is just so natural in every performance he gives and this is one of his earlier outings. He brings a sensitivity to his role rarely seen in so many similar performances giving his character layers that other weaker performers would have been unable to achieve. I predict an Oscar for his man is not very far away and I am sure we have not seen the best of him yet. Good performances are given from the supporting cast too. The film is not entirely flawless and has perhaps one music montage too many but otherwise, this is a well crafted solid film that asks for our sympathy for the characters and you would have to be an extremely hard-hearted cynic not to give it. My congratulations to everyone involved. I am already promoting this film on my social media, urging others to watch it. I loved it (But you got that right?)"
" Wanted to like it more
",0.3612,0.6652,2017-09-19 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this. I liked the premise of two unconnected people from different parts of the country having a telepathic connection. I was also excited to see it was written by Joss Whedon. I just didn't think the movie delivered.It could have done so much more with the telepathic connection. Instead what we get is an awful lot of telepathic chatting, which from the viewer's viewpoint is no different than watching two characters talking on the phone.The leads are likable enough, even though the characters are really not. Especially Becky, who keeps talking and acting as if she is sincerely trying to keep her marriage together, when she is obviously not. Maybe she is trying to convince herself. Either that or inconsistency in either writing or editing. I know I didn't believe her.It's not bad, but just a rather standard fare rom-com, when it could have been more."
" I simply love this film.
",0.6369,0.9898,2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved this movie. I turned it on with exactly zero expectations and was thoroughly wowed. The story line is simple enough, but the acting is superb; especially so as the main characters only have one scene together. The facial and physical reactions to each other are subtle, full of nuance and evoked so much pathos I found it fairly staggering. There were moments I laughed out load during the movie, but it is definitely not a rom-com. Nor a dramedy either. It is essentially a drama which deals with love and mental health in a very unique, light and unusual way. If you in anyway enjoy a romantic movie which is full of quirks; I'm talking 'Safety Not Guaranteed', 'Her', 'Non-transferable', then you will probably fall head over heals with this little gem!"
" Loved this movie!!
",0.6688,0.923,2017-07-08 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved this movie.... the premise is unique, the acting and chemistry between the main characters is amazing, and the directing / music / editing contributed to an experience which turned me into emotional mush. This movie would have been a 10 out of 10 for me, except for the last half hour where the plot ran away into silly land.This is a movie I will happily watch again and again."
" It's worth watching
",0.2263,0.9744,2017-07-06 00:00:00,10,"I have never written a review of a movie that I watched, but this movie is absolutely awesome. The film is about a beautiful love, or I myself think that. Their soul is in sync, and above all they have experienced the pain together, in the past and present. And from this movie, i think it's still important to make soul-contact before something else-contact, that's my definition of love."
" A touching fantastical romance.
",0.765,0.9178,2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"This is a well-done movie. It tells a thoroughly fantastical love story created by a psychic connection between two random people, one a bored married woman in the snowy Northeast and one a dysfunctional man in New Mexico. The movie ends much in the way that you would expect of a film of this genre to, but the psychic connection elements allows the movie to subvert the clichés of forbidden love and love-at-first-sight to create a story that is both original and classic.(I saw this on March 12, 2017.)"
" An underwhelming piece of dribble
",0.0,0.8793,2017-06-17 00:00:00,3,"I watched this film off the back of its strong premise and the promise of a decent acting performance from the usually brilliant Zoe Kazan. I suppose I'll preface my review by saying that I was disappointed, as the film seemed totally unable to stick to any genre it supposedly was. Initially pitched as a sci-fi/ romance, the film dwindled into a pudgy mess of awkward dialogue, ill-fitting score and incredibly unlikable and unrelatable characters. Whilst the plot seemed a unique take on the generally overplayed star-crossed lovers theme it didn't take me long to figure out that this was just another chick-flick full of comedically bad villains the likes of; the nosy housewife who couldn't paint, or, the women who liked her steaks well done. The most heinous of all villains was of course Phillip the husband, whilst not being wholly neglectful in his marriage, was just so unrealistically dickish that at times I did think Rebecca, played by Kazan, should run away with the random voice in her head. Perhaps this was supposed to infer some underlying theme regarding domestic abuse, but in all honesty the worst thing he actually did apart from being a jerk all the time was stop her from refilling her wine glass at that boring function.The old 'troubled intellectual' / 'Good Will Hunting' trope also made an appearance through Dylan's character, played by Michael Stahl-David, which might just have worked in making him a likable character if not for his continuous stupidity. It was particularly grating when the film tried to introduce the idea of his intellect through dry wit and the word ""benign"" when chatting with a woman at the bar... I mean clearly he's to good for this town if he knows such a big word. But overall I just found the film a hard pill to swallow as I cringed through nearly every interaction.If you must watch this film, or you have already watched it and are trawling through the reviews for some explanation as to why you just sat through such a ""benign"" piece of trash, may I recommend a nearly identical yet vastly superior film ""The F word"" (""What If"" in the U.S) also starring Zoe Kazan but without the psychic element or the terrible, terrible.... everything else."
" A Truly Original and Epic Love Story
",0.8555,0.991,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I am a sucker for romance and this one really just blew me away. I knew it would be good but I didn't expect it to tug at my heart strings this much. It is a truly dazzling movie with amazing acting, especially from the female lead. I immediately googled everything else she has ever been in immediately following this movie.I didn't find the plot hard to follow at all and I was really holding my breath at times, the dialogue and the connection between the two characters is just so beautiful. I also find anything where mental illness is involved to be very intriguing.The only reason I am not giving it a perfect score is because I really wish she hadn't actually been married, I think it would have been less messy if that controlling dude was just her long time boyfriend or fiancée. It complicated matters that he was her husband, especially with that rushed ending. I suppose the only point is that they end up together and I definitely shed tears of joy when they finally embraced, but ""disappearing into Canada"" was a little too easy of an ending for me and not very believable. In this day and age it is nearly impossible to just drop off the grid like that, especially when one of you is married and neither of you even have any money.But regardless of the rushed ending, it is a truly spectacular movie. I found the plot to be very fascinating and original. The emotions of the characters ran deep with me. Would definitely watch again.P.S. Watch closely, one of the angry thugs from the bar is Simon from 7th Heaven! Totally unrecognizable!"
" Refreshing, Clever and Exceedingly Charming
",0.7783,0.9983,2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"It's dangerous to hype a movie in a review while not tainting the reader's perspective and set expectations too high. A perfect example for me as a movie goer was My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Everyone claimed it was so fantastic that when I finally got to see it, I really had to ask myself what the hype was about.So, that is my quandary in talking about this little film that nobody seems to have seen but should have. I saw the film listed on a blog of sleeper films still available on Netflix (and it's on Amazon, too). The short trailer definitely piqued my interest with its unique premise and unmistakable charm. The film stars Zoe Kazan and Michael Stahl-David - two actors I had not seen on screen before. Written by Joss Whedon and directed by Brin Hill the film tells the story of two people connected in a seemingly supernatural way. Becky (Kazan) and Dylan (Stahl-David) suddenly discover that they can experience each others senses yet they've never met and are practically on opposite sides of the country from one another.The fact that the unique premise of the film comes from the delightfully talented Whedon was no surprise to me at all. While Whedon is mostly known for the man behind cult hits like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly, his great body of writing work include monster hits like the Avengers, the tremendously clever The Cabin in the Woods and now this remarkably charming gem.Brin Hill's directing credits are not nearly as well known as Whedon's but she takes his incredibly unique and simple story and gives it elegant life. She takes the concept of two minds connected in an inexplicable way and makes it not only plausible but exceptionally real. The two leads fantastically bring their characters to life and the chemistry between them is truly palpable despite the fact that they rarely share the screen at the same time.The plot takes a little bit to get moving but if you can muster through the opening minutes that paint the background for these characters, in just the next few moments they will connect with you and not let go. There are warm laughs, witty dialogue, quirky awkwardness and even tension as the story unfolds before you. It's uncommon tale is woven together brilliantly capturing the passion, complexity and beauty of Becky and Dylan's unexpected and unimaginable romance.In a Hollywood landscape filled with remakes, big budget blunders, overly sexed and violent films - In Your Eyes brings back the elegance of storytelling that is so rare today. This is an exceedingly charming film that is sure to both entertain and delight."
" take a...
",0.0,0.9673,2017-03-21 00:00:00,9,"...bottle of wine and spend 2 hours with this movie. Excellent combination 😊 you will either love it or take it as a soapy opera. your choice. it's a nice love story, better than one expects. maybe the wine is kicking, but i can tell that you will follow both the wine and the action. just keep a clear mind, don't expect that the movie will be more than a dream, and you are all set up to have the next two days happy that you have spent two hours of your life watching this movie."
" Naive movie ignoring real people with mental illness exists
",-0.7579,-0.9969,2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"It's a classic naive American romcom. From the beginning, you know which two characters are going to kiss in the final scene. But if you put that aside it's watchable. You just need to lean back and enjoy the romantic part and not think about it too much... Or should you?The reason I gave this two stars is because I had to think about it the day after I watched it, having it recommended by a friend.What I couldn't understand was why the two protagonists, who are telepathically linked, are not pretending they are on a phone, when they speak to each other in public. Instead, they let people around them believe they are mentally ill.Which raises a lot of questions. In the movie, you hear ideas about what is actually happening to them: ""going crazy"", ""having voices in their head"", ""schizophrenia""... Yet they never try to understand it nor seek professional help. They just go on with their lives in denial until they get to communicate with each other and from that point they start believing the person in their head is real.The problem is, many people suffering from mental illness have difficulties admitting their brain is not always providing them with reliable perception of reality. They may refuse to seek help. They may be scared of mental institutions, afraid they would be given medication which would just turn them into a mindless body. This is only ""confirmed"" by the movie.Thinking about it, it does not look like they have a telepathic connection at all. It looks like they have a mental illness. They cannot control it all the time. They act like they don't realize how strange they look talking to someone nobody else can see or hear. He even experiences something looking like seizure. She repeatedly ""embarrasses"" her husband at important (for him) meetings while experiencing something like a panic attack.All is topped by her husband being a doctor who never tries to help her and behaves like an insensitive and ignorant egoist (like he never studied medicine so he could help people), judging her for her suffering. Later, he has her locked up in mental institution only when he suspects she might be having an affair. Seriously!In the end the two protagonists finally meet. Like that wouldn't be the first thing on your mind to confirm that you are not actually loosing your sanity.They meet and they know the other is real at that point. Now, think about it for a moment. There are real people in the real world suffering because they hear voices in their head a you just take their suffering and turn it into romantic comedy? These people will never find out the voice is their head is actually their destined love. They will always have to live like this knowing that there is something wrong with them. It will never be a happy ending for them!It makes me really angry that such a disrespectful movie exits. That so many people worked on it and no one pointed out how immoral it is.It can never be stressed out too much how important it is to talk about mental health."
