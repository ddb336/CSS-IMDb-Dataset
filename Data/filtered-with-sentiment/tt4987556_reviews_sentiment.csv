Except one logical point made in the beginning of the movie and Arvind Swamy's rendition of the antagonist, everything in the movie is excruciatingly disappointing - the screenplay, acting, background score, action sequences, etc.
Avoid."

Brief Review -Acceptable to be called the Best Cop Drama recently but only if you can overlook multiple Functional loopes. Thani Oruvan is deserving acclaimed cop drama as fas as mainstream filmmaking is concerned but if you really want to look after quality and sensibility then this one is trapped badly while trying to look extra smart. You see some films try to be over smart and then in the same process they leave many loope holes behind which have lost the basic sense. Thani Oruvan is about an honest cop who has only one Mission in his life and that is of course to destroy crime sections. The officer decides to take on the king so that puppets would go off silently and his mission will be accomplished. But we call antagonist the King for a reason, of course he is one step ahead of protagonist and so as expected he loses his control and anger (so cheap and outdated it was). While making this one look advanced cop film i mean adding some technical advances, gadgets, devices etc. Thani Oruvan really looks lavish and innovative but only to lose the basic sense after some time. See, a cop is being traced but only when director wish to show the scene otherwise he's doing everything fine without being traced. I mean what the hell? If a person is being traced 24x7 then all his activities must be traced by so called genius antagonist, right? But that doesn't seems like scene here and like I said there are lots of functional theories and loop holes in the film which you have to overlook to enjoy this cat and mouse fight. But come on, when you see a film having IMDb rating almost at 8.5/10, you can't just accept so many loopes, so it's better to call it Highly overrated in that sense. Otherwise, as a mainstream cop drama this one is a fantastic film by margin. If you've had enough of hard-core hero vs Villain face offs then this one is somewhat intelligent and Advanced to be preferred over other cop dramas. Thani Ovuran is lifted by technical support otherwise it is so typical. That unnecessary Romance, useless backdrop of villian, typical climax and trying to have something intentional in the name of patriotism is just so not cool. I don't see any logic in the writing when you destroy your own fine and solid character childishly without even thinking of where did you begin it, on what level you introduced him and what are you doing to him now for no strong reasons. The acting, cinematography, background score, action, direction everything is upto the fine line but nothing goes beyond. Overall, a Nice film and recommendable but not as a Classic.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"

" Arvind Swami Show Stealer.
",-0.4019,0.9757,2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Movies is average but the tricks keep you engage from start to end full marks to writing team. Jayram Ravi is OK...Nayanthara Played well her short but important part...but the shows Topper is Arvind Swami.. the cool antagonist who played the game by mind. He is cool yet very vicious yet very funny infact in some part he's charm will make you to want him to win & not the protagonist.
Overall its Arvind Swami performance that makes me to intrigue through out the movie."

",0.6249,0.9547,2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,"#ThaniOruvan - Good Vs Bad. A story with a very different dimension.This movie was clearly shown that how actually a person controls the entire government with his mastermind. Both the lead characters Siddharth and Mithran designed well. Their characters had an equal level of weightage. This film made a comeback for everyone of them. All artists and technicians gave a great contribution for this movie. Standing ovation to everyone!!It was a very great action thriller. So, please watch it without reading the story, if it is first time.Anyone from Hollywood can do this film as a remake!
It's a very challenged script.. I'm sure!"

" Average film
",0.0,0.9829,2018-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Currently rated 8.6 on IMDB , just too much. Votes from local audience might be the reason. It's strictly okay film.Overall story is good but first 25 minutes are just too fast. So many things happen in just no time and we have seen them all before. The film becomes grippy from the scene where Mithran shows his research to his friends. But whenever story starts holding, there comes some inspirational and jingoistic dialogue.The director is not shy of using almost every possible existing cliche . Whether it is the unnecessary love story or the over patriotic characters . The cat and mouse game was among the best but at times the focus shifts away from it.I have heard from many that Arvind swamy has given a lifetime performance in this movie but for me, it looks like he has no role other than smiling and looks almost same in every frame .And Jayam Ravi looks too serious and didn't even change his expression in the 1st half .Although, it's good but not worthy of 8.6."
" This is how you write a Screenplay!
",0.0,0.9959,2018-06-22 00:00:00,10,"Pros:
1) Flawless Screenplay! No Loopholes, No unnecessary romance, No dedicated comedy scenes etc. Everything is packaged tightly. The facts are also well-researched.
2) Role Selection - For action thrillers such as this, the characters will make or break a movie. Thankfully, all the actors fit their roles nicely. Even heroine's role is not wasted.
3) Arvind Swamy - This man is a revelation! From a chocolate boy to a Menacing Villain, his transformation is Extraordinary!
4) Villain's role - For any action movies, the villains need to be stronger and smarter than the hero so that audience will be engaged. THIS MOVIE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE ON HOW VILLAIN ROLES SHOULD BE WRITTEN! A villain does not need to look terrifying, no need to have six packs, no need to have fighting skills, does not have to shout at everyone around him etc. He just needs to have an evil mindset and does not stop at anything to achieve his dreams. An interesting thing in this movie is that there are no fight scenes between the hero and villain and the villain does not even utter a single cuss word. Heck he won't even raise his voice to the hero. But yet, he is the greatest evil. In the villain's own words - ""I'm not bad, just evil"" (Telugu cinema should learn to improve their villain roles from this movie)
5) Hip Hop Tamizha - This young chap is the GREATEST ASSET of this movie! Right from the BGM, the songs and the movie's theme ""Theemai dhaan vellum"", he has further elevated this movie to a different level. His BGM everytime Arvind Swamy appears on screen is worth special mention. The usage of the theme song as BGM for the interval and climax scenes is a MasterTouch! He deserved a National Award for this movie.
6) Nayanthara - Unlike typical heroines, Nayanthara's role is rather important and she provides some of the comic relief in this movie. 
7) Thambi Ramaiah - This is his best role since Myna. As a naive father to the world's greatest villain, his counter-punch and the way he shivers infront of his own son are praiseworthy. Cons:
1) NONEThis is one of the best Tamil movies ever made. Actually scratch that, this is one the BEST INDIAN MOVIE ever! A case study on how cop thrillers should be made, how villain roles should be written, how a BGM should sound like and how to include Mass elements without going over the top. DO NOT MISS IT!"

",0.0,0.8553,2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,The film was very good with many messages. Arvind Swamy rocks in the film with his stylish acting. Jayam Ravi also acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM was superb in the film.
" One very good movie where the villain stands above the hero
",0.4927,0.7351,2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Excellently scripted by Raja, and well enacted by Ravi, Arvind Swamy and others. Right from the first scene, the director makes you think."
" Racy, sleek, and thrilling, Thani Oruvan features a stellar performance from Arvind Swamy and is Politically astute
",0.4767,0.993,2018-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Finally we have an original screenplay and idea from Mohan Raja, and a great one at that. Thani oruvan narrates the story of Mithran, a cop who becomes obsessed with bringing down India's most corrupt businessman, Sidharth Abhimanyu and displays the psychological cat and mouse game that enfolds. Although its presented as usual in the good versus evil form the underlying political core of this film was very intriguing: The invisble but ever looming connection between seemingly small street crimes, media, politicians and businessmen. Here, M.Raja explores the decaying corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. The pace of the film is very fast paced, and rarely lags, constantly putting the audience into situation after situation where we see the psychological battle between Mithran and Sidharth Abhimanyu play out, with building tension, suspense and sudden twists. The opening scene of the film itself is very unique and establishes an unexpected character in the film.Likewise the film builds to an unexpected but impactful climax. Yes, sometimes the film becomes preachy, with Jayam Ravi giving passionate monologues, however this doesn't take away too much from the film. The dialogues in general are very crisp and striking. The charachterisation in this film is mostly good. Whereas Sidharth Abhimanyu is a trendsetting villain who will undoubtedly go down as one of the most badass villains in tamil cinema, the same cannot be said of Mithran's character. Mithran's character is slightly more fleshed out than other cliched Do gooder heroes of Kollywood. We see glimpses of his obsession to bring down Sidharth Abhimanyu, particularly in an intense scene where he almost destroys his own apartment searching for a bug. However this obsession could have been more fleshed out to the extent that Mithran himself ends up making morally questionable decisions to arrest his personally assigned enemy. Jayam Ravi's performance is good but lies in the shadow of Arvind Swamy's understated and badass performance as Sidharth Abhimanyu, a ruthless, calculating, manipulative and opportunistic businessman. The supporting cast are also good and help to progress the narrative. Especially Rahul Madhav as Jana, Nasser as the chief minister and Thambi Ramaiah are very good. Nayanthara isnt a cliched heroine just there for commercial purposes. Although her role is more commercial (as usual a duet but at least only one) at least her character had a role and was more integrated into the story, and her performance was good so the romance portion wasn't too irritating or irrelevant.Hip Hop Tamizha's music is very good, the songs are catchy and memorable and the bgm is excellent, especially Theemai dhan vellum and ""Thani Oruvan"" both themes are brilliant and emit expected vibes; Dark and badass, and Awesome in a motivating way. Technically the film is sound. The editing is great and so is the cinematography especially with the colour tones and shades.Overall, Thani oruvan is a film one can watch many times and is racy, sleek and thrilling, featuring a stellar comeback from Arvind Swamy as well as politically astute themes,"

" Highly Overrated
",0.0,-0.8015,2017-09-06 00:00:00,2,I don't know why this film is rated 8.6. This is a highly overrated Tamil film. The film lags from the beginning till the end. The film is full of unnecessary dialogues and scenes. Sometimes the film is so boring that you feel asleep. Never watch this movie. It is a time wasting movie.
" This movie is one such rare gem in Tamil Cinema that it will be always remain eternal for its theme, making and presentation on screen with class and style.
",0.0,0.9322,2017-07-05 00:00:00,9,"For a long time, Tamil Cinema wanted to see an Antagonist who is brainy rather than being brawny since the villain roles have become very much clich√©d in the movies where the antagonist would be there just make sure the protagonist is shown and lauded as Hero for his daredevilry.Thani Oruvan (2015) directed by M.Raja with story from Subha brought a new and promising premise of battle between Good and Bad where the Villain would Act and the Hero would react. This movie was a career defining movie for Jayam Ravi playing Mithran IPS ( one of his best character roles in recent years ) and mainly Arvind Swamy who aced the role of Siddarth Abhimanyu just icing the character on the screen with panache and charisma who finally ended up being the show stealer on the movie.The title justifies the Protagonist and Antagonist as a Single Person who traverse on different paths for which seems to be the right one for them and they do succeed on the same with their own thought process paving the way for the same.Like they say a Great Hero needs a Greater Villain, here the same was followed and succeeded. The intensity in Mithran's character is the exact balance of the moral anger inside him and his anxiety to snitch his most prized target ;Siddarth Abhimanyu.The movie when seen from a Social Angle depicts that all small crimes and antisocial acts are just a fitting piece of puzzle in a bigger picture which is completely blindfolded by the Megalomaniacs and Corporate Giants from the eyes of common man. The movie emphasized on how the minor and major events are interlinked and relatively affecting the lives of the common public without disrupting their daily lives.Coming to the movie, the movie's success is a complete Teamwork from all ends. The most important factor was the Character Design and Depiction on screen which hit the ball out of the park. Siddharth Abhimanyu's character is always cool, never loses his calm and temper, never shouts lines in decibels instead handles all matters in phone calls with a Bluetooth headset always with him. By this he always outshines all the hurdles and threats posed by the Protagonist.The dialogues are placed pitch perfect for the characters and the situations that it does not seem like the they were placed intentionally to spice up the scene. Some of the best scenes would the one when Mahima (played by Nayanthara ) advises Mithran that his anxiety has become his addiction which is killing him slowly and the one where Siddarth Abhimanyu gets to know about Mithran, instead of going for the big kill decides to bring him down morally.This movie is one such rare gem in Tamil Cinema that it will be always remain eternal for its theme, making and presentation on screen with class and style. This movie was the game changer for Jayam Raja and Jayam Ravi and also gave a confidence that good story can always make good cinema when presented unadulterated."
" its Overrated
",0.0,0.96,2017-02-06 00:00:00,2,don't get me wrong. First Of all I liked this movie. But This movie is among top 5 Tamil movies ? I'm not saying this movie is bad.. in fact this movie is good comparing to lot of mainstream garbage movies nowadays(like movies of Vijay ). I'm just saying it doesn't deserve the current rating in IMDb. It is an above average film.The main attraction of the movie is of course performance of actors(Aravind swami to be specific). The main drawback of the movie is the script. Many unwanted scenes(like love story). Even without those scenes the script was not that brilliant. Yeah it's a cat and mouse play and character development of hero and Villain was good. I don't have that much negative to say about the movie. But it sure don't deserve 8.6 . 8/ 10 is agreeable
