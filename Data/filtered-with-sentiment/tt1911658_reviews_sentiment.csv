" Cute and cuddly
",0.4588,0.9248,2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"""Comic-relief"" penguins of the ""Madagascar"" franchise got their own spin-off, which may not be as high quality as the franchise they came from, but it is no less fun.The frustrated octopus envies the penguins for being cute and wants to destroy all the species that are cuter than his own. It is up to our hilarious four to save the world from this unimaginable loss. Modern technologies of the secret service of polar animals, resourcefulness, and courage of our heroes are not up to this task, but penguins have a secret weapon - cuteness and cuddliness.This action-comedy may not feature superb animation, nor the special depth and complexity of the story, but the pace that does not slow down for a moment, crazy action scenes, the constant shooting of various jokes, word games, and references to many film classics and strong cast will not leave you time to pay attention to its shortcomings. After all, who could possibly resist the cuteness and cuddliness of penguins ...7/10"
" JAW DROPPING AND MUDBLOWING
",0.0,0.9851,2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie on new year's eve of 2020 and was tantalized. Skipper, Private, Kowaski, and Rico (my personal fav) were so captivating, suave, and succulent. The one part in the movie where they are in the jungle and drop from the sky as german musicians makes my heart sing and my butt fart. One concept i have observed from many children's movies is the fascination with buttocks, which is also exhibited in this movies . Private's comeback at the end of the movie with him saving the day and the self sacrificing butt arm fiasco really develops his character and makes the movie. Private truly becomes a meaningful and useful member of the team by the end of the movie; he also gains courage, confidence, and antlers by the end of this movie. With my full heart i love this movie and have bought, and hung, a poster of this movie in my room. a cherished new years memory and a loving, hilarious, wholesome, and educational children's movie for all ages."

",0.895,0.9359,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"For me this movie is great comedy, you can even watch it with no audio at all, and it will make you laugh a lot, it reminds me of the Looney Tunes because of this extremely good cartoony (or exaggerated physics) animation, which shows extremely clearly what's going on.Some people rate this movie poorly because ""the story is not very interesting"" or similar things, and even if the story is not the most interesting, or not as interesting as others like Kung Fu Panda, the movie is a lot of fun and definitely one of my favorite animated movies, and a must-watch.Just watch it in order to have a laugh, and don't have very high expectations on a very interesting plot."
" Great spin-off film for The Penguins.
",0.6249,0.9574,2020-10-08 00:00:00,6,"In 2005, The Penguins were first seen in the film Madagascar and became liked by many. In 2008, The Penguins got their own TV-Series, The Penguins of Madagascar. In 2014, The Penguins got their own SPIN-OFF film! I liked it a lot, The Penguins were great and got sent to an adventure on a secret mission. Unfortunately, the film would've been better if it had a better story. I did like the secret agents and are the high points of the film, but they didn't had that much character development.Overall, the film is a great James Bond-themed adventure."
" Rare Example of a Well-Made, Smartly-Conceived Spinoff
",0.0,0.8226,2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Given that the prime Madagascar series is an average-at-best taste of mainstream family fare, you'd be forgiven for writing this one off. Side character spinoffs are almost always a sign of last gasps, of attempts to wring the last drips of juice from a brand that's already reached the end of the line. So it's with no shortage of surprise that I report this Penguins movie is, actually, a bright, entertaining standalone.On the run from an aggressive team of sinister octopi, and competing with an arrogant squad of big-budget secret agents, the titular black-and-white quartet clumsily uncovers and defeats a vile (if completely nonsensical) master plan. Another eight-tentacled beast is behind all the bad news: Dave, a brainy purple octopod voiced by a spry, show-stealing John Malkovich. He's a wonderful foil, colorful in more than a visual sense and incredibly flexible as a sight gag. With so many straight men in the main roles, Penguins was bound to live or die by its comic relief. Whether he's juggling silly recurring puns or trying to unravel loopy plot threads, Malkovich makes sure his essential, mood-straddling part is a strength, not a liability.He's the dash of spice that makes the recipe, although the CG team certainly pulls their weight. In that respect, Dreamworks has come a long way since their floundering first efforts in the early aughts. This looks polished and effortless, with dozens of well-executed comic/action scenes and a well-rendered cast of distinct, versatile original characters. It's not going to reinvent the wheel or anything, but by staying in its lane, carefully sharpening the axe and spotlighting a few key vocal performances, Penguins has managed to improve upon the spirit of its parent series."

I wouldn't mind seeing a spin-off about the origins of the North Wind, the spy agency that his character runs. It would be awesome. I was a bit hesitant that this would kill the Madagascar franchise like Shrek Forever After killed the Shrek franchise but I gave it a chance and it was great. Sorry, Pixar but I think Dreamworks will eventually knock you off the top spot as the best animation studio. I loved everything about this movie. It's perfect.

" Cute and Cuddly
",0.4588,0.9991,2019-09-26 00:00:00,8,"While I do think that The Penguins work better in a series of short episodes, I did enjoy this movie a lot. It does a lot of things right that the TV series didn'tOne thing that I didn't like so much in this was the amount of new characters. DreamWorks has this weird habit of adding way too many characters with the already existing ones. This makes the characters seem 2 dimensional, boring, not fleshed outThe North Wind wasn't the worst cast of characters. They fit in with the plot, they help with progression and the message of the film. But compared to the penguins, they seem bland and just a tool to get the story goingI love the visuals in this film! Everything looks so good! The characters all fit well in the environment. Their designs look like they're from the same world. The backgrounds are beautiful and detailed, the colors are bright and the animation is smooth and brings the characters to life. I especially like how they made the penguins more distinguishable (like in the TV show). Rico even got a completely new design that really suits his characterOne of my favorite scenes visually is when the penguins fall off the plane. The camera angles/movement bring excitement and action to the scene. It really keeps you on your toesThe plot was mediocre but it had a lot of great moments some of which were a bit too cheesy for my taste but cute nonetheless. I love that the movie focused on Private trying to impress the others to show that he is an important part of the team as well. A very emotional scene is when Skipper hands over his leadership to The North Wind to save Private. It is a scene that everybody should see. The expressions and reactions of the characters make it. It really does pull on your heartstrings when you (for example) see Rico almost cryingI still listen to the soundtrack from this film. The main theme and Private's theme are awesome pieces of art as well as the rest. A memorable soundtrack keeps me interested for years and I re-watch the movie just to feel the full impact of all the best scenes
The sound in general is excellent in this film. All the voice actors did a great job and I love how many of the characters have accents. It makes them more recognizable and funThis movie could've been a lot better but I'm still very happy with how it turned out. I came to the theater to see the penguins and I saw the penguins so I'm more than satisfied"
" Love for Penguins, but nothing amazing
",-0.3628,0.5883,2019-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Fighting against a revengeful octopus, the penguins squad have also to compete with its analog squad made of wolves and bears. In this plot, the prequel of ""Madagascar"" affirms all the typical values of a standard kid animation movie: the match between beauty and ugliness, the acceptance of diversity, the emotiional disorder (penguins) against the efficient order (wolf and company), etc., with a final positive (but it's the rule) message. This spin-off works like all the mascot spin-off (cfr. ""Minions"" or ""Il gatto con gli stivali""), with the narrative construction tender to create occasion for gags. The sketches are funny, but the total result is weak, or at least not surprisingly and predictable. Just for fun."

",0.0,0.5645,2018-12-02 00:00:00,6,"This is the worst Madagascar movie out of the four. This isn't a bad movie, it's just that this is not a needed sequel. The worst part of this is that Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are not in this so it doesn't work. The villain is a good villain (it is like megamind but as an octopus. So you can check this out if you want but you might be disappointed. As for our four hero's (the penguins) they are constantly trying to make people laugh."
" This movie does not have a decent script and was just meant to make money.
",0.0,-0.9681,2018-11-29 00:00:00,2,"This film is the perfect example of a problem that has consumed animation films: when a film becomes popular, its immediately consumed by the industry and turned into a dollar-making machine, with a colossal dose of sequels, TV series, merchandising and prequels at every moment. After the success of Madagascar, Dreamworks hastened to do so. When the fountain dried up, they noticed the popularity of the penguins, who were more than secondary characters initially, but to whom it was being given relevance, and decided to make a film where the protagonists are them. Of course it was a mistake. It was the same with Timon and Pumba from ""Lion King"", with the Minions from ""Despicable Me"" etc.Okay, I agree Penguins were funny in that context in which they were born. But I do not think they have what it takes to be protagonists. After three ""Madagascar"", where their participation was growing, they were worn out and had nothing more to offer. When we look at the script of this movie, this is evident. There's nothing new, it's just a means to profit at the expense of the popularity of the four characters.In addition to this problem, the film has the most idiotic script I've seen in many years. Simply poorly done, it has more holes than a fishing net. You see, penguins enter Fort Knox, the most sheltered place in the United States after the White House, to devour snacks they'd find in an ordinary convenience store, but the snack machine has a crazy octopus that wants revenge because people like penguins ... then the whole movie is centered on the quest for outlawed octopus, the struggle to curb his plans and an idiotic rivalry between the penguins and a kind of millionaire organization that protects animals (but the octopus is not an animal?) at risk and helpless ... Now you ask: how did the octopus know that the penguins would enter Fort Knox? How did he get in there in the first place? What is the origin of the mysterious substance that transforms penguins into monsters? Where does the ""North Wind"" money come from? I do not know what you think, but I kept thinking the writers should be drunk or drugged when they wrote this.Technically, the film does not bring anything interesting either. I have seen CGI better and more realistic, the animations are not beautiful nor bring the brightness of other films, the colours seem a little faded and the soundtrack is quite weak."
" I can't get enough of this movie
",0.0,0.9935,2018-11-14 00:00:00,8,"A tiny spin off movie on the 4 penguins of madagascar.......
Did I think it would be good movie? No, I thought it would be super bad.But I am very happy to say that this movie shocked the hell out of me, it is very good, and should be getting more positivity. This definitly ranks in the 25 best movies I have ever seen personally.My favorite part about this movie are the characters. Easily some of the best character development in a movie I've ever seen. Seeing Skipper see Private as a little loser and overlooking him for about 70% of the movie, to then seeing him mourn over a fallen foe when Private is obliterated right in front of him(not really). To Skipper suddendly realizing that out of all of the members in the team, Private is truley the one that cares the most about helping. It teaches us a very important life lesson that our appearances don't determine if you are important/special or not. It's really our personality, and what we bring to the table. Like how Private is truley the one in the group, that cares about the rest of the members. He makes the team realize that they are a family, not just a team.The plot was alo very interesting. The classic overlooked villian that wants revenge on the penguins, and they did that pretty well.Humor was not bad. They threw in very little humor that possible an adult can blow wind though their nose at, but it's a movie directed to children so what do you expect.
There was this one scene at the climax of the movie where the team assembles, then they jup and turn around and the camera starts to movie around them, kinda like the badass scene from the Avengers in 2012, where they are in a circle and the camera moves around them. It was the same exact scene, but WITH THE PENGUINS! Most badass moment in the film. I was extremetly satisfied with this scene. A real get-out-of-your-seat-and-run- around-the-theater-pumping-your-fists-and-screaming moment.Also the ending of the movie was very good. The ending of the movie almost made me cry because of how for overlooked member in the family gets his shinning moment and finally gets recognized by the rest of the group. Very touchingNow on to things I didn't like. The villian, Dave, very bad. Just a stinky poopy diaper of a villian. I get it, cartoon octopus wanting revenge, childs movie, etc. But they really just made dave as a character that just: ""Oh yeah him, he's there alright, and he's bad, VERY bad"" I believe that Dreamworks had room to give him development, or at least changed his backstory to make his motives for kidnapping the peguins seem just or might support what he was doing.KOWALSKI! ANALYSIS OF THE MOVIE!I'm giving this an 8/10. Definitly an outstanding movie for the family to sit down and watch together. For the kids, They will love Dave no matter what. But for older audience members, he'll be very forgettableThanks for reading!"
" Bad...
",0.0,-0.7912,2018-09-07 00:00:00,4,"Bad, so I can summarize the whole movie ...
script loose and that only focuses on the comedy in absurd jokes, badly plasificados and badly developed characters, animation and good logical section, in the script, the film does not advance, since they only focus on loose jokes, which seems more caricature of 90 minutes instead of an animated movie, it does not even feel like dreamworks ... 4 / 10."
" Penguins of Madagascar
",0.0,0.9823,2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"The penguins of the three Madagascar movies very often stole the scenes that they appeared in, so it was almost inevitable that they would be given their own spin-off movie, they did have some straight-to-DVD stuff, but this was am official cinema release. Basically in Antarctica, penguin brothers Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller) and Rico (Conrad Vernon) save an unhatched penguin egg from a pack of leopard seals, the egg hatches, and they name their member Private (Christopher Knights), they also accidentally send themselves adrift on an iceberg. Ten years later, after the events of Europe's Most Wanted, the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday, but Private has recently started to feel out of place with the team. Suddenly, the penguins are abducted by a machine and sent to Venice, Italy by renowned geneticist Dr. Octavius Brine. The doctor reveals his true identity, he is actually an octopus named Dave (John Malkovich), who has grown resentful of penguins, because of their cuteness it caused him to become shunned in every zoo and aquarium he was taken to across the world. Rico swallows Dave's collection of snow globes, and a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum, before the penguins escape and are chased by henchmen. When cornered, they are rescued by a group of Arctic animals, an undercover task force agency called ""The North Wind"", led by a gray wolf whose name is Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch), along with demolitionist harp seal Short Fuse (Ken Jeong), polar bear Corporal (Peter Stormare), and intelligent snowy owl Eva (Annet Mahendru). Dave manages to hack their hideout communication systems, he reveals he has a large supply of Medusa Serum and intends to capture all penguins across the world at the places he was kicked out. Seeing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, the North Wind tranquilise the penguins and send them to the most remote location possible, which happens to be Madagascar. But the penguins wake up mid-flight and crash land in the Sahara Desert, they manage to make their way to Shanghai, China, which they mistake for Dublin, Ireland. Using the collection of snow globes swallowed by Rico, they determine the order of locations Dave plans to travel to, they ship themselves to their current location and make their way to the zoo. Once there, Private winds up captured with the Shanghai penguins, the North Wind try to put a stop to the villain's plan, but the penguins intervene, allowing Dave to escape, but Private has a tracking device planted by Classified. On the island, Dave demonstrates his way to mutate penguins into hideous monsters, causing humans to be disgusted by them, part of his plan of revenge. Skipper and Classified argue about the best way to rescue the captives and stop Dave, they eventually settle on Classified's plan, a frontal assault, with Skipper and the others acting as a diversion. After escaping apparent disintegration from a faulty mutation ray demonstration by Dave, Private rescues the captured North Wind members, meanwhile Dave turns on his ray and mutates all penguins into hideous monsters, the brainwashed penguins run amok on terrified humans. Private finds Skipper, Kowalski and Rico mutated, he decides to connect himself to the ray to return them to normal, and they manage to turn all penguins back to normal with one giant blast. Private has been left partially mutated (he is turned back later), while Dave has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself trapped inside a snow globe. In the end, Classified respects the penguins as equals and promises them anything they want, they get their own jet packs and fly off to their next adventure. Also starring Andy Richter as Mort the mouse lemur, Danny Jacobs as King Julien XIII the ring-tailed lemur and Werner Herzog as the Documentary Filmmaker. The leading characters we know are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face, the new additions to the cast are good as well, obviously the animation is fantastic, and to be fair there were some amusing jokes, even the name puns (""Nicolas! Cage them!"" and ""Charlize, they're on the ray!""), but as with Madagascar they do not have quite enough charm, an average animated family comedy adventure. Okay!"
" Fun filler.
",0.5106,0.9568,2018-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a really dumb movie that knows that its dumb. To enjoy this movie, you're going to need to suspend your disbelief for a bit. Though it might seem like I didn't enjoy this nonsense, I actually did. This movie is funny and absurd and most people will enjoy it. I'm not saying that this is a good movie - but it is funny and entertaining and there is a lot of fun animation here. I'd recommend watching it. Not over and over again on repeat, but if you're bored, this is worth watching."
" A clumsy, yet still funny movie.
",0.4404,0.9954,2018-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Comic relief in animated movies typically don't translate well to starring roles in their own movie. Most of the time, a studio typically sees profit in some of their movies and try to take the funniest characters from their movie series and try to give them their own film, mostly to unsuccessful results. The most notable example was Pixar's disastrous ""Cars 2"" which ended up becoming one of my least favorite animated movies of the decade so far. With that said, I did go in nervous to ""Penguins of Madagascar"". I really liked the Madagascar series due to it's very funny humor with some good laughs coming from the penguins. Though I really think that they are good characters, I wasn't sure a movie about them would work out well. Luckily enough, it does have some very funny moments, yet I feel at times that the film is essentially two films combined into one which results in some unbalanced elements. What exactly do I mean, you may ask? Well I'll explain why.At first, the film actually did start off very promising. The Penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private (played by four of DreamWorks own employees, Tom McGarth, Chris Miller, Christopher Knights, and Conrad Vernon) decide to leave the circus behind, having being driven crazy by that Circus Afro song (which I will admit is some pretty fantastic writing) and break into Fort Knox for not gold or the governments top secrets, but Cheetos. It only gets more complex when they are kidnapped and taken to Venice where it's revealed that an octopus named Dave (John Malkovich) is planning revenge on the penguin race by turning them into horrible creatures due to him always being overlooked by the creatures in his zoos. The penguins escape leading to a thrilling chase with octopi minions only to be rescued by an elite Arctic group known as the North Wind led by a wolf known only as Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch). His agents include a seal named Short Fuse (Ken Jeong), a polar bear named Corporal (Peter Stormare) and a snow owl named Eva (Annet Mahendru). Knowing of the evil secret plan of Dave, the penguins decide to try to stop the plan in order to prevent the extermination of the penguin species.Right from that synopsis I can name by biggest problem with the movie. The plot. It's not a bad idea for a plot as I do like the idea of the penguins going up against an evil octopus as subplot in a fourth Madagascar movie, but it's a story that just doesn't seem suitable as a main plot. Most of the time I kept expecting Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman to pop up which wasn't a good sign. Speaking of which, let me explain why I think the movie was essentially two films as one. Throughout the movie I felt like the sections involving the Penguins and Dave was part of a failed TV movie and the North Wind aspects were part of a failed feature film idea and were unsuccessfully combined together. Had they had stayed separate, I feel that they would have been very successful on their own, yet put together makes them feel like a convoluted mess. With that said though, the movie is pretty funny at times which did redeem some of the movies weaker moments. As for the animation, it's decent. It's not as incredible as ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" which came out the same year, though I do feel that it does stand out with some good cartoony moments. And now, let's talk about the characters. The North Wind characters are fantastic. I love how they take on a very cliched spy team which we have seen been done so many times and actually give it some life. Classified in particular was really funny mainly due to Cumberbatch's great performance. Dave also has some good moments as well and John Malkovich was really funny, though I will admit one aspect of him did drive me a little crazy. His running gag was telling his octopi minions and making some sort of actor pun out of it. Examples include, ""Nicholas, cage them"", ""William, hurt them"", ""Halle, bury them"" and ""Elijah, would you hide the evidence"". Every time he said something like that, I kept thinking to myself, ""Yes, you took the actors names and made a pun out of it. Ha ha ha."" It really did get on my nerves.In a whole, ""Penguins of Madagascar"" is not a perfect movie due to its story that feels like it should have been split in half and it's animation that's only decent at best, though it's redeem due to it's characters having some funny moments. I do feel like it's more for kids than it is for adults though I don't think it's bad at all."

The penguins must join forces with another team of elite animals, in their attempt to stop the villain from achieving his goal.It's an enjoyable and most of all funny movie which contains almost everything you can want from an animation. Great effects and characters, lots of action and some suspense, just to spice things up a bit.

I really appreciate work of all cast to put such a good movie."
" Medium film relative to the nickelodeon series
",0.0,0.9942,2017-08-26 00:00:00,7,"I will start by saying that I have enjoyed much more the series that is broadcast on Nick than the movie. The series in Nick is excellent, in the top 5 of the best series I've seen in Nicoladeon, but the movie just does not. The beginning of the film made me feel that it was going to be a completely different film from the rest of the film , a good and interesting film, but unfortunately this is not the case. The film is quite boring, the screenwriters could have thought of a much better film for the four amazing characters I'm so fond of penguins. It's true that there are some funny things in the film but at least I do not see drama in the film, I do not expect blood and shooting, but I certainly expected much better than the wonderful characters of the penguins. The rate I give him is 7 only because I love the four penguins from Madagascar, but I think it deserves more 6."
" Relatively harmless fluff... or feathers

Since it was the only animated movie I had any interest in reviewing, I decided to watch it. I feel rather mixed about doing so, but regret isn't necessarily one of them. The story does feature some clichés, though in at least one instance they make that a joke by halting said cliché to do something else. The messages are rather commendable, though Dr. Brine had a really awkward comeuppance. Speaking of which, the humor is what you'd expect from a movie about Minion precursors, with mostly childish gags but a few jokes that indeed are worth a chuckle. It does have some nice paced scenes (and cliché but epic slow-motion), which the animation also depicts really well. The style of the animation is identical to Madagascar (probably not necessary to write that) and it works in a way that it could straightforwardly occur as a mainline Madagascar film. It does have enough tropes, such as caricaturing various gadgets in action, to make it stand out enough as a spin-off. The characters have realistic mindsets and are all tolerable at worst, though the titular penguins' idiocy was one aspect I believe could have been written better. At times, Penguins of Madagascar even seems like one of those movies where to enjoy it, you have to power your brain off, though this isn't the case for all of it. If you are a fan of Madagascar, penguins, cute things, or distractions for children, then I would recommend this to you. If you are just a usual animation buff or moviegoer, then I would advise a bit of caution before you watch it."
" Excellent!

The animation and the humor is perfect. All family will enjoy it! It's a lovely movie to share with friends, family and everybody in a family night."
