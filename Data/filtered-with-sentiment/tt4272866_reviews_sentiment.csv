" Great animation and imagination
",0.6249,0.5106,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,This film has a story that sets it apart from other films. There is nothing typical or predictable about this one. You really get into the boy's story and have no idea where it will end up. The visual animation quality was spectacular and the world in the film feels very detailed. There was a good dynamic between all the characters.
" A Gorgeous, Imaginative Modern Fairy Tale
",0.6124,0.2301,2020-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Beneath (or maybe parallel to) our world lies a secret land, populated by mythical creatures and governed by a strict, traditional code. Orphaned by his mother and abandoned by his father, one angry young boy finds his way between the two planes and begins an apprenticeship with a tenacious, if temperamental, fighting bear. Together, they learn and grow, developing physically as well as spiritually, but never completely reaching a full, placid understanding. Their mutually headstrong ways stand in the way of such a harmonious accord.This is where the real interest of the film lies, a father-son relationship that's complete with bumps, warts and stubborn deadlocks. Its fantasy landscape is magical and fascinating, colorfully realized and teeming with life. I just wanted to dwell there for the duration. Later forays back into the human world are an unwelcome distraction, even if they lead to greater depth for the main character, and the climactic battle falls into the same category. It's completely out of left field, under-explained and off-key; a poor match for the softer, more resonant touch that was evident in earlier acts.While it's in the sweet spot, The Boy and the Beast is animated magic. The hand-to-hand fight scenes and training montages are especially wonderful, smoothly and precisely animated with just enough exaggeration to remind us it's an anime. Very good when it's in the zone, but that focus doesn't last forever."
" So much more than just an Anime action film, its a journey!

This has been one of the most fantastic emotional experiences i have ever had a film put me through, altogether it was beautifully implemented. I was laughing, crying with happiness, full of awe, mentally helping the main character with his trials and by the end i was totally and utterly in love with this film.If you want to watch a film you can really feel the characters in then i recommend you don't waste another minute and get this film, get yourself comfortable and dedicate the time to experience it. You will not be disappointed.Writer / Director: Mamoru Hosoda.
Thank you for directing this amazing piece of your artwork for us all to love.
My world is brighter having seen it."

" The whole thing shows the combination of visual flair and wildly inventive storytelling that makes Japanese animation different from the rest of the field.
",0.0,0.991,2019-10-08 00:00:00,6,"Mamoru Hosoda has been seen by some as his natural successor since Hayao Miyazaki, dean of the animated Japanese feature film, announced his retirement from directing.Hosoda isn't exactly embracing an accolade, saying he and Miyazaki have different styles and that's how things should stay. The comparison, however, is understandable. Both have specialized in fantastic-infused coming-of-age stories, both are proponents of hand-drawn animation, and both are very popular. But Miyazaki has a taste for the whimsical while Hosada's latest brand of make-belief on show, Boy and the Beast-already a big hit in Japan-displays a bracing note of vernacular realism.It opens at night in the lights and bustle of the Shibuya district of Tokyo, where nine-year-old Ren tries to escape from the police. His mother died, and his father, who moved away from the divorce of his parents, did not appear to claim him. He's taken off unwilling to be adopted by unsympathetic parents. And when he finds himself in another world, part-menagerie, part-mythological kingdom, he just darted into a alley in the hope of hiding there. His citizens are hybrid creatures with two legs, animal faces and a passion for Japanese martial art kendo, and he starts to feel strangely at home there after a rocky settling-in period.In an effort to relate the highly original script of Hosoda to something cosily familiar, it has been compared to The Jungle Book, but Hosoda has studded it with references to Moby Dick, the idea being that Ren is about to touch-and eventually exorcise-the beast within. In other words, beast life will help him cope with the corrosive grudge that he harbors against the world of man.He becomes apprenticed to great, bearish Kumatetsu, a candidate for the Grand Master's post of the kingdom. Kumatetsu is a champion of kendo, but his political outlook is hampered by his strong resemblance to the Incredible Hulk. He's not loved exactly. Yet he and Ren, after a fashion, communicate with each other through a robust exchange of taunts and insults that both seem to find vigorous. And Kumatetsu turns the boy into an unlikely father figure in time.Hosoda favors an eye-catching mix of animation and CGI hand-drawn. In the usual yet disconcerting round-eyed manga style, his human characters are realized. But in designing his supporting cast of ""beasts,"" there is real wit. The retired Grand Master is an outstanding creation, part Confucius, part dozy white rabbit, a venerable-looking creation.The finale is a bit too artificial to carry the charge that Hosoda is aiming for, but the whole thing shows the combination of visual flair and wildly inventive storytelling that distinguishes Japanese animation from the rest of the field."

" Brash but touching.
",0.0,0.8935,2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,"At the heart of 'The Boy And The Beast (2017)' is a compelling, unique and well-observed central relationship. It's this that really drives the experience, evolving over time until it reaches a rather touching climax despite being as brash as they come. The plot, in general, does a good job of balancing the mundane with the not-so-mundane, making everything we see - whether it be born of man or beast - seem grounded and believable. In fact, even the most extraordinary of elements are presented as being, well, ordinary - a wonderful choice that compounds the drama as relatable and nuanced. It's when the movie moves into its final third and starts to introduce some more, I suppose, 'outlandish', genre-specific and seemingly forced aspects that it starts to struggle a bit. By trying to introduce a proper 'villain', it loses a little focus and becomes a lot more generic. Still, this segment is built on theme and character, while leading into an undeniably satisfying conclusion, so it isn't bad, by any means. Neither is a slightly slower section near the flick's mid-section, which takes the plot in an unexpected direction and isn't so much 'worse' as 'different'. It's here that the piece's themes start to really develop, with new ones emerging and old ones solidifying at the same time. The animation style remains consistent and aesthetically-pleasing throughout. It's detailed, fluid and impactful; it really comes to the fore in the few fairly memorable, somewhat 'Rocky (1976)'-like fight scenes. Generally, the picture is highly entertaining. It's engaging, unique and, even, somewhat emotionally resonant. It's not the most memorable experience but, in the moment, it's a very enjoyable one. 7/10"
" A Valuable Contribution to the Anime World
",0.4767,0.9903,2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Momaru Hosada's The Boy and the Beast (2015) crafts a world that is rich and exciting, offering an affirmation of the relationship's power to achieving self-actualization. Though the film is a vibrant addition to the world of anime, Hosada's tribute to familial bonds reaches beyond existing fans of that school of film. You don't need to know anything about Japanese animation to appreciate this film, just family.The Boy and the Beast centers on a street urchin boy named Ren who stumbles upon a fantastical world of beasts, animal-like beings with the potential to become gods. He finds himself in the care of a brutish warrior beast known as Kumatetsu, a prime candidate to succeed the soon-to-retire lord of the realm. The two form a powerful, if turbulent, bond resembling father and son, and Ren makes his home in the world of the beasts under Kumatetsu's tutelage. But Ren's inevitable maturation threatens to lead him away from his Neverland, and Kumatetsu. As Ren is beckoned by the calls of adulthood, including college in the human world and the human father he thought he lost, the distance between him and Kumatetsu widens. But as an emerging conflict threatens to destroy both the human and beast world, Ren and Kumatetsu have to face the challenge together in a way that compels them to achieve a new level of union as both teacher and student and as father and son.The surrogate parental relationship is the through-line of the film. When we first see Ren sulking through the city streets, the audience may be inclined to wonder what Jiminy Cricket figure is going to take Ren under his wing and nurture him into maturity. Kumatetsu in all his laziness and short-temperedness seems to exist primarily to thwart this archetype, and the audience learns that he is just as much in need of someone to show him the ways of adulthood as Ren is. The relationship between Kumatestu and Ren (whom he dubs Kyuta) is almost defined by its volatile nature from the start. The two spend quite a bit of time through the film yelling at (and sometimes chasing) one another. One might occasionally wonder if the two even like each other, and whether or not we should root for them.Even so, their unusual relationship becomes a testament to the aching loneliness they both experience: Kumatetsu has known the same disregard and negligence that Ren has. In this way, the two are uniquely qualified to sympathize with one another, and the audience finds unexpected tenderness between Ren and Kumatetsu. Though they are often at each other's throats, Ren and Kumatetsu ultimately bring out the best in each other. For example, a pivotal scene in the film has Kumatetsu in the throws of a battle against another beast and sorely losing. Ren compels Kumatetsu out of his stupor of self-pity and on to victory by screaming at him ""What are you doing, you chump!? Get up already!"" It's scenes like this where the audience can peek into the understated sentiment they have for one another.The backdrop of this relationship is a stunningly designed world. The world of the beasts is vibrant and steeped in lore and mythology that begs to be explored. Bright and colorful, and full of anthropomorphic animal creatures, the movie's design seems to dwell in some midground between Avatar the Last Airbender and Pokemon, and it takes the best of both. Though the coloring and detail isn't as picturesque as Makoto Shinkai's Your Name, the design of the world seems to come from a brand of mythology that predates the film. The animation here is cartoonish enough to be exciting yet painterly enough to feel transporting.In the wake of Miyazaki's retirement, the world is searching for the next leading auteur of anime. Could Momaru Hosada be that figure? He has a definite shot. Hosada's monster world is at least as whimsical as what's seen in Spirited Away. He will definitely fill the need for those who grew up watching My Neighbor, Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service as kids and are now entering adolescence. Hosada's going to have a harder time finding that same support among the child audience Miyazaki is known for, at least for this movie. This film features more blood, punching, and (yes) impalement than most Miyazaki films. This film will please existing fans of anime but should not be used to initiate younger audiences into the genre.The film definitely carries the torch of anime, but the film's audience is not limited exclusively to those already familiar with the genre. Ren's journey from an angry, lost child to an emotionally grounded adult is emotionally charged and cathartic. His relationship with the gruff but strangely endearing Kumatetsu provides comfort for anyone who knows what it's like to love someone who isn't easy to love. Watch the movie for a fantasy spin on Karate Kid, or in remembrance of someone you didn't know would be important to you."
" A mediocre disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.9313,2018-11-14 00:00:00,6,"Mamoru Hosoda has a distinctive style of portraying motion of both the characters and as well as the motion of time.
This movie definitely has those DNA elements but it's done so poorly, Hosoda's previous works ,
1)the girl that leapt through time ,shows the passing of time in the teenage years from the view of a girl , melancholic and full of unexpected surprises .
2)wolf children , passing of time from a mothers point of view, its so rewarding watching the children grow up and going on their own paths .
3)summer wars, passing of time from a generational point of view, when the old ways of life are now being integrated instead of overtaken is a very unique view and Hosoda nailed it. But
This movie(the boy and the beast) was trying to show the passage of time from a father's perspective , as the imagery of paternal care is every where throughout the film but is done is a way that comes of mediocre, we don't feel when Ren/kyuta(protagonist) grows , we don't feel him learn, it just happens and its a disappointment when we go from watching a 9 year old boy to a 17 year old in just 30 min in a 2 hour film.
For a film that supposed to be an empathatic one, it has alot of story beats that revolve one the outside instead of the inside as one would expect from a film about growth( as growth can come only from the inside) and the movie tries to do so with its various 'emotional' dialogues and scenes that honestly feel so out of place.
And now comes the real reason why this film was underwhelming, the supposed antagonist, this person was so out of place and filled it dumb obvious Moby dick references that I almost felt insulted at the film trying to push the 'darkness of mankind' thing so far that it just comes of being so childish , a terrible conclusion
Is it worth a watch? Sure
Is it worth carrying it throughout ur life? Absolutely no"
" Fantastic Collision
",0.2732,0.9393,2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,"Bakemono no ko, or The Boy and the Beast, is a gorgeous tapestry of teen angst, familial bonds, and fantastic beasts and magic. A young orphan runs away from home and is swept into an apprenticeship with a Master Swordsman Bear-Man (Kumatetsu) from an alternate world. The two navigate the pitfalls of sword fighting, adolescents, and the darkness that humans carry with them into the Beast World, while Kumatetsu attempts to become the next GrandMaster of the Beast World. With an elegant animation style, simple raw emotional dialogue, and a clear and concise plot, this Japanese film delicately presents a heart-wrenching tale of youthful emotion and the progression from boy to man. Directed by Mamoru Hosoda who is also known for the popular movie ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (2006), which delivers an equally potent emotional punch, this movie showcases a lovely balance of violence and tender emotion."
" A FLAWED EPIC THAT'S NOT AS EPIC AS IT THINKS
",0.0,0.9866,2018-07-20 00:00:00,7,"A beautifully animated adventure that's (almost) perfectly told. Yes, ""The Boy and the Beast"" has an epic story that, in my opinion, is not as epic as it thinks (especially in acts 2 & 1). The character arcs were on point and the movie, most of the time, is very fun to watch. I did have a couple of major problems with the movie:1.) Kaede is JUST a love interest. She was introduced late in the movie making her the obvious love interest for Kyuuta/Ren. That was her only purpose.2.) Why does Ichirohiko look like a beautiful girl!? Had his brother not said that Ichirohiko is his brother, I would not realize that Ichirohiko is a guy.(((VAGUE SPOILERS FOR NUMBER 3)))
3.) Near the film's 90-minute mark, something unexpected happened. Unexpected because it was unlike the first hour and a half of the movie. It made me form a different (darker in tone) expectation for the film's last half hour. However, the ending is consistent (tone-wise) to what I formed prior to the ""thing that happened unexpectedly."" This. however, damaged the film for me. Despite the fact that it's consistent (tone-wise) with what I originally formed, I would've liked the darker (tone-wise) ending I formed after the ""thing that happened unexpectedly.""DESPITE THESE MAJOR PROBLEMS, I STILL LIKED""THE BOY AND THE BEAST."""
" A dazzling blend of coming-of-age and fantasy...
",0.0,0.8248,2017-11-18 00:00:00,8,"People continuously praise Studio Ghibli, but meanwhile there's other anime films that deserve spotlight, and The Boy and the Beast is one of them. Although the two lead characters share a familiar and repetitive chemistry, the film has affective storytelling and superb animation to back it up. A dazzling blend of coming-of-age and fantasy. If you enjoy Hayao Miyazaki's films, do consider viewing Mamoru Hosoda's work: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Summer Wars, Wolf Children, and The Boy and the Beast."
" Sparky urban anime
",0.0,0.7675,2017-11-05 00:00:00,6,"THE BOY AND THE BEAST is a likable anime feature set in a contemporary urban Japan. It's a little in the spirit of a Studio Ghibli feature, with a young male protagonist entering a bizarre world of monsters and half-human creatures who live by their own strict societal codes. The adventure that follows is sparky, hard-edged, and fast-paced, with lots of humour arising from the characters and action to see it through. The quality of the animation is top-notch, as you'd expect, and if this isn't particularly poignant as a Ghibli film would be, it still impresses."
" More a beauty than it is a beast
",0.624,0.9986,2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Love anime, especially the best of Studio Ghibli (particularly the likes of 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'), and love animation in general.Having loved Mamoru Hoshoda's previous three films, it was inevitable that his latest film 'The Boy and the Beast' was highly anticipated. Was not let down, it may be Hoshoda's weakest film but that is just testament to how wonderful 'The Girl Who Leapt in Time' (my favourite), 'Summer Wars' and 'Wolf Children' are, though picking a favourite between them was difficult. Because 'The Boy and the Beast' is still a very good film, two thirds of it even being great. Is it the most original anime there is? No, there are some familiar tropes here though in no way is this a bad thing. Have these tropes been executed a little more imaginatively elsewhere? Sure. Does 'The Boy and the Beast' still do a good job with these tropes and the storytelling? Absolutely.It is somewhat a shame that the final third is not as good as the first two acts. The pacing does lose its excitement while the storytelling itself becomes rushed (especially the main villain's reveal that comes rather suddenly and doesn't feel explored enough) and jumpy, meaning that the film loses some of its cohesiveness.On the other hand, the animation is amazing. The way it's designed is almost realistically photographic, while there are some inventive shots, very natural character designs and gorgeously detailed and real-looking background art with a great contrast between the vibrant pastel colours of Jutengai and the drabness of Shibuya. The music score is a mix of rousing and melancholic, always easy on the ears and at times dream-like.'The Boy and the Beast' was clearly written with a lot of thought and insight, and balances the funny and poignant moments beautifully. The story has familiar but universal tropes and very relevant and relatable themes (love, friendship and peace being the big ones), executing them very intelligently and inventively gripping. It's nearly always entertaining and it's touching too, with something for everyone of any age and gender.Characters are very well-written and interesting, never being too black and white, too perfect or stereotypical. These are characters with flaws but also with enough to make one want to identify with them. The conflicts, in individual characterisation and with how the characters interact, are very believable and delivered with tension. More could have been done with the main villain perhaps but this didn't bother me.Voice acting is very dynamic and fit the characters very well.Overall, very good film that may be Hosoda's weakest out of a very strong filmography but is more a beauty than it is a beast. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" ""Beast""-mode ""The Boy and the Beast""
",0.0,0.9929,2017-08-25 00:00:00,8,"No, this isn't ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991), though this story also involves beasts - in animated form. This is ""The Boy and the Beast,"" the most recent Japanese animation (Anime') offering from director/writer/producer Mamoru Hosoda, who is very quickly becoming one of the greats in Anime' - after such revered Japanese Anime' directors like Mamoru Oshii (""Ghost in the Shell,"" the ""Patlabor"" series), Yoshiaki Kawajiri (""Ninja Scroll,"" ""Wicked City,"" ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""), Katsuhiro Otomo (""Akira,"" ""Steamboy"") and of course, the now-retired Anime' legend Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away,"" ""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Ponyo,"" etc.)Hosoda has come a long way from his debut ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (2006) and my personal favorite of his, 2009's ""Summer Wars."" It was the latter film of his that convinced me of Hosoda's true worth as an inspired director.Hosoda's films are not easily categorized, in that they often combine genres ranging from comedy, to science fiction, to fantasy, to heartfelt character-driven dramas. It is this skillful blending of different genres that set his ""Summer Wars"" apart from a lot of Anime' features produced nowadays (most films, period), and why I considered it one of the best animated films so far this millennium.And now we're at his most recent, 2015's ""The Boy and the Beast."" While not as strong as his previous entries, it is by no means a wasted effort. True to his form, ""The Boy and the Beast"" combines different storytelling genres to tell an inspired fantasy tale that while not completely original, does seem fresh and unique given the interesting scenario that the film's events take place in.In Japan's Shibuya district, Ren is a nine-year-old orphan struggling to get by on the streets by any means necessary. One night, he accidentally stumbles upon the so-called ""Beast Realm,"" a world inhabited by, well, beasts, who take on many characteristics shared by those living in the human world. He is taken in by the gruff, unkempt bear-like warrior-beast Kumatetsu (who appears to be based on late Japanese film legend Toshiro Mifune's ""Kikuchiyo"" character from ""Seven Samurai""), who needs an apprentice, as he is competing to become the new lord of the Beast Realm.The two bicker constantly, but over time an unconventional teacher-student/father-son relationship develops between the two, and Ren, who Kumatetsu unceremoniously renamed ""Kyuta,"" becomes a master student who eventually earns the begrudging love and respect of his teacher.""The Boy and the Beast"" delivers much of what it promises: stunning animation (complemented by helpful CGI in more than a few places), a sincere and heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and stunning action sequences. ""The Boy and the Beast"" is not ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" or even ""Summer Wars,"" but this is nonetheless a strong and entertaining entry in a distinguished director's catalog who can only keep going up.8/10"
" The beast inside
",0.0,-0.0258,2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"""Bakemono no ko"" is a very interesting movie with a couple of very good ideas, well developed, with a nice direction and an engaging drawing style.Ren's mother dies, and he has to go to live with some relatives. However, he is not very happy, all angst and desperation and decides to run away. Lost in Tokyo, a beast meets him and offers him to become his apprentice. Kumatetsu, the beast's name, is strong, and wants to become the next Grandmaster. However, he is also lazy and all his disciples end leaving him. Ren decides to follow him and ends in the 'beast world', a kind of parallel world, where he and Kumatetsu will be forced to understand each other.Subtlety be damned, ""Bakemono no ko"" has its purpose on its face (and on its title, and in every corner of its running time). From ""Moby Dick"" allusions, to mirrors or the beast-human conundrum, Mamoru Hosoda and the plot don't care about being too obvious. However, the delivery is really good, the pace nice, the characters engaging and easy to relate to and the story sweet but also poignant. The biggest problem is the need to have characters fight as if this was another fighting anime (Dragon Ball or Yu Yu Hakusho style). The need to be strong becomes too much related to physical force and defeating the other, something that could have been developed in a smarter way.Otherwise, a movie worth checking."
" Hipster bait.
",0.0,0.9507,2017-02-08 00:00:00,4,"Chris Stuckman recommend this one. Shame I forgot Stuckman can be such a trendy hipster sheep at times. Maybe Japanese animation is his kryptonite... or one of his few kryptonites. Anyway, overall this film is as pointless as it is pretentious and overrated. I did my homework on this one. If you think Summer Wars is a good film, you'll like this. I'm not a fan of Summer War and thought this was worse. But like I was saying, I did my homework on this one and figured out why the director is so bipolar when it comes to having great films and having lame films. Here is the reason, all the films he directs that are written by other people are great. The films he writes and directs usually su@k. Check for yourself. The man just can't write a good screenplay or story to save his life. So in conclusion; this film isn't worth your time. The script is convoluted, the action is lacking/meh and the animation style isn't going to take your breath away. At least Summer Wars had some great animation, I can't say the same for this snooze fest. Skip it."
" Almost a perfect movie.
",0.5279,0.9964,2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Back in high school I used to be obsessed watching all sorts of anime. Years later I still watch the occasional episode here and there of am anime, but never fully finished any. Regardless, I decided to give this a shot.Damn this was this amazing. This is like Karate Kid but more epic. It has comedy, action, fantasy, romance, drama, its perfect. The story is very deep, and so much happens in the 2 hours watching of the movie and is all fleshed out which was great. Lots of movies try to have lots of events and end up feeling rushed and unsatisfying. This movie did this perfectly.There is only one complaint from me, and that's towards the ending act. It's not exclusive to this anime, but usually most anime always need some sort of ""epic finishers"" involving huge crisis and character transformations (think of Dragon Ball Z or Naruto). Thing is this movie without spoiling, was a very down to earth movie with fantasy elements, which was perfect, but then had to throw in some huge finisher that just sort of felt out of place for this sort of movie. It feels like the makers were like ""wait a minute...this is an anime movie, people are probably expecting something over the top so let's give it to them"" and just added 15 minutes of it.Great animation, great story, very deep and heartfelt, just a final act felt sort of out of nowhere and unnecessary, but other than that, The Boy And The Beast was a phenomenal movie, definitely one of 2016 best movies."
