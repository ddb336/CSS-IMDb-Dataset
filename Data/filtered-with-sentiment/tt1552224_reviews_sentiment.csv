" Good movie.
",0.4404,0.9348,2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"The plot is good, the acting is good. There's a few things I didn't like, such as the accents, when you have middle Eastern and Chinese speaking English there doesn't really seem to be any need for out hero's to put on a weird accent for the parts.. Otherwise tho it's a good film. The action is good, the plot moves along nicely and it all wraps up nicely. Not a stand out movie but a good watch. Doesn't Warrant the hate it's received from critics as it is obvious from the start that this isn't competing with historical epics of the past.. Worth a watch."
" Cage ruined it
",-0.4767,0.1397,2021-04-04 00:00:00,5,This film would have been a whole lot better without the appalling accent and ridiculous acting from Nicholas Cage. Almost leapt for joy when his character was killed 🤣🤣🤣
" Two terrible actors
",-0.4767,0.9001,2021-04-03 00:00:00,2,Nicolas cage gives the average man hope. That anyone can be an actor. He is truly terrible in this. Hayden Christensen is basically a plank of wood. I would class this movie as a comedy. It's definitely worth laughing at.
" Rubbish

" Blunt
",0.0,0.7717,2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a waste of time, and one of the many pointless works done by once great Nicholas Cage. Although to be fair, Cage's role was so tiny that it looked like an extended cameo rather than a fully fleshed cast member.This movie would take the viewer through the medieval China where intra dynastic struggle breaks off between children of the dead monarch. For some never-explained reasons two ex-crusaders were present in the land who happen to come into their path and help the ""good"" child win the throne. The backdrop was well done, especially with an average portrayal of melee fights and exchange of arrows. On the other hand the story is super weak and all the emotional set-pieces fail to hit the mark."
" Worst accents in the most funny way
",-0.228,0.0,2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,What more can one expect from a film with Cage in it 🤣
" What you'd expect
",0.0,0.6956,2020-12-05 00:00:00,6,"Whatever u thought when u first saw the cover of the movie is what u end up getting: a moderate, seen this all before, gladiator/ninja-esque movie. But if thats what ur in the mood for, then its worth a watch. I turned it on at 2am and it didnt put me to sleep, so there u have it. Plus it helps if u think nic cage is a genious."
" Nicolas Cage!!! Enough Said!
",0.0,0.8313,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, great action, anything with Nicolas Cage in it is the Bomb Diggy. This man takes on the most complex characters, whether we like it or not and goes to work!"
" Decent time period action movie
",0.0,0.9531,2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Got myself watching this movie, while I postponed it for so long due to the low review ratings.But it was a surprisingly entertaining movie. The world building was greatly done. You actually felt you were launched back into the medieval times, with the silk road like venture leading to China with the diversity of merchants and soldiers crossing each others paths. The costumes and locations were nice and detailed and has a high budget blockbuster feel to it.The lead actress Yifei was stunning in every scene. Hayden Christensen and Nicolage Cage were believable as downtrodden outcast crusaders who were seeking redemption.It has all the ingredients for a nice and simple pass time thats worth the watch."
" Pretty decent movie
",0.4939,0.9194,2020-09-23 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed the movie. Hayden was great in it. Nicholas Cage was ok, his accent kinda threw me off a bit. The kid's accent sounded a bit British to me. The story is pretty predictable, but still good because of Hayden's performance was convincing and intriguing. The fight scenes were well done."
" It could be better, the beginning it's weaker than the rest
",0.0,0.959,2020-08-28 00:00:00,6,"I think this film is a tipical N.American movie where the hero is the best in the foreign country, but this is not the problem.I was near to stop watching the movie because the beginning, but after that it looks better, with more action (more interesting).
It provably would be better if the first part were a flashback just after the scene of the spear.The second problem is the cliché argument where the woman fall in love, and the final is not epic, nor well scripted.Despites all, can be a good movie for a Sunday or holiday."
" Why all the hate?
",-0.5719,-0.2181,2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,I'm not sure why people get so down on Hayden or Cage for that matter. Personally I think this movie was very entertaining sure it had a slow moment or two but so what. I've noticed that movie reviews these days are overly harsh based on petty things that really don't matter. Anyway give it a look and decide for yourself. Thanks for reading.
" Enjoyable Film!
",0.4926,0.914,2020-03-11 00:00:00,7,"So before I get started I must disclose that I'm a huge fan of Hayden Christensen....that aside, I've gotta say that despite incredibly low expectations based on reviews alone, I actually enjoyed this movie.Bad things: camera work/angles, disjointed storyline, underdeveloped characters, rushed plot, Nic Cage's ""accent"" (if we can even call it that) & acting.Good things: Hayden Christensen's acting, the sets & filming locations, costumes, overall story, choreography.It's worth a watch! I found the movie enjoyable. :)"
" Lover it
",0.5859,0.4754,2020-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Would watch it again, I really liked Hayden Christiansen in it"
" Nic is at it again
",0.0,-0.9702,2020-01-02 00:00:00,5,"In the 12th century, Gallain (Nicolas Cage) and Jacob (Hayden Christensen) are Christian crusaders in the Middle East. Gallain is obligated to protect Jacob as a debt to his father. Three years later in the Far East, Jacob has become disillusioned with killing and addicted to opium. The dying emperor appoints 14 year old Prince Zhao to be his successor over his older warrior brother Prince Shing. He sends Zhao and the Imperial Seal away with his older sister Princess Lian (Liu Yifei) as his guardian. Shing kills his father and lays the blame on Zhao. The Black Guards hunts for Zhao and the Imperial Seal.Hayden's acting is still wooden. The role has lots of juicy aspects but he's unable to do anything with it. The character is also bad writing. In one moment, he's an addict unable to function and the next, he's a superhero warrior. The story is rather simple. At first, I was wondering where Nicolas Cage went. Sadly, he comes back. If Hayden is wooden, Nicolas is doing mildly weird. His presence screams B-movie nowadays and this movie doesn't improve his batting average. The general story is generic and the rest is mostly flat."
" Not that bad
",0.431,0.4939,2019-11-30 00:00:00,6,"It's a movie you can watch on a boring rainy day, when you have nothing to do and you have already seen all your favorite movies and series. Hayden is an eyecandy, nice to watch him."
" Sergio Leone Would Be Proud!
",0.5255,-0.3098,2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,"Me in 2015: ""Oh my God...I thought Drive Angry would be the last one, but we finally have it! A movie where Nick Cage's overacting actually has a purpose! HALLELUJAH!""Outcast often garners comparison to similar East-Meets-West historical epics like The Last Samurai and The Great Wall, but it has much more in common with Western classics like Unforgiven and Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy. Of course, I'm not saying it deserves that same level of classic status. No Western this decade not directed by Tarantino can say so. However, I would certainly argue that Outcast comes closest of the 2010s Westerns not in that special circle. It certainly comes closer than its noxious, overpraised contemporaries like True Grit or Hostiles.The story could very easily be seen in structure and character archetypes similar to the works of Clint Eastwood and Clift Montgomery (Both if whom lead actor Hayden Christensen wonderfully embodies in steely stare hiding deep pain and regret as well as his lower, more brooding cadence) A troubled, haunted war veteran and social barbarian lives life as an inebriated drifter, until the daughter of a local government leader calls upon his help to deal with ex-veteran marauders. You could translate this entire script to the mid-1800s plains of Kansas, hardly change many many plot points and you'd have yourself an equally credible Western. More than credible. For a film shot under $10 million, the film is often quite visually striking. Many of the night shots are flat out majestic, feeling pulled off a particularly impressive and staying painting.To compare it to The Last Samurai and Hostiles is also to miss the central message of the film and what makes it resonate with me far more; the idea that redemption is not possible for Western invaders and murderers in Eastern land. Jacob may have earned Lian's love, but he ends the film filled with no more purpose and no more aim and clarity than he did in the beginning. He the way he came, in rags riding a horse. One could say he's riding to a more peaceful place, but to do so would be to ignore Jacob's own words. ""The world would be better off without us."" he sorrowfully confesses to the villain Shing (Played with equal parts ferocity and true tragedy by Andy On.)This is one of my favorite Nicolas Cage performances as well. As I indicated earlier, I was quite frustrated with how previous directors misused Cage's penchant exaggerated performances. They merely pushed for them for cheap entertainment, like a bear beaten into ""dancing."" Here, Cage's furious, delirious depiction of a perpetually drunk, drug addicted war vet kept alive on nothing but self hatred and an earned taste for destruction, works shockingly well. It's very reminiscent of Depp's Jack Sparrow, but with more pathos (Partially the result of a shorter script more focused on character) For me, it's right up there with his performances in the likes of Leaving Las Vegas or Mandy.Given that I brought up Hostiles earlier, I only figured I should get more into why this film works and Hostiles doesn't. It won't take long, because it's very simple; Hostiles uses non-white people as props, Outcast uses them as characters. Lian is proactive, idealistic, pessimistic and cocky. Shing is conflicted, angsty, deceptive and self-pitying. I can't think of a single adjective as clear as these (or, frankly, any adjective at all) to describe the Native American ""characters"" in Hostiles. I can believe that Lian and Shing have their own stories where they're the hero, nowhere does Hostiles give its minorities any such respect.I'm not going to say that most of the people who gave this film a bad review went into it wanting to hate it. That wouldn't be fair to say. But are the main voices we're listening too, the ones seen as most credible on various review sites, the ones who went in with such cynicism based solely on judgmental views of the 2 lead actors? Who held the film to unfair standards next to its contemporaries and had their criticisms made from first view of the trailer? Absolutely.Outcast is one of the best and most underrated films of 2015, as well as being one of the most underrated of the decade. Go in with an open mind and a love for 60s Leone Westerns, and you may find this a real treat."
" Fun Medieval Action Fantasy Movie
",0.5106,0.0514,2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Too many people play the game of hating on Cage. Yes, everyone has made some bad movies, including Tom Hanks. To the point, this one is good. If you don't want to believe the various suspension of belief bits require, then you should not even consider watching a medieval action movie. Gladiator, a great movie. Was it believable? Hell no, but it was fun. So stop hating and just enjoy."
" One of the worst movies I had to sit through
",-0.6249,0.69,2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,"The only good thing about this movie is imagining Nicholas Cage when negotiating the contract for this movie saying ""I'll do it if I get to wear snakes around my wrists like bracelets!"""
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.8173,2018-12-08 00:00:00,3,"So disappointed to see Nicholas Cage in such a bad movie. It was terrible from start till the end. It's like he forgot how to act, everything was unnatural"
" I love Nic but not in this
",0.3818,0.9864,2018-10-19 00:00:00,5,Not a terrible movie. I thought Hayden Christensen was pretty decent. But my Nic Cage was off his game. He could not get his accent down to save his life. He isnt in most of the movie so it was better because of that but definitely not one of my favorite of his. Worth a watch but if you want to see a good crusade movie with Nic watch Season of the Witch.. that was awesome
" Not great but better than I expected
",-0.6435,0.77,2018-09-27 00:00:00,7,I wasnt expecting a good movie due to the review rating here in IMDB but I guess I was relying for it too much for was actually good and not for me. Glad I watched it anyway as it was really fun and entertaining for me.Some lines are bad but not enough to dislike the entire movie. Action scenes and location are really good and entertaining. Hayden and Nicolas were good and fitting for the role but not their best to be praise. There isn't much character development to be honest its more like a straight forward stand up. The movie shines as an action adventure for general viewing which is really good enough for me to continue watching it to the end and where I can at least say its good movie than overall bad.For me I'd say this is 6.5 out of 10 score which still good where I more enjoyed watching it than criticizing it.
" Better than anticipated, but nothing to write home about
",0.2382,0.959,2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie returned on a search for Nicolas Cage so we watched it. Cage role was not large and his performance was not good, but i thought Hayden Christensen was very good. The movie could've been put together a little better but was well done enough to keep me interested. Nearly turned it off when Cage started getting preachy in the Crusade scene- thankfully the movie quickly vaults to China after that. Christensen is the unstoppable force in this movie, of which I haven't seen since Burt Reynolds in Malone or well until the Rock in San Andreas...all in all this is Saturday matinee fare. I enjoyed it but don't expect to be blown away by Nicolas Cage's performance lol"
" Not so bad as usually reviewed
",0.4708,0.711,2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"I think the hatred might be coming from the fact that some people may have expected a lot of this movie and were deceived...
I watched with an open eye and pretty much like it. Nice fights and choregraphy and lovers of the chinese atmosphere will indubitially like it
I think this film isn't that bad but isn't that good either but could deserve better ratings..."
" Too easy, too bad
",-0.1531,0.9667,2018-08-03 00:00:00,2,"It's easy to fall for the temptation of liking an easy film like this. It has action, pseudo-valuable life lessons and the promise of a plot. Just a shame it didn't go further than the ""pseudo"" and the ""promise"". The whole sadly feels like it has been written over one night when someone had a seemingly excitening idea for a movie, but - in all their eager to deliver a blockbuster - ended up with just another cliché packed box of garbage.
I'm sorry. If I was just watching without thinking anything, I would have liked it. But that is exactly what makes it not good. The plotholes are bigger than the story itself and the acting... lets just say this is not why I watch films.But, if an easy terrible action-adventure-movie is exactly is what you're looking for, this is for you. 
If on the other hand you want a good movie, na-ah... you'll be happier with something else."
" LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES
",-0.25,-0.9447,2018-05-11 00:00:00,5,"Jacob (Hayden Christensen) and Glenn (Nicolas Cage) are 12th century crusaders fighting in an unnamed city. Jacob can go into a beserker mode when he says, ""God wills it"" or when someone else says, ""Kill him."" Glenn is regretful about the crusades and opts to go East.The film then opens up in the East with some palace intrigue and a plot evolving like ""Star Wars"" where a princess and her brother flee from the Black Guards. They find assistance in Jacob, an opium addict, who still has his beserker mode working.The film is formulaic as you know exactly what the final fight will be. Cage haters can add this to their list of bad performances, one I would say was worse than ""Left Behind."" WOW! What was that accent supposed to be? Hayden Christenson started out with a strong accent and ended the film without one.Will work as a second tier rental.Guide: F-bomb near end. No sex or nudity"
" Outcast is a Great Movie
",0.6249,0.999,2017-08-29 00:00:00,10,"From the very first scene, this movie exceeded all my expectations. The director was the choreographer for Bourne Identity (2002) as well as several other action movies, and he really outdid himself here. The fights are stunning, incredibly fast paced but coherent. The main attraction is sword fights, but there's a healthy dosage of 1-0-1 combat here and if you enjoy fights from movies such as the Bourne series I can only say you're in for a real treat. There are a lot of innovations too, for instance several shots in the fight sequences are used to make you feel like you're in the fight. It absolutely works and I can't stop watching it over and over again.It's not all dumb action though, the director brings some much needed freshness to filmmaking in the camera work. While the fights are fast, brutal and visceral, the shots of dialogue and more calm scenes are wider and steadier. The audience also gets to see some shots from unexpected places like very close to the surface of the water or the inside of a bowl, which are nicely integrated with the rest of the footage providing an immersive experience. They don't look like Go Pro video at all like in a lot of other movies (if it is then it's very well treated in post production).The movie was mostly shot in China, and it yields beautiful landscapes. We can also see from the viewpoint of the characters eyes at points, something I found to really contribute to the storytelling and used to great effect as you'll see in the movie. The story is really good and has some nice depth to it. The chemistry really works between the cast. Nicolas Cage does a decent job, though his character here doesn't demand much, and Andy On is really good as the films villain. Bill Su Jiahang is terrific as young prince Zhao and the chemistry between the main characters really works. The real highlight here though is Hayden Christensen as Jacob and Yifei Liu as Lian. Hayden is just amazing and really sells his part, while Yifei is just the cutest. They are really great together and there is a nice but reasonable dosage of humor in there too. I'll guarantee you'll be rooting badly for their characters. Combined with a good score is that is very well edited into the movie, this is a beautiful tale. I saw it with my whole family and they all loved it. Speaking for myself as a movie enthusiast, I can say this is a very well made picture.Despite all this greatness however, the shooting style of the action sequences can be it's biggest downfall if the movie is not displayed properly. The fact is the vast majority of TVs around are not up to scratch to display this. I saw it on Blu Ray on an OLED TV, which has an instant response time and 24p playback. I'd say 24p playback is almost a requirement for this movie. Watching it on Netflix on an iPad made many action sequences get overwhelming and messy pretty quick, and I must say this is one of the titles I saw the most difference in video quality between Netflix and Blu Ray. Motion performance is one area where the quality of TVs has actually degraded in the transition from Plasma to LCD and OLED, manufacturers really have to get their act together.It really saddens me to see internet bashers ripping this movie apart. Yes, it has flaws and I could nitpick them all day like some other reviewers have done here, but let's not mistake the forest for the tree. I don't think they're being fair, they love up terrible movies and completely skimp over their glaring and numerous flaws while making a huge effort to bash anything that doesn't adhere to their idea of a great movie. The fact is this is one of the few good movies that have been released in the last few years and I highly recommend watching this in the best quality you can."
" Fun show ... minus Nicolas Cage...
",0.5106,0.2083,2017-08-11 00:00:00,5,It was actually fun to watch. Nicolas cage is and always has been awful. His squinty eye acting trying to portray someone missing an eye made me LOL. He is just awful. Like super awful. Including his bad accent. He is not even really a main character. Hayden was great! I would suggest it as an easy to watch action movie...just ignore the bad actor.
" Horrible movie !
",-0.5848,0.9255,2017-04-21 00:00:00,1,"How did this even get made ?!?! It is a sloppy attempt to retell a story that has been told dozens of times, only this time they throw a couple of white ""Crusaders"" into Imperial China, where of course everyone speaks perfect English (except the ""English"" actors) !Christensen literally delivers every single line in the exact same deadpan voice (and expression). Cage's accent is so bad it'd almost be funny if it wasn't so bad.I guess they blew most of their budget on the salaries of Cage and Christensen and forgot to save some for things like extras and CGI. When I saw the mighty army of ""Black Guards"" (yeah, it's that lame) there must have been like, 20 of them ! Not sure if they stole Gene Simmons ""Kiss"" wig for Cage to wear or maybe it was ""Sho'nuff's"" wig from The Last Dragon. It's one of those movies that you are really, really glad you didn't pay money to see !"
