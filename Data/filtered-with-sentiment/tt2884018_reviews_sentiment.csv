" It's not that bad
",0.431,0.699,2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"The 1 star reviews are mostly gatekeeping Shakespeare fans that hate it because it has a modern style basically. I love the story of Macbeth, and I was hyped for this film, it was very well done but I think the climax could've been done a lot better, it was a little disappointing near the end, apart from that it's good though."
" Macbeth
",0.0,-0.999,2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie based on a tragedy play by William Shakespeare, this one had good names in the cast, and it was rated the full five out of five by critics, so I hoped it would be worthwhile, directed by Justin Kurzel (Assassin's Creed). Basically, Scottish general Macbeth (Michael Fassbender), the Thane of Glamis, is leading the king's troops into a civil war battle. After emerging victorious, Macbeth is approached by three women who are witches (Kayla Fallon, Lynn Kennedy and Seylan Baxter). He is told a prophecy that one day he will become King of Scotland, before the trio disappear. After talking to King Duncan (David Thewlis) who hears of his victory, Macbeth tells his wife (Marion Cotillard) of the prophecy. Lady Macbeth prays to the dark spirits for guidance, and later urges him to kill the King to fulfil the prophecy. The King holds a feast and pronounces his son Malcolm (Jack Reynor) his heir. Macbeth hesitates but Lady Macbeth persuades him to kill Duncan while she drugs his servants. After the feast, Macbeth sees a boy soldier's ghost, who gives him a dagger and he enters Duncan's tent where Macbeth slays him. Shaken he flees, while Lady Macbeth has two daggers and puts them in the sleeping servants' hands. In the morning, Macduff (Sean Harris) finds Duncan dead and Macbeth slaughters the servants to prevent their denial. With Malcolm gone, Macbeth is crowned, but he later complains to his wife. He feels that was all for nothing, as he has no heirs, and the crown will pass to Banquo (Paddy Considine) and his son, Fleance (Lochlann Harris), as prophesied. Following a banquet, Macbeth sends assassins. Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth is enraged when the assassins report that Fleance has escaped. Then, Macbeth is frightened to see Banquo's ghost. His raving continues, prompting Macduff and his wife to leave. Lady Macbeth dismisses the guests and takes Macbeth away. Macbeth talks to the witches who tell him to beware of Macduff. The boy soldier's ghost who gave him the dagger tells Macbeth that he will not be slain by man born of a woman. The King is found wandering by Lennox (David Hayman) who tells him that Macduff has fled. Fearful and angry, Macbeth orders that Macduff's family and servants are killed. The family are burned at the stake, while Lady Macbeth watches distraught. Ross and Angus inform Macduff about his family's murder, grief-stricken and enraged he swears revenge. Lady Macbeth feels guilty for what he and her husband have done to others. In the castle, many believe Macbeth is mad and all fear his anger and tyranny. Macbeth is told that his wife has died, while she was wandering in the hills. Seyton (Scott Dymond) brings news Malcolm is leading an army and Macbeth demands his armour. Macduff fulfils the prophecy and duels with Macbeth. Whilst fighting, Macbeth is confident, as ""no man born of woman"" can kill him. However, Macduff states he was ripped from his mother's womb and, when Macbeth is distracted, stabs him. Macbeth regrets his mistakes, knowing redemption is impossible. Macbeth refuses to bow before Malcolm, allowing himself to be killed. Malcolm is hailed King, while Fleance takes Macbeth's sword and charges through the empty battlefield, disappearing into smoke. Also starring Elizabeth Debicki as Lady Macduff, Maurice RoÃ«ves as Menteith, James Harkness as Angus, and Brian Nickels as Thane of Cawdor. Fassbender gives a mighty performance, Cotillard is equally good as his counterpart, and there is good support from Thewlis, Harris and Considine. This is probably the most masterful eerie interpretation of the ""Scottish play"", with many great visuals and it performed well, I will not pretend I understood absolutely everything going on because of its Shakespearean language, but I can see why critics give it high praise, it is an interesting historical drama. Good!"

" Intense, dark and beautiful
",0.6369,0.9943,2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"With the film-adaption of Shakespeare's tragedy ""Macbeth"" Justin Kurzel created an interesting and thrilling but also very dark and serious interpretation of the timeless play from the early 17th century.Macbeth tells the story of the brave Macbeth and his transition from a loyal, heroic general on the side of King Duncan to an unscroupulus tyrannt by killing his own king and ending up as a monster and maniac. It is about the question of guilt and abusion of power but also about the lack of morality.The film was directed by Justin Kurzel. He is mostly known for the Assassin's Creed movie which was not succesful at all. Michael Fassbender as the protagonist Macbeth is the highlight of the cast. He took part in several famous films like Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds or also in three X-Men movies in which he played the role of Magneto. King Duncan was played by David Thewlis who is famous for his role in the Harry Potter films and from ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjama"". But Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth suprised me the most because although she is a french actress I didn't even noticed it since her scotish accent is on point and her acting is outstanding.As I mentioned at the beginning, this adaption is more serious and more brutal than the play. The film also has some minor changes and I think the most important one is the fact that Macbeth has children in this version. This changes the view on him as a character since even though he knows how it feels like to loose his own children he still doesn't hold back from doing certain bad things throughout the story. Personally I think it was a good decision as it shows Macbeths inner monstrosity more clearly. While Macbeth was portrayed more terrible, Lady Macbeth was more humanized. When I read the play, I thought that Lady Macbeth is the pure evil and the main villain of the story. After I watched the movie, I sometimes even felt sorry for her because of her uncontrollable and totally crazy husband. There were some other minor changes like the appearance of the witches which were portrayed as some mysterious but still humanly women. And I think also this desicion was more adequate because the imagination of the witches how they were described in the play would mostly fit in a childrens book in these days.The by far best aspect of the film is the visual presentation. Adam Arkapaw as the cameraman created one of the most incredible shots and camera movements I have seen in a film. Especially the battle at the beginning and the very last scene were impressive and throughout the whole film this man worked perfectly with colors and angles. I even could have watched it without any sound. Speaking about sound, the dialogues were terrible. And I don't mean the lines themselves but the way they say them. I literally could only understand a little since they only mumbled and whispered and shouted. That combined with the scotish accent and the shakespearean language created a indefinable salad of words and sounds for my ears. I would recommend everyone to read the play parallel to the film in order to understand the plot.Overall I really liked and enjoyed the film. The actors were very good and I could sympathize with them thanks to their acting. The changes the director made made sense and even improved the story in certain ways. I love the camera settings and I hate the sound settings. So all in all I will give the adaption of Macbeth a 8/10."
" What did he say?
",0.0,-0.8648,2020-11-22 00:00:00,5,"Count me among those who have already noted that this film is seriously hampered by a very difficult to understand sound track. For some very strange reason the actors are directed to speak in stage whispers, or whispers, in nearly every scene. Even during battle, and hand to hand combat, the actors whisper to each other. A lot of the film has voice overs and, you guessed it, all delivered in a stage whisper. The film boasts great sets, very moody cinematography, and a team of actors that are game and up to the demands of the Shakespearean dialogue, yet all is marred by relentlessly irritating dialogue that is mumbled, muffled, and mostly unintelligible. What a shame it is given all the other attributes this film has going for it, to say nothing of a script by Shakespeare! The blame must lie at the feet of the director, Justin Kurzel. For this mortal flaw, I give the film 5/10."
" You might get very lost
",-0.3804,0.9914,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"I've never been much of a fan of Shakespeare, but then I haven't read or seen any of it since I last studied English literature about four years ago, so I'm willing to assume for now that it's because I couldn't understand what anyone was saying half the time.However, I have a bit of a soft spot for Macbeth, because for me, it was the obligatory Shakespeare play everyone in England has to study at least one of in their GCSE's, And at that point, understanding what everyone was saying was kind of essential, so our teacher actually bothered to explain it. And this had also just come out at the start of the school year, so we had a school trip to see it.All I really remember thinking about it at the time is that it was giving my eyes heaven, and that still holds true, this film is freaking gorgeous. That's easily the best thing about it, along with the soundtrack, because everything else is just fine to me.For a story that's probably over 400 years old, they really didn't change...well, anything. Like, nothing at all. Which kind of sucks because other than the cinematography, there's nothing all that special here. All the performances are good, don't get me wrong, but they don't add anything new to this story that's been told and retold and retold again and redone and revamped and remodeled and just generally ""re""-d for four centuries, so it feels a little unnecessary.This is in addition to the fact that the script is more or less completely faithful to the play as well, so yep, everyone talks in old English that you have a more than decent chance of being completely left in the dust by, and I'm not sure if the only reason I wasn't was because I've read and analysed those monologues again and again and again in the past.I'd never say the core story of Macbeth is bad, because that's just ludicrous, it's survived this long for a reason, but the occasional monologue or piece of dialogue does sound far too over-dramatic these days, and even if it didn't, I'll say it again: it's been four hundred years since this was written, and adding nothing but a new opening scene that shows Macbeth having a child that died in infancy that ultimately changes nothing in the rest of the film is not going to wow me very much.If you're a huge Shakespeare nut, then you might appreciate having an adaptation as faithful as this, assuming that none of the other ones are to such an extent, but for me, while I enjoyed the nostalgia, I don't think I'm ever going to watch it again."
" ""I am in blood, stepped in so far""
",0.0,0.9978,2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"Was actually really looking forward to seeing this 2015 film version of 'Macbeth'. The play is one of Shakespeare's best, most famous and most quotable and has leant itself to film, with Roman Polanski, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa all giving it splendid treatment. The cast is a talented one, having often admired Michael Fassbender, Marion Cottilard and David Thewlis and ever since seeing him in 'The Borgias' Sean Harris struck me as one to watch.Not to mention the great reviews. Was a little worried though too, seeing that it was directed by Justin Kurzel who directed the big misfire and huge waste of potential that was 'Assassins Creed'. Luckily, this 'Macbeth' lived up to expectations on the whole if not exceeding them. It is not the definitive version of the play, either on film or filmed production, and did have room for improvement, but for all its flaws the film on the whole surprisingly impressed me.This 'Macbeth' isn't perfect. It is agreed not always easy to understand the dialogue, which didn't need to be as hushed or as muttered. While the film a vast majority of the time looked absolutely great, there is a gratuitous overuse of slow-motion.Especially in the first 10 minutes or so, which were more sluggish than arresting. There are cuts and some of the omissions do affect the drama where the storytelling becomes less coherent.For all those drawbacks, there are a lot of positives with this 'Macbeth'. Other than the slow motion, it is quite an amazing looking film, with hugely atmospheric and grandiose visuals (from the suitably myterious fog early on right up to the boldly bloodthirsty climax). The photography to me was some of the best of that year, especially in the act and those locations are hugely effective in their atmosphere, uncompromising but also oddly beautiful and dark without taking it to extremes. The music is still haunting and Kurzel's direction is bolder and less muddled than it was in 'Assassins Creed' from the following year.Moreover, although it would have been nice if it was more consistently intelligible, Shakespeare's text is still powerful and hard to forget. The story takes time to get going but does get more compelling and remarkably ambitious, at its most emotionally investable from the point where Macduff learning of his family's murder (which has always been a very moving part of the plot) up to the end. The action is both exciting and ferociously harrowing, pulling no punches without being too unnecessarily over the top (seeing as 'Macbeth' is already a dramatically brutal play).Some interesting changes here. Really did like that the witches weren't portrayed in a way that was too reliant on witch cliches, and were spooky underneath their deceptive exteriors. Lady Macbeth is still an effective and steely manipulator but it was interesting to see a more conflicted side to her (very different as it is not what the play indicates) rather than her being completely villainous. This is not going to work for some, but to me it was interesting. The performances were on the whole great from all, Fassbender is searingly fierce in the title role without being too brutish and Cotillard contrasts with him effectively as a steely and imperious Lady Macbeth. Paddy Considine's Banquo is suitably noble and Harris proved in 'The Borgias' that he could do creepy but also tortured, and he is very moving here as Macduff. It is somewhat sad that Duncan's role in the play is not bigger because Thewlis, while perhaps a touch young, commands the part extremely well.In conclusion, intriguing and well done but there are better versions of 'Macbeth' around. 7/10"
" A mad Fassbender, a mesmerising Cotillard, beautiful visuals, great costume design. What's not
",0.7003,0.9934,2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"One of many Macbeths, but a special one. It's strange why it didn't get more buzz in the theatres, but the dialect was hard even for me. Needed English subtitles, and this because it's a great film. Great choice of locations and wonderful cinematography. The interpretation of Lady Macbeth and the looniness of Macbeth is wonderful and fully justified. A joker like Fassbender was a wonderful choice - amazing film!"
" Macbeth has PTSD?
",0.0,0.228,2020-07-31 00:00:00,4,"This movie is beautiful. It is wonderfully acted. The music is vast and epic. The story is terrible. In general, I like when a story is reimagined. This reimagining, however, makes this story hollow and alien. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's personalities are reversed and the justification for the story is translated into a mental illness. These changes just made the story incomprehensible and trivial to me. So disappointing."
" Had to use subtitles
",0.0,0.2023,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Fassbender was excellent. Broody, ambitious yet tortured in the gloomy landscape; it's Scotland after all. I had to use subtitles because not only was everyone spouting Shakespeare but they were speaking Scottish too."
" Started with a 10, down to a 6
",0.0,0.9698,2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,"I have probably watched 10 different MacBeths in my life, ranging from the Playboy Productions one which smacked of Sam Peckinpah's influence on goriness, thru plodding attempts to ""adapt"" the play to different times, nations, and even non nations, to honest attempts to tell the rather gigantic story. Patrick Stewart's was sort of wonderful, but, my God, 20th century Russians? Am I taking crazy pills? ""have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner?""
ANYWAY, THIS performance starts off with sheer elegance, actors actually taking time with their lines, the historical context perfectly re-created...and then the vision begins to waste away. By the end of the play, the director/or writer's pyromania literally replaces facts in the original Work. Why? It just comes off as narcissism. The killing of MacDuff's wife and young children by burning is, well, kinda sick, since it was not even IN the original. And acting like burning embers flying around are the equivalent of carrying tree limbs as camo is downright ludicrous. Now, you have to understand that MacBeth is a much bigger play than can comfortably be performed in 3 hours, and this movie is 113 minutes. Edits are inevitable. But we were hoping common sense was inevitable, too. This is not a comic book, guys!
This is effing Shakespeare!"
" Beautiful, brazen and atmospheric
",0.5994,0.9275,2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,The cinematography was excellent and I wasn't surprised to see it had won an award for it. Fassbender was great as the maddened and mental Macbeth. The music knew when to stop and when to play to create an aire of atmosphere of any kind. The cinematography and costume design sucked you in as if you were there you I the rugged Scotland. Watched many times and the only complaint is the audio could be better but subtitles fix that totally. Acting was good except maybe from lady Macbeth who's acting sometimes took me out of the moment but the opening scene is cinematic magic.
" Not enjoyable
",-0.3412,0.5989,2020-03-21 00:00:00,6,"So true to the actual text, this was a harsh reminder of how difficult and almost unfathomable Shakespearean English was for me. I had thought it would be an intelligible modern English adaptation, like history movies, as it were, but it turned out to be akin to an actual play on tape."
" Difficult
",-0.3612,0.8032,2020-02-27 00:00:00,3,"I think that this movie portrays the original text quite well, but that does not mean it is a good movie. My major problem with this film is that it keeps the original dialogue from the play, which makes for a completely unbearable experience. It was impossible to understand what the characters were saying to each other in some scenes, and I had to watch it with subtitles in order to understand it at all. The only reason I understood the story was because I had already read Macbeth, and even then, the differences in the movie sometimes made it hard to tell where the story was. The movie itself wasn't so bad, although the acting was made worse by the old English. But it was hard to watch when comparing it to the book."
" An excellent adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most legendary works
",0.5719,-0.9231,2020-02-21 00:00:00,9,"This adaptation is a very accurate representation and depiction of 'Macbeth.' This film ties a critical loose end that the original work failed to. The movie continues the character progression of Fleance by including him in the very last scene. This ties up the loose end of Banquo's sons becoming kings. Also, the film very accurately portrays the setting that the story of 'Macbeth' takes place in. The movie is filled with beautiful cinematic shots of the Scottish highlands. Additionally, the film precisely depicts the intense, raw violence of middle age battle. However, the film inaccurately exaggerated the intimacy between Lady Macbeth and Macbeth. And also fails to include some little things that occurred in the original, like the role of Hecate, Lady Macbeth's suicide, and the presence of Siward and young Siward."
" Beautiful shots, awkward dialogue, good ending
",0.7351,0.9651,2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"The costumes, dramatic shots, and sets were all incredible. From an artistic standpoint, the movie is perfect. The movie put an emphasis on the battle scenes in the beginning and end of the movie, something different from the play. This allowed for amazing action shots, especially with the fire at the end. It also captures Macbeth's raw emotions and loneliness with the landscape shots as he rides off.However, like with almost every movie retelling of a Shakespeare play, the dialogue was just awkward at times. The acting was good, but it was hard to appreciate through some of the uncomfortable scenes. The strangest one was probably Macbeth's reaction to his wife's death.The ending made up for anything awkward in the movie. While I would've liked to see this movie's take on ""Burnham woods come to Dunsinane"", the way the battle was shot was creative and unique. The best part of the ending was probably Fleance's return. It was a great spin on the play's ending, while still leaving it open to the viewer's imagination."
" Great Cinematography, A Tidily Bit Dark
",0.6249,0.9501,2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"While watching the film I was impressed to see what director, Justin Kurzel, was able to do with the beautiful yet tragic story of Macbeth. Director of Cinematography, Adam Arkapaw, was able to make so many innovational shots of the characters and was able to manipulate the tremendous geography of England and Scotland to his benefit. Through different shots and angles, Arkapaw was able to really bring out the intended intense emotion of Macbeth.Throughout the entire film, the acting of all was truly riveting. The way that all of the actors portrayed the Shakespearean characters really drew me into the plot. One thing I would recommend would be turning up the brightness a little. If you are not watching in a pitch black room, you are not likely to see all details. Overall.... 8/10, not too bad, definitely worth the watch."
" Macbeth Movie Vs. Macbeth Play
",0.34,0.2263,2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"In the play of Macbeth the witches are in the first scene and you hear from them first. The movie the first scene is Macbeth and Lady Macbeths dead sons burial. The witches are also portrayed as nasty creatures with beards and they are just gross but in the movie they are fairly clean and don't have beards. In the movie the witches are also dressed fairly well, wearing dark dresses. The witches also appear in the background of the movie when the prophecy were coming true but that never happened in the play. Hecate didn't say anything in the movie but in the play she had some lines. The endings where different as well. In the end of the movie a loose end that Shakespeare left out of the play was tied up in the movie. Fleance returns after Macbeth was killed and takes the sward that was sticking out of the ground. So Fleance was able to escape the murders."
" Very solid adaptation
",0.2247,0.9746,2020-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Macbeth was overall a well-rounded film. It was a wholesome adaptation with some additions to the Shakespearean version, wanted and unwanted. The film was shot beautifully and features some really incredible acting. Although, the mumbly shakespearean language warranted the captions being turned on. It was hard to understand at parts for sure. Some of these changes include: Macbeth and Lady Macbeth having some intimate scenes. Personally, I felt this was a bit unnecessary, but it better represented their relationship as in the play they feel just like business partners. At the end, Lady Macbeth never actually kills herself. There is just an allusion to her dying. I feel like this takes away from the drama of the situation, and her actually committing suicide is a representation of how crazy she has gone. A good change: at the end after Macbeth is killed by Macduff, Fleance returns and takes Macbeth's sword and starts running. Malcom is also seen not putting on the king's crown at the castle. I feel like this tied up the loose end of the prophecy of Banquo's sons being king. It tied it up really well and in a cool way. Otherwise, the plot was pretty consistent with the original, including scenes like Macbeth seeing the ghost of Banquo at the royal banquet (a pretty painful scene to watch). Overall, if you are a fan of Shakespear, I highly reccomend watching this movie!"
" Intense
",0.0772,0.9606,2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,"This adaptation of Macbeth was most definitely different than the written version, however, I like this. I find it intersesting when movies and books have their differences. This causes more suspense and almost good confusion. For example, I enjoyed the small changes like Fleance returning, Lady Macbeths death left somewhat open ended, the question of how motivated Malcolm is to become king, and also the surprising funeral and the Macbeth's child. These changes cause there to be enough change to make the movie more gripping and suspensful, but not too much where you don't know what is going on anymore. I enjoyed the movie more than the book because of these changes and the artistic nature and detail the movie depicted that the book lacked. Obviously there is much a movie can show that a book can't, which also contributes to my liking of the movie over the book. The movie held me in and made me want to actually see what was going to happen next, which was much more thrilling than anything the book had to offer."
" it was ok, not great.
",-0.2718,-0.8548,2020-02-20 00:00:00,4,"This representation of the play in this movie is somewhat accurate. The modern take on the story improves upon the story a little but not a whole lot. It added more loose ends with the fleance scene at the end. Which I personally did not like. It was hard to understand the dialogue as there was constant whispering and mumbling. It was beautifully shot, like the scene in the mountains was very beautiful. and the scene after macbeth sends the murderers to kill banquo and fleance. It was an ""ok"" movie."

Fortunately, this version of Macbeth provides what no theatrical production ever could: top-notch cinematography. Above all, the viewer is treated with gorgeous images of the barren, forbidding Scottish landscape. I also thought that the acting was quite good, by everyone involved, from the witches to Macbeth to Macduff to Lady Macbeth and everyone in between.I am not sure why this film has a lower rating at imdb than many easily forgettable movies devoid of anything but brash spectacle and with no real reason to exist. I do see that some people are complaining about the charactersÂ´ enunciation. Having watched this on Prime video with the subtitles on, I always knew exactly what everyone was saying.

To think they expected an action packed Hollywood action film with modern language would be developed from Shakespeare is like turning Thomas the Tank Engine into Thomas Pink Convertable. Of course this could be done in Hollywood, but it would be a comedy.
This is a 'tragedy' and once that's realised, the mood of the play will be understood.
I have never had a problem with understanding Shakespeare and have always appreciated and found it challenging to read into its meaning.
The movie is fabulous and should be looked at what it represents and for what it is and not for what people think it should be.
Others have appreciated it and if there were problems with understanding, they turned on the subtitles... even then you will need to read deeper to understand their words in modern English.
The acting is superb, cinematography excellent.
Well worth the watch and if not familiar with the play, just read up on this tragedy first, as you will then appreciate this movie. Well done."

In fact, This movie is very underrated! Cotillard and Fassbender should have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress last Oscars 2016.
Shakespeare's work often has a gritty, sweaty, imperfect, humanistic slant to it, but the film adaptations are so often pristine and elegant. Love to see adaptations like this..
We all actually felt pity for Macbeth at the end, he realised that he was wrong, Fassbender really conveyed a broken man realising his errors and accepting his fate"
" Dark and Powerful
",0.4215,0.9041,2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Macbeth (2015) is a film that expands upon the brilliance of the original Shakespeare in ways that were impossible during the Bard's time. The performances by Fassbender and Cotillard add subtexts upon subtexts to the two primary characters. What is vaguely assumed in between the lines and paragraphs of the written play is made palpable by a look, a grimace, or a tear. The characters of Macbeth are complex above all else-- a complexity wholly explored by the two leads.The greatest praise I can give this movie is that it expands upon the source material by using the medium of film to its fullest and most beautiful extent. The cinematography should be respected and awed at in the same way Blade Runner 2049 is. The fiery glow of the wood burning across Scotland is fantastical, almost transportive for the viewer. It is truly breathtaking. The visual direction by Justin Kurzel is complementary to the turmoil of both the Scottish political landscape and the inner-eyes of the characters. Take, for example, the shot of Macbeth surrounded by the iron clad vehemence of the first battle. This shot perfectly demonstrates the brutality of the world and the unbending determination of Macbeth. This moment may be laboriously shown in a stage play, or meticulously depicted in the written form-- but the film is able to communicate this in a shot lasting only a few seconds. There are changes from the source material (the floating dagger most notably) that many found to be ""wrong"". I would argue that this change actually deepens Macbeth's character. Because the dagger is carried by a young boy that was killed in the first battle, we see another dimension of Macbeth. We see that he feels guilt for his shortcomings, his failures to those he was unable to protect. This aspect of the film heightens the ultimate irony of his character.Many reviewers found issue with this film for its dialogue. I, on the other hand, found no difficulty understanding every scene as long as the subtitles were on. I don't think it is fair to fault a film for being authentic in its accents and its prose. Yes, the dialogue is hard to understand for my American ears; but the subtitles did the trick quite well.If it were up to me, this film would have won the Oscar for cinematography and had been nominated for Direction, Editing, Male Lead, and Female Lead. I hope many in the coming years grow to appreciate this film for its performances, its direction, and its visual mastery."
" Makes Macbeth even more slow

All of the scenes stretched out really long for no reason, with countless long and establishing shots.This film is also way to dark and I don't mean the plot, no I think it is shot way to dark. Midway through the film in fact I started to wonder if the director even knew what shutter speed was as half the film was shot in extremely dark rooms with no light at all.If you're a fan of the Macbeth story and play I would skip this one but I would recommend the Japanese film Throne of blood which is an adaptation of Macbeth."

" Definitely not without flaw
",0.4019,0.7226,2019-05-23 00:00:00,7,"In many ways this is easily the best adaptation to Shakespeare's timeless play. The camera work is truly beautiful at moments, which is helped greatly by the geography of Scotland. The film has almost no reliance on CGI and what is used blends very well to the themes and surroundings. However Macbeth, like many other films adapted from written media, suffers from extensive pacing issues. Most scenes feel just a bit too long which, along with some not so praiseworthy acting, makes the film seem slower than it should be. Of Cause being based on a Shakespearean play you must make the scenes longer in order to fit in all the foreshadowing and metaphors however reaching a middle ground between pacing and metaphors would be much appreciated.In my opinion this is definitely worth watching especially if you are a fan of the original play, but it is not perfect and a better adaptation can still be made."

Absolutely loved everything, from cinematography, to score, to atmosphere, to god-level of acting you would expect from such a wonderful cast.

Almost 2 hours of Shakespear language badly played is a wound in the soul.There are NOTHING good to be said about this movie."
" hard to follow.....
",-0.1027,-0.9602,2019-02-07 00:00:00,4,"The cinematic version of Macbeth was an interesting take on the well known Shakespearean novel set in the middle ages in Scotland. I found the novel much more captivating than the movie take on the book. the movie was very difficult to follow and many pieces of the story felt out of place, as if we were waiting for something that never occurred. In this tragic story, they chose a color theme that was very gloomy that made some parts hard to see and in some scenes, other scenes included colors that were overwhelmingly bright and powerful. The movie almost seemed never ending and dramatic scenes were very drawn out and monotonous. the language used was at times hard to understand, so when watching the film, I would recommend using subtitles to help understand the meaning and the dialogue. although there were significant issues with the film, I would say that the setting of the movie was beautiful and the scenes were thoughtful. Overall, the acting and actors in the movie did a fine job representing and portraying the characters in the Macbeth novel and it was not a bad movie.
There was a significant amount of differences between the film and the book. One being the death of king Duncan. In the novel, Duncan is murdered by Macbeth, but no one ever finds out. To prevent being blamed for the murder, the kings 2 sons, Donalbain and Malcolm flee the country. In the movie, while slaughtering Duncan, Malcolm walks into the bloodbath to see his fathers dead body. Macbeth urges him to flee the country, so he does not get framed for the murder. The second difference is the witches, in the book the witches are represented as haggard, evil, tricky and not very humanlike. Whereas in the movie the witches have more human qualities and don't necessarily speak in riddles. Hecate who plays an important role in the book, is not even included in the film. Lastly, in the end of the movie, Fleance plays a big role. he is seen in the end of the movie returning from running away to most likely full-fill his prophecy to be the future king of Scotland. In the novel, he does not return after his father, Banquo demands for him to flee. there are many differentiations between the movie and the novel, which make the story different to interpret."
" Not much good to say...
",-0.3412,0.6295,2019-02-01 00:00:00,3,"This movie doesn't do Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" justice. The dialogue is a lot of mumbling, the storyline is almost impossible to follow, the things added to the movie that weren't in the original play don't make sense, and important scenes from the play were left out. The movie's attempts to add deep and meaningful scenes to dialogue usually lead to awkward moments with weird pauses in the dialogue. Towards the end of the movie, Fleance comes back to take a sword left on the battlefield as Macbeth, who wasn't beheaded as he was in the play, kneels on the battlefield. A reasonable assumption that could be made as to why Macduff doesn't decapitate Macbeth is to leave him so that when Fleance comes to the battlefield to retrieve the sword, he uses the sword to deal the final blow to Macbeth. However, instead, he runs off into the distance and the credits are rolled out. The biggest flaws from this movie are all the open ends that are left. Many important details were left out of the movie and new things were added without a reason being presented. Macbeth wasn't decapitated, the weird sisters wore normal clothing and do not match their description in the play, the weird sisters also had children with them, the weird sisters gave Macbeth one of the three prophecies when he returned to seek answers from them instead of all three coming from the apparitions, and the list goes on. The only saving grace of this movie were the beautiful battle scenes with lighting that made what would otherwise be a dismal heath, into a colorful scene that has a sense of wonder and magic to it."
" Mediocre Adaptation
",0.0,-0.91,2019-02-01 00:00:00,4,"This adaptation of Macbeth was mediocre at best. While I recognize some things are good to change between the play and the movie, some of the changes I felt were unnecessary. For example, the addition of a child accompanying the three witches served no purpose. Much of the dialogue was whispered and very quiet. Additionally, some lines were added from the play, which can be helpful to a movie, but it often felt very obvious when a line was added or whether Shakespeare wrote it, taking you out of the world of the movie. Lines were skipped around a lot as well, which I felt was not needed. Another change that was for the worse was Malcolm after Duncan's death. In the play, Malcolm flees because he fears for his life after the death of his father. In the movie, Malcolm flees because Macbeth directly threatens him. I feel that Macbeth threatening Malcolm just created a plot-hole that was not there before. Why, after the threat, did Malcolm not try to go to people that he felt he could trust? Overall, while most of the movie is true to the play, the changes that were made were did not add anything to the movie."
" Garbage
",0.0,0.0293,2019-02-01 00:00:00,3,"Never have I seen a film so average and lifeless that it made me angry. Shakespeare adaptions can range from absolutely fantastic to lackluster and this film unfortunately falls into the later. A big part of why the film fails for me at least is that I can feel as if it's trying too hard to be a good piece of art. Macbeth is a tragedy so obviously it's tone is dark. So in turn one might think that the color pallete of the film should reflect that. But what ends up happening is that the film gets this lifeless and dull look that doesn't leave a substantial lasting impression. They have a beautiful setting like Scotland and they manage to make it look grotesque. If a film has a more morbid tone, the color pallete doesn't necessarily need to reflect that.The performances range from substantial to lacking. Fossbender's performance is adequate but my biggest qualm with it is that he mumbles everything the entire film. Lady Macbeth is cold to the point where she leaves no lasting impression. A performance devoid of any emotion. As for everyone else, no one is memorable.Other minute things about the film really bother me. They might be hard for someone else to understand because my feelings are subjective but bear with me. All of the pinnacle scenes in the film manage to become underwhelming and as if they never even happened. The play really loses the epic feel that Shakespeare was able to convey in the play. Once the movies over your left with a feeling of being underwhelmed. The film doesn't feel theactrical."
" overly dramatic
",0.0,0.0865,2019-02-01 00:00:00,4,"The movie is true to Macbeth's script mostly, with the occasional relocation for the purpose of plot. A major difference is the ending; Fleance is shown to pick up the sword and run off, possibly suggesting another plot for power. At the end, the battle and then Macbeth's death are very extensive and bloody, as opposed to their counterpart in the book that is largely offstage. The witches also appear often, particularly when parts of the prophecy come into effect. It is a nice touch to ascertain that the audience recognizes these moments.
Although the movie is cinematic, the focus on that subtracts from its entertainment. The dialogue is largely whispering and mumbling, occasionally punctuated with forceful shouting. The scenes are dragged out with music and extended shots, making the movie seem tedious and slow. Overall, the movie felt like a chore to watch because aesthetics and dramatics were prioritized over the script and intense plot."
" A well-intentioned movie that misses the point
",-0.2263,-0.7849,2019-01-07 00:00:00,5,"For all the constant haunting violins, beautiful sunsets and striking landscapes shown in this film, it somehow completely misses the point of the story it adapts. I could accept a ""loose"" adaptation of MacBeth that skips about half of the play, modifies the order of scenes, combines other scenes together, gives lines said by one character to another character, and invents some plot points outright, if this retained the core of MacBeth, but this does not at all. Instead, Michael Fassbender mumbles and whisper-talks his way through a dull, practically wooden performance that strips MacBeth of what makes him an interesting character: his internal struggle where morality and reason fight against opportunism and ambition. The film is made like the director thinks MacBeth is nothing but a play about a violent guy and the various people who kills. I daresay if that's all MacBeth were, we wouldn't still be performing it 400 years after it was written. Instead of Shakespeare's beautiful poetry, the movie is drowned in over-art-directed vistas and just plain bad directoral choices (like setting the entire first 10 minutes of the film as a battle that is shot almost entirely in ludicrous slow motion--the kind of thing a first-year film student who has just seen ""300"" might think is a good idea).If you want to see MacBeth presented in a cinematic style rather than as a play, I suggest the far superior 1971 version by Roman Polanski."
" Incredibly Unique
",0.0,0.9736,2018-12-01 00:00:00,8,This version of Macbeth is is going to be shown in high schools for the next 20 years. Visually very pleasing and true to Shakespeare's play. I don't think it was received well in theatres because it's literally read like it just came out of a 10th grade English textbook. But there's no getting around that this is one of the prettiest movies I've ever seen. Casting was also spot on considering every second felt super spooky. I would recommend to a friend.

" Wrong, wrong, wrong!
",-0.8622,-0.8624,2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,"The power and the majesty of Shakespeare's plays is in the language. Why then produce a film version where the dialogue is muttered, uttered in a monotone, or pronounced in accents almost impenetrable, such that the viewer is struggling to catch even the most famous speeches?
The wonder of it is that there is anything left, but the heavy mood and horror of the tale does capture attention. The actors all have powerful presences and retain their dignity throughout the overdone face-smearing and dripping gore. I can only conclude that they did as they were directed. I was just longing for someone to break out, lift their voices, and utter their speeches in traditionally round, stentorian tones - I would have cheered. Failing this, there was nothing to lift the heart.
I can see that no expense was spared and it is in many ways a high class production. I just ask WHY it was done at all. Did the producers just trade on famous names (starting with Shakespeare), or see it as an opportunity for horror and violence? They obviously didn't value the play as such, as they didn't preserve much of what makes it great. I'm not a purist as regards the plays, but they do have a stage quality which is lost with too much ""realism"". Here the baby has gone out with the bathwater (or was it burned at the stake?)"
" Why?
",0.0,0.8779,2018-08-27 00:00:00,1,Why would somebody butcher such a beautiful masterpiece so callously? And maybe it's high time we accepted that Marion Cotillard is an overrated actress.
" Stylish and atmospheric take on a classic
",0.0,-0.9902,2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"This version of one of the greatest plays in the English language is worth seeing for the visuals alone. We're placed right into a medieval Scottish countryside with its strikingly beautiful landscapes, lochs, and mountains. That austere and foreboding setting underlies just about every scene. The three Weird Sisters (who look superficially like peasant women but convey a genuinely creepy otherness) stand in fog-shrouded fields as they utter their cryptic warnings and prophecies to Macbeth and lurk in the background off to the side of the battles. Hardscrabble peasants and soldiers dot the landscape, sometimes strangely motionless, sometimes lining the roads, but always enhancing an air of strangeness. Life is brutal, violent death is never far away, and the supernatural world is always just offstage.I won't worry about giving away spoilers here because this is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays, but if you haven't seen it before, then this is maybe not the best place to start. Two reasons: first, a lot of the text has been cut (even though the complete play is not that long) and it will help a lot if you already know the plot and characters. Otherwise, you might be lost not knowing who's doing what and to whom. I got the feeling that the director Justin Kurzel essentially assumes that his viewers will already know the play and are deliberately looking for a different, postmodern take on it. Second, most of the dialog is (appropriately enough) in thick Scottish accents but often almost whispered, as if the characters are speaking only to themselves or someone right beside them. In places it's hard to pick up. But this too adds to the atmosphere, as if the actors are standing outside themselves both watching and taking part.Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard make a first-rate pair of leads. David Thewlis (Duncan) and Elizabeth Debicki (Lady Macduff) are also notable, as are the three witches. The various captains and soldiers with speaking parts are hard to tell from each other, but that's another reason to know the play before going in. One added touch I thought was interesting came very early on where we see the Macbeths burying an infant daughter (who's only referred to obliquely in the play) and then losing a teenage son in battle. If they don't have their own children to live for, it maybe makes it easier to understand why they would go ahead and do what they do. Another effective touch, an interesting director's interpretation, is that Lady Macbeth slides over into madness specifically because of her husband's brutal murder of Macduff's family -- she was willing to push him into assassination as a career move but didn't bargain for what it led to, which was outright destruction even of women and children and a reign of blood. ""What's done cannot be undone.""See the full play in a live theater, somewhere, and then see this movie for its distinctive ambience. It's an added-value experience."
" All Hail Macbeth
",0.0772,0.9989,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"If you have ever seen a Shakespeare production, well good for you; but except for understanding the language, it does not prepare you for this ambitious Macbeth. I will include it in the first paragraph because it plays a role more important than any character, and that is our friend Atmosphere. This film utilizes what a stage production could never achieve, and it creates such a distinguished atmosphere.Say, Mr. Gill, what exactly do you mean by atmosphere? I'm talking about mood, I'm talking about tone, I'm talking about presentation! There is a lot of fog and mist to go around, and the camera hardly moves, painting picture-like shots of characters in front of a wide background. It's so visceral and bold and unexpected. Above all, it works. It fits the puzzle beautifully with the vision in-hand.There are plenty of smart choices, such as reducing the lines and spirit of the crazy 3 witches. Instead, they add such a mystical element that's almost taunting to the ticking and complex Macbeth. There's other noticeable changes, but before you traditionalists call foul, don't worry because it's not a change from the source like pre-good DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet is.Okay, the film is perhaps stylish to a fault. If you recall the iconic scene in Mission: Impossible where Tom Cruise sneaks into the white room, you will remember that any sound above a whisper would trigger the alarm. It felt like (with the exception of scenes like the haunting dinner) the entire cast was set to this mode. Although it adds a coolness to many of the lines, I kind of wanted to yell at the screen just to see if the characters would yell back. Oh, and I can't imagine watching the film without the use of subtitles. And on that note, I think every Shakespeare movie is probably enhanced with subtitles to help understand the lines and think them through more thoroughly.I don't think I have talked about makeup in movies as much as I should, so I will add it here. The battle makeup and makeup on Lady Macbeth stand out in a good way, and that is a big accomplishment to the people in that department.Now you just know I wouldn't do a review without mention of the acting. Hey, Harry Potter fans, Lupin is in this film! Okay okay, let's talk Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. Fassbender is a powerhouse actor, and I think a little more variation in voice would clean up one of Shakespeare's best characters. And one of Shakespeare's best female characters, if not the best, is played by the French Cotillard, an interesting differentiation from the rest of the Scots. Combine these two experienced actors with incredible lighting, and we're back to the atmosphere.I must say how I was engaged for the entire film. It's impossible not to give huge credit for this Shakespeare adaptation that perhaps stands out the most from any of the movies of any of the plays. And yeah, the fighting is like Zack Snyder, but with more purpose. I don't think the opening and ending sequences could have been done better, and for the squeamish, there is enough blood to quench a vampire; but as I stated earlier, it is more meaningful and again adds to the atmosphere. If there's any way to get millenials excited about what a dead guy wrote years ago, it is through this film. And that statement could easily have its downsides, but even the shall we say sophisticated can appreciate what is done. I'd say this film is like Zack Snyder meets Gladiator meets European art, and on most notes, that is pretty good praise.

It seemed to cut any scene that took away from the gritty darkness of the script, but a good tragedy doesn't need to omit funny moments to remain tragic. Michael Fassbender makes a wonderful Macbeth, beautifully showing a refreshingly raw and vulnerable side to him after he becomes king that we rarely see depicted. It really reminds us of who he once was and how much he has changed. This, in addition to a magnificent set, perfectly selected costume design, and good acting all around, makes Macbeth overall worth the watch.(I would recommend reading the original text first, but I understand that Shakespeare is not everyone's cup of tea.)"

" Tragedy
",-0.6597,-0.8829,2018-02-17 00:00:00,7,"It seems everybody forgot today what the real tragedy is. In conditions of eternal fear to consult anyone's feelings, the genre of clear tragedy vanishes completely. If only George Martin allows to himself to kill consistently several characters in his books, we can hear yellings like 'he is a slasher!' or 'he kills everybody!'. It's strange for me, as we do not mind of blood rivers and streams in Tarantino's movies. Maybe because it is funny', I guess.Let's refer to an encyclopedia: 'Tragedy - branch of drama that treats in a serious and dignified style the sorrowful or terrible events of private or a public character encountered or caused by a heroic individual and usually leads to the hero's death'. Some Shakespeare's plays are tragedies and they were and will be it, as you might want it or not. If the place and time of the action moved, the meaning will be not changed. As it is important to understand the Chekhov is the great playwright of dramas, the same time it is important to realize why Shakespeare is the great tragedian.If you are not afraid to wade through the wilds of Scottish English with its archaic words, if there is no fear in your brave heart of the Shakespeare's iamb, if you love Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in particular and British actors in general, so you have to watch this film."

Blood imagery, darkness, and a ghost if I recall my High School British Literature class of 1972.The Shakespearean masterpiece has been made into a modern action film, making me think this was one of the first cabin-in-the -woods slashers. I loved the acting, the cinematography (even when the sun was glaring on the lens) and the scenery. Marion Cotillard ending soliloquy had me lighting Bics and tossing Frisbees. She was that good. Fassbender did a heck of a job nailing a king crazed with guilt. The three ""witches"" from the play appear to be ""fates"" in the film which worked out nicely. Yes, much has been cut out.I was glued to the screen as I did not want to miss a word, because at times it was hard to understand what they were saying between accents and hithers. At times I felt I was watching art. I would be surprised if this was not nominated a number of Golden Globes or Oscars.Guide: No nudity. Clothed above the waist sex scene. IMDB claims there is absolutely no swearing...except for that one ""damn"" word. Now I did hear something that sounded like ""skull f--- me thunder.""

The highlight is without a doubt Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in their respective roles, the braveness and naivety conveyed by Fassbender from beginning to end is outstanding and we can see that he put a lot of work and thought in to this character. As for Cotillard, the rage and ambitiousness brought out from her is unique, spellbinding and an absolute spectacle to endure. However, I did find the plot failed to engage me and truly pull me in, it felt as if they were taking so much time trying to stay faithful to Shakespeare that they forget to make this story feel relevant and gratifying for an audience who might not be familiar with this material. It should have been made for a more universal audience. As well as that, a lot of the enotion felt forced, not by the actors, but from the direction, score, cinematography and so on. It felt like they were trying too hard to enforce this on us, rather than merely letting us merely get engrossed in to the drama from the performances, I understand that it is based on a play, but I thought it all could have been done with a little more subtlety. Not breathtaking, but very enjoyable. Great performances throughout, Macbeth is flawed, but I would recommend any fan of Shakespeare or these performers check it out, it is certainly worth your time.A man will stop at nothing to become king, while his wife enforces evil upon him. 
Best Performance: Marion Cotillard"
" I find it strange to see characters talking to them
",-0.2023,0.9393,2018-01-25 00:00:00,4,"It's a gimmicky film, which for my taste, has gone too far and has spoiled it. It is a serious movie but it falls.I do not think it's a bad movie, the truth is, the problem for my taste, is that when I first see Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard talking to themselves, well I do not believe it.In addition, at the beginning, he assembles a series of slow planes, which do not come to mind. That they do not count anything else for going in slow motion. They are not even pretty or spectacular. Ten minutes into the movie, like he will not let me in.The other actors are not bad, but with the protagonists they have already taken me out.Great production, therefore, great costumes, makeup and art.Management, very limited and planning nothing great.We reached the end and if the picture was quite good. The final part, although I imagine it was so red because of the blood, but I see it too gimmicky, I do not like it.I would see other versions.Spoiler:It is not good to compare with other versions, but in this case, it seems like sometimes, you have all the time in the world to tell the story and at other times, it seems that you are in a hurry, you are already in the middle of a scene, as when kill your friend, it's as if I've lost something. And when Marion is already dead. So suddenly, but how and when?"
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.8036,2018-01-06 00:00:00,4,"When undertaking a project like this, one needs to be extremely careful for, if it fails, it can do so pretty hard. Now, if you plan to make it misty, slow and theatrical, if the entire weight of the play is going to to lay on the work of the actors, please, do us a favour and go to the theatre to find them. Fassbender, is just not your man. I mean, he, sword in hand, can look quite impressive on the battlefield, but, foreground monologues... Not his thing. Really. On a positive note, often during the film he seems to forget and switches off the fake Scottish brogue."
" Every Frame a Painting
",0.0,0.9971,2017-12-15 00:00:00,8,"When I first watched this movie in my local cinema (which is where you should see it), I was definitely too tired. You really need to accept the slow pace of this movie. But watching it the second time on Blu-Ray at home, I really saw the genius of this movie. Firstly director Justin Kurzel did a great job in adapting this classic story in a modern way while staying 100% true to Shakespeare's original. Unlike any other of the Macbeth adaptations, he didn't change the setting. It's still set in 17th Century Scotland, or to be more precise: in the Scottish Highlands which brings me to the next point, the gorgeous cinematography.
From the moment I first saw the trailer, I wanted to see this movie just because of the images. Adam Arkapaw achieves to create paintings with every frame, paintings you could hang up both in your living room and in museums. He's a true master of his craft (also made True Detective Season 1 and Assassin's Creed). And this is also the reason why you shouldn't wait to head to your local cinema if they coincidentally show it. This is really the best way to enjoy those images. If not you should definitely try to find the biggest screen possible, don't just watch this on your laptop or even your phone.
The music, composed by Justin's brother Jed Kurzel, is also very good and always on point.
Acting is also great, especially Marion Cotillard does a great job playing Lady Macbeth.
Watch this movie, it's worth it!Ps.: Turning the subtitles on might be useful."
" The finest film iteration ever created for Macbeth
",0.25,-0.1793,2017-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Period.Word for word accurate from the original text.This film and those portraying these famous figures of Shakespeare, the ambiance, atmosphere, all could not be better represented.Beautiful and magnificent.Such a shame rubbish like these comic book movies make such a fortune where this did not even break even..TRAGIC."
" A Beautiful Atmosphere
",0.5994,0.9872,2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"""Macbeth"" is a modern adaption of the classic play by William Shakespeare. It takes over the well known story and enriches it with modern ways of production and technical possibilities.It is remarkable, what beautiful pictures this adaption delivers. It creates a very fitting mood that make the play believable and give it a rather dark and sinister tone. It sticks to the classical language, which, at times, can make it quite hard to follow the plot because it creates a rather bumpy flow but still it is surprising how well the theme of Macbeth still works centuries after its imagination. Additionally, the production manages to stay credible and avoid to make the film look like any cheap play you might have seen before.All in all I liked this movie pretty much even though at some times I would have wished for a more easy access concerning the big material it deals with. Still, the pictures alone are worth giving this one a try. If you can watch it on a big screen, I could imagine that it works out even better."
" They just had to go their own way at the end....
",0.0,-0.9485,2017-09-16 00:00:00,8,"So disappointing. I loved it all the way to the end, until the filmmakers just had to go a completely different way with their ending. IT REALLY MAKES ME MAD WHEN THEY DO THAT! WHY? WHY DID THEY DO IT?! It's stupid! People are gonna go into this film, especially the ones that know the story of Macbeth are going to be disappointed at the end of the film! Stupid!"
" Hella chills
",0.0,0.9894,2017-09-05 00:00:00,8,"OKAY, WOW! Not to be super mean, but the first review of this movie really is deceptive! I loved this movie and am a huge fan of Macbeth so I would not say that lightly! Please take the time to watch and form your own opinions on the film!I loved the way the cast (Macbeth/ Lady MacBeth) spoke! Although it was in old Shakespearian it flowed beautifully! Lady Macbeth's (adapted) ""monologue"" chilled me to the bone, in the best way. I already knew what was going to happen and it still surprised me! Just watch and decide for yourself before you listen to puffed up movie critics!"
" Great atmospherics, but no poetry!
",-0.1386,-0.7214,2017-09-03 00:00:00,4,"When staging Shakespeare for the cinema, directors have two obvious choices: one, to go with a straightforward theatrical production, and the other, to use the play as the starting material for a screenplay conceived for the purpose. In this version of 'Macbeth', Justin Kurzel clearly takes the second approach. He certainly gets the atmospherics right, and Michael Fassbinder is exactly the sort of actor you would think would be able to make the title role his own. What is lost, however, is the poetry, speeches are mumbled rather than disclaimed, and you might hardly recognise that this was a play written in verse. To me, the result is simply rather dull, and quite possible, hard to follow if you didn't already know the story (though for some reason, the minor detail relating to the prophesy about Macbeth's killer - that he would not be of ""woman born"" - seems to be repeated dozens of times). It's true, writing plays in verse is an outdated convention - but the reason we still watch Shakespeare is because he was so damn good at it, and what's left once that is abandoned is not nearly as interesting. I'd recommend the version with Patrick Stewart from a few years back, no less intense, but much more Shakespearian."
" Too many slow motion, whisper and mumbling
",0.0,-0.1078,2017-07-15 00:00:00,4,"""Star hide my fire, Let no light to see my back and deep desires."" My favor quote from Macbeth.I would say I am very disappoint to this movie, prefer the old version better. Turn it off after 20 minutes. Too many slow motion, whisper and mumbling, made it so difficult to normal people to understand. Macbeth's original form is a stage show, but movie is a reversion, an art transform. The lines are still writing so outdated? So why don't I just read a book instead to watch a movie? By the way, nice photographing MTV movie. But I am not a fan to slow motion."
" Worth watching.
",0.2263,0.91,2017-07-13 00:00:00,4,Marion Cotillard is Lady Macbeth. The rest is acting and cinematography. Ms Cotillard needs to find roles that allow her to be part of the whole rather than be a brilliant light in a paleness. Then again I just watch films and get what I get from them. I hope Ms Cotillard can retain the brilliance and not be submerged in the industry.
" So its come to this.
",0.0,0.9621,2017-04-04 00:00:00,4,"I thought that on a personal level I would never subject myself to the oppression of the mind that criticism lends but here I am, my hand forced after bearing witness to this DETACHED ADAPTATION. I must say first that to ATTEMPT to modernize Shakespeare and make it appear more natural by completely reducing it to a secular rhythm, an almost monotone slow beating of the drum, an ever-present whisper, misses the mark entirely. In fact it does the complete opposite of creating realism, it lends itself to the present visual shine and tepid cinematic climate of today's artistic oppression. YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE Shakespeare MODERN AND ACCESSIBLE to today's world by removing its poetic rhythm (designed for the stage). Yet somewhere you decided to reduce it to a whisper and thus striped it of its emotional integrity. Maybe because the traditional plays are spoken loud with such great volume the director felt in order to separate from tradition you must go in completely the opposite direction. I don't know but if that was the intent you should have known better."
" No Fun To Watch.
",0.2732,0.8522,2017-01-20 00:00:00,4,"Between the soldier's light quilted armor sewn perfectly with a machine, the symmetrical cross gable roof on the Church built with dimensional lumber not introduced until the 1800's, the phony modern Scot's accent (in the 11th century who knows how they spoke. Not English certainly.) the ""fingernails on the chalkboard"" music mixed far too loudly and the the whispering voices mixed far too quietly, the net result was that the movie was just simply a mess. Pretty cinematography. Good acting (probably should have acted with a made-up language and subtitles. Pig Latin maybe. Moe: Omay. Larry: Arrylay. Curley: Curleycue, Nyuk Nyuk). Silent would have been the best. We quit about halfway through in in total frustration. Not recommended."
" Good But Hard To Understand The Dialogue
",0.09,-0.9319,2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard play Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, respectively; a power hungry couple who decide to assassinate their king so that Fassbender will usurp the throne. The funny thing isÂFassbender knows that his treachery will bring serious blowback to himself, but Cotillard spurs him on. After their traitorous deeds are done, and Fassbender and Cotillard are king and queen of Scotland, paranoia and madness sets in the mind of Fassbender, leading him to murder men, women, and children so that he may keep his fragile grip on the throne. But a vengeful husband and father comes with ten thousand soldiers to put an end to Fassbender's tyranny, and Fassbender will have to answer for all the blood that he has spilled. ""Macbeth"" is overly stylish to the point of distraction; but the performances of the main characters are top-notch (although the combination of accent and an ancient way of speaking makes it difficult to understand what is being said). My most memorable, movie moment of ""Macbeth"" is the scene when Fassbender burns a woman and her children alive because he believes they will oppose him in the future.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
