" Easily the worst of the first three
",-0.4019,0.6549,2021-02-20 00:00:00,3,"The second was the best in my opinion, this one was below average. The jump scares are easy to predict. The most is not even scary, it borders on funny because it's actually trying to be scary. It lost a star for showing a pyramid with an 'all seeing eye' about 30 minutes into the movie (Lin Shaye's 'Book of Seeing'). Tired of seeing references to that weird crap."
" Scary
",-0.4939,-0.9063,2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Insidious 3 is the new chapter of the terrifying horror series, written and directed by Leigh Whannell. This prequel, set before the haunting of the Lambert family, reveals how gifted psychic Elise Rainier reluctantly agrees to use her ability to contact the dead in order to help a teenage girl who has been targeted by a dangerous supernatural entity. The movie wants to terrify you and make your heart beat fast; it does that really effectively with several serious jumps. Shame about a scene near the end that is too exaggerated. However Insidious Chapter 3 does a great job and it is the most dark, and creepy instalment of the series.

" Tedious and unnecessary prequel
",0.0,0.8934,2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I recently got around to binge watching all the Insidious films and surprisingly, I quite liked the first 2 movies, which put together a pretty emotional, clever and satisfying story. Not the best horror of the decade (that honor goes to the first Conjuring and Split), but certainly nowhere near the worst. But there's really no reason to continue these movies after Parts 1 and 2. First, the reason why the first 2 movies worked was because of the focus on the Lambert family. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey and the actors playing the kids were all really strong and held those movies together. These paranormal investigators Elise and her 2 comic relief cohorts were just along for the ride. I didn't find these 3 characters especially interesting or deep, yet these prequels focus on their exploits. Lin Shaye (as Elise) says her lines in annoying monotone. I barely buy her as an actual person, much less an expert in exorcising demons. Her co-stars Leigh Whannell (also the film's director who plays Specs) and Angus Sampson (who plays Tucker) play absolute blank slate characters. Specs literally does nothing important and Tucker has the personality of a fruit fly. And that mohawk looks dumb on him. In The Conjuring, the Warrens were as much (or more so) the stars of the film as the family they were helping, but in Insidious, the investigators were just the standard, quirky, disposable characters. The Insidious filmmakers basically took the random 1-dimensional comic relief characters from the first film and built a whole franchise around their adventures.The story in this 3rd movie, and 1st prequel, is cliche. This random college girl who aspires to be an actress has an annoying little brother (who looks nothing like her) and raised by their widowed father and she lost her mother a year prior to the events of this film. Why are modern horror movies so obsessed with single parent families where one, usually the Mom, has died? Weird trend. Random girl has her cliche wisecracking best friend and cliche boy-next-door who has a crush on her and also there's the weird neighbor suffering from dementia where that somehow gives her the ability to communicate with the dead. Wash, rinse, repeat. Enter our 3 ""heroes"" from the first two much better movies, except this version feels more watered down to the family featuring much less talented actors. The fact that Dermot Mulroney (the widower Dad) is the best and most recognizable actor of the lot pretty much spells doom. Cue the boring story about a long deceased tenant who used to occupy the apartment above the family in the rundown complex and so he decides to haunt them because he has unfinished business and somehow the girl's late mother comes in at the 11th hour to save the day. That's pretty much the plot. Also the girl for some inexplicable reason gets is run over by a car early in the movie and must be bedridden for most it, but that really has nothing to do with anything. Now I know the reason why I waited so long to watch this franchise and having seen all 4 movies, glad I don't have to re-visit them."

" Gripping, Haunting, Creepy, Tense.
",-0.5423,0.646,2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"The Most Sentimental Horror Movie I've Ever Seen
Without a doubt, this movie is the king of all the Insidious movies. I feel like this is undoubtedly due to the fact that it makes you all at once feel horrified and sad, while also having mild undercurrents of comedic relief. This movie has way more substance than all the others in the franchise. For instance, I actually felt a connection to the characters in this movie. The tension between the father and daughter was so intense that it was palpable. I found myself feeling sorry for the father for having to carry such an emotional burden while also feeling bad for the daughter for basically having to take on the maternal role in the household. I can honestly say that the first two movies didn't do that great of a job at making me feel any emotions resembling sympathy toward the protagonists.My favorite part about this movie was that it really tugged at the old heart strings. As one having dealt with the loss of many loved ones over time, I understand the deep desire to reach out to them from beyond the grave. Somehow the subject of a teenage girl wanting to contact her deceased mother made the old wounds of my own personal losses feel fresh. Toward the end of the movie, I found my eyes welling up with tears. I can honestly say walking out of the theater, I felt like it was a great ten bucks spent."
" Vast improvement over the previous 2, felt like a horror movie this time.
",0.2023,0.9489,2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Unlike the previous 2, this definitely felt like a horror movie. It was really good as well, 4 of the jump scares got me.The ghosts felt a lot more creepy looking and acted that way as well, there was one funny moment but I wasn't laugh at how bad the ghost designs were, unlike the first 2.The lead actress getting his by the car, came out of nowhere it just left my jaw hanging. The James Wan cameo was a nice touch as well, Leigh Whannell definitely has a flair for horror, I look forward to what he does next.So yeah I loved every moment of this, even though it's a prequal I think it's better than the previous 2 installments. All the references and callbacks weren't forced in either, they added another dimension to the movie. Loved seeing the bride getting her ass kicked by Lin Shaye, she nutted her it was bloody amazing."
" The weakest one yet
",-0.5106,0.8606,2020-10-24 00:00:00,5,"As the director tries to make the film more disturbing, all it comes off is as a weaker instalment compared to the first 2. The first 2 had an interesting story to carry them through but this one is so formulaic that I felt I was in an intro class to film.
The ending made no sense either in the sense that here is a ""dark, scary movie"" but the final scene feels like a Disney/Nickelodeon tv show. Everyone is smiling and joyful as they practically skip along the road like a weird Wizard of Oz. I know that they wanted to focus on Elise for this and the final film but it felt weird to go back a few years from the first 2 films to start prequel/origin story.
Hopefully the final film in the 4 part franchise will be better. This was just not that good."
" Creepy movie

" A Very Good Prequel/Sequel
",0.4927,0.9939,2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,"Incredibly atmospheric, well-directed, and with some rather good performances- Insidious: Chapter 3 can be weighed down by its jump scares, which happen often enough to be a problem, but is an incredibly creepy and provocative thriller that is a much better sequel (or prequel) to the original film than the last one. The film is directed and written by star of the Insidious franchise, and Upgrade and Invisible Man director Leigh Whannell. There are definitely some well-written moments throughout the film, that both exhibit strong amounts of emotion and some thought-provoking situations on how the characters are affected by these sorts of phenomenons. However, Whannell proves himself to be a better director than a writer, mainly due to the fact of the film never quite reaching the potential it sets out to accomplish. Its approach to telling the story isn't formulaic necessarily, but very by the numbers, which seems odd regarding what the film is dealing with, and how the other films have contained themselves. Whannell's partial lack of writing skills is made up for, somewhat, in the film due to the rich atmosphere it presents, as well as a claustrophobic nature, and a terrific look all the way throughout. The cinematography is great, and the acting has its fair turn of standouts this time around, with Stefanie Scott and Lin Shaye providing the film's best performances. Its jump scares can be more of an annoyance at times than anything special, but the film has just enough suspenseful scenes and scares to keep anyone entertained, despite its somewhat slow but interesting start. In the end, Insidious Chapter 3 does improve upon the second film. Although it doesn't quite conjure up as many scares as the original, the third entry in this franchise holds its own and can be quite enjoyable for any horror fan to watch.

This film is very good. Even when I knew a seen a scene was going to feature a jump scare, it still scared me.

" A further step down
",0.0,0.8255,2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,"'Insidious: Chapter 3', the first of two prequels to the original film, isn't very good, as it becomes a further step down for this series.I like the place they go with this, with a look into what happened before the Lamberts appear. However, what is created to fill that void doesn't particularly deliver the goods. Compared to the other productions, this one has lesser acting, a not as interesting premise and barely any scares - though there is one important event early on with Quinn which did surprise me.Quinn is portrayed by Stefanie Scott, who is perfectly fine in the role - I like her. Dermot Mulroney is OK, while it's pleasant to see Lin Shaye (Elise) and Angus Sampson (Tucker) reprise their respective characters. Rose Byrne and, to a minor extent, Patrick Wilson are missed.Nothing dreadful, but these films are slowly dropping down the pecking order."

This is a solid, by the numbers, horror film. Unlike the Insidious 2, this has about half the number of characters so you can actually remember them. There's a plot, that's an improvement. It's not remotely scary or clever, but at least you can follow what's going on and you get some jump scares."

" GOT MORE HATE THAN DESERVED!
",-0.6468,-0.9169,2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"Most horror film sequels cannot live up to anywhere near the level of the first installment in the franchise, however Insidious Chapter 3 is not as good as Insidious, it isn't a bad sequel (well technically prequel) and gets a lot more hate than deserved.It immediately interested me knowing it was a prequel, not just because it was set before Insidious and Insidious Chapter 2 but because it focuses on a different family.Whereas the first film has no reason to suspect anything paranormal, the film begins with a teenage girl named Quinn turning up at Elise's (the psychic from the other Insidious films) house, asking if she could contact her deceased mother. When things start to go bad for Quinn, getting hit by a car and tormented by something strange she immediately suspects something paranormal.The film has some cliche jump scares and the really loud music compared to the dialogue is very opposite and can cause a cheap jump scare, but it also contains some creepy scenery (the waving man in the beginning for example) and some jump scares land.Not a great film, but a decent prequel to Insidious which for me ranks above Insidious Chapter 2"
" A horror prequel that works as a standalone film
",-0.5719,0.9327,2019-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Teenager Quinn Brenner has tried to contact her late mother on her own and then she goes to see medium Elise Rainier. Elise tells her she is retired but is persuaded to help; instead of contacting Quinn's mother she senses a malevolent presence. She advises Quinn to not attempt to contact her mother again. Shortly afterwards Quinn is involved in a serious accident which requires her to have both legs set in plaster while she recovers. When she return homes see starts seeing a shadowy man wearing an oxygen mask. After a number of increasingly frightening events her father goes to Elise to get help. Things don't go too well so Quinn's brother suggests contacting Specs and Tucker, a pair of internet ghostbusters.This film is set some time before the events of the previous films and doesn't really require any knowledge of those films. That said there are a few elements that are more fun if you have some knowledge of the characters. It adds good backstory and shows how Elise came to work with unlikely associates Specs and Tucker. The story provides plenty of scares; some are just the usual jump scares but there is also an impressively pervasive creepiness much of the time. As with the previous films it manages to eschew gore and any real nastiness. The cast is solid enough; most notably Lin Shaye who makes a welcome return as Elise. Overall I wouldn't say this was a must see but if you are a fan of the genre it is more than good enough."

My only complaint would be that it's a little bit slow. Another point I want to stress about in general is that people rate films 1/10 for very stupid reasons. For example some people rate the film 1/10 for not showing much of the lambert family, really??? Just because there was one small small detail you didn't like the film is automatically terrible?. People really need to consider what makes a film 1/10. A film rated like this would mean its absolutely horrifically awful not. Not just because there was a tiny detail you didn't like. Because of this. I find many films get ranked down for no reason. But anyways I absolutely adored this film and would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the genre/The Insidious franchise.

" Insidious Chapter 3 journeys further back into the ""Further"" with further jump scares and a commonplace plot.
",-0.34,-0.983,2019-08-21 00:00:00,5,"Long-time collaborator Whannell takes the helm in what is his directorial debut, a prequel to Wan's insanely popular franchise. The Lambert haunting is done and closed (for now, until Blumhouse desire more money...), which begs the question ""is a prequel truly necessary?"". The simple answer is no. Yet, to dismiss this chapter entirely would be unfair, as there is a slight layer of thematic depth that makes the obnoxiously loud jump scares tolerable. A teenager tries to contact her deceased mother, only to be followed by a malevolent force who wants her soul.The ""Man Who Can't Breathe"". He may not be as memorable or antagonising as Darth Maul or the 'Woman In Black' (the originality is extraordinary...), but he certainly irritates with that crackling oxygen mask and his feet constantly dipped in tar. To be fair to Whannell, attempting to continue Wan's creation by mimicking his directorial style is no easy task. The man is a modern horror icon. And there are moments, such as when the demon is casually waving to Quinn in the distance in complete silence (only to be Grand Theft Auto'd by the quietest car ever...), where the atmospheric aesthetic truly works. The piercingly loud jump scares that destroyed my subwoofer and my ears? Not so effective. They're predictable and hold no creepiness at all.What does work however, is the dynamics between the father and daughter. The relatable instance that they find themselves in proves to be a prickly relationship that needs mending. The ghostly apparitions acts as a catalyst for the father's realisation that he is losing his daughter. There's a level of emotional influx that enables the characters to resemble actual humans as opposed to typical horror tropes that plague the genre.The real icing on the cake though is Shaye's involvement. Don't get me wrong, she was decent in the previous instalments. However this prequel explores her retirement and melancholy, building her character to be, again, an actual human being. She isn't just this heroic demonologist that launches entities across a room whilst taunting the words ""come on, b*tch!"" (Totally badass though!). No. She is vulnerable, like you and I, an empathic glimpse that allows us to connect with her.Unfortunately, the final act when she ventures into the ""Further"" (which she quickly trademarks with no real exploration) sees Whannell cram as many nods to the Lambert haunting as possible and barely focuses on the current story. Carl sharing photos of a young Josh Lambert, as if that's the only successful case she's done. The ""Bride in Black"" haunting Elise all these years for no apparent reason. And, predictably, the ""Red-faced Demon"" peeps in to say hello right at the very end, concluding on a jump scare.It's a prequel of two halves. As a horror film, it's mainstream nonsense with absurdly loud jump scares and forced continuity for the sake of continuing on a franchise. But as a drama, there is depth. There is reason. There is something! The characters and the respective performances eclipse a weak screenplay that just about holds some thematic substance and atmosphere."

SPOILERS
really? She physically fights the ghosts? c'mon. nothing in the original two would lead you to put that in the third. it was definitely dumbed down for the audience, like the first time she fights the ghost and has a flashback of when her friend told her she's stronger than them cause she's alive. that happened like 20 minutes earlier, we don't need a flashback.late in the movie she asks dude if he can use the camera to record in the dark. He says yes, but never used the camera again.at the end, the main character talks to her dead mom. afterwards, she asks Elise "" she's not coming back is she?"" I was a little confused by that question but assumed she meant that her mom's ghost was leaving and not coming back to be around her. but Elise's response proved otherwise: ""not to this world, no."" really? So the girl was asking if her mom who has been dead for over a year is coming back to life? great writing (sarcasm)one example of this movie not following the premise of the previous ones is that they were able to wake her up from the further by just shaking her. She did not have to go back to her body which played a big role in the previous movies"

Psychic Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) is retired and living in a hoarder home when a perky teenage girl Stefanie Scott comes by with one last job. She wants someone to reach out to her dead mother. Lin Shaye does a half-hearted seance, and it turns out Lin has a stalker (The big bad from the first two films). Unable to help the Stefanie Scott she recommends some other psychics that could help and shuffles her out the door. Various shenanigans happen, and the Stefanie Scott's father (Dermot Mulroney) pleads with Elsie to come to the aid of his daughter. And we all know what that means - a seance.The Good: The best part of the Insidious: Chapter 3 is the performances. Two, in particular, stand out.Dermot Mulroney is outstanding in the otherwise thankless role as the concerned father and grieving widower. He brings a subtle gravitas to what could have easily been a thankless role. He had the opportunity to be this films Patrick Wilson, but honestly, the script doesn't give him enough to do.Stefanie Scott as the daughter seeking help is a real find. I haven't seen her in anything before that I can recall (According to IMDb I saw her in Small Town Crime. I honestly can't remember seeing Small Time Crime let alone Stefanie Scott.) She is so good in the role you fully expect the filmmakers to take advantage of this fact; as you will see below, that is not the case.Oh, one last thing, when Lin Shaye is in the netherworld/ haunted house, she has this really cool lantern with a bent metal frame. I looked to see if I could buy one but had no luck finding it. Insidious: Chapter 3 is leaving some money on the table with its lack of product tie ins.The Bad: Prequels to fictional works have the same issue that most movies based on well know history does. We often know who is going to die and definitely know who isn't. There is one scene during a later seance where more than half the characters in the scene had appeared in the first two films. As a result, we can tell that the demon isn't going to kill them or tear an arm off or something. Hard to have tension when we know how it ends up for the majority of the cast.Another problem with prequels is that filmmakers seem to be unable to resist the urge of telling the origin of everything that worked in the earlier films. ( See the Star Wars prequels or even Solo: A Star Wars Story for a treasure trove of examples). Want to know how Lin Shaye hooked up with her comic relief internet ghostbusters (no not really) don't worry the movie is going to tell you. The problem with this is this kind of fan service takes away from the actual story of Insidious: Chapter 3. We spend so much time with Lin Shay defeating the demon from the first two films triumphantly (Complete with distinct applaud pauses for the audience.) that we don't have any clear idea of what is going on with the new characters in this actual story.Which brings us to the biggest problem with Insidious: Chapter 3, why exactly was Stefanie Scott being haunted? Did we ever establish this in any way? For that matter why did she seek out Lin Shaye? Yes, she missed her mom and wanted to talk to her but that is such a thin premise, and she seems otherwise such a smart and well put together girl you keep waiting for some other motivation to drop. It never does.Not that Lin Shaye helps her anyway. Almost none of her encounters in the other realm have anything to do with the dead mother task at hand.Which brings me to another relatively large problem I had with Insidious: Chapter 3, this is a cheap looking film. I know these movies don't cost much to make what with character actors and newcomers performing the lead roles and special effects that are just people wearing make-up. The cost of this one has to be very low. But still, why is the production design so cheap. The sets for the Dark Place look like a high school haunted house. This criticism isn't some snarkiness. All we get is Lin Shaye and her cool lantern going down hallways constructed with plywood and a lick of paint while weirdly dressed extras do jump scares.The Ugly: I know I am picking on this film a lot here but you know for a psychic warrior Lin Shaye is pretty dim and easily fooled. She is contstantly walking backwards, not looking behind her, assuming friendly looking ghosts in Hell are friendly, forgetting that demons can take the form of loved ones. Good lord, I would expect this from some neophyte, but the entire point of her character is that she knows what she is doing.Also, that jump scare at the end of the film is the worst jump scare I have ever seen in any movie ever. I stand by this comment.In Conclusion: I thought I was going to miss Patrick Wilson, but I didn't. Dermot Mulroney and Stefanie Scott gave fantastic performances. What I missed was everything else. Insidious: Chapter 3 looks cheap and tells a muddled story full of fan service but little else. Instead of creating a new legend it concentrated in celebrating an old one and was weaker for it."

The teenage girl is in big danger since she was targeted by a very dangerous supernatural force.I liked this movie because it had a very simple but interesting plot and a nice direction. The way this movie was connected to the previous was very clear and without any other unnecessary information that may cause any plot hole. Regarding the direction which was made by Leigh Whannell who was also the director of the first movie, I found it very good, with many good and scary scenes. I enjoyed the interpretation of Lin Shaye who played as Elise Rainier and she was for one more time very good at it. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Stefanie Scott's who played as Quinn Brenner and Angus Sampson's who played as Tucker and gave a different touch in the movie with his unique way.Finally, I have to say that ""Insidious: Chapter 3"" is a nice horror movie to watch, it has a simple but decent plot and a good direction. If you have already watched and liked the previous two movies then I am sure that you are going to enjoy that too. But even if you haven't watched them I believe that you won't be disappointed by watching this movie at all."

The very concept of a horror film that focuses on a character that dies in the future is just an idea that can't work. We know the character can't die now, so there is no tension when you see a ridiculous looking ghost jump out and grab her.
Aside from that, the direction is mediocre, the acting is decent at best, the script is familiar and unoriginal, and the film overall is just not frightening. If James Wan hadn't left the directors chair it may have worked, but without him the whole series has been suffering, and I don't think it has any hope of recovery."

Yes, this movie had some in-depth character development and family drama. Does it make it a worse horror movie? I don't think so. The final scenes genuinely brought a tear to my eye. I didn't find it out of place. Don't forget that the insidious movies are all about the further, the light and dark that wait for us when we pass. It's only natural that they talk about the deceased at one point, and the effect they still have on us living people.
There's no rule book that says that horror movies can't contain some family drama, some romantic notions... Stop expecting them to be 100% tense and frightening all-the-time and you should be fine watching this."

" Leigh Wannell is better at directing than acting
",0.4404,0.9854,2018-12-22 00:00:00,7,"This was the best of the 3. I was actually interested in this one and I found myself wanting to keep watching it. Stefanie Scott is the main reason why. She is a very good actress. Her acting is so real and believable. In the hands of a lesser actress this could have gone a different way. I've seen her in other stuff and she has done well in everything so far.Dermot Mulroney brought nothing to his role or the movie. He had such promise when he was first starting out as a young actor a million years ago but since then he's just become gradually worse until he seems like he's stoned or on drugs or just completely over everything when he acts. I can't stand the vibe he brings to his roles and I wish he'd stop getting work. Whatever talent he had has long gone. I don't think anybody is checking for him any longer. I doubt anyone would miss him if he stopped acting.The Insidious franchise is pretty subpar but Lin Shaye sure owned her role. Even though these aren't great movies she went all in and I think elevated these movies to some degree. She is the face of horror films and she does a really good job with her part.Angus Sampson is beyond annoying. He is one of the main reasons this franchise wasn't great. He has no sense of timing or acting ability in general. He's awkward and irritating. The movies might have been slightly better with another actor in that role.This was the only one of the 3 that came close to slightly scaring me. This movie wasn't scary - it was more like a thriller but the one scene where the arm came down out of the ceiling and grabbed the lead kind of slightly unnerved me but other than that there wasn't much else that came close to being scary.The one thing that I wondered about is Elise's dog Warren. Did she ever let him out? She leaves the house-it's in it's bed next she comes back it's still in it's bed.This movie took a long time to get to the ""good stuff"" and there was a lot of extra parts that didn't seem necessary. It could have been pared down more.Leigh Wannell is a terrible actor but I was surprised that of all the movies in the franchise this one was the best in my opinion and since he was the director he has to get credit for that. Stick to directing Leigh!The end credits were fantastic. I loved them and wish the whole movie would've had that vibe. It's a shame that such nice work was at the end of the film. It was wasted.If you like a good suspense movie then give this a go but if you're expecting to be terrified this won't be the film for you."

You spend the whole movie like.. ok... when are they gonna do it and get over with it? Thankfully, the movie is not thaaat long and you can watch it within the blink of an eye, which is sad, as it i had higher expectations (same happened with Annabelle, now that i think about it...).This movie could be categorized as a horror movie from the pile, nothing special, something just to spend some time and then forget about it. if you loved the first two Insidious you will be disappointed, if not, please go watch them now!!

" Back to the beginning
",0.0,0.4413,2018-10-21 00:00:00,5,"It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.Although there are people who understandably dislike it, found myself enjoying the first 'Insidious'. It didn't blow me away but it was well made and genuinely scary. So watched 'Insidious: Chapter 2' hoping it would be as good. 'Insidious: Chapter 2' for me was watchable but not as good, and feel the same about the third instalment. There are big drawbacks but there are good things here too.First and foremost, 'Insidious: Chapter 3' looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The effects are also suitably eerie. Although a bit too loud in spots, the music is hauntingly atmospheric.Leigh Whannell does a surprisingly decent job for his first time in the director's chair and there are some genuine shocks and some creepy scares and dread. Did like the restraint of some of the first part once it gets going and it was here where 'Insidious: Chapter 3' was at its strongest. The acting is not bad at all, with Stefanie Scott a strong lead and the acting honours going to Lin Shaye's ghoulish gusto-filled Elise. There is emotional impact with the theme of coping with loss and there are characters worth caring for.Regrettably, 'Insidious: Chapter 3' has drawbacks. It does lack tension and suspense all the way through and other scares are predictable, more silly than creepy and felt like throwing in as many horror elements as one can muster regardless of originality. Some of the film is on the dull side, with it taking too long to get going, while the second half gets feels like a completely different film. After a restrained first half that was flawed but had a good deal of atmosphere still, the second half comes over as too silly and over-the-top, the suspense and dread diminishing and the lack of sense and stupidity increasing. There is very little new here or much to set it apart from what was seen before, being even more derivative than the first two entries which both lacked originality too. For a prequel parts and ideas were not developed enough, any explanations generally were neither plausible or interesting and there are more questions raised than answers, not good for something meant to clean and tie things up.Moreover, 'Insidious: Chapter 3' fails to make sense and gets muddled in the latter stages. The ending perplexes and the ghostbusters were annoying and served no real point. The script does not sound very natural and lacks tautness.Altogether, watchable but a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" Insidious for teenagers.
",0.0,-0.5483,2018-09-10 00:00:00,4,"I enjoyed the original Insidious. Part 2 not so much. But what I did like about both was that they didn't revolve around a teen protagonist, like so many horror movies.Insidious 3, on the other hand, does just that, presumably to appeal to the lucrative teen market, and it's all the worse for it, with a pretty but otherwise unremarkable lead in Stefanie Scott, and lots of mechanical scares (despite director Leigh Whannell's insistence to the contrary, claiming that he has stripped the franchise back to basics and concentrated on suspense and atmosphere).The predictable plot goes something like this: teenager Quinn Brenner (Scott) contacts psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) after her own failed attempts to contact her dead mother. When it becomes apparent that Quinn has attracted the attention of a malevolent demon, Elise is called in to help, along with ghost hunters Specs and Tucker (Whannell and Angus Sampson).Shadowy figures lurking in the background; unexplained noises; gnarly hands reaching from the darkness; and Elise head-butting the Bride in Black: it's all very predictable and occasionally laughably stupid."

I certainly jumped a good amount of times, as you are accustomed to in the Insidious movies. And I was frightened especially when the main actress had been knocked onto the floor, and that demon was walking around on the floor. Very gripping to say the least.It's one of the few prequels in horror that delivers a good amount of originality while still residing in the same world as the sequels.

I'm so not an Insidious fan. Yes, the film had some scary moments, but that darn sudden blaring music scared me half to death more than anything else! Most of those moments were creepy enough, they didn't need that overdone music. Man, that was annoying!! Dermot Mulroney's character as the father wasn't fleshed out enough. For most parts of the film he was just there when something happened, but then did nothing about it. He was a very passive character. And why did the 'paranormal investigators' have to be such idiots? This is so cliched and offers nothing new. Also, what was the purpose of them being there, as they virtually did nothing! When Elise (Lin Shaye) showed up, she took over the 'investigation' anyway. There really was no need for these other characters.

But that's not to say Chapter 3 is a bad movie. It's well filmed, has decent acting - especially the ever reliable Lin Shaye - and packs in plenty of jump scares in it's fairly modest running time, even if they tend to be of the predictable variety (with the exception early on involving the motor accident). In my opinion part 2 is the best out of the first 3."
" Are you ready for the ""BOO""?
",0.3612,0.9539,2018-01-10 00:00:00,4,"I suppose Leigh Whannell earned the right by now to further exploit and benefit from the commercially successful horror franchises that he co-created himself. After all, Whannell co-wrote the original ""Saw"" as well as the previous two ""Insidious"" installments, but James Wan took most of the credit for those being also the director. With Wan moving on towards mainstream stuff, like ""Fast and the Furious"", Whannell was entirely solo to take credit as writer, director and supportive actor for this third episode. Good for him because, let's be totally honest, in case this particular story was released as a stand-alone horror film - rather than as a sequel (or prequel, whatever) in the ""Insidious"" series - it wouldn't have stand a change at success. ""Insidious: Chapter 3"" is watchable, but completely mundane and unremarkable. It's a tale of ghosts and spiritual possession like there are thirteen in a dozen; relying mostly on a handful of foreseeable ""boo""-moments and a more elaborated role for actress Lin Shaye. A teenage girl, Quinn Brenner, seeks the help of retired spiritual medium Elise Rainier to get in contact with her deceased mother. Elise warns her that calling out to one specific dead soul can be overheard by all deceased souls, including the malignant ones. Later, near the apartment building where she lives, Quinn is lured into a vicious accident by an unidentified evil spirit and she breaks both her legs. While tied to her bed, the same spirit attempts to take possession of Quinn's body as it turns out to be the ghost of a former resident of the building who committed many vile acts when he was alive. There isn't a lot more to write about this film, honestly. I wasn't particularly bored when watching ""Insidious: Chapter 3"", but it's never at one point atmospheric or genuinely unsettling. The jumpy moments are too obvious and the make-up effects are tame and very PG-13. Part three is a prequel, taking place a year or 2-3 prior to the events in the original ""Insidious"", and already features brief appearances of ghost and demons that would play far more prominent roles in the other two films. Interesting trivia for the die-hard fans of the franchise, but I must admit they slipped my attention at first. While I'm writing this user-comment, another new installment - ""Insidious: The Lasts Key"" in the series is about to be released in theaters. Remember the ancient horror rule: sequels are truly becoming awful when they stop numbering them!"
" Far from the quality of the first two films.
",0.0,0.9896,2018-01-05 00:00:00,3,"The first film was excellent and the second was equally good, although it has some weaknesses. This movie, however, was disappointing... as the second film took any chance of making a continuation, they tried to make a prequel but, since there was no story for it, they had to create a new one. It revolves around a girl who tried to contact her own mother's spirit but ended up, somehow, catching the eye of an evil entity. This is where our old acquaintance Elise comes in, and we learn that she's also being pursued by a spirit. That is, the film tries to make a clear connection with the previous films, and even manages to do it... but the ending spoiled everything. It's clear from the very beginning that this film doesn't have the same quality as the others and the script uses a lot of predictable features and does not give us anything new but, despite that, the film would have been average if the ending was not so bad and so cliche.Lyn Shaye returns to give life to the main character but she doesn't have much to give us. She is a good actress and, in fact, it's she who carries the film, but it lacks a good story for her to shine; Stefanie Scott was well too, she did an average work. The remaining cast ends up in the shadow of these two actresses and, in contrary to the two previous films, Elise's helpers was unnecessary. Technically there is nothing to mention, besides some good scares, a pleasant feel of tense and an excellent use of sound and visual effects.To summarize and conclude, this movie is not totally bad, but it's far from my expectations."
" OK, But nothing special
",-0.2312,0.811,2018-01-04 00:00:00,4,"The main problem that lies in this film is the simple fact that it is a prequel that focuses on a character that was already killed off in the first film. The movie isn't poorly done necessarily, but I just can't feel any tension when I know nothing bad can happen to the main character. However, if i'm going to review this movie on it's own I must say that some of the ideas and themes explored are pretty good and show great potential , and some of the scares and creature designs are quite inventive.
If your invested in this series I suggest you watch it and, you might get something out of it, after all, as horror sequels go this one isn't the worst,but lets face it, that really isn't saying much."
" Insidious Chapter 3 is dark, intense, and good entertaining horror film with elements of suspense and mystery.
",0.34,0.8866,2017-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Insidious Chapter 3: Movie Review.Is Insidious Chapter 3 is as good as Insidious 1 and 2 ? For Me, both as a Horror Fan and Insidious series fan, Yes, it is, but it could have been much better. Overall, its, a good horror film. The film has surprising elements of emotions too. The movie has an excellent aspect of horror and has a creepy vibe and tone. The movie looks and feels visually haunting.Insidious Chapter 3 serves as a prequel to both Insidious 1 and Insidious Chapter 2 .The film is a prequel that takes place before the events of the previous two films.The direction and performances are okay. The movie is little slow and there are some unnecessary underdeveloped characters with some underwhelming story plots. The screenplay seems little dull at some points and few jump scares looks cheap and unrealistic.All over, Insidious Chapter 3 is a good horror film with right kind of suspense and emotion too and the movie is satisfying and entertaining. Insidious Chapter 3 is another good horrifying addition to Insidious Series.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Good Horror/Supernatural Flick!
",0.4926,0.2023,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"This 2015 horror film stars Lin Shaye, Stefanie Scott and Dermot Mulroney. This is a prequel to ""Insidious"" that takes place a few years prior where psychic, Elise Rainier (Shaye) helps young girl, Quinn (Scott) who is haunted by a demonic spirit. Mulroney (The Grey) plays Quinn's father, Sean and Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell also appear as Tucker and Specks, paranormal investigators who will eventually work with Elise. This is a good horror/supernatural flick and Shaye is great in it. Horror buffs should give this one a view."
" Less than average foray into the prequel of Insidious...
",0.0,0.984,2017-08-16 00:00:00,4,"As much as I enjoy horror movies and supernatural horror movies, then I never really found much enjoyment in the ""Insidious"" franchise, being less than impressed with the first two movies in the series. But still, I got around to watch the third movie, which apparently is a prequel.Right, well the storyline was pretty straight forward. Easy to follow and it just basically trotted ahead on a predetermined path. The story was just oozing with predictability at every corner, so there was no surprises to be had here.I hardly think that the story told in ""Insidious: Chapter 3"" was particularly innovating or original. Actually, if you are a long time fan and follower of the horror genre, then chances are very likely that you have already seen numerous movies with a storyline similar to the one told in ""Insidious: Chapter 3"".The strongest side to the movie is the cast and the performances that they put on. It is definitely Lin Shaye who carries this movie with a rather solid performance of her established Elise character. Personally, then I also enjoy watching Angus Sampson in the role as Tucker, despite him only having a small role in the movie.The entities that were present in this movie were adequate, not overly impressive in design, but they definitely were vicious. Personally, I would have liked to have had a bit more grotesque and scary appearance on the entities, just for shock effect, as there was little to be scared about with a frail man walking around with a breath mask.""Insidious: Chapter 3"" is not the most outstanding or entertaining of the movies in the franchise so far. Sure, it is entertaining and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, just don't set your expectations too high."
" A prequel to the Insideous series. A truly chilling horror movie.
",-0.2263,0.5994,2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Chapter 3 takes us back before the first two installments of the Insidious Franchise. This movie is a truly chilling horror movie, going more for the hair-raising creepiness of demons caught between the living and the after life rather than relying on cheap startling pops to make it scary. Stefanie Scott succeeds in gaining the audience's sympathy as her character, Quinn Brenner, a teenage girl who recently lost her mother, suffers a debilitating accident, and has to battle with the paranormal realm. Lin Shaye reprises her role as the medium Elise Reiner. We see Elise's life before the Lambert family hauntings, and we even get to see how Elise meets Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) Quinn lives with her father Sean Brenner (Dermot Mulroney) and younger brother Alex (Tate Berrey). Quinn begins to witness strange happenings in her room at night, and she seeks out the help of Elise. Quinn tells Elise that she believe her mother is trying to communicate with her, and therefore she has tried to contact her mother. Elise explains that when trying to contact an individual, all can hear; and that Quinn has opened the gates to some not-so-friendly, or shall I say insidious, demons. Reluctant at first, Elise agrees to help Quinn, but not before the Brenners seek the help of paranormal bloggers Specs and Tucker. The film is suspenseful throughout. The movie ends with a teaser for a fourth chapter. As long as they keep them as good as the first three, I look forward to seeing more."
" Almost As Good As The First, And Better Than The Second
",0.6728,-0.9868,2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Writer/Director/actor Leigh Whannell creates a surprisingly good horror movie with ""Insidious: Chapter 3."" Most horror series, once they are up to part 3, the truly horrifying thing about them is how badly they are made and how much they suck. Not so with this third round of the ""Insidious"" movies, which makes it more of an abnormality¬Öin a good way.Stefanie Scott plays a teen who recently lost her mom to cancer, and now she is hearing things and believe it's her mom trying to contact her. But instead of letting the dead be dead, Scott tries to communicate with the entity she thinks is her mom ‚Äî but it's not her mom. A terrible accident has Scott die for a few seconds, and when she comes to life, she will find that she has brought something very evil into her life¬Öa spirit that she nor her family can fight off by themselves.Coming to their rescue ‚Äî maybe ‚Äî is an elderly medium we have seen from the first two ""Insidious"" movies, played by Lin Shaye. Although Shaye had many encounters with dark spirits in the past, giving her an insight and wisdom on what to do, Shaye is spiritually weakened by a personal tragedy and a direct threat to her life from The Bride In Black spirit. To be successful in helping Scott and keeping herself alive, Shaye must deal with her fears, or else two good souls will be lost forever.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is the scene when Scott, possessed by a demon, breaks off her cast on both legs and starts walking. As Scott walks, the bones in her legs can be heard breaking again! This poor girl¬Öeven if she frees herself from the demon, she's going to have one hell of a recovery period from those broken bones!Fans of ""Insidious"" will be very satisfied with this third chapter ‚Äî it's almost as good as the first, and better than the second. It has a few cheap scares, but most of the scares are set up well and play up to your fears of things that lurk in the shadows.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Avoid at all costs! DO NOT SEE IT!
",-0.4184,-0.9849,2017-06-26 00:00:00,2,"Don't say I haven't warned you, if you even bother to read this.I was looking for a movie to watch with my girlfriend who hardly has seen any horror flicks. I'm 34 years old, she's 23. After much doubt I went with this one. Remembering the first one was rather good, I thought to myself it can't be that bad. Within the first 15 min it becomes very predictable showing the entity, what bothered me is that my girlfriend was on the edge of her seat, I can relate to the fact she hardly has seen any. So I decided to hang on a bit and see if it would become by any means a bit interesting.The movie uses extremely clich√© jump scares, with double volume. Which is the only reason you jump your seat because of the loudness. Not at all from the scenes. There is NO charisma from any character, nor is there any emotion that draws you to the characters itself.I won't go to much in detail about this, since I already wasted an hour of my life trying to like it a bit.. and even wasting more time writing this. I felt that I had to write this review because there are way too much reviews that are kind to this film, even saying that it's the best one yet.. I can understand if you only watched disneymovies in your life, this is a scary movie.. Sadly Gremlins which is a good movie, compared to this would be the mother of all horror-films.If any reviewer who voted more than 4 stars read this, please let me know how much money you made writing it. I suppose it's a decent amount as any more than 4 stars for this movie is an absolute lie and a disgrace to us horror fans. I think it's sad there is no other option on IMDb to call out liars. I cannot fathom at all there is a 4th installment of this utter boring predictable flick. I cannot relate to anyone saying it's close to being an OK film which it is not.I never felt so angry that I had to write a review exposing the lies they feed us on IMDb. Every next scene the entity is there to jump-scare you, I predicted scene after scene. Which made me start making dinner in the middle of movie, simply out of boredom."
" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.7859,2017-04-15 00:00:00,3,"Another PG13 horror movie. That rating is like shouting ""Don't worry, we aren't going to scare you!!!! Bring your family, bring the kids, we are as bland as tofu."" And it is.Like all the others they are going for one or two fast jumps and...that's it.Pointless without the Horror/Comedy label, but Hollywood is afraid to attach humor to anything frightening under the belief the Millennials won't ""get it."" So you have, well, you have a film that is going out of its way to not be scary to keep the rating family friendly...And for some reason I watched it."
