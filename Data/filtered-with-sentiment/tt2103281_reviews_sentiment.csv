" A Great Sequel
",0.6249,0.995,2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,"A really great follow up that builds on what the first film set up, and still features fantastic effects, performances and action, even if they still haven't fixed some of the problems with the original. The big issue across these two films is that the human characters are very one-note and bland. Gary Oldman is the only complex human character in it - the rest just have one personality trait that is well explored, if that, and a lot of them make very stupid decisions. But on the flip side, Caesar is a fantastic character, and I really like how the apes' opinions on humans are affected directly by their experiences of them - it makes their characters a lot better. Andy Serkis is still fantastic, and the effects have aged very, very well. The action is really well shot, and has a really nice gritty feel, particularly in the second half. I will say that the first half was a tad slow for me, but I did appreciate how the film spent time building up the characters in order to go all out for the finale. The cinematography is strong and the story is well developed - those opening few minutes really pack a punch now. Overall, I wouldn't call this one of the best sequels of all time, but it is a genuinely great and recommendable film."
" What an amazing an tense movie
",0.34,0.891,2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,This is easily the best movie of 2014. It keeps you on the edge of you seat. Andy Serkis performance as/in Cesar is simly outstanding and oscar worty.
" A superior sequel in almost every sense
",0.5423,0.9984,2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes, like... REALLY liked it; this is no secret to those who know me or have read my review of the film here on iMDb, but Dawn is a film that holds a special place in my heart, not only because the film is spectacularly made (although that certainly does help) but also because of the circumstances in which I first experienced it which I will get to in a bit. First off, I'll start with what you will first notice about this film, the effects; the CGI in this movie is absolutely incredible, in the first scene alone we see these beautifully rendered apes, lining the trees in preparation for a hunt and the lighting is spectacular as well as the texture work on their skin, fur and depth and wetness of the eyes. They feel real, even now, and for a 7 year old movie? That's pretty impressive. I forgot to mention how this scene also happens to take place in the rain which adds another element of challenge but they pull it off superbly. I mean, you can see each individual raindrop effect each individual ape's fur! Next up on the block is the narrative, now, although admittedly nothing too special, I think considering the approach this film took with it's story, it's done as well as it can be done; I think the lack of truly original story is what drags this down from a 10 for me but I can't hold it back too much as there is only so much you can do with a post ape uprising earth, and what they do do (ha) is done to a tee. The acting is pretty top notch, I think almost every actor does a pretty solid job but the real standouts here are Andy Serkis as Caesar and Toby Kebell as Koba... wow. Possibly the best motion capture performances I've ever seen. Koba is a deeply damaged character who when we start the film, see has calmed down quite a bit now that he is living free with his own kind, away from the humans, but as the film goes on and he is reintroduced to the human threat, he breaks under the pressure and his scars reopen, it's really great stuff. Caesar continues on his natural trajectory from Rise and is now the leader of the California based ape civilisation we saw birthed in that prior movie. We see him struggle with leadership, parenthood and all things in between, it allows us to sympathise with him on another level and feel the weight of his actions as well as the consequences that surround him and having seen him grow from a baby in Rise, our emotional connection with him is already a strong one. Next, we have music. Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the feeling of Planet of the Apes as a whole while also bringing it's own flair, making it feel perfect for THIS movie and the scenes that it is used in.
In summary, this is a really, really good film and you should watch it, but I promised I'd tell you my first experience with it and why it means so much to me; when I was 15 me, my dad and my stepmother were all supposed to go and see the film in the IMAX together, unfortunately my dad got ill and it was cancelled. A few days later, my step-mum was supposed to be taking me to the train station, to stay with my birth mother, but unbeknownst to me, she took me to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it wasn't in IMAX but I didn't care, I got to spend some extra quality time with my step-mum and watch a bada** film before I left and it's a memory that perseveres through the many that have faded.
I'm going to give Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a 9/10. Thank you for reading this LONG review and have a lovely day or night, wherever you may be."
" A Worthy Sequel!
",0.4926,0.9961,2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Im not professional, but i don't get the bad reviews. People blinded by bad expectations.Okay so first of all, what's the complains? Story, story, story and story... «Too predictable.» For me this movie was average predictable, and because if that should not be the main complain. Take John Wick, a super cheesy movie with the most cheap story ever, and guess what? It has the same rating as this masterpiece! John Wick is incredibly predictable and not one single review is complaining about it, but rather praises the action scenes. Hello? Wake up «professionals»!Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is brilliant, the plot is extremely enganging, the villian is one of the best characters ever. He's backstory makes completely sense and allows you sympathize for him. Not only that, but it switches over from apes to humans and back and forth all the way.In my opinion it's the perfect sequel, to ROTPOTA (Rise of the planet of the apes)
The visual effects are revolutionary, the characters are interesting and makes you wanting more, the plot is incredibly engaging, the Andy Serkis is a genius.So over all, the idea is good, and the execution is brilliant! Thank you Matt Reeves for not ruining Rise!"
" One of the best Planet of the Apes movie
",0.6369,0.8992,2021-01-10 00:00:00,9,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is at the same time a great Planet of the Apes movie and a terrific science fiction movie. The way speech is brought upon in the movie is amazing and really brings a lot of reality to something so out of the box. The tension is palpable through the whole movie and there's never a dull moment.

" In the ironic tragedy of evolution, the nature intrinsic to the two species - homo sapiens and simius sapiens - is, after all, the same
",-0.7096,0.7485,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"In Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, ten years after the conquest of freedom, Ceasar (Andy Serkis) and the other monkeys live in peace in the forest near San Francisco. There they developed a community of their own, based on mutual support, while humans face one of the greatest epidemics of all time, the simian flu (which, however, was developed by humans in the laboratory) and which wiped out much of the world's population. Without electricity, a group of survivors plans to invade the forest and reactivate the plant installed there. Malcolm (Jason Clarke), the only one who knows the apes well, tries to act peacefully and prevent the confrontation from happening.A prologue to the script is portrayed in defense of family and property, showing a human society more devastated than ever, while the social organization of apes has also reached unprecedented complexity. They act in society, hunting, learning from their elders, taking care of each other. In charge of all this is Cesar, more mature, with some white hair and wrinkles from the experience he lived with his peers since we saw him disappear in the forests neighboring San Francisco. There is no (at least in principle) a dominant group. What is there are humans that also behave like animals and primates that sometimes act according to the most developed rules of coexistence of men. It is not even possible to be sure who started the confrontation that the title announces. Was it, then, the triumph of the individual, independent of the species? It is also not that simple.Although the plot revolves around the tension between the two races, the narrative does not leave out internal political issues for each group, in addition to the individual motivations of the characters. These elements deepen the plot, guarantee different layers throughout and reflect the complexity of our own society. The franchise known for working on political and social issues returns to touching on these issues without boring viewers, unlike The Inception, which oversimplified these aspects. With quotes ranging from the soundtrack of ""2001 - A Space Odissey"" to the battles of epics from the 60s, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is cinema committed to the viewer: to amuse him and make him think. It is darker than ""The Origin"". No less efficient. It has action and provocation in the measure. On both sides there are pacifists, who try to live harmoniously with the different. However, like real life, the thoughts of those who crave power prevail. Those who prefer to extinguish the opponent than try to live in peace. By bringing these themes to the fore, the film joins the list of blockbusters that go beyond pure spectacle.Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, wrote an excellent script that illustrates the behavioral similarities between apes and humans in a masterful way. Especially when there is so much hate and prejudice involved, something that in the film is common to both species. On the human side, Carver (responsible for the shooting, played by Kirk Acevedo) feels angry and blames the monkeys for spreading the disease that killed countless people. This feeling is common to most humans. On the other hand, Koba, overcome by a huge desire for revenge, believes that apes can and should get the better of humans while they still have the advantage. And right in the middle of them are Malcolm and Caesar, who believe that there is a way to live together peacefully.It is on a fine line that Caesar will need to balance his leadership, his family ties and his desires, desires and aspirations in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. His leadership is more than consolidated among the monkeys and his noble posture impresses Malcom, his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his partner Ellie (Keri Russell). Caesar's pacifism needs to consider all possible angles of all actions and a confrontation between the races is not in his interest, but the hatred between humans and monkeys does not allow enough time for mutual explanations and arrangements - even more so when an ape himself does question of launching into the air a universe built on fragile and suspicious relationships.The complex, malicious and treacherous Koba is the film's great antagonist - and Tobby Kebbell's performance capture is superb. The scarred bonobo - on his face and body - suffered for years in laboratories and does not trust any human being. Ironically, he is in charge of building an intrigue of Shakesperian contours, emulating the most sordid human characteristics and not thinking twice before crossing a line of coexistence defined as a fundamental rule by the apes themselves: monkey does not kill monkey. Koba tries to assassinate Caesar, corrupts Blue Eyes, and sets his own village on fire to provoke an inevitable war between monkeys and humans.If James Franco - who starred in the previous one - did not return, the cast corresponds to the smart script to match. From Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, as the conscious couple who try to resolve situations in a peaceful way, Gary Oldman, always competent, in the shoes of the leader who wants to override what he believes to be the inferior species, and Andy Serkis. Once again the actor lends his features to a character created from the performance capture - it was like that in ""The Lord of the Rings"", with Gollum, and in ""King Kong"" by Peter Jackson. His talent is helped by an increasingly efficient technology: sometimes we are more moved and involved with the monkeys, their looks, their features. It is possible to capture in your eyes and in both actions all the emotions that we are used to seeing in a human being, from joy and sadness to hatred and hopelessness.Several issues are addressed, but the one that stands out most is the difficulty in accepting and understanding others with all their differences, especially when there are deeper problems. It is much easier to simply point out the defects, errors, than to put oneself in place and try to understand. Sometimes reason needs to speak louder than emotion, or impulsive acts end up happening and causing unnecessary friction. Do you realize that prejudice is there? That senseless hatred makes humans act without thinking and thus jeopardize their own existence and that of the entire planet? The writers and director Matt Reeves delve deeper into the subject, without ever forgetting that it is a blockbuster designed to earn a lot in the summer of the northern hemisphere, a great film made to be released in the middle of the year and please the maximum of people possible. And they manage to tell an original, captivating and tension-filled story, filled with exquisite computer graphics.In visual effects, we have the return of Weta Digital, going beyond the work that was already spectacular in the first film, creating other digital animals besides monkeys and taking performance capture to a new level. The work of the Planet of the Apes technical team - The Showdown is so impressive that for most of the film you will wonder if those monkeys are actually created by computers, size is the degree of realism achieved - in a larger number of external shots and in adverse climatic conditions. Apes walk towards the construction of a humanized lifestyle and this is noticeable in the most evolved vocalization, in the expressiveness of their faces, capable of expressing a myriad of emotions and feelings without the need for dialogue, and in the physicality of body movements, which express the animalistic stance of the creatures at the same time that they begin to indicate the first signs of a simian humanization - visible also in the grandeur with which the horses ride.Technically impeccable, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes establishes a gloomy and darker environment than its predecessor. Photography and art direction make up a San Francisco in ruins that impresses, with the world being completely taken over by nature, vegetation that flourishes on all sides. Matt Reeves demonstrates an excellent sense of composition in the action scenes, building a complex clash at night involving monkeys mounted on horses, multiple weapons and even a battle tank, which does not disengage in the confusion of the various coordinated fronts because of the correct positioning camera and the subtle beauty of fire and explosions that sparkle across the blackness of the scene. The director also allows himself to start from the sensitivity of the great initial sequence, which in silent plans reveals the apes' lifestyle and the contours of that nascent civilization, to the malignity of the scene in which Koba pretends to be an ordinary monkey to steal the weapon of two human beings and murder them with extreme cold moments later.From the memory of his creator and friend Will, James Franco's character in Rise of the Planet of the Apes - relived in the respect that is born in his relationship with Malcom and in the return to the rubble of his first home in a moment of sadness and pain -, Caesar realizes that goodness can germinate in humans in the same way as in apes - as well as evil. How much humanity did the evolved monkeys inherit? He had never noticed how human the apes were. To think that monkeys were better than humans was his mistake - and a mistake that took too high a price. In the end, Caesar realizes that there are no absolute and immutable truths about the two races. With a pessimistic ending, which leaves the way open for its conclusion in War for the Planet of the Apes, we also foresee in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that the fate of the apes seems to be to erect a civilization as vicious as the human. In the ironic tragedy of evolution, the nature intrinsic to the two species - homo sapiens and simius sapiens - is, after all, the same."
" Didn't match the awesomeness of first one
",0.0,0.6369,2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,"I am big fan of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, movie was not upto the mark. The acting was okay except Ceaser's (whose acting was great). The plot was good but little bit stretched. The pacing was also problem but not a big one.Overall, you will enjoy the movie but it has some limitations."
" Expanding and deepening a series perfectly
",0.6369,0.9588,2020-09-08 00:00:00,10,"Matt Reeves took the foundation laid in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and he just flat out ran with it, making one of the best looking, most emotionally involving and satisfying, and all around best built film of the franchise. Everything about this film's story deepens and broadens the world and the characters, the visuals back it up intelligently, and the performances even from the secondary rank of characters are all top-notch. This movie is great.In the very first two Planet of the Apes movies there was an overt pessimism and borderline nihilism when it came to humanity and how its current state was going to destroy the future. The franchise largely and intentionally forgot about that, and that always kind of bugged me. And yet, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes actually flies in the face of that thematic base, not presenting humanity as unworthy of its place on top of the world order, but instead it changes the dynamic into a question about the nature of evil and how it can pop up anywhere. Humanity isn't preternaturally evil, and neither are the apes, but it's the presence of evil in both of them that causes the conflict that breaks out.About ten years after the events of the previous film, humanity is a shell of its former self, and Caesar, the talking ape, has moved his tribe into the forests to the north of San Francisco where they are building the beginnings of a new society. They hunt, they sign their thoughts to each other, and they teach their young to read and write in the English language. Their idyllic life gets challenged when, for the first time in two years, humans encroach on their territory. In several ways, the clash of civilizations story that plays out in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes reminds me of Terrence Malick's The New World. Set in a more natural state with an Eden-like idealized society free from outside influence, it's the mere touch and knowledge of the further world that ends up toppling the current order. Things build until neither society can accept the new order fully, and the clash erupts.Well, the humans are moving northward because they are running out of fuel in their sanctuary in the heart of San Francisco. They need to find the hydroelectric dam that fed the northern parts of the state of California, get it back up and running, and redirect the power south. Caesar is smart enough to realize that if he cuts off the humans completely, they're desperate enough to simply come back in force and take what they need, so in order to save the lives of his apes, he allows the work with tight oversight. This does not sit well with Koba, a bonobo who was most cruelly treated by humanity in his previous life as a test subject in scientific labs. The peace that manages to work out between the small group of humans, led by Jason Clarke's Malcolm, and the ape society moves in fits and starts and feels like it could be the cornerstone of something new and good. However, prejudice on both sides keeps it from fully forming. Carver, another human, blames the apes for the disease that wiped out humanity, and his actions of mistrust end up taking the most innocent moments and defiling them.Everything goes wrong, though, when Koba, feeling untrusted by Caesar who seems to love humans more than apes, goes to San Francisco and finds the human's Plan B in the form of weapons testing. There was left a large cache of weapons behind by FEMA, and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman in a small but surprisingly touching role) is having them tested to ensure their usability if Malcolm's mission fails and they need to move in in force. Koba, in a fantastic scene, uses his past as an ape among humans to disarm the two guys testing the weapons and kill them, takes the weapon back, shoots Caesar at the height of the peace between human and ape, and leaves the gun as evidence that humans did the deed.Structurally, it's interesting that the movie is essentially action free until about an hour and a half into the film. There are moments of tension (great tension, by the way) and a very early hunting scene, but outside of that, it's just straight drama. That dramatic work ends up benefiting the movie greatly for when the action does break out and it embraces some visuals that could have felt really schlocky but end up feeling genuine and terrifying. Koba leads the apes in a charge to the tower where the humans have set up their sanctuary, and the apes use horses and the weapons cache to fire upon the tower. I mean, it's images of apes riding horses firing machine guns (sometimes two at a time) in front of walls of fire. You put that at the beginning of a movie or in a story that doesn't have the dramatic support, and it's a cool image but that's it. Because Koba has been so well built and the situation between ape and human so well established, it's an emotional moment of terror as the conflict we knew was possible and never wanted breaks out in full force, demonstrating visually the hatred that had been brewing in Koba the whole film.The resolution of the film is really emotionally satisfying as well. Caesar, spending some days to recover at the hands of Malcolm and his doctor girlfriend Ellie, revisits the home that he and Will shared in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, helping remind him of the gentleness of humanity in the face of the betrayal of his own kind. Recovered enough, Caesar takes some loyal apes into the compound for a faceoff with Koba, and, at the same time, Malcolm has to faceoff against Dreyfus in a similar conflict. The two play really well off of each other because Caesar's becomes a fight on the tallest parts of the tower with Koba, full of dynamic action, while Malcolm's faceoff with Dreyfus is a lowkey affair where Malcolm simply tries to keep Dreyfus from pressing a button. Cutting from one to the other feeds the overall tension, but we don't get overwhelmed by the action playing out. It's an exceptionally well-built final action sequence that way.This is the only movie in the franchise other than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes that really trusts the apes to carry the film. That's not to say that the human characters aren't present, they are, but they rather explicitly act as support to Caesar's story. At the same time, the human side of things are surprisingly touching. It's not that they have their own movies going on at the same time, but Reeves and his writers created enough depth to each of the humans so that they felt real, driven by their own wants and needs, and not just because the plot demanded their subservience. It really is Caesar and Koba, though, who are the stars, representing a conflicting vision of the future that they ultimately cannot bridge. The supporting apes from Maurice, the orangutan, and Blue Eyes, Caesar's eldest son, are as emotionally complex and satisfying as the human supporting characters.The movie looks fantastic with fantastic visual effects from WETA Digital making the apes convincing pretty much every moment they're on screen. The music is really good, even going so far as to evoke the atonal score that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for the original Planet of the Apes. Performances are great throughout, and it's all so very well written. This is an outright great film and proof that Matt Reeves is one of the best big-budget directors working."
" The best of the trilogy
",0.6369,0.8226,2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"In the 10 years since Caesar (Andy Serkis) escaped captivity with the other apes and they left to live in the Redwood forests outside of San Francisco, a virus wiped out most of humanity. When a small group of humans stumble on the ape compound while in search of a dam for water and other survivors a great deal of mistrust exists between the humans and the apes with the potential of both tipping towards violence.Whereas RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011) merely served as a prelude to this better film, it is in effect a superb re-imagining of BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (1973) with good guys and bad guys on both sides clearly delineated. Serkis most assuredly has more to do in this film and the action and production design are superbly handled. Followed by WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017)."

The clever and deeply impactful story surrounding the race of sentient apes was surprisingly very human and the catalyst for a profoundly emotional storyline that is so intricately detailed in depicting the apes complexity in all its blazing glory that it goes well beyond the parameters of a simple blockbuster and into the territory of a more sophisticated grand epic!One could argue the human characters were not fleshed out and my response would be the new civilization of apes act like a mirror and reflect the very best and worst of mankind.. the whole film is a commentary on mankind for that matter!But I think there is one area we can all agree Gary Oldman's talents were totally wasted!Naughty Approved!"

To my surprise, it was even better.Having recently seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes for the first time, I have gotten a new level of appreciation for the reboot trilogy, this film in particular, which is my favorite of the three.To see the beginnings of the ape civilization is fascinating, but it wouldn't be nearly as interesting if it weren't for Andy Serkis' incredible performance as Caesar. Him and the Visual Effects artists had already brought this incredible character to life in the previous movie, but here, they cemented him as one of the decade's most memorable heroes.Also, the effects. Just, wow."

" Aped Humanism
",0.0,0.8434,2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an improvement upon the first entry in the rebooted franchise, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011), although the distinctions are about as slight as the difference between their titles, of ""rise"" and ""dawn."" The CGI is better, the lighting and tone darker, and there's a more compelling balance of the shared humanism of ape and man. Although, granted, members of both species are simply either good or bad, and females get the short shrift--one a mother sick with baby, the other a doctor who lost her child and so helps mother become well with baby. Meanwhile, the males play politics and war, within and between species. There's a focus on the parallel between Cesar and his first born and a counterpart human father and son, which further recalls Cesar's upbringing by James Franco, scientist.The cinematography, although another improvement here, still seems rather rudimentary for a picture featuring largely CGI creatures that can climb and swing through environments. It's too bad the camera doesn't do the same, although there's a so-so tracking shot of the human male hero for one wartime scene. The climactic fight sequence is a let down. As for the opening, retracing the spread of the virus that wipes out most of humanity, it's an admittedly hackneyed sequence that cuts together clips from CNN of real-world disasters, images of well-known politicians like President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg, with fictional reports, but such is the reason I watched this movie now. With the current coronavirus pandemic, such a media montage (science-gone-wrong, super simians aside) doesn't seem so far fetched."
" Eat your heart out, Star Wars
",-0.5574,0.9815,2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Finally! A prequel done right! Rise of the Planet of the Apes was great, but this is better than it in every way! The great thing about this movie is that it's not very clear who's good and who's bad. Both sides have good people and apes and bad people and apes. The documentary feel of this movie also helps instill emotions that would have otherwise not have been had this been filmed in a traditional way. See this is 3D if you can because the depth and detail make you feel you are right there with the humans fighting the war against the apes, and once you see the apes' side you feel as of you are right there quietly observing. When a human looks down the sight of his rifle, you feel you are that human about to shoot the ape. The great thing is that even if you haven't seen the previous installment ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" you can still understand this perfectly. The first 20 minutes are apes doing sign language with subtitles on the bottom of the screen but you can still understand even without them. This film conveys human emotion really well, and the score is breathtaking. If the Academy doesn't nominate this for best score I will never forgive them. Listen to it on a surround sound system, and just let it sweep over you.
Grade: A 10/10 5/5 stars"
" All Hail Ceasar
",0.0772,0.9893,2020-02-28 00:00:00,7,"I know that all the ""Planet of The Apes"" films might seem related or sequels of, but they are not. This is actually the first sequel to Rise of The Planet of The Apes, which was not related to the other ""apes"" movies, and has not much to do with either the first series 1968-1973, the 1974 TV series, and the re-make film in 2001. confused ?, so was I, but I am trying to fathom it.On its own it is actually a very good film, and better than ""Rise"", it is very thoughtful and has a great story line, A virus has killed most of the human population (timely review this with Covid-19 on the spread at the time of writing) with the few remaining living in the ruined city and the advanced apes living in the forest, of course they come into conflict, but some try to keep the peace whilst others are trying to kill. Its a usual story in mankind except this time one of the sides are apes.It is acted well and directed well, the scenes are well done, photography is excellent, the sets, particularly of the ruined city are great. The CGI is not too brilliant though, a bit better than in ""Rise"" but still not flawless, the apes and other creatures look great, its just when they move, it does not look natural, I know it isn't natural, but they are supposed to make it look natural, but it is getting better. The music was average.I have watched all the original films and these modern ones and there's one thing that bothers me though, and it is quite obvious if you think about it. We humans evolved from apes, and we look like we do now after millions of years evolvement, So why are the apes (apart from those medically enhanced) so advanced after only a few years, and in the old series, after being evolved for 2 thousand years, why don't they look more like us, more upright and less hair?
They should have consulted an Anthropologist before creating the costumes/CGI.But its a film, not a documentary, and it is sci-fi/fantasy, so I can't grumble too much, besides it is good, and if it had better music and CGI I would have rated it higher, possibly a 9."

",0.4404,0.9598,2020-02-23 00:00:00,7,"I struggled with Planet of the Apes reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, finding the plot dreary, human lead James Franco rather bland, and the CGI ape effects less than convincing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is far better in terms of storyline, progressing the narrative nicely into post-apocalyptic territory, and the digital trickery to bring the apes to life has improved. That said, I'm still not 100% sold on computer generated animals: it's clever stuff, to be sure, but even the best CGI isn't good enough to convince me that they're anything but pixels.Take the opening scene, for example: an army of apes hunts a herd of stags through the woods, only to be confronted by a bear. All of the animals are CGI, with the fancy camerawork swooping in and out of what is a presumably CGI enhanced environment. It's an overload of not quite completely credible visual wizardry that immediately reinforces the fact that most of what we are seeing has been realised with a fancy 3D software package. Since so much of the rest of the film relies on this technology, the whole experience, no matter how skilfully told, doesn't quite sit right. It's a shame because the acting and direction are very good, and the writing enjoyable (not always plausible, but still fun) with plenty of pathos and loads of action, as the human survivors of a 'simian flu' epidemic come to blows with a civilisation of intelligent apes lead by chimpanzee Caesar (performed via motion capture technology by Andy Serkis).If you're a fan of all things ape, then the positives outweigh the negatives, ensuring that the film is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. If anything, it does provide the awesome sight of a snarling chimpanzee riding a horse while firing two machine guns.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

He's had pretty great success at making Apes films, as he was behind both this film and 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes. He also wrote the fun popcorn flick Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. Oh yeah - and he also created the TV show Felicity.Ten years later, a group of people in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of the Simian Flu epidemic that's wiping out humanity, all while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his tribe of apes located in the Muir Woods.The humans are led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke, the remake of Pet Sematary) and they accidentally encroach into ape territory in search of a hydroelectric dam. Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash encounter the humans and Carver injures the latter. Koba, a bonobo scarred by human tests, urges Caesar (again, Andy Serkis) to go to war with the humans. However, Malcolm, his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee, who was in The Road and played Nightcrawler in the later X-Men movies) become friends with the apes, even treating Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.Judy Greer, who played that role, has a husband who is a huge Planet of the Apes fan. They had a chimp husband-and-wife cake topper at their wedding, while Planet of the Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes played at the bar.Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), another human leader, takes up arms, Koba goes into action. He sets the ape settlement on fire, nearly kills Caesar and blames the humans. When Ash refuses to betray Caesar's teachings, Koba throws him to his death and locks up anyone loyal to their fallen leader.War between ape and human is inevitable, even if Malcolm and his family save Caesar and nurse him back to health. Koba must fall, the first human army must be defeated and then the tribes of apes will be ready for the War for the Planet of the Apes.Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver returned to write this film, joined by Marc Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard, Insurgent, The Wolverine).I dig that the orangutan is named Maurice, which is a reference to Maurice Evans, who portrayed Dr. Zaius in the original films.The ending is pretty great, too. Koba is left hanging from a ledge after being knocked down by Caesar. He tries to say that ""Ape shall not kill ape,"" but Koba has already broken that rule many, many times by killing Ash and other apes. Caesar declares that Koba is not an ape and kills him."
" Beautifully executed are the filmography, CGI, and sound
",0.5719,0.9671,2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"+ JMJ An impressive multi-faceted film. Beautifully executed are the filmography, CGI, and sound. Instead of hindering the performances of the ""apes,"" the CGI effects help Andy Serkis (Caesar), Nick Thurston (Blue Eyes) and Toby Kebell (Koba)- along with their animators- attract brilliant performances. The cast of human characters almost equal their ape counterparts, including the great Gary Oldman, but this is somewhat undermined by the often false performances of Jason Clarke and Kerri Russell. Nevertheless, ""Dawn"" is an impressive follow-up to ""Rise,"" and a setting for the original ""Apes"" film starring Charlton Heston begins to be established.The story is full of sudden twists and turns and is always suspensive. SPOILER ALERT: One complaint I had initially was the manner of Koba's death and how Caesar seems to give in to an elitist attitude that deems an ape (as anthropomorphized human) no longer deserving of being considered an ""ape"" (as anthropomorphized human being). Ultimately, here Caesar falls into the same pit as his human counterparts, as well as Koba, condensing the life-sensitive worth saving. For Koba, it's just apes that serve all his whims. This is solely for many of the people themselves.Deceptively, for Caesar, it is worth saving only that life which fits his morality criteria (which is indeed a comparatively compassionate one). However, I am informed that Koba's breathing toward the credits is being heard and that the character of Caesar after his attempted execution of Koba has not been morally resolved. I still have to see the sequel: there may still be a resolution to this moral conundrum."
" One of the best sci fi films of all time.
",0.6369,0.9944,2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Dawn of the planet of the Apes is an absolute powerhouse of a movie. Even though it's five years old now the CGI is absolutely flawless, the Apes are simply characters in the film and you accept that almost immediately. It's predecessor 'rise' was an excellent film but this edges it in pretty much every department, it's visually the best of the three 'Apes' films, has the best score and storyline, which is just chock full of dilemmas and character development. The film takes the time to show you background to all the major players - ape and human, and the film is all the better for it. The cinematography is superb and the film just has this dark foreboding mood throughout - it's just excellent and I simply cannot fault it. The ending reminds me of 'The Empire Strikes Back' - it is that good. An straight 10/10 masterpiece in my view."

Stereotypical rednecks abound, and terrible decisions by people who clearly were political and intelligent enough to get the whole thing organized. So bad, I fell between not caring about the human side, and actively being happy when they got murdered.Ape side of the story was solid, much better acted, and so on. Worked great. In between were the humans who did the primary interaction with the ape society. Sometimes shockingly stupid, but on average okay.Overall story is fine, but too much dumbness for physics and geography. Not sure why the citadel is fake, why they had to mess with where things are in city of SF, why they had to add a fake dam in the North Bay somewhere ill defined, etc. So much to work with there, they could have done better. Also: radios don't take that much power. Battery + solar would be enough to talk to those they do to set up the plot for the next movie, and gensets? Easy. Etc. for other solutions. I need explanations of why wood gasification won't work, how they fuel the vehicles, where the food comes from, or the water, or... anything?"
" Great: 9.0
",0.6249,0.9799,2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"The 1968 Planet of the Apes is regarded as a science-fiction classic, combining sharp satire and Charlton Heston with one of the most well-known twist endings Hollywood has ever seen. The sequels only got crazier (and worse), and once time travel got involved, you knew that it had to stop. Then in 2011, the series got a much-needed fresh start with Rise. And now the sequel is finally here, and it is quite possibly the best film in the entire eight-film series. During the credits of Rise, there was a little sequence involving the implied spread of a virus known as the simian flu. By Dawn, that virus has all but destroyed the world, reducing the human population to around a tenth of what it once was. In San Francisco, the human colony there is running out of power, and asks the apes to allow access to the nearby dam, thus allowing the two sides to live separately, but peacefully. Of course, it's never that easy. Due to a string of events which I will not spoil here, the good acting, phenomenal visual effects, precise direction, and almost-Shakespearean script come together in a smart, visceral blockbuster that will surely be remembered as one of 2014's best films."

As a sequel to 'Rise' it feels completely different on a whole but referencing its roots enough to stay in keeping. It doesn't have a lot of action but when it does it feels epic and the effects are top drawer. The storytelling is where this movie excels, its an imaginative spin to the original movie and has some beautiful moments. This movie has the ability to make you gasp which is terrific, at times when it should feel silly in hindsight it just works effortlessly. The tempo of this movie does rely heavily on the other party not knowing something, throwing back and fourth using the same technique although this does not take away from the overall breath taking entertainment."

A community of survivors lives in the ruins of San Francisco while a tribe of very advanced apes with human-like qualities lives nearby in Muir Woods. Tensions and violence erupt between the species.Although this is a science-fiction film and had opportunities for new paradigms, the old chivalry paradigms are still used particularly in the ape community where the men do all the hunting, fighting, and governing while the women stay home and give birth to baby boys. (As an aside, why is it that nearly all on-screen births are boys? If girl children are never seen to be born, then how can there end up being mothers to give birth to baby boys?) On the human side, there is a major female character but, as usual, this number is kept to the usual maximum of one.Besides the misgivings, this is still a finely made film mainly for the special effects and the make-up prosthetics. It is also a good metaphor for current and past wars among humans. Each tribe in the film has a minority of wise people with good hearts who try to find peaceful common ground with like minds on the other side. Sadly, they are attacked for this by members of their own tribe. Does this sound familiar?With this insight on ""humanity"" and constant action, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an entertaining film."

Jason Clarke, Keri Russel, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Gary Oldman are really good.

The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. The cinematography is really good but the CGI really pisses me off for the most part except for Andy Serkis as the lead Ape Caesar because he proves that even in a motion caption suit on a green screen he can still give an Oscar worthy performance as a leader. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.

Instead, it portrays its delicate situation with nuance in a way which allows everyone's perspective to be both clear and understandable. Even the main ape antagonist, who's militant sensibilities stem from a deep-rooted mistrust in humanity established in the prior title, has reasonable and somewhat supportable motivations. Once the set-up is out of the way and the action - which is bigger in scope, spectacle and success this time - begins, the feature still keeps its focus on character and this is what allows it to remain as emotionally resonant as it really is. 9/10"

During the opening credits we quickly discover the ALZ 113 virus has killed off many humans creating a quarantine condition which for some unexplained reason caused rioting and killing off more humans. In spite of the weak plot point, it was more probable then the original dog/cat virus which lead to breeding apes with long gestation periods as pets.The film spends time building ape character with perfect English syntax subtitles. In this plot, our quarantined humans are running short on fuel and seek to restart a hydro-electric dam in ape territory and seem willing to go to war for oil, er ah, energy if need be. Koba, a neo-con ape, doesn't trust the humans and wants to have a first strike. (Koba was a nickname for Stalin.)Some of the initial soundtrack and imagery reminded me of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" with later scenes of cooperation reminiscent of the final film and TV series.

The graphic of how the simian virus spread was quite original and the opening shot of Caesar - and indeed the first 15min or so - does a great job of showing so much, without needing any talking.The setting is still Muir Woods in San Francisco, but a lot has changed, with the apes now living peacefully and successfully in the forest and the humans a desperate mess in the city. I was amazed by how quickly I was cheering for the apes and, if not despising, then at least not caring for the humans at all! Caesar (Serkis), Koba (Kebbell), Blue Eyes (Thurston) & Maurice (Konoval) are the main stars here, with Dreyfus (Oldman), Malcolm (Clarke) & Ellie (Russell) merely making up the numbers. It's great to have Serkis back as Caesar, the ""king of the Apes"", with such nuanced and believable body language and facial expressions. Hard to believe he has gone from obscurity to the world's greatest motion-capture actor in just over 10 years! He's now responsible for three of the biggest characters of all time - Caesar, King Kong & Gollum - and he'll be in 'Star Wars: Episode VII' next year!So much happens in this film - it's tense and dramatic in parts, then a full blown war in others and a political tug-of-war in others, and often times both ""sides"" are trying hard to do right, but something prevents that. It's definitely not boring and flies along, looking great, and importantly too - sounding great, with a nice score underneath and throughout.Seeing as this is the seventh film in the franchise (no one counts Burton's 2001 remake, right?), it definitely leaves you wondering and anticipating what will happen in the third of the ""prequel trilogy"" and see how they link them to the original 60s/70s films. It will also be amazing if they have the third prequel made by 2016, considering how much CGI & motion-capture detail they will need for the epic 'conclusion'..."
" An improvement from the first film in the trilogy
",0.4588,0.9935,2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a solidly good film but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes expands on everything established in that film to great effect.The film is set ten years after the events of Rise where the ALZ-113 virus has spread across the globe wiping out most of humanity. Caesar's community of apes has grown considerably, and they believe humans to have wiped each other out until two apes stumble across a human in the woods and the narrative starts to progress.What I really liked about the narrative was the dynamic of the separate communities of humans and apes, with both just wanting to do what is needed to survive. In that sense the distrust certain humans and apes had for each other was understandable, even for the villain Koba who's hatred for humans fuelled most of his actions. This was rather thought-provoking and I enjoyed how that was explored.The special effects are brilliant once again with how the apes are brought to life and appear like they are a real part of this world, and from that Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell give excellent performances as Caesar and Koba respectively. Their dynamic as contrasting characters was one of the best parts of the film, which was fulfilled in a very cathartic way with Caesar dropping Koba from a great height to his death after he had betrayed him.However, for the human characters the performances were rather bland, especially from Jason Clarke, and surprisingly Gary Oldman who is usually very assured. His character didn't have much to do in the narrative either which was a little disappointing.In the end though this was an emotionally complex second instalment to the Planet of the Apes prequel trilogy, and one that sets up the final film in an effective manner."

This edition truly humanized the apes...partly because of the approach and partly because of Serkis. I was pretty moved and engaged for the first 60 minutes or so. It eventually devolved into an ape action flick, complete with an ape Rambo...but it still mostly worked. Especially when seen as a metaphor for how humans relate (and fight) across lines of difference. I'll stick around for another sequel!"
" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: A Glorious Sequel
",0.6369,0.9885,2017-11-20 00:00:00,9,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite films. Here is why: It is heavily emotive, powerful, and dark - a worthy sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes, featuring a fine cast, superb visual effects, and a laudable score from Michael Giachinno (The Incredibles, Spiderman: Homecoming) bound together in the tale of a well-woven series of tragic misunderstandings that lead ultimately to the bloody outcome of total war (quite literally). Firstly, I'd like to comment on the plot. The beauty of the conflict between man and ape seems to be contained in the fact that neither side is truly evil, and that neither side desires war, but rather peace. Paralleling reality, war - that inevitable and inescapable fate which, by the means of often indirect and convoluted paths looms incessantly closer despite everyone's best intentions - draws men, women and children inside of it in a living tornado of human lives. Some have accused the franchise of a predictable and typical story; but consider that most of the audience is already familiar with how this story ends, making the movies more character- centered as a result. The real conundrum is not so much which race gains control of the planet, but rather where Caesar is driven morally (a theme further developed in War). As in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we are not concerning ourselves with whether the new Death Star survives the rebels' attack, so much as we are concerning ourselves with the fate of our characters - will Kylo Ren accept Han Solo's invitation to renounce evil and return home? The plot is relatively simple, yet soulful and meaningful.As a means of countering repetition of my previous review on Rise, I shall tend to be brief on matters I've already addressed. Our new ensemble of actors is refreshing, and lends the movie a new context. Enough recognizable faces reprise their roles as familiar characters such as Caesar, Maurice, Koba and Rocket; yet, we are treated to a whole, fresh crew including Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, Jason Clarke's Malcolm, Keri Russell's Ellie and Kodi Smit-Mcphee's Alexander. Though our new human protagonists are comparable to our previous ones, they differ so much as to add something quite new to the trilogy. The movie maintains fine general character continuity, and they fit nicely into the synopsis, without becoming too centrepiece, which I admire. Dreyfus especially provides abundant material for thought. He is a villain wrought by misunderstanding and circumstance - not entirely culpable for his actions, which, owing to his ignorance, he sees as the only logical path to take. He was originally a family man, not a war general or governor of thousands. Again, misunderstandings pave the way for ruin. Perhaps my only criticism here would be Alexander's lack of pertinence to the overall story. He was intriguing, yet in retrospect, feels unexplored. In the face of the sequel, seemingly his and his family's history was cut tragically short, leaving little room for imagination to conjure a future for him.Visual effects have improved notably since Rise, and Matt Reeve's recent comment on them is worthy of note. To paraphrase, he pointed out that Weta is often straining itself to reach new heights as movies are made. If a particular texture or metaphysical reaction is required for a movie such as this one, hitherto unaccomplished feats are then nominated order of the day. Thus capabilities are stretched and extended with each new production. An understanding of this can perhaps aid viewers in assessing the state and stage of progression we are in - as always, we are constantly making rapid advancements in technological areas. Another noteworthy item is the amount of work involved in creating these visual effects. For instance, one of Dawn's most complicated visual effects-heavy shots was rendered a total of 1200+ times, and completed only a couple of weeks before the movie opened in cinemas. Meanwhile, Giachinno's score meshed well with the tone of the movie - dark, deep, powerful (though minimal), tribal and occasionally rather mischievous.Finally, I want to give a word on Matt Reeves' expert directorship on this film and in general. The biggest reason the Apes trilogy resonates so effectively with its enthusiasts is the priority Reeves gives to the emotional connection the audience shares with the main protagonist (i.e. Caesar). He likes often to talk of this intimacy, and of the internal emotional and moral struggles that occur inside Caesar (and hopefully Batman, given a few years down the track). A second thing - Reeves directs movies not like a business, but like a passion. He isn't afraid to experiment, and seems to really care about the story he presents. Maybe there lies the key to why his movies are as powerful are they are. And maybe in ten years' time Matt Reeves will be a common household name. My final point is Reeves' apparent zeal for building and shooting on large sets, constructed largely from natural resources (as opposed to green-screening the movie into existence), thus really bringing the movie's fictional world into reality - resembling the typical Christopher Nolan style, which I also much appreciate. In closing, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of my all-time favourite movies, ranking quite closely to its predecessor, and I highly recommend it to anyone who values a gripping narrative, gorgeous visuals, and superb acting wrapped together in a powerful film. I have seen it about five times since its 2014 release, and I plan on many more viewings. The trilogy is mostly solid the whole way through, and all three films are worth your time. If you love film and have yet to watch it, you're certainly missing out."
" A poignant and dark, post-apocalyptic epic...
",0.0,0.9865,2017-11-06 00:00:00,10,"A poignant and dark, post-apocalyptic epic with exceptional acting, phenomenal cinematography, and ground-breaking visual effects.Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell, Karin Konoval, and Jason Clarke lend their incredible acting talent to Matt Reeves' wonderful direction and writing, and Michael Seresin's outstanding cinematography. They create a rich, detailed world of loss and yearning and create immense tension between the humans and apes. The characters are so well- written and instantly create an emotional connection with the audience. Caesar is easily one of my favorite movie characters of all time and the same goes for Koba. Dawn is an incredibly deep and enthralling masterpiece about apes that's surprisingly human.10/10**Took me several viewings to fully appreciate Dawn**"
" Apes vs Humans
",0.0,0.7713,2017-10-25 00:00:00,7,"The apes are back once again, and this time they are riding horses. They also have automatic weapons. The apes are led by Caesar, a really smart monkey who speaks English. Andy Serkis is the actor under all the makeup and he is excellent. The only recognizable actress is Keri Russell, best known for the TV series, Felicity. The apes live near a dam which is needed by the humans for electricity. Of course, it all leads to a bloody war between the two groups. The scenery is spectacular and the script well written. The biggest problem is the two hour and ten minute running time. The film is just too long. Otherwise, it is a pretty good movie."
" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Review
",0.0,0.996,2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"After the ending of the first film, I was hoping they would make a sequel so that we could see where the story would go next, luckily in 2014 we got exactly that, and it didn't disappoint. When I heard that Wyatt was retiring as a director in this franchise, I got a bit nervous because whenever you change directors within a franchise, I can either work really well or really bad, but then I heard that they hired Matt Reeves to direct the sequel, the same man who directed Cloverfield and Let Me In, that gave me a bit more confidence in the sequel. Matt Reeves did one heck of a job directing this movie, is stunning, the cinematography is just beautiful. Andy Serkis is once again great as Caesar and Toby Kebbell was also fantastic as Koba, once again the human characters played by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell, while giving good performances, the writing of their characters never made them as interesting as the apes, but that is also because the people playing the apes are that good. I really like the story and how is executed, a lot of things you'd think would be predictable in a movie like this, are done in ways you wouldn't expect. I really think Dawn is up there with T2 and The Dark Knight as one of those few sequels that don't just live up to it's predecessor, it excels it."
" An improvement on Rise
",0.4588,-0.3103,2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,"An improvement on Rise, that film's sci-fi ambitions a tad undercooked. Here the focus is on psychology. Koba is a great villain, with a strong performance from Toby Kebbell who has some hilarious ""playing"" dumb-ape scenes that are perfect - until he becomes a simplistic power hungry mad hatter at the end. He was broken by the world and thought he was helping the apes, then suddenly at the end he becomes simply insane and angry. The other ""villain"", Gary Oldman, is vastly underwritten - in fact the humans are in general. This film is less about a rift between humans and apes then it is about Caesar realizing apes aren't just inherently good because they're apes and not humans. I wish the ending were tighter in general and the human dilemma equal to the apes."
" A War Movie More Than Anything
",-0.5994,0.8644,2017-08-20 00:00:00,4,"This is the first (of probably several) sequels to the 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" that rebooted the series. At first it seems to work pretty well, taking up basically at exactly the point the previous movie left off (albeit ten years later) with the apes living in the forest outside San Francisco. They've progressed nicely, have built a nice home for themselves, and have learned sign language (which does seem more realistic than having them speaking fluent English would have been - although Caesar and his rival Koba do have some linguistic abilities.) Caesar is in charge of the ape society and everything seems more or less good with them. Not going so well, though, is human life. The simian virus has killed millions and there are a few stragglers left in the city, who are running short of power after all this time, and decide that they could make use of a dam to power their homes. Unfortunately, the dam in right in the middle of ape territory - and the apes are none too happy about having humans around.This is a movie about confrontations. Most obvious is the confrontation between the apes and the humans. Neither like or trust the other. Humans still see the intelligent apes as just plain animals, while many apes remember and resent their treatment at the hands of humans. Obviously, the human move into ape territory is going to lead to conflict, and that conflict takes up a good part of the movie. But there's also the confrontation between Caesar and Koba - another ape who thinks that Caesar is far too kind and sympathetic to humans - and a battle emerges between the two of them for the leadership of the ape community. As it turns out, intelligent apes are pretty much like humans. They want their own way, and eventually power and brute force determines which one gets their way. Those things make this a pretty dark movie when compared to the original.Somehow, this movie didn't really grab me. I have to admit that I even fell asleep for about 10 or 15 minutes and wasn't interested enough to go back to see what I missed, although after I woke up I did manage to stick it out to the end. I liked the original reboot. I found it very thoughtful and thought-provoking. But aside from the Caesar-Koba battle and the reflection on power and corruption, this movie lacked some of that thoughtfulness. In many ways, this became a war movie more than anything, with apes attacking the human city. The human characters are all completely new. There are no holdovers from the original movie. I did miss James Franco from that first installment. In this, Jason Clarke plays the main human character, but Malcolm didn't connect with me the way Franco's Will did. In fact, none of the human characters really seemed well enough developed to mean anything to a viewer. And - as I said about the first movie - somehow the CGI apes don't really connect with me either.I didn't expect this to be as good as ""Rise"" - and it wasn't. It was too much of a war movie filled with battles. (4/10)"
" The Best In The Trilogy
",0.6369,0.9921,2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"So after seeing War for the planet of the apes, i thought i would watch the last two to get a better look on how War fits into the perfect trilogy. And after revisiting Rise which was great, i saw this movie again and i personally think is not only the best in the trilogy, but one of the best sci-fi films this century has to date. Dawn of the planet of the apes takes place 10 years after the ape leader Caesar leads a revolt against the humans and frees his imprisoned apes. And in this one we see the apes create a civilization and things are going pretty well. Until a colony of humans are discovered and both groups struggle to maintain peace. First of all, this movie improves greatly over the 1st one with CGI and it looks amazing. We also see more characterization from Caesar and also some human characters. This movie also gave 2014 the best movie villain.... Koba. He was just great and he did things that were terrible but you also understood why he does what he does. The conflict between Caesar and Koba is just perfectly well done. We have a character that wants both groups to live side by side, and we have a character that just acts out of fear and vengeance. The plot is amazingly well done and there is not one dull moment (that i found anyways). The score is also epic. I better stop talking how great this movie is, sorry i do have a habit to talk a lot. If i was going to pick out one little flaw it would be that the human characters are not as interesting as the apes. I wasn't bored when the were on screen, i just found myself not as engaged as when Caesar, Koba, or any of the apes were on screen. But that is just a little flaw, it doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece. So in the end, Dawn of the planet of the apes is a masterpiece in every possible way. I loved it when i saw it in 2014, and it kinda grew on me as i watched it again. The action was amazing, the characters were well done, the score had me on edge, and the plot always had my attention. A+ or 10/10If i was gonna rank these movies it would go like this: 1. Dawn of the planet of the apes 2. War for the planet of the apes 3. Rise of the planet of the apes"

" Apes on horseback, what's not to like? Well...
",-0.2755,-0.9125,2017-08-08 00:00:00,5,"This is a visually compelling movie which attempts to illustrate how much easier it is to start a war than keep a peace. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by a bright 5th grader with no idea of how anything works. Every scene has a couple logical or continuity problems which are annoying if you know anything about power grids, power plants, tunnels and explosives, antibiotics, the climate of California, the distribution of power plants in California or the flora and fauna of Muir Woods. The only thing to eat there for apes would be banana slugs, and not once do they show the inside of one of those sequoias, which is just a shame. Ironically, the film makers have decided not to give the apes clothes, making them into Ken dolls instead, but even an ape is going to want a jacket in Muir woods on a rainy day. No primate, human or otherwise, is going to stay in that part of the bay area without ocean trade. Of course, San Jose wouldn't look very compelling covered with ivy and poison oak, but at least it has arable land and the sun shines. However, many of the negative reviews forget that in this series the intelligence of the apes is not evolutionary, but comes from the deus ex machina of a magic virus that makes you smart, but then kills you if you are human, but not if you are an ape. For this film, this is logical consistency.More annoying are the uncharacteristic things done by people and apes just to move the plot forward and create formulaic dramatic situations. We know so much about ape psychology that the idea that more than a dozen chimps could live together peaceably is nonsense. ""Ape no kill other ape""? Not likely. Also, if you met a talking ape, wouldn't you try to talk to it? And not once does anyone point out that humans are apes. At least the intellectual is still an orangutan. Gary Oldmans character is better drawn than the reviews would make you think and there are a couple cute scenes, but mostly you have to suppress the thought, ""Why are they doing that?""."
" The Dawn For A Superior Sequel
",0.5423,0.9985,2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"I can't say I loved Rise of The Planet of The Apes but I enjoyed it for what it was and left me excited for what was to come next and Dawn of The Planet of The Apes met my expectations by improving on Rise and being much more of a character based drama from all perspectives. The thing that carries this film is it well rounded characters, both ape and human alike. I didn't matter what species they were because they were so well developed it allowed you to see things from the perspective of every character and it became increasingly difficult to choose what side to support. Even when some did something that you couldn't support it was still easy to understand their choices and feel something for the characters who made them. All the performances in this film were excellent Andy Serkis continues to prove that he is an actor like no other he just perfectly nails the heart and soul of Caesar and there could not have been a more perfect choice to play him. Toby Kebbell has never really impressed me but I have to say I loved him in this movie, he nailed Koba's rougher and more damaged nature and makes it clear how much similar Caesar could have been to him had his upbringing been ever so slightly different. Jason Clarke was very good in this movie, he was very easy to get behind and never felt as if he was out of place. Gary Oldman was fantastic in this movie he easily gave the best performance of the human cast with the way he made you feel sympathy for his character. This film looks stunning and lot darker and more dreary than Rise but that feels appropriate for the darker tone this film is trying to convey. The world feels and looks as if it has been through hell and never makes you second guess that it has. The filmmakers really set the darker tone for the movie very early one and I loved that about this movie, its ability to go much darker when it needs to and always feels appropriate when it goes down that path. Matt Reeves directed this movie in a phenomenal way, he's great and showing scale as well as scope, he has a keen eye for action sequences which are all fantastic and nothing less than believable. The CGI for the apes is again spectacular, you feel as if you truly are watching walking and talking apes, thanks to the special effects in equal parts to the actors who so perfectly portray them. My biggest issue with this movie, like Rise, is the material for the human characters. Like I said they establish them very well and all make understandable choice the problem is that there story was just simply never as interesting. The arguing and tension among them felt quite standard and less interesting in comparison to the apes and the whole plot set up the repair the damn never really went anywhere. This new trilogy had consistently surprised me, I like them all a hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would and has always given me plenty to think about while I am watching them. This film looks amazing, has fantastic direction, well rounded characters with superb interaction between them. Despite some issues with the human characters I find myself enjoying this franchise more and more with every new release. 8.7/10: A- (Fantastic)"
" Rating: A
",0.0,0.9991,2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"The first film clearly elevated the franchise to a very high level of quality, but it still had its flaws ... Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes those issues and solves them while improving everything else that was already great!Once again, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is an outstanding character! It's amazing how I feel so connected to an ape, a very powerful, emotional ape that leaves me at the edge of my seat every time he's in action. Andy Serkis deserves every Oscar there is for his unbelievable performance, he is, without a single doubt, the best motion capture actor ever! What a role!If there's another standout from this second installment, it is definitely Koba (Toby Kebbell). He steals every scene he's in! He's great when fighting and he's very passionate about his perspective on the human race, something that is very well explained and demonstrated throughout the film, giving this character the reason behind his ""evil"" personality.Also, this time around the human characters got a little more development than on the first movie, as it can be seen on Jason Clarke's great portrayal of Malcolm, who brings the emotional human- ape relationship to some very compelling and captivating moments.The visual effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. I mean, there are close-up scenes to an ape's face ... That seems like a freaking real ape! It's that good! In addition to this, the action is awesome and there's a lot more of it than on the previous film. When it goes down, IT GOES DOWN! Just incredible direction from Matt Reeves, congratulations for an extraordinary work!I only have a couple of minor issues: once again, the pacing is a little bit slow, but it did improve compared to the first movie. Some human characters are just assholes because the plot demands them to, instead of being the script (which is also a bit expositional) to justify their actions. However, these are very minor problems that I have with this amazing film!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes improves on everything Rise has: marvelous visual effects, well-developed characters (apes and humans), awesome action and a captivating story, with an astounding amount of emotion and compelling moments during the whole runtime. Matt Reeves' direction is near perfection and Andy Serkis declares, once and for all, that he is, in fact, the best motion capture actor ever!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Creative, interesting and entertaining

The CGI is easily the strongest and best aspect of the film, it adds a great degree of realism to the film and we feel we really are seeing a conflict between man and ape. We see sophisticated apes who are capable of building a world or ecosystem of their own and having their own society. It also showed how the apes and humans were not so different and both were capable of deception. It had elements of Shakespearean plays with its emphasis on power, deception and ascending towards it. The film was easy to understand and entertaining to its end. It also nicely left the door open to a sequel. 7.5/10"
" Perspective & Possibility: A Shakespearean Spectacle
",0.0,0.9973,2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an ambitious, nuanced, commanding endeavor. Though I find more enjoyment in the rampant momentum of Rise, Dawn is admittedly the better film--far more realized in allegory and character, despite falling short of its predecessor on less-consequential facets. Matt Reeves is perhaps the best director we could have possibly received for this film, and his efforts pay off spectacularly.Reeves is not only a long time fan of Planet of the Apes, but he understands all its layers and nuances (as revealed via audio commentary). Overall, Dawn is more slowly- paced than Rise, yet no less mesmerising. The production design by James Chinlund thrives with history--all scenes but the skyscraper sequence were actually shot on a physical set or location, and the film breathes with natural lighting (including burning down the ape village set for real). There's a constant undercurrent of character-driven intensity from the apes in this film, and a level of technical innovation and ambition that's nigh-comparable to the likes of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings. We're talking shooting motion-capture in the mud and rain, sometimes shooting over a thousand takes, and monumental undertakings in editing. The craftsmanship here is unparalleled.Director of photography Michael Seresin seems like a perfect successor to develop Lesnie's window/cage motif from Rise, seeing as how ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" highlights his repertoire. Unfortunately, I didn't notice much in the way of symbolic sensibilities besides that of Caesar's face opening/closing the film. Nonetheless, the shots are often beautiful and thriving with scope. The effects by WETA are even more astonishing than before, and there's no competition for their accomplishments here.I have problems with select aspects of the direction though, such as elements of the combat sequences, but primarily, disparities within overall scope. Part of this film is trying to tell an epic, but another part of it is relaying a humble, transitionary story. That's a compelling idea in its own right, but sometimes the confines of the world got to me--with connective sequences from the ape village to the bridge to the human compound, making the world feel somewhat small despite the massive implications of the preceding pandemic. I'll also admit that though one-handed machine-gun-wielding apes-on-horseback are awesome, it's a stretch of reality. You can reasonably assume they reload off-camera, but still. . . . If anything drags in this movie, it's the battle sequences--as the real focal point of tension is the characters, and these sequences feel like a digression sometimes. Some more minor flaws include a handful of clichés, such as the introductory montage and opening/closing on Caesar's face, though are effective (or even powerful) within their individual contexts.The initial screenplay was written by Rise's duo Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, later revised by Mark Bomback and Reeves himself when he entered the project. Though the plot's admittedly a cliché (taking after classic westerns), there's still a lot to praise. Foremost, there's the Shakespearean tragedy: Koba and Caesar, the story about two brothers (as distinguished by Reeves), their clashing philosophies, and inevitable betrayal. If you look closely, you'll also find a meticulous illustration of duality: Caesar and Koba, Malcolm and Dreyfus, humans and apes. . . . war and peace. This film is a multifaceted study on perspective and delusions of infallibility, exhibiting an entire spectrum of viewpoints across a spectrum of affiliations, articulating shades of grey that would normally be presented as a false dichotomy. In this we get a series of reversals, such as humans and apes alike struggling to stay united, humans realizing that they are too animalistic, and apes realizing they are too human. All of this is churning inside the beautiful, fleeting moment in which peace is a possibility.This film also delves back into the franchise's signature sociopolitical commentary, with some light content on gun violence, racism, and international relations. It's still not quite as intricate as 1968's masterpiece, but it's worthy of the Planet of the Apes title.Rise developed a thriving history behind Caesar that Dawn builds off of excellently. Caesar is a character defined by an internal study of duality: belonging to two worlds, and hence belonging truly to neither, dooming him to a certain sense of isolation. The apes on screen thrive with depth in their dawning civilization, and though apes can't physiologically produce vocalized speech or tears, these stretches of reality are executed mostly tastefully. The human characters however present an interesting flaw, in which I sympathise with them, but I don't especially ""care"" about them. They work well in their depiction of an emotional reality, and within their role in the film's themes, but they simply aren't as individually complex and emotive as the apes (which was a near-impossible balance to strike in the first place, given the context).The human performance highlights are Oldman and Russell. Clarke is competent, despite a sometimes dry chemistry with the other actors. The only truly iffy ape performance for me was Thurston, who at times felt emotionally constipated--but besides that, the apes are great! Karin Konoval is delightful and has a touching scene with Kodi Smit-McPhee. Kebbel delivers a heartbreaking performance as Koba, exhibiting a perfectly messy fusion of hurt, anger, restraint, and obsession. Serkis is truthfully just as riveting without the CG, having seen behind-the-scenes footage. He's an incredible motion-capture actor because he's an incredible actor. That's all there is to it.I don't like Giacchino's score as much as Doyle's (and I really wish he made an effort for thematic continuity), but it's still better than your average film score. The orchestration feels a little thin at times, or like a score to an animated movie, but the darker segments are fantastic--especially where Giacchino delves into more avant- garde, Jerry Goldsmith-influenced sensibilities. This is easily one of the best Apes films, and is solidifying what's looking to be one hell-of-a trilogy.Score: 9/10"
" One last chance for peace.
",0.6705,0.9995,2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Right after Rise of the Planet of the Apes one already knew that the story would continue, and that's where Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has come by. And if Rise of the Planet of the Apes only had come by in the same manner that any superhero origin story would have played out by setting up the tone for films yet to come, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes already has found itself more room to create a more distinctive identity. But being as I've never particularly been the hugest fan of the original film franchise, it's nice to see that these new films are able to form an identity of their own for it takes me by surprise how much I enjoy them. These aren't just mindless, disposable blockbusters that only find themselves living within the moment, these films leave behind an impact that calls out for far more - among many reasons I'm glad these new Planet of the Apes movies are around.The ending of Rise of the Planet of the Apes already begged for more questions to be asked in regards to what was only going to be made of mankind's future as the apes have only found themselves growing in spontaneous numbers. The Simian flu has already decimated the human population whereas Caesar and the other enhanced apes are already making a community for themselves, attempting to live at peace away from the humans. Perhaps answers to questions being asked about whether or not the humans and apes will find themselves able to live within peace is only going to leave behind predictable answers, and yet it doesn't make the final product any less riveting for what it is - it also feels rewarding just watching how everything will build up. For as the first chapter had focused on how the apes had found themselves coming to be, this one only had found itself sitting within a broader canvas and thus the fact it calls for more possibilities only makes an exciting product.In contrast to Rupert Wyatt's efforts behind telling the story present in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves coming into the director's chair has only found itself beneficial. For as functional as Rupert Wyatt's efforts may have been in allowing a story to come and set itself in motion, Reeves, best known at the time for Cloverfield and Let Me In, creates a far more distinguishing approach that not only has resulted in a better film than its predecessor, but has also left behind one of the better blockbusters in recent memory. Many of the highlights that we remember perfectly from the predecessor, whether it be Andy Serkis's performance as Caesar or the visual effects (although they are evidently more advanced in here) come back to shine, yet not without the clear calling for more because of the canvas that Reeves has created on the screen.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes finds itself spending far more time with its human characters while allowing the story of the apes to breathe in a life of their own. Because of this, it is easier to get a grasp on its own characters' motivations whether it range from Caesar's attempts to come at peace with the humans or Dreyfus's intention to wipe out their race to preserve humanity. In addition to having far more compelling human characters a cast that ranges from Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, and Jason Clarke, far more compelling antagonist motivations are present that ultimately allow for a greater character study all the way through because Reeves doesn't blindly paint these characters as villains for the sake of moving forward. In Gary Oldman's Dreyfus we still feel a great resentment towards his own actions because of what measures he would take to preserve his own kind, and at the same time within Koba we have actions that make sense from perspective. They aren't ""bad"" by nature, but that's why they've ever managed to leave behind a great impact with their own roles.Yet despite having so much more working efforts than Rise of the Planet of the Apes, somehow it also comes out as more expository. I appreciate how these films don't blindly go about with painting the human race within a single-sided light, but with the obvious political allegory having already been established - one aspect in which I find myself getting more critical of Dawn comes by, it has already painted within a broader and darker canvas because it has found itself free to roam after an origin story had already been set up, but it only comes to repeat a message already having been told, thus in part it finds itself losing a sense of its own identity. Sure, there's far more that I appreciate in the narrative that Matt Reeves has created as opposed to what Rupert Wyatt had presented only as a means of getting something done and over with, but a greater feeling of separation even from its own predecessors would also be much appreciated out of these films.Functioning as a sequel, what Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is servicing comes more than just as one film continuing what its predecessor has already established wonderfully. Even if it may seem more expository, there's still no denying that its freedom has also created what can easily be seen as a more confident and engaging affair altogether. These go beyond exciting action sequences and outstanding visual effects work, because Dawn of the Planet of the Apes also works beautifully in how it approaches its own characters with how they have come to be. In an age where one can dismiss blockbusters as being tiresome and repetitive, what Matt Reeves has presented with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is more than just exciting storytelling, it is fantastic blockbuster filmmaking all around."
" A mouth full of a title but great film none the lest.
",0.7684,0.9256,2017-07-20 00:00:00,8,"Dawn takes place 10 years after the events of Rise and we see who the societies of both the Apes and the Human around the area of San Francisco live after most of humanity has vanished due to the event of the previous film. With the Apes becoming more organized and progress , while their fearless relatives struggle to survive.And here is where your film begins are the to groups try to define the borders of their domains and co-exist peacefully in this new world. However prejudice from both sides set the stage for the battle for supremacy. And what I like with these films is the the effects are here to help the story become real ,unlike with the Transformers in which the effects are in the spotlight and the story, characters, themes and good writing are left out, here is almost the reverse.To our main ape Ceasar, damn ,from pet to revolutionary to leader and father he has quit a life and in him we see the best of both world come together and make one of the best character of modern movie history. As for the humans ,you feel that they are desperate and in all honesty they lack the necessary skills in order to survive with out the comforts of heirs society before its collapse. Also we see that they have difficulty accepting that the apes next to them aren't just animals but intelligent beings with families of their own. From the apes point of view there are some of them who share ironically the same distrust with the human due to their previous treatment from them. In short who is to blame... both!In total a good and thoughtful look to the theme of distrust of ""the other"" and who our own faults blind us to see what is best for us."
" A huge filmmaking achievement
",0.3182,0.9859,2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"If Rise successfully quoted the original 1968 film and introduced a new take on the Planet of the Apes series, Dawn manages to set things in motion the right way, and is far superior its predecessor. The story is set 10 years after a pandemic apocalypse. A familiar premise to post-apoc films, to be sure, but it isn't zombies that the survivors have to face. It is Caesar's highly organised tribe. The story reminds me once again on almost an ""Animal Farm"" take, with apes behaving quite similarly to humans, because, as Caesar says, apes are similar to humans even though he hoped not. Therefore Caesar, Koba and several others behave very humanly, each having their own motivations for their acts. I like how Rocket's role was further developed after what he was in ""Rise"". Similarly human characters are portrayed without a distinction between good or bad, but more likely between protagonists and antagonists. Dreyfuss' motivations are made quite clear.What is even more surpirising, is that half of the characters appear as Computer Generated Imagery. The photorealism is outstandingly convincing, and the mo-cap actors (with Serkis on the lead) could convey through this technology all their talent as well as the other actors.Generally, I really appreciated photography in this film. Some of the shots where outstanding, and there where a few single-take scenes (which, however, didn't last more than a minute of uncut footage or so). Even if much of what you can see on screen in CG, this is a remarkable achievement.The only weak point was the score. I can recognise clearly when I hear a Giacchino score because his ""emotional scene"" theme is almost the same in every movie or TV Show he scored since Lost, partially probably due to the enormous quantity of work he has to do.This is one of the best post-apoc films of the decade. I strongly hope the conclusion of this first trilogy will be as good as this film was, if not better."
" Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
",0.0,-0.9497,2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"When was the last time you were watching a big budget summer blockbuster and in the first fifteen minutes, the characters and their relationships were established without any spoken dialogue, all while keeping your interest? ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" had the difficult task of telling a serious, live action, relatable, human story, despite most of its main characters being apes. This was a technical challenge because they needed to use motion capture technology to transform tons of human actors into realistic looking apes with believable movements, yet the performances of the actors playing the apes and the CGI are both incredibly natural most of the time. This was a narrative challenge because they needed to find out the best way to communicate the thoughts of the apes, yet they managed to make their actions speak for them and their few words hold so much more weight. This was a financial challenge because of the high budget needed to make the film and the general publics willingness to read subtitles, yet they managed to keep them engaged.Again and again, Matt Reeves continued to exceed my expectations with this film, not only making me genuinely care about a bunch of apes, but by telling a smart allegorical tale about racism, war, and technology's role in humanity. You don't have to see the first film in order to see this one, since all the exposition you need is cut together in a clever montage showing the downfall of humanity and the rise of the apes, allowing this film to stand on its own. After humanity began to fall from the virus, the apes became independent in the forest and began living creating their own civilization, while, unbeknownst to them, a group of immune humans lives near by, trying to restore their civilization by holding the belief that electricity will help them get back to the place they were before. When the last resort to power their city is by using water, they are forced to come into contact with the apes that are living on the dam, and tensions begin to arise.The visceral, emotional climax of this film is incredibly shot, with many long tracking or panning shots showing the all out pandemonium happening around them, as well as an intense, hand to hand fight scene, all done with almost entirely CGI characters.The film delves surprisingly deep into the origins and hypocrisy of war, showing how preconceived notions start fear and hostility, which fosters more fear and hostility, which blinds one side from the good people in the opposing group, and blinds one group from the bad people in their own group. It also shows how even the possession of weapons just causes more paranoia, causing the other group to feel the need to protect themselves with weapons, pulling both groups further and further apart from each other, despite how similar they may be."
" Stunning, action packed and yet intelligent
",0.6808,0.998,2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"A fantastic sequel to an already great reboot. The people behind these films have really done well to put new life into a dated series, while still holding high regard for their predecessors. Where the first film concentrates on the evolution of the apes and remained very intimate in tone, albeit building to something bigger by the end, 'Dawn..' takes an entirely different approach with an action packed but still very intelligent blockbuster. The effects are absolutely fantastic. There is a subtlety to the apes that works a treat. Not overdoing the human characteristics so as to become cartoon-like or cheesy, but also showing the significant changes in their behaviour as they gradually become more human. This is especially well done in Caesar and Koba. The visuals elsewhere are equally stunning with a demolished San Francisco done perfectly with a mix of CGI and effective set design. The first sequence, concerning a hunt in the woods is instantly riveting and you can't help at marvel at the fluidity of the action. This is also evident in some later sequences as the inevitable war breaks out (well..we all know how its gonna end). The human cast do well in their various roles with nothing too taxing expected of them. Slightly more significant roles from Gary Oldman and Jason Clarke are performed with conviction and you can genuinely get behind either of their goals (whichever one you may choose). Maximum praise should be given to Andy Serkis once again. His understanding and grasp of motion capture, and his ability to give such incredible performances, while in the guise of all manner of creatures, continues to impress and astound. He is able to give such raw emotional depth to Caesar as a character that he is almost human. Which I suppose is the point. On the other hand, his total immersion into the animal side of Caesar, with his movement and body language, reminds you that you are still watching a chimp. The line is balanced perfectly and Serkis is fully in command. His performance is believable and completely committed. Credit is also due to Toby Kebbell as the man behind Koba. I really enjoyed the entire experience of watching this film. It was dark and tense in parts, touching at times and the action was visceral and exciting. There are some beautiful shots throughout with real world effects and CGI so seamless that at times, you cannot actually tell them apart. Can't wait to see where they take this franchise..."
" My Favorite Planet of the Ape Film!
",0.5093,0.9953,2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Dawn of The Planet of The Apes, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the year and is definitely superior to the previous movie. Rise of The Planet of The Apes, while a good movie, did come off as a bit too simplistic, contrived, and black and white. It also felt a little to derivative. I felt like I have been here before. The CG, while good overall, looked a bit off at times. Fortunately Dawn has none of these things. With this film, it is clear, they have learned from their mistakes.This film takes place at least a decade after the previous film. The majority of humanity has been wiped out by the virus set-up in Rise. There some survivors. The ones we focus on is a small colony in San Francisco. We also follow Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his colony of apes as we see how they have thrived since the previous movie and have formed society of their own. Soon the two groups meet and the tension begins to rise. Now Caesar and the main human, Malcolm (Jason Clarke), and his family try to avoid all-out war.This film is near perfect, if not perfect. The cinematography is amazing. This is a beautiful looking film. The CGI is flawless, and is much better than in Rise. I also love the action scenes. The only action scene in Rise is at the end on the bridge. Here there is much more action and it's done beautifully. I also like how this film doesn't take any lines or story elements from the original franchise like Rise did, and stood as its own piece.The characters are good too. I like the main human characters. They weren't especially interesting, but I didn't dislike any of them either. Caesar and the apes are definitely what make this film. I especially love Caesar's rivalry with another ape named Koba. I also like Caesar's relationship with his son and how that is resolved.I also enjoyed the story this time around. I like how Caesar and Malcom are constantly trying to maintain peace while there others in both camps who want war and will what it takes to start it. I also like how the film doesn't really take a side here. In Rise it is clear you are supposed to side with the apes and that the humans are bad. Every human in that film besides James Franco's character is portrayed as narrow-minded, ignorant, bullies, or just stereo-typically evil. This film could have easily gone that route, but, thankfully, they didn't. Here there is a balance. There are bad humans but there are also bad apes who want to exterminate humans. I like how this film not so black and white says that the apes can be just as bad as the humans instead of just siding with either the humans or the apes.Overall, if you are a fan of Planet of The Apes, want to see a good summer movie, or just want to see a good film in the theater than this is a must see. I recommend watching Rise of The Planet of The Apes first if you haven't. Even if you do not like that film I still say to give this a watch."
" A sequel to a scifi movie that matches or even surpasses its predecessor ?!
",0.0,0.9973,2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is remember fondly because 'Return of the King' was a cinematic masterpiece and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was great origins story. 'The Two Towers' does not get talked about as much as the first and the third, however it plays a supremely critical role of carrying the story forward, building upon it in a meaningful way and setting up the stage for a grand finale.That is exactly what 'Dawn of Apes' does as well.We were treated to a realistic and masterful adaptation of a classic sci-fi franchise in 'Rise of Apes'. 'Dawn of Apes' bears the brunt of improving upon that masterpiece easily. It tells a story, both emotional and exciting about how Caesar tries hard to make a home for his new colony of intelligent Apes, knowing full well that the cruel human race wont let them live by themselves so easily. But the undoing of peace is caused as often by enemies within as by external foes.This is a thrilling tale that begins with tolerance, attempts at peace, friendship, then betrayal from within and finally an unavoidable descent into war. It is aided along expertly by Andy Serkis who by now has to start getting at least Oscar Nominations for his work with motion capture. Because, while the special effects themselves are spectacular throughout the movie, it is ultimately Serkis's mastery of acting that breathe life into the Caesar and make us think we are witnessing a very very real character.The performances from the other Apes, primarily Toby Kebbel as Koba, and from Jason Clarke are themselves quite excellent and keep the audiences on-edge till the very end of the movie by truly immersing the audience into an intriguing narrative. Little would you expect to be so captivated in the drama by CGI Apes! The plot itself is so well crafted, it lends credence to the violent third act, which in another movie, would have been dismissed as meaningless exaggeration.A separate note on the CGI itself: it is so well done that you might as well believe they brought in real Apes, gave them some real brain-enhancing serum and they actually acted in front of the camera ! A true masterpiece of motion capture, led by the man himself, Andy Serkis. The other special effects used to make up a post-apocalyptic San Fransisco are equally worthy of mention. The entire world feels alive in a way that helps immerse the audience in the story.So, to sum it up, not only does this film move the Ape trilogy forward but also offers a complete stand-alone sci-fi experience. A worthy successor to a worthy reboot!"
" An amazing sequel to a reboot prequel and addition to the Apes franchise
",0.5859,-0.9017,2017-07-15 00:00:00,8,"The sequel to the reboot prequel uses the amazing motion capture technology to bring a darker backstory to the original classic. Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads a society of apes that hunt and live in the redwood forests. During a hunt, a bear attacks Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and Caesar nearly dies fighting it but Koba (Toby Kebbell) saves him. When humans stumble upon the apes' home, Caesar speaks, telling them to go. He sends Koba after them to follow. The group of humans is led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who returns to the human settlement in San Francisco to tell the leader of the human society Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) about the apes. Carver (Kirk Acevedo) shot one of the apes and fears what the apes can do. Ellie (Keri Russell) used to research the disease that wiped out most of humanity at the CDC but sees no signs of any further contagion. Malcolm's son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) left behind a sketch book allowing the apes to see the extent of the society. Koba, recalling the ill treatment in the labs, believes they should attack the humans but Caesar cautions against war.Caesar leads a show of force to the gates of the human society and tells them that he does not want a war. Dreyfus is ready to go to war but Malcolm pleads with him to let him go up there and reason with Caesar. He has to take Carver along since he knows the how the power works at the dam. At the apes' fortress, Malcolm is brought to Caesar. Despite Koba's doubts, Caesar lets Malcolm show the dam to the apes. Dreyfus sends men to the armory and Koba sneaks into it though he is caught by a soldier. The men are caught off guard when Koba plays stupid. Caesar has a family to worry about as well and does not want to sacrifice apes in a needless war. He allows Malcolm and the other humans to work on the dam. The apes save the humans lives when an accident leaves some of them trapped in a tunnel but a tense altercation with a baby chimp, Blue Eyes, and Carver shows that trust is still difficult between the species.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" A seriously impressive sequel
",0.3818,0.9977,2017-07-07 00:00:00,10,"'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes' was released in cinemas in 2014, and is the sequel to the surprisingly impressive 2011 hit movie 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes'. Set 10 years later, and the world spreading disease that is hinted at in the end credits scene of 'Rise Of' has wiped out most of the human population, the apes have grown in both numbers and intelligence, and live on the outskirts of San Francisco as a community led by Caesar. With no interaction between humans and apes for so long all seems well, but the remaining humans in the city are struggling as the power source they need is dwindling and the only hope is to reroute power from a hydroelectric dam back to the city. Only the ape community now live so close to the dam and a power struggle ensues between the apes and man. The apes blame humans for the history of experiments and captivity they endured, and the humans blame the apes for the virus that wiped out most of mankind. There is also a power struggle going on amongst the apes themselves too, as Caesar still has some compassion for man and doesn't wish for any further confrontation between apes and man, but realises the relationship between species will always be strained. Yet one chimp, named Koba, has let his hatred of humans fester and grow and sees them strictly as the enemy, and although he respects Caesar as his leader, he begins to distrust Caesar's feelings for humans. This movie is outstanding. Director Matt Reeves certainly delivers. 'Dawn Of' looks amazing right from the opening scene, the action is plentiful, there are some incredibly powerful scenes with some genuinely emotional moments too, but it has to be said, it is the power struggle between the apes themselves that is the film's most fascinating element. The special effects are fantastic. The motion capture work with the apes is truly impressive. Andy Serkis is back as Caesar, and his performance in 'Rise Of' was incredible but in this, he just gets better and better. He really is the heart and soul of these movies. I can't understand how this man has not been given an Oscar for his performance capture work. Jason Clarke plays Malcolm, who forms a bond with Caesar. He is a good actor and his performance is very natural, at times it honestly looks like he isn't acting. Gary Oldman is also in this movie, and as in every film he has been in he is just superb. His role as Dreyfus, is almost the human equivalent of Caesar. He is the leader of the surviving humans and will do anything to protect his community, just like Caesar with the apes. As much as this movie is visually spectacular, the direction, the cinematography, the music, and the performances, there is such a fascinating, emotional core to this film where you get really involved and attached to the apes. 'Dawn of.' improves in every way from its predecessor. Everything about this movie is better than 'Rise Of', and as Matt Reeves has directed the upcoming 'War For The Planet Of The Apes', I am very excited for its release. This is a superb film. Make sure you add both 'Rise Of' and 'Dawn Of' to your DVD collection."
" I have a very distinct opinion about this movie.
",0.0,-0.9916,2017-07-07 00:00:00,4,"So in anticipation of the next Planet of the apes movie, War for the Planet of the Apes, which I am extremely excited for but not for the same reason as everyone else, I have decided to review one of few films which I have a very distinct opinion on. First of all I admire the original 1968 Planet of the Apes very much and one of the reasons one of the reasons I went to see this movie was because people have claimed it to be better than the original. Unfortunately with all the praise this movie was getting it was disappointing to find that this movie was not good.I am the only person so far that doesn't like this movie. I don't know anyone who didn't like this movie. I will state my reasons for not liking this movie.The first thing I have to start with is the characters with the exception of the protagonist Caesar. I am guessing you are wondering why I am excluding Caesar from the negative aspects of the film but I will get to that later. Anyway, I think most of the characters in the film are either dull or clichéd. I will give some examples and you will understand(or not). One example is the antagonists. The character Koba in my opinion was a very clichéd villain and so was Gary Oldman's. How were they clichéd? Well, the problem is that the villain just hates and has really no other interesting motivation. Another example is some of the human characters which were just dull and that is all I can really say because there isn't much to them. The second problem I have with this movie is the plot. There isn't much to say about the plot because again like most of this movie there isn't much to it and it also feels very familiar. The other problem with the plot is that it doesn't ever seem to try to grab the viewer's attention. And the final problem with the plot was the horrific climax. The problem with the climax is that first its a complete shift in tone, second it is poorly executed and over the top in the worst way and third it is completely lacking in suspense. I think that now there isn't much left to complain about therefore I will resort to slightly complaining about the visuals. I think that the visuals are definitely something that the movie did right but at the climax they were the complete opposite. Even though I may not like this movie it does have one if not two redeeming qualities. One is of course Andy Serkis's Oscar worthy performance. The other redeeming quality is Andy Serkis's character, Caesar. I felt that Caesar was an interesting protagonist with well realized struggles that Andy Serkis helped portray. Overall Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a dull, clichéd, poorly written movie, even though it has an interesting protagonist and a phenomenal performance from Andy Serkis and that is why it gets a 2/4. I hope the next movie improves on this."
" Not impressed
",-0.3724,-0.5229,2017-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Good movie. I can not point at any faults in it. And again, it did not leave me impressed. It lacks that special charm old versions had. Even Barton's version had it. For some reason, it did not pull me into the story. As an outside observer, I have to acknowledge its greatness in all technical aspects, but the story itself left me indifferent. I wasn't moved by emotional scenes, didn't feel the tension of drama or adrenaline rush of action scenes. I watch and see it's all at a very high level, but I do not feel anything at all. It may be up to me, but I consider this to be one of weaker Planet of the Apes movies. The only one below this one was the movie from 1973.7/10"
" Ape not kill Ape. Reeves Not Kill Franchise!
",0.8302,0.9989,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"'DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' was directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke and Toby Kebbell. Over a decade after the simian flu wiped out most of the worlds humans, Caesar(Andy Serkis) and his band of apes have grown immensely and become much more intelligent. Meanwhile, Malcom(Jason Clarke) and a band of human survivors ask Caesar for help to help humans survive. This creates a rift between both the apes, the humans and the relationships between both. ​ Very few sequels improve upon the stepping stones left behind by their predecessor. Only rare occasions like with 'The Dark Knight', 'Terminator 2' and 'Fast Five' do we get sequels that are infinitely better than their already brilliant originals. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is one of these uncommon occasions. Sure it has its flaws(some of which do carry over from 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes') but it also fixes many and doubles the amount of drama and action that was there before. Pretty much everything is either improved or stays the same when compared to its predecessor. Nothing retraces its steps quality wise and that is very pleasing in today's movie climate.For example, the story in the original was very well written and I congratulated the writers for that. Building of the success of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', they could have just slapped a story together to string the events along but they don't and I genuinely admire that. They still put effort into the story and give it meaning and impact. The themes of betrayal and being a father carry over to here which was nice but I would have liked to see something new and different. The ending here, which I won't spoil, is also really good and perfectly sets up 'War For the Planet of the Apes'. Overall, they could have just made a weak story and ending just to hurry up the action but they don't and they genuinely try to deliver a pleasing narrative.Next, there is the acting. I've said it once, I'll say it again, Andy Serkis deserved some love from the Oscars for his mesmerising portrayal as Caesar and I honestly feel its disrespectful they haven't given him one yet. Toby Kebbell was also great as Koba and he has a clear arc from point A - B. All the non-human characters in the film were excellently acted and wrote and were the standouts of the film. That said, most of the human characters were very weak and their acting wasn't too special either. Jason Clarke, for starters, was very weak as Malcolm and showed no joy, sadness or anger at any point in the film. I feel like Gary Oldman at least tried as Dreyfus but that was no match for how poorly written the humans were. I will say that's the main flaw of most of the humans. Most of them were competently acted and whatnot but none of them had any interesting motives or personalities and were all forgettable. None of them were particularly likable and they were all replaceable, both as characters and actors. That said, both the villains were alright and, although one of them had a pretty weak arc for me, both of them were pretty threatening.Technically, this movie is flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the visual effects and mind blowing and even the costume/set design was brilliant. Matt Reeves is proving he's a world class director on a technical level and I am always amazed with the visually stunning work he pushes out.Now for the action... It's absolutely awesome! I thought it would be pretty hard to top the action in its predecessor but I was very wrong. I won't go into detail, because you really should see it for yourself, but I must describe ONE tiny segment of action that will have to make you see it. An ape... riding a horse... carrying an assault rifle... while jumping through flames. If that doesn't get you interested in this movie then I don't know what will. Aside from the action, this movie is also pretty damn spectacular on an emotional and dramatic level. This movie pulled at my heartstrings multiple times and must be commended for that. Colour me impressed. One thing I will say was pretty flawed about the movie was some of the dialogue which was unbelievably cliché and could be predicted from a mile away. I must of said what a character was gonna say before they said it like 20 or 30 times in the movie because it was pretty damn cliché.In Conclusion, this movie is dramatic, emotion, action packed, a visual treat and is well worth your time and money. 8/10"
" War has already begun...
",-0.5994,0.9954,2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"The 2014 ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" was actually a rather impressive addition to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, and it was a very entertaining movie.Writers Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Rick Jaffa and Pierre Boulle did a good job in constructing a well-rounded storyline with interesting characters and lots of action.There is a nice continuation to the story, picking up from the 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". Which puts the two movies together quite nicely, especially if you watch these back to back.The storyline in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is good, and it picks up a good pace right from the very beginning, and it continues on in this pace all throughout the entire movie, which leaves for a very entertaining movie experience.Furthermore, the characters in the movie, both man and ape, were well-rounded and detailed, having distinctive personalities, traits and characteristics.And they had a great ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. I did really enjoy Gary Oldman in his role in this movie, as it felt like the role was custom-written specifically for him. Andy Serkis did a great job with his performance as Caesar. But it was generally a nice thing to see a relatively unfamiliar ensemble of cast for a movie such as this.The special and practical effects in the movie was quite good, and it really worked out quite well because it was so realistic to look at. And having good special effects is a definite must for a movie of this kind.There is a good amount of action in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" as well, combined with an interesting story.My rating of this movie is a very solid 7 out of 10 stars."
" The promised sequel.
",0.3612,0.9023,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"""Planet of the Apes: Revolt"" is the promised sequel to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", both of which are based on Pierre Boulle's dystopic book. Now humans are a minority, a race facing extinction (what an irony!) that apes seem to be able to seriously threaten. The contact between them reminded me of the difficult and dangerous understanding between different communities when distrust prevails. We can imagine something similar in moments of our past, like the first contact between European navigators and indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Distrust, fear, displays of power to intimidation... the film shows these in a very interesting way, with the apes being very similar to us, in behavior and way of think. Unfortunately, the whole film is quite pretentious and full of self-importance: both sides have an exaggerated awareness of the relevance of events to their own community. This is the most boring point of the movie. The actors do a good job, but non-human characters get more interest and dominate the scene. Technically, the film doesn't deserve major criticism. CGI is more cautious than in the first movie and seems more real. Sequences of combat and action are breathtaking, certainly pleasing to those who seek action and adventure."
" Dreary and ponderous
",-0.34,0.9772,2017-04-17 00:00:00,4,"Based on some reviews, I went into this expecting a big action blockbuster. But based on the first hour, which is all I could take, this is more of a dreary morality play about the white man and the noble savage. In this case, the noble savage is simian and the white man is not entirely white or man, but that's still the feel. The few remaining humans after an apocalypse encounter a tribe of flourishing super-apes. Some believe in co-existence, some not so much. The movie is very much of a mind that noble people who want to work together will be undercut by jerks. In order to make this happen, the movie even creates an unconvincing reason for the head noble human to drag along a virulent anti-aper along with him into the jungle. It's the sort of predictable situation this movie seems inordinately fond of.The CGI is pretty good. The apes aren't quite real, but the scenes where masses of them would coalesce are pretty impressive. But outside of that this is pure tedium."
" Once Again, Apes Outshine Humans
",0.0,-0.8095,2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"When this franchise was re-booted a couple of years ago, I had high hopes for it. Though ""Rise"" was a middling movie by almost any description, it provided just enough ""canon"" moments for ""Ape-heads"" like myself to have hope for the future. A future in which an ape invasion of humans could be rendered visually believable, which is what ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" portends to do. On a strictly technically basis, it comes through with flying colors. One can indeed see a believable interpretation of a human/ape war. The problem? It tells such a boring story along the way.For a basic plot summary, ""Dawn"" picks up a number of years after ""Rise"" ends. In the future, humans are decimated by a simian flu (thank you, Big Pharmacy!) and down to pockets of existence. When the San Francisco band of humans (led by Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman) ventures into the redwood forests to power up a hydroelectric dam, they stumble upon a community of apes led by Caesar (Andy Serkis), who has the advanced power of speech as previous developed. Tensions run high between human and ape, with one wrong move threatening to start an all-out war.In the ""old school"" ape films, there is most definitely a ""buy-in"" level, as the ""apes"" are clearly actors in monkey suits. While likely not a problem for sci-fi buffs (like myself), others may not have the imagination for such a ""reach"". With today's movie technology, however, an ape rebellion looks very, very real, with apes swinging through trees and learning new skills as they evolve. No long does one have to imagine the apes taking over planet Earth...you can watch it happen!Sadly, there is NOTHING else interesting going on in this film. You thought James Franco's character was a bit wooden in the first one? ""Dawn"" is oh so much worse. Not a single human character is even remotely interesting, and the plot is about as bland as one can get away with in such a high-profile release. Never once did I feel as if I truly cared about anything that was transpiring up on the screen (aside from a few of the ""ape action"" scenes, of course).Let me put it to you this way: In the film ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", Caesar the talking ape rallies his simian friends to begin a chaotic riot in the first steps towards breaking their human bondage. At the end of that tension-filled riot, Roddy McDowell (Caesar) gives an epic, hair-raising speech proclaiming ""tonight begins the planet of the apes!"". There is not one second of ""Dawn"" that even approaches that sort of high drama. Instead, it is a palate of great special effects tagged with a lousy script/characters. I was really excited about the potential of this new ""Apes"" franchise going in, but this clunker has significantly dulled that enthusiasm."
" Too worthy for its own good
",0.7003,0.9458,2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the latest in the long-running franchise, following on from the reboot RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. This one was directed by CLOVERFIELD's Matt Reeves and features a mostly different cast to the first, albeit retaining Andy Serkis as the chief chimp Caesar. This time around the action is on a much larger scale, depicting a constant running state of warfare between surviving humanity and the organised primates.It's a very different beast to the first movie, set in a post-apocalyptic world enhanced by CGI effects. And the CGI is the main thing you'll take away from this film, which features some truly fantastic work; the motion capture in particular is quite brilliant and the main apes are the best I've ever seen. They've come a long way from Gollum all those years back. Even the eyes are beginning to look realistic, which is saying something.The rest of the story is a mixed bag. There are some good actors in the mix, including Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman, but the whole thing feels a bit too messy, a bit too grand and overwhelmed in CGI spectacle at the expense of depth. Me, I'm not too keen on CGI action scenes and these are typical for the format: explosive, fast-paced, and never involving. The script isn't as good as it should be, and the overlong running time gives the whole movie a sluggish feel at times. What you're left with is a comic book-style movie about humanised apes which is far too serious and would-be worthy for its own good."
" The Best In The Planet Of The Apes Movies
",0.6369,-0.9576,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"10 years after the end of ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes,"" Simian Flu has killed 99.8% of the humans, putting people in a new Dark Age. As the humans struggle to survive, apes, under the leadership of Caesar (played by Andy Serkis), thrive in the new world order. It is the ""Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes."" It is remarkable to see what the apes have created in 10 years: a home within a forest; a school that teaches young apes sign language; Caesar having the ability to speak; and a set of laws that apes have given themselves, such as ""ape not kill ape.""For a decade, Serkis and his group of hundreds of evolving apes haven't had contact with humans, assuming all people have died. This assumption is quickly proved wrong when two apes run into a small group of humans, resulting in an injury to an ape and fueling more distrust between the two species. But a human, played by Jason Clarke, makes a plea to Serkis to allow the humans to work in ape territory so that the humans can get back electric power and have some semblance of civilization back.After discussing the delicate situation with his inner circle of apes, Serkis decides to help the humans instead of making war with them. Serkis not only hopes of a peaceful future with the humans, he's also aware that the humans still have guns; and war with the humans can mean total destruction for the apes. Unfortunately, his right-hand-ape, Koba, is not of the same mindset; and Koba's hatred for all humans will make him do whatever it takes to destroy the fragile peace so that an all out war against the human survivors will be triggered.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes"" is the scene immediately before Koba leads an attack against the human city. The humans, alerted to the impending assault, have manned their towers and gates, heavily armed with automatic rifles, machine-guns, and grenade launchers. They wait and stare at the open road that leads to their city. It is quiet, but it is only the calm before the storm. Beyond where the humans' lights can reach, the sounds of hundreds of apes screaming slowly becomes audible.I have seen every ""Planet Of The Apes"" movie, and this is the best of them. From the beginning, I was amazed. Yes, ""Dawn"" doesn't have the ""holy s*#t"" surprise ending of the first movie (the 1968 version, not the reboot), but it does rival the first movie's social commentaries; and of course, it crushes the first movie when it comes to action and special effects.One final thought: watch and listen carefully during the scene when the apes were discussing what they should do with the newly discovered humans. I immediately thought that this probably played out hundreds of years ago when Native Americans were discussing what to do with the newly discovered white settlers on their lands.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
