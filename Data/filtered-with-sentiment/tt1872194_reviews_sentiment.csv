" A Gift to Watch
",0.4404,0.9806,2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie. The 4 lead men gave powerful and memorable performances. I have been thinking about the movie for 2 days - so impressed by these amazing actors. It's dark and it's intense. I love the performance of Jeremy Strong as Dale. A moving and beautiful film. One of my favourites.
" Vera's the best!
",0.6696,-0.1326,2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, but Vera Famiga's persona stands out at being nothing short of stunning! In the right film, with the right role, she's untouchable."
" Absolutely brilliant filmmaking
",0.624,0.7841,2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,A heartwarming and deeply emotional experience. Above all a moving father and son story. Duvall and Downey deliver incredible Oscar worthy performances. A long film yet I found it incredibly gripping.
" A difficult father-son relationship story well told
",-0.1027,0.9186,2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't initially sold on the idea of this film but found it surprisingly captivating. As usual, Downey Jr plays the hard-to-like, arrogant, intelligent guy. In this case, he's a hot-shot city lawyer who returns to his tiny hometown to defend his judge father (Duvall) who is accused of murder.While the plot is centred around the murder trial, it's really about the troubled relationship between father and son (with the the court case and Duvall's making it hard for Downey Jr to defend him forming a parallel with the ""I want to love you but you make it hard for me to do so"" concept).The family dynamic here makes for interesting viewing, with a cast of heavily flawed characters who are not particularly likeable but are certainly believable.With the exploration of several relationships, it is slow-paced and packs in a lot but I didn't find it overly long. It's also beautifully shot, which helps to capture some poignant moments."
" Solid courtroom / Family drama.
",0.1531,0.9746,2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"This is a really well written drama, with some great dialogue and despite it's length is well paced and keeps the attention. I also found it to be very moving and a realistic portrait of a dysfunctional families dynamics. It's an adult film with very grown up themes, but also has moments of great humour and pathos. An unexpectedly intelligent treat, which is so rare these days."
" Good...
",0.0,0.8552,2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Robert was born for these sexist and self-destructive sexist roles, they fall like gloves, and I have a crush on seeing them go bad and fall out of their own arrogance, here we have a beaten and démodé drama, but as an elegant and modern outfit, which makes it very attractive, and with good doses of friction, discussions, and some emotion..."
" GUILTY!!
",-0.5242,0.0258,2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,"Of wasting my time with a multitude of unnecessary subplots, get to the point already.. I got to the point I couldn't remember if I cared.Wasted opportunity"
" Dramatic and moving
",0.0,0.8221,2020-12-19 00:00:00,9,"A court drama movie with a good plot and good acting, I highly recommend it."
" An opportunity to witness fine acting
",0.5574,0.9643,2020-12-19 00:00:00,7,"The Judge, if anything, is a movie where the true capabilities of Robert Downey Jr. And Robert Duvall truly show. A long time estranged relationship between father and son is the central theme of the movie. Along this 2 hour 20 minute movie, you see the highs and the lows of everything about family. From death to divorce, it really touches base on the very core of family.The movie does a great job of keeping your attention, however it is definitely on the longish side and could do with some judicious pruning. A fine attempt by the director, however it could be a little tighter.A great watch, especially if you're someone who's patient and can actually appreciate slow movies where you can revel in the beautiful craft of acting by two top notch actors"
" nothing better
",-0.3412,0.9287,2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,"I don't know what is Robert Downey, Jr's fav from his own works but out out all the movies he has done this is the best one. Every successful kid should watch this movie and see how our ego destroyed long standing relationship with our parents. Full 10 marks to David for the direction and full marks to Robert Downey.
I am a movie buff and this one of my fav movie independent of genres"
" Incredible film, very touching
",0.0,0.5994,2020-12-16 00:00:00,10,Loved the script and acting. Very touching film that says a lot more than law.
" A schmaltzy mess with some geniunely effective moments
",0.1531,0.9319,2020-12-12 00:00:00,5,"It's a mishmash of a fine story, subpar writing, good performances and messy directing. It's too long and Vera Farmiga's entire subplot should've been cut.For every really good scene (and there's a lot of really good scenes), there's a scene that makes me go ""no, I do not like that"".It's a mixed bag, though a rewarding one. It's very flawed, but in the end, I did enjoy it and I do reccomend it, because it's not terrible, it just never quite stops feeling like a corny and schmaltzy, though still somewhat effective melodrama.Watch it and judge (hehe) for yourself."
" Watch it to Judge yourself
",0.0,-0.2732,2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"The Judge is takes you into deeper self of you and your loved ones.I feel many of us can relate to the misses one has with the protagonist. The emotions and the way things unfold in the movie are predictable but worth giving a watch, the father son relationship is the core of the movie when both are in need of eachother and how they come closer with the father being on murder trail."
" Don't be THE JUDGE and the avoid it!
",-0.3595,0.3738,2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"The Judge is not a courtroom thriller. It is a well performed touching portrayal of a tarnished father-son relationship over the course of a murder trial. Although, the storyline is thoroughly clichéd, moving lead performances, engaging screenplay and fitting background score make it a really good and emotional watch."
" Amazing Movie - A must watch for every lawyer
",0.5859,0.4215,2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,I have recently watched this movie on Netflix and liked every bit of it. Its a must watch of every lawyer.
" One of the best family drama movie
",0.6369,0.9262,2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"The title of the movie could mislead people because it's more than a crime and courtroom movie it's more deep than these, full of emotions and at the end of the movie you start to think about the value of the family as movie successfully dig deep about it
Amazing acting with wonderful directing and most beautiful filming locations and sights."
" Patchy
",0.0,-0.8884,2020-11-22 00:00:00,4,"A good performance by Duvall, but whilst Downey Jr was good in the various relationship roles he did not convince as an attorney and for me this undermined the film.The scenes with the weak and and inexperienced lawyer did not sit well in this film. This was no fault of the actor it was just silly plot. It worked in the excellent ""My Cousin Vinnie"" but was all wrong here.Overall there are too many story lines going on, many of them sketchy and bitty so not adding anything substantive to the film."
" A complete film
",0.0,0.9272,2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"This film had a little bit of everything- comedy, drama, mystery and a bit of sadness interwoven. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent, as was the whole cast. Just seeing this for the first time nearly 7 years since it was released and was very impressed. This is classic Downey Jr. acting infused with some great comedy. Check this one out!"
" Excellent must see movie!!
",0.6467,0.9817,2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie rates a 15+!!!
Excellence to a core!! Downey once again brought greatness as an actor and did such superb acting out of this character!! Duvall makes you want to believe in law and order to a judges -T!! And rough relationships with fathers!
And the brothers were actors of equivalent!! I loved the plot!! The excellence in all the actors/actresses superb!! The choice of cast was spot on!! A watch again kind of movie!
One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!"
" Very solid film
",0.2247,0.8662,2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"The film is very solid not much things you can find wrong with it. RDJ was amazing as you'd expect, played the role of cocky perfectly. It was Abit long but that's about it, I very much enjoyed it."
" Superb
",0.6249,0.9699,2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I hardly rate 8 or 9 but this movie is solid 10. Star studded movie. Great direction, great writing, and great acting! Downey Jr, Duvall, Farmiga, and Thornton are just impeccable! I can watch over and over again."
" Well acted, good story, a little too long.
",0.6124,0.9349,2020-10-24 00:00:00,6,"I much prefer films that have a credible and interesting story and this is such a film. The acting is excellent with both lead actors in top form. For me, the one downside and why I only gave it a 6 was I felt the film was 30 minutes too long. I like films to unfold, but it just seems to drag at times. Cut some scenes and this would certainly be a much better film in my opinion and I would have given it at least an 8. Still worth watching for a decent story and excellent acting."
" BRILLIANT !!
",0.7284,0.9458,2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Just so we're clear - I've never given a 10 rating EVER. If there was provision to go higher I would.Superb performances by Downey and Duval, brilliant script with lots and lots of layers aided also by teriffic performances from the entire cast.I can't heap enough superlatives at this movie.
It took me on a joyous ride -- moving me, entertaining me, elating me, delighting me.WATCH IT."
" Court room family drama
",0.0,0.296,2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,Highly gripping from start to finish. Tears at your heart as you see the crippling effects of cancer on the Judge.Robert Downey Jr. is perfect in this role as the Defense council.Soft ending which I appreciated immensely.
" Good film
",0.4404,0.5859,2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,A well written film and well acted by all with all.the emotional content needed
" Great acting...ok movie
",0.6249,0.8555,2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes you can just enjoy great acting, and to see Duvall and Downey Jr together USA treat. Both are wonderful actors, and together they are great. But the film strays into melodrama to facilitate the acting, and that shouldn't happen."
" Excellent film
",0.5719,0.7096,2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"Great film with fine performances from all involved. Especially the 2 Roberts.
I'll never tire of watching this film.
Each to their own."
" Judgment days
",0.0,-0.9509,2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,"A high power lawyer Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr) returns to his childhood home to attend his mother's funeral. Upon his return, there is a palpable strained relationship between him and his dad, Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall). He also is reunited with his brothers Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio) a failed athlete& Dale (Jeremy Strong) who has autism & old flame Samantha Powell (Vera Farmiga) .Hank is desperate to leave ASAP but a turn of event occurs involving his dad scuppers said plan. His dad is accused of the murder of a person that he sentenced to prison & is recently released back to public.The characterisation of this dysfunctional family is very believable especially between Hank and Joseph Palmer. It is a gripping story whereby Hank is trying to save his dad from being found guilty of 1st degree murder and also concurrently he tried to mend bridges between them. So in a way he is fighting on 2 fronts and it is entertaining to watch. The humour is organic and it makes you sit at the edge of the seat until the ending.It is decent enough film but pales in comparison to classic court room films such as A Few Good Men, Philadelphia, etc. The ending is predictable and pulls on your emotional strings just at the right time and place."
" Movie with potential but something is missing
",-0.4215,0.7906,2020-09-06 00:00:00,6,"Watched recently. Love RDJ , role made for him. The judge himself also great acting. However it seemed bit forced and overdone.the last court scene a bit dramatic but ceased to impress."
" Outstanding
",0.6124,0.9948,2020-08-31 00:00:00,9,"Watch this if only to see outstanding performances from RDJ and Robert Duvall, but to be honest, that's a disservice to all the amazing supporting cast - Jeremy Strong to highlight just one! A beautiful story wonderfully told by great actors, under masterful direction. I gave it a 9/10 because in a couple of places the pace did dip, but it didn't affect how great this movie is. Totally worth watching!"
" Worthless tripe
",-0.4404,-0.3381,2020-08-27 00:00:00,3,"I can't believe I keep falling for these homely tales of waspies in trouble... or rather floundering at coping with life much like the quality actors in this dodgy mess were with their scripts.
It began well enough ish then muddled along a bit, got horribly maudlin and confused as if they could not choose the outcome. Maybe they should not have bothered, I wish I hadn't. Thanks Netflix for saving me a tenner on a cinema ticket...
That is three loads of codswollop this week, The Meg, The Judge and The Predator.... Indefinite articles the lot of them.... save your money go knit a hat or ride a bike, anything but watch these three WoTs."
" Father-Son relationship at best
",0.6369,0.5915,2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"This movie describe a complicated father-son relationship so well. Go watch it and you'll definitely got it. And oh, the genre is crime so it'll make you understand some law here and there. Good movie overall."
" The lead is SO irritating.
",-0.6157,-0.8068,2020-08-25 00:00:00,4,"This is watchable but that's about it. No surprises and typical US drama, but Robert Jr, he's almost unwatchable as is SO arrogant. I think that's just him in real life and he can't tone it down when acting. He just look in the mirror and lick himself. Spoilt the film really."
" Gentle and heartwarming
",0.7184,0.9782,2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Super film that will have you gripped, not because of the court room scenes which take a side story to the main purpose of this film, but seeing a family struggle and come together when needed. The acting is excellent, not just from the principles, but also to the strong supporting cast..... The bath scene is moving and a pivotal part in a complex relationship.Yes there's similarities to other movies, yes there's plot holes and more questions then you may heard asked, you may guess the plot early, but watch it play out and challenge yourself not to be moved by the well paced, well acted movie."
" Engrossing, well acted, vey entertaining
",0.6124,0.997,2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall give powerhouse performances in this tale of a lawyer revisiting his home town, and all of the issues that come with opening up old relationships, good and badHank Palmer (Downey Jr) is a Chicago defence attorney, who is called back to his home town to attend his mothers' funeral. It is clear that this not a town with happy memories, which is hinted at through his intitial interactions with his 2 brothers, played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong. His relationship with his father, the titular Judge (Duvall), is non existent, with the two barely on speaking terms.With Hank leaving, he finds that his father has been accused of murder, and this leads to the ""Big Lawyer Small Town"" scenario, where Hank tried to push against this community who are stuck in their ways, in order to prove his father's innocence, whilst reconnecting with an old flame and trying to maintain a father daughter connection too.Downey Jr has done so well out of the wise cracking Tony Stark that it has actually bled into other performances, and this is no exception. But his ability to switch between the glib remarks and genuine emotion is what makes this movie so engrossing, with some moments of levity (including a very non-typical shower scene that provides a funny moment combined with genuine love and emotion).Duvall is his reliable best, playing a proud man who is more concerned about his reputation as a judge in this small town than building up his relationship with his estranged son.A very strong supporting cast including Billy Bob Thornton and Vera Farmiga, and a very funny turn from Dax Shepherd as an antique shop owner come defence attorney, make this film seem shorter than its actual running time without feeling rushedAll in all, i really enjoyed this film. I was highly engrossed in all the performances and both the highs and lows the characters experience. It provides a great balance, providing some genuinely emotional moments, interspersed with some funny instances as well. Would definitely recommend this"
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9252,2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Really great film with a sad feel to it across the whole film, which is not a bad thing and gets you really into the film and the characters and what's happening in their lives. Great performances all round and I do love court room scenes which some of this film is based in."
" Feel good perfectly acted

" This film moved me. I cried like a baby.

Yes it's cliched, yes you've probably watched a film like this before but it's like an old pair of shoes, instant classic, hits all the right notes and for my mind, for all the right reasons. If you have a heart and I know that you do, you'll love this film."
" 2020 Review: An emotional movie with powerful acting by both Downey and Duvall
",0.5267,0.8301,2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"I was browsing through Netflix and happened to stumble upon this movie.
I dont usually watch Drama movies but for the sake of Downey I watched it and oh boy! What an amazing film.Sure it gets dragged around a little bit but the focus and plot of the movie doesn't deviate. The acting by both actors is really really good. They played their characters amazingly. The anger, the frustration, the cursing all very realistic.I was watching this movie with a pal who had lost his dad less than a month ago. The ending made him weep and in turn me too. We both are 30 year old guys staying away from our families. One of the most best movies I have watched.
Definitely recommended."
" 10/10 4 not being a superhero movie
",0.0,0.9786,2020-08-06 00:00:00,7,It's a pleasant movie and those who've grown up in narcissistic families will be able to relate.Unfortunately in real life such happy endings are rare if not non-existent. Narcissists don't really see the errors in their ways or change.The trailer made this look like some epic court battle was going to take place but this never really happened. Billy Bob Thornton would have made a worthy opponent but he was underused.Downey Jr and Duvall were excellent and it was a pleasant movie. The best parts being the dynamics between the family members.It gets 10/10 just for not being a superhero movie.
" Simply beautiful
",0.5994,0.815,2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"A very good film to watch.. long but worth it.. legal drama, comedy, plus plus"
" Fathers and sons
",0.0,0.9792,2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"When it comes to family relationships, cinema always has something to say. David Dobkin's dramatic work also has something to say, although not necessarily new.
The story is about a small town judge, who is charged with murder on the same day that his wife passes away. Against this background, his children, especially his son Henry, will have to do everything possible to defend him.
It is as well as this history is outlined like a judicial one, but that really comes to be a familiar story. A powerful family drama that covers different edges, perhaps too many and many do not end up fitting into the story. However, the truly important relationship ends up being that of the judge with her son. A story is drawn where the relationship of both is the support of the story, beyond the judgment itself. And this support is also helped by the great performances of Duvall and Downey Jr., two Roberts who give this film an authentic emotionality.
'The Judge' is a story of family relationships, of a slow but effective narration. Although it is sometimes a bit cliché, this can be left out due to the emotionality it contains."
" Professional Critics are not always right!
",-0.3595,0.9777,2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I was quite astounded/disappointed to find that the general consensus among professional media critics for this film, to be rather less than average (48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes)Yes, this family drama does have its fair share of cliched scenes that have been done to death elsewhere. Which is all very well if you've seen those films. But if you haven't, or simply don't care for such snobbery, then this film is still far more worthy and compelling, not least for the outstanding acting performances from Duvall and Downey Jr.I guess it would have been nice to have learned more about the breakdown between Hank (Downey Jr) and his wife leading to a divorce. All we get is about 3 or 4 minutes with them arguing at the beginning of the film, and then we never see his wife again!Similarly Hank's brief flirtation with Carla (the daughter of Hank's ex girlfriend). We see her in a couple of tangible scenes, but then she too is dropped, never to be seen of again.But those are very minor points. What was hugely enjoyable was Hank's difficulty with adjusting to his family's way of life in small-town America. And in particular his fractured relationship with his dad (Duvall) and two brothers.The courtroom drama with Hank defending his own father (a well-respected former judge in the town), against charges of murder and manslaughter after an RTA, were well done, but very much secondary to the story as a whole.The final scenes were predictable, but nicely done for all that. And the moments in the empty courtroom with Hank spinning the chair belonging to his father is compelling, not least for the excellent song from Bon Iver, called Holocene. The lyrics of which infer that the world does not revolve around you and your ego!Which is a good metaphor for Hank, who considers himself a big-shot lawyer, with an ego to match where he lives in Chicago. But being such a big place you're still fairly anonymous. Whereas returning to his home town, along with building a few bridges, could well mean he make a big and positive difference not just for himself but for those around him."
" Great acting. Basic story line is good.
",0.7906,0.9801,2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Watching the movie six years after its release. The acting was top notch among the main characters. Glad to see Robert Downey Jr. put up a great performance as the Marvel Universe seems to have wasted his talent. Robert Duvall is also excellent - reminds me of his Tender Mercy performance.My only complaint is the excess plot of new old love interest. Writer could have explore more about Downey's failing marriage and perhaps links it to the father / son relationship. Adding that element really interrupt the flow of the movie.Great acting performances need to be treasured with great story line as they are few and far between in the recent movie making. As I enjoy trilogy action movies once in the while, industry needs to balance it more with this type of movies."
" A few good scenes with a lot of crap piled on top
",0.2732,-0.8466,2020-05-17 00:00:00,4,"Two great actors wasted with a crappy script and a terrible director.A lack of attention to details will always ruin a movie and this one has it in spades. I don't believe that using deus ex machina in any movie is valid and I also dislike continuity errors. All of them exist in this movie and it bleeds out because of them.The story is a good one, successful son who never got along with his father comes up because the mom he loved dies. He comes home to deal with the father and other issues, while having to deal with crap back home (via long distance).There is a lot of growth for the characters but there is too much getting in the way of the actors and the script. There is no breathing room for them to fully reach the pinnacle of the story. There is a lackluster ending which is disappointing."
" Great cast
",0.6249,0.5563,2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,And really good acting all the way through the movie. However the script is a bit boring and Running time definitely too long.
" Quality in every department, and hitting the mark
",0.0,0.949,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"I may be overvaluing The Judge today for I have seen so many half-baked movies lately. I try to pick flicks that get a good rating on IMDb (7+), an ok metascore (60+) and most of the time the result is a lame effort hardly worth an average episode from a good TV-series.Basically The Judge is a winner in all departments. I see some sneer at the basic setup of a made man going back to his childhood little town to confront his past. So what? It is a very fertile starting point if you bring in talent and work. It would not make him justice to say it delivers because this not just a formulaic movie done well, the factored talent give life to a little something extra that changes everything.Such an harmony is the hardest to attain, putting in line all the elements so that nothing feels out of place. Nobody expects to be lucky (?) enough to watch a masterpiece every other day, but most people would be delighted to go more often to the movies if they could expect that high standard of quality."
" Great

" An Impact-full Father-Son Relationship followed by Solid Performances by Downey Jr. & Duvall
",0.1531,0.867,2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,"A father-Son problematic relationship surrounded by legal drama where Henry Palmer a ruthless lawyer in Chicago played by Robert Downey Jr. and his father Joseph Palmer The Judge played by Robert Duvall and how circumstances brings them together again.
Despite of fair screenplay and direction all praises goes to Downey Jr. as he always impresses with hi wit and sarcastic one liners which you can clearly see in trailer also if you go through with that and Robert Duvall with his impressive performance as aged judge who is accused of some hit and run case.
Although film got mixed reviews from critiques one thing at which all had their consensus was the performances by the leads and that is why I am recommending this movie to watch"

",0.6249,0.9008,2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"I don't get it. Why so many negative reviews? Like seriously, it doesn't make sense. First off, that was the best acting I've seen in a while. Robert Duvall is definitely like top 4 greatest actors of all time imo. Tbh I wasn't expecting such a great performance from RDJ tho. Beautifully shot, scored and written. I can care less about 141 minutes as long as it has great performances, screenplay, cinematography, a good score and The Judge had it all. People just like to hate on stuff for no apparent reason."

",0.4404,0.9485,2019-11-11 00:00:00,8,"Really a sentimental melodrama more than hardcore courtroom fare, The Judge is overly long and has a subplot concerning Downey's character and an ex girlfriend that wastes screen time and adds nothing to the story.Nevertheless, Downey demonstrates why he is one of the best actors of his generation. Duvall, whose legacy has long been established, doesn't coast on his reputation. He plays his character to the max.Good supporting performances by Vincent Donofrio, Billy Bob Thornton, and Dax Shepard.Movies like this that lack fast action and are not greatly suspenseful depend on our ability to identify with the characters. That requires a good script and good actors. The script is somewhat cumbersome, with overly long scenes and the aforementioned irrelevant sub plot. But the two star performers are top notch. Definitely worth a watch."

" Solid Courtroom Drama - The Judge
",0.1531,0.9925,2019-10-12 00:00:00,7,"Initially, I did not think much of Robert Downey as an actor; I thought he was just another hip, pretty face, of which there were plenty in Hollywood. But as time passed, he made a greater and greater impression on me as a fine actor; especially in Chaplin, for which I thought he deserved the Academy Award. Since then, he has maintained a very high level of performance. This film features a strong all-star cast including a nice, understated performance by Billy Bob Thornton, and another fine performance from veteran, Robert Duval. Vincent Donofrio is always very good as well, but it appears he has been packing away those doughnuts he used to try and hide in Full Metal Jacket. The distaff members perform admirably, but this is mostly an actor's film. The script is tight and the production values are first-rate. Highly recommended."

" Thank you for making this film
",0.3612,0.0446,2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"I rarely ever contribute to IMDB. But this particular movie has compelled me to take out the time and pen together a review. Its screenplay, its storyline and most importantly its performances are par excellence. I particularly enjoyed watching Robert Downey Jr - a truly gifted actor whose talents are being grossly under utilized.The father - son duo (played by Robert Duvall and Downey Jr) are at ideological odds. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the father blames his son (Downey Jr) for a mishap that destroys the career prospects of the older son (D'onofrio). Their relationship is messy and the excessively harsh, grating taunts of the father does not help make things any better. The caustic words continue to do its damage but the overwhelming bond between father and son remains unshakeable. And it is this bond that keeps compelling them to continuously try to bridge the gulf between them.I resonated with this movie because of my own conflicted relationship with my father. How Hank feels about his father is very similar to my own feelings about my dad. Watching Downey Jr's character Hank struggle to put past events behind, to try desperately to put together his relationship with his father and fail over and over again, to want desperately to not care and yet be unable to walk out, to overcome the simultaneous bitterness and love that he feels towards his father provided a strong sense of catharsis to me. Its as if I can see my own emotions being portrayed by Downey Jr.Its tremendously heart warming - a must see if you too are burdened by unresolved issues with your parents, if you too have a hate-love relationship with them.The Judge is a story about real life characters dealing with real life issues. It provides a refreshing change from all those superhero movies that are being produced by the dozens. Really wish RDJ would consider making more of these. Do not give it a miss."
" You HAVE TO see this movie, guys.
",0.0,0.9793,2019-02-07 00:00:00,9,"The film was directed by David Dobkin, which is I've never watched any of his films BUT I liked this one. It stars Robert Duvall as Joseph Palmer(The Judge) and Robert Dawney JR. as his son, Hank Palmer. The film won three award in 2014 for the Icon Award (Robert Duvall), Supporting Actor of the Year(Robert Duvall) and the director won Truly Moving Picture Award. The film is set in the fictional town of Carlinville, Indiana. Scenes filmed in Pennsylvania and Worcester, Massachusetts.The film is about a father and a son. Hank Palmer is a succesful defense attorney in Chicago and he is getting divorce. His brother calls Hank to tell him their mom is dead. Hank goes to the Carnville, the place where he spent his childhood. He joined his mothers funeral. Hank ve The Judge's relationship is complicated, it seems like they don't like each other. After the funeral, Hank was on his way to Chicago, his brother called him and tell him that his father is accused with murder someone. So he is back for his father to defense him at the court. End of the movie, they lose the case, Joseph goes to prison for 7 seven months, then Hank find a way to get him out of prison. Joseph dies when they are on a boat and fishing.I strongly recommend The Judge. It has a strong drama and a crime movie, so if you love kind of movies, you should see it. There is also a very strong message : ""No matter what happens, family is everything and even though they have faults - like all people have - we should embrace them instead of keep distance beetwen them."""

" Dysfunction on trial has very little entertainment
",-0.0038,-0.9323,2019-01-11 00:00:00,4,"The idea for the main plot for ""The Judge"" had possibilities. But this film, with two stories intermixed, winds up a mess. One story is about Hank Palmer, a high-class lawyer from the big city, and his dysfunctional life. The other story is about his dad, Joseph Palmer, who has been a small town judge for most of his life and who is implicated in murder from a hit and run accident. The one thing that links these together is dysfunction - between Hank and his dad.Some minor small stories are intertwined here - in Hank's brothers Glen and Dale. The screenplay is terrible. It has just hints at the split between father and son, and holes leave one wondering more about the accident that ended Glen's baseball career.Hank Palmer is a jerk. He's a self-centered, egocentric, know-it-all attorney. He and his wife are getting a divorce, supposedly because she was unfaithful to him. But he was apparently never home. They have a young daughter, who appears in a couple of sequences. He can't forget, forgive or change himself. And that justifies his infidelity back in his hometown. But, that even involves incest, though Hank doesn't know it at the time.This is all background and filler for the big drama of the courtroom where the judge goes on trial for murder. But the family and Hank's dysfunctions take up much of the film.Robert Duvall received a couple of nominations for his role as Judge Joseph Palmer. Duvall is one of the best actors of the period. But, his late career portrayals are of similar eccentric or different characters. Robert Downey as Hank further solidifies a persona of a snappy character with matter-of-fact dialog and mannerisms. It works for an ""Iron Man"" image, but is a turn off in any serious roles, as here. Billy Bob Thornton's Dwight Dickham has a nice hair-do or toupee, but otherwise is forgettable.The best characters in this film are Hank's brothers, played by Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong. Vera Farmiga is good as Samantha Powell. There's just not much entertaining about this film."

" Half-Mast for a Half-Masterpiece.
",0.0,-0.6003,2018-09-22 00:00:00,6,"One of the three major elements that cripple The Judge, is its slow and awkwardly disjointed start. Robert Downey Jr. is too punchy for a story and script that requires a little bit of a more leisurely approach, and the director Dobkin seemed to struggle to make one scene fit seamlessly into the next; however this issue is way more evident at the beginning of the film.The second problem is, Robert Downey Jr. Though he was really fun to watch, I feel he needs to stay away from witty and charismatic roles for a while, because like it or not, all, or at the very least, the vast majority of what comes across is his alter ego, Tony Stark, and in this movie, a large portion of it felt like Tony Stark having issues with Howard Stark.The third problem is, The Judge tried to squeeze in too much drama, within a movie that somewhat jolted between genres. A dead mother, an accused father who's diagnosed with advanced cancer, a brother with shattered dreams, another with a mental condition and then Hank; estranged, angry, guilt ridden, pompous, divorcee in progress, damaged father, son, husband, brother, boyfriend and lawyer with something to prove and a heart full of pain, in a film that is a family drama turned court thriller back to romantic drama.However, with all of that said, The Judge really did have some amazing moments. The reason why Henry was named Henry. ""You got my bit 'o honey old man"" gesture. The spinning of the Judge's seat and of course, the real reason why Judge Palmer sent Hank to juvenile detention.The Judge is worth the watch, and if you're a Downey fan, then it's a definite must watch, however, the amazing parts in this film also further highlight how the rest of the movie dropped the ball, which is unfortunate really. 6/10."

As a negative aspect I would highlight the large number of cliches: a promising baseball player who ends his career for an injury, a man who does not visit his family in years ... In short, marvelous film that brings out the feelings of the viewer, so much paternal, as any feeling of spite or anger, a work that deserves to be seen"

" That's not my testimony.
",0.0,0.9366,2018-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is a cocky self-assured attorney who defends rich criminals and he is good at it, i.e. the Tony Stark character shines through. His father is a hard nosed judge in a small Indiana town. He hasn't been home in 20 years because of him. When his mother dies, Hank goes home and must face his father (Robert Duvall) and two brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio, Jeremy Strong). Family friction heats up, but when his father needs an attorney, Hank stays.At this point the past begins to unfold in ways neither we nor Hank expected. The film climaxes when his dad takes the witness stand in his own defense against the wishes of Hank. It is a story about family coming together.This was a remarkable drama, that is constantly developing. It has Oscar worthy performances by Duvall and Downey jr.

" Judgment Day
",0.0,-0.7452,2017-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Having grown up hating his father, an arrogant lawyer gradually finds it in his heart to defend his father, a respected judge, when he is accused of murder in this courtroom drama starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. The film made Oscar history when Duvall became the oldest Supporting Actor nominee for his role here, and he is every bit as good as that as he battles aggressive cancer and chemotherapy side effects while standing accused. Duvall has a particularly strong scene in which Downey helps him in the shower and the two of them bond over pretending (for the sake of Downey's daughter) that everything is fine with the old man. His stance that he would ""rather die in prison that be remembered as that"" resonates too. And yet, while there is much to like in how Downey and Duvall gradually patch up their differences, there is little escaping the fact that they are pretty obnoxious characters on their own (Downey intentionally urinates on another man's leg in the opening scene), which in turn makes the experience a little hard to sit through when it turns sappy and sentimental towards the end. The film is also bloated with a couple of subplots that could be trimmed (the old flame in particular), and yet, 'The Judge' is surprisingly riveting despite its massive length. Duvall is really that compelling and any music score by Thomas Newman always helps."
" Genuine, true-to-life family portrait with a side-dish of great courtroom drama
",0.6249,0.9801,2017-08-20 00:00:00,9,"Family relationships are often messy, confusing, and heartbreaking. This movie acknowledges that. Family relationships are also honest, tender, central to one's identity. This movie recognizes that, too.""The Judge"" is a mature movie that takes all the time it needs to establish its characters, their relationships with each other, and to show off their thought processes and evolution. It is in no hurry to enforce opinions on you, doesn't take the easy way out, and lets the viewer draw his own conclusions. The story follows a middle-aged man lawyer who is still struggling in his relationship with his authoritative father, because those are not issues that go away all of a sudden when you're a father yourself; a man full of contradictions and stuck in an eternal defensive attitude. Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. are both outstanding as father as son. Their explosive arguments and the entire dynamic of their relationship feels extremely genuine. All these unspoken resentments, all those little and bigger wounds that never really heal but fester over time are explored. The rest of the family dynamic, from the brothers with whom Hank (Downey) has a rather peaceful and tender relationship to the ex-girlfriend who seems to know him better than anyone, are interesting and authentic. No one is made too likable or given easy forgiveness; the character are nuanced and balanced.The courtroom drama was taken really seriously, too; it was thrilling to me and seemed very authentic. I loved the two other lawyers we encountered, and how different understandings of the law converge in one intense testimony scene. Nothing very Hollywoodesque to the courtroom narrative for me; it almost seemed European in its serious and professional tone (then I'm biased). No big reveal or unnecessary drama, just serious prosecution. Yes, this movie could have been shorter; yes, the story-line is neither original nor mind-blowing. Watch it for Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. and an outstanding supporting cast setting the screen ablaze with emotions; watch it because with all its random elements and bittersweetness and ambivalences, it feels a lot like real life."
" The Judge
",0.0,-0.9961,2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,"I assumed this film was a courtroom drama, it certainly has that aspect, but it is more a father-son story, and I mainly wanted to see it because it was part of awards season, directed by David Dobkin (Shanghai Knights, Wedding Crashers, The Change-Up). Basically in Chicago, successful and unethical defence attorney Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) has been estranged from his family for some time, they live in a small town in Indiana, Hank is also getting divorced, due to his wife's infidelity, this will also lead to a custody battle for his young daughter. He receives a call telling him that his mother has died, he flies to his hometown of Carlinville, there he reunites with his older brother Glen (Vincent D'Onofrio), a tire shop owner, and his younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong), an autistic aspiring filmmaker. Hank stops by the small county courthouse, he quietly enters to observe a case in progress, the judge is Joseph Palmer (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Robert Duvall), Hank's father, they are later reunited properly for the first time in years at the funeral, Joseph treats guests with kindness, but is cold towards his son. The next morning, as he is preparing to leave, Hank notices damage to his father's Cadillac Coupe DeVille, Joseph denies knowing how it happened, but Hank believes his father was drinking and driving, they have a heated, and Hank promises never to return. But after boarding the plane, Hank receives a call from his brother that Joseph is being questioned by police regarding a fatal hit and run, the victim is identified as recently released convicted murderer Mark Blackwell (Mark Kiely). Blackwell had previously been sentenced by Joseph after killing a teenager, his blood is found on the car, Joseph is indicted and prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) is seeking a conviction for first-degree murder, Hank agrees to defend Joseph. Hank learns that his father was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, this explains Joseph's inability to remember the accident and provides a potential defence, for diminished capacity (impaired mental functions), but Joseph rejects this defence, it could potentially damage his legacy. During the trial Hank and Joseph try to put aside their bitterness for each other, dating back to Hank as a teenager drinking and driving, causing an injury to Glen to put an end to a potential career in professional baseball, Joseph put Hank in a youth detention centre, and Hank left Carlinville after never hearing from his father following this. Hank reconnects with his former sweetheart Samantha Powell (Vera Farmiga), whom he abandoned at a Metallica concert over twenty years ago, he discovers she has a daughter, Carla (Leighton Meester), born nine months after he left, Hank believes he is the father, although it is later revealed to be Glen. During trial, Hank believes he has established enough reasonable doubt to result in an acquittal for his father, but Joseph sabotages the case, saying that although he has no memory the accident, he probably did kill Blackwell intentionally, he says that he was haunted by Blackwell's case, having seen Hank in Blackwell, wanting to help him like a son, he misread Blackwell and came to see Hank as being like him. Joseph is acquitted for murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison, but he is released in seven months on compassionate parole, due to his cancer becoming terminal. In the end, following his release, Hank and Joseph go fishing together, after acknowledging Hank as the best lawyer he knows, Joseph dies peacefully in the boat, having finally made peace with his father, Hank returns to the courtroom Joseph once reigned over, reminiscing on everything. Also starring Dax Shepard as C.P. Kennedy, Leighton Meester as Carla Powell, Ken Howard as Judge Warren, Emma Tremblay as Lauren Palmer, Balthazar Getty as Deputy Hanson, Sarah Lancaster as Lisa Palmer, David Krumholtz as Mike Kattan, Grace Zabriskie as Mrs. Blackwell and Denis O'Hare as Doc Morris. Having his career revived, following his sobriety issues, being in superhero and comedy movies, Downey Jr. almost manages a real world role as the cynical lawyer, and I can see reasons why Duvall was nominated awards, playing a constantly grouchy but troubled father, the other well-known stars, including Thornton, don't get as much to do. This could have been a really engaging courtroom drama, but it is fumbled by a predictable father- son relationship built on initial hatred turning slowly into respect for each other, the sentimental stuff gets a little bit clunky, but it is certainly an interesting enough story, overall an average drama. Worth watching!"
" Great performances an enjoyable serious film

The two are an estranged son and father, with RDJ returning to his small hometown to defend his father on a murder charge.Every performance in this film is A-List quality. The premise is a bit cliché but that's because it's honest...it's real. Ultimately, this is just a beautiful story about a father and a son finding their way back to each other.

We see in this film a very interesting father-son relationship but it is not only that, Hank's career is often questioned, as he has only clients guilty, privileging money and glory to his family life, whether his wife and daughter or his brothers and parents. After having had to return to the sources because of the death of his mother, he finds himself confronted with his past. But he must also, as a lawyer, represent his father, judge, suspected of murder and who prefers his honor and his integrity to freedom. A poignant film even more highlighted by the exceptional performance of RDJ and which deserves well a 9/10! I judge this movie excellent !"
" Cliché-filled Courtroom Drama
",0.0,0.882,2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)First off, the acting was good. Probably the highlight, even though Duvall and Downey Jr. stick within their expected roles. If only the story wasn't so template and didn't telegraph plot-points. Downey Jr. plays the big city, fast-talking lawyer with the quick wit and Duvall, his father, the small-town judge with squeaky clean morals. Son comes back home for mother's funeral and as the story unfolds around father's recent car accident, who big city lawyer son ends up defending him, their relationship and buried emotions begin to surface. Good acting around the overly-dramatic scenes, typically unrealistic courtroom scenes as well as the stereotypical divorced, single and attractive woman to mix it up with Downey Jr. It was a fine movie, something to pass the time and enjoy but certainly nothing to ponder for later."
" Academy award worthy movie.
",0.7506,0.9151,2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Personally my favorite movie of all time, i don't get rotten tomato! The movie was great in every aspect of it, couldn't ask for more actually, two legendary actors in one drama which is my favorite category, maybe i liked the movie because i could see myself in one or two of the characters, but i still loved the performance, writing, screenplay.. really couldn't ask for more. I still get shocked when people tell me that they never even heard of it! The judge is really underrated movie, either you experienced something in movie or not, you'll still get chills.. maybe a few tears. The ending really had me, i had to rewatch the movie to realize the references. Really couldn't ask for more, except asking the cast to do something like it."
" Not As Good As It Should Have Been
",-0.3412,-0.9031,2017-03-27 00:00:00,5,"Really looked forward to this film, although newspaper reviews were lukewarm, since I have always liked courtroom type stories. (My father was a lawyer). And with actors like Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr., how bad could it be? Answer: Not bad, really, but still disappointing. First, it was soooo long, nearly two-and-a-half hours, while the story wasn't all that complicated. Second, the script was what I call overwritten, meaning that much of what was said was very complex and sounded contrived, yet spoken very quickly, so it made me feel that the actors were just reciting their lines, not speaking from the heart. I think Duvall was better than Downey overall, as I find his glib style, similar to his awkward moments in ""Chef"", to be annoying after awhile, even obnoxious. Plus it was fairly predictable, even though it took almost forever to get there."
" A good family drama.
",0.4404,-0.5495,2017-02-09 00:00:00,5,"In this film, a son who graduated as a lawyer returns to his homeland, a small town in the country to see his father, who is a local court judge and with whom he has never had a good relationship. However, he ends up offering to defend him when the elderly judge is charged with murder. The best of the film is the story, a family drama that holds our attention from the beginning because the characters were so well developed psychologically that they end up touching us. Robert Downey Jr. and veteran Robert Duvall give life to son and father, respectively, and both are huge in their performances, being very good how they interact with each other in front of the camera. But neither are sympathetic characters. They are very similar, cranky and a little stern, and because they are very similar, they have difficulty living together. The rest of the cast plays secondary roles but gives good support to these two actors."
" A worthy shame
",-0.0516,0.8754,2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Downey Jr. and Duvall give outstanding performances in a movie that's criminally below par.Having said that, I would still revisit this every day just for the aforementioned's delightful chemistry and powerful repartee which is so on point, it truly made me feel their pain and inner turmoil even during inane scenes and over simplistic dialogue.Two stars for each Star -- and an extra for the exquisite Mr D'Onofrio whose robust presence and underused talent so desperately demand more screen time.Have a go, the performances will not disappoint you."
