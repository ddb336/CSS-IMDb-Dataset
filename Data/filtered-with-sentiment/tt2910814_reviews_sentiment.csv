" For movie lovers
",0.5267,0.9939,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"It's no academy award picture. But movie touches on youth, drama, coming of age, sci-fi, little action, love etc. I guess movies like this don't do well because it's so diverse in its setting that it doesn't exactly appeal to any specific category; ie someone who loves drama might be turned off by sci-fi themes, a sci-fi fan might not be interested in the slow pace and teenage drama.I however loved all the various elements, I think they compliment each other in a very entertaining manner. To top it off like most good movies, it adds a slight amount of romance.I think it's an 8, and by time it's over with some patience most movie lovers will enjoy this."
" Original sci-fi
",0.3182,0.908,2021-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed this film. Nice to see an original sci-fi film, with new ideas and surprises, and not an action bore-fest. Liked the ending too."
" Split in two
",0.0,0.9828,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"For the first 55 minutes or so I would have given it a 9 because it has a very very good suspense. You ask yourself ""what the f... ist going on here""? It is the kind of movie where mystery and thrill build up perfectly, very good, nearly perfect, and as the mysteries are solved you maybe are a little bit disappointed.
Again, filmmakers do a great job and the director should be watched closely, he knows how to do a great movie.... Story is less brilliant IMO"
" wild mix of art house and trash
",0.0,0.7747,2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Finally a genuine SF story, inexpensively implemented, but with a philosophical aspect that gives the viewer more than pure entertainment.
At the end the makers want a bit too much and some action scenes are confusing to unbelievable. Still worth watching."
" Don't listen to the nay sayers - a fresh SciFi and well worth your time
",0.6486,-0.6992,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"A journey of discovery for the audience and the storytellers without a great reveal. A great combination of story and tech without attempting to explain it all. It's a pity the ending scenes were so short a part of the movie as the real power and energy was just appearing. Watch it, it's worth it."
" Great idea, bad execution. Movie = Massive Cliff Hanger
",0.1531,0.9538,2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"The movie was pretty good, i would rate it 10/10, except for the fact that the director forgot something. The resolution. All good movies have a resolution of some kind. This movie ends right before the climax. This feels more like a first episode of a sci-fi TV show. This movie is just a cliff hanger. Like the movie ""How it ends"" literally ends with them driving away from a storm, its the climax. Same with ""Time Trap"" (or whatever it was called), that movie just ends at the climax. It got so good in the end."
" Great movie for Europe and rest of the world public (except USA)
",0.6249,0.9943,2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Finally great sci fi movie, but this movie is more than good story about strong bond between three friends who are suddenly find in the really uncommon circumstances & (unreal) environment and who try to understand what is hell happening with their (along side with the public)...
A really profound film immazed with tension and uncertainty to the end of the movie, made with a very limited budget and for all the sweetness of good sci-fi movies, but of course if I will watched movies by the ratings of ""reviews"" who are mostly from the United States, then my movie education would be very, very poor. I don't insult anyone's intelligence or to dare to impose some viewers, because everyone has the right to love something or don't. But here's a short example of this: as some fantastic far eastern (Korean, Japanese, Indonesian, Arabian, Turkish) movie's are inconceible american audiences for different speaking areas and seafood are the very fact that they watch phil with a translation that is not in their native language, and therefore a lot of negative reviews with films like, ""I see the devil"", ""Raid"", ""YU-ON"", ""Underground"", ""PRETTY VILLAGES PRETTY FLAME"" etc. Of course I don't mean the entire U.S. audience here, certainly there are people in America who love and know how to recognize a good movie, whether it's high-budget, whether authorial or festival-like, yet most American audiences (primarily teenagers) are used to expensive blockbuster and costumed superheroes, so I'm not surprised that this movie got the big No.
I said, I don't disrespect anyone, everyone has a right to their own taste, as far as ""seventh art"" is concerned, but it's the biggest audience in the world who's used to watch all sorts of reality TV shows and expensive, and equally worthless, action movies, and I'm inconce emissible to watch to the end a masterpiece such as ""MOTHER"", TREE OF LIVE, ENTER TO AVOID, IRREVERSIBLE, etc. I'm advising you not to waste your time on this movie but to watch ""Star Wars"" newer productions and they don't write all kinds of nonsense here...
To me, this film is certainly deeper than movies like Underwater, District 9, Cloverfield paradox etc. Whereas for all true fans of scifi films with mild elements of horror...
My respects to all who took their time to take a look at Phil and write reviews, regardless of their grades and a big greeting from a small country in Southeast Europe..."

It leaves you with simple conclusion, that is SO SIMPLE you are not accepting and therefore you look for some deeper meaning to actually meaningless movie.SO, watch this for some interesting atmosphere, but don't try to find ""Morpheus"" depth in it, because there is none.Visually interesting, but pointless or in best case simple story. To make it short... bla bla bla, we are not living on the Earth.GRRRR! I hate good movies with way to simplified endings.I do have to say this is one of those movies that can develop into franchise if they try to. And it is one of those rare movies sequel can be rated much higher if they do it right!"
" Makes no sense

",-0.6124,0.8381,2020-10-27 00:00:00,3,Amazing opportunity to deliver a brilliant dystopian sci-fi cult film ruined by Hollywood's interests.Terrible shame as the pacing is on point but it would take 2 more hours to fully bring the movie to a satisfying climax. The current ending feels like a cheap 'get out jail free' card that utterly ruins an otherwise extremely well set up piece.Absolute shame.
" Stop reading these pretentious reviews and enjoy this great movie
",0.783,0.9783,2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Seems like many people here are not happy unless they have their avenger movie packed with special effects and always the same plot. ""The Signal"" is a different movie, very well made and surely different from what the mainstream movie industry has got us used to watch. Is it perfect? No it is not. Starting from the weird final act and ending with the many inconsistencies in the plot. There are many things that could be made better. However, it is a movie made of ideas rather than a prepackaged plot, it is smart and original, it is entertaining, thrilling and suspenseful from the first to the last minute. All packaged with a good acting.
In a time where most of the movies look pretty much the same it is refreshing to watch something different."

Some things are illogical and don't make a lot of sense. Also, not very Sci-Fi-ish in my opinion.
But the worst thing is when you get to the end and realize that you set 90+ minutes and got nowhere.

Every potentially cool detail was completely lost in a pointless void. We couldn't cheer for the good side or hate the bad side because we were like ""wait is that a cow?"" And the end could not possibly move any slower or provide less closure."

Did Aliens wipe the earth ? is this an army experiment? is it a virus or something else? that's a very good side of the movie, at least it leaves you guessing and it's well narrated enough to keep you watching.The main issue is, like most of those movies, they're building the story and then in 10 minutes they're giving everything away. We don't care about how people are feeling in distressing moment, we want to know what's happening. It's like one would make a whole movie about someone who is sure there is something behind a mountain, and the movie stops when they've passed that mountain. It's a whole different story on the other side, a much more interesting one, but a harder one to write..."
" I Want You To Go!!!!

Oh yeah Bates Motel.So they are trying to track some hacker or something? Kinda lost on the goal. And Haley is going off to a school or something and things are rough between her and Nick. Their tracking leads to this unlit house in the middle of nowhere, which they enter . Are they nuts? Without guns? And of course they are there in the dark armed with only flashlights. What morons. While they are in there, they hear Haley screaming. They rush back outside but she is gone!! They think they see her or hear here and chase off... and fade to black...Next Nic is in some wheelchair hooked to an IV in some apparent lab being questioned by Jack Crawford. In some full astronaut suit , questioning him about 'The Signal.' Crawford or aka Damon in this movie tells Nick that he's been in contact wiht EBE's. So Nick is being held in one of the biggest hospital rooms ive ever seen.So random weirdness happens. Haley is being held there also. Nick discovers that his legs are gone and have been replaced by some kind of constructs. Nick gets all upsetty and drags Haley out of the complex with him. They hitch a ride with LOL Lin Shaye!!! Awesome!!!+1 Star for Lin Shaye giving them a ride!!!!So they get to some hillbilly diner in the middle of the desert. How they've managed to avoid pursuit is beyond me. Surely there are tons of resources available to their pursuers.

LOL that was pretty cool really.But ahead Crawfod is waiting with many forces. A spike strip causes Nick to crash the truck. Nick and Haley are once again captive. But wait, Nick still has super legs!!!! Ruh Roh what was that loud noise????? Nick finally pieces together than it was DAMON aka CRawford that produced the Signal they had followed that started all this mess. And he takes off with blazing speed on his newly acquired legs.Whatevr barrier Nick breaks ,, the reveal comes that Damon aka Crawford is some sort of Alien Tech Brain .And where is he actually??? In some sort of Alien matrix??? Okay that was weird and that was the end!!!!-1 Star for that ending I was very disappointed in it.5/10"
" Great scifi movie very underrated!!
",0.6892,0.9871,2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"As usual you get a great movie and people overanalyze it!! Its scifi so it's going to be different come on do we actually know what aliens do,are,their powers or lack thereof . So it's up to the writer and director to give their view of a scifi. Pretty much everyone makes the aliens smarter more technology advanced and they are here to kill us!! Our defenses are futile against them and we get lucky and something easy wins the day, like oxygen, or their windows compatible, or ??? This movie is none if those it's an original excellent and best of all entertaining movie!!! P.s. Lin shaye is an extremely underrated, undervalued actress!! Given the right vehicle she'd win an oscar!!!!"

" Glad I watched it.
",0.4588,0.936,2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,I enjoy a good sci-fi and The Signal has a lot going for it. The scenes are not rushed and they're well edited. The soundtrack was nice too.If you're looking for where the movie is lacking it's probably the story telling. There's not a lot of explaining going on so knowing what going on and why is not talked about much. You get to see what's happening at the time and that's it. Lucky for me I like that in a movie.
" A Good Mystery With Unanswered Questions

" The Signal distorts its amplified paranoid frequency creating high-pitched sci-fi perplexities.
",-0.296,0.99,2020-06-20 00:00:00,5,"Choices of morality. The conflict between sound logical reasoning and overwhelming emotional burden. It is the fundamental laws of human nature to base decisions around both outputs, whether the resultant event is a success or failure. It defines who we are as an intelligent species with the capacity of emotional thought and subconscious. Remove that, and humanity is relinquished. Nic, Jonah and Haley, three MIT students on a road trip to California, seize the opportunity to track an infamous hacker down in the middle of Nevada (IP address bouncing through TCP based on ominous emails sent to Nic, which surprisingly is somewhat accurate...). They encounter an abandoned house and, after a bright white light shrouds their peripheral visions, Nic eventually wakes up in a clinically sterile underground research facility when he is then questioned about his encounter with ""the signal"".Eubank's low-budget sci-fi thriller is undoubtedly ambitious in terms of scope. Much like his manipulation with the characters, the cerebral aesthetic of the story allows him to influence the audience's minds with plenty of narrative twists. Each twist circumnavigating the metaphorical nature of Eubank's screenplay, exploring the audacious conflict between logic and emotion. An effective divulgence that only comes into fruition due to the introductory, albeit surface-level, characterisation of the three main friends. Particularly Nic and Haley whom are in a strained relationship, with the former not wanting his disability to hold her back. A calculated decision that suppresses the emotional distress within, however the story's twisted events allow Nic to discover the immensity of one emotion. Love. Whilst this sentiment is superficial in terms of its developed manifestation throughout the feature, with their relationship rarely progressing from a few heartfelt stares, it does produce some required characterisation to accentuate ""the signal"".Another distinctive quality Eubank possesses, is his visual style. With much attention driven towards gorgeous slow-motion frames of raging water torrenting down a jagged river and the eventual chaos as these friends attempt to escape the facility. Lanzenberg's cinematography is impeccable, flawless even.The same cannot be said for the bulk of the story however. Initially, the search for the hacker was shrouded in realism and delicately focused on the friendships of the protagonists. Then the piercing light blinds them. Slowly but surely, the story concedes to enthusiastic sci-fi tropes that inject overpowering noise within its frequency modulation. Distorting the primary emotional focus with distractions that liken the plot to Plato's philosophical 'Allegory of the Cave' through the projection of false perceptions manufactured by another entity. The more the signal heightens its pitch, the louder its bombastic temperament becomes. Eubank's determination to remain mysterious until the very last scene, which undoubtedly forced many eye-rolling and face-palming opportunities, ultimately created dissatisfaction upon reliance of the absurd. The character depth dissipates and the narrative gradually incoherent, alongside inconsistent pacing. Thwaites, Cooke and Knapp, whilst functional, become lost in the midst of the mind-bending disarray. Failing to create empathy. Shaye's minuscule presence however was delightfully idiosyncratic.For what it's worth, Eubank's The Signal is an admirable attempt at harmonising human emotions with logical thinking. Through the absurdities of sci-fi tropes, it hoped to convey human self-reflection. Instead, the exceedingly stylish visuals and eventual plot destination overwhelm the resonance of humanity, weakening the strength of this particular cinematic signal. Ambitious, yet flawed."

I don't know why they have to show love angle at the first place in that movie as it's impossible to connect a emotion with Nic & Hayley relationship and because of this it's look irritating every time Nic tries to meet/save Hayley who is in coma and ignore his friend Jonah who told him that NOMAD & co. are doing something wrong with his arm. The movie could be a better short movie for about 40-45 minutes and it's look like they expanded this movie with many unusual things

Remember when you'd go to the wrong page and read a middle page instead of the ending and suddenly your story didn't make sense anymore? Yeah, that's The Signal. So, if you enjoyed botching up your twist-a-plots as a kid, then you'll absolutely love this film.By the way, the stars I gave it were for how beautiful I thought the filmography was, how artistic and visual it was, and how good the acting was. But none of that will be memorable because the story liquifies the brain and ruins the rest of what makes this an otherwise good film...I think."

If they spend that much effort to kidnap various individuals why is their first reaction to some random unfortunate interaction to shoot people? Seems like a big old waste of time. All the badguys have lots of guns and don't have a problem shooting. But the main baddy carries his gun in a stupid red briefcase to conceal it and makes a production out of pulling it out? Dumb. Having Laurence Fishburne in your movie and then just have him regurgitate Morphius-lite lines is annoying. The flashbacks without any context to their meaning are lame. Overall it's a movie made by people who saw other, better movies, copied elements but didn't bother to figure out what the narrative of this one was going to be about. I mean if your 'big payoff' in the end is just confirming that, ""yes our characters in our alien abduction movie were kidnapped by aliens"", you really aren't moving the story along. It gets a second star because at least it was in focus and had proper lighting for the most part."
" Marmite movie

All that artsy fartsy crap helped drag the movie down. No one on earth likes it except the director and his friends at Sundance.The ending was a bit nonsensical and created more questions than it answered. Plus, it's been done better in films like The Truman Show and Dark City, and many others where the big reveal at the end is that your whole world is a big lie. In fact, it was nearly identical to Dark City.The plot seemed to meander and make little sense. We never knew why we should care about these characters, or what chasing a hacker had to do with space aliens, or why Lawrence Fishburne had to keep everything a big secret, or why they had to get robot legs and hands, and what exactly Haley's super powers were...plus we never got to see her use them to fight the bad guys.A bigger budget would have allowed for better special effects which this movie sorely needed."
" Mostly predictable but it's the worst when is not
",-0.7684,-0.8942,2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,"There are several plot twists in this movie, most of them are predictable. Those that are not, are maybe the worst. Yes you do not have to explain everything to create a good movie, but don't leave too many loose treads. This movie definitly leaves too many: 1. We don't even know if the spaceship is human made - machine made or alien made. Both would be possibilities, in my opinion it is hinted that humans / human made machines have manufactured it (that's why there is an identification number on the ship). 2. Why are they abducting people? 3. Why are they sucking their ""minds out""? A lot of people are brainless in the story, can't remember why they are there. 4. Ok, they are experementing on earth lifeforms (remember the cow), but why the hell by creating such a bad enviroment? 5. At the beginning Haley throws away the necklace which was a gift from Nic. How did the necklace get back to her? 6. Why blowing the peoples brains out and using earthlike technology as a spacefaring civilization?
So, at the end, there are too many unanswared questions. The ending twist also does not feel right because of the unexplained things in the story. The movie had good potential (the main idea of an alien presenting himself as a government agent that investigates alien abductions is good), but it failed to deliver."
" A Technically Competent Almost Failure.
",-0.1796,-0.9306,2020-04-26 00:00:00,4,"As I was wrapping this movie up I was already thinking ""5 stars"" And then they end it with two unrelated still images presented like an image screensaver. I hope they at least credited the artists they got those images from.The movie opens with some basically needless and overly drawn out ""character development"". Initially I thought that they had done a decent job of showing the relationship between the three in an efficient manner. Then it just kept going, introducing a pointless conflict that adds nothing to the movie but run time and some awkward interactions immediately following.
However, it does an okay job of establishing who these characters are, even if none of that matters for the actual movie, which does start until almost 20 minutes in. I had to check that because it felt more like 45 minutes while watching it.Unfortunately, the main characters are basically unlikable. Their actions feel unmotivated and forced. Not sure if that is the actors or the writing at fault here. I suspect the latter, as I am fairly certain Fishburne's direction included ""Just like morpheus, but secretly evil"". I mean, he did that well because he's a great actor, but it wasn't very surprising when he turned out to be, what I can only assume was, the ""bad guy"".What follows is a compilation of the main character behaving irrationally angry in conflict to his established character in the opening scenes and Fishburne's character doing everything possible to try to misdirect the viewer.Characters seem to all make the worst possible decisions and communicate with other characters as little as possible in order to move the plot along. Characters also seem to just not react to the reality of the situation they are in, electing, rather, to behave in whatever manner will push that plot forward, regardless of whether it is logical or makes sense.Still, despite the problems, it was made technically well. Given the budget they seem to have done a decent job throughout the movie of keeping it looking good. Well, except for the art slideshow at the end. Also, the audio mixing was horrid early on, with dialog in some scenes quieter than the ambient room noise of the scene. I abhor having to turn up movies for dialog, only to get blasted out of my seat when the scene changes.I didn't find myself rooting for anyone, or even really caring what happened to them, but I was intrigued by where the story might be heading. Up until the somewhat predictable ending it felt like a technically competent movie that suffers the typical problems that many modern sci fi movies fall into. The story and plot rely heavily on convenience and common sci fi tropes, but I never felt the need to just turn it off. Maybe I was getting a bit impatient for the film to just get to the point, but it managed to keep me watching, even if just to see if the movie could offer anything substantial.Unfortunately, The Signal ends up a mostly forgettable somewhat disappointing example of amateur filmmaking."
" Among THE BEST Sci-fi movies ever made!!
",0.7592,0.993,2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,This is such a great representation of what a true Sci-fi genre movie should be. Starts out like any other day in a normal persons life. Along the way something truly profound happens. Something so alien to our regular reality that the brain just cant process it. Then as the realization of what can only be the truth sets in the mind starts fitting all the pieces together. Once the acceptance of whats happening comes over you you're left with a sense of pure awe. Thats exactly how this movie plays out from beginning to end without giving away any of the plot points. I would put this in the category of one of the best top 10 Sci-fis ever made. Thats why i gave it a 9 out of 10. I only had 1 problem with the movie and that was the girlfriend. Something happened with both of the guys that you and they eventually understood and recovered from physically but more importantly mentally. She was just in a daze from beginning to end with no explanation of what if anything had happened. The only hint we get is when he sees the button sized piece of alien tech inbetween her shoulder blades. Thats it! What happened to her? The actors performances were all great. You could actually feel with them every emotion that was going on. The limited special effects saved till the ending finale was a perfect choice. I loved the slow motion camera captures that built up to the explosive action scenes. Just a great adventure and steady build up of plot that pays off in the last few scenes of the movie. Where and how it ends leaves you with a sense of awe. I definitely recommend this to everyone whether youre into Sci-fi or not youll have fun unravelling this one.

OK that was clear after about 10 minutes but it just dragged on and on while you wait impatiently for something to happen.

Quite frankly this adaptation should have been given to actors in their late twenties or early thirties with a much
Better credibility factor , and less prescribed teen drama formulas.The Twilight Zone, a pioneer series in this sort of topic , had a similar but compact episode called : ""A Stopover in a Quiet Town""

" The Signal Fades Fast
",0.0,-0.752,2019-01-26 00:00:00,2,"Yes. I'm the spoiler guy. I make spoils on spoiled films. Don't worry too much please. You've probably already seen this one and are just cruising the reviews looking for confirmation that your perception that this film was a stinker is correct.It is. Your perception that is. Correct.Three friends: Crutches, Buck Tooth, and the girl are on a road trip from presumably MIT to somewhere in California when they snag a chance to get back at the evil hacker guy NOMAD who snuck into their servers back at school and spilled their private IP addresses all over the internet.Something like that. It's not too clear, but that's okay. This isn't a hacker movie thank goodness, although at first I thought it might be. It's more of a teen angst slow motion crap cow that wants to sneak in a few Blair witch moments in between the breakup sads. At least at first.Call me old-fashioned, but I like me a little continuity in my flicks. Hope that's not too much to ask. See, the three amigos are getting closer to NOMAD's place, some spot in Nevada. How much farther? asks Crutches. Twenty miles says Buck Tooth. It's bright blazing daytime during this exchange, but after they travel the twenty miles, it's pitch dark. I guess they could have stopped for pizza and bowling, but if so, those scenes were cut. More likely is that the director thought that the shaky cam stuff works better at night.After a bit of stomach lunching shadow stomping, everything goes black and Crutches wakes up to find Morpheus (that is, Laurence Fishburne, which is the only reason I decided to watch this thing) staring at him from inside a Hazmat suit. Of course, Morpheus isn't Morpheus this time around, but rather Dr. Damon which is NOMAD spelled backwards (oops) and he informs Crutches that they're in some sort of super secret secure facility to keep the aliens from infecting the whole world - or something like that.Later - as in many days later - Crutches falls off the bed and discovers his legs are made of weird extraterrestrial metal instead of his usual dilapidated flesh. He freaks - and while he's freaking - I'm wondering how he failed to notice for so long. Sure, he was in a wheelchair, but even a paraplegic could touch himself through his PJs and wonder why his pinky finger made a dull pinging sound on his thigh.More of the same for quite a while until the three amigos get back together after a harrowing escape in which the guards literally pass within feet of the escapees but fail to notice because they're engrossed with Facebook on their IPhones or something.More slow mo, then some slower slow mo in case you were on the verge of waking up, then a big bout of HULK SMASH! as Buck Tooth - who has grown enormous metal hands - grimaces his best grimace while reducing concrete to powder.Needless to say, nothing ever comes of anything. In the end, it was all for naught, and the more that is revealed, the more you realize that the whole thing was just a giant misdirection to try and keep you from noticing that this film has no substance and nothing to say. It tries to be something for everyone from love sick teens to sci-fi fans to those who get giddy over Freddy Kruger. But at last - as it must - it falters, falls, and dissolves into a meaningless puddle of goo. The signal is dead."

" Close, but no cigar
",-0.4215,-0.9322,2019-01-20 00:00:00,5,"This low-budget science-fiction movie with a Philip K. Dick / Twilight Zone flavor is a nice showcase for director William Eubank, who does a solid job and shows potential. Sadly, as is often the case when a young director pulls double duty as a writer, the script is not as strong as the visuals.Nic (Brenton Thwaites), Haley (Olivia Cooke) and Jonah (Beau Knapp) follow the signal by a mysterious genius hacker to a secluded cabin in the middle of nowhere. After a shocking night, Nic wakes up in a secret government facility where a scientist (Laurence Fishburne) tells him he has been the victim of alien abduction. Nic is now a prisoner and strives to escape, discover what happened to him and find his friends.The Signal is fond of cool moments where characters rage with emotions, time slows down, visuals look neat, silent flashbacks kick in... Storytelling isn't quite as proficient though. Pacing is off, characterization wonky. The protagonists are relatable at first, but after the accident each of them becomes so one-note - Nic brims with sullen hostility for the whole second half of the film, while Haley is tearful and wide-eyed - they get tiresome.The film runs at brisk (in theory) 97 minutes but still overstays its welcome for me. Pity, because it had potential. I think I'll give Eubank's upcoming Underwater a try, though.5/10"
" A Sharp, Superb Sci Fi Thriller
",0.6705,0.9866,2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"19 December 2014. Apparently it doesn't take tens of millions, much less hundreds of millions of dollars to craft a brilliant, superb sci fi thriller. It takes about $4,000,000 in fact. The Signal takes the best of the sound effects and set design from Solaris (1972, 2002), the eerie set up and home technique video, and the ghostly shadows of The Blair Witch Project (1999), the futuristic design, including food trays of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968); the surrealistic sequence of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). What one ends up with is a fabulous immersive voyage into a conspiracy-like surreal world of the known and the unknown that perhaps includes morality that doesn't quite fit with our own.The acting and performances are top-notch, appealing. The relational themes are compelling. Even Laurence Fishburne's under-played acting approach, the only well recognized actor in the movie, is well suited for his role. Interestingly while the plot and its elements are surprisingly simple, it is the direction and photography that are crisp and serious that make this movie original in its presentation, a fresh look at themes already used over and over in film, a much more difficult accomplishment.By the end, one has experienced Interstellar (2014) like outcomes, reflective of other polished films such as Love (2011), Moon (2009) and the sublime presentations of Oblivion (2013), Gattaca (1997), Passengers (2008), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Slip Stream (2007), Stranded (2001). I would identify this movie most closely with the tone and approach of Splice (2010) and Wave Length (1983) or the convolutions of THX-1138 (1971) or the helter skelter of Brazil (1985) and even Idaho Transfer (1973)."

Well, if we would have been signaled to skip this one, we probably would have. Not to say there weren't flashes of creativity, but mostly, just mis-mixed signals.This sci-fi thriller follows 3 highly intelligent MIT students, Nic, Haley, and Jonah who start out on a road trip and end up with an out of this world adventure. After attempting to track down a hacker by the name of NOMAD, our star Nic, who is struggling with adapting to living with muscular dystrophy, wakes up in a sterile, hospital-like environment with no memory of how he got there. In comes Morpheus, we mean Damon, played by Laurence Fishburne. He continues to confuse everyone and provides little to no answers about what Nic is experiencing. But, added bonus, bionic legs! (so technically he doesn't have 10 toes). A cross between The Matrix and The Cube, this movie has similarities of both where the leads were either kidnapped or ingested a blue pill to be transported to a floating (device) above earth. Why the ""aliens"" wanted to experiment with metal limbs and cows is still unknown. At least the aliens kept Morpheus's face.Most likely to win a fight against The Hulk: Jonah and the bionic arms vs. green super human strength - Jonah is definitely the winner here, if he were still alive.Favorite old lady: Mirabelle, wasn't she everyone's favorite?!

Unfortunately, the ending is a supreme let down. I think the writer believed this was some sort of mind-blowing philosophical twist, but it's cliche and meaningless. I might have been impressed by the amateur twist when I was a kid, but I've seen too many films to do more than roll my eyes at this conclusion.

The mystery presented by the screenplay is creepy and unsettling. The cast is great and completely believable in their roles. The movie pays a lot of attention to the little details of their world-building (for instance that is a genuine TCP conversation rolling by on the screens of the laptop as the two hackers try to track down their nemesis in the first 10 minutes ) The movie looks great (especially for the relatively small budget) and every dollar of the budget appears on screen.So what's the problem? Well, the movie is either 20 minutes too long or an hour too short. The big twist and reveal at the end, while better than anything Shymalan has done in 15 years, leaves the viewer wanting more and full of unanswered questions. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of successful movies out there that pull this same trick (""Blair Witch Project"", ""2001"", and ""Skyline"" come to mind), but I found it especially disappointing here. (I especially don't understand what SPOILER ALERT!!!
..the aliens hope to accomplish by amping up human subjects with ""techno-organic"" cyborg parts - for instance, the hero can now run at hundreds of MPH, but one heat seeking missile, and he'd be history.)

It never does.Unsatisfying conclusion that doesn't explain much but shows enough to let the viewer know he was just gypped out of 1.5 hours of life they can never get back.The only saving grace of this film was Lawrence Fishburne, who as always, was superb and kept you hanging on his every word. I don't know how they got him for this movie but he was the only thing standing between it and complete irrelevance."

",0.2382,0.9881,2018-08-11 00:00:00,6,"The Eubanks' ""The Signal"" plays with its audience in ways acceptable and (mostly) unacceptable. It's dressed up in quite a slick way, with some natural beauty, an interesting-ish ""who is the mystery hacker?"" start-point, some reasonable looking hi-tech and so on; and it also mixes normal film storytelling with ""found footage"". But it somehow finds time for an entirely irrelevant first mini-scene, and indeed, though it's not exactly lengthy at 93 minutes including credits, a viewer not possessed with the patience of Job is going to find the fast-forward button a VERY tempting option. Truly speaking, there is 15 minutes of content here and no amount of special effects or portentous dialogue can disguise the fact that we're left ENDLESSLY hoping for enlightenment and spectacular plot development that does come a little bit in fact ... but by the time it does we've already given up much or most of any hope with which we may have come to or started the film.Ironically, against that background, we are never fully shown what is going on here, while our characters are forgettable in the extreme. Laurence Fishburne's is the best-known face, but his unwillingness to really help or be nice is EVEN MORE tiresome for the audience than it is for the characters.No spoilers on plot here at all, and somewhere down the line ""The Signal"" may indeed have an interesting SHORT story to tell. It might conceivably be described as ""cult"" sci fi - but to be a member of that cult you're going to need have no more-pressing alternative engagements of any kind whatsoever..."

The Brenton Thwaites (sp)? character (Nick) is the protagonist, but he tends to reach a bit too much and sort-of overacts the protagonist archetype - becoming nearly unlikable. But his stubbornness with the role actually works to his advantage when viewing the film in its entirety.For Lawrence Fishbourne, this role is old-hat. He's been playing this character since ""the Matrix."" Speaking of that movie... there are some parallels to be found in here. The rest of the cast are mostly mannequins - the typical GF, the best buddy, some quirky locals, etc. The settings are pretty standard, but the editing and effects are well done and the ending will surprise you."

I couldve drew a much better alien. And IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET TO THE POINT AND I STILL DONT KNOW WHAT THE POINT WAS. We checked to see how much more time was in the movie when we thought it was almost over and there was still 30 minutes left. I feel like I spent 20 years watching this movie.

Amazing it was even made in today's climate of superhero crap and cookie cutter overproduced garbage that leans on nothing but special effects and is written for 5th graders. I'd say that makes this one a real accomplishment for the real sci-fi fans among us. More like this please.

" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,0.9726,2018-07-23 00:00:00,4,"By it's very nature, science fiction is going to be unusual, confusing, and sometimes just plain weird. When it's done correctly, that can be a very good thing, but when it's not done the right way, audiences are left confused and annoyed. In 2014's The Signal, three friends are on a road trip, headed back to school for another semester of higher education. To their disbelief, a hacker who had been bothering them for months is still at it and is making things personal. Nic, Haley, and Jonah have some tricks of their own and ultimately track down the hackers address. To no ones surprise, it's on their way to school and they decide to pay them a visit. What should have been a fun moment, turned into something more sinister, when a deadly scream leads to darkness, and Nic (Brenton Thwaits) winds up in a quarantined hospital with no memory of what happened that night. I enjoyed the premise of this movie and as far as story goes, the idea wasn't all that terrible, what was terrible was the way in which it was presented. This buddy road trip film ends up in a hospital, where the friends are held for way too long. The hospital scenes are just strange, unexplained, and kill the movies momentum. Towards the end there are some better scenes, hinting that the film may be building up to an epic conclusion, but it's just more of the same, as things take an even stranger turn, and an anti-climatic one at that. As for the stars of the film, Laurence Fishburn gives yet another flat robotic performance. Morpheus was the perfect character for this guy, but he never seemed to be able to leave him behind, and now plays this same role in every film. On the other side, Brenton Thwaites, somewhat known for his breakout performance in The Giver, made this film for me. He was enigmatic, on target, and just fun to watch. I said it in my review of the Giver and I'll say it agin, this kid is going places. The Signal had all the ingredients for a great science fiction film, but when the cake was done it didn't taste so good. Most of the acting was flat, the story went off in too many different directions, and it was frequently anti-climatic."

I made the right choice, this movie was amazing and well done science fiction. It plays on different conspiracy theories if you pay attention you can easily pick them up. I'm convinced people that didn't enjoy this film simply need everything explained in every movie they watch I mean SPELLED OUT for them. It was easy for me to make connections and I found the film brilliant. Everything is in fact explained but you need to pay attention to put it together. It's not just told to you. It's a film that keeps you interested and really stimulating your thought process. Other words, if you need a simple action sci-fi then this is above your thought process skip it. If you like a brilliant movie that keeps you thinking then this is for you. The twists were exciting and the cgi was incredible for the budget I was pleasantly surprised. I give it a 10 for all over quality from the plot twist to the action cgi it's a cool movie and I especially loved the ending."

Sometimes these images are clear, sometimes blurred, sometimes shaky point-of-view shots (somebody watched _Blair Witch_). Why are these different shots used? Who know? Just like all the flashbacks shot as dream sequences. Why? Who knows. In fact, most of the movie is a series of ""why's"" followed by ""who knows"" answers.

Not to mention, the last shot of movie was nicely done opening up the possibilities in the viewers mind.Keep in mind though, it's NOT a movie with a lot of action, it's more focused on human emotions and that will probably not work for everybody (who gets easily bored without pew pew action :P )."

The Area 51 premise, with the weirdo extras, roads, earth vehicles, doesn't work with the ending. The limb replacement is not explained and does not drive the plot. By the way, there is no plot.I feels suspiciously like half the script blew away on a windy night and then the writer desperately jammed the scenes they had left together in a hodge-podge of fail.This could have been a good movie - -it just needed to be tied together with LOGIC."
" Obtuse sci-fi thriller
",0.1027,0.3252,2017-03-10 00:00:00,4,"THE SIGNAL is a low rent and somewhat laborious sci-fi thriller that tells a story with familiar concepts. It's one of those films which seems to go out of its way to be deliberately obtuse, throwing in imagery and slow, dream-like moments instead of providing concentrate plotting. The story is about three people who visit a remote installation where a hacker has been interfering with their lives. Once inside, they discover something very odd indeed.Films like this always seem to me to be less clever than they think they are. Certainly THE SIGNAL makes you work hard trying to figure what's going on but it's only at the very end that the final twist is revealed. I found it largely disappointing, mainly because similar stories have been playing out in the likes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS for decades and there's little new here. Some of the effects aren't bad and there's a nice impassive turn from Laurence Fishburne, but the film further suffers from having such dull lead characters."
" Better Than Expected, well thought-out film making.
",0.6124,0.9057,2017-03-09 00:00:00,6,"This is a solid science fiction story based on an extraterrestrial encounter our three protagonists while trying to track down the hacker Nomad, who has been recently plaguing their lives.The start of the film is pretty slow and the soundtrack does feel a little depressing, given that we are on a road trip with three friends I thought the soundtrack could be a little more happy and carefree as it adds an unnecessary and incorrect feel to the film at this time. However, as the film progresses the music melds better with the situations and feelings the writers, Carlyle Eubank, David Frigerio, and William Eubank (who also directed), wanted to portray, which is mainly a sense of loss, confinement, and hopelessness. I really loved the way the Nima Fakhrara built up the entire soundtrack to a climax at the end of the movie, just like an electronic symphony. Well thought out and respect due.As previously stated, the film starts slow and I nearly turned off, but I have learnt to at least give a film twenty minutes as this could just be scene setting and character building. In this case, it was just that. You learn of the relationships between the three friends, Nic, Jonah, and Hayley; the reason for the road trip and their ongoing trials and tribulations. This builds a realistic and credible storyline with characters you can relate to and believe in.All the actors give good performances though it's Laurence Fishburne, who portrays the governmental figure of Damon, who steals the show. No matter what happens, he always keeps his composure, never overreacting whatever the situation. It's only Hayley's character, played sparingly by Olivia Cooke, that seems a little flat, maybe the male writers haven't got in touch with their feminine sides yet.This is a slow burner of a film which builds slowly up to major reveals, action sequences, and the big reveal at the end, which you know is coming because in sci-fi something big has to be revealed. All of this is handled superbly by the director William Eubank. Once I got through the beginning I really enjoyed this tale, there are enough strange happenings to keep you enthralled and wondering WTF is going on? However, there are also disjointed flashbacks, which only serve to confuse, but this may be the director trying to show Nic's confusion of the situation, though, this didn't work for me.If you love science fiction then this film is worth at least one watch."
" Brilliantly unpredictable
",0.6124,0.9539,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"It's been a long time since I didn't predict the conclusion of a film and this picture had me guessing incorrectly all of the way through. Right up until the end I was thinking that as far as $4 million budget is concerned this film is a masterpiece. However, the slow pace became a little tiresome and the ending (or rather the conclusion) left me feeling a little unfulfilled for several reasons. I suppose I just wanted a bigger ending, and I always, always want to find out more about the eventual destination. Perhaps that's the point of these films, i.e. the pleasure is in the journey rather than the conclusion. Maybe I'm disappointed because I didn't solve the puzzle. Perhaps it is because I felt as if I'd seen this film before - because I've seen Fire in the Sky, Dark City, The Trumen Show and Oblivion. It is worth repeating that this is a really well made film, especially considering the budget and it is worth the journey for any sci-fi fan. I honestly think this film would've won awards if it was edited down to 30 minutes and submitted as a short-story. It had a very Philip K Dick / Arthur C Clarke 70's feel to it which I believe was intentional and it worked wonderfully. The whole build up of the film relies upon today being the age of the internet as the protagonists search for the physical location of an IP address and the origins of the mystery. Once found, the cinematography switches to something akin to Capricorn One (people are even using tape-recorders) and from that point forward it's time to enjoy the ride of trying to figure out the conspiracy, if indeed there is one.."
