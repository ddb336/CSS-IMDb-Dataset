" The best documentary I've ever seen
",0.6369,0.9675,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this documentary it was very interesting and very sad I liked the way it was done with phone footage and archive footage so i would definitely recommend to anyone wether an Amy winehouse fan or not I think anyone will like this it was fab deserved all the awards it was given.
" Amy (2015, Asif Kapadia) Wonderful Winehouse doc! One of the year's BEST films!
",0.8811,0.9857,2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Amy (2015, Asif Kapadia)
This is a brilliantly tender yet uncompromising look at the meteoric rise and fall of Amy Winehouse who took the music world by storm in 2007 with her old school soul album 'Back to Black.' Immediately embraced and thrust into the celebrity spotlight for her throwback vocal talent she was almost as quickly lampooned for her very public battle with drugs and alcohol which ultimately lead to her untimely death in 2011 at the age of 27 joining too many vital young stars to die at that age. Asif Kapadia gets an unprecedented amount of access to Winehouse's friends and family and their home movies to paint a truly full picture of this normal English girl blessed with a gift that thrust her to a level of fame which she was never capable of handling. It is interesting to see because this is one of the first documentaries I recall for someone at this age where so much of her life is documented on film even prior to becoming famous and this really aids the film in painting a full portrait of this girl. We get to know her very well through those home movies well prior to her ever becoming a household name when she is just another girl with great voice. It becomes heartbreaking to watch knowing the end that is in store for her as late night talk shows that had her on to sing her amazing hits go on to make scathing humor out public downward spiral into addiction. For many people the caricature that Winehouse became at the end is really what she came to embody. Instead, watching this picture, you begin to fully understand how things could spin so far out of control for her and those around her. She was surrounded by friends who were worried while being ultimately helpless to stop her. Her romantic relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil and her relationship with her father both seemed to enable her addiction for their own selfish reasons. There will forever rage debate as hindsight is perfect vision as to where blame can lie for Winehouse's untimely end. Ultimately she sought escape for a level of stardom she was never meant to attain. Some of the greatest moments of the movie are watching Amy's interaction with the great Tony Bennett who both her and her father idolized. Not only did he present her with her Grammy for Record of the Year but he also worked with her on an album of duets. He likened her voice to that of the great Ella Fitzgerald and said she was never meant for superstardom and at heart she was a great jazz singer and that is where her heart and talent and soul lie.

" What a talent
",0.4215,-0.5998,2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,I thought this was really great. I didn't realize how fast she rose to stardom and knew nothing about her eating disorder. She had a tremendous career but unfortunately ended sadly. She will truly be missed.
" there's a lot that you probably never knew about this woman
",0.0,0.9325,2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I first heard of Amy Winehouse around 2010, and it was in the context of drug and alcohol addition. When I first saw a picture of Winehouse, I thought that her beehive hairdo looked cool in an Elvira-type way. Then, Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 (another addition to the 27 club). Although I don't know Winehouse's music, Asif Kapadia's Oscar-winning ""Amy"" - consisting mostly of footage of the songstress and her acquaintances - shows that she was a complex person. She sang her heart out, and the pressures of fame got to her, leading to smear campaigns by the tabloids.I hope to hear Amy Winehouse's music in the years to come, and wonder what sort of songs she would've turned out had she survived. One can only conclude that the joys of fame and glory overwhelmed her, and it did her in. In the meantime, I recommend the documentary.Rest in peace, Amy."
" The Story Of A Girl Who Lived Fast And Died Young
",-0.5574,0.8338,2020-07-04 00:00:00,6,"This 2-hour celebrity documentary takes a close-up look at the short, but ambitious, life of popular British singer/songwriter, Amy Jade Winehouse (1983-2011).Through interviews, stills, and concert footage the viewer is given a fairly well-rounded perspective on what Amy Winehouse (and her music) was all about."
" Tears Don't Dry...
",-0.2263,0.9083,2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"I just re-watched this and was so moved that I upgraded my original 8 rating to a 10. This documentary is both uplifting in seeing her original joy in music, and heartbreaking in watching her struggles and slide towards such a tragically early death. It is so distressing to watch those who fed her demons - from her husband to her father, encouraged on by the paparazzi scum. She clearly had an addictive personality, so was hard to help. So we have this tragedy, the loss of an amazing songbird way too young. I warn you that you will be likely to spend half the duration in tears, watching the car-crash of her life as her fame increased.The documentary relies on spoken word from friends, colleagues and family to accompany video footage and still photography. I like that Asif Kapadia included contributions from those who could be perceived to have let her down, or had their own interests at heart. Whether you believe those perspectives is up to you.Favourite moment: her duet with Tony Bennett. You can see the awe in her eyes, recording with an idol of hers.Context: I am a huge Amy fan, one of the few 'modern' artists (post-1990) that I actively like, so yes I am a biased viewer. However this is essential watching for fans and non-fans alike to see the dark side of fame."
" Powerful film, difficult to watch
",0.0772,0.9678,2020-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Amy Winehouse was born to a Jewish family in 1983 and raised in the Southgate area of London. She was graced with a powerful depth of spirit that expressed itself through her versant ability to channel her unique incarnation of the great female legends of jazz, R & B, and soul. In time she became a stunning singer-songwriter in her own right. Whenever I hear her sing, it is soul-wrenching.Amy won multiple awards, including Most Grammy Awards won by a British Female Act in 2009. She mesmerized fans and other musicians alike with her soulful musical gift, rawness, humor, and vulnerability; the great singer Tony Bennett called her a great jazz singer that ""knew how to sing jazz the right way."" Bennett and Winehouse teamed up for a single ""Body and Soul"" from Tony's 2011 album Duets II. Their collaboration in the film is one of the highlights of the movie for me.This documentary was a bit of a jangled, jazzy arrangement itself; her story is shared in large part in Amy's own words through video, interviews, phonecalls, songs, and journals that move the audience through her life with her, leaving us to make sense of her short, bright, tormented life.We meet devoted childhood friends, and are introduced to a rebellious, wise, creative teen Amy, endowed with a musically mature voice and a desire to live uncaged, in her own way.The film gets increasingly more difficult to watch as relationships with her ex-husband and father, and a gaggle of eating disorders and drugs gain a stranglehold on her emotions and a sassy spirit that could have soared. Amy, it seems, was hit by the unrelenting grip fame had on her life, a downfall into heroin and other substance abuse issues, along with the persistent pressure from the fame machine. She got lost under the harsh glare of celebrity worship, a non-compassionate public, and betrayals by men she once loved who either tossed her aside, (her ex), or fell short in the department of support, (her father). Her father was not supportive of this film; it does not portray him overall in a positive light.The increasing addiction to alchohol left Amy's girlhood girlfriends gasping that they missed their old friend. Before her death at twenty-seven, one friend jubulantly shares how they finally got the old Amy back, but this was not to last.Amy's singing soars.
Her wit is a hit.
Her downslide, devastating.
The loss immense.
It was a tough film to watch."
" So sad story
",-0.5256,-0.9024,2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Yesterday, me and my lady watched this documentary. Amy was such a wounded girl, emotionally weak, which should never be blamed, but requires understanding.The more emotionally dependent a person is, the more they are subject to ""demons"" that inevitably lead to a much premature death. And then completely wrong people in ""intimate"" proximity.In a flood of cheap music, Amy Winehouse's legacy sounds old, but timeless. In her case, the phrase ""old soul in a young body"" takes on real meaning."
" Who Killed Amy?
",-0.6705,0.8131,2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,"If you want your heart smashed into a thousand pieces watch AMY - if you're a film buff that expects high production values that's not what is intended here, it's the vast collation of archival footage to give us a glimpse into the time bomb that becomes an addicts life.Unknowingly the contributors to this film have saved many untold lives from a similar fate, there is nothing like the cult of celebrity to send a moral message to the world. I've spoken with Amy's best friend Jules Ashby to give her a testimony of at least one live touched by the way she brought the story to a climax and what more could we all ask for from story telling. Just magical.While it may not have been the intention of Mitch Winehouse to hurt his daughter he clearly in the post mortem of interviews has no concept of what an absentee father does to a tween. It doesn't take a clever edit to observe that he created his own revenue stream from his daughter later in life which many other celeb fathers have done....this would have been ok if he was present before, not just after. Her behavior and choice of men as an adult is reflective of the insecurities she developed as a child. Combine this with wealth and fame and you have a perfect storm in waiting.The score in the style of the Senna documentary heightens emotions perfectly and create an experience that will linger in your soul for a long time.Amy was gifted with genre specific genius and a unique contemporary sound. When her own pain was added to musical notation she spawned believers and sympathizers across the world that would come to worship the singer regardless of how flawed and marked for death she was.We killed Amy."
" Great tragedy
",-0.0772,-0.9188,2020-05-06 00:00:00,10,"The material is picky. The order is well cut. The music is well matched. It vividly showed the essence of the tragedy making ""Let you fall in love with this person first, and then kill the beautiful blunt knife to kill you in front of you"" Amazing talents need to be equipped with extraordinary minds, otherwise they will be swallowed by the evil around them. The biggest feeling after reading is: distressed. Too distressed. When I saw Amy on the stage at a loss, or did not want to sing anymore, it was very painful."
" Seen it all b4
",0.0,0.1531,2020-04-21 00:00:00,2,I stopped watching after 20 mins It felt like seeing Doors all over again..
" Not what I was expecting
",0.0,-0.9948,2019-12-21 00:00:00,8,"I was never interested in Amy's story, but I thought I'd check it out on Netflix. This story is tragic, so so tragic, and it makes me sad that this happened in the 2000's. She didn't make one good choice from the age of 15, and she was so vulnerable and just seemed to be exploited at every turn. She was a damaged child, so can she really be made to be held fully accountable for the poor choices.What I got from this film was that she was a child with a pretty extraordinary talent, with quite low self esteem, no support, who was screaming for help most of her life. She had a drinking problem before her career started and smoked weedI was really surprised to find it was the drinking that killed her. I think she drank herself to death on purpose to just escape.Her dad and ex Blake shouldn't be entitled to a cent of her money. Her dad is just disgusting, she says she doesn't want fame and he chases her around d with film crews. And Blake, who she didn't touch hard drugs until she married him....why is he still not in jail? It makes a very clear point that he was on another level to her, and she just wanted to be on his level. Her relationship with him was so unhealthy.
And her manager Ray, when confronted by her childhood friends about her drug problems, says that heroin is almost normal and that everyone does itMaybe if someone had really stepped in, told her no, she would've had a bit of self esteem and some desire to live. You don't accidentally drink yourself to death knowing full well drinking could literally stop your heart from beating.To me, this is a Judy garland story. I honestly hope to never see this type of mistreatment again"
" Intimate, Heartbreaking And Brilliant.
",0.2023,0.4472,2019-08-05 00:00:00,9,"An outstanding account of Amy Winehouse's rise and fall, allowing us to draw our own conclusions about the complicity we all share - even watching such a film - in the public implosion of a life. Some of the footage in the last 45 minutes or so is so intimate and heartbreaking that we're tempted to think it's acting."

" a hepcat led up the garden path by a hophead
",0.0,-0.7397,2019-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Not really this reviewer's druthers to watch a real-life self-destructive personage's downfall, but Asif Kapadia's Oscar winning documentary about the late English singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse (1983-2011) proves to be a real knockout with true grit.Unconventionally ditching the ho-hum format of lyrical-waxing talking heads, Kapadia and his editor Chris King assiduously concatenate chronological segments of Amy's life through hours of archive footage, live sessions and home videos, with off-screen interviewees elaborating their often wistful comments (segued by Antonio Pinto's jazzy score), and during the lion's share of Amy's vocal renditions, lyrics are inscribed on the screen, to efficaciously stress Amy's modus operandi, she only writes about what she experiences and feels, nothing is cod or manufactured, and in a way, it is this purist attitude in regard to her vocation that has an adverse effect on her mentation, bespoken by her frustration and eagerness to make a new album after her debut FRANK (2003), which might propel her into drug and alcohol abuse in pursuance of an authentic fount for her inspiration. One could hardly imagine how Tony Bennett, one of Amy's idols, could have released over 70 albums during his lengthy career if he hews to Amy's sacrosanct decree.Tellingly, as Tony Bennett, the pair collaborating a duet version of BODY AND SOUL as Amy's last studio recording, sorrowfully states near the coda ""Life teaches you really how to live it, if you live long enough"". A counterexample of Amy is the success of Adele, who is patient enough to stay completely out of the limelight during the intervening time between her albums, who seems to be unperturbed by the urgency of releasing new materials, from 19, 21 to 25, her upcoming fourth album will be at least called 30 at present point, the gap elongates, but it is a requisite for a songwriter to quietly accrue his or her experiences before the inspiration finally hits, a luxury Amy doesn't have.So, what is the whys and wherefores? Apart from her own addiction and healthy problem (a bulimia nervosa victim), Amy's undoing is collectively, and cumulatively occasioned by a cocktail of negative influences from her self-serving family, a toxic relationship, frenzy media circus and her ill-adjustment of sudden fame and the ensuing pressure (a responsibility easily shirked by the record label, it doesn't take long for them to simply see Amy as a troublemaker whom they are willing to dump than salvage). It is interesting to read about Amy's father Mitchell's vexed reaction of the movie, who is hot to trot to green-light the project (after losing his money spinner, he knows making hay while the sun still shines), but is wrong-footed by the none-too-flattering presentation of his own image, because he might surmise there is apparently a more high-profile candidate who is deplorable for Amy's perdition, her ne'er-do-well ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civl, a despicable hophead leads a hepcat up the garden path. But Kapadia conscientiously flags up Mitchell's own grasping nature in one telltale video recording, who has no patience to leave Amy in convalescence after her health is incontrovertibly impaired, to a certain extent, the last straw that pushes Amy off the deep end is his fast-tracked arrangement of her comeback in 2011, her disastrous and last public appearance in a Belgrade concert, and as the story edges near the sad coda, Amy's own voice also peters out.All in all, not eschewing the knotty and unsavory cankers that perpetuate a gone-too-soon music genius, Kapadia and co.'s effort is a rewardingly eloquent and candid elegy of Amy Winehouse's extraordinary talent and cautionary tragedy, yet, one shall not despair, we still have Adele and her music to celebrate and cherish in our mundane presence."
" Brilliant and moving
",0.5859,-0.9557,2018-10-10 00:00:00,8,"The rise and fall of the late singer Amy Winehouse are the subjects of this British documentary.The film follows a linear chronology of events and it pays off much like a fictional film. The beginning covers the early teenage years and Winehouse's interest in a musical career. This segment is steady but less exciting compared to what comes later. It serves as a build-up. Once star status and chemical abuse enter the picture, the film succeeds as a genuine and shocking heart-breaker.For those of us with minimal knowledge of Winehouse's life (though many of us probably knew of the scandals), we can look at the film as a mystery to find further clues to the final outcome that we already know. From the incredible footage (both private and public) obtained by director Asif Kapadia, we get such clues. One is a pre-fame declaration that she couldn't handle fame. Another is when superstardom has just begun as she walks past several adoring, screaming fans to receive an award. While this might be a dream come true for most, the look on her face shows that a nightmare has just begun.Kapadia has the skill of presenting facts without bias letting the viewers have their own opinions of what they see. As the presentation is so strong, so are the possible opinions. While Winehouse was partly responsible for her actions, the film shows that others took terrible advantage of her.While she expressed a need for an extended rest at different times, there was pressure by her ""team"" to push her further (and get more money from her). A sequence involving a concert in Belgrade is shocking in how she was manipulated.The worst exposure in the film is that of the media's behaviour. The shocking footage of Winehouse being stalked during personal crises is enraging as is the footage following her death. One must keep in mind that this is the same paparazzi that tormented Princess Diana to death. It seems that some members of the British paparazzi learned nothing from the Diana tragedy. They still seem hell-bent on killing their own.The most moving scene of the film is the filming of Winehouse showing insecurity during a recording of a duet with the venerable and prolific Tony Bennett (who's still working in his late 80s). Bennett responds in a way that is patient, understanding, and most of all, paternal. His genius and humanity pay off in droves. Of course, the main draw for this movie is the super-talented subject. Thankfully, many of her songs are included throughout the film. Her music and personality make ""Amy"" one of the best documentaries of the last five years and one of the best movies of 2015."
" Wow...
",0.0,0.3182,2018-08-06 00:00:00,10,This was an outstanding documentary. Clearly everyone around Amy watched her go down slowly. Such a tragedy.
" The Fame Monster
",0.4404,0.7906,2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"Listening to Amy's music, it's easy to forget just how young she was. At a time when Gwen Stefani and Kelly Clarkson were topping the charts, her voice seemed to be broadcast to us from a generation that our parents or grandparents might have recognized.
 
But Amy was just a kid before fame was thrust upon her and had its way with her. The movie begins in the year 2001, when she was just 17 and her manager, Nick Shymansky, was 19.
 
Over the next decade, we watch fame consume someone who clearly never wanted it and does not have the maturity or emotional support to cope with it.
 
Under the weight of rapidly increasing attention and expectations, early red flags of her substance abuse and eating disorders go unnoticed. By the time they become life-threatening, celebrity culture completes its cycle of creation and destruction, happy to make lazy quips about her downward spiral playing out on a public stage.Her impending and premature death loom over this entire film. About an hour in, each new scene feels like it could be the conclusion to this heartbreaking biography. In a small way, it captures the anxiety of having a loved one in recovery and never knowing when you're going to get that call.The fact that there is no happy ending to this story makes it a difficult movie to watch, but you also get immersed in what a rare personality and talent she really was. I did not realize how much I had missed her."
" Amy gives us an insight to the uncontrollable downfall of fame.
",0.1027,0.9847,2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"A biographical documentary depicting both the early personal life and musical career of Amy Winehouse, who unfortunately overdosed on drugs in 2011. Biopics are difficult to review, you have to refrain from judging the person that is being portrayed and just review the documentary itself. However, before I start I would like to say that Amy Winehouse was incredibly talented. It really was a shame what she went through in terms of her own personal demons. She was clearly infectiously likeable and down to earth, devoted to her one passion. This documentary creatively captures her fragility through the use of old recordings, montages of pictures with onscreen lyrics to accompany them and countless awards ceremonies for all the recognition she rightfully deserved. This is a statement. To explore and convey the desirable disease of fame. Fame. It can corrupt the most innocent of souls. The influx of money, power and popularity can enhance the accessibility of drugs and alcohol. In Amy's case, it destroyed her. Not solely, the film takes the time to go through her stages of early depression before she took the world by storm. It's utterly moving and powerful. A young woman susceptible to external influences. She didn't know what she was doing, it was out of her control. The way the media covered her story rather enraged me, with several chat shows and news reports mocking her. It's important to acknowledge that the media only saw one side to her, but it's a shame they reduced her to a mess. As empathetic as this is, we also celebrate her work by listening and watching her perform. Director Asif Kapadia dynamically balanced her lows and highs to portray an enigmatic young woman who was taken from us far too early. The runtime could've been slightly shorter to maintain a tighter biopic, but it's a fitting tribute and I highly recommend you watch this. Like me, you don't need to be a fan of her to appreciate the complexity and intellectual narrative of this documentary."
" Pretty sentimental!
",0.6996,0.909,2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a very emotional movie. It get you to know the real side of the Amy Winehouse's history. You'll get to know the fragile human being that was hiding behind those drugs and the alcohol. A girl that just wanted to express herself and impress the world with her beautiful and unique voice. Pretty well made, it may bring you to tears. It doesn't have anything fake in it."

" Shuts the haters up
",-0.4939,0.9289,2017-11-23 00:00:00,8,"This documentary tells the story of a beautiful talented girl that the world clearly wasn't ready for. We get to see how playful, caring, and honest Amy was. When watching this documentary no longer can her haters dismiss her as nothing more than a junky. If after this documentary they still do, then they are just idiots. The documentary helps people understand what lead her to the path of self destruction. Too many people were around her as leeches rather than playing the roles of actual friends or family members for that matter. The reason I give it an 8 is because I wish it could have explored her childhood more, I believe there's more childhood trauma than the documentary shows that helped cause her problems. Nonetheless, it did a great job at exploring Amy the person rather than the troubled celebrity."
" A portrait of Amy Winehouse as a commodity, rather than a woman.
",0.0,0.8674,2017-07-20 00:00:00,7,"In 2012, a year after her death, Asif Kapadia was approached to make a 'warts and all' documentary about Amy Winehouse. The commission came from the label that owns the artist's back catalogue – Universal Music UK – whose CEO is an executive producer on the film. 'Amy' is now out on general release and has been critically acclaimed as a gritty and truthful portrait of the star.It's hard not to be moved by the film since it documents the rise and fall of a charismatic artist who is eminently watchable – and she is rarely off screen. The film is constructed around a chronological collage, starting with home videos and phone footage shot by family, friends and her first manager, Nick Shymansky, before she was famous.Mischievous, outspoken, funny, subversive and shy, she is recognisably 'Amy' in these early glimpses. But the apparent intimacy this lends the documentary is partly illusory since she is performing even then – as we all do in front of a camera. Little by little these informal shots give way to promotional interviews, concert footage before bigger and bigger audiences, and the scenes of her very public decline.Kapadia's interviews with her family, colleagues and friends are relegated to the sound track of this compelling montage. The technique does away with tedious 'talking heads' but at a price. Unable to see expressions or body language we lose any nuance – both in the self-justifications of her husband, father and tour manager and in the moving testimony of her two closest friends, the most 'reliable witnesses' in the film.What we are left with, then, is a montage of an 'Amy' knowingly on display but the notion that this is the 'real' Amy is reinforced rather than challenged by the perspectives of those who actually knew her. And the tale of the Amy on display is a familiar and abidingly popular one, as is evident by the clichés recycled in the rave reviews of the film: she is 'fragile', 'troubled', a moth drawn to a flame, a comet which burned bright and fell from the sky.At some point in the middle of the film it is casually revealed that Amy Winehouse suffered from Bulimia – an eating disorder which afflicts around 4% of the UK population and 5% of college- age women in the USA. Eating disorders are on the rise across the world and nine out of ten sufferers are women, driven into a destructive conflict with their own bodies by the desire to match the pre-pubescent figures beloved of the fashion industry. In the US three quarters of female alcoholics under the age of 30 also have eating disorders. The 20% who receive no help will die – like Karen Carpenter who starved herself to death at the age of 33. Seen in this context Amy Winehouse's 'story' is not so rock and roll after all; nor is it, sadly, unusual.What was unusual was her considerable talent and her reluctance to play the air-brushed celebrity game despite being in the public eye – where she was duly objectified, commodified, hounded and ultimately mocked. Her ruthless pursuit by the media is powerfully conveyed in the film, as is the gleeful jeering of 'personalities' like Graham Norton and Jay Leno. But here 'Amy' has its cake and eats it too: the film recycles intrusive images of her ravaged body and tormented face for us all to enjoy, indulging our morbid fascination from the moral high-ground of retrospective disapproval.These are the 'warts' that are offered up in this documentary, sanctioned as it is by Universal. The 'star is born' script of the female artist, heartbroken, led astray, too fragile to cope with the demands of fame – a cautionary tale familiar to us all and therefore easy to package and sell. We are even treated to footage of her corpse being carried out of her house on a stretcher, presumably in case we didn't realise she is dead.As a portrait of the public commodity Amy Winehouse, a sharp lyricist and musician with a great jazz voice, the film certainly delivers. How could it not? But there is a presumption of intimacy in the title which the film simply doesn't deliver. The most moving bit, for me, was the footage of her notorious last concert in Belgrade. Pushed to tour when she didn't want to, shoved into the spotlight when she should have been in hospital, she comes on stage and, for the first few minutes at least, resists the pressure to be 'Amy' and refuses to sing"
" I Only Watched the Trailer, Not the Film
",0.0,-0.7169,2017-06-02 00:00:00,1,"After seeing this film's trailer, I knew that Amy's death was a way for enough people to not mind their own business after the hell that she went through. This film is another reason why Amy probably had things about her be released without her full consent. Her father, drugs, husband, fame, and divorce all gave her negative influences. I know those things from trying to find information on her discography on Wikipedia. But, there needs to be a film to regurgitate those facts out? I think not."
" The downfall of a talent
",0.4215,0.9697,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Interesting music biography about Amy Winehouse. Even if it's not your kind of music her story is worth to be told and filmed. It's not my kind of music, besides a couple numbers that I like, but the documentary is captivating. Seeing how a talented young woman destroys her life with alcohol and drugs could be an example for the next generation. An example on how not to go on that path. The turning point in her life was falling in love with Blake Fielder. He's just the kinda guy a girl like Amy should never have met. With her tendencies of addiction falling in love with a druggie like him could only mean her downfall. She might look strong at some points but she's obviously also very vulnerable. Her dedication to her husband and her father were not the smartest moves in her short life. Would she still be alive without meeting him? We will never know. Amy is full of unseen footage from her childhood till her dead and for fans a must see. But even for people like me it's certainly worth a watch."

",0.7906,0.9934,2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The documentary is about the great jazz- slash pop singer Amy Winehouse, how she lived her life, her passion for her music, and at the end, at the age 27 sadly died from her many years of bulimia, drug and alcohol abuse.I personally think that the documentary is a great idea, to give an insight of what the great British singer struggled with on and of the stage. No life is perfect, but that may be an underestimation for Amy's life. The only thing that brought pure happiness and joy to the life she lived, was when she wrote her songs, played her music and were with the love of her life, Blake. It's definitely a very strong telling and got my mind start questioning some things, but also cleared some things I have been asking myself earlier before I watched the documentary. For example is her lyrics more understandable to me now. I know now that ""stronger than me"" is about her older boyfriend who became the woman in their relationship as the time went by, ""back to black"" is Amys relationship to Blake before he left his former girlfriend, where he played ping-pong between these two relationships, but particularly her prizewinning hit ""rehab"" have crossed my mind many times, but now I understand the lyric perfectly. I have often wondered why her dad was mentioned, that she didn't wanted to go to rehab, and her dad agreed that it wasn't necessary. I never understood that part, but now I know this was the reality. Amys father had her unconditionally love, and that was a priceless power to give the man, who abandoned his family when Amy was about seven or ten years old. I'm torn between what I think about how the documentary is put together. I like the idea that it's videotapes from her whole life that have been put together, and then having the people who meant something in her life talking in the meanwhile, but then again it's just a shame that the quality is really shitty, because of a lot of shaking hands holding the cameras. But when that have been said I think it's an extremely teach-full documentary that I probably will look back at when I see or hear about another famous person who is being followed and getting a hard time from the journalists and his/hers fans."
" The documentary sums up the life of the famous jazz-singer Amy Winehouse and her hardships along the way.
",0.0,-0.7914,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"I think that the documentary ""AMY"" is a really nice backstory of how the famous jazz-singer became famous, and how as a person she just wanted to sing jazz in small bars and ended up as one of the most iconic jazz symbol in the world and her death right after. It also tells about the singers life complications and hardships along her lifetime, it tells about her family problems and relationship problems. Its a really nice look on how a famous singer deals with her lifes famosity. her death right after."
" Really good
",0.4927,0.8059,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"It's a very good documentary, it really shows how Amy went through her life. It's also a little bit hard to watch her perform on a stage when you know what she have been through. After watching this I realized what her songs a really about, and it also surprised me that she survived so long on drugs and alcohol."
" A documentary of Amy Winehouse's life. We follow her trough her life. Both bad and good days.
",-0.1531,0.93,2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"The documentary is great. It's terrifying but also exciting. You follow her trough her career and her life. The documentary expose it all both bad things and good things. The scenes are real and recorded at the time. That makes it good and credible. It shows the proof of Amy's life, and we see the truth off being a popular artist. The documentary is good because you really see how it is and nothing is hidden. It's not always about money and popularity. It's also about what the person want and how far Amy would like to go. She is getting in a lot of trouble and that leads to her dead in the end. She couldn't handle it anymore and that is terrifying to see. Overall it's a tough but amazing documentary."
" Nicolai's Review
",0.0,0.757,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"All in all it was not the worst movie/Documentary I have seen about Amy Whinehouse, or any other singer for that matter. It had a very slow beginning but when you pass the 2005 mark it really picks up not only in her career but also in her personal life with her meeting her boyfriend Blake who had a history with harder drugs than what Amy already was familiar with. In the end we all know what happened to her but this documentary does a really good job at explaining the background of the incidents."
" In this documentary, we follow Amy Winehouse through her journey towards becoming a highly admired and world known artist.
",0.5563,0.9632,2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"In this documentary, we follow Amy Winehouse through her journey towards becoming a highly admired and world known artist. We get a look inside her mind, and an insight in how she felt and acted when she was alone or with friends, with no cameras rolling. We see how her music was her savior, but also her destruction. She wasn't meant for a life like a celebrity, and a dangerous combination of her becoming so, and getting into a very stormy relationship ended up with her dead by a heart attack caused by a serious abuse of alcohol and drugs.I find that this documentary is heartbreaking and dark, but in a good way. It truly describes Amy's life for better or for worse. I have never been a big fan of Amy, and the only thing I ever remember hearing about her was from my mom when I was little. She was quite upset on the day of her death, and wouldn't stop talking about what a shame it was. Back then I didn't really put a lot of thought into it, but while watching this movie I truly understood how sad a story it actually is. She sure had an outstanding talent, but she was just never meant to be famous. She struggled a lot with her mind, and yet her managers - and even her own dad - kept her in the spotlight at all times. In the beginning her music was her savior when she went through a rough time. It helped her get over heartbreaks, and process her thoughts and feelings. And what a shame it is that something that beautiful and peaceful must be consumed by fame, paparazzi's and the media. I must admit that with the pressure she was under twenty-four-seven it doesn't surprise me that she reached a point where she couldn't take it anymore. She was a fragile and misunderstood human, but the surrounding world didn't take this into consideration. What makes this documentary so outstanding and probably one of the best I have seen is, that it hasn't been made to entertain. It has been made to tell a story, and because it is so raw, it gets truly sincere. It's an honorable attempt at showing her meaningful lyrics, and great successes, but at the same time the self-harming and declines from where it all first started."

Amy is drug and alcohol addicted, Amy died at the end because of overdose. My opinion to the movie: i think it's a boring documentary, but also a very eye opening documentary."
" Like a fictitious doomed celebrity story, except with real people
",-0.4019,0.9838,2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I was initially daunted by the 120 minute running time of this film, but I was glued from beginning to end and felt as if I had been watching it for about half that time. I have never seen anything like this before. It was like watching Breaking Glass with Hazel O'Connor or Stardust with David Essex, but they were fictitious stories acted out for entertainment, and this was real people with a real star and yet such a familiar rags-to-riches story with a tragic ending. And because the story is the stuff of 'rock star' urban legends, you think that someone is going to step in to prevent the inevitable, and yet that never happens.I say that the people in this film are real, but that is not entirely the case, because it has been skillfully edited to present villains and good guys: those who are motivated by money, fame or drugs; and those, like Amy herself, who are driven by love. I don't think that you are supposed to believe these caricatures, this is just the film-maker's view of Amy's story, and I am sure that every single person involved would tell a different tale from the one we are presented with in this film. And for me, that is what makes it extraordinary, because although it is a documentary that presents a gripping true story played out by real people in real life, it is predominantly an art-form giving one person's perspective just like a novel or a painting does.I would just like to add that I am an Iron Maiden fan who has never listened to Amy Winehouse in my life. She had a amazing voice, but her style was not to my taste. That does not in any way detract from the brilliance of the film or, indeed, Amy herself."
" It's a decent film, with a sad ending
",-0.4767,0.4019,2017-03-16 00:00:00,4,"The film is obviously about Amy Winehouse, who has a tough life with ups, but many downs. She's a great singer and gets a lot of recognition for it. But she gets into drugs and alcohol because of Blake and actually gets addicted. She sadly ends up dying because her body couldn't take it anymore."

But it has some known. It's crazy how famous, can seriously have it. Can get it really badly about that they wanted to be like quite normal people."

" Heartbreaking beyond words
",-0.4588,0.8484,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I have known my share of addicts. Even though Amy was famous, she was no different than any other addicts. I am glad the film makers showed her as not just an out of control addict. She knew what she was which is what makes it even more heartbreaking. She was a kind, beautiful lost soul. May she RIP and find the peace she could not find on this Earth."
