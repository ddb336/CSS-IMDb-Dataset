Chanchal outperformed himself with his exceptional acting. And reminded us why he is the best leading actor/hero in Bangladesh right now.
And Cinematography is good. It stands out from the garbage films that run on theater now.Besides these plus points, there's no plot in the movie. This movie could be told in a 15 minutes short film.

" Best Bangladeshi Movie
",0.6369,0.9939,2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Amitabh Raza: He is one of the finest maker in Bangladesh. Previously he made so many excellent TV dramas and commercials, so when I heard that he's coming into the big screen and making his debut film, I was so thrilled and excited. Besides that, Rashed Zaman, the cinematographer (whom I call Bangladesh's Emmanuel Lubezki) was the other captivating element of this film which entices me even more. Today, I went to see the film which was the very first day of it's release and came back home with wide wonderment and joy.The lead actor, Chanchal Chowdhury is one of the brightest actor in this generation. Before, he was so good in Monpura (2009) and Television (2013). And now in Aynabaji he simply enchanted and stole the whole show single handedly. I can guarantee, he will win The National Award for sure. The story line was so unique and had so much depth, which allows Chanchal to make it more blazed. Chanchal is a sheer virtuoso of acting and this is obviously his best work so far.Not only Chanchal, the others actors, actress also put up a good show. Lutfur Rahman George, Partho Barua acted very well. Masuma Rahman Nabila was surprisingly good. There were some teeny tiny irrationality with the story line, but they are absolutely negligible, because if you want to compare with Bangladeshi Standard, Aynabaji was exceptionally good. In camera work, in sound editing and mixing, in casting ensemble, in costume, the whole film so skillfully mastered. The songs are pretty good, the script has so many punches and humors.Hats off to the whole team. This movie is highly recommended for all, to the general viewer and also for the other people who kind of love to see different tracks of movies."

" Aynabaji
",0.0,0.9801,2020-09-16 00:00:00,10,"This is an extraordinary film and one of the best outstanding making of Bengali film industry is ""Aynabaji"". Especially not at all like with customary Bengali motion pictures that are delivered in both Bangladesh and India.
The primary job is ""Sharafat Karim Ayna"", which is portrayed by Chanchal Chowdhury, has a few kinds of by-borne heavenly quality to duplicate any one's conduct. He likewise can enter anybody's mind and can coordinate the individuals around him. He goes to the jail keeping the genuine criminal outside by the trading of cash and anybody can't remember him. All through this film ""Ayna"" enters to the jail rather than a few hoodlums in various occasions. In any case, finally he gets caught as the criminal rather than whom Ayna comes to jail, is charged for capital punishment. Furthermore, through this the story goes on. Each character in the film has had the option to set up an otherworldly relationship with the crowd. present them in a genuine manner with no sort of misrepresentation with the crowd. The class character depicted sincerely has the privilege to introduce positions and connections.
The film is striking for its extraordinary storyline. Such a character like Ayna is so hard to be described. The chief was essentially fruitful. Cinematography was great. In spite of the fact that it contains a few quantities of imperfections all through. It was the principal Movie for the chief yet he put forth a valiant effort. A few anomalies can be seen, however for a low spending film a few defects are extremely hard to eliminate Overall, thanx to all the cast, teams and everybody. Expectation all the imperfections can be eliminated and we will get ""Aynabji-2"" or its spin-off. Absolute best of karma to the Aynabaji group
Melodic course of action was so sensitive and genuinely pulled in. The uniqueness of aesthetic method of workmanship heading thus far each and every shot incites each crowd to fixed in their seat. Cinematographer Rashed Zaman has made a colossal showing for giving his value of information on involvement with each and every shot to made screenplay as though live creative mind. Plus, customary Bengali film impression it is somewhat very unique for its narrating cycle according to 'dull parody' pictures can be found in the Screen. Basically, different sides of the coin of life contrasted with a trade of mirror impression of the biography are Ayanabaji.
This film truly gives us how men with riches and high influence drives their life in this adulterated society, It flawlessly brought up a clouded side of Bangladesh which was entrancing to investigate all through the entire film! Genuinely grand.
Incredible work by Amitabh Reza Chowdhury, the overseer of this film. Projecting team were likewise incredible in their particular jobs.
The sound-light-time frame game has expanded masterful estimation of film crowds' advantage and fascination. Shot congruity ready to appropriately introduce the arrangement of occasions as his metropolitan structure makes a special figment.
An unquestionable requirement watch film for everybody. This film will merit your cash and time."

" A Perfect Crime Thriller in Bengali Language
",0.1531,0.9983,2020-07-13 00:00:00,10,"I watched Aynabazi Movie at the Star Cineplex, Dhaka back in 2016. It was the first ever crime thriller movie that I watched in a theater. Later I watched again on TV but didnt get the same flavour like the theatrical experience. I could have been written a long write-up on it, but decide not to give any clearcut spoilers.I always believe that the core competencies of a person could lead him/her to survive in this cruel world. So, we need to nurture our competencies whatever our situation would be.Sharafat Karim Ayna (Chanchal Chowdhury) is a person who lives in a small room of an old and shrivelled house in Old Dhaka. He runs a small acting school of children. He aspired to become an actor but the fate decides otherwise. He possesses an enormous skill of METHOD ACTING and in this skill he could morph into any character. Ayna converts himself fully on that particular character as if he is that person in real. He befriends with Hridi (Nabila) who develops soft corner by seeing Ayna's struggling, impoverish life but a kind hearted contribution to the children. Hridi is a kind hearted girl who lives with her father and a house assistant (Akter Hossain). However, Ayna's enormous skill has been recurrently used by the corrupted people of the city to woo laws and people's eye and Ayna, to survive himself in this ruthless city, sacrifices his ethics of being a good man. Crime reporter Saber (Partha Barua) follows Ayna for a long time to reveal the linkage between him and the dark world of the city.The acting of Chanchal was unparallel. After tremendous success in Monpura (2009), he escalates his standard of acting in a new echelon. If he was performed this Aynabazi performance at any Hollywood movie, he would be flooded by accolades, praises and awards from all over the world. Feeling sad that he is a Bangladeshi actor where he would never get such platform to unleash his true potential. I also praised the performance of Partha Barua, who is a renowned singer of Bangladesh. Though a small screen timing, Nabila performed very well.The same things of being a small movie industry person, story writer Gousul Alam and the director Amitabh Reza Chowdhury could get more attention if they were in Hollywood. As a crime thriller fan, I expect more stories from Gousul Alam like this. Amitabh Reza is a renowned media person who extends his talent by directing this movie which was his directorial debut.Music of this film was memorable. Personally I like the song ""Dhire Dhire Jao Na Shomoy"" by Habib Wahid and Anweshaa. The particular scene of this song, where Nabila stands in the rooftop of a building facing the river buriganga was scintillating. That snap was instantly viral amongst all Bangladeshi people. I have searched on that building and found that building is a private property and not for taking a Personal Photography there.Aynabazi receives 7 awards at the Bangladesh National Film Awards 2016 which are: Best Director, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound Recording and Best Costume Design"

This kind of things does and can happen in this country with all the bloody politicians.The cinematography is one of the best, the drone shots to show the beautiful Dhaka city in wide shots were perfectly captured. I could watch those shots for hours and we did have many long shots of characters riding bikes, cars.Chanchal Chowdhury steals the movie with his acting range. He perfectly embodied the other characters roles and was believable.
Nabila's romantic subplot wasn't just another cliche romantic plot but it served Ayna's arc of leaving the dirty job. Partha Barua was a plot progresser and we do go to his POV time to time. Non of the other side characters were bad, they made the film to have more of a realitic-setting.The songs, thank god there wasn't any male-female dance party music. Every single music was good and still time to time I play 'Lag belki lag,Aynabaji'. The heart felt romantic music and Jail song was also well done.The story is can divided to a 3 part story but the screenwriter uses it for advantage and tells 3 jail stories with slowly romantic subplot brewing in the back.One of the best if not the best Bangladeshi film of this generation."

" Aynabaji : Pure Bangladeshi Story with Fabulous Cinematography
",0.5267,0.9118,2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"One of the good movies of recent times. I like the uniqueness of the plot. Probably this is the first Bangladeshi movie that tries drama and suspense genre with pure Bangladeshi urban flavor. It's mesmerizing to see familiar locations like Paribag, Puran Dhaka, Sadar Ghat etc with subliminal frames. Chanchal Chowdhury again showed why he was awarded National Film Awards back in 2009."

" Utterly splendid
",0.624,0.91,2018-11-08 00:00:00,9,The concept was pretty good I would have given it 10 the only department it lacks at is the casting.The supporting cast ain't that good and the heroine looks like she has been burdened with a herculean task.She is the epitome of how a perfect movie can be ruined because of bad casting.

" Aynabaji Best Movie Ever in Bangladesh
",0.6369,0.9612,2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"A great combination of story and direction nice cinematography. Promising acting overall a great work. Amithab reza a new director from Bangladesh who just showed that it possible to do a better work if you give such effort.All the actors justifies their roles in the film.Specially Chanchal Chowdhury does an extraordinary acting in the movie . His transformation from one role to another is just too good in the movie .His role ""Ayna"" is one of the unique characters in the Bangladeshi movie history ."
" Over-rated one
",0.0,0.3464,2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"It is certainly one of the most over-rated movie I have ever seen. I am not saying, Aynabaji is a bad movie. Obviously, it a good movie. Overall It's a very entertaining movie. I liked it. The direction, acting and cinematography was exceptionally good. But does this movie really deserves such high rating? 9.4!? Probably some guys are not taking this rating seriously. They are too much biased or hyped. This movie simply doesn't deserves such high rating."
" Right path for Bangladeshi movie
",0.0,0.9661,2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"this will be short. no spoilers-The movie was a great one because of the skillful direction of Mr. Amitabh Reza Chowdhury and crafty performances of Chanchal Chowdhury, Masuma Rahman Nabila who inspired the audience to be connected to every plot in the story line of Mr. Ayna( Chanchal Chowdhury).I loved the story of Ayna, his humor, his motive, his pains and love.The movie didn't have any typical Dhaka-ish movie glamour/ hero-heroin saga . Rather it seemed so realistic and charismatic.I hope the producers will invest more for this type of movies and inspire the writers to write good stories for movies and help to uplift the skills of our countries' directors and actors."
