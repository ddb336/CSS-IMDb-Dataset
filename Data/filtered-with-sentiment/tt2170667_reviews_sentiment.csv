" An experience that stays with You!
",0.0,0.7947,2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,"What a ride! This movie got so many aspects of depression on the right levels; Drugs, addiction, music, character's sense of the world, absence of outsiders and them having no influence on the character's will to live, character's guilt, lack of trust, him living in the past and so on. It's rare to find this perfect blend in movies, they always miss something or twist the story which doesn't fit viewer's experience but this movie got it all. The ending was so pure and original nothing less than the Andy's escape from Shawshank. Vibes of Boyhood (2014) mixed with determination portrayed in Gattaca (1997) and inflicts you with awe just as in Oldboy (2006)."
" As good as the rating suggests. A definite must watch.
",0.6124,0.9198,2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"The review from taniqeb ""A film not to walk away from"" is about a good a review as you will get. Accurate and honest. So I won't add more, other than to say this is a great film that really hits the spot, a film I will won't forget. Ignore the negative reviews here, this is an excellent film from start to finish."
" A film not to walk away from
",0.0,0.8369,2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"This is the kind of film that doesn't pretend to explain itself; the kind of film you can't start watching halfway and expect to find a resolution. It's the kind of film that requires you to remain seated, be still - and focus on what's really in front of you.The premise of a paraplegic trying to end his life sets a dark yet humorous tone, but this quickly evolves into a sort of belated coming-of-age story. Add into the mix, a wheelchair-bound street junkie, poverty, prostitution and drugs - and you have the making of a needling and all-to-often relatable reality.This story, given its almost two-hour length, doesn't dawdle and distract you with sub-plots. It is decisive and the story-telling is raw whilst remaining sensitive to the themes it explores. For those who are cast aside, life is seldom a thing of beauty or purpose.If we can forgive a few sudden character swings, we are still left with an engaging and empathic representation of what going down the deep and dark rabbit hole truly looks like."
" This is a Rating Scam !! Dont watch it !!
",-0.7067,0.7964,2020-10-10 00:00:00,1,"I was pretty astounded that such a unknown film had such high rating. After checking the 10/10 reviewers and the things that they have reviewed, its clear those reviewers are just paid to fake reviews. Some of them had only reviewed this one film, & some of them have rated the same films similarly, probably they were paid for those. Steer clear of this one."

It is a good film overall, but it does not deserve a high rating. I do not think it is unique and the dramatic construction was not as it should be"
" Average movie (some minor spoilers)
",0.0,-0.8027,2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Firstly, when you see so many 10's, then your B.S. antenna should be up, this movie is a 6 or 6 1/2 at best. I will say this, Patrick Hume as ""Drake"" was great in it, that guy's got a future for sure. One can understand where the writer was trying to take this, trying to show how sometimes the despair of being a paraplegic, the self recrimination, the sense of hopelessness etc, can lead people to try and escape their reality through drug use and even suicide. Some of the scenes of drug use, attempted suicide and the violence made me cringe, I'll admit, it's not for someone with a weak stomach. Despite some good potential in this story, some of the plot lines were just not believable. Even if our two protagonists engaged in hold ups (laugh at that idea if you will) or faking injuries to scam money out of strangers to buy drugs, how long could they do it before the police arrived and arrested them? Are they going to try and outrun the police in their wheelchairs? No wonder you never see a cop in sight. Their are a lot of flashbacks in this movie, hinting at the cause of Donavon's paralysis, but the denouement, the final unraveling and explanation of it at the end of the movie, is just not credible. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice to say, it beggars belief. It is an interesting movie, quite unlike any I've seen before, but ultimately, it's let down by some mediocre acting (with the exception of Patrick Hume) and some glaring plot holes."

" I couldn't sleep the first night I watched this film
",0.0,-0.077,2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie definitely will leave you thinking about deeper things in your personal life if you have any heart at all. It's so heartbreaking to watch these two characters set their lives (literally) on fire. That being said the pain and heartbreak that comes along on their journey is flipped on its head by the dark comedy between these two characters.
I also loved the little details in this film on the second watch, there is a lot to be said for the whole being born and death metaphors in the movie, revolving around water. Like when Mickey tries to kill himself for the first time, he is in a bathroom, which comes back later. When he seeks out his brother replacement, who ends up being replaced by Drake. You can see in the opening credits that the little brother is pushing him to do stuff, that he doesn't want to do.
And let's not stop at the music and the score. Really a great little film. I loved it!"
" Worthless

" i dont know what to believe....
",0.0,0.4081,2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,"Because it has got some weird contradictions spread out all over the film. is it the story of a deathseeker? is it the true story about a life in a wheelchair? is the main really a paraplegic or is it just katatonic psychosis due to horrible situations in his childhood? there are so many unanswered questions and flashbacks of memories in this drama that starts with a handful of more or less functional suicide attempts, as far as you can go when bound to a wheelchair. the lust of selfkill fades a bit when he bumps into a wheelchair bum, that gives no praise to the lord in hheaven, and creates havock whereever he goes. add on alcohol and speedballing and armed robberies, and youll have to wear your speedoes to escape the four wheeled doubleheaded pullengine on the looseits a hard film to watch if your on drugs, are depressed or simply are a wheelchair user. why? well its got some realism to it that ive never seen before, so watch out.its a very good film till it reaches far to deep, its like a smoldering fire that may flame or not. the 2 main actors are over the benchmark of acting capabilities, and the filmo, edit and musical score are so well knit together , so it is a kind of must see film. the grumpy old man whos capabel of handling a wheelchair do recommend."
" For Shame
",-0.4767,0.9828,2020-02-20 00:00:00,5,"For shame these guys have tried to scam film rating sites and make it the self professed best film ever made, because there is some talent and half decent film-making in there. I sort of enjoyed it; it was inventive and moved along nicely. The message was a touch trite and there were way too many cliches and things borrowed from better films to make it a film I would honestly recommend. The best I can say for it is that it looked great and was pretty professionally put together, including some of the acting. However, this is a 5 or 6 out of ten film all day long. I hope they get the cash for another project and this time let it be judged fairly, like every other film out there. Saying that, it kinda worked, cos I might not have watched this for any other reason than the false rating."

" Lame and a bit offensive
",-0.7003,0.6597,2019-05-26 00:00:00,6,"My first review on imdb. Why for this particular movie? Because after watching it with my nephew, who is disabled, like myself, we were both very disappointed and a tad offended.When the main protagonist meets Drake, the movie is fun and wild. Drugs, guns, girls.
We get some flashbacks that are a part of the final ""twist"", which is some psychological BS. Which is fine, except whoever wrote this probably never heard of muscular atrophy.
Even this aside, the ending is kinda selfish on the part of the main character.8 for the first part and Drake, whose story and motives were better suited as the base of the movie.3 for the ending and surprise revelation."

" Compelling and unexpected in it is brilliance
",0.7003,0.9168,2018-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Wheels is a character-driven low budget movie whose protagonist is going through his own emotional turmoil in the fact that he has no friends are family in his life. Mickey reaches out to Drake, a homeless junkie, in the hopes of suicide by proxy. The two become friends and go adventures to acquire heroin, prostitutes and other narcotics, in an attempt to not face their dark pasts.Tim Gagliardo and Donavon Warren execute this dark drama with the most delicate of touches. The cinematography is both stunning and breathtaking while not taking away from the characters emotional consequences of their actions and the story. Donavon Warren's acting performance as Mickey is both gut-wrenching and empathetic. While Patrick Hums portrayal of Drake shows a demonized man who is seeking redemption.Wheels is both compelling and unexpected in it is brilliance."
" I HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THIS FILM
",-0.1779,0.9937,2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Directed by Tim Gagliardo and Donavon Warren(who also wrote and stared), Wheels is a movie about two people trying to find peace and resolve in the world that we live in today. I am not going to go into detail about the story in depth. I think it's more important the feeling I walked away with from this film. This really is an amazing film and has so many levels every time I watch it. I have become a little obsessed for reasons 100% sure of but I will try to illustrate here.1. The story really affects you. As many times as you try to not get invested, you reach a point where there is no turning back. The story is Very humorous at times with superb dark humor. The film pushes you off balance, then the more emotional elements seep in, like a sinking ship, you really don't want it to go down, but you know it will eventually plunge into the sea.2. The characters as some of the strongest characters I have ever viewed on film. You have two characters that are so rock solid strong, in the fact that they would be some of the strongest characters on film even if they were not paralyzed.3. Everything is done well. Especially finding out that this film was made for nothing. The value of the film is equal to higher budget films4. The acting is top notch. I have never heard of any of these people in this film, but I was blown away. Especially Patrick Hume's performance as Drake. I feel had this film gotten a proper studio to make it, he would have won all the Awards.5. The score and music are phenomenal. I don't know where this music came from, it's this underground rock, I don't even know. It's really great. The score is equally matched.The only bad things I could say if any would be that this film gets dark at the end, but to me, I am into that tone and wish more films didn't shy away from the harsh realities of the world. This movie takes you to places others dare not go. Bravo!"

I am not into these sorts of low budget art movies, but this movie really got to me. I got sucked in and then was rooting for these guys. I just couldn't help but care for them both. I don't know what it is.
I don't cry often once every couple year but this movie let it all out for me. And I didn't even see it coming.If you are thinking about watching this movie, it's free on Amazon Prime. There is a ton of junk out there this is worth looking at it. So, I really like this movie."

I wish they made more movies like this that were original and drifted away from the typical Hollywood dribble.This movie starts off with a dude in a wheelchair named Mick. He keeps trying to kill himself (did I mention that it's dark as hell) Then he meets this other dude named Drake. They spend the rest of the film chasing hookers, heroin, cocaine and money. They basically turn on each other and keep trying to kill each other. In all seriousness this is a drama with a dump truck full of heart (and yak). This movie will make you well up with tears like no other movie. Left me thinking about this movie for 3 days after. This movie is well directed and written. 
WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE READY FOR THE FLOODGATES."

I am so suprised that I can relate to a actor that is in a wheelchair, but I did for some reason. I have had family problems and also problems with drugs and no one else has made a movie that touches on me like this film has.

" Drake is the real Hero
",0.5574,0.8305,2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,"This steller movie is about this homeless paraplegic named Drake. Drake has been living on the streets for many years as a heroin addict who lives in a small cardboard box in a Alley in downtown Los Angeles.

" Great Movie
",0.6249,0.9343,2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this movie. It probably didn't get a lot of buzz because no one in it is famous. But I thought it was great. Better than the other stuff out there on Netflix for sure.

This movie is about family and dealing with loss.The director of this film tackled it in an interesting way. Leaving the audience to feel these feelings instead of jamming them down your throat. I don't want to give anything away. This film really stays with you for a few days and is totally worth watching.
" Shot like a classic. Great Film!
",0.784,0.8261,2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Came across this on Prime and thought I would give it a go. What a really great film this was!Reminds me of the older 80's movies that are classics now. The pacing felt a little slow at first and I couldn't understand why, then I got it. They shot it like an older film. There are long takes and lot's of long shots. There also is no cell phones in the film, which I thought was interesting. Like an homage to older films. The story also was shot against traditional. There is no main bad guy, no main goal that I could see. Just a couple of guys trying to figure it out. And it was refreshing to see something different. Great film!"
" I wish I could have watch it in theaters
",0.4019,0.9943,2018-09-06 00:00:00,10,"I remember reading about this movie coming out in theaters and couldn't make it to Los Angeles. It was too big of a gamble to make that trip, but I wish I had.After a long time it finally came out and I was able to rent it on Amazon. It is one of the movies that sits with you long after you watch it. I recommend it highly, it will stick to your ribs.Mickey is played by an actor named Donavon Warren, who I couldn't find any real info on. Looks like this is his first big break. Mickey is paraplegic who can't face the fact that his mother left and so he turns to slitting his wrists. Then he ends up in a hospital and promises not to ever kill himself again to an orderly. This sends Mickey on a journey to find a way to kill himself. He then finally comes to a guy named Drake. Who is hands down phenomenal. I am not sure who is a better actor but the two of them together chew up camera. Mickey pays Drake five hundred dollars to shoot him. Drake tries and does...this is when I could not stop dieing laughing.From there Drake takes Mickey to meet a hooker who Mickey falls in love with. They they go to a drug dealer and get drugs. They shoot up and...Mickey is all skinny and homeless (I don't know how Warren lost all that weight). I need that diet. From there they set eachother on fire and the story keeps going. I don't want to give too much away, but this movie really gets you. The acting is great, the story is great. It's a great film. I just wish I could have seen it on the big screen."
" Through pressure comes DIAMONDS...
",-0.296,-0.3834,2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"And this is a Diamond of a film. I watched and read a ton of interviews about this film. These filmmakers crawled through broken glass to get this film made and out came this unknown gem. I personally think if it had been done by a studio it would have gotten screwed up by the money and control. A gutsy film couldn't have been made this way. This film touches on so many aspects that are too taboo to talk about. It blends them all into a sort of chaos shake and then serves them up with a salted rim. The way the film sways from emotion to laughter to emotion to pain, back and forth it really was put together in a way that has never been done before. And my favorite part was when they are crawling through the house with the opera music at the end. It just...I can't even...The directors really made a masterpiece here."
" Plot twists and a gritty, moving realism
",0.0,0.9582,2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"'Wheels' is both both moving and confronting. The story powerfully builds momentum and keeps pace throughout the film, and its ending is the powerful culmination of an excellently told narrative. Much of the power of the story is derived from elements such as prostitution, drug use, and paraplegic protagonists functioning as the focus of the story, rather than as props enriching it. Instead of wheelchairs being only used as symbols amidst other metaphors, the wheelchairs and, more importantly, the lifestyles and problems they cause or affect are what matters. The result is a unabashed exposé of life in a vulnerable, angry, seemingly helpless state deeply reminiscent of many human struggles, but here seen at a revealing extreme. The openness of the story to the brokenness it portrays makes the eventual revelations much more moving and meaningful, in that they are not only plot twists, but commentaries on how deeply our perspectives on our lives can affect our choices and desires. No scene seems out of place nor unused in delivering the steady succession of narrative impacts, and beautiful cinematography emphasizes the brutal reality of the story of the story throughout. In short, I highly recommend this film as being excellently filmed, fantastically written, and highly enjoyable."
" Must have missed something here......
",-0.296,0.8481,2018-07-03 00:00:00,5,"I've been tracking this movie for quite a while due to the sky-high rating and superb reviews - after a bit of sweat, tracked down a copy and watched it during the weekend. Well....hum?....er?......must have missed something here. Quite frankly, the movie is mediocre at best with subpar acting - save for a very fine Patrick Hume as the mercurial Drake Jones - and with a very lame script. A pair of paraplegic hobos attempting to hustle their way to survival seems fit for an interesting indie flick, a turn-of-the-century take on Midnight Cowboy. However, in various parts, the film just drags on with flashback overkills meshed with overacting; at moments, you seem to be watching a Mexican soap opera or a missed episode of ""As the World Turns""......Its not necessarily a disaster and does have its moments, but, quite frankly, 9,1?!? A bit of editing and less histrionics would have made for a finer movie. The way it is, reasonable at the very most."

The film is so complex and well structured, the actors are memorable, the music is well done... everything about this movie is how it supposed to be in one all time movie classic.
Mickey and Drake, the main characters of the movie can easily become one of the favorite movie couples ever, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

I mean seriously in a weird way I fell in love with this character. He is free in so many ways it made me feel free as well. Most guys in films who are ""the heroes"" talk about hope and living. But when he gave that speech about being screwed and there is nothing you can do about it, it was a refreshing eye opening candid truth. It's the way many of us feel lately. They can't just all be superhero movies, right? Point is this film was gritty and didn't sugar coat things the way most films do and I love that about it. Sometimes you live in the dirt and filth of life and just have to soak it up. Truly a great piece of art. We should have more actors like this in mainstream films. I read that guy Hume broke his finger nails to play this part."

Somehow someone found it on Itunes and we watched it 2 times in a row and then I watched it the next day, because I had some dreams that I was in a wheelchair.

Drake (Patrick Hume) was great too, but Mickey just had such a solid performance. I am surprised he did not get an oscar nom or something for this, but I guess that is how it works for low budget films. They usually don't get recognized.

This is one great Indie movie. I ended up crying like a little baby in the end which I never do. But it just ripped my heart out. Just when I thought it was over it really tore my heart heart out again. The acting was great. Who ever played Drake is seriously one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He could play crazy and then get you emotionaly. Him and Mickey just riffed off eachother in such a good way. When Drake shot Mickey I was hooked. I can't believe I just found this. Everyone should watch this and feel something."

We were talking about whatever and they said ""I watched this really crazy movie last night about these guys in wheelchairs who try and kill each other"". I knew this was something that must be watched immediately.I sat down, didn't watch the trailer, didn't know anything about it. Sometimes I like to go in black and just roll with it. That's my cup of tea.Next thing you know Mickey is on a suicide rampage and I am in love with this film. Is the movie dark? It's hella a dark and hella ballzy. From Mickey going on a suicide frenzy he gets a gun and begins looking for someone to shoot him. Then he rolls into this guy named Drake who is a tornado or white powder and hookers. Mickey pays Drake (another paraplegic) to shoot him and then...We are off to the races... hookers, blow, heroin, homeless people setting each other on fire. This movie is absolutely nuts! In the best way. We you get to the end there are some huge twists that you had no idea were coming and then the movie rips your heart out (out of nowhere).This movie is not just a great indie movie, it's one of the greatest movies of all times. I am not a crier and this movie made me break down into pieces. I called my parents at 3am to tell them I loved them.Story 10

" The mind can give the kiss of life
",0.4215,-0.3823,2018-01-06 00:00:00,7,"If you ever wondered why you should keep struggling in life and never stop trying harder, then you should watch this movie to know what may happen if you ever stopped struggling. You should make your decision out of 2 choices,either to live or to die. Living with drugs,prostitutes and committing suicide is absolutely painful and you are going to feel that pain in the movie.We should wonder about how does it feel to be alive, not how does it feel to die. The darkness in aimless life, the bad company and overthinking about the past can easily keep you hold in place. And all of that is shown clearly in the well made scenes of that talented actors, in addition to the superb directing and photography that cared a lot about the details of the picture.The movie has beautiful twists that will keep you alert for the story, but it may get boring at some points so you may need to play it at double speed.Finally, Remember that ""When you are at the bottom,you can only go up""."
