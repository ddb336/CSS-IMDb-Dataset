" a mess
",-0.3612,-0.4215,2020-06-20 00:00:00,3,"Hard to believe that Thomas, the brains behind the original, would ever allow this over-written and needlessly violent (not to say mean-spirited) sequel for public release. The key ingredients from the 2004, passion and empathy, is replaced with sound and fury. And signifies nothing."
" Don't bother
",0.2584,0.6908,2019-12-04 00:00:00,5,The only thing good about this film was getting Veronica Mars back. Very poorly done. The original 3 seasons of the show were fantastic. The film and season 4 were terrible.
" ""Original enough for you?""
",0.3182,-0.4541,2019-10-27 00:00:00,6,"This had all the look and feel of a made for TV movie, and it wasn't until I came to these pages that I learned that the concept started out as a television series with many of the same players returning to reprise their original roles. Well into retirement, it's difficult for me to identify with these characters and their present day concerns, never mind that they're all living high class lives in sunny California. I couldn't understand why the title character, portrayed by Kristen Bell, continually ignored the attempted contacts by a potential future employer to play detective in her former hometown, even if she was helping out an old friend. The one player who took it way over the top was Gaby Hoffmann, who's performance as Ruby Jetson/Della Pugh, at times looked ridiculously exaggerated and phony. But the bigger head scratcher would have been the Susan Knight 'murder' case that never produced a corpse!!?? How does that work? At least the present day murder of Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella) WAS solved with Veronica's insightful investigation after a number of twists and turns. However if I'd known this was a quite literal ten year reunion of a decade old TV show, I would have bowed out in advance."
" Loved the movie!

" A place holder
",0.0,0.9773,2019-09-03 00:00:00,5,"I've been a big fan of VERONICA MARS since the beginning. It's writing is clever, it's characters well defined and engaging. The mysteries have depth and layers of social commentary and no small amount of a cynical, world weary, tough view of life. The TV series had all of this. This crowd funded movie, which is a product of the longing of it's audience ($2,000,000 was raised in 10 hours), however, missed the mark. Many of the things we admired about the series were missing in the movie. The acting was sluggish, the plot was secondary, it lacked the quick wit and crisp writing. It did, however, give fans lots of inside jokes and cameo snaps of former characters. However, when Hulu brought us a fourth season of the beloved series, everything that made this series great was back in place. The series is on my Top TV Series list, and I rate it a 10 (perfect) out of 10. The movie has now become a blip in the inbetween and I rate it a 5 (a place holder for fan value, only) out of 10. I truly hope Hulu will continue giving us more seasons of this treasured series. {Teen Noir Drama}"
" Logan Logan Logan!
",0.0,0.5517,2019-08-26 00:00:00,8,"This Movie gave me everything I wanted. It is everything a fan would want. That LoVe ending is the only thing I wanted and I got it.
I never had anything against Piz but Logan is Logan.
He had Veronica's heart and mine too.
Never have I ever loved a character more than I have loved Logan Echolls.
Yeah and for the best understanding of the movie you should probably watch the series first."
" I love this show !!

" Classic

" TV Show Pretending To Be A Movie - First Half? - All Filler/Time Waste
",-0.34,-0.7882,2019-02-23 00:00:00,5,02/22/2019 I wasted my movie watching time watching half of this poorly constructed waste of time. Veronica Mars?????? - SUKS
" Glad we finally got a conclusion, even if it's not all that great a movie
",-0.0757,0.9481,2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"I liked the TV show and I'm glad the Kickstarter campaign gave us this. Pretty good all in all and tried to keep the spirit of the series while taking into consideration the fact that 10 years have passed. Still, a few things felt just thrown in there just because, like the Logan/Veronica romance (very unnecessary) and the appearance of as many characters as possible, which felt a little forced at time."
" Logan's murder charges
",-0.7783,-0.8922,2018-10-25 00:00:00,8,Liked the movie but why was a naval officer accused of murder being charged thru local sheriffs office instead of the military's jag office?
" Good ending for the series
",0.4404,0.984,2018-10-05 00:00:00,6,"Veronica Mars isn't a great movie, but it is a pretty good series finale. I'm glad that this iconic television show found a way to wrap-up its storyline. It is fun to see the cast back together again, but it takes more than a casual fan of the series to remember all of the backstory and to appreciate all of the callbacks. Plus, there are some plot points that just don't make sense. Nevertheless, it was fun to spend some time with Veronica Mars once again."
" Detective in the city
",0.0,0.9071,2018-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Veronica MARS looks like VENUS, but is a down to EARTH girl who is from cliche filled NEPTUNE where no one drives a MERCURY. Veronica narrates the last dozen years of her life so we can catch up, but continues her ""Sex in the City"" style of narration well into the film. She is set to work for a law firm in NYC and has a great boyfriend. When someone from her ""nearly everyone is rich and famous"" class is killed, and the main suspect is her ex-boyfriend. Veronica returns to resume her role as an investigator in the case.This was a made for TV formulaic script, and wasn't done well. If you have evidence to clear your client, you present it to the DA and not the local sheriff who doesn't like you. I also don't understand why she never returned the calls or answered the phone from her new employer. She could explain what she was doing, if they were willing to wait, fine, if not, also fine. But to simply ignore the calls without giving them the respect and decency to provide them with information to make a decision is immature and irresponsible.What channel has the ""Columbo"" reruns?Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. no nudity."
" Laughable liberal drivel
",0.0516,-0.8645,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"""When the class war starts, it will start here in Neptune""??? Really? I see Veronica Mars is still the same liberal moronic drivel that it always was. Rich/white men are basically scumbags and cops are corrupt, racist idiots. You know how the rest goes. Get a job Kirsten Bell, a real one that you actually have talent for. That goes for the rest of the cast as well."
