" Much better the paranormal activity
",0.4404,0.2382,2021-04-08 00:00:00,7,This movie is much better then paranormal activity but should've been a little more scarier.
" Worst movie ever seen

" Waist of your time

" DON'T LOSE YOUR TIME
",0.3089,-0.7412,2021-03-12 00:00:00,2,"Terrible cgi....bad story...acting under 0!
I totally lost hours of my life!"
" Don't bother
",0.2584,-0.9012,2021-03-08 00:00:00,2,If you'd like to watch 5 bad actors argue in an old tomb this movies is for you. How this ever got commissioned is beyond me.I mean... Question for you movie buffs. Why do horrors have to be so ridiculously terrible? How is it nobody can actually make a good one?
" This movie is in my top 25.
",0.2023,0.9633,2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Its creepy, the setting is great, Ashley Henshaw did a great job. I love this movie as much as I love as above, so below. Just recently rewatched that as well. This is my 2nd rewatch of the pyramid. Enjoying it as if I've never watched before. I also bought life and dawn of the dead unrated to rewatch as well"
" Good, but the thrill is gone once the monster is out
",0.6369,-0.2584,2021-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Pretty good horror set up as a found footage, but 2.0. Good atmosphere and jump scares. Some actual Egyptian mythology. Did not care much for the ending though. As with most horrors the thrill is gone once the monster is out . Better to keep the mystery going with dark and blurry images than having an awful
mr. Clay thing going on spoiling the party."
" Stunningly bad with few redeeming qualities
",-0.5423,0.8181,2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"So I guess somewhere before filming started a conversation like this must have taken place:Hey guys, are we gonna do a regular movie or one of those found footage movies?
Yes.And it all went downhill from there.
I've long given up on the logistics of found footage movies. It all worked so well back in blair witch project. The audience never sees anything that couldn't and wouldn't have been filmed by the characters themselves. It's amusing how much the pyramid doesn't even pretend to care who is supposed to be filming all the events, as there is at least one extra camera floating around at all times making sure to catch all the ""scary"" (citation needed) stuff that is happening.
Just do a regular movie for christ's sake. Make it cinematic, stylish, tense, creative, everything but this shaky nonsense that won't satisfy or scare anyone.It's frustrating how badly written and made this film is, especially considering the simple if potentially effective premise it's built on and the quality of the sets which look like they cost actual money. Did someone shoot a real film on these and then a couple of student filmers just snuck in at night and made this one in secret? It definitely feels like someone made up the story as they went along.In short: it's not scary, it's dumb, derivative and uncreative, the cgi is laughable, the script is a hot mess, the camera work is terrible, the actors can't decide if they phone it in or chew the scenery and the movie doesn't even have the decency to be unintentionally funny. If it turns out this movie was created by an algorithm I wouldn't be surprised."
" better than what most reviews are saying.
",0.4404,0.1342,2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie despite its bad reviews because I liked the fact that it is a horror movie in a pyramid and I also quite like movies that have to do with Egyptian history. So after having watched it, I have to say that the one and a half hour I spend doing that was worth it. The pyramid might not be a masterpiece but it is definitely a horror movie worth watching."
" Not great
",-0.5096,-0.8919,2021-01-14 00:00:00,2,Couple of ok-ish scenes but that's about it. Bad acting and quite dumb throughout.
" Tries to be Rec (2007),the descent (2005)and as above so below (2014)
",0.0,-0.6821,2020-12-30 00:00:00,4,"The pyramid is one of those movies that had stable source material and could've worked with a good director and script. But it ultimately fails to scare the audience with its claustrophobic setting which in this case didn't work well.
Not only was I not impacted by what should be a tight space to work in that should've made me feel trapped but I felt that the movie was constantly throwing random facts at me to convince me that the main characters were archaeologists when i don't really need as we already know the main characters are.
James Buckley was about the only character I cared for because he was genuinely quite funny in this movie and complained about every aspect which as a Brit myself is very true, brits complain about a lot of things especially this uninspiring movie.
I did however like the theme of this movie, it's about the only thing that works but only in terms of the beginning.
Overall I thought the movie was ok but i feel as through it wasn't made for its audience of 15+ and R in America it feels as though it was made for 12 year olds due to all the jump scares and cringey dialogue.
I don't think I'd ever watch it again because the plot is predictable throughout excluding the ending because the twist is ridiculous and yeah I found it ""meh"" meaning it should be in a sale bin and watched by potty training horror movie makers and audiences.
It's not a bad film but it's just very basic and could've been so much more."
" Horror went wrong
",-0.7783,-0.8748,2020-11-29 00:00:00,2,"It's bad when you and your partner are starting to joke about the unfortunate events that take place in this movie while you're still watching it... The stupidity of the characters, the complete lack of empathy or care for each other (shown in what they did or did not do while one of them got hurt, pit scene anyone?!)... That was really astonishing."
" Reminds med of As above, so below
",0.0,-0.7132,2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"A different plot, yes, but the theme in this film is similar to ""As above, so below"" and other mockumentary supernatural horror films. I liked it and even though it's not a masterpiece it does deserves more than 4.6."
" Good premise. Bogged down by utterly stupid charachters.
",-0.2006,0.4378,2020-09-15 00:00:00,5,Not horrible. Will keep most interested. I just couldn't stand so many charachters that keep displaying utter ignorance and stupidity throughout the film. I will never understand why writers think we want to to watch dumb people make horrible choices for 90 min and expect to keep people interested. Always scarier when people make intelligent choices and are still unable to get away from the danger.
" Decent
",0.0,0.9439,2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"This was a decent movie. As far as B Horror Movies go, this one is a solid B+. Acting is pretty good, set designs are good, and it moves pretty well. It is bette than say Blood Vessel and other movies along those lines. I actually like this better than Hereditary or Midsommar. Aja delivers again."
" Good try for horror movie..
",-0.2023,-0.6115,2020-08-02 00:00:00,6,"A pyramid was hidden inside land and one of the archealogy team try to bring outside world and look inside for something..but they will face more horror scenes than they
had imagined..
One time watchabe movie.."
" Good potential, but bad execution.
",-0.5859,0.9844,2020-07-10 00:00:00,4,"I thought it started out somewhat promising and with some good potential, but most likely needed a higher budget. But sadly quite early on, it just goes a bit sideways. And just turns into any generic low budget mystery-horror.I thought the movie had a fair few good, but maybe not all are actually so historically accurate elements to the pyramid. But appreciated none the less.The cast weren't horrible, but nothing above average. The dialogues was also decently written and didn't just seem half-assed and cringe as some movies of this caliber.I did however sit through the whole movie and without skipping parts, so for that reason I wanted to still give it 5 stars. But the ending will have to cost it that one extra star.
! SPOILER PART BELOW !
However I think some key points to try and make it work, was just silly.
Like they all have light-sources and yet the whole movie is super dark. I mean my tiny keychain LED-flashlight gives of more light than that.Also right from the start they loose their ""life-line"" to the outside. Alright lets buy that for a second, but they also don't even remember which way they came in after walking of 100 meters. You could easily orientate yourself, by which thing they first faced when they crawled up to the apex room.Another small thing is they said the drone cost 3 millions dollars, which is way above the mark. I looked up our police's anti-bomb drone which I assume is somewhat comparable and that costs 272.000 dollars.I thought the ""monsters"" were quite well done. And I found Anubis depicted quite cool on the nightvision. However pretty lackluster in person.
And the ending just became a right mess, sadly. How come the jackal like minions suddenly just seemingly random attack their master, after what is supposedly millennia in that pyramid/tomb together.
Could atleast have finnished of a bit stronger."
" Scary Pyramid
",-0.4939,-0.058,2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"'The Pyramid' mixes 'found footage' with your more traditional filming styles. Acting and script aren't bad and there's some decent tension building, jumpy bits and set pieces but the CGI monster at the end lets it down."
" Not a great movie but very entertaining
",0.4841,0.9817,2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"I found this movie overall to be a fun watch. The acting was a bit dodgy at times, and the characters had moments of being frustratingly stupid, but it was an interesting concept, so long as you like the found footage type of movie. The CGI was mediocre at best, and the CGI of the monster at the end was really not great to the point where I actually found it quite funny. I also enjoyed it because I find Egyptian mythology interesting; although they took a few liberties with it it was still pretty cool.Overall I would say that this is a great movie to watch if you embrace the fact that it's not that technically good and just enjoy it."
" Solid Movie Worth a Watch
",0.3612,0.9871,2020-05-20 00:00:00,6,"I have to disagree with most ratings, this is a decent movie for the genre and definitely an enjoyable watch. No, it's not a horror masterpiece, but it's also not a 4-5 movie. Could have been better but acting, script, and plot were all passable. I personally liked the Archeology aspect - kinda like half horror half Indiana Jones. The mythology stuff wasn't mind blowing or perfect but was good enough to keep me into this fast moving film. Also not nearly as scary as classics like The Conjuring but had me tingling a couple times. Overall, if you like this Genre, go in with low expectations and give this movie a shot, I hope/think it just may surprise you!"
" Totally waste of time,
",-0.4754,-0.8057,2020-05-12 00:00:00,1,"It was one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scenario is so cheap and contrived. Relies on jump scares. I easily guessed what was coming up next as It teeming with boring cliches. If you fond of horror movies, and would like to see fascinating horror films, don't waste your time with it."
" Not sooo bad
",0.431,0.5087,2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Way better than watching La La Land. It's awful actually, but I spent 01:30 of pure fun. Don't take it so serious."
" I actually REALLY liked this film!
",0.6271,0.9875,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"I'll keep this super short, from the opinion of someone who enjoyed the movie from its start to its finish, with one exception - it's basically a ""found footage"" film, which I absolutely detest, as the movie/camera films the events and people involved for what would, in the movie, become a be documentary. When I figured that out, I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I stuck with it. It works for what the director intended, it's just not typically my cup of tea.THE GOOD:
it's a film about ancient Egypt and its mythology. I love good Egyptology-ish films (eg Stargate, The Mummy et al) and they rarely get made, at least decently.it's a film about archeology and adventure. Come on...Indiana Jones put it all of us.it's a monster flick. There are never enough monster flicks on the market.the special fx are quite good. Not perfect, but they enhanced the film, opposed to bad fx which can drag a film down.overall production was well done. The pace is good, the screenplay works very well, andit's a an Ancient Egyptian Monster Movie About ArcheologyTHE BAD:
the acting is not great. It's serviceable, but it feels forced, and the actors overplay their roles at times. Again, it's not horrible, but with some of the cliche lines that regularly occur in the film, it feels forced.the story could have easily supported more details of the specific mythology in the film. The script covered the bare basics but this would have greatly improved both the flow and story depth.it's a ""found footage"" type film, and I despise FF movies most of the time. You might like them, in which case this won't be distraction.Look...this is not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is action packed, paces well, and is a flick that can be watched with some good old fashioned brain death on a couch. Neither is this a ""deep"" film, so there's no need to attempt to decipher meaning or allegory. It's purely surface, which is what I wanted.If you like Egypt, Archeology, Action/Adventure, and/or monsters, you will enjoy."
" Not good
",-0.3412,-0.5525,2020-04-02 00:00:00,5,"I love this kind of movie about archeology and mythology, but this one is just not good. The characters are annoying, specially Nora and the cameraman. Not scary at all and boring."
" Good it's not mummy.
",0.4404,0.9725,2020-03-06 00:00:00,6,"All right, current rating for this movie is 4,6 but i think it should be 5,0 It's not that bad. I think creature are well made, and acting is good.
I think everyone who love Pyramid movies should wath it, despite bad critics."
" Incredibly aggravating!
",-0.4186,-0.8829,2020-02-02 00:00:00,2,"I sat there the whole time yelling, ""no don't do that, get out""! They did the stupidest stuff and the end was the worst!"
" Beyond my Expectation (5.2)
",0.0,-0.9736,2020-01-27 00:00:00,5,"I expected the movie to be very bad because the ratings from the critics were bad, of course, which lowered my expectation but the movie is not bad, there are some logical mistakes and ridiculous scenes.First of all, the subject could be a nice and interesting movie, the script was weak
I would expect the bad character to be a mummy easy to make and cost-effective for low-budget movies instead they wanted it to be a bigger character, but they couldn't make it beautiful either.Yes, the effects were bad, the acting was weak, but it didn't bother action and thriller was good I can say that it was a better movie than the score it got scared in some scenes."
" Surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.9161,2020-01-18 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film. Genuine scares, great cast, great production design, good effects - these 'found footage' films can be really samey but this one is worth your time. Good popcorn creature feature."
" An original and underatted horror movie
",-0.34,-0.3976,2019-12-23 00:00:00,5,"Competently written, acted and photographed, an original monster and concept, i dont see why this movie gets so much hate."
" Not what it was cracked up to be.
",0.0,0.1333,2019-12-07 00:00:00,6,"First off I love movies and mostly hidden gems, after reading the description of the movie I was interested. It started out good setting up the viewer for a tour d force. It was going in the right direction with all the cliche every horror movie has. Once the pyramid was discovered it thought here we go. Once we entered it started to become predictable, with just a few scares to keep you watching. Like all. Movies set in pyramids you had the all to famous traps and obnoxious characters. I thought that with this movie and all they had to work with they run with it making it a horror fest to talk about. The lead female archaeologist was so obnoxious you just couldn't get into her character. Once ybig reveal was shown it didn't help what was going on. The storyline itself was a bit lacking but moveable.Next I hate movies based on speculation which was the bulk of the movie. I prefer at least one character that tells the story. The effects were decent at most and the gore was minimal considering. I like it but not to say it was the new generation of movies. I expected a good use of language which would have been a good upgrade. When a camera get destroyed by ratlike creature's the all too famous (f-bomb) would have been said. Next not knowing what or where you were going would have halted my brakes. Then being archaeologists it's their job explore.I. Just thought the characters were a bit boring and the suspense was low. Yes I did jump a couple times but nothing to brag about. It's a good watch when nothing else is on or on a cold night. Bottom line it's not a keep your attention movie but watchable."
" Intense!
",0.1511,0.2382,2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,Indiana Jones on a horror level this is a gem to watch if you are into horror movies that make you jump and your heart beating out of your chest this is your kind of movie. It reminds you of The Mummy and Indiana Jones but on a intense horror adventure overall a good and fun movie.
" Keep this in the sarcophagus.
",0.0,-0.8775,2019-10-05 00:00:00,4,"Claustrophobic horror that sort of feels like a videogame for all the fruitless wondering and speculation it has, and is horribly marred by its switching from found footage to third person filming.With an unconvincing approach to dialogue and annoying characters, this film, like a lot of similar horror movies before it (I might mention The Descent) just merges in the memory to just a constant bickering."
" Found footage
",0.0,-0.3935,2019-08-31 00:00:00,2,Maybe it was lost for a reason !! I guess it's only plus was at least the camera wasn't shaking as they usually do !
" Just put the camera down and run.
",0.0,0.7964,2019-07-24 00:00:00,5,"This film makes the Tim Cruise version of 'The Mummy's look like a Bettany Hughes history doc. The acting is too light and played for laughs, the plot is paper thin and the whole found footage thing still makes zero logical sense."
" The Pyramid crumbles into an ancient Egyptian mess.
",-0.3612,-0.9786,2019-07-21 00:00:00,1,"Here's hoping Anubis doesn't measure my beating heart on the scales of the afterlife, because with what I'm about to say I don't think he'll approve. This is, by far, one of the worst ""found footage"" horror films I've ever seen. In fact, it's actually so generically terrible, that I wondered if the characters were really in a pyramid or the basement of a Hollywood studio, trying to claw their way to freedom and receive that elusive pay check. A group of archaeologists, along with Jay from 'The Inbetweeners' as the cameraman, discuss the importance of archaeology before entering a newly discovered three-sided pyramid that is a tomb for the Egyptian God Anubis.Firstly, what in the actual hell is Anubis doing wandering the pitch black corridors of a frickin' underground pyramid? Secondly, and this is a direct note to Levasseur, if you're going to use the ""found footage"" technique, stick with it. Switching between handheld and static cameras makes absolutely no sense and is as flimsy as a strand of papyrus. Oh, and to include a score is non-sensical. Thirdly, if you wanted to copy 'As Above, So Below' but switch the location, at least make it half as interesting. Please!Aside from the intriguing thin layer of Egyptology, The Pyramid has as much logical sense as the Book of the Dead. Uncharismatic, unlikeable and problematic archaeologists that struggle to read the most basic of hieroglyphs, let alone attempt to survive a dusty tomb for an hour. CGI monstrosities that burnt my retinas causing temporary blindness (thank you!). Production design that exhumed an extremely low budget, such as pyramid walls clearly resembling chunks of polystyrene. Pharaohs had a bigger budget than that! An underdeveloped sub-plot involving conflict in Cairo, which apparently forced these characters to pack up and depart, despite being located miles away from the city. The film is plagued with ineffective jump-scares, so much so that it indeed concluded on one. Urgh. Leave this pyramid buried forever. Not worth your time in investigating its labyrinthian corridors."

" Didnt even commit to its found footage idea
",-0.2235,-0.7259,2019-06-17 00:00:00,1,"If you are a big company making a found footage horror film please just do it cheap af thats how it should be not glossy and have production all over it. this is a terrible movie that cant even commit to the found footage idea, and the cgi make me want to leap from a building."

No emotion. No 'story' really. Just all around terrible movie, to be honest.I wouldn't give this a shot, and to whomever labeled this under 'found footage', go reevaluate what 'found footage' actually means, and try again..."
" Great concept, but ultimately mediocre.
",0.3716,-0.9455,2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"I went into The Pyramid with relatively low expectations and was actually rather surprised by its concept. However, a great concept does not always equal a grear movie, and that's exactly whag happened here. While the first two thirds of The Pyramid are pretty good, the ending seems rather rushed and too long at the same time.Shamefully, there are also a lot of jumpscares in this movie. I can think of one scary scene without a loud noise that happens pretty early on and is executed really well, but it says something about your horror movie if the scariest scene happens towards the beginning.Ultimately, if you want to kill 90 minutes, this movie does just fine. It's not a masterpiece and it never tries to be. It's a simple, straight-forward found footage horror movie and you'll get what you paid for: Tight corridors, a few gory deaths and a supernatural element connected to Egyptian mythology."

There are twists and some wonderful hints berried in them, no pun intended, if you know you mythology.It truly does bring out a since on the modern and ancient Egypt. With modern political and cultural unrest with the mystery and technological brilliance of the ancient. As well as their own problem. *Hint*The acting is surprisingly top notch! Very believable. You can see the dedication!Overall a very well done movie!

" WHAT DO YOU SEE?
",0.0,0.8185,2018-11-30 00:00:00,1,"This is another poorly shot hand held camera film. The film starts out with potential. An old school archeologist (Denis O'Hare) and his new school daughter Nora the Explorer (Ashley Hinshaw) discover a ancient pyramid in Egypt and they immediately talk about ancient aliens. Eventually a crew becomes lost/trapped inside the pyramid maze. At this point this becomes the best film made for radio. The screen goes dark with an occasional flashlight gracing the screen. People talk and scream as something annoys them which we get to see clearly after an hour into the film, although most of you by this point have already asked for a refund, being satisfied to simply obtain a free movie pass to another film, even if that film is ""Pluto Nash 2.""I liked how they incorporated real life stuff into the film such as using Google Earth to discover the pyramids. (It has been done.) The use of the Egyptian revolt as background. And using a remote robot to enter. These robots were used as early as Three Mile Island and even at the damaged WTC. More people than NASA have them and getting one from someone else might be easier than getting one from NASA, but that didn't ruin the film as did the nonsense of shooting in the dark.Guide: No F-bombs that I recall, no sex. Side breast nudity and close up of high beams (Ashley Hinshaw) There was one funny moment when someone asks, ""What do you see?"" ummm....a flashlight in a dark room? For people who find an hour of watching a flashlight in a room as entertaining, I apologize for offending you."

" In No Way Scary and Predictably Uninteresting
",-0.6597,0.7914,2018-04-25 00:00:00,1,"This is not a well made movie. The preview trailer belies the true plot of the movie and the initial film was a total let down. The film looks like it could be half stock and half found footage. The plot appears to be an adventure to solve the mystery of a found, buried pyramid. This implies a mummy riddle with lost explorers. What is found is a block maze in the dark, ancient booby traps, demonic cannibal cats, and a grotesque Egyptian God straight out of a sci-fi tv channel. The entirety of the movie was poorly executed and the characters were not developed. The film is not scary in any co text with every move being as predictable as the next."
" Laughably bad CGI
",-0.3182,-0.9579,2018-03-27 00:00:00,4,"Its like the producers saw what they Director had done, and decided to cut their losses...One of the plot devices they use to propel the story is the fact their is political upheaval going on in the same area as this discovery, which shortens the window for our explorers. The show this by showing a typical MiddleEast/Egyptian town from above. They then added about 4 black wisps of acrid CGI smoke in random spots as evidence of that political upheaval. The problem is it is some of the worst smoke CGI you will ever see, and it only gets worse at the end when Ra or whomever the Egyptian God, is revealed. If you thought that black smoke CGI looked fake, wait till you get a load of Ra.I was hoping from the pantie peek at the beginning wed see more of Hinshaw, and maybe her UK actor bf for the ladies, but this movie is neither fun nor sexy and wastes the young nubile actors. It shrouds them in darkness, with Hinshaw unattractively whining throughout the movie like a spoiled brat.In the end, you dont even care they all get their come-uppance, as lazy writing and odd camera work that is one moment found footage, and the next an angle on a cameraman would take that shot from....just a mess of a movie and I think the producers knew it before the movie was even finished"
" Please do not disturb the evil Egyptian God!
",0.8579,-0.7814,2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie instantly reminded me of a board game that I used to play at family parties when I was young. I believe it was named ""Escape from King Tut's Pyramid"" and your little figure had to find its way out from a pyramid full of death traps, deadly scarabs, malicious sphinxes and rotting mummies. That's pretty much also the plot description for ""The Pyramid"", although sadly I didn't spot any scarabs or mummies. It has always been my modest opinion that there don't exist enough horror movies dealing with the Ancient Egypt and the creepy Egyptian deities (like Anubis, Ra or Osiris) so I was quite enthusiast to watch ""The Pyramid"", especially when I read that it was the directorial debut for Gregory Levasseur who also co-wrote a few very decent horror films like ""High Tension"", ""P2"" and ""Maniac"". Unfortunately, ""The Pyramid"" was already removed from cinemas after only a week in my country, due to abysmal box office results, and I had almost forgotten about it until it got aired on television. The film is partially in ""found-footage"" filming style and partially in regular third person perspective. I truly dislike found-footage movies, and to mix it with normal camera work is particularly dumb, but apart from that ""The Pyramid"" isn't at all bad. Perhaps I was in an undemanding mood, but the film is fast-paced and gruesome, and Levasseur tries hard to insert tension & atmosphere. Two archeologists, father and daughter, are followed around by a two-headed TV-crew who are shooting a documentary about their diggings in Egypt. They just made the discovery of the century: a completely unknown three-sized pyramid that has been buried deep beneath the ground for thousands of years and probably homes many valuable treasures and wall-paintings. The group are about to descent into the pyramid when they receive urgent instructions to leave the country, because the Arabian Revolution riots broke out in Cairo and the situation isn't safe for foreigners. They stubbornly refuse to abandon their discovery, naturally, and continue with the exploration of the pyramid. They first send in a hi-tech NASA-developed robot camera, but are forced to enter themselves when all images and radio contact are lost. The plot is of course very implausible and becomes increasingly absurd when approaching the finale, but you simply must accept this in case you want to see at least some gore and spectacle. In the vast majority of found-footage movies, absolutely nothing happens except for hysterical screaming, shaking cameras and extremely vague footage of blurry monsters. I still prefer straightforward horror, even when it's sheer nonsense and too obviously computer-generated. Don't look for logic or intelligence too much, just enjoy the sight of malevolent semi-canine gods, fierce rat/cat creatures, impalements and ripped out hearts."
" It's not that bad
",0.431,0.8176,2017-08-18 00:00:00,6,"A group of archaeologists & film makers enter a recently discovered three-sided pyramid, buried in the Egyptian desert, in order to retrieve a $3m robot when they lose communication with it. They find themselves lost & in a deadly fight for survival. James Buckley (The Inbetweeners) provides some light comic relief but overall this found footage style movie is pretty tense, claustrophobic & does have a view effectively horrific moments. It certainly could have been better but personally I found it to be reasonably good."
" Okay premise, poor execution
",-0.296,-0.9144,2017-08-09 00:00:00,4,"As other reviewers have mentioned, THE PYRAMID is a found footage horror movie with an interesting premise but poor quality execution. It starts off fairly well, with hints at political background and some good plotting, before descending into the usual gamut of inane screaming and running around in the second half. Literally the whole second half of the movie consists of characters wandering through dark rooms and getting killed one by one; it's predictable and annoying. The lack of good cast members hurts the film too, with the guy from THE INBETWEENERS hardly qualifying as a quality addition to the mix. One of the few good things I can say is that the CGI work isn't too shabby."
" Enjoyable romp, for what it is
",0.4404,0.8994,2017-07-10 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film, I didn't have high hopes due to some of the other reviews on here - perhaps my expectations being low led to me enjoying this more than I ""should"" have?! I thought the sets, props and effects were very good. The music wasn't overbearing either and added to the atmosphere. I thought James Buckley was very good in his role,that was my biggest worry going into this film, having only ever seen him in The Inbetweeners before this. It was also pretty cool to see Denis O'Hare in something outside of American Horror Story. My only criticism of this film would be it needs to make up it's mind whether it's a found footage or regular film, as in the second half especially it jumps from one to the other, which takes you out of the moment slightly. If you like to watch a film to take you away from reality and not have to think about anything for a couple of hours, you'll enjoy this film. If you're looking for something groundbreaking - keep searching!"
" Anubis is worth it!
",0.2942,0.9151,2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"The human characters are all trite and irritating, but the creatures are the stars and make this movie worth watching. The pyramid itself is somewhat intriguing and the backstory passable. A few gruesome parts. I kept expecting Indiana Jones to show up and save the day! If you enjoy monsters, be sure to check it out."
" Not worth watching
",-0.1695,0.1615,2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"I don't know if in proper English RIDICULOUS is liable to increment but in this case I d like to say MOST RIDICULOUS. Undoubtedly the 6.5 Million budget was just travelling expenses and tickets to the Pyramid, and the movie-making as such, but not much in wages for the actors. Darn, I have seen quite decent movies done with completely unknown actors, but this is not one of them. The keyword is CHEAP. A High School class could do a better job as graduation project. I guess Class C is the proper denomination."
" Had the potential, but sadly blew it.
",-0.5719,-0.7672,2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"This really could of been a good movie, the storyline of a group of Egyptologists and a newly discovered mysterious pyramid had quite a bit of potential. The sets and atmosphere within was spot on, the dialogue and the acting however was terrible and the killer sphynx cats truly laughable. The dialog was so weak, the acting so wooden leaving the characters with no depth at all so that when they met their individual grisly ends, you felt no loss at all.It looks like this movie had a similar if not larger budget than ""The Descent"", which I loved, and it just goes to show how much decent actors, script and director are key to a movies success.This was one of those B movies that was so bad I kind of enjoyed it."
" A mess
",-0.3612,-0.9897,2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"The characters in this film are so annoying that you want them to die. However, when they do die, these deaths are usually quite silly. This film has no clue about style. It doesn't know what it is. At times it looks like a friendly family film reminiscent of Indiana Jones; but then it switches into really nasty gore; and so it switches back and forth. The film is quite silly throughout, though the silliness increases as we approach the climax - if you can call it that.So how do you describe this mess? Think a cheap Indiana Jones clone combined with Alien vs. Predator, only with a tiny budget, crappy actors, and an incompetent writer. In this film, a pyramid is always filled with light whose source is impossible to discern, people reach the bottom of the giant pyramid in about a minute, and archaeologists can read long texts in hieroglyphs on the walls in seconds, by just casually glancing at them. I know they are experts, but this is ridiculous. AVP flashbacks, anyone? Oh, and these 'experts' manage to get lost in the pyramid literally a few minutes from entering the building. Fantastic.Another example of bad writing: the characters find out they are all infected with some disease that is making parts of their body fall off. Kind of makes it pointless to even hope they survive the monsters in the pyramid, since they are all dead already.And the monster is silly.I didn't enjoy this ride at all. I was baffled most of the time, I was never really scared, and I couldn't bring myself to care about the events on screen."
" There are three sides to every storey.
",0.0,-0.8753,2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"A team of intrepid archaeologists and documentary film makers become lost in the bowels of a mysterious 3-sided pyramid, where they find themselves faced with deadly pitfalls, menaced by flesh-eating sphinx cats and hunted by the jackal-headed Egyptian god Anubis, who tears out his victims' hearts.Many a found-footage horror film should carry a warning: Caution! May cause nausea and drowsiness. The Pyramid, however, is one of those rare instances where the hand-held camera style is not too intrusive and the horror aspect is gripping enough to prevent the viewer from nodding off.Admittedly, the script isn't all that original, borrowing heavily from hits such as The Descent (a claustrophobic subterranean location is home to deadly creatures), The Blair Witch Project (characters become lost and are attacked by a legendary being) and even Raiders of the Lost Ark (an Egyptian temple is laden with labyrinthine passageways and booby traps), but first-time director Grégory Levasseur injects enough suspense, effective scares, intriguing mythology and gory thrills into proceedings to make this a fun ride despite the over familiarity of the material and the rather ropey looking CGI Anubis.6/10. Many IMDb reviewers have been rather harsh about this film. I, on the other hand, may have been a touch too generous with my appraisal (I'm a sucker for 'lost temple' adventures). The truth is there are a lot worse films you could be wasting your time with."
" Biggest Pile Of poo
",0.0,-0.3452,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"OMG The only thing I seen that is thinner than this is a skimpy buffet. Complete pile of poop not worth watching, when watching this it was like they tried to rip of The Mummy and Alien Vs Predator in one go. The Main Archaeologist doesn't understand the meaning of tension therefore there was none in a film, The Characters are just not believable and some points in the story had major holes. I just felt like I had been totally ripped off, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the whole thing, but that was a really bad call on my behalfSeriously guys and Girls don't waste your time with this"
