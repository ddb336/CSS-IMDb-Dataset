" An Important Recognition of a Little Known Battle
",-0.1335,-0.8122,2021-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie based on a real battle at Jadotville, Congo defended by an Irish-contingent from the United Nations in 1961 has parallels to the more well-known We Were Soldiers (2002) based on the real events of the first major U. S. battle in the Vietnam War that occurred in Ia Drang valley in 1985. In both instances, the Irish and American soldiers were vastly out-numbered and in both cases fought a losing battle. It is important to note that in the rather remarkable fact of the few casualties of Irishmen in the actual The Siege of Jadotville because without this awareness, the battle scenes in this movie might be become unbelievable to watch. There are various scenes that seem to be overly dramatic, however, and the verbal confrontation between the U. N. Secretary and supposedly members of the U. N. Security Council came across as artificial and superficially produced. Whether the more modern explosive events surrounding the la Drang valley battle made for better cinematography or The Siege of Jadotville just lacked the popular luster of war movies, it is really hard to review this movie. However, it apparently it is an important military event for which the recognition of the Irishmen involved in this battle is worth public notice and our belated respect."
" Amateurish
",0.0,-0.9799,2021-04-06 00:00:00,4,"I quit half way through.The film starts off with exposition titles, the tell-tale sign of amateur writing. Further exposition is promptly delivered to our commander protagonist by a local white woman who looks like she's reading it off a monitor.It's like a high school production, in both script and acting.The dialogues are laughable, The combat scenes looks like an exercise and fail to produce any sense of danger or urgency. They're supposedly outmatched 20-1 but hardly anyone get hit, and when they do it's only a scratch.Following the first assault on his compound, our brave commandant begs for reinforcements over the radio.The politician on the other end uses his deadpan delivery to recite gems like ""We each have our part to play in history. Yours is happening right now"" and ""There are larger things in play than you can't possibly imagine"" To which the commandant woodenly replies ""I don't give a damn about the larger things!""Now there's a soldier with a sniper rifle in the movie, who everyone refer to as ""Sniper"" (i guess they forgot his name and at some point it became too embarrassing to ask).During the 2nd assault, the commandant spots the fat white mining boss monitoring his troops, sporting a shiny, all white suit. He asks the sniper if he can kill him. The sniper picks up a Bren machine gun and take him out with a single shot.So they crush the 2nd assault, even more than they did the first. The mercenary boss that worked for the dead mining boss asks for a ceasefire so his guys can pick up all the corpses. At the same breath, he tells the commandant he should surrender because he's outnumbered (lol).At that point I stopped watching."
" Great movie about poor execution
",0.25,-0.8791,2021-04-03 00:00:00,10,"The movie is extremely well done and shows the tough decisions which must be made by a commander trying to stay neutral, all the while trying to preserve the lives of his men in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds.This movie, and the true events from which it comes, shows what happens when civilians are allowed into the chain of command of military structures; vague orders are passed to military commanders, and those commanders do everything possible to affect those orders; that those orders conflict with the spirit of what their civilian minders have in mind doesn't come into play because of specifics...the civilian ""commander"" says take a radio station...if that radio station is being guarded by mercenaries, who then fire on your military, that military is going to fire back. If they're still under fire, tossing grenades into windows to remove the threat is what the military does; that there are unarmed civilians inside...the civilian minders are worried about the optics. Optics are also what left the Irish forces hanging out at the end of a very tenuous supply line."
" Outstanding!
",0.6476,0.9462,2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"While I have not reviewed a film before, I do read them. I could not stay quiet about this film. This film was truly outstanding and one of of the best war movies ever made. All of the acting was perfection. Way past time for someone to tell this true story of this siege. It is not to be missed. Had me from the start and never let me go.
I will watch and rewatch!"
" Amazing must watch movie !
",0.6239,0.9182,2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"I have given this amazing film a 10 for the fact that it was soo historically accurate! My grandfather was a commandant in the F.C.A which was a part of the irish army, and he use to know commandant Quinlan (jamie dornan) everything that happens in this film happened in 1961! It's an incredible film to watch for its action and its amazing well shot scenes of jadotville! It's a must watch."
" A real find!
",0.0,0.9763,2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Loved this film. Riveting from the start and it rarely let up. If the film were totally fictitious, it would be hard to swallow. However, the fact that it is based on a true story is all the more remarkable. I never heard of the movie or the actual siege, so it was a great surprise. I've recommended it to friends who agree with my enthusiasm. Viewer advisory: Use subtitles. The Irish accents are tough going."
" Brilliant and how a war movie should be.
",-0.0258,0.9542,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Being from Northern Ireland and having worked with Jamie Dornan on a previous production, this caught my attention right away. Tragically, I had absolutely no idea about this incident and proof that their tactics of brushing it under the carpet were effective.
Before watching it, I specifically chose not to read up on the actual events and I'm glad I didn't. This was simply brilliant from start to finish, its almost what a war movie should be like. It's accurate, some of those involved watched it and said as much. Its realistic, no Hollywood grand explosions which could be felt on the moon, no cheesy lines and only one speech which is completely in context.
The sound of the bullets is realistic and the acting is superb from everyone involved and especially Dornan who could stake a claim for the next James Bond. His accent is pretty close as well. The scenery is fantastic as is the camera work and the script is spot on. This is close to being my favourite war film of all time. The suspense is brilliant and the fact that is based on real events is testament to all involved.
If you want gung ho speeches, massive explosions, 1000's of dead bodies, cheesy lines, a Hollywood romance within and more importantly, a Hollywood fairytale ending, then avoid this. If you want an honest, gripping, well acted war film then you will like this."
" Irish and proud
",0.4767,0.4588,2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,This film had me on the edge of my seat quality movie and well worth the watch
" Laughably Bad
",-0.3182,0.6423,2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"The action scenes in this movie are unbelievable...as in I can't believe them. The artillery shells were glorified fireworks, no one can hit anyone in an open field with high powered rifles and MGs. If you don't have the budget to depict a real firefight, don't do a war movie."
" Forgotten UN-events needs more movies like this.
",0.2212,0.9709,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"'The Siege of Jadotville' makes a perfect example of how movies can spread light on forgotten events. I was inspired to read more on the subject thanks to till well written, well directed and well produced movie. A great story and a great movie!"

Must watch movie of you haven't seen it.
Watch with subtitles if English is not your first language for better understanding as the dialogues in the movies are very important to understand what's going on in background."

Why do these sort of films ALWAYS have the slightly insane nasty Sergeant/Lietenent. Why do they all ha e the rogue one of two officers that don't follow the commands given? Hmmm ok."

" Classic war movie!
",-0.636,0.8442,2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,Great story made in a movie. The movie shows the all round struggles of Irish peacekeepers in Africa during General Tshombe's rule. Loved the experience the watching this classic movie.
" One of the great war movies
",0.0516,0.9487,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"The movie tells the true story of a lightly armed company of Irish soldiers deployed on a UN mission and besieged by an overwhelming force of Katangese paramilitaries, during the Congo Crisis of the 1960's. The engagement is a textbook example of a perimeter defence and is brilliantly portrayed. The pace of the movie is perfect, really tight, with no moments wasted. The tension builds perfectly and one is captivated from the start. Just enough of the political backdrop is explained to put things in context; honest without over-labouring the point. Refreshingly, this a dignified rendition from a solider's view of the event, no ridiculous dramatisation here. The action sequences feel very realistic, and the filming and location just right. A war movie with integrity. Superb and highly recommended."
" Enormous waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.9643,2020-07-06 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the worst war movies I've ever seen. This is similar to some old computer games like Virtua Cop. There are attack waves which you need to defend against. Poor acting, poor scenario, everything is poor. Avoid."
" No good deed goes unpunished...
",0.1779,0.5575,2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"This is a really decent attempt at recounting the true story of a battalion of UN peacekeepers from Ireland who were caught up in the Katanga Independence (from Congo) movement in the early 1960s. Jamie Dornan leads the squadron as they attempt to hold their position against overwhelming, and well equipped, opposition forces whilst in fairly typical fashion, the United Nations dithers and debates with the colonial power (Belgium) and the ruthless, clever, leader of the pro-independence movement Moise Tshombe (Danny Sapani) who is backed by powerful mining interests. The acting is really good from all concerned, the dialogue sparing but potent and the sense of peril palpably delivered by director Richie Smyth with some clever pyrotechnics and battle scenes that were reminiscent of a (modern) Rourke's Drift in ""Zulu"" (1964). The political impotence of the UN is writ large, and though this conflict ultimately cost it a Secretary General in Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, it seems the organisation is not much more potent 60 years on!"
" 100th Reviewer and 100 out of 100
",0.0,0.9982,2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"It's a pleasant feeling to find myself as 100th reviewer of this wonderful movie that I have just finished and let me tell you that I feel really happy to write that this movie scores 10 on 10 i.e.100%. Yes many will disagree with me and yes we have many other great war movies that deserve 10. I could have also given this movie an 8 that would seem more reasonable to some but I am here to express my opinion and give it 10, and why not, this is an enjoyable entertaining movie with power packed performances and perfect war cinematography too. An untold story, a historical event told in best possible way. When the director, producer, actor, technical team have done their part perfectly well what is the point in lowering the rating just because we have some other great war movies like Dunkirk or Saving Private Ryan, let's also take this into consideration that this movie is made on low budget it didn't have the luxury of loaded purse and if that's taken into consideration then this movie even deserves even more accolades. Kudos to Danny Sapani, Mark Strong for their roles and most importantly Jamie Dornan as Commandant was awesome.This movie is about a truly great act of Irish military's heroism in a disputed territory in Congo where a handful of soldiers got surrounded and attacked by thousands of enemy forces who were fully equipped with modern weaponry backed by Western powers. The Irish fighters' courage, their valor and their strategies in the given adverse circumstances has been displayed exceptionally well. Not only are they carrying the baggage of their country's pride but they are also representing United Nations. The movie also touches upon the important political developments simultaneously and hence viewer gets a good understanding of it's political background very well.This movie not only entertained me but educated me. Thanks to this film otherwise I wouldn't have known about this historical event. Even the ending part of the movie is emotional but different. So I will highly recommend this movie specially to the War movie lovers, yes those who don't like war-action genre much may or may not not like it. But for war movie fans this is a must watch.Let me tell that I am not an Irish but an Indian and I could very well relate to this saga as many similar incidents have taken place in our history too like in 1897 during the British rule only 21 Indian soldiers faced ten thousand numbered army in a difficult terrain and held on to their post until the last man got martyred. Such acts of valor has to be saluted, respected and honored be it from whichever country, their history should be told.A Salute to the brave Irish Soldiers!!"

The true events that took place are a great story by themselves and this movie does an excellent job at portraying the parties involved on a movie screen. Highly recommend the watch if your on the fence."
" A good one!

Armchair warriors & politicians treated them like cowards knowing nothing of the truth and predicament that was inflicted upon them. Sounds similar to today's keyboard warriors hiding in the safety of their homes behind their secure screens. Salute to the bravery and staunch of these men. Please be reminded that what you hear and see from the media is not always true, in fact the opposite is usually the case."

" An untold story highlighting the complex histories of our world
",0.0,0.9231,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,I liked it. The cinematography was beautiful and the dialogue was really well written. The Dr O'Brien character was a bit too ambiguous for my liking but I think that helped to paint a picture of that era of the UN. Overall a good film with an interesting historical story
" Is more a Disney movie than a war movie
",-0.5994,0.8968,2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,"I didn¬¥t like the movie. Maybe is because I've watched a few real good films about war lately (Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, 1917, All quiet in the western front, Flags of our Fathers...). Well, this film is not in the same level. The idea is fine, the plot is spectacular to do a good movie, but the final product lacks quality, it¬¥s difficult to engage with it, there are a lot of flaws, well, summarizing, I didn¬¥t like it. Please netflix, get away from cinema, you are sinking the ship."
" Kids' War Movie
",-0.5994,-0.9254,2020-04-01 00:00:00,3,"Standing still in an open battlefield ?? No war tactics , no soldier covering , no dead enemy's ammo taking etc etc etc .. Generous 3 star from me"
" Great film
",0.6249,0.8316,2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Surprised how great this film is, true story too.."
" A forgotten story worthy to be told.
",0.25,0.8321,2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"I never heard of this battle before, and I'm a Belgian. Apparently this combat story has been held secret from us, or maybe I just skipped a lesson when they teached us that historical fact, that's also possible. Nevertheless, it doesn't really matter, as once again it's proven that war is fought by people that massacre each other but don't know each other, commanded and benefited by people that know each other but that don't fight each other. It's an interesting story, certainly entertaining, even for people that are not into war movies. A poignant story about courage, desperation and combat tactics. The cast was very good, with an excellent Jamie Dornan playing the main character Patrick Quinlan. Richie Smyth did a good job directing this hommage to those men that once came home as supposedly cowards only to be recognized as heroes fifty years later, typical again for the insanity of wars."
" Strange thing
",-0.2023,0.9042,2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,"The movie's nice, everybody watches a movie with different perception and I was watching it for fun but the funny thing is that they are fighting in an open area, the distance between the both fighting groups is hardly few meters, they keep shooting like a thousand bullets and nobody gets shot lol, ain't that funny?"
" A Missed Opportunity
",0.1531,0.9877,2019-10-25 00:00:00,5,"Having had worked in Katanga and being a history buff, I wished this movie would have done much better justice to the bravery and brilliant tactics of the Irish soldiers who managed to fend off a much superior force during the brief secession bid of that province in 1961.The subject itself has been little explored but it is very fascinating. That a company of poorly supported Irish soldiers was able to fight off a brigade-size unit of Belgian, French, and Rhodesian mercenaries supported by aircraft, without losing a single man during a 6-day siege, is simply nothing short of exceptional.Much credit for this has to go to Commandant Quinlan, the officer in charge of the company, who was shamefully scapegoated for the failures of the UN peacekeeping force by no less his own government. Although he was posthumously recognized for his skillful defense, I find it sad that he had not lived to see his own exoneration.As other reviewers have said, this movie is uneven. Given that Commandant Quinlan and his men were treated poorly by their own government and the Irish Army after the siege and their subsequent release from captivity, this should have played a more prominent role in the story telling because it is very much central to the overall story itself.In addition, the movie should have focused more on the experiences of these men and their backgrounds prior to and after the battle, not just on the battle itself. Perhaps even more storytelling about the politics surrounding the battle would have been welcomed. Thus it was clearly a missed opportunity to show why they deserve praise for their actions during those few days in late 1961 in the newly formed Republic of the Congo.A side note: It was good to see Jamie Dornan outside his most recognized role as Christian Grey. Kudos to him."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.6119,2019-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I love war films, particularly true stories, but I'm generally wary of ones I've never heard of before watching them.This was a surprisingly gripping film that had my attention from start to finish."
" true stories deserve telling well
",0.5994,0.9651,2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"The story of Jadotville is, itself, a compelling story.A story of amazing resilience and the stubborness that is the mark of heroes. This film is worthy of your time simply because of the story itself, a story long hidden from the world by the supposed necessities of politics.
So often,however, such amazing stories are told with a glamour and glorification that undermines the truth of the events. This film does not surrender to that mythology.
It is a direct,raw,unequivocable scripting of a series of events and battles that reflect the determination of well trained men not to give in to feelings of hopelessness or defeat. Indeed, the script neither amplifies nor diminishes the power of their courage.
Extremely well directed and superbly acted it refuses to allow your emotions to simply be an oberver of the circumstances.You become directly involved, such is the high quality of this film.
I agree with xenonkuraz and believe this film will more and more be recognised as a classic iin it's genre.
If you can stand to watch ordinariness become some of the greatest displays of valour as a result of good training ,you should watch this film.
157 relatively lightly armed men battled against 3000 (with a little air support) for many days. If those statistics don't grab you, then don't bother watching because you have no grasp of the reality.
But if you do choose to watch this excellent film, I challenge you to stop watching after 15 minutes!"
" Let Down by Action Scenes
",0.0,0.5267,2019-10-01 00:00:00,5,"Good story and good characters with excellent build up. Action scenes are absurd, whilst the film is set i the 60's there is no need for the ridiculous and somewhat cheesy portrayal of combat that was the norm in Hollywood back then."
" Peacemakers vs. Warmongers
",-0.1027,0.9838,2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,"The Siege Of Jadotville (Katanga, Congo) is the historic battle between the Irish Peace Forces of the United Nations - Commander Patrick Quinlan and his 150 heroic soldiers - who were besieged in 1961 by the Belgian and French mining companies who murdered President Lumumba. It is also a great recognition of the courage and integrity of these men, as well as the honor of peaceful nations like Ireland. Countries, who have never assaulted anyone in their history, and who work for World Peace. Unlike others, who constantly invade, loot, and commit crimes against humanity."

" standard true war story
",-0.2732,-0.2909,2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,"It's 1961. Newly independent Congo is in the turmoil of a civil war fueled by the Cold War and mining riches. The UN sends Irish peacekeepers to the town of Jadotville in the middle of a rich uranium deposit. Moise Tshombe is the smiling murderous leader of the State of Katanga. He recruits 1000 French mercenaries from De Gaulle. Irish Commandant Pat Quinlan (Jamie Dornan) is inexperienced like the rest of his men. Sergeant Jack Prendergast (Jason O'Mara) is the hardened one. Irish politician Conor Cruise O'Brien (Mark Strong) leads the mission and orders an aggressive takeover of the Katanga capital. The situation spins out of control and Jadotville comes under seige by overwhelming forces.This is a rather standard war movie especially with its battle actions. It has the thrills of the standard old war movie with the wave attacks. One expects better tactics from the enemy. This doesn't go that much into the personal lives of the soldiers. In a way, I appreciate that. The movie introduces a romantic interest but quickly cuts her out. It's as if somebody had a change of opinion about injecting a romance into the battle. The ending does come as a surprise. The truth needs some way to spice up the tension."
" Another bad netflix movie with overwelming fake reviews
",-0.765,0.653,2019-06-13 00:00:00,3,"The script is meh, the acting is meh, the story told is ok I guess, but the way it's told is another very big meh.
Movie could at best score a 5/10 if you're just a fan of superficial movies and the script and acting don't matter to you. How this movies gets so many 10/10 would have been an enigma if the fake reviews weren't so obvious to spot."
" Simply Remarkable
",0.5574,0.5859,2019-05-02 00:00:00,10,Splendid movie. Makes you glued to the movie the whole time. Really tells you the sacrifices and the decisions of a soldier on ground.
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.8908,2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,I'm so happy they are making movies like this. It really shows what infantry men have to go through. They do there job without evening know what they are getting themselves into. Great movie and it show you that the military will never change and that soldiers are just another cog in the machine.
" Great narration
",0.6249,0.9079,2019-03-09 00:00:00,9,One of the best story narration. People usually does not want to discuss about a failed battle. But the soldiers fought brave against all odds with their limited supplies and moral support. This is true valour and courage.
" The True Story that is only known by those who were there
",0.4215,-0.9519,2019-03-06 00:00:00,10,"When this movie came out, I specifically created a Netflix account, just to see this movie, for one reason and one reason only. I had served alongside some of those who were at the Siege, and didn't know it for many years. I was 3 years old when it happened, I was only thinking of my next sweet, while men were wondering would they live or die.As a movie buff, I found the script, acting and direction to be of equal par, compared to big budget movies of similar stories. The difference is, this story is current and can be verified, others are possibly verified owing to age and interpretation. The fact that the flash bangs were not as loud as big budget movies, made it all the more real. Anyone who has fired a weapon will know what I mean.Some reviewers have questioned aspects of the movies, let me clarify. First of all, it is a movie, a means to tell a story, whether real or imaginary therefore; one should always be a sceptic when viewing. Also, when one is viewing a movie ""based on a true story"", one should always allow a certain amount of leeway of truth, which enhances the movie. Now, to what makes it real.The Jadotville Rats WERE vilified as cowards upon their return, they only finally received recognition for their actions in 2017. The battle scenes, while being a film makers ideal, were carried out as per Irish Military Training.. I was a military aircraft technician and had no interest in being a soldier per se but, as the movie progressed, all the training I received at the start of my career, came back into clear focus. The instructions given by both the NCO's and ultimately Comdt Quinlan, in the movie, were absolutely correct. I retired as a Senior NCO Air Crash Investigator, so I can speak with some authority.I believe that there are two problems with those who don't have a positive thing to say about the movie. The first is, they don't actually believe that Ireland has ever been involved in an International Conflict. They should look to the lives lost in Lebanon alone (47 in all), soldiers who never came back home alive; and the number of UN Mission they undertake in a given year. Oh, and for the keyboard soldiers, have a look at the shocked faces of American News Reporters, when The Irish Army Ranger Wing won the US Army International Sniper Competition, beating America, Canada, England and Germany, among others, in 2018.The second is, it should be remembered (for those who don't know or never heard of) the failed Rising of Easter 1916 against England, during WWI, and the subsequent Civil War of 1920 - 01, which brought about the Birth Of A Nation (and the movie Michael Collins); the actions of this little Nation was the spark that ultimately dissolved The British Empire.Whether you like it or not, these men fought gallantly, and lost. However, it was the battle they lost, not the respect of their ""enemy"", which is clearly shown in the movie, and not as part of a movie plot. I'm sure those of better means can prove, no bodies were flown home to Ireland, all were returned to their loved ones alive, and death certs for the opposing forces can be found, to verify. I won't, I respect my comrades too much to question their families, and as a member of the Military, I also know how to show respect to the ""enemy""."

There are lot of unknown actors and a few C list.As for the movie it self : It's laughably bad
It could've been so much better if the director had actually decided to use,some of that military training, he had the poor chaps go through. In order to prepare for the movie.
I mean. You have the good guys walking up right, in an open field in the middle of a firefight and no bullets hit them.
They don't shot at priority targets,and the sniper can only hit once in a blue moon.
You have the bad guys, standing up right on the back of a pickup feiring 50 cal,and they don't get hit.
The good guys store their ammo above ground.Even though they know the enemy has mortars.To be blunt the Irish peacekeeping commander can't do anything right. I get that he had no War background,but C'moon. Most of what he does is text book of what not to do. They don't even have the god given sense, to take ammo from fallen enemy until he last minute.
Oh and did I mention their bullets can't hit a single french merc. no matter how much he stand out.If this movie,really is based on a true story. I understand why they wanted to keep it a secret. The action of the Irsh peace keeping forces commander was so embarrassing ."

It's possible and not same the attacks on the Irish forces from the French and Belgium troops with African and how hard it is! And the defendera from the Irish troops! It's not possible the heavy attack and there's no more deaths! Did the movie story be made or the fact that it was?"

" Surprisingly good story from an unknown engagement
",0.7964,-0.9792,2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"One of the problems with war movies is that they tend to attract reviews from military anoraks, all of whom have biases in favour of one or other army/force/grouping. ""Yeah, the SAS would make mincemeat of them"", or ""they wouldn't last three minutes against the Navy Seals"", or whatever. Scroll through the reviews of this movie and you'll find similar here. A certain amount of realism is important, but just how realistic were ""great"" war movies of the past, particularly the British war movies from WWII?In reality, very few western soldiers ever fire a shot in anger, so in point of fact, stories like this, where peacetime soldiers are thrust into an actual firefight carry their own realism. Some here have argued the unlikelihood of a five day fire fight where hundreds of the enemy are killed and none of the defenders. Yet, that IS exactly what happened at Jadotville, with estimates of enemy losses ranging from three hundred to one thousand. The broad sweep of the story is true.With that in mind, the only question is, is the action believable? The answer is, yes, it is. It's amazingly well done on what must have been a tiny (by Hollywood standards) budget. Commandant (Major) Quinlan leads a small troop of Irish UN peacekeepers holding a small outpost in Katanga. After the UN forces assault the Katangan rebels under the orders of Connor Cruise O'Brien (Mark Strong), the UN leader on the ground, the mercenary forces retaliate by attacking the isolated Jadotville outpost. There follows a five day siege in which the Irish defend their position to the last bullet while being left unenforced and unsupplied by their superiors.The machinations of the UN are well covered, and the oily Connor Cruise O'Brien -- a real person who is not fondly remembered in Ireland -- is portrayed well by Mark Strong, who is a better actor than he is often given credit for, although I would have liked a little more on what happened after Commandant Quinlan arrived home and he had to put up with the insinuations of career soldiers who had never heard a gunshot. Ignore the begrudgers. This may not be a great movie, but it is a good one telling a more or less true but almost forgotten story."

I was watiting for an Africn sniper to took him down and it make the movie better but nothing they are all lucky.
I dont understand how 150 Irish men surrounded by 3,000 Congolese troops, no Irish man die even they got attacked by Congolese warplane and 300 to 1,000 of Congolese died, it shows that the African troops are very stupid and the Irish men are brave and clever.

" A bit hammy but quite interesting and entertaining
",0.8495,-0.9367,2018-10-14 00:00:00,6,"The Congo, 1961. Due to escalating tensions in the area, the UN sends in a company of Irish peacekeepers into the province of Katanga. They are to hold the town of Jadotville at all costs. The local warlord recruits 1,000 French mercenaries, ostensibly to protect the mines in the area. However, after the UN goes on the offensive, the mercenaries are unleashed on the Irish company. The odds are stacked against the Irish, and their UN bosses don't appreciate the precariousness of their situation.Not immediately engaging, but gets better. The set up was quite weak, the character development token and some of the performances left a lot to be desired (so many bad fake Irish accents!). Moreover, it was not obvious whether the enemy were actually the bad guys - the warlord initially seemed to have a good case to defend the area.However, it gets better as the movie goes on. It becomes clear that the warlord is even worse than he was initially portrayed and the bad guys really are the bad guys. The battle scenes are great and the suspense and engagement ramps up.Overall, an interesting and entertaining depiction of one of history's lesser-known battles and conflicts."

It was nerve-wrecking at times and quite spectacular, actually. The action scenes were very good and the photography good, as well. I really rooted for the guys, and the film proofs so well (once again) that the guys in suits in their offices has no idea what really goes on in the field, and quite frankly often does not care as long as they win a war.All the actors were very good and believable, especially Jamie Dornan as Quinlan.

" Superb
",0.6249,0.9869,2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This is probably one of the best reenactments of a military engagement I have ever seen. In terms of its quality as an account of military heroism I'd put it up there with Zulu. Its certainly better than any American film I have ever seen, with the possible exception of Blackhawk Down. It is quietly respectful. It is a mature, intelligent adult retelling of a siege in Africa, the Congo, Katangha that few even in my generation (60+) have ever hard of. It is Irish to its cote and Irish make some very high quality movies. IMHO it knocks the socks off such as 'Generation Kill', and '12 Strong'. I'd rather watch the Siege of Jadotville anyday to such as those. Thanks to Director: Richie Smyth, Producer: Alan Moloney, Screenplay: Kevin Brodbin, Story by: Declan Power for bringing the story to us. You have done a long overdue honour to those brave men of the Irish UN force."
" Simply outstanding.

This film had me hooked within the first minute, and I'm sure it'll be one I'll watch again and again for a long time. From the very start I formed a very human connection to the characters, not just 'some other soldier' as some other war movies make them out to be. I could relate to each and every one of the soldiers on the screen and developed a very deep connection with every one as if I were fighting alongside them. The dialogue is absolutely amazing to say the least, the narration was absolutely stellar, and the storyline flows incredibly well at a reasonable pace; nothing too fast and nothing too slow, just perfect. The climax had me on the edge of my seat. Jamie Dornan's outstanding portrayal of Quinlan in particular was definitely the driving force that anchored this film. Overall, this movie is definitely a must-watch. I am sure it will one day go down as a major classic. Many people need to see this outstanding story of courage, unity, and brotherhood, a type of story that is hard to capture and successfully orchestrate. This movie captured this essence with the finest level of perfection."

The alternate story is one of self serving, self aggrandizing politicians - the antecedents of those we see everywhere today. These miserable cretins were willing to sacrifice good men for a stated reason of avoiding world war - of course this is BS as it always is, the careers of these rat like parasitical creatures go from strength to strength (and wealth to more wealth) while honorable servicemen are left to languish.

" Excellent Historical Drama About A Failed UN Peacekeeping Mission
",0.5267,-0.9908,2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Canadian soldiers have participated in many UN peacekeeping missions over the years and have known their share of failures caused by UN bungling - Gen. Romeo Dallaire and the Rwanda massacre being the best example. That history made me as a Canadian interested in a movie about this failed UN peacekeeping mission. Apparently the Irish government largely covered up this incident from the 1961 civil war in The Congo, in which a force of Irish peacekeepers was sent in under the authority of the United Nations and ended up coming under attack from a much larger force of Congolese rebels and international mercenaries. Acquitting themselves well, the fact that they were forced to surrender because they had run out of ammunition, were heavily outnumbered and because of atrocious UN bungling led to them being regarded as cowards and to their mission being considered a black mark against the Irish Army. It wasn't until the 21st century that an Irish Government review cleared ""A"" Company of the accusations against them and they were recognized and honoured, as they should have been all along.The story is a good one and holds up the bungling and backroom wheeling and dealing for everyone to see, while the various bunglers left ""A"" Company and its plight largely ignored. Where does one begin with the mistakes or bad calls that were made. An Irish company with no battle experience under the command of an officer who had read a lot about battles but had never been in one was sent into the middle of a civil war. The UN leader on the ground (O'Brien) who was an academic with no sense of the strategic realities of the situation. The French (represented in a brief scene by de Gaulle) arranging for French mercenaries to get involved in the civil war against the UN forces. A local population in the area of Jadotville (where the Irish compound was located) who didn't want the UN or the Irish there. An Irish general who seems too paralyzed to do anything. The whole thing was a tragedy waiting to happen from the very beginning.Thankfully, there's not much time given to the backstories of any of the Irish soldiers. This was meant to be a war movie (even though it was about peacekeeping) and it gets into the situation leading up to the battle pretty quickly. I thought Jamie Dornan did a fantastic job as Quinlan - the Irish commander of ""A"" Company, and Mark Strong as Conor Cruise O'Brien captured the image of the incompetent UN bureaucrat who knows a lot but who has no real clue what to do.This is not a very well known historical incident. I didn't realize when I sat down to watch it, for example, that this was the incident in which UN Secretary General Dag Hammerskjold was killed in a plane crash while en route to try to negotiate an end to the civil war. It's a well told story, it's only weakness perhaps being that the average viewer (not particularly aware of the incident - and I count myself among those) might have benefited from a bit more of the political background to the story, as well as a bit fuller account of the negotiations that led to the Irish troops being released after their surrender and a month in captivity.

Because of its previous neutrality, it was chosen by the nascent United Nations to try to hold peace in a southern province of the Republic of Congo in the early 1950s.The movie follows the deployment and action of ""A"" Company as they try to defend an outpost.The action is quite realistic and does not appear staged and while the outcome of the siege becomes clear, it is not overplayed.A small piece of history hidden from the view of the Irish people for way too long and brought to the screen with skill."

But it would unfair judging someone just by one movie they did (I have only seen the first 50 shades movie so far). So in company of some really good actors and in battle portraying a real incident/event from the past, he succeeds to convey more emotion than in a movie that is supposed to be about emotions/feelings.But let's stay with this, and its politics. Sometimes you find yourself being a pawn for someone else and not really being able to go anywhere else. So only thing/way to go is forward. And that's what this movie is about (and courage), amidst one of the worst situations you can find yourself imprisoned in. Since this is war, there is violence of course, and there will be almost unbelievable situations. But this actually happened (more or less), which makes it even more powerful"

However that is not the reason I am rating it so low. Call me a stick up the ass but I like attention to detail and realism and honestly this siege made me cringe over and over again. Tactics on the part of the Frenchman were horrendous. There was a nearby hill that was never tactically used and meanwhile they just kept running in with numbers from the same side every time. (and I thought he was supposed to be a brilliant contractor or something) They also never used their artillery, easily could have spent the whole time just landing bombs on them until they surrender which is probably what really happened. Also, every time I had to watch the sniper reload a bullet in the chamber he made me cringe. (if you don't know why then don't worry about it.)Lastly there were a few other funky scenes like that that stood out to me but one I remember in particular is when the enemy forces came with a mounted heavy machine gun at one point there was a guy holding it by its barrel as they were shooting.

" The movie looks good, but is far from real story
",0.2382,0.6849,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Hi from Russia!The movie is good, but it is far from real story (as many movies).I researched 1960th Congo war a bit after watching this movie and found some interesting facts (sorry for poor English): Many attackers (africans) were archers or had pump rifles (but most white instructors were professionals). UN contingent was placed near Jadotville to protect white population of Jadotville but (surprise) white population was against UN contingent. Heave weapon haven't been used by gendarmes against UN troops - the target was to capture UN Irish, not to kill them all. This is most important fact explaining number of casualties on both sides (and gendarmes are not as good as army troops).Fighting scenes in the movie looks like a massacre of the innocents, I personally have nothing against the Irish, the are good guys and fighters but this movie doesn't show them as on real war, at 100% of their capabilities, it is more like being on training with live targets, shooting untrained cannon fodder armed by pistol caliber machine guns in open field by heavy machine guns and rifles. Yes, UN guys had some stress and 5 wounded but it is not a battle with equal enemy. And it was not 24/7 battle, UN personnel could visit church, make photos, sleep at night, not drinking water with diesel (it is not a whiskey, but when you want to drink, some diesel in the water is not a problem), etc.If someone is interested to find more about real story of UN in Congo war, they should check story of UN 99th Indian brigade in Katanga, who bore the brunt of the fighting in Katanga, together with Ethiopians. I hope one day someone will make movie about them (may be Bollywood?)."

The outnumbered and outgunned 'blue helmets' hold on for several days while Mo√Øse Tshombe (The Prime Minister of Congo), UN functionaries and national politicians maneuver to control as much of the mineral rich (including uranium) Katanga as possible. The movie features extensive battle scenes which are very well done and seem realistic (IMO, but I have no experience with combat). Based on comments in IMDb and elsewhere, the film is a reasonably accurate recreation of the events (admittedly with a few added 'dramatic touches') although the implication that a Phantom II jet was instrumental in the death of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld seems to be a nod to conspiracy theorists (as I gather little is known about what actually brought down his plane). Good 'men under fire' acting and a great showcase for vintage small arms and a lovely Fouga Magister jet for those who like such things."

And in fact it wasn't distributed until Netflix picked up and some of the smarter raters highlighted it. Nicely done Netflix. Based on a true story about an Irish peacekeeping mission in the Congo under the UN flag in the early 60's where the military is hung out to dry. A time where the UN was focused on legitimacy while the world was focused on the cold war. Solid acting, good script, reasonable cinematography. This is not a high budget thriller, or, thankfully Hollywood propaganda, hype or horse----, but a reasonable telling of a true and fascinating story that encourages you to read the full facts on what actually happened."

After I looked at the account on wikipedia of the actual event / people I found this film even more irritating. What I liked: The actors for the Irish soldiers all come across well. You do get the idea of close knit small unit facing their baptism of fire. Battle scenes were quite exciting. What I didn't like. The usual (of late) Hollywood bad writing /character stereo types/ assuming the audience is stupid. The portrayal of the intrigues and schenanigans of the UN, Charles De Gaule, big company mining operations, mercenaries and African politics was just mind numbingly bad. 2d cardboard cartoon caricatures and scheming worthy of Wiley Coyote. I suspect if they edited the lot out it would be a better film.Pork pie beret's everywhere. The guy who played the chief mercenary had no charisma at all. But I grudgingly did enjoy the film despite myself. Watch once but never again."
" Hidden gem!

Seems Netflix has a promising future in the movie department now too.Draws understandable comparisons with Zulu, but the real shame is behind the true story here and the reason why it's not a widely known about event.Ignoring the real events (which were incredible and worth further research) the movie really stands on its own as a thoroughly entertaining war film. Tensions builds nicely and results in a whole load of impressive action sequences. Credit to Dornan who is unfortunately going to be more known for the whole 50 shades nonsense, hopefully once he gets past that he wont be held back on more decent roles."
