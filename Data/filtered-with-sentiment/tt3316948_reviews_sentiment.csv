" Personality void.
",0.0,-0.4678,2021-04-04 00:00:00,2,"Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart together again at last. Two 'actors' devoid of any personality, mustering the enthusiasm and energy of underpaid teenage McDonald's employees. Other capable players cannot save this from being a forgettable black hole of information.Actually Kristen & Jesse have each shown up on the odd very rare occasion when you can tell they are invested, but this is not one of those. Two negatives do not make a positive."
" Fun action movie
",0.5106,0.9903,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I just watched it for the 3rd time over the last 6yrs and was still entertained. It's not a perfect movie, but it's fun and if you're just looking for pure entertainment, it's worth the watch: funny moments, full of action and some solid actors (along with a couple so-so ones). Laugher was great and even brought some emotion to his last scene.
Flaws: Stewart in the female lead wasn't a great choice and it wasn't Toffer's best acting, the drug dealer was cartoonish and it could've benefited from some additional character development and more details about the back story.
I'm giving it 8 stars, because despite all its flaws, it's genuinely an enjoyable watch and you won't be bored. I don't regret watching it... again."

" American Ultra (2015, Nima Nourizadeh) Good idea for a crazy stoner Kick-Ass, but should be even more outlandish with more action!
",0.1386,0.995,2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"American Ultra (2015, Nima Nourizadeh)
Nourizadeh only has two feature film directing credits to his name and both I think can be characterized as pleasant surprises. The first is 2012's 'Project X' which I think is a very underrated high school party comedy, and second is 'American Ultra'. This is an action comedy that basically wonders what if a loser stoner was really a badass secret CIA asset. This isn't blowing the doors off anything, but it is a bit different, a bit quirky and a fun movie to watch.
The cast here is pretty good with Jesse Eisenberg starring as Mike Howell and Kristen Stewart as his longtime girlfriend Phoebe. They are both stoners not amounting to much living in nowhere, West Virginia. Mike longs to take his girlfriend to Hawaii and propose, but he has crippling anxiety which won't allow him to leave town. We also learn of some high level CIA people who are running black ops type programs. Connie Britton is Victoria Lasseter and Topher Grace is Adrian Yates and they are at odds. We learn that Mike Howell is an asset that can be ""activated"" and it was a project helmed by Lasseter but was ineffective and abandoned. Yates is resurrecting it with his own goon squad and he wants to take Mike out because he deems him a threat. Victoria gets wind of this and secretly journeys to WV and activates Mike. At first nothing, but very quickly we see Mike turn from stoner loser into stoner badass. He runs around for the balance of the movie trying to save himself and his girlfriend as well as trying to figure out what the heck is going on. There is good humor as well as some fun stylized action which really gives this simple, but entertaining movie a kick in the pants. Eisenberg and Stewart have good chemistry together. I like Eisenberg in roles that are sort of Michael Cera type roles but you don't want Michael Cera cause you are kind of sick of him. Eisenberg is a better actor with a bit more range. The supporting cast is also good including Walton Goggins, Tony Hale and John Leguizamo.
This isn't a stellar film and while open for a sequel I don't think really merits one, but also it is by no means bad. If you are looking for a fun, mild mannered comedy with some good action then this will be an entertaining find worth checking out. It is R rated and the action does splatter somewhat, but I think it is all part of its charm.

I still had to give it a 10 for originality, creativity, and Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Connie Britton contribute great performances, Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo fill in the rest as supporting.

" American Ultra
",0.0,-0.9974,2020-07-04 00:00:00,4,"The Geena Davis movie The Long Kiss Goodnight was going through my mind when I read the description about this film, it is certainly similar in that the character is an every person with amnesia that used to be a superspy or assassin, but it takes a different approach to this idea. Basically, in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia lives Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), a stoner and a convenience store clerk. He plans to propose to his long-time girlfriend, Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart), on a trip to Hawaii. But he cannot leave, as he suffers intense panic attacks anytime he tries to leave town. He questions why Phoebe puts up with him. In Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her ""Wiseman"" Ultra program, is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), and his similar ""Toughguy"" agents. Lasseter travels to Liman and, feeling a duty to protect him, she ""activates"" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves frustrated. Mike encounters two Toughguys agents and is attacked, but his training activates and kills them using a spoon. He calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts (Stuart Greer) arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher (Walton Goggins) and Crane (Monique Ganderton), to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealer Rose (John Leguizamo). Mike becomes unnerved with his sudden array of military strategy and fighting skills. He also realises he has almost no memory of life before living in the town with Phoebe. Yates quarantines the city and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter's former assistant, Petey Douglas (Tony Hale), air drops her a weapon, and when Yates finds out he threatens to charge him for treason. Rose's house is attacked with lethal gas, Rose and his two guards, Big Harold (Lavell Crawford) and Quinzin (Sam Malone), are killed by two Toughguy agents, but Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers. Mike is rescued from the gas by Phoebe. He questions her knowledge of the gas, and Phoebe reluctantly reveals that she is a CIA agent assigned as his handler, leaving him heartbroken. After another attempt against his life, Mike is rescued by Lasseter. She explains that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. She also tells him that Phoebe was to leave after getting him settled in Liman but chose to stay because she genuinely fell in love with him. Lasseter reveals that his panic attacks about leaving town were implanted to keep him safe. Mike and Lasseter evade another attack by Toughguy agents, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey calls off the drone strike at the last minute, and secretly reports to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger (Bill Pullman). Mike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares, being a mentally unbalanced man. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her. Phoebe and Mike leave the store as multiple law enforcement officers show up with guns, and he decides to propose to her. Krueger ties up Yates and Lasseter. Yates argues what he was doing, even killing many innocent people, for good reasons. Yates is eventually executed by Krueger for his failure, while Lasseter argues that Mike taking out seventeen Toughguys is proof of the success of the Wiseman program and that he is potentially a valuable asset. Six months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are happy together in Manila, and ready to complete a CIA assignment. Also starring Michael Papajohn as Otis, and Nash Edgerton as Beedle. Eisenberg is interesting as the bewildered unmotivated young man who regains his memory as a high-skilled assassin, Stewart is alright as his loyal girlfriend, and Grace enjoys himself playing the villain. It was an interesting concept, the first half of the film establishing everything works relatively well, but then it gets a little too over-the-top than it probably should have done, to the point it is almost ridiculous and not that funny, at least the eye-catching violent fights and high-speed chases are reasonable, it could have been better, but it's not a bad action comedy. Okay!"

The antagonists motives make zero sense right from the beginning. A lot of things just don't seem realistic in many ways and sometimes motives even feel contradictory. Dialogue is often unnatural.But if you can let go of all the stuff that doesn't make sense and just watch it for what it is, a bizarrely fun action packed film, it makes for a good time.I found myself on the edge of my seat. It had this suspenseful feeling to it, and it had a nice subdued humor alongside it. The action was over the top but fun and exciting, even when
it didn't make sense. There were some genuinely interesting emotional moments as well, such as the talk with the car and the tree. It is one of those silly stoner logic moments, but as a metaphor it made sense.I hope this movie gets a sequel, because I think it deserves one, but it probably won't.This isn't my favorite movie ever, but it was enjoyable and I don't regret watching it at all. It feels like the kind of movie that would be based on a comic book, and whenever I get that kinda vibe from a movie it's almost a guarantee that I'll like it, but mileage may vary.I recommend it."

That kind of funThis may have made for a decent film, but not in this moronic cartoon version. Imagine this story without the way-over-the-top violence-if you are able-and it could have been something worthy of an adult audience. It could have been cool. Instead, it was completely stupid at almost every turn.Since it has an R rating, I'm assuming that the target audience isn't 12-year-old boys, that seems to be the age of the writer. Why do I think that the writer is 12? Because he thinks that if you one bullet, that is action, so if you shoot a few hundred bullets it's more action, action-packed. He doesn't seem to realize that the objective with shooting bullets is to hit people with the bullets. In several scenes people are shooting lots and lots of bullets without really trying to shoot anyone.Once again, you get the feeling that the writer has done nothing in life except watch movies and has no experience to draw on for creativity except crap from other movies. Bourne Identity mixed with every idiotic, post Tarantino shoot'em up."

He is hoping to propose to her during a holiday in Hawaii but has a panic attack at the airport... as he does every time he tries to leave town. After this incident he starts to wonder why Phoebe stays with him. We soon learn that he isn't an ordinary young man; he is part of a CIA programme known as 'Wiseman'... he doesn't know it but he is a highly trained super-soldier! Back at CIA headquarters Agent Victoria Lasseter, who headed the programme, is warned that all Wiseman agents are being eliminated by similar 'Tough Guy' agents run by rival agent Adrian Yates. She heads to West Virginia and meets Mike and gives him his activation code... he has no ideas what the words mean but shortly afterwards when he is attacked by two Tough Guys he dispatches them with a spoon! He still has no memory but he knows he must fight for his life to save himself and Phoebe as more agents come to kill him.This film is a bit silly but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun. There are quite a few humorous moments as well as plenty of action. It must be stated that the action is brutal to degree that might disturb some viewers. In many ways Mike is very like 'Jason Bourne'... an elite agent with memory problems; he is also very different as he doesn't know he has memory problems and Bourne didn't do drugs and draw comics. The story manages to provide some decent twists. The cast is solid; most notably Jesse Eisenberg who is a lot of fun as Mike... a character who is understandably confused when he realises he has elite combat skills. Kristen Stewart provides solid support as Phoebe. Topher Grace is good fun as villain Yates; he isn't a typical action movie villain... his character is far from tough.

Then of course hell breaks loose...I can't deny that i enjoyed watching this movie very much. It has a lot of problems though. For a movie that is marketed as a ''Action-Comedy'', there is definitely not enough comedy, there are some funny lines, but that's it. The action scenes are decent, just that. The premise of the movie is awesome and kind of fresh, the execution is average to OKEven though he isn't bad, i didn't like J.Eisenberg in this movie and he is definitely miscasted. Yeah he is convincing as an ordinary guy in the beginning, but afterwards he is totaly unbelievable as a awaken superspy, which ruins the immersion. In terms of acting the ladies steal the show here, both K.Stewart and C.Britton are and look great (which i find really surprising for Stewart, because i didn't like her in ''The Twillight Saga'' and especially in the otherwise masterfull ''Snowhite and the Huntsman''). T.Grace and W.Goggins (despite his character being annoyingly absurd) provide also great support and they seem to be having a lot of fun. B.Pullman shows up for something more than a cameo and he is cool as always. The script and the dialogue could have been incredibly better if they had try a little more. J.Leguizamo unfortunately is completely underused.

Jesse Eisenberg has a stoner and Kristen Stewart as a messed up rogue CIA agent/stoner is just about as good as it gets.Tony Hale is brilliant as always and Connie Britton is a hilarious badass.The big scene stealer for me is Walton Goggins as the mental patient/assassin.

Jesse Eisenberg does a great job portraying such a depressed chill character. Our protagonists' relationship is really sweet because it isn't outlandishly romantic but calming instead. The plot itself is creative and features some cool fights. Mike dealing with his new found abilities allows for funny moments when he turns into another person to a degree. The actions scenes are fun and the lighting gives the whole movie this gloomy but warm feel. Good movie to watch with an SO without being a rom-com."

A definitive cast with Jessie Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart leading the way as the catalyst for the film. When you add Walton Goggins, Topher Grace, Tony Hale, Bill Pullman, Connie Britton and John Leguizamo it makes a recipe for a pretty decent film. Eisenberg pulls off the slow stoner role perfectly but is actually a brainwashed secret agent created by the CIA.The fil begins rather slowly but soon picks up speed and becomes action filled with some silly dialogue mixed in. I went into the film with mild expectations and came away pleasantly surprised by the storyline as well as some of the performances."
" A Couragous Blend of Dramatic Action and Comedy
",0.3612,0.0307,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"28 August 2015. There are black comedies (The Whole Nine Yards, 2000; The Matador, 2005, You Kill Me, 2007; Red, 2010) and then there are black comedies (Pulp Fiction, 1994; Daisy & Violet, 2011; and Miss Meadows, 2014). American Ultra is one of the few that directly dare to put insidious murder and light hearted comedy together. Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart are given the arduous task of displaying witty humor in the most serious of dramatic obliterations of people. What some audience members might believe to be distasteful making light of the sinister cold-blooded destruction and mayhem on the screen, others might consider to be a bold and risky effort on film to find comedy in the most dire of situations. Taking the movie title (American Ultra) to task which isn't the most marketable of movie titles and which may have been a poor effort to refer to some mysterious, secret American program such as the top secret British Ultra Program during World War II that sought to decode cyphers during the war. Some might debate whether or not some of the fighting scenes might have been better choreographed around Bourne Identity (2002) action, yet for others the more obscure, less precise fighting scenes might also reflect a more real life experience instead. But the end result of American Ultra hopefully for some is a movie that courageously takes a sinister, psychotic but oddly enough narcissistic buffoon villain along with a serious dramatic action plot and laid over the light-hearted romantic yearnings of a small town couple, the male character who is living unbeknownst to him with a very draconian but amazing unique secret. New director Nima Nourizadeh is able to hold the dark drama together with the comedy in creating a most difficult but exhilarating move experience."

If you do stop you'll definitely see some issues; for example, the reason given to shut down the original program should still be a problem, but it's just ... not. That's so lazy.But as mindless fun goes, this is a really good example of it. It's also amusing with a surprisingly sweet romance at the heart of it.

The film is about stoner, Mike Howell, played by Jesse Eisenberg, as he struggles to understand his newly activated abilities as a sleeper agent as the CIA tries to kill him. Nothing he knows seems to make sense anymore including the love of his life, his girlfriend, Phoebe Larson played by Kirsten Stewart. This film made me relive the crazy undercover agent thoughts I had as a child because it has very silly, childlike storyline that proves to be entertaining.Though this film has an enjoyable story, I couldn't help but notice the visual effects were a little hit and miss. For example, all the explosions and blood on the actors appeared realistic, but some of the impact splatters looked amateur. It seems almost as if all the effects budget was spent on the explosions, but not enough was put toward the digital effects. If the audience can get past those minor miscues, this film is worth viewing."
" An action movie with just enough comedy to not take itself seriously

The story is without real suspense and has nothing we haven't seen before, but it doesn't matter.If this action movie was done with a serious tone, it would stink as it's not believable. But it was done with a light humor side, giving a comic book effect, without going too much into the absurd. You don't roll on the floor laughing, it just brings a smile on your face from time to time and that is perfect.At some point, the violence is very graphic, but I thought it was well done.It reminded me of TRUE LIES (1994) a little bit, but a little bit darker violence-wise.

Yes, it's a stoner comedy with all of the idiocy that premise brings to light, mixed with a gritty action thriller in the JASON BOURNE mould. I suppose it's only good for showing that any actor - even someone like Jesse Eisenberg - can be turned into a skilled martial artist with camera trickery and snappy editing. Sadly, although this film is gruesomely violent, the fights are disappointing and the plot is so silly as to be not worth mentioning. Add in the presence of Kristen Stewart - a detraction in any film in which she appears - and you have a film with simply isn't worth your time."

It occurred to me that, for the most part, folks have been trying to attach far too much cerebral value to what they have seen in the movie.It is what I choose to call ""chewing gum for the eyes"". It doesn't demand too much thought and is simply very entertaining. The leads performed excellently, and most of the other parts were played very well. The story-line is not overly complex, and I was easily able to dissociate it from ""Hanna"", which had a similar theme, but was rather more sophisticated.Thus, in summary, I have to say that this was a thoroughly entertaining movie which does not deserve some of the overblown bad criticism that others have made of it. Not the best that I've watched, but very far from being the worst."

Its not like the plot line is unique, granted. But what were they looking for, Bullit? Citizen Kane? The flick came short of a million on covering its costs with box office, so sadly there probably wont be a sequel. Good acting performances from Eisenberg and Stewart. Its worth the watch, I don't care what anybody else says."
" A really neat movie that goofed on a number of genres
",0.5563,0.9909,2017-07-14 00:00:00,7,"American Ultra is a play on the real UK Ultra program where the army tried to create a super soldier using mind control techniques, like LSD. I like these genre crossing movies. The secret agent who doesn't know he is a secret agent due to mind control then becomes activated is, ala ""Long Kiss Goodnight"", well trodden road. The evil government agency, the CIA in this case, sealing a town off for some nefarious purpose is also one of the motifs, ala the ""Crazies"". recycled. Stoner slacker guy, Mike Howell, with no middle class ambitions is a good all around comic relief character, played by Jesse Eisenberg with his devoted girl friend played by Kristen Stewart is a good pair. He works at a convenience store by himself ala ""Clerks"" and draws some silly comic about a super ape he hopes to get published. That duo made the movie, because neither of them are action hero types, quite the opposite for Jesse Eisenberg. He is a good character actor for the nerdy neurotic picked-on type, and a like-able sort of guy. Kristen Stewart is OK too, but she got a swelled head from all those vampire werewolf movies she starred in and got her rich. Then there is John Leguizmo who played his usual latino punk hustler role that was unimpressive. Topher Grace was good as the bad CIA agent who wanted to kill poor conditioned to not know who he really is Jesse, aka Mike Howell. Then they even had Walter Goggins replay his psycho killer role as a fellow American Ultra agent suitably named Laugher, he is a laughing psychopath. who was a psycho before he was put in the Ultra program. The over the top, impossible violent action scenes are no more excessive than the norm these days. To be honest, we can use less of that. But that is what brings in the crowds. The movie was nothing awesome but what made it good was that it had a soul thanks to the lead couple. It wasn't as good as ""Super"", which broker every movie conclusion convention, so it really doesn't rate camp-cult status. The ape cartoon interludes are interesting but sort of lame as well. But it is a pretty interesting and watchable flick and is much better than the comic book Marvel DC run of the mill product that this crosses genres with."

I had seen the trailers and knowing it starred the wonderfully charismatic Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart had kept me away. But it has remained on Netflix so my curiosity got the best of me.It's not terrible but perplexingly devoid of fun. Casting Jesse as a stoner sleeper agent seemed to be a opportunity for him to play against his usual type. But they never really do anything with it. He smokes pot, he does some fighting but not much. Most of the movie just plods along with a tremendous amount of exposition with other characters. Connie Britton is essentially a plot device and Topher Grace is the scrappy CIA guy trying to climb the ladder. He calls her a lot of names.This movie is quite violent which would be fine if they were going for dark comedy. But the tone comes across as just a straight up action movie. It never goes goofy enough to be a comedy or any over the top action to make it fun.Boring leads and a mostly boring plot. Topher Grace seems to be having fun but operates pretty far out of the tone of the rest of the movie. Overall this movie is bad without being bad enough to laugh at."

" A Satirical parody
",0.0,0.8485,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"Saw it last night on TV, and it did make me think. The plot is obviously silly and filled with huge holes and contradictions. But this is part of the territory of the sub-genre it so evidently parodies. That is the secret agent who was trained into a super human killing machine, combined with the damaged start. In a way it's a satirical version of La Femme Nikita, with hints toward Jason Bourne and The Long Kiss Goodnight.So, that's what the movie parodies, but if it didn't have any satirical aim, the whole thing would've been a waste of time money and talent, and if one misses the satire, that what one is left with. Well I find it to be a rather pointed satire of the Bureaucratic new attitude to spying, in which people are assets and life or death are simple side effects of managerial decision.The entire thing is a very tricky combination, since the plot is riddled with problems, as I already mentioned. But Jesse Eisenberg delivers a fantastic performance as the stoner who's a killing machine and doesn't know it. Topher Grace is also brilliant as a bureaucrat who got promoted into a position of power he doesn't understand, and still looks at the world as one big administrative system which bureaucracy can control and manage. The others perform their roles all right, but without Eisenberg and Grace the whole construction crumbles as a house of cards. With the two of them it's a fairly enjoyable experience."

I give it four stars because of one or two rare moments of interest."
" Very bizarre and not comedic
",-0.5928,-0.9497,2017-04-30 00:00:00,3,"American Ultra was a released and advertised as a type of stoner action-comedy, however it was not as comedic as lead to believe, but more so dramatic with plenty of violent action. Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, playing a couple whom we are to believe everything is fine between them, turns out for the worst while watching this film. Topher Grace plays the lead antagonist and he wasn't as believable and, acted as if he was still on a sitcom. He was miscast and not intimidating as the character was intended to be.American Ultra is quite a bizarre and weirdly film, where not much is explained and what is occurring happen very quickly,and all at once. There are brief twists along the way but for the most part, the film isn't entertaining or interesting enough. The trailers lead it believe this was another stoner comedy like Pineapple Express, but it is far from it. It is more like Hesher (starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but not as good, or even slightly similar to the Bourne films (in terms of plot wise) but also not as good. This film tries being more dramatic and emotional than needed and with the writing not being as great, we don't sympathize for the characters as we probably are supposed to. It takes itself too serious and that is a flaw. Sure there are action sets including shootouts, and fights, and some of which are quite bloody and disturbing but it isn't very good.Overall, American Ultra is not what it seemed to be as advertised, and it is lacking in general entertainment. The plot line is quite clever but the execution isn't great, and with better ideas, this movie could have been better and possibly a cult classic. Perhaps this film went through many edits and changes which is why the genres were somewhat all over the place."
" The Manchurian stoner....
",0.0,0.9911,2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"Stoner and slacker Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) spends his days getting high and writing comic books, but what he doesn't realise is that he is actually a sleeper agent who was part of an experiment by the CIA. When Howell is targeted for elimination by the CIA, his handler Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) decides to 'activate' him much to the annoyance of her colleague Adrian Yates (Topher Grace). With the CIA and their top agents hunting him down, Howell must use all of his skills to the best of his ability in order to survive...American Ultra is a mishmash of films with elements of The Manchurian Candidate, The Bourne films and practically every stoner comedy in existence. With the right handling this could have been great, but it's all rather ho-hum to be honest...I'm not generally a huge fan of stoner type comedies because often they are rather lazy and repetitive (there are some exceptions such as Harold and Kumar), and in this respect American Ultra is fairly weak as well. The stoner dialogue between Eisenberg and Stewart is lazy and uninspired and pretty dull - there's only so many times that you can hear words 'Dude' and 'Man' in the same sentence before it starts to become irritating. I presume the stoner aspect of Howell's life is the 'comedy' aspect of the film, but to me none of it was funny and as I mentioned it was more annoying than anything.Even taking out all of the lame stoner dialogue and focus on the story itself then the film still isn't that great; for a start I found that a lot of things here weren't very well explained or didn't make much sense. For example Howell is a sleeper agent and the CIA have targeted him for elimination and this seems to be based on the fact that Howell wants to leave the area?? Now presumably the reason for this is that the CIA may be worried about losing him or perhaps they want to keep an eye on him in case he somehow regains his memory (this is all speculation as nothing is really explained). I just didn't understand why he needed to be killed? Even if he moved out of the area, what difference would it make to the CIA as Howell didn't know he was part of an experiment nor did he know anything about his past life. Alternatively, if they wanted Howell to remain in the area why not put a directive or program in place to suppress his desire to leave? I know I'm throwing up a lot of scenarios and problems, but when a narrative is as vague as this one it feels as though you have to work everything out for yourself...Still it isn't all bad Eisenberg and Stewart make a likable enough couple (even though the former is annoying and is basically the same as he is in every film). Stewart on the other hand is much better; her performance is more natural and believable and she does give the picture a slight lift - also to her credit she didn't annoy me anywhere near as much as Eisenberg. The supporting cast are all OK, but I can't imagine that this film will really be the high point of anyone's career. That said though, some of the action sequences are pretty good and the film has just about enough energy to make it watchable, but when the chips are down there aren't enough funny moments for the 'comedy' aspect of the film to work and the narrative is a little vague and isn't interesting enough to make it a particularly involving experience. It passes the time, but that's about it."
