" Worst movie I've ever watched!!!
",-0.7163,-0.956,2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"There is a reason i tend to avoid commercial Bollywood movies and this one is probably one of the worst from this industry!
A Casteist, mysoginistic and backwards storyline, with illogical movie twists combined with awful actors. I was shocked to see, that this movie conveys so many wrong messages for example that you can be only be considered as attractive if you fulfil certain beauty standards. At no point in this terrible movie the importance of your character and personality was highlighted.
Secondly the movie potrays wrong ideals of relationships and support abusive behaviour. Best example here is the sister of the protagonist, who wants urgently to marry her bf, hence pressurizing her own sister to find herself a bf as soon as possible, eventhough she isnt even ready to marry. And instead of walking out of her obviously toxic relationship( a men, who wants to leave you because you cant marry him as he wish to is certainly the wrong one!) she turns against her sister and abuses her mentally.Where is your decency and pride to turn against your own flesh& blood?!
So this movie is wrong on so many levels and iam honestly devastated, that such Kind of movie are being made."
" Touching my heart
",0.0,0.9857,2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"I am not a deadbeat fan of overly emotional movies. But this one was successful in keeping me nailed to the seat till the end. These young new faces are beautiful and good at acting. I wish I could cuddle with them sometime in an awesome threesome (only if they are up for it ; ). I have come to point in life where I could say that its wonderful to watch these young lovers and their drama on the screen. I wish I could see this movie alone, once and for all weep my ass out of the burden of being involved in a love triangle as in Inder, Sarasota, Abhimanyu. Theater is not the place where I would want to embarrass myself with tears. But it would be a wonderful catharsis if one could watch it and let it all out."

It's more than a movie to me‚ù§, I loved Harshavardhan the most in itüòå"
" Love comes in many shades
",0.6369,0.9861,2020-07-16 00:00:00,7,"What worked:
the story is beautiful; a love story filled with many ups and downs, twists and turns. It's a package for a Bollywood romantic movie. It's sad at times and joyful at other. Overall a movie about love that was intended to transcend the ethics and welcome love. Watching it with your lover keeps you attached and emotional.What did not work:
screen time; it's a long movie which needed necessarily to be cut down by a huge chunk. The scenes are repetitive, overbearing, long and theoretically emotional. I would have cut down the songs plus many scenes in the second half.overly done; the melodrama and the emotional setting in the second half of the movie is so persistent that you feel like you are watching an Indian soap opera. It drags the scenes, situations and emotions, ultimately makes you sad not by the movie narrative but also by the mood and gloominess of the scenes. It's like an ideal love story written for the best seller.Final verdict: watch it with your lover alone, if not you will be overly disoriented by this movie"
" Music & Screenplay are perfectly synced
",0.6369,0.4473,2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Since the music notes hit the right chords at the right time , maybe that's why it doesn't feel like just another stupid romantic movie , but feels special !"

" Absolute delight..
",0.0,0.9026,2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,"From the very start, you know this movie is something other than the regular Bollywood story.
The story, music, background scores, performances everything is to the point.
I don't remember if any other movie actor has spoken that South Indian accent so natural like Saru's father does. Every single performance is up to the mark no matter how small the role is.
Music and lyrics are cherry on the cake.
Both lead actors best suit the role.
Murali Sharma (the inspector), Sudesh Berry (Inder's father) , Manish Choudhary (Saru's father) all do fab jobs in their roles.
A loveable watch."
" ""Spoiler Alert"" Another sad, romantic story
",0.2023,0.6369,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"Well directed film. Focuses on subtle aspects of life. Saru, a girl from a conservative background and Inder an understanding, dynamic guy from a broadminded background is a lawyer by profession drowned in his own problems. It pans out in such a way that a romantic relation starts between them. However Saru's parents being orthodox saraswat brahmins disown her and subsequently Inder's girlfriend also throws tantrums and ditches him. This film is packed with romance, suspense and drama to keep the watchers engaged for two and a half hours, overall a solid 8 out of 10."

" Fabulous love story
",0.8225,0.9945,2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"The film has so many wonderful scenes capturing each of the emotions so well. This is all about a girl who hides her outer beauty and goes unnoticeable by many, for her old fashioned clothes.Suddenly due to few circumstances she comes across a guy who finds her beauty and lets the world see her beauty with an amazing makeover with a series of actions took place.For this you have to watch the film,which is why I'm trying to keep ot suspenseful.
Now talking about the movie,the best thing is HARSHAVARSHANRANE acting, who's really the backbone for being the heartthrob for the film.The way he looks at her with immense love in his eyes,and although being impatient and violent as known,he tends to be so patient and cool enough with the girl not denying any of her urges since the beginning.Slowly with the track,girl realising the love for each other is fabulous than ever.This love track between them worked out quite well.No words to describe about the actress.
Other best part is giving the important message is how much ever parents may act cruel,at the end of the day they definitely would strive for us.This aspect was shown by an unexpected arrogant father.This movie seriously leaves you with teary eyes and it would take a lot of time to come out of this beautiful world."

I loved both their characters in the movie. The movie just touches your heart. The actress here is Pakistani and we might not see her again because of the new law of not hiring Pakistani women in Bollywood. There is one reason i'm not giving it a 10 is because i think the directors could have changed the plot in certain areas to make viewers more happy (when you watch it you will know what i am talking about)
" Audio edit badly done
",-0.4767,-0.0196,2017-09-03 00:00:00,6,The movie is too good but the worst part is its background score which actually did not let the dialogues clearly audible. so -2 rating for that. The entire dialogue sequences were not clear just because of the background music being too loud. The colors used by the cinematographer were exceptionally good.
" Must Watch Movie
",0.0,0.2564,2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"I really don't like romantic movies, just hate how they are always using clich√© story line, dialogue etc. I watched this movies cause of the trailer and the songs. This movie was really really good, the acting was superb especially Harshvardhan Rane he was just awesome. If you like romantic movies or not YOU SHOULD REALLY WATCH THIS ONE!!!"
" One of the best movies of 2016
",0.6369,0.9594,2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of 2016. Loved the movie, Both the actors have played their part very well. Both have a great future in bollywood. you will never feel like these actors are doing debut, they are matured actors.I recommend this movie and I feel like this movie deserve better box office record."
" Best Bollywood Love Story I have Seen In Years!
",0.8655,0.9951,2017-06-15 00:00:00,10,"I love Sanam Teri Kasam and have watched it multiple times with the same result; tears and sympathy for the young lovers Saru and Inder. I thought the story was well written-certainly better than most of the hokey, nonsensical stories being written and passed off as Bollywood love stories today. The acting was strong, and Harsha and Mawra have gained many new fans as a result of this film. The music was memorable and enhanced the scenes, thoughts, and actions of the characters in this movie. I commend the writers and directors of the film for having the courage to deal honestly with social issues that are still occurring for some girls.I loved the fact that Inder was the strong, devastatingly handsome, silent type, like Heathcliff from the Bronte classic, Wuthering Heights, and Saru, although under a cloud from the beginning of the movie was along with Inder, one of the most unforgettable characters in this film. Harsha Rane's intensity and Mawra's beauty combined with their impressive acting skills will undoubtedly take them far. I wish them both the best."
" Not a good one at all
",-0.3412,-0.0433,2017-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting, bad story line. This is how the whole movie can be summed up. I went forward to watch this movie after seeing a 7 rating on IMDb. Thank Goodness I did not waste my money to go and watch this in the theaters, I would have wasted both my money and my time then. I do not know how other viewers have given it a perfect rating, I am guessing either they have not watched a movie before, or it's a fake one. IMDb please do not display such fake reviews, it gives the customer an incorrect notion about the movie in question. Seriously, great movies get a 6.5 plus rating here, this movie can never come in the category."
" Great Love Story
",0.8519,0.9673,2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful love story of Inder and Saru which leaves you teary and a soft corner for the characters cause of its simplicity and performance. One of the best emotional love stories. If you are a love story fan, then it is must watch. The movie also portrays other relationships in a beautiful and more wanting nature. Great performance by the leading girl but the boy could have done a much better role, only a little bit though."
" Well-Acted, But Overtly Tragic!
",-0.6476,0.7876,2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"Director Duo Radhika Rao-Vinay Sapru's 'Sanam Teri Kasam' is a well-acted, well-shot film, that's bogged down by an overdose of tragedy. Sure, tragedies can be engaging & can break your heart if done right , but when its forced upon you almost throughout the narrative, it appears overdone. And that's where this film falters.'Sanam Teri Kasam' Synopsis: After being disowned by her family, an awkward librarian relies on the help of her brooding neighbor.To begin with, the girl protagonist Saraswati ""Saru"" Parthsarthy (played beautifully by Mawra Hocane), is the most doomed person on earth. I mean, seriously. Can't this pretty girl have a few fun moments in a 151-minute film? The Writers hand her with realistic problems, but tragedy knocks her down scene after scene. Initially you feel for her & even root for the Hero protagonist, Inder Parihaar (a superb Harshvardhan Rane), but after a point, you're just tired! She's disowned by parents who are from the time of the dinosaurs, bullied by her co-workers & also gets close to no attention from her boss. But that's not all. The girl continues to battle life throughout, until she even loses it. Radhika Rao-Vinay Sapru have Directed the film well & even Chirantan Das's Cinematography is well-done. But the Writing doesn't support. While the film begins very well & has some cute moments in the first-hour, the second-hour just doesn't engage much. Even the final-act drags for a long time. A better Screenplay & less sadness, would've done wonders! A Special Mention for Himesh Reshammiya's Fantastic Score.Both the actors, Mawra & Harshvardhan justify their roles & display confidence. They have potential, but it needs to be tapped in a better written film. Of the supporting cast, Murli Sharma & Vijay Raaz leave a mark.On the whole, 'Sanam Teri Kasam' has its moments, but not enough to make up for its flaws."
" Heart touching Movie
",0.0,0.9538,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"one of the best romantic movie after aashiqui 2. surely it would have been a huge hit if it had any big name. though the newcomers Mowra and harsh did their job splendidly.good story,direction,actors,music and songs.but the Bollywood runs on Fanfare.sadly it went unnoticed.special mention for the directors work. each and every scene is interesting.the chemistry between the lead actors is adorable.mowra is such a beautiful talent.unfortunately,we may not see her work in another Indian movie due to cheap politics of MNS and Shivsena. plz watch this movie with ur loved ones."
" Intense movie. Clearly audience beg to differ with critics
",0.2023,0.9925,2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"This is one movie where critics say ""no way"". But audience ""absolutely love it"". One of the most intense movies I have ever seen. Great acting and dialogues. You definitely would cry while watching it. Good direction and cinematography. Great songs and BG score. This movie should have done great.Started this movie at 1:20 am and I was so into the movie that it's almost 4:00 and here I'm writing review.I just don't write lengthy reviews. (ignore)Feels slow for one who doesn't feel the movie. Hero is good. Heroine is also good. Couldn't even stop at title because of the soundtrack."
" An overlong, dragging tragic story
",-0.4588,0.8625,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"The title of the film reminds of an 80s film of the same title which has been remembered for its songs. But this film has nothing to do with 80s ""Sanam Teri Kasam."" Instead it resembles some hits like ""Love Story"" (1970) or ""Prem Geet""(1981) destined for a tragic end. But you don't get fully soaked in the emotions of this film due to its entangled narrative, unlovable characters, and its over length. The beauty of the film remains only in a sparse through a decent performance by its debut actress, few song numbers and the pleasant colors used in its backdrop. For me it was a slight, passable movie which drags for the rest of your two hours.Rating: 1 star out of 4"
