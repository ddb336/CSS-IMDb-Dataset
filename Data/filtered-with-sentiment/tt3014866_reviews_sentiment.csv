" High-concept takes a deep dip
",0.0,-0.9874,2021-04-09 00:00:00,3,"We're introduced to a CIA operative (Ryan Reynolds) as he picks up a black bag full of money, a gun and a new passport. As this is happening he gets a call from his wife; we learn we're supposed to like this guy. Next he gets chased. Then he dies.But wait! What at first seemed like an average action flick now takes a different turn. This flick is high concept... or so we were told. What is promoted as the ""high concept"" of this thriller, is in fact no more than an excuse to stretch the runtime of this movie to almost two hours. It is also far from inventive, but far fetched and slightly ridiculous: they put the memories of the dead operative into the brain of a death row inmate played by Kevin Costner. So after a redundant operation scene, followed by an excess of scenes where Costner is figuring out what's happening to him, the movie that started as an fast moving espionage flick becomes a gritty, dawdling, Bourne-Identity-meets-You-Were-Never-Realy-Here movie.Now, I'm in for mindless action and I'm also down for gritty human drama's, but if you're going to mix the two it should at least be done in a way that fits the tone. And if you really want to glue the two together with over the top science fiction, then make an over the top movie and not one with an overly serious tone.The biggest problem this movie has, however, is the fact that it takes half the runtime for us to even be introduced to what's really at stake. The fact that there is both a personal ánd an international plot unraveling doesn't help and makes us wonder why we should feel any tension at all. Why were we rooting for Costner again? Oh, that's right, he's playing the bad guy that is discovering his nice side. Super high-concept...The technical execution of the movie (camera, lighting, special effects...) is decent, yet average. The score is dreadfully dull and the cast is horribly wasted to dialogues of little importance. A criminal waste of time and money."
" Hard to rate the film, but Kevin Coster's acting is a ten.
",-0.0516,-0.3551,2021-03-30 00:00:00,7,"I won't say much about the film. Sort the reviews by helpfulness and you in about will get my opinion. I will only say as much: After reading the cast list I expected something less ... bland? I can't actually put my finger on it. There is less of Tommy Lee Jonas and Gary Oldman than one would like, but they're aptly cast and show the good performances you'd expect from them. But I want to point your attention to Costner's acting. If I told you in advance what kind of character he plays, you would expect something familiar from experience - but it's not exactly what you get. Costner does much more with the role than expected. His character is multi-faceted: A mixture between brutal animal, a bit of a mentally challenged person and some traits he 'inherits' through the film's core procedure. And Costner knows what to do with that. He brings the torn character to screen in a gripping way. There is more to the usual Costner deadpan approach we know from whenever he doesn't play the nice guy. Watch closely, you won't be disappointed."

",0.4404,0.7672,2021-02-04 00:00:00,6,"Kevin Costner is the heart of the film. His recovery from a deranged psychopathy into an emotional caring person is the hallmark of the film. His mental state and it's gradual evolution is something that the actor and also film manages perfectly.
The rest of the film is made just joining these pieces to make a edge of the seat thriller, something which it does not do very well. there are too many plot holes, too many stupid scenes and logic defying decisions by the director as well as the writer.But, at the end of it, I wouldn't say I have wasted my time watching this. But it could have been much much better."

The movie mostly has to have it from Kevin Costner, that did what we are used of him by now, a good performance. I don't think I ever saw him acting badly. The rest of the cast all contributed to make Criminal an easy to follow action thriller with a touch of sci-fi. There are a couple cheesy moments, but not that important to ruin the movie. It's easy entertainment and sometimes that's just what we need."

However, i rate films based on how effective i think they are given a filmmaker's intentions. So, I cannot rate a movie that I find enjoyable because of the missteps of it's producers in the same vein as something like ""Vertigo"". That being said, this movie is enjoyable as a comedy, with Costner's performance, the absurdly odd moral ambiguity of Godot and Costner's chemistry, the hilarious story, and amazing performances by Oldman, and Jones, who clearly have not real idea what kind of picture this is, creating something unique."

" Great example of Hollywood in a microcosm....
",0.6249,-0.9235,2021-01-04 00:00:00,2,"This movie typifies and exemplies everything wrong with Hollywood......ie that it keeps churning out utter garbage ad nauseum and public feeds on it. Public fuels precisely these type of movies to perpetuate.It is sad as despite the trite and cliche done-to-death plot of Manchuarian Candidate meets Face Off meets Jason Bourne (read: a sorry smorgarsbord) Tommy Lee Jones gave solid performance as did Gary Oldman. Kevin Costner wasn't that bad, but his gruff voice and grunt was just overdone and not likeable. Gal Gadot was great as a side actress role.Problem weren't the cast nor the performances but the utter drivel that writers, producers, directors and the entire production unit that comes up with. It's almost freestyled script probably sloppily written under a day and there was absolutely no plot tension and an uncessary character of a Dutchman as well as a stock villain of poor man's Javier Bardem as the antagonist.How long do we have to endure Hollywood churning out these type of trash and garbage one after another? If y'all bored and got no creative impulse, then maybe it is time to take a break instead of treating art as a fast-buck making industry - because that is essentially what movie going experience has become: a giant pop-corn flick inducing fast-foodization of cinema."
" star studded. good drama.
",0.4404,0.899,2020-12-18 00:00:00,7,"That's a pretty star-packed cast.. the top four guys in the cast list. Costner, Oldham, Jones, Reynolds. can't get more testosterone than that in one film. so they take the memories from CIA agent Pope (Reynolds) and implant them into agent Stewart (Costner) so he can carry on the mission. they need to find the dutchman (Michael Pitt) before he can activate missiles against the U.S. although now that people know he has the security codes to the US systems, even more people are after him. just europe and russia. the usual spy chase. and someone is shooting off missiles from a sub out at sea. the strange part is that he also feels the emotions that Pope felt for Pope's own wife. but she's not Stewart's wife. it's pretty good. some twists and turns. directed by ariel vromen. has directed seven films."

And a horrible version of a song from the UK band the foals to add some London feeling to it. And more violence and unclear story line and mumbling conversations and some more mumbling and screaming. Just a trainwreck, I didn't like it. My god."
" Frantic action in search of a plausible plot
",-0.4404,-0.9836,2020-12-06 00:00:00,4,"This is a mix of sci-fi and today's world, and it simply does not work. The basic premise of being able to read a dead man's memory is ingenious, but simply not plausible. I might have accepted it if they had read the memory from a dying man. Buit this, superimposed on action that takes place in today;s Britain, is just the first problem with the plot. It might have worked if i had been set a decade or two in the future.So what is the problem with the plot? It must have been written by an American, because it has all the American cliches about the British police; that they are unarmed, slow and stupid. Puhleez. The script expects us to believe that a private company can send armed killers who hose the unwanted with submachine guns. Cone on. A burst of automatic fire, and the rapid response unit would be out there in a matter of minutes, armed to the teeth. As usual, a killing here or there gets no reaction from the police, and of course nobody thinks of ringing up the police if they are in danger.The plot is actually more in the James Bond league, with a ""out hero saves the world"" schtick that is a cyberwarfare version of Thunderball. Some hacker has found out how to launch nuclear missiles from various locations, even from a submarine. (Face palm) Uh, no.The film has a stellar lineup and great acting. The direction is good, if somewhat routine. There is an awful lot of deja vu in most action films, and this is unfortunately no exception. In short; a pity about the plot."

Not even the US president can do that. It takes 2 officers to manually launch a nuke with separate keys only after they receive a verified code from the president. So while the idea of implanting a dead man's memories into a living person is intriguing...the idea of a hacker remotely launching US nukes is a total joke."

" Great cast but otherwise nothing new
",0.3716,0.989,2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Directed by Ariel Vromen this 2016 film has a runtime of 113 minutes and has a cast of A-List Hollywood player to delight. On it's release this film received extremely mixed reviews; some calling it a dark cult classic, while others suggesting it is just an updated version of the 1997 John Travolta and Nicolas Cage cult classic ""Face/Off"", or other body swap sci-fi films.Brief plot:
The memories of a killed CIA operative are put into the brain of a criminal in order to stop World War 3.Detailed plot:
CIA operative Bill Pope is killed in the line of duty while trying to track down shadowy hacker, ""The Dutchman"". Using an experimental procedure Pope's memories are transferred into the head of dangerous convict Jericho Stewart.Stewart begins his mission with Pope's memories leading the way, but things get complicated, especially when the memories get more powerful and more real. Considering Pope's knowledge of America's Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles he becomes a target for the CIA as well as the anarchists he was supposed to be stopping.Film Stuff:
This action thriller was mainly filmed in the centre of London, but some scenes were filmed in Hampshire, Croydon and Surrey too. Written by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg, with cinematography by Dana Gonzales and editing by Danny Rafic. Haim Mazar was initially signed up to do the musical score, but was replaced by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.A budget of $31.5 million mean that this was never going to be a big budget blockbuster, but instead a more character driven film. Unfortunately, with global box-office takings at $38.8 million this film was seen as a commercial flop.Cast:
With Kevin Costner, Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman heading the casting, you've already got some real big hitters in this film. They all do a decent job, but then, director Vromen seems to have the entire cast bringing convincing performances. Costner is the real stand out here, starting fairly empty and void of life he grunts his ways through a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings until he convinces us that he's a changed and learned character. It's a nice ark of character development as his dangerous persona feels love and family and ends the film a different person from what he started.Wrap up:
This film was OK, but just OK rather than anything special. With other sci-fi action films having similar plots where there is some kind of a body swap the concept in this film is nothing new. Lot of action with plenty of violence and bloodshed doesn't save a bland script and unoriginal story with lots of plot holes. The best thing this film has going for it really is the stellar cast of actors who all do a decent job with what they have been given. Rated 15 in the UK and R in the USA, this film certainly isn't for the younger audiences. Like I said, it was OK, but that all really, nothing new, nothing revolutionary, nothing that's going to leave a permanent mark on the face of Hollywood films. At best, this is a 6 out of 10."
" quite a good B-movie
",0.4927,-0.991,2020-09-28 00:00:00,6,"'Criminal', Ariel Vromen's 2016 film is an interesting combination that, depending on the expectations and the mood of the viewers, can disappoint or be a pleasant surprise. It is a spy film based on a science-fiction idea that is not developed in depth, a rather violent action film that fits the B-Movie label. The cast brings together on screen a collection of well-known actors with fame in Hollywood or in the UK. All do their jobs in an exemplary manner, but the exclamation 'what a waste of talent!' was probably heard many times at the exit of the screening halls. The story is quite interesting, but the rules of films of this genre do not allow or allow time to add too much substance to the psychological profiles of the characters. The film, being well acted and impeccably made technically, manages to arouse and keep the interest of most viewers, but I failed to avoid a dose of regret for an artistic potential, less commercial but more interesting, which seemed insufficiently exploited .'Criminal' begins as an espionage action movie, with a by-the-book chase on the streets of London ending in the violent death of a CIA agent. Here starts the element of science fiction, as his memory is transplanted through an experimental process into the brain of Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), a murderer sentenced to life in prison, the kind of Hannibal Lecter. If the pretext seems thin, you can console yourself by learning that scientific experiences with the transfer of the memory of the dead and are quite advanced, although the transfer is made on other physical media than living persons brains. Returning to the film, the stakes of the procedure are not only a suitcase with a large sum of money, but also access to nuclear activation codes. In a short time, the inmate will be free on the streets of London, pursued by espionage agencies and criminal organizations, and in addition to full doubling of personality, with his criminal instincts overlapping the memories and feelings of the dead agent.The formula works very well and the result is one of the B-movies that I was not at all sorry to see. Ariel Vromen shoots professionally, and the script follows all the rules of action movies. Kevin Costner has the opportunity to be cast in a complex and interesting role. He is an actor who in my opinion has received undeserved criticism, and perhaps this role is the beginning of a come-back, he succeeds well excepting slight exaggerations of physical pain. Tommy Lee Jones as the doctor who invented and leads the memory transfer and Gal Gadot as the wife of the murdered agent manage to make their roles credible and even memorable characters, with the little material at hand. I can't say the same about Gary Oldman, the only one who deserves the 'wasted acting talent' cliché. Could this movie have said more? I believe so, the reason being that the doubling of the personality as a result of the memory transfer could have been written differently and developed in more depth. But this would probably have happened at the expense of the action part, and then the fans of the genre to which the film is targeted would have complained. I hope that at least these would be satisfied."

" A big disappointment!!!!

The movie is one of the most forgettable movie I've ever seen. Despite of some of the great talent of Hollywood the movie is real trash.Acting is a major disappointment despite of having stars like Costner, Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Costner is suffering from headache in major part of the movie due to brain surgery which resulted in mine headache, Oldman was running like a headless chicken in the whole movie and I felt that I should also run leaving the movie midway. Tommy Lee Jones was also wasted, other cast was equally disappointed. Screenplay is bad and gets slow, direction is bad and the climax doesn't impresses much.My humble suggestion would be to watch the movie without having any sort of expectation and off course without using your brain."
" Flawed but still excellent, highly recommended
",0.8266,0.9461,2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"Let's get the bad out of the way right here: the CIA station chief played by Gary Oldman is such an impulsive idiot that not even Gary Freaking Oldman can make the character credible. It's that bad.Just about everything else works very well though once you give the story the necessary free pass on its one impossible thing, the mind transference gimmick. In a supporting role Tommy Lee Jones is in Sympathetic Good Man mode, which he can do in his sleep better than any other actor wide awake, Costner proves that when he's being an actor instead of a Star he can put in an amazingly good performance, and everybody else, including the ruthless bad guy who nonetheless cares enough for his henchwoman to give her a pass when any other villain would have played the ""You have failed me for the last time"" card, and the terrified fugitive super-hacker who created and is carrying around the film's Maguffin, a piece of software code that makes whoever has it armageddon-capable, is good.(There's a wonderful little bit where Costner's character, still integrating the Reynolds character's memory, meets the bad guy unexpectedly, and says, as if recognizing a guy he saw at the pub the other day, ""You're the guy who killed me,"" to which the villain replies approvingly ""Good memory."")There's also a mid-air explosion that's so aesthetically beautiful that I stopped the film and watched it three times in a row, and I don't know what Alice Eve looks like when she gets up in the morning in real life, but backed by Hollywood make-up artists here she's unnaturally beautiful enough to play Aphrodite herself.Trivia note: this was Ryan Reynolds' second mind-transfer movie in two years: here he plays the donor; in 2015's ""Self/Less"" (also very good) he was the recipient."

" Arbitrariness is the big problem
",-0.4019,-0.9767,2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,"In this tale of a sort of virtual memory transplant from brain to brain, the main character steps into a situation that's a little more complicated than we're accustomed to. It's the good guys versus the bad guys but with a renegade bad guy in addition who's just as dangerous as anyone else. I'm not sure why that complication was necessary, but it's not the picture's big problem. The big problem is that the scriptwriters have decided the memory transplant is kind of imperfect, maybe even kind of temporary, and they manipulate the degree of its effectiveness in order to help drive the plot. Since there's no such thing as a brain-to-brain memory transplant, there's no way to disguise the ups and downs of the result as anything realistic rather than arbitrary manipulation of the plot and thus of the audience. As others have said, though, the film is watchable thanks to its other qualities."

",0.4404,0.5187,2019-10-18 00:00:00,3,"Worthy concept offers compelling blend of sci-fi, action, & thriller, but an over complicated plot - coupled with Costner's bold, yet odd, character choices - yields numerous narrative missteps & a laughable epilogue."
" It's NOT LIKE Faceoff!!!!!
",-0.5887,-0.9933,2019-10-09 00:00:00,8,"This is really annoying. ""Faceoff"" was a story about guys having their appearance changed to look like someone else, so they could pretend to be them. ""Criminal"" is about taking the residual memories from a dead guy and putting them in a live guy so they could learn what the dead guy knew and had done. What do these two stories having in common?? Nothing. If you must compare it to another movie, try Source Code (memories of a dead guy put in another deadish guy) or Star Trek Wrath of Kahn (Spock puts part of his conciousness in Bones). People who compare Criminal to Faceoff apparently failed to get the gist of either movie.
I really liked Criminal even though I'm not a big fan of in-your-face brutal violence. Costner does a great job of portraying a criminal psychopath who has zero concept of right and wrong. Badguy Jordi Molla and his girlfriend Antje Traueare are psychopaths who want to destroy governments . The supposedly good guy government agents are pretty brutal on their own. It's great fun watching Kevin Costner switch from unbridaled random viciousness to specific viciousness directed against the bad guys. Tommy Lee Jones was a decent, out of his usual character meekish doctor/scientist. Gal Gidot shows that she can do a hell of a lot of acting just by changing her expression. The kid was cute. This movie takes you on a wild ride from the depths of cruelty to the heights of love and caring, with a nice little twist near the end. The biggest downers for me was that Gary Oldman's character was just too repetitiously stupid to be believable and bad guys having no trouble tracking an experienced agent thru a busy crowed city. Other than that 8 of 10."
" Excellent American action movie
",0.5719,0.7425,2019-10-08 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this - simple plot, no character development except for Jericho's sci-fi change, lots of violence, clearly defined badies and goodies. No sarcasm intended, it catered well to my (obviously still 13-year old) tastes.
If you're in for a night of unsophisticated entertainment with good acting and lots of action sequences, this is a winner."
" If you haven't seen this one, it's worth a look
",0.2263,0.9008,2019-10-06 00:00:00,8,"As I looked at the cover of the DVD of this movie, I was surprised that I had never heard of this 2016 film starring Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds in a smaller role. I was pretty much expecting that it would be a boring star vehicle type of movie, but it was definitely not, due to the excellent acting and overall quality and atmosphere of this film.The story begins with the transplanting of memories and emotions from a dead CIA agent's (Ryan Reynolds) brain into the brain of a death row prisoner (Kevin Costner). While a procedure such as this is still a bit far fetched, this movie actually pulls it off and makes it believable.Kevin Costner's excellent acting is a huge reason that this movie works. As I watched this movie, several times I had to remind myself that this was Kevin Costner: he completely fused himself with the character of Jericho.Filmed in and around London, this movie has the feel of an intense foreign-made thriller, but with popular American actors.I have no idea how this movie was marketed when it was released, but maybe that has something to do with it's relative obscurity and low box office.Criminal is a very good movie worth viewing, even if like myself, you didn't even know it existed."
" Never was a film more aptly named
",0.0,-0.9939,2019-09-21 00:00:00,5,"There are many guilty pleasures that can be gained from watching movies throughout your life. Moments that you want to go back to even within a dense calamity either side of those moments. Criminal doesn't provide many of them. There are jaw dropping moments but for all of the wrong reasons, not least why the screenwriters guild didn't have lawsuits pending for the levels of 'been there done that - better' that resulted from this film.There are moments of incredulity in this film which just confirm that sometimes actors just suck in their chests and pay the mortgage. This cast deserves better than what was presented to them. Saying that I like the tosh that screenwriter Cook served up in The Rock and Double Jeopardy. Here though, whether it was the inability of the Director or the lesser budget (Double Jeopardy was hardly a blockbuster) Criminal is a painful watch.In his youth Oldman played a number of crazy guys - Romeo is Bleeding,Leon - and clearly Costner used these as his template for this performance. I'm not exactly sure what template or method Oldman centered for his own performance here. The mainly British cast is given the job of playing the CIAs finest, all with the kind of American accents which when reversed annoys me as a Brit.And then there's Tommy Lee Jones. Poor Tommy. He plays his role as a man who is more concerned with managing his haemorrhoids as his emotions are a mixture of pain, pain and thoughts of getting a new agent.The set up that Costner has a spare space in his cerebral to take the memories of a dying CIA agent - Ryan Reynolds, cleverly exiting early enough from the mess - is Brain/Off rather than Face/Off. The clumsy chase through London and the British countryside and Costner's softening from hardened crim to almost family man in the space of 48 hrs is, criminal. The pay off between reformed bad guy and truly awful, I mean really awful as in poorly developed, bad guy is like opening a flat bottle of cola, even after you've shaken it for ten minutes.I gave it 5 stars mainly for the stunts and the decent performance by Gal Gadot. This is my first cinematic experience of her and she handled her role far better than others in this criminal fiasco seemed to care.Look elsewhere if you really want to be entertained."
" That's how a movie should be
",0.0,0.9887,2019-09-17 00:00:00,8,"A most efficient CIA agent is killed on a mission. He is also happens to be the most lovable family man who loves his wife and daughter. A very important information is about to go out of CIA's hands with him. Panicked, the CIA recruits a doctor who promised to ""push"" his memory into some other suitable person. Unfortunately, that 'suitable"" person is a criminal who is literally uncontrollable.However, when the memory is punched into him, he starts to change. And events follow.Superb movie. With action, thrill, tension, love, commitment, affection, sci-fi, and above all acting. Each of the casts are brilliant in their respective roles including Gal Gadot, Tommy Lee Jones, Jordi Mollà and Gary Oldman. But this movie is out and out about superb acting by Kevin Costner. May be one of his best performances.Few things you got to ignore though. Like a little man Heimdahl with his single laptop could control and change anything while the whole CIA team cannot. He reaches to the spot much earlier than the CIA team every time. Many decisions of Quaker does not make any sense - for example releasing Jerico multiple times and go after him again realizing his blunder.Anyways, those are minor holes lost in a great flick. Satisfies every taste bud of yourself. The conflicts happening inside of Jerico perfectly portrayed by Costner. Jordi Mollà did great as the icy terrorist. Gary Oldman always shines in these kind of roles as CIA chief or something. Cameos of Tommy Lee Jones and Gal Gadot couldn't be better. Finally, the emotions overpowering the beast of Jerico makes you believe about love and family.In the end, you will feel that's how a movie should be."
" Criminal
",-0.5267,-0.9978,2019-09-01 00:00:00,3,"In The Ricky Gervais Show, Karl Pilkington described a movie pitch, with a character having another character's brain put into their head, so that they can have their memories and thoughts, this idea was hilariously ridiculous, but in fact, it came true(!), it is essentially exactly what happens in this movie, directed by Ariel Vromen (The Iceman). Basically, Jan Strook (Michael Pitt), a hacker known as ""the Dutchman"", has discovered that industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà) has created a wormhole program to bypass and access computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defence codes. CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) gets him to a safe house and gives him the money for his services. But Pope is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman. Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's supervisor Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) contacts Dr. Micah Franks (Tommy Lee Jones), who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memories of a dead person into a living one. They find convict Jerico Stewart, a remorseless killer with no emotional development that resulted in a childhood accident, and Franks requests that they ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into his. After the operation, Jerico escapes custody and fakes his death. He goes to Pope's house, where he holds Pope's widow Jillian ""Jill"" (Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot) hostage while he looks for the money. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can remember is the bag of money but cannot identify where it or the Dutchman are being kept. The Dutchman believes he has been betrayed by the CIA, they learn he is planning to sell the program to the Russians. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks. Jerico is beginning to develop emotions and draw on Pope's experience. While Jerico tries to retrace Pope's steps to find the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Wells' attention, allowing Heimdahl's accomplice and lover Elsa Mueller (Antje Traue) to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge. Jerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jill and explains the situation to her. She is fearful of him initially but comes to accept Jerico as she sees him bonding with her daughter, Emma (Lara Decaro), and allows him to stay the night. The next morning, after a conversation with Jill, Jerico realises that the bag is hidden at the University of London but is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa after finding it. Heimdahl threatens to kill Jill and Emma unless Jerico takes him to the Dutchman. Jerico recalls that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university, but the CIA and a Russian strike team are seeking him. Jerico uses an improvised nitro-glycerine bomb to escape Elsa and returns to the Dutchman to explain the situation. Elsa finds them before they can escape, shooting Jerico in the shoulder and killing the Dutchman, but Jerico kills, bludgeoning her with a lamp. Jerico takes the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape. Jerico is shot by Heimdahl but saves Jill and Emma. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, he programs the computer and fires a missile to strike. But Jerico reveals that the Dutchman reprogrammed it to target the next source of transmission, so Heimdahl unwittingly targets himself, and is killed in the explosion. A few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach Pope and Jillian spend their honeymoon. Wells and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him, seeing them confirms that some part of Pope exists in Jerico, and Quaker watched and reflects that he will offer Jerico a job. Also starring Alice Eve as Marta Lynch, Scott Adkins as Pete Greensleeves, Colin Salmon as Warden and Steve Nicolson as SSBN Captain. Costner as the convicted sociopath turned anti-hero is suitably sweary and moody, Oldman overdoes his acting, Lee Jones talks science stuff, and Reynolds (who was also in Self/Less, another consciousness transplant movie) and Gadot do very little. To be completely honest, I fell asleep a few times throughout, it is both boring and bizarre, there is only a little part of you that forgets any logic and just goes with it, there are some amusing moments and explosive sequences, I can see why Mark Kermode says it is rubbish, or ""criminal"" as he put it, a disappointing action thriller. Adequate!"

",0.2263,0.9616,2019-08-18 00:00:00,1,"Roughly the first half happens in two mental spaces:Kevin Costner's well performed character and psychology change, which also comes with some of what made Falling Down (1993) so entertaining.And, on the other hand, a teenager's wet fever dream of what a government secret agency and officials look like, talk like, and act like; of course drenched with a thick coat of the typical dumb cliche American-gubment action music.Halfway through, I predicted the ending regarding the villain as well as the hero and nailed both. (The exact nature of the villain's situation. Whether or not it would be in what kind of vehicle and in what way.)Another reviewer complained about overuse of jiggly cam, and I concur. But it's bearable. It's far removed from the shaky-cam insanity that put all Paul Greengrass and Olivier Megaton movies on my blacklist.I would say that the film's worth watching for the streaks of good acting, fun and interesting situations, and of course Gal Gadot's scene stealing beauty (Is she single?). But once the credits rolled, I could only shake my head about how phoned-in (yet well produced) this crap of a movie is. What a waste of good material and A-list actors.Yes, you can be entertained, but you can't have this without a severe headache and the feeling that you probably just wasted your time. One star, because I would SO like to kick the people responsible in the nuts."

What follows are decently realized scenes, a lack-luster emotional affair and action sequences you've seen in countless other movies before.The sorta saving grace is the star-cast. Ryan Reynolds as a CIA-agent almost seems bland, Kevin Costner is grumpy as always, Gal Gadot is pretty and Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones. The only Gary Oldman seems to enjoy his role as the short-tempered, easily annoyed CIA-boss and makes his part look underwritten. Still, watching these old farts is always enjoying.The worst offender is the end. Hollywood-ending-101 with a big scoop of kitsch, straight out from the 80ies and 90ies.

" tense, taut, thrilling action flick that got the wrong end of the stick
",-0.34,0.9556,2019-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Well, it took Wonder Woman to get me to order this, and I got this considered-to-be a loser dirt cheap. I had downloaded a scene on good old Tubidy, it was the bound scene, and I instantly developed the theory that long-legged Wonder Woman was casted right here in the minds of the 2017 version's producers. Thus a collector's item, from my agog-by-the-actresses viewpoint. And I was relieved to seethat the Gal Gadot character survived, hell, from that snippet alone, anything might have happened. Decided to plunk down for it, and, gee, for once not much was needed, a mere pittance. Of course I didn't expect much, for the general gist of the reviews on IMDb I popped up were sneering at the movie's existence.Sure enough, at first, I really didn't go for it - just a heavy thug movie. The action sequences soon prove it to be above average. But it is the human element that really lifts it up. Initially, I loathed Jericho, but his interaction with the little girl instantly won me over a bit more than halfway through.To those criticising, I honestly can't see what you're bickering about Perhaps you only watched ten, twenty minutes here and there or so? Anyway, there is more than enough blood and gore to satisfy every jaded genre aficionado, so that can't be the problem. Plus my personal favourite, all those jumping police cars...Early on, I did notice two things:(1) Kevin Costner's eyes in the jail cell, when he is still Jericho at his animal worst. Soft, refined, like some rich old former heartthrob dude trying to make a comeback. Too soft. Do over, l'd have said.(2) Gal Gadot in the bound scene. Come on, honey, you're giggling behind the gag! Dammit, had I been the director, I would have been jumping up and down, Not that way! Not that way!But it is only in that scene that I criticise her. As a concerned,doting mother, she is spot on.Movie gets better and better as it speeds along.Try it out, you will be pleasantly surprised."

The AAA players that were present on the screen were fantastic, but the other characters just fell extremely flat. To be honest, if it wouldn't have been for the absolutely breathtaking moments between Costner and Gadot I would have scored this movie much lower. The exchange between them regarding Bill's past and their life together was inspired and for me the saving grace in this otherwise mediocre action film.I wouldn't necessarily be excited to watch this again, but based on the performance of Costner and Gadot I would recommend it."

" A Very Involving Espionage/Sci Fi Thriller
",0.1027,0.8987,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"19 April 2016. I assume it's important to emphasize the science fiction element in this spy thriller. One of the criticisms propelled against this movie is that it requires a huge suspension of belief regarding brain memory transfer. Well considering today's quantum computers, nanotechnology, and all sorts of science gizmos whizzing about, it's not hard for me to pretend that in five years the possibility of some pretty fantastic technologies coming about. The memory transfer stretch made me only appreciate how it made the story plot well realized.Spoiler Alert: Following in the footsteps of Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken's character from Escape from New York (1981), with themes from Cliff Robertson's Charly Gordon in Charly (1968), and Arnold Schwarzenegger bipolar role in Total Recall (1990), Kevin Costner has been offered this delicious role that his whole temperament and film character persona has been evolving towards over the decades. Finally taking movie elements of hard edged espionage films as The Bourne Identity (2002), Bourne Supremacy (2004), and Bourne Ultimatum (2007) as well as Enemy of the State (1998) and even Kevin Costner's own recent spy thriller 3 Days to Kill (2014) or his cold psychological thriller Mr. Brooks (2007), Criminal offers up an intense and captivating action thriller.What makes this movie special is its focus more on thoughtful intrigue rather than just big explosions and action scenes. This movie's action scenes are more focused on the raw, personal violence of one man brutalizing another, so much so, that this movie almost becomes politically incorrect and not exactly sympathy inducing. Even so, it seems that female audience members preferred this movie over the male audience movies, suggesting there is an underlying emotive component that really weeps through the digital screen. Criminal was the movie that Kevin Costner was born to play and he did it magnificently. Even though admittedly there were a few logical flaws aside from the science fiction in regards to expected espionage techniques and the tendency for the movie to be more predictable than average, these weakness pale when considering how bold and rough this movie impacted the emotions and senses."

That is what fiction is all about. What I can't accept is how they put the guy's memories into a head of a maniac and then the guy's wife is left on her own, even after enough time has passed to realize that something has gone wrong with the plan. Stupidity is not what fiction should be based upon.They have the ability to track a man running through the streets and metro of London but an alarm sounds in the house of the wife of the prime player in the story, they call the house and a man answers, and he's able to call them off? Stupid. Really stupid.A day later he's driving around in a work van he stole the night before. As I said, they can track an individual sprinting through the streets but they can't find this vehicle? He may as well be cruising around London on a parade float.And then there is comically evil bad guy, who shouts out muu-ha-ha-haa every now and again. OK, he doesn't really but that's about the only evil guy cliché they left out.Then there is The Dutchman. What a stupid name! Have you ever heard the one about a thousand monkeys with typewriters writing Shakespeare if they had enough time? It only took one monkey to come up with The Dutchman in two minutes with no typos. Bravo! Give him a couple of Red Bulls and a pizza and he could rock out the entire screenplay by quitting time.""We need to find Jerico."" Two people utter this moronic and completely obvious statement. What else could they say? ""I need to spend less on car insurance.""And then he goes back to his home, and again, it isn't guarded.And then it gets really stupid, so stupid that I lost all memory of this movie. Two days from now I'll forget it again, but I'll have this review to remind me that I hated it.I can't even believe that so many people liked this."

When they are confronted they slavishly choose to shoot at the threat (Costner) one at a time thus ensuring they're goners - on and on with the nonsense.Ga Godot looks really beautiful but the sappy ending is the crowning touch to what a piece of 'dawg exhaust' this thing is.

Yet another overly serious and boring genre film that's the reason as to why both the kingsman films are refreshing regardless of what you think of them. Taking itself far to seriously and being a fair bit convoluted it's a shame it's so bland given the all star cast it has on show. With the ambiguous ending and genuinely poor plot I don't recommend a watch
" If you're a Kevin Costner fan, don't miss this great film.
",0.8234,-0.8968,2018-09-01 00:00:00,10,"I missed watching this film in 2016, I saw it in September 2018. The majority of film critics gave this film a negative review however as of 1st September 2018 it holds a rating of 6.3 which is a score given to good films. The film reprises three A grade actors Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman who last worked together in the film JFK(1991). Here all three actors give thoroughly professional performances.Plot: When Spanish industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook-a hacker known as ""the Dutchman""-to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes, the Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to the CIA. He makes contact with London-based agent Bill Pope, but although Pope is able to get the Dutchman to a safe house and recover the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman. Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's CIA supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead man onto a living one. Keeping Pope's brain stimulated to preserve its knowledge, Franks requests that convict Jerico Stewart be the subject of the procedure, as Stewart's criminal behavior is the result of childhood brain trauma leaving him with an underdeveloped frontal lobe, hindering his emotional development and impulse control, that they can use to ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into Stewart's mind.See the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: I enjoyed the film immensely. The direction was spot on and the background sound-effects enhanced the film. Photography was exceptional as well. Ariel Vromen who directs the film has also made another good film called
The Iceman(2012), based on the true story of longtime notorious hitman Richard Kuklinski. I also recommend these movies for you to see: Memento(2000), The Final Cut (2004), Source Code(2011), Rememory(2017)."
" Not terrible but doesn't make a lot of sense

" Pretty good
",0.7269,0.9041,2018-07-28 00:00:00,8,I liked it. Costner gives one of those great perforrnances that kinda comes outta nowhere. I liked the London setting - a welcome change to the US city setting we're so used to. Quite a few reviewers complain about plot holes that are not there; they were evidently not paying much attention whilst watching it - their short attention spans are not the movie's problem.

",0.0,0.4877,2018-07-21 00:00:00,5,"Other reviewers have given plot summaries so I'll just focus on the acting and production, both of which are pretty much ... routine. It's not a bad film. For a modern action thriller it's competently made, but without anything really special going on, including the last-minut Reveal. It's quite watchable throughout though, and Kevin Costner is the standout once he's introduced. He maintains his gruff, gravel-voiced demeanor from start to finish, first as a criminally psycho violence-prone baddie unable to even tell right from wrong. But once the memories of a recently-killed espionage agent are inserted into his brain, things change bit by bit until he essentially recovers his humanity and saves the day. The rest of the cast is impressive on paper, including Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, Alice Eve among others. (Gadot is seen here just before moving on to Wonder Woman.) But the thing is, except for Costner they're all replaceable. They all do just fine, but you can visualize any of half a dozen other actors doing their roles equally well because the dialog and plot devices are all routine. Costner's part is the one that is really distinctive, so see it for that (but not worth paying for a DVD -- the Netflix option is just fine)."

But wow, was I ever wrong. What I was missing is one of the best characters ever created by an actor and that was Kevin Costner's doing. He develops a totally believable and absolutely impeccable portrait of a sick psychopath who is greatly affected by an unapproved medical procedure. What is great is that he is not politically correct, weak, or conflicted. It makes him incredibly interesting in the age of weak males pandering to everyone. He gets to glimpse a normal life through the eyes of a strong man who is also moral which is the Ryan Reynolds character. He also gets to feel the love of a daughter and beautiful wife which he had never known before. All of the actors are great but Costner raised my opinion of his acting ability by a mile. The story and production is also excellent with an ending that is quite satisfying."

There were some brilliantly done action scenes too but all in all it was too long and in the end I almost fell asleep. Especially in the middle of the film when there were those 'tender moments' with the family of the character of Ryan Reynolds. I didn't like the character of Kevin Costner either. They tried to make him more sympathetic but that failed in my opinion. It is an easily forgettable and mostly boring film.

However, I was pleasantly surprised with this film as it really is rather good, and so is Costner along with everyone else.I've seen some of the so called 'professioal' critics views of the film on here and most of the one's I've seen aren't too good.

This expendables thing with past middle aged actors trying to do action is okay in a comedy but when it is the main focus of a serious action movie it just doesn't hold up. Kevin Costner's grunting and the rest of the gang Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman just can't carry an action movie. Maybe a switch the other way would have been better from old to young.Because of the icky age difference factor there is no chemistry or emotional connection with the daughter or his wife Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot.Terrible waste, don't bother."

Bring in Dr. Tommy Lee Jones in not his most convincing role (Oldman and Lee seriously needed to swap roles as did Costner and anybody else). It seems our doctor has never heard of Frankenstein as he puts Reynolds memory into Costner sporting a new Mohawk, who is also the world's biggest sociopath. He is in a penitentiary, and not a CEO.At this point we resort to the standard spy film formula and not so much the Frankenstein formula, although I would have really enjoyed just one ""fire bad.""

From the first 10 minutes with RYAN REYNOLDS I knew that I bitten off more than I could chew with this movie. I enjoyed the finesse in which the director was able to conduct the movie. Although I was startled by the movie at first, I really got to see what the director wanted to get across to the audience. He had a vision and it was well broadcasted. From the opening scene to the closing I was at the edge of my seat and completely entranced. I couldn't not see the finale of the film because I had previously got so invested in the process.PROS: The con is simple... ACTING! I don't understand how it is so hard to convey an emotion that the script has pretty much written out for you. You can't try to pull an emotion out of thin air, that's when it becomes unrealistic and shows through the film as being wicked fake. The director had the main character as being someone that it was OK to dislike, but when you got to the end you were supposed to like him. I didn't like him at all. It's hard to like someone when they act fake. That unbalanced vibe that the acting gave to the film is just plain disrespectful.www.chorror.com"
" Wastes a great cast on a nothing story
",0.6249,0.9076,2017-09-10 00:00:00,4,"The only familiarity I had with the movie 'Criminal' was the poster. I had seen it a number of times on my watchlist and had mistaken the star of the film for being Aaron Paul. Even now, knowing that it is Kevin Costner, it looks more like Paul to me. It wasn't until about halfway through the movie that I clicked and asked myself when the hell Aaron Paul was going to show up. That story to me is more interesting than anything the film could come up with. Man oh man was this bland. The acting was bland, the action was dull and the story was as forgettable as you will ever come across.There's actually a great cast assembled for 'Criminal' however none of them are given anything interesting to say or do. Ryan Reynolds even makes a brief appearance near the beginning of the film, however in hindsight I probably would've preferred he wasn't there at all, because the cameo only left me wanting more from him. There's an 'R' rating for the film, but you'd hardly notice this because none of the violence is in any way interesting. All up 'Criminal' is a complete misfire and a waste of a talented cast."
" An action film that asks some very good questions.

Memory action films seem to have their own genre now. But this one uses real science, though somewhat of a leap, to give it credibility. It also asks the question and tries to answer, who we really are. Is it the Fromtal lobe of the brain and theta waves that determine good and evil? Are we the sum of our memories and experiences? Or is it all of the above? It does all this while still giving us a good action suspense plot. This review is probably the largest margin between the average reviewer and myself on this site. I don't get how they can trash this. I highly recommend it."

" Surprisingly entertaining if a tad on the violent side
",0.0516,0.9866,2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"A cross between a sci-fi movie and a convoluted CIA thriller, ""Criminal"" is neither fish nor fowl but a better than average cast, (Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael Pitt and an underused Ryan Reynolds), and some first-rate action sequences do go some way towards making up for the huge lapses in credibility; some way, but not enough to make this feel like something out of the Jason Bourne franchise. It's also a bit of a stretch to accept Costner, now 62, as a no-holds-barred action hero even if his over-the-top, cast-against-type performance is hugely entertaining. Also on the plus side, director Ariel Vromen makes excellent use of his London locations though to be fair, this could have been filmed anywhere. It's certainly watchable and Douglas Cook and David Weisberg's script does play on the comic potentials of the situation, though you get the impression that Oldman, Jones and especially Reynolds are only in it for the money."
" Criminally wasted

Ryan Reynolds is killed off early into the film. Oldman shouts a lot, Lee Jones just makes a wasted cameo. Costner plays his gruff, unsympathetic character which he has been playing for the last quarter of a century.The film is really a B film with some naff special effects, choppy editing and sloppy writing."
" An Intriguing Story that does not Always Deliver,
",0.0,0.9046,2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Criminal is a good movie with a well developed plot and a stellar cast. It's a really interesting story that is almost immediately grabbing as you will find yourself curious as to what will happen next. The all star cast is phenomenal, particularly Kevin Costner in one of his best roles in years. He delivers a very believable, dedicated performance that had me from start to finish. It can be quite cheesy at times, which would be the biggest reason as to why it falls flat. There is a lot of one on one dialogue, particularly between Costner and Gal Gadot, that is clear that the writers went over it once and just left it as it was, never looking back over and trying to make it more real, less cringe inducing. It is also very slow moving. Running at about twenty minutes longer than is necessary, what starts off as a very intriguing plot goes on to become tedious, as it lingers on a lot of plot points and gives more development than we as an audience really wanted. It's entertaining, but in no way groundbreaking. A great cast and thrilling moments, Criminal is riddled with flaws, but it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good crime drama, just do not go out of your way to see it. A murdered operative's memory is implanted in to a criminal in hopes that he will complete his mission. Best Performance: Gary Oldman"

" Like a portal to 90's ea action cinema
",0.3612,-0.908,2017-06-10 00:00:00,6,"Ariel Vroman's Criminal does its best to pay homage to beloved pseudo science fiction genre films of the nineties like Face/Off or Eraser, and for the most part it succeeds. All the elements are in place: padded, eclectic cast, implausibly sketchy high concept brain tampering, slick anti-terrorist war games, a brash arch-villain and adorably clunky emotional interludes. When a deep cover agent (Ryan Reynolds, weirdly uncredited) is killed in London, his FBI handler (Gary Oldman), has a tantrum at the lost secrets he knew and commissions Dr. Tommy Lee Jones to use sketchy cutting edge science and transfer Reynold's memories into another man's cerebrum. Of course they choose some violent, irreparably damaged convict, namely Jericho Stuart, played with growling, feral panache by Kevin Costner. ""You hurt me, I hurt you back worse"", is this deeply sociopathic dude's mantra, and it's expectedly hilarious that the bureau shoots themselves in the foot by picking such a wild card for the program, but there you have it. With new memories, Jericho's basic primal instinct is diluted with emotional scar tissue from Reynolds, haunted by his former wife (Gal Gadot, terrific), as well as a host of clandestine secrets from Ryan's noggin that propel him on a globetrotting (well, London trotting, really) excursion to bring down a radical cyber criminal (Jordi Molla, the Spanish Gary Oldman, coincidentally sharing the screen with his counterpart). This is the Kevin Costner show all the way, it's really the best work I've seen from him in years. He would have been way better taking the antagonist route with his career, as showcased here. Jericho is a bitter, psychotic outsider and Kevin plays it up royally, dishing out bone smashing beatdowns on random pedestrians and calling anyone he sees a 'fu#%ker'. Oldman yells at everything, and I mean everything. It's like there were cue notes next to his lines that said 'just scream your lines the whole way through', but he's fun too, that early career intensity showing through his weathered gaze. Michael Pitt also shows up with a hysterical Dutch accent, doing the boy with the dragon tattoo hacker shtick, looking pale and sullen. The cloak and dagger stuff is uproariously silly, as it should be, the emotional core appropriately sappy too. Smart move in keeping the hard R action movie alive, unlike some movies we know (I'm casting a disgusted look over at Expendable 3), and indeed Kevin gets some overly bloody kills in that fulfill the carnage quota and then some. He kicks ass, Oldman hollers, Reynolds cameos, Gadot cries, Jones looks weary, and so it goes. Not a total slam dunk, but it will make you feel nostalgic for those good old Sly/Armie/Van Damme blitzkriegs of yore."

It is an interesting idea to give a convicted felon a life so he can have a house, wife, child and so on, but please give me a break.

You then have Gary Oldman (who's role I feel is probably the most idiotic he has ever taken) and Tommy Lee Jones. And lets just say that wealth of experience is also not enough... Kevin Costner steps in too! All of that, including Ryan Reynolds, who's talents had no business being in this movie - which probably explains why he is uncredited - also joined the party, and on composition, Brian Tyler. Somebody pulled some strings, and Criminal had it all... then did nothing with it.This movie is boring. Just put simply. The story, so promising, but even worse, so squandered. Badly edited, badly directed, and all around badly executed. Tommy was incredibly underused, Gary's character was an idiot. Ryan is too big for his role. For Gadot, this was a pay check, and Kevin Costner, with a much better director, would've been right for his role.I was ready to give Criminal 4/10, but something happened in the film that warranted a bump to 5/10... What that was, I can't remember. It must be Billy's memories and personality that affected my brain through the movie. And Ryan, don't think we've forgotten that right before this film, you starred in Self/Less! However, I still have nothing but love for you.Criminal had the potential to be a wicked, gangster hit.

The summary sounded interesting, so I recorded it to watch later. I have to say, Kevin Costner did a fantastic job as Jerico, the animalistic monster who gets a memory transplant. He presented a mixed personality. I could always tell when he was just Jerico, and when he was Jerico/Bill. He never became completely Bill, unless you count the scenes where he used Bill's skills. On the other hand, Gary Oldman's character, Quaker, was always annoying to me. He reminded me of my view of adults when I was a child. He was always jumping to conclusions, and they were almost always wrong. I get that he wanted to get control of the Dutchman's wormhole as quickly as possible, but whenever he thought he was about to get it, he would order Jerico's demise. Lucky for him, Jerico was good at escaping. He finally figured out Jerico by the end of the film, and we got a happy ending. Of course, Jerico was not going to end up in a romantic relationship with Bill's wife, but looks like he will end up with Bill's job. Great ending. This whole movie was exciting, well done, and used locations in London which were quite unfamiliar. Anyway, well done to this cast and crew!"

Tommy Lee Jones wasn't in a leading role but the guy can only look to the camera and you can read the eyes... I don't want to spoil the story but if you liked Face Off, if you like a good thriller with some raw action than this is the movie to watch... Thank you Netflix and shame on you Hollywood to keep the promotion budget so low that here in Belgium we never heard about this movie."
" Who is that guy!
",0.0,-0.9791,2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"***SPOILERS***After US secret agent Bill Pope, Ryan Reynolds, was tortured to death by Spanish industrial Xavier Helmdahl's, Jordi Molla, goons in trying to find out where the mysterious ""Dutchman"" Jan Strook, Michael Pitt, is hiding out. It's decided by the late Bill Pope's boss Quaker Wells, Gary Oldman, to get Reynold's brain, that's being kept on ice,transferred into criminal Jerico Stewart's, Kevin Costner, head so he can retrieve all the memories he had dealing with Helmdahl's plan to start WWIII. That's in using the secret codes, that he cracked, to set off Armageddon. That's unless he's given $10,000,000.00 in cold cash and an all expense one month vacation in Disneyland as well as free tickets, for him and his convict friends, to the 2017 Super Bowl.Jericho already suffering from severe brain damage and not knowing right from wrong is now not only forced to save the world from nuclear destruction but as the late Bill Pope, his alter ego, getting back to his wife and daughter Jill & Emma, Gal Gadot & Lara Decaro, to tell them that he's all right even though he not the person, in being Jericho Stewart, that they always knew him as. Already severely brain damaged and mixed up in the head, in not quite knowing who he is, Jericho or Pope talking in mostly monosyllables makes it's difficult for anyone to understand or follow in what the confused Jericho's thought process really is. But even with that major handicap he still gets the job done despite being shot stabbed and battered around throughout the entire film.***SPOILERS*** Finally getting in touch with the ""Dutchman""-Before he was murdered by one of Helmdahl's goons- with the cash and free-bees that he demanded Jericho has him deprogram the missiles launches he planed to destroy the entire civilized world with. Not knowing what's in store for him a happy and giggling Helmdahl launches the first of some two dozen nuclear missals that instead of hitting its target-London England-boomerangs on him in his jet plane putting an end to his evil plans as well as himself."
" Awful.
",-0.4588,-0.8126,2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"Awful. Just awful. From start to finish. The plot is based on everyone being stupid and inept except for Kevin Costner. Kevin plays a criminal who's been locked away for most of his life, but he bests everyone in the movie: doctors, police officers, criminal masterminds, Russian KGB, U.S. federal agents. Everyone. Oh and apparently the U.S. connected their entire nuclear arsenal to an easily hack-able Wi-Fi network. Submarines too, they have Wi-Fi that you can hack even when they're under water."
" Surprisingly Good Action Movie
",0.6249,0.9386,2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,Great cast with a decent sci-fi / action plot. I thought any weak spots in the story were more than compensated by the cast and action sequences. Really strong performance by Kevin Costner. One of his best films in the action genre. I had not really seen any promotion of this film so I was pleasantly surprised.
" Costner playing a bad-ass who kicks ass unabashedly. Nice !
",0.1007,-0.984,2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"""I don't remember anything, asshole. You're confusing me with someone else.""Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner) is a danger to society. He's locked up in a maximum-security prison as a chained wild beast. An unruly person without feelings. A psychopathic person who doesn't even know the difference between right and wrong (""You can't punish someone who doesn't know he did something wrong""). And this thanks to his mother's friend, who found out that he wasn't the father, and as a response flung him out of the window of the car. The result was a frontal lobe syndrome, making him the suitable candidate to inherit the memory of CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds), who was electrocuted to death during a mission. And this because the memory of Pope is full of information necessary to locate the Dutch hacker Jan Strook (Michael Pitt), also known as the The Dutchman, before he sells his sophisticated software to a crazy anarchist or the Russians. Software that could lead to a global nuclear war and total chaos.Well, it doesn't sound very plausible. And the film is packed with completely absurd idiocies such as setting up a GPS remotely and manipulating surveillance images in such a way that the secret service is chasing the wrong person. I always skipped this film because of the presence of Kevin Costner. In hindsight, I still ask myself how in God's name they got the idea to ask him. I associate Costner with other films where he's dancing with wolves, protecting a pop singer as a bodyguard and floating on a vast ocean as a kind of Mad Max. Jerico Stewart is a character Costner never played before, I think. But I must admit that he did it amazingly well. The aggression Jericho emanates and his violent behavior was played convincingly by Costner. His performance during the appropriation of a van (the owners are beaten up thoroughly), the confrontation with the widow (Gal Gadot) or the harassing language he uses against a pharmacist are some examples. The clash between Jericho's cheeky personality and Pope's more sophisticated behavior created some humorous scenes.For a moment it reminded me of ""The Bourne identity"". Both movies are about someone going through a personality crisis, not knowing who he is, what goal he has and what it's all about. Jerico is a loose object who runs around like a bull in a china shop, making downtown London unsafe. The only thing he's concentrating on, is the lost bag full of money. The story itself isn't really ingenious and will cause some head shaking when watching it. What remains is a pure spy action movie with quite some violence in it.Besides Costner there are some other heavyweights from Hollywood summoned for this film. There's also Tommy Lee Jones who takes care of the character Dr. Frank. All in all, this part isn't really meaningful and apparently he participated reluctantly, judging by the expression on his face (or is this a standard expression?). Fact is that the number of wrinkles on his face is growing steadily. Then you have Gary Oldman as chief Quaker Wells. A similar character as Oldman played in ""Batman"", except that Quaker is more stupid and insensible. The most disappointing role was the one from Michael Pitt. He didn't sound like a Dutch hacker. This isn't a performance that'll stay in memory forever as the one he did in ""I Origins"" and ""Rob the Mob"". And finally Ryan ""Deadpool"" Reynolds who got the shortest role he ever had in his entire career.Even though the film lacks credibility, the subject is a bit over the top and they couldn't make up their mind if it was going to be a SF or a pure action film, this film still managed to surprise me pleasantly. I wasn't bored for a minute. But then again, probably I won't remember much of it anymore in a month or so. Or somebody could regenerate the memory in a similar manner. But that's highly unlikely, I guess.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" the growling Costner
",0.0,-0.9711,2017-02-11 00:00:00,4,"CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is captured and killed by a dangerous group in London leaving behind his wife Jill (Gal Gadot) and daughter. A hacker named The Dutchman (Michael Pitt) and a large amount of money goes missing. Nuclear codes have been compromised. CIA manager Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) seeks out Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) for help. Franks is experimenting with transferring memories. They find dangerous prisoner Jerico (Kevin Costner) uniquely qualified to be a subject for the highly questionable procedure to receive Bill's memories. After the procedure, Jerico violently escapes.First, it's a mistake to have Ryan Reynolds as the early lead. When he's quickly killed, there is a star-size hole in the movie. It's fine to use an unknown actor in that role. Kevin Costner steps up to fill the hole but he's doing it against type. He's also growling rather than speaking his lines. His first appearance is a little laughable especially since he's in a prison in America. The story is somewhat messy. It's trying to be Bourne-like but Jerico is no where near as appealing. There are some functional action scenes but nothing extraordinary. This is a lesser B-movie that doesn't really make it."
" Lots of action, makes little sense Poor plot and story-line
",-0.4256,0.8325,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"Great actors in this one but maybe for them, it was to fulfill contract obligations. There is plenty of violence and guns, but the actual story-line and plot is hard to follow. It makes little sense and not much fun to watch for a long time. I did make it through the whole film just to see what happens. The only thing I was really looking forward to was Alice Eve in some type of sexy dress, bikini, or even nude. No such luck there. Costner does a fine job but not at the top of his list. Jericho's(Coaster) memory is very messed up and that is basically what the film is entirely about. It is another adventure into ""fantasyland"" for thrillers, but what is new in that. The submarine shots and missile launches look nice but hen again there, nothing new.This is a 2 hour film that in my opinion, isn't worth the time. There are other films in this mode that are much better to spend time watching. I just saw it on DirecTV so at least I didn't have to open this much time and money in a theater to see this."
" **1/2
",0.0,-0.8102,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"It's just a bit too much to fathom. After a CIA person is killed in trying to thwart a diabolical plot, a total misfit, devoid of any decent behavior, anti-societal to say the least is forced by the government to undergo a brain operation where the thoughts of the dead man are transplanted into his mind in the hopes that he can complete the mission.Kevin Costner is that man who suffers more than headaches following the surgery. Besides the surgery, which leaves his head aching, throughout the course of the film Costner, who does a very good acting job here, survives a car in the river, 3 gun-shots, numerous altercations and whatever else is thrown at him.He takes a liking to the dead agent's family, but it's just too incredible to believe all this."
" Not fully developed
",0.0,-0.9852,2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Criminal is another under the radar action, sci-fi drama that flopped at the box office and has been somewhat forgettable from last year. The main concept is not enough to sink Criminal. But throw in an incompetent CIA station chief (Gary Oldman); a series of CIA operatives who do irrational activity,getting many of them killed; a truly unbelievable and often idiotic villain (Jordi Molla).The film has a decent concept but feels underdeveloped and when we reach the end, it feels as it they could have done a lot more. Some parts were entertaining and intriguing but thinking of the film as a whole, it was not too great and somewhat messy and confusing. Low expectations were what was had, and it fell through. The ending was too predictable in a whole. Pretty blatant that was how it was going to end. This is a film which could have used some unexpected twists and turns, it surely would have made the film better. But what we were left off with, was another unpredictable and under developed forgettable action crime film. As a rewatch 11 29 20' Criminal remains a lacklustre and generic forced action thriller. See Self/Less (similar film) for a more enriching story."
" Bourne... again.
",0.0,-0.9768,2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"The Dutchman, Jericho, Wormhole and the Russians. This euro-thriller is likely to bore you to death with its clichés, but hey, sprinkle with a few old-timers and we're all good? As per usual, there's no venting fake reviews by IMDb, one-time reviewer 'kevjoyce-41340' not only used the words 'perfect', 'brilliant' and 'flawless' in once sentence, but also gave the film a 10/10 rating. I'd say that's pretty much what this movie isn't. Instead it's a slightly confusing amalgamation of equal parts Bourne – the last boring one, mind you – Die Hard and Face-Off, but with a handful unfunny and overly violent scenes added. Criminal tries hard to be extremely badass, but without the smarts and flair of the many movies it stole from.Story aside, there isn't much excitement in the actor department either. Kevin Costner is not all that bad, but Gary Oldman and Tommy-Lee Jones are both seriously past their expiration dates, and with Ryan Reynolds continuing to be nothing more than a face. 'Bland' is the word here. A few cringe-worthy scenes comes to mind, like when Costner take down four guys at a fastfood joint, grabs a vehicle and starts jamming to the radio. Or 'blending in' by dressing epicly gangster whilst punching a random guy in the face – the kind of overacting reserved for melodrama queen Nicolas Cage. Or maybe Travolta in Swordfish (2001).Other than that, the movie is shot well, has its fair share of action scenes and also includes a few interesting people like Scott Adkins and Amaury Nolasco. Unfortunately, none of whom get the chance to shine this time. No doubt there are some good actors in Criminal, but it leaves you questioning if the film hadn't been better off with a tailor-made script for just one of them. I'm giving Criminal a 5 out of 10. It's watchable, but you've seen it all before."
