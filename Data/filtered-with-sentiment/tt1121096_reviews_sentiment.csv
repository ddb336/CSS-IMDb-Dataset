" Average
",0.0,-0.6439,2021-04-02 00:00:00,5,It's not a bad movie if you're into all that kind of thing but the irritating thing for me was Jeff bridges mumbling the whole way throughout! It was hard to make out a word he said!
" Not enjoyable
",-0.3412,-0.7846,2021-03-22 00:00:00,2,Quite boring. Surprisingly despite such great actors they really screwed up the movie.
" Great imagination movie. I enjoyed
",0.8126,0.9559,2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"If you like the first 15 minutes of the movie you should enjoy the rest. It's a fantasy movie.
The costumes were excellent. The scenery was perfect and relaxing during the calm moments."
" Enterteining movie
",0.0,-0.9102,2021-03-02 00:00:00,6,"An entertaining film with plenty of common places. We have an old hero who is dedicated to the hunt for evil witches and knows everything about ghostly elements and magic potions. His disciples are weak, proving that every year that things get worse. The new minion is bought from a mother who keeps secrets, and within a few minutes we already know what the thing is about: he has skills, he instantly falls in love with a witch spy to whom we wish death from the first moment (even tragically dying for love) but no.... love develops and the fool avoids heeding his teacher who happens to be the only one who is right at all times. The wicked witch has a sister who as a character does not help at all, as she is absolutely weak. And the villain has great power but a heart so delicate that she doesn't seem to realize that if she turns the page into the past she could control the world. Its finish is short and lacking in fanfare. It is still entertaining and short, which today is no small thing."
" Just turn off your brain
",0.0,0.1531,2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"It is a dumb fantasy action movie, all you have to do, turn all your brain's functions for an hour and fourty minutes. Do that and you will definitely enjoy the movie. Perfect to kill time when you have binged the entire netflix library."
" Worst movie.
",-0.6249,-0.4651,2021-02-20 00:00:00,2,"Story is not original. And I start watching because of julian and Mr jeef.
But story acting is not engaging."
" Fun fantasy story
",0.5106,0.809,2021-02-18 00:00:00,5,"An ok fantasy film with dragons, witches, knights and ogres. Nothing new about this film, and a very mediocre storyline. A pity considering the brilliant cast that weren't allowed to truly shine. If you're looking for a fun popcorn action film with very little narrative then Seventh Son is a good bet."
" Read the books
",0.0,-0.0258,2021-02-11 00:00:00,1,Terrible adaptation of my favorite book series. If done correctly I think it could possibly be as big as the Harry Potter series.
" Entertaining cannon fodder
",0.4404,0.8115,2021-01-15 00:00:00,6,"You know it's going to be bad when Jeff bridges lands a knockout blow by punching a man in the butt with a beer mug in a bar fight. Yes the movie is forgettable but very entertaining none the less if you're into the genre. Just like season of the witch with nick cage and Ron Perlman, forgettable but very entertaining for fans of the genre."
" Loved it
",0.5994,-0.0516,2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,In spite of what some of the other reviewers have said about this movie I felt 7th son With Julian Moore and Jeff Bridges to be An exciting supernatural film.
" Another missed opportunity
",0.1531,0.889,2020-12-19 00:00:00,5,"This movie had so much potential that they could have made it a great fantasy film, but as it seems the crew threw the big opportunity out of the window and rushingly made a mediocre film that could have been so much better."
" Should Have Been Better
",0.4404,0.7436,2020-12-14 00:00:00,5,"A good list of cast names, and an ok story fails to deliver the punch that it should.The delivery of some of the actors borders on pantomime with Moore being especially guilty of over-acting.The effects were good as were the sets and the mystical creatures.However its just too childish in its delivery to work for most adults.I noted another review mentioned Hansel & Gretel and Clash of the Titans saying if you liked those you will like this....nope, they are a class above this effort for sure. :)Kids around 10 - 13 will get a kick out of it, for others you could probably leave it."
" A sleeper that hit all my notes!
",0.0,0.9432,2020-11-30 00:00:00,8,"Light hearted and fun; sure I knew the storyline, just like I pretty much knew every the storyline of every Sherlock I've seen. And it didn't take nine hours and Nazguls. It follows a tried and true buddy formula, with elevations in chemistry and worthy effects."
" Could be worse
",-0.4767,0.808,2020-11-27 00:00:00,6,"It was an entertaining movie. Anticlimactic ending, but still good. The revelation of powers wasn't particularly well-executed. I'm also very confused by the presence of American accents, when the time period and type of sophisticated architecture do not align as such."
" Torts are food but also laws?
",0.0,0.7384,2020-10-28 00:00:00,2,"I own it on Blueray and according to commercials advertising for Blueray, that's like the most way a person can own a movie. Full disclosure on that, what I own is a Blueray/DVD copy cause I don't own a Blueray player, I'm still DVD-ing it. What were we talking about? Oh yeah, Pacific Rim, or no, Seventh Son? It was not very fun to watch. Like the plot was the plot of a bunch of other movies, plus the characters and their motivations was also from a bunch of other movies, like none of it was original. If I watch it again it'll be to have something on while I do something else."
" It's a shame the script is so terrible
",-0.7959,0.7783,2020-10-28 00:00:00,5,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie, the first 5-10 minutes intrigued me, but I quickly lost interest. It's a shame because the CGI isn't bad and they've clearly spent some money on the production, but the script is terrible! They've got some decent actors involved too but it's hard when you've got a bad script. Jeff Bridges is also beyond terrible, it sounds like he is doing a bad impression of Ian McKellan/Sean Connery. A little script rewording, 20 minutes more world building and it would have been better. Sad times."
" Watchable, but nothing special
",-0.438,-0.5211,2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"There is nothing very original about this movie. Set in a fantasy world where an evil witch wants to destroy all living things, a witch hunter has a few days to teach a new apprentice and save the world. They seem to be aiming somewhere between Malificent and Middle Earth and failing completely. The acting isn't bad, the CGI was okay, but there was nothing that made it stand out. Okay to pass the time, but nothing more."
" Entertaining, fun movie
",0.7351,0.9476,2020-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Bridges and Moore are good in this, always believable.Not sure why the negative reviews, it's not 10 out of 10 but it's above average entertainment.Lots of eye candy, Moore herself is 56 today and is still as hot as she was 20 years ago. Does she age?The only main complaint is the character who plays the 7th son. He is like todays modern day soy boy. He's not a bit masculine, he just comes off as this semi wimpy dude at best. That's just me though, I'm sure most enjoyed his character."
" A Great fantasy movie.
",0.6249,0.8863,2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It is very scary. This is a very scary. 5.5 is underrating this movie. I give it 10 out of 10. This is a great movie.
" This could have been...
",0.0,0.6576,2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"Epic. The actors, graphics, fight scenes were all good. But something was missing. Can't say I was super happy with the ending, either. It could have been an amazing film, just wasn't quite there."
" Jeff Bridges also!
",0.0,0.4572,2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"""With a little help, most of life's curses can be a gift!"" This show starts out with one hell of a Dragon Lady to defeat. Tom Ward is a sort of lynchpin between good and evil. A wonderful, all star cast, pulls this series together with a bond between a wizard and his new apprentice , (as all previous ones wound up dead!). The Dragon Lady witch is literally a real Dragon too. Since I've just started out, I wish not to reveal much and avoid spoilers. Enjoy, and tell me your thoughts too. Pax, and love, Murf"
" Watch it!
",0.0,0.964,2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,"All star cast, like Lord of Rings meets Harry Potter. Not sure why I missed this in 2014. But I understand why it came in at #5 in US on Netflix in the first week of release. Jeff Bridges rarely disappoints- and this movie is no exception. Great costumes, excellent script superb lighting and costumes. Great performances all around - but Julianne Moore is wicked good at being really bad!"
" Fairly good
",0.4404,-0.6124,2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,A decent fantasy witch / witch hunter story. Fairly predictable plot and decent acting. The cinematography and costuming make this movie.
" Why Jeff!? Why!?!?
",0.0,-0.6789,2020-08-16 00:00:00,1,"I kept thinking that I was watching a straight to video movie until Jeff Bridges or Julianne Moore would remind me otherwise. I understand a bad movie, they make those all the time but how in the hell did two very good A list actors get involved? And how does Bridges do such a terrible job? He's consistent so he's obviously doing what the director wanted but it's still disappointing and perplexing. He is really one of the greats, a true natural.This movie is even full of great actors that aren't A listers and it's a waste of their time.I don't think there's one moment of originality in this movie. Even the fantasy of the genre isn't understood to make good reason out of it or to do something new with it. It's done because that's the genre no questions asked."
" Great Saturday Movie
",0.6249,0.9797,2020-08-09 00:00:00,6,Really good with lots of action and great special effects. Lot of money spent on this film. Good story and great scenery. Ben Barnes and Alicia Vikander are so beautiful looking they hurt your eyes. I was really excited when Kit Harrington was in it and didn't realise it was only a small part. So was gutted when he died early on. The things for me not giving this a higher rating are the following. Jeff Bridges voice. He is one of my favourite actors but his voice just didn't seem quite right. Julianne Moore. Again another favourite actor but not right for this part. Her clothes and appearance could have been better and she wasn't scary enough. Considering this was a main role it could have been so much more than it was. I think my favourite actor in this was Olivia Williams. Well worth a watch though and probably the last half hour is the best.
" Disaster
",-0.6249,-0.9478,2020-07-26 00:00:00,2,"I am so disappointed with this film. I have read the entire series of spooks books and loved them. The film is based on the first book, the spooks apprentice. In the first book mother malkin is an old and slimy witch. Nothing like julian moore in the film. In the film tom is american and about 30. In the book tom is about 12 and is from Northern England. I don't understand the all American cast when they should all sound like they're from Northern England. In the film Tom's mother knows about the spook but is shocked by his arrival. In the book, before Tom is born his mother tells the spook she will give birth to the saviour of the county and that he will be the spooks last apprentice. In the film the spook burns witches but in the book he doesn't agree with burning them so he puts them into pits. For someone such as myself who has read all of the books to see this film is annoying and extremely disappointing."
" Oh dear, Jeff
",0.3818,0.5027,2020-07-24 00:00:00,3,"Hollywood stars such as Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore in this, oh dear Jeff, what's with the voice?! Need I say more?"
" Entertaining Mideval Fantasy
",0.4404,0.9932,2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"I came across this film not knowing anything about the books and found it entertaining with a decent story and nice visuals.
Let's face it, the story is not as deep as Harry Potter or LOTR, nor the budget as epic, but it's fast-paced story, CG-heavy fantasy action and one-liners is entertaining enough for me to not feel I wasted 2 hours.
I was impressed by the filming locations and detailed sets, which added character depth and made it more enjoyable. For example, I was really impressed to see Master Gregory's house had a smelter and weapons collection.
Fans of Skyrim will love seeing the characters trek through lush mountains and row over crystal lakes.
The acting was decent with Jeff Bridges the one who seemed to be having the most fun playing a grumpy drunk witch-hunter. He really transformed into a character reminiscent of Gandalf, which unfortunately made everyone else seem mediocre.
I also felt the story moved really fast during important story moments and became really slow during romantic scenes. Is that a teenage genre thing? The characters act like they are on a time crunch and then spend way too long gazing into each other's eyes.
Overall I give the film a B and enjoyed it the mideval fantasy sets/props, and Jeff Bridges. The story and other actors were teetering on mediocre, but the CG actions was entertaining enough to carry it through."
" Yes... you have already watched this film...
",0.0,0.9571,2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,"This is the very most generic fantasy movie you may watch! All clichés are put together, from dialogs to sountrack, including camera movements. Acting is good, locations are impressive, special effects have good quality; these together are not enough to make a good film, and outcome is just not moving. Indeed, script seems to have been made by a machine getting elements from all Hollywood fantasy flicks from previous ten years. Story looks like an uninspired roleplaying game adventure."
" But Bridges' accent!
",0.0,0.9936,2020-06-07 00:00:00,6,"I tried, but I can't get past Bridges' muddy, goofy, mush-mouthed, cartoonish accent. It was a measured creative decision, I'm sure. His acting is good enough, but the role could easily have been played by a dozen actors as well or better, and who had much better more believable accent that doesn't constantly distract me as a viewer. Otherwise, the sets and effects are fun, interesting, creative, thoughtful. The moods are well set. You can tell this was based on novels, since it's above-average world-making in depth and details.Television's modern-day ""Witcher"" series chases a similar narrative, but less richly, and with apparently much lower budgets."
" I mean... why?!? What have you done?!?
",0.0,0.9687,2020-06-02 00:00:00,2,"The book collection The Spook Apprentice by John Delaney is sooo good!
I mean... why?!?
I really don't mind a good adaptation, something very different from the original material, but all these changes add nothing to the story. It makes it shallow and poor, even when the action and the special effects are good.So many questions after watching this...
Why make Tom older? I mean you can, but why? Why is it better that way? To have a love story, the biggest cliché? Alice and Tom's relationship is so much more complex than that, they met when they were both 12 years old.
Ok, you tried to put a lot in one movie to create an impact. But this story was not meant to be told this way. Tom's journey is a long apprenticeship. Not a ""You have to be ready in a week or you die"" apprenticeship. We grow with him, a bit like Harry Potter fans, who followed the trio since they were young.
And it's not all about witches (yes, they are the most dangerous creatures in the story, I agree), but there are tons of others fantastic/mythical creatures that Tom needs to learn about.John Delaney's universe is much more elaborated and deep than what they did with this movie... The way Tom mets Alice with her pointy shoes, the first night he spends in a haunted house, alone, as his first challenge, trying to confront his fear, the manipulation of Mother Malkin from her prison down the hole before she escapes... NONE OF THAT IS IN THE MOVIE!!! #whyI give two stars though, because in the book, witches are only female, which is probably the only point that really bothers me in the Spook's stories. At least in the movie, witches can be anyone.Still, if you want a good sorcerer/witch story, go rent or buy the books. I promise, they are so easy to read (especially the first one) and definitely better than this movie. Hollywood, you just wasted an opportunity to build a great movie franchise.
Bouh!"
" Good, Mindless Fantasy-Action Fun!
",0.5562,0.9485,2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I really liked the trailer for this movie and decided to record it from television.
That was a GOOD decision! Tired from a long day at work, I decided to finally watch ""The Seventh Son"" on my digicorder. What a joy this was! All the genre cliches from the Action-Fantasy genre are present and nicely excecuted. OK, this is no ""Lord Of The Rings"" quality stuff, but if you like a bit of good action with monsters and witchcraft in it, you're at the right place! Recommended !!"

" ""Stardust"" goes witch-hunting via ""Narnia""
",0.0,0.9601,2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,"It certainly had a bumpy road to the screen, this little fantasy - and, all told, is just about worth it. An evil witch queen (Julianne Moore) has long since been imprisoned in a pit; when she escapes to wreak havoc, it falls on her erstwhile captor ""Master Gregory"" (Jeff Bridges) and his apprentice to recapture her. Easier said than done as she disposes of the trainee and holes up in her newly restored castle awaiting her pursuer - now, less than ably, assisted by the seventh son of the seventh son - ""Tom Ward"" (Ben Barnes). It's quite a good fun little magical adventure. It certainly lacks originality, but there are decent efforts from the two stars; Barnes is a little better than his usual eye-candy standard and there are plenty of recognisable faces in support - alongside Alicia Vikander - the rather feisty ""Alice"". It's still got some decent action adventure elements to it, dragons and the like and the special effects are fine - though some of the fight scenes are a bit lengthy, the dialogue is a little wordy. It has the advantage of being largely forgettable, so you will be able to watch it again without really remembering who did what to whom."

" Seventh Son (2014)
",0.0,-0.6973,2020-01-14 00:00:00,3,"Directed by Sergei Bodrov. Starring Jeff Bridges, Ben Barnes, Alicia Vikander, Julianne Moore, Antje Traue, Olivia Williams, Djimon Hounsou, Kit Harrington. (PG-13)Monster-hunting knight Bridges takes on a new apprentice (Barnes) to track down and slay big, bad witch Moore. Generic fantasy tripe with no story or characters to latch onto, a protagonist so bland it's easy to forget what he even looks like scene-to-scene (besides ""vaguely handsome""), uninspired vision and design, and yet another wretchedly chaotic jumble of bad effects and erratic editing pretending to be an exciting climactic battle. Cast has over a dozen Oscar nominations (and three wins) among them, but no one plays a character worth investing interest--Bridges dips into his eccentric codger playbook (unfortunately, the previous performance of his it most closely resembles is the one from the dreadful ""R.I.P.D.""), Moore vamps lifelessly, Vikander looks appropriately bored, and Hounsou is saddled with yet another small, thankless role in a CGI-heavy action movie. It feels like Bridges' character utters the phrase ""seventh son of a seventh son"" almost as many times as Bruce Dickinson...a drinking game, perhaps, to stave off the boredom?27/100"

",0.0,-0.8105,2020-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Thank goodness we had the captioned turned on for this piece of garbage or we wouldn't have had any idea what Jeff Bridges was saying. Between his bad, fake, ""trying to be British"" accent and the bag of marbles in his mouth, he is completely unintelligible. Every movie he's been in in the last decade or more have been the same. Did he have a stroke? Is he having one on screen? It's just bloody painful to watch. Why does he keep getting hired? Do casting directors not look at recent work? Do yourself a favor and just turn the volume down and read the captions. It won't be nearly as frustrating. I have no idea if the movie is any good because I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it."

The actors, who are known, bankable, usually pretty good, sound as if they are doing a monotone table read. I really have no idea how it went so wrong - but to say I am disappointed is an understatement."

Even without reading the book, I was extremely confused and bored through the entire movie. Nothing about the plot made sense. Characters have no development through the entire movie, and only little bits of background is given about the main characters and main villain, and the bit we are given makes little sense and adds no tension to the movie.Probably the part of the movie that lost me the most and made me want to turn the movie off is the romance between Tom and Alice. It happens so fast and it literally makes no sense that they would ever get together in the way that they did. The characters had little to no chemistry, and they ended up sleeping with each other on their second or third time seeing each other. Unless this is a social commentary on the current state of dating in the modern day, this was dumb and shouldn't have been included.Moral of the story, don't watch this movie. Go watch Stardust instead. That movies not amazing, but it's fairly decent and certainly a million times better than this fun-sucker of a movie."

This movie simply missed its time, but this is a franchise I would invest in should a sequel present itself... Although I would be more interested in a prequel."

Gregory has been going through apprentices like water and has been following in the latest Hollywood B movie craze by having our hero being someone who drinks too much. His next apprentice to help him fight evil is the seventh son of a seventh son, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) a scrawny pig farmer who likes to throw knives. He has his own secret. There is also Alice (Alicia Vikander) the niece of Mother Malkin who adds a Romeo and Juliet element to the tale.I liked the special effects and Julianne Moore as the witch, but who cast ""The Dude"" in the role of the Master?

HERES EVERYTHING WORNG WITH IT: first of toms mother isn't killed by mother malkin she's killed by and old god in the 6 book and is the queen of the lamaia witches (species in book not going into specifics scales of dirt women with black wings) and half the people mother malkin enlist in her ""ARMY"" aren't in the book, tusk the big dude who works for master Gregory doesn't, he is a villain brut that dies in the first book and works for Bonnie lizzy, oh never heard of Bonnie lizzy WELL THATS CAUSE SHES BARELY IN THE MOVIE. Bonnie lizzy is Alice's mother who helps revive her, Bonnie lizzy is more of a threat in the books and shows up more, she's in this movie getting her face fixed that's it then she dies.
THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE I LIKE, ACTUALLY I LOVE IS: Jeff bridges as master Gregory, has the same build, facial hair, age, attitude, sarcasm, and everything Jeff bridges was perfect and that's the only thing I liked about this movie it sucked wasn't like the books not 1%NOW BEFORE YOU GET ON ME I know that not all movie are like/ good as movies but at least when others have made an adaptation the try to stick to the books likeness a bit this movie took the names and same ideas and changed it to what the wanted and that's it.1/10 was horrible do not watch!!!!!!"
" Not impressed
",-0.3724,-0.7574,2018-08-15 00:00:00,3,"For someone who was read the books and was waiting for this film to be made, I was sadly disappointed. The main story line of the movie is not coherent with the first book they even add stuff from books further down in the series that shouldn't of been there. They didn't even get some of the characters correct and that was the most disappointing. If you have any curiosity to read the books I urge you to they are ten times better than the movie."
" Would have been better if they stuck to the book.
",0.2263,-0.9147,2018-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately I started reading the series of book this movie is based on around 2005-2006, and was horrified to know they were turning it into a movie because it's one of my favourite books of all time. Well they completely ruined it, the only things being true to the books is that the characters of John Gregory, Thomas Ward and Mother Malkin exist, and that the theme of the story is dealing with her once she is freed. Basically everything else is different, down to the characters motivations, backgrounds, and sometimes even very existence (Kit Harrington's character is dead before the book even starts, and he dies to a completely different type of creature). Beyond that the movie is poorly written, badly directed, and lacks the depth of character and lore you find in the book (a 200 page novel for 9-12 year olds, it's not like it's The Stand or some big epic). They could have done so much better, but chose not to for who knows what reasons. TL;DR The movie is probably not worth your time unless you want a very bad LOTR spoof. Go read the book, it'll take you like 2 hours max."
" I was tempted to give it 4
",0.0,-0.6139,2018-04-01 00:00:00,5,"... out of frustration at the missed opportunity.
The biggest complaint has to be laid at the feet of Jeff Bridges, with his ridiculous pseudo English twit accent. I don't know where that came from, but perhaps he thought anybody called Master Geoffrey must have been an English twit, but even then he only manages a caricature. And this has become an annoying habit of a once good actor with a reputable legacy, as shown in RIPD and True Grit - you can't play The Big Labowski in every role!
He isn't helped by his character's bipolar disorder either. The film opens weirdly, with apprentice Kit Harrison calling him to answer the ringing bell summons. But instead of saying ""I'll just finish my drink and then we'll be off"", he pointblank refuses, prompting a local bully to demand he do his duty. That leads to a fight, the sole purpose of which is to demonstrate our hero's ability to defend himself with no more than a tankard. The bully vanquished, he then pours his unspilled drink over him, then leaves the tavern, chastizing his apprentice for not warning him the bells were calling out.
It could have been senility, or his repeatedly confirmed alcohol dependence, or depression at being the only survivor of a noble order of 1,000 knights, but we learn, as Bridges takes us on the rollercoaster ride of his character's emotions, that he was once in love with the evil villain, but married someone else and then betrayed her again after she murdered his wife in a fit of jealousy. 
This is clearly a couple to keep one's distance from, were it not for the fact that she plans to conquer the world and rid it of humans. He has an equally fanatical devotion to ridding it of witches, so something's gotta give!
Therein lies the interesting promise of the film (beyond the talented cast). At heart it should be an Arthurian quest to rid the world of evil, but that noble quest has been subverted into a 'racial' battle. But then a love story arises to rebalance everything, since Barnes and Vikander both have witch mothers who married humans out of love (tho' he doesn't know that at the beginning, despite the clues).
Julianne Moore plays a convincing villain (which may well have won her the Kingsman 2 role she played so well). We're not quite sure whether her turning to the dark side was prompted by her betrayal by Bridges or he turned against her after she showed she was turning, but by the time we meet her she's fully committed and relishing it, to a degree that even her sister (Vikander's mother) finds disturbing.
She brings lots of allies to her cause, which provides some very effective SFX, as they can all change between human and animal. Indeed one wonders how the humans can possible survive and mystified at the end as to how they actually won. It comes as a shock to see Moore, having murdered her beloved sister - because she stopped her murdering Vikander (who opted for her new love's cause) - meekly turn away and hide in a corner, despite the blood moon being at its height and supposed to make her supreme. It surely can't be the loss of the amulet, since she was pretty awesome even before she got it back.
Maybe it was sadness that Bridges preferred to die than rule the dark side next to her. He confesses ""I love you once"", she appeals to his mercy, but none is forthcoming and so she threatens to haunt him - so the feud can go on and we can get sequels.
The lovers also decide to go their separate ways but will surely meet again, another hint at a sequel. Indeed the abundance of sequel hints also becomes annoying. Arny only needed to say ""I'll be back"", but this one has no right to feel that confident - especially if Bridges insists on hanging onto that stupid accent!"
" Great popcorn fantasy
",0.6249,0.9705,2018-03-15 00:00:00,7,Just relax and soak this one up. It's fun and not at all as bad as reviews suggest. It reminds me of a time when these movies took themselves less seriously. Good fun. Good hero. Good villain. Good enough FX. Double love stories. Fun action. Pass the popcorn.
" Bland, derivative, soulless
",0.0,0.368,2017-12-03 00:00:00,4,"SEVENTH SON is yet another cookie-cutter Hollywood fantasy adventure blockbuster aimed at the kid and teenage crowd. It feels virtually identical to THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE, a Nicolas Cage movie, albeit with a cod-medieval setting rather than the real world of the Cage movie. Jeff Bridges - who gives an embarrassingly poor copy of Ian McKellen's role as Gandalf throughout - plays a ghost-busting witch finder who takes on an apprentice (in the form of dull nice guy Ben Barnes) to battle an evil witch, played by the hideous overacting Julianne Moore. What with roles in this and R.I.P.D., you get the impression that Bridges has become one of the lazier actors in Hollywood these days.The plot is merely a series of dialogue exchanges dotted between the big CGI set-pieces showing our heroes fighting giant monsters, getting captured, and occasionally falling in love. Alicia Vikander, nowadays a big actress in her own right, shows up as the love interest but makes no impression whatsoever, while Kit Harington has a cameo so brief as to be pointless. The CGI is fairly good - you'd expect it to be given the budget - but the film has absolutely no character of its own and thus feels uniformly bland and derivative."
" Excellent Movie
",0.5719,0.9524,2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"I'm a major movie freak and this one is at the top of the list for me. The story line is great, actors/actresses are awesome and the effects were right on point for me. Julianne Moore is one of my all time favorite actresses and plays such an awesome evil witch. She is such a top notch versatile actress that is just truly awesome in any movie she takes a role in."
" ""Seventh Son"" has everything you need for a Medieval epic tale.
",0.0,0.9568,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"With wizards, warlocks, witches, walled cities, demons, dragons, knights and ogres, and of course with a side of romance, ""Seventh Son"" has everything you need for a Medieval epic tale. In this movie Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) is the 7th son of a 7th son, a fate thought to hold great destiny. Tom becomes the apprentice of John Gregory (Jeff Bridges). Gregory is a ""spook"" which in this world is ironically a good guy who protects humankind from evil supernatural spirits and beings. Gregory's arch nemesis is the powerful witch Malkin (Julianne Moore), who is growing more powerful with the presence of a blood moon. Together Gregory and Tom go and a quest to stop Malkin's havoc. This movie is a film version of the novel ""The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch,"" the first book of the ""Wardstone Chronicles"" by Joseph Delaney. When these types of novel series moved to the big screen, there are a large number of characters that are well developed in the book. It's hard to cram all this character development into two hours. ""Seventh Son"" had lots of interesting characters that were likely highly developed in the novel, but in the movie it feels like it moves too fast to get to know any of themand the movie is not that fast paced. There are just that many characters. All in all it's till a fun movie to watch, with some good action sequences."
" A Very Enjoyable Movie
",0.4927,0.9992,2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"Unlike some of the other reviewers and critics here, I LIKED THIS MOVIE!It was a good fantasy action film and had a decent story line. By the way, ALL heroic and fantasy stories have been told again and again throughout history. Read Joseph Campbell's and others' works on the mythology of mankind and human archetypes that appear again and again throughout all cultures from the Mahabharata, to the Norse legends like Beowulf, to the Lord of the Rings, to Star Wars, to Asian sword movies to many classic American Westerns. The same themes play out, so it always seems rather shallow of reviewers to pan a production for using a classic plot line. This movie had good character interplay (partly thanks to an excellent cast!), it had good action, and in general IT WAS A GOOD AND VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE. Could it have been better? Probably, but that was not the actors' faults, and I found the parts of the main characters, Gregory, Tom, Alice, Mam Ward, and Mother Malkin, all well delivered and with more depth than they were given credit for. Could there have been more character development? Certainly, if you wanted a 3 or 4 hour movie. Movies by their very nature have to pack a lot into a limited amount of time.There were a number of twists in the story I liked, and some details it took multiple viewings to notice, e.g. Alice wandering at the edge of the crowd when Gregory and Tom first arrive at the walled city, and the guy with shaved head and heavy earrings outside the tavern as Gregory enters shortly after their arrival, then he cropped up later to confirm seeing the Spook (Gregory) enter the tavern when Tom announced he was Master Gregory's apprentice as he rescued Alice from the mob. Some scenes just flit by quickly and without enough emphasis to make an impression, then they are subtly referenced later. Watching the ""making of"" features, I realized a great deal of thought went into this by the creative and production staff. I was truly sorry it was not received better or more of a financial success.Special effects and cinematography were very good, as was costuming and attention to technical details in clothing, weapons, and even buildings. My only gripe in these details might be that a number of time periods and cultural intersections seem to have been conflated to create crowds and city populations, even technologies, that I seriously doubt ever coexisted. However, as this was a fantasy, these peripheral characters added some interesting complexity to the crowd scenes.Reading some of the backstory on Wikipedia, I agree with others here that I am amazed (and delighted) this movie made it to the screen in as good a form as it did. With changes in cast, support, and having to work through the special effects house bankruptcy, I would say they did a heroic job turning out a very good movie. I was not even aware of the cinematic release, and I stumbled across a poor copy on YouTube. This prompted me to go buy the DVD, and I am glad I did. Not only was it much better quality and not cropped at the edges like the YT version, but it had some nice bonus features I also enjoyed watching, e.g. the ""making of"" in several facets was best, giving some insight into the creative process, the Legend and Lore of the Seventh Son (not great but passable), and a few entries in the Visual Effects Gallery. If there is a BluRay with even more features, I might pick it up, too. I know I would have paid twice the modest price the DVD cost, which was less than half the price of a movie theater ticket these days.Whenever I read critics picking apart this or other good or just plain enjoyable movies, I am reminded of a definition of ""critic"" I once read: ""A critic is a person who, having no talent of their own, feels eminently qualified to pass judgment on the talent of others."" Take that as you may."
" Profoundly disappointing
",-0.4939,0.752,2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"As a fan of the books, I was disappointed to see that the director had clearly never read them himself or, indeed, ever been to England, where the story was supposed to have been set. (I say this as the film bears very little resemblance to the book and the scenery is nothing like the English landscape either). This is a perfect example of what happens when the author has no clout in Hollywood and allows a director to simply do whatever they like. Obviously Sergei Budrov thought he understood the book better than the author, so happily stuck two fingers up at the fans and made it up as he went."
" Worth Watching for Syfy fans
",0.2263,0.9678,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The Good. Special effects and CGI were surprisingly good for what I was expecting. The special effects were very impressive in the way they flowed during major fight scenes, the manner they used CGI with actors in all but one scene, was near flawless. The Bad. Jeff Bridges played an odd fellow very creepy and oddly. Most of the other acting was good to very good. The story was okay, but had major issues on why the heck did they do that or this at times as it did not add to the story or made you feel, why didn't they do that sooner if they could that in the first place. In that respect, the story took several leaps to move the over all movie plot along. (Very Minor Maybe Spoiler) It also had a major pivotal plot hole without explanation on why the two major characters relationship ended if they loved each other? This was major and pivotal because it was their relationship ending that set up the the movie and why the ""Queen"" witch went all evil. The Overall. Never heard of this movie, which made the enjoyment of it greater, had I been expecting a blockbuster I would have been disappointed. However, while this is no Lord of Rings, it is very good movie to watch once and kill an hour and a half!"
" Ruined
",-0.4767,-0.6697,2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"This is a absolutely dreadful rendition of one of my favorite childhood books. First of Tom Ward is suppose to be twelve years old. The actor playing him was in his thirties. Alice is also suppose to be twelve. Billy Bradley was suppose to died to a boggot because he was careless and got his thumbs stuck under the stone he was sealing it with, not to Mother Malkin. I managed to get through about ten minutes of this garbage before I was forced to turn it off in disappointment. Hopefully someone will try again and hopefully stick to the actually plot of the book. I hope they will also cast appropriate people to match the characters ACTUAL ages."
