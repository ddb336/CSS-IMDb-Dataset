" Real good movie, with one major flaw (minor spoilers)
",0.4404,-0.9119,2020-11-20 00:00:00,7,"First let me address the majority of reviews here. It always prove true that many people who review movies probably don't get movies. Countless times I see reviews that demand the movie conform to their desires and expectations, rather than the reviewer letting the story take form and come to it's full shape, and then look for an understanding. Heaven forbid a movie should stray too far from the cookie-cutter.I saw it said elsewhere, mockingly, what a great idea it is for a rom-com about a 60 year old professor and a 20 year old co-ed. Clearly they missed the point, since the movie itself shows the complications in this, and the point is NOT the romantic entanglement between the two, but instead about chasing dreams and growing up. It's about the thin line between them.Pierce Brosnan's character is shown as being extremely successful...when he's in his world. He chooses to step out of his world, and in this new world he enters, one of a seeming fantasy, he looses his potency. It's psychological, as well as borrowing from classic fairy-tale themes. And it's not super deep, but it's not surface level either. It gives a viewer enough to think about, without being an exhausting exercise.To further underscore this, in his world, the beautiful female is doting and filled with admiration. Once he leaves his world and enters hers, she becomes a bit of a power mad shrew. But he's faced with other factors and some are sympathetic issues, others are off-putting. He's a great dad, and was even a loyal husband, and this makes him sympathetic, but he's never had to exist in a place that didn't cater to him, and some of his ways of dealing with life are childish and embarrassing.The only real problem I saw with this movie, and it was a major one, was that the person who cheated never had to apologize, or even act remorseful. I expected there to be SOME contrition at some point, but it was never addressed. This would have been bad enough had it just been left to the audience to hold the impression that they were a selfish turd, but as the movie drives towards it's conclusion, the other characters begin apologizing to the cheater for things that weren't a tenth as bad as the infidelity that had taken place. This really stood out and kept me from being totally taken in by the ending resolutions of the movie, but it didn't keep it from being worth watching; just really frustrated with how often movies gloss over major issues as if the audience is too dumb to catch on. In fact, I'd almost wonder if there were some scenes on the cutting room floor that tackled the whole angle but they felt would take too long to cover.This movie is NOT a rom-com. It is a light-hearted romantic drama that assesses life decisions and directions that probably aren't relatable to anyone still in their younger years. It's not super-deep, but it has some allegory and symbolism if you know how see it."
" The Title Has Been Changed to Hide A Meh Film
",-0.25,0.9403,2020-11-18 00:00:00,5,"This film has a great cast and production, but it just doesn't get the kick start that it should have. It's only okay and mildly humorous other than Hayek's imitations of Men in lust which was hilarious. But given the cast and story, it should have been much better."
" Great cast, excellent writing
",0.8316,-0.2003,2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Beautiful actors in a fast-paces, witty story. Deserves more than the measly 5.4! Some empty, idiotic US blockbusters get 8+, for gs sakes."
" Its not the worst movie I've ever seen, but its not great either.
",-0.5096,0.9701,2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"First I want to start by saying that in my opinion this movie being marketed as Rom-Com is kind weird. It wasn't romantic, funny, or emotional enough to fall in that category.Instead the movie plays more like a drama with some elements of comedy in it. Also while I loved the cast of this movie and I mean love they have some great actors/actresses. I can't help but feel like there was zero chemistry between them all.First the premise (While it was a little out there) I did find interesting at the same time. But as you watch on the movie tends to squander it every chance it gets. Characters just making silly decisions or do irrational/crude things. On top of it the movie drags and drags at a snails pace.The humor in the movie was okay it wasn't laugh till you cry funny but there was quite few times I had good giggle in it. But other then that nothing to ride home about. In my opinion this could been really good movie if just executed better but sadly it fell short for me."
" Cute
",0.4588,0.8382,2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"It was a cute movie - totally enjoyable. Of course, with Pierce Brosnan - you can't really go wrong. My only beef was that Malcolm McDowell is only 10 years older than Mr Brosnan ... he must have been a very very young father. He doesn't look THAT old. Big mIscasting issue."
" Another Great Salma Hayak Performance
",0.6249,0.9898,2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"I love Salma Hayak ( this is movie 19 of hers I have seen), so I am extremely biased towards anything she is in. So it goes without saying, she is the the main thing that I liked about Some Kind Of Beautiful. The main star is not Salma, but Pierce Brosnan ( Richard) who falls in love with her character Olivia at first sight ( that I can understand), but he ended up knocking up her sister Kate played by Jessica Alba, and marred her. Two things that are interesting is the more mature sister is Kate despite being younger, and Jake who is the son of Richard and Kate is not only closer to his dad, but Olivia as well. Spoilers ahead: Eventually, Kate divorces Richard because she loves someone named, Brian, and in the final scene Richard proposes to Olivia and she says yes. If you like Salma or Pierce Brosnan do not miss this movie. 10/10 stars."
" Some kind of something
",0.0,-0.1979,2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"The first half seemed to move really quickly and I lost track of time with it, but sometime towards the middle it seemed to move really slowly."
" Movie has heart
",0.0,0.9645,2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, I cannot understand the bad reviews saying the characters were annoying or bad or whatever. Each of the characters in the movie were quite human, with all dimensions represented - the good and the bad. The relationship that moved me the most was between Pierce Brosnan and his son. Being a parent, I can relate to what it is to love someone that way. The situations were funny and sometimes infuriating. Certainly America is portrayed with no punches pulled. Our massive hypocrisy was on display for everyone to see. The immigration situation is even more relevant today than in 2014. I laughed, I cried. I wrote this review. You won't regret time spent, especially if you like Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek."
" Where do i begin, oh yes, I should never have watched this
",0.4019,-0.5801,2019-05-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a shame. I don't get it. What an incredible list of characters only to watch a movie that must have lost their Director and Writers somewhere in the parking lot eating at the free breakfast roach coach. I mean, seriously this is a Hallmark style movie with absolutely nothing new to the table and every cheesy line available. Of course, let's not forget the typical Liberal agenda by once again putting weed in the movie and the plight of illegal aliens. Really?!?! And so I watched this movie only to be completely left let down. I means couldn't someone have thought of some inspiring lines, some breath taking moments, some heart felt connections...anything? Wow, this is a bad as it gets now in film making."
" Don't listen to the ctirics
",0.0,0.9693,2019-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised. I wasn't actually in the mood for a romcom and was tempted to switch off in the first few minutes. I'm glad I didn't as it got pretty good, especially after the move to LA.
Yet again the critics are way off, as they often seem to be with comedies. I guess it wasn't politically correct enough for them."
" Some really funny dialog!
",0.54,0.8803,2019-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Pierce and Salma work well together. If you like After the Sunset you will like this movie. Several over the top conversations with the father and a really interesting take on ""yankee"" women!"
" Lacks character development
",0.0,0.6652,2018-12-17 00:00:00,5,Jessica Alba's character goes from madly in love with an older man (Brosnan) to madly in love with a fellow coworker in what feels like 12 seconds. It's easy to dislike her character because of this. If there was some time spent watching the couple struggle to make it work it would have helped me appreciate the situation (and you can do this and still provide comedy).The same can be said about Hayek's marriage...it's just a blip and then she's divorced and then she's in L.A. to help her sister.The movie feels rushed to get the sisters and Brosnan all in the same town.It still has some moments but it doesn't really ever tug at your heart the way a modern rom com executed properly will do.
" Are you serious?
",-0.0772,0.6506,2018-10-28 00:00:00,3,Not even funny. A waste of talent. Get a new script writer please!
" Love... it´s complicated
",0.0,0.9779,2018-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Love is a mysterious thing and you never know where it will strike. In comes a charming womanizing professor who uses his power to stimulate the mind to capture the attention of his love interest. When he reaches out to an lustrous woman in a bar, he feels she is another notch in his lover´s belt, only to discover she is his baby mama´s sister. It is really a tale where you got to go where your heart is and not regret what you got to do to find true love. It´s complicated."
" Blooper
",0.0,0.0,2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,When richard gets in his car with sister the car seat was in the backseat when they left the house it isnt in any of the shots going to the school and then re-appears when they get to the school
" Like most rom-coms it's a mixed bag, but there's plenty here to enjoy.
",0.7227,0.9586,2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,"It was a delight to see Brosnan and Hayek together again ten years on from ""After the Sunset"" (2004) and their chemistry remains intact.The cinematography is excellent, with picture-postcard imagery of both London and LA, yet there is no saccharine to be found anywhere in the screenplay, which makes for an eye-candy feast that nourishes rather than nauseates.Essentially a very well-written, grown-up, romantic film with beautiful scenery, attractive actors, solid dialogue, and a feel-good ending that is only a teeny bit contrived, but not enough to annoy.This would have scored higher with me if not for the unfortunate casting of Malcolm McDowell, who I personally dislike intensely. His overacting and unsubtle characterisation was, as usual for him, only skin deep, and strained my suspension of disbelief to the point of discomfort.I never get a sense from McDowell that he ever takes his characters any deeper than a two-dimensional caricature, which is what Brosnan was doing in the early days of his career. But unlike the older veteran, Brosnan has noticeably evolved and developed in his craft, and as he gets older and more grizzled, he taps ever more interesting depths.Overall, though, this was a fab movie, and one that I'd happily watch again."
" I do desire we become better strangers
",0.6808,0.9682,2018-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Richard Haig (Pierce Brosnan) teaches the Romantics at Cambridge where he meets an American student Kate (Jessica Alba) and after 6 months she is pregnant. Richard does the right thing and goes with his young bride to LA, which is ""a lot like Cambridge with palm trees and chicks with tans."" Meanwhile he has met Kate's half sister (Salma Hayek) and we pretty much know the plot after their first encounter and subtitle ""Every good love story has three sides.""This is a romantic comedy that has no heart. I didn't establish feelings for the characters. Richard and Kate are initially developed to the point of us feeling ""meh"" about them. While it has a happy ending, it didn't grab me. It was not a Puffs moment. It is a film you will soon forget as Salma Hayek's butt/side breast gets posted to Mr. Skin. Ho-Hum.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. Brief rear nudity. Jessica Alba bra/panties."
" This is a film of two halves.
",0.0,0.9859,2018-02-13 00:00:00,7,"The story of this film is kind of predictable for a romantic comedy: lecherous, but gifted poetry professor is gradually reformed through his love for a quirkily unusual woman. In this case, the professor, Richard Haig (played by Pierce Brosnan), also has a cantankerous old father (Macolm McDowell) and a son Jake (Duncan Joiner). He is also, not that surprisingly, torn between two sisters - Kate (Jessica Alba), the boy's mother and her very much more Spanish sounding sister Olivia (Salma Hayek). The first 25 minutes of the film is set in the UK and we are treated to every cinematic cliché in the book. There is even a scene in which our Prof rides a motorbike passed various London landmarks rushing to get to his appointment. The characters and plot are introduced and nothing gels at all; everything is over the top as we move from one cliché to the next.Kate decides to move back to the US but there are still more clichés to present, like rabbits from a hat. The prof's fawningly attentive Cambridge students are exchanged for a new caricatured American set whose whole attention remains permanently with their laptops and mobiles. During the build-up to an agonisingly predictable scene of the Prof getting drunk at a formal reception you might feel you cannot possibly stand it any more... But have courage: the half time whistle is about to blow. And then, quite suddenly, the whole thing turns around. To be precise, for me (watching on Netflix) this was 38 minutes in to the 1 hour, 35 minute movie. There are still clichés to be sure, but suddenly the actors seem to have a feel for their characters. They seem to be having fun. The situation, although it is fairly contrived, feels more real and we start to care about what happens to our Prof and his son and whether the Prof will manage to get the right sister in the end - or not.So... At the start, only give the film half your attention: cook dinner, hoover, do the ironing, whatever. Then settle to watch it properly after half an hour and it should seem quite good."
" the unromantics
",0.0,0.2349,2017-08-18 00:00:00,3,Richard Haig (Pierce Brosnan) is a womanizing professor of the romantics following his legendary professor father Gordon (Malcolm McDowell)'s footsteps. His students adore him especially the female ones. His latest fling is his student Kate (Jessica Alba). He flirts with Olivia (Salma Hayek) who turns out to be Kate's older sister. Olivia disapproves of him. Kate reveals her pregnancy and he follows her to LA. His new family life is problematic. Kate is cheating with Brian (Ben McKenzie) and his students are bored.There is no joy and nothing romantic. It's not funny. There is nobody to like. It's simply sad and unappealing. The only hope is some chemistry between Brosnan and Hayek. It isn't there. There's nothing here.
" I like ROMCOM's, what else can I say? Solid 7 Stars from me!
",0.5255,0.9966,2017-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Hayek, Alba and Brosnan work it out. I didn't have any idea what I was expecting with this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. It had some good humor, which is the COM part and it had some intimacy, which is the ROM part. That sums it up for ROMCOM. It is an enjoyable, light-heart-ed movie. It is also a great date flick. Of course, I adore my Latinas! The little boy was excellent in his role as well. The acting was great, especially the father's eye's when he looked at his son (Brosnan) with great intent. I've never seen such a piercing set of eyes with intensity. I rated this a bit higher to see if we can get it to a Solid 6 Stars. I don't care for enjoyable movies being below 6 Stars. If you like ROMCOM's, you will enjoy it as well."
" Professor Love
",0.6369,0.9945,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Well that's what they call this movie in Germany. Not really very accurate I'd say even though it is descriptive in a way. But yes Pierce Brosnan is a Professor and yes he does love ... Love (making). He's also elegant and suave enough to convey that he'd be successful with women (some would call it smug of course).And with Jessica Alba and Salma Hayek he does have two pretty different kind of women for his own leisure. Of course it's not that easy and the two mentioned are playing sisters. Some things may be painted a bit too complicated and the film may feel like it's stopping to regroup from time to time, but overall it does work for what it tries to achieve. The actors are having fun and the movie moves along nicely ..."
