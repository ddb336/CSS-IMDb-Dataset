" Casting is way off
",0.0,0.7906,2021-04-11 00:00:00,5,So first thing is they picked an actor to play the daughter who is only 13 years younger then the lead actress that plays her mother. Way to distracting they could be sisters not mother/daughter. I'll keep watching and hope it get's better.
" Simply the worst horror I've watched all year
",-0.8316,-0.5724,2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,"After cabin in the woods i was sure there isn't anything near as bas as it, but here we go. I don't know what all in these reviews were watching all these decades but i have watched every single good movie in the genre and beyond and i can say it's Top 3 worst I've seen so far.I will keep it simple and short explaining why.The plot is unreal bad, the whole story about the visiting team, their goal and the whole ,,horror'' journey is more like a funny school short movie then like an acutal film.The acting skills are tragedy, almost as bas as the plot and the ending.The information about the ,,taking"" and the rituals and is misleading and childish.If i could give a 0/10 i would."
" Legitimately scary AND sad.
",-0.743,0.9226,2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite horror movies because it obeys my two golden rules of horror: 1. Have characters you care about, and 2. Be legitimately scary (not just startling, disturbing, and/or violent). I feel so sorry for Deborah in her Alzheimer's (and the possession)--which largely speaks to the impeccable acting of the actress. The acting of the main characters is really good, especially Deborah and the daughter. Even the neighbor is earnest and convincing in his support of Deborah. I also really like that some of the crew had realistic reactions and a limit. They also did a great job of building the creepiness without being slow and stingy about it, it was well-paced, and when they finally used a bit of CGI, they used it VERY effectively, in a way I didn't expect and legitimately made me turn the lights on the first time I saw the film. I am a horror junkie--it's my favorite genre--so I'm always looking for a film to really creep me out and/or scare me (it's extremely rare), and this film fits the bill. I also really like the ending.S/N: The horror elements aside, Deborah was pretty and classy. She makes me think of the ladies in Advanced Style."
" Fun to watch but we've seen the same film a hundred times.

" Not bad actually
",0.431,0.4497,2021-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Good film, about a sweet old lady with a past that catches up with her whilst believing she has Dementia but turns out she's possessed."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.8934,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie is eye catching, fascinating and intriguing. Kept you on your seat and sometimes kept you asking WHY don't they turn lights on like normal people lol. Overall, good movie."
" Good start, disappointing mid/end...
",-0.0772,0.7065,2021-03-07 00:00:00,5,Not bad not good. Frustrated bc this movie had potential. Loved the main character. Too much screaming and running around became hard and annoying to watch at the end..
" Looking for a good laugh?
",0.7579,0.1833,2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Basically this movie is over-acted, not scary & only good for a laugh.
Terrible, 1 star."
" Copy & Paste
",0.0,-0.9348,2021-02-14 00:00:00,4,"The film felt as if it had been copied from several found footage films, or more over several other horror films, there didn't feel to be any originality here. The predictable ness is a sad let down for the movie, you can guess where the story is going, where the jump scares are coming from, even the so called twists are clear as day well before they even happen. Put that aside the film is well made on pair with other found footage style films, this one is no different, the acting in parts is questionable but overall you can still enjoy. There is a weird kinda feeling toward the end as if it feels like the film is constantly about to end but just doesn't and keeps managing to limp on with this broken story and no real momentum. In the end I do believe only 1 person actually dies, I believe this was the police officer, as somehow this demon is just not interested in killing, I know we don't learn the final fate of the neighbour but you can assume he lived, so double disappointment with the low body count! Overall pretty average film, in conclusion there's sadly just nothing original about this film but you can still watch it if your a horror fan."
" Yeh Nah Maybe
",-0.1027,0.9287,2021-02-02 00:00:00,5,It has some good bits and some annoying bits and then there's the rest.Shaky cam is NOT my favourite and I consider it a cheap parlour trick and this movie has its fair share of it.The cast is pretty good. The story is ok except I think they give to much away in the promo material.Has some flaws for sure.Was entertaining.
" Hot gran
",0.0,0.5463,2021-01-31 00:00:00,5,"One of the best films, let alone horror films, you'll never regret seeing. Entertaining on every level & with timeless brilliant effects.... Oh sorry I was talking about The Thing.....This movie? This movie is just boring, it has one good scene though so fast forward to the caves."
" For me this movie defines ""a decent film, worth a watch""
",0.2263,-0.8967,2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"NO SPOILERS. Its not bad, you might enjoy this. If you are a veteran of the horror genre it won't be anything new at all to you. The style is ""found footage"" style. The acting is decent, sometimes pretty good. There are lots of creepy moments where people have their back turned to you, and you are tense waiting for something to happen. The climactic end scene has some creepy moments but makes liberal use of the shaking camera/people screaming/what the heck is going on kind of stuff that we have seem plenty of times. There are some dumb decisions made by characters of course, but for the most part its forgivable. Most of the time the dumb decision is simply neglecting to turn on a freaking light. If you are in the mood for a found footage style film this might be worth a try, just don't expect to be blown away."
" Urgh.. dreadful
",-0.4404,-0.9859,2021-01-29 00:00:00,3,"It always amazes me that cinema, a multi disciplinary art form with hundreds of different people involved, seems to be capable of spending so much time and effort to produce something this bad.There are several layers of irritation to this travesty. The forced found footage mock fly on the wall documentary format is level one.The constant screaming breathless high pitched conversation is another.Repetition of the same scenarios, almost unwatchable photography, the painfully poor back story, the fact that after kidnapping a sick child they just let her do it again. Oh the list is endless.There's a body in the yard, oh no there's isn't, it's in the Attic, let's burn it, oh we can't, run around a bit, start screaming again.But for me, the absolute worst thing about this film is how it exploits Alzheimer's as a kind of access point for the story.This is a very poor film on just about every level."
" Waste of time!
",-0.4753,0.7482,2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,"My girlfriend made me watch it and I did even get laid!!!

It didn't live up to the hype for me but I can see why people like it."
" A few cheesy scenes won't ruin it
",0.4717,0.6416,2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"A decent horror mockumentary with great performances, scary atmosphere, interesting plot, but unfortunately, some occasional cheesy scenes. On the other hand, almost no cliches are present and characters act rational (most of the time). Overall I enjoyed it."
" A reasonably effective and disturbing film.
",-0.0516,0.8833,2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Elderly Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) is under the care of her middle-aged daughter Sarah (Anne Ramsay) and as Deborah's Alzheimer's grows worse, the financial demands of providing adequate care have grown intimidating. When the choices seem to have boiled down to losing the house or taking money from a medical student wanting to make a film that follow's Deborah & Sarah's battle with the disease, taking the money wins out. So a small film crew arrives to document the Logans' plight.Pretty soon, Deborah's dementia takes some pretty rapid leaps forward. And soon after that, it becomes pretty clear that Deborah is not JUST suffering from Alzheimer's...it appears something more sinister has wormed its dangerous way into the family.In some respects, this feels a little exploitative. We all know Alzheimer's is a horrifying affliction with no cure. On the other hand, it makes a creepy kind of sense that a sinister presence could more easily wield influence via such a person. It gives the film an eerie credibility.This is a ""found footage"" film, and as such, doesn't bring much new to the genre. If the shaky camera thing makes you queesy, I can say that the filming in this is a bit less shaky than in some films. And the two lead performances are really well above average for such a film. Jill Larson's physical work on this film is startling at times, and while I'm sure doubles and effects were occasionally used (especially in the memorable final shots), Larson also just commits herself fully to her task. And Ramsay is really rather amazing here. As the put-upon daughter, she carries a weariness about her that is 100% convincing. Yet she has a toughness that comes through quite well, and she makes her interactions with the film crew feel real. She is the secret star of the show.The rest of the cast is pretty bland and generic. And the events of the story come to a memorable but somewhat abrupt climax. And, of course, the film depends upon people (in this case, medical professionals and parents of young children) to behave fairly stupidly in order for the climax to happen. You will certainly yell ""what the heck are you thinking!?!?"" (or words to that affect) more than once while viewing. And as with most films of this genre, there are a few minutes of ""filler"", where we watch the camera capturing uninteresting things while we wait for something scary to happen (and it doesn't). This can effectively build a mood, but it is also a very inexpensive way to make your film hit a 90 minute timeframe.In the end, this film is a worthwhile watch, in my opinion. Certainly I was engaged in it from almost the first minute, and despite the cliched film making technique, it adds up to a reasonably creepy and original experience. Not exactly Oscar-caliber, but fun for horror buffs."
" Scared the S*** out of me
",-0.4404,0.8998,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. I can't believe it took me this long to see it. The ending is unbelievable and so well done. For a horror movie, this is great. For a found footage movie, I think it is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,-0.0576,2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,I'm a big horror fan. Nothing really scares me. But this movie....wow. This film has to be my favorite horror movie of all time. It's wonderfully disturbing.
" What a neat approach for a possession movie!
",0.5093,0.939,2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"An older lady in her 60's agrees to have a girl and her film crew come to create a documentary about the progression of alzheimer's and the toll it takes on a person. The thing is, all is not what it seems.I found this to be a lot more innovative than someof
the other possession films I've seen. God knows theres a lot of them. However, I felt like The Taking of Deborah Logan was a more fresh approach and presented a very clever story."
" Great build-up, only to be let down.
",0.6249,-0.8911,2020-12-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie had promise. It starts off with an atypical found footage intro: college students doing a thesis, they want to record it, you know the rest. They choose an elderly woman with early onset alzheimers disease, and things take a turn for the worse very quickly. The first half was a very well-built setup, with good atmosphere, excellent acting and simple yet effective horror movie tropes. The second half, however, fails in its attempts at keeping the terror and tension high. Poor character judgement, loud bangs unconnected with whats going on to maximize jump scares, long bouts of nothing happening lead to more eye rolling and boredom than actual scares, and a cliffhanger that was very much not needed. Which is a shame, because this movie had a really well put together and original premise."
" SPECTACULAR MOVIE!
",0.0,0.9973,2020-11-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I felt like I was in a magical wonderland with Deborah. They gave her a lot of character development throughout the movie. Also, I LOVEEEEE that there was LGBTQ+ representation in the movie. I love that each character played a major role in the movie. The ending was amazing. I throughly enjoyed when they used special effects to make Deborah's mouth hang wide. I really was surprised when everything happened. I feel like I have such a strong emotional bond to each and every character in this movie. I love the amount of love each character has for each other. The characters seem to love each other like a family :). Deborah made me feel happy and warm inside. It is inexpressible how much I love Deborah. Deb is very attractive and amazing. I hope the students got wonderful footage for their assignment in class. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIEEEEEEEEE. THIS MOVIE HAS CHANGED ME AS A PERSON- MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, BY PHYSICALLY I MEAN, I LOOK LIKE DEBORAH LOGAN NOW. I AM NOT MAD, SHE IS HOT."
" Sorry, sorry, but not very good
",-0.5767,-0.1434,2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"I don't want to be mean, I'm sure a lot of people worked hard on this - but it really is rather dreadful....the acting is good, that's not an issue, but the story...oh blimey. If you like a lot of odd out of place exposition dumps and hideous representation of dementia then you might like this. The ending is also full trash. Oh man, I feel bad, but it's just pants."
" Long, slow descent into stupidity
",-0.4404,0.3862,2020-11-01 00:00:00,4,"Found footage and a new take on a well worn genre. The use of Alzheimer's as a backdrop provides a nice foil to the initial creepy behavior. This is the highlight. By the midpoint of the movie we have shaky cam and people looking through houses without turning the lights on just the kind of thing that defies common sense and takes you completely out of the movie. Cheaply made as all of these are, the cast overacts with a passion (except for Larson). The cheese is piled on thick at the end and by this time all the main characters have made so many dumb choices along the way that you are rooting for the demon."
" Excellent film highlighted by excellent acting.
",0.8126,0.9201,2020-10-20 00:00:00,9,"This is not your mother's documentary on Alzheimers. Excellent merge of docu-style film that artfully handles the difficult subject of Alzheimers that twists in the second half to question if something supernatural is occurring. While the cast is excellent overall, Jill Larson is superb as Deborah Logan. Without her, this film falters into trite retread, but with her lead, the cast transcends the tropes of footage films creating an amazing experience."
" Jill Larson can creep you out
",0.0,0.4845,2020-10-13 00:00:00,7,I usually don't like found footage horrors but this one is solid. Plot and acting is a little hokey but Jill Larson does a great job with her character. She's the star of the film and produces unsettling scenes throughout the movie. A lesser performance and this film would have likely been a dud.
" Blair Witch Project ala Alzheimer's
",-0.3612,-0.7517,2020-09-25 00:00:00,3,Boring and unbelievable. Wanted to turn it off multiple times because I found it to be so stupid. I live horror movies but this one is not worth your time.
" Excruciatingly painful to watch!
",-0.7959,-0.6893,2020-09-18 00:00:00,1,It was extremely painful to watch this movie even on fast-forward.... Had no story line whatsoever...! Just horrible...
" Better than most found footage films.
",0.4404,-0.1531,2020-09-15 00:00:00,7,The main issue I had is the same as another reviewer. Turn the damn lights on people. Too many scenes where there was no reason for the lights to be off and it was just used as an effect. Otherwise I enjoyed this one. The end scenes are some of the creepier ones ive come across.

" Why the ""found footage"" format?
",0.0,-0.163,2020-09-13 00:00:00,2,"What horrible execution of a horrible idea. This film shows no respect for the disease of dementia/Alzheimer's, for those that get the disease, or for their caregivers and families. Why would a PhD student set up cameras all over the house to document events like a found footage film? Why would a hospital allow the filming, not only of consultations and procedures, but in a room as well? And to top it off, why would the fire department and paramedics be called to a hospital? This film does not work on any level."

Out right GARBAGE!!!"
" Decent

" Very very creepy !
",0.0,-0.9858,2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"I know i'm in the minority here when i say i actually enjoy found-footage horror movies and I have watched almost all of them. They are not spectacular, but there are a few very very creepy films - Paranormal activity 1,2,3, REC (THE BEST of them all) and this scary horror flick.The story of the movie is kinda original, it's not your generic horror movie premise. It's about Alzheimers disease and what it does to you and your family and loved ones. That part of the movie was actually pretty good. The two main actresses playing Deborah and Sarah Logan are very good and I felt their despair and pain going through it all. The film crew was bad, I didn't like any of them at all. The main girl was just screaming all the ime and acting very unnaturaly given the situations they were into.The second part of the movie was very creepy and disturbing for me. A lot of the reviewers here don't like it, because it was ""too supernatural"" - wait, what?
So, Deborah had some very disturbing scenes, the tone was dark and the terror was real. The final scene with Deborah and the girl will stay with me forever. That was one of the most disturbing images in a horror movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a whole lot. I have e feeling I will never forget it, so well done. The ending was kinda stupid, we could have lived without that, just the generic horror movie ending.Consider this - this film was made with only 1 milion dollars, almsot with no budget and for it's money it was just great. I liked it very much and definately will recommend to any real horror movie fan and especially found-footage horror movie fans. Very very nice and creepy."
" Good for some scares
",0.128,0.8495,2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Yes, it is done as found footage, but not like Blair Witch Project. Pretty good setups for scares. Definitely a ride. If you like your films with some doubt as to their trajectory and are willing to hang on, you will be satisfied."
" 5 is a gift.
",0.4404,0.4523,2020-07-05 00:00:00,5,"Not horrible, I'm concerned that a few idiots will believe this is what happens with Alzheimer's patients, no not possible Flatearthers, continued belief the Russians fixed the 2016 election and that The Day After Tomorrow was a documentary not one of the most poorly thought out Sci-fi movies since the giant claw (hurricanes aren't happening at any great rate, snowfall has normalized and ocean levels are exactly the same not halfway up the Statue of Liberty and the fact that the term Globalwarming was used and climate change was not) the sheep will believe anything. This is how this movie progresses boring, boring, boring, jump scare, boring, boring, jump scare, guy shoots up a car- here's where it earned its 5 - characters gives an accurate summary of all the creepy stuff that has happened to this point and decides to leave, boring, boring, naked old lady I'll apologize here for not giving the exact time of this but I was briefly afflicted with hysterical blindness after a short time thinking it wasn't a naked old lady and was trying to figure out how an elephants knee (think about it) would fit into the plot. I could try and say I completely understood how we got from the reason this happened and how the movie ended but I can't and I'm not sure anyone can say how these pieces fit but even with that I think the the payoff is crazy enough that it's worth a watch. I've given no details for a good reason if I described the events that lead to the ending you would think i was describing a different movie. Not great but worth a watch especially if your having a hard time deciding what to watch? it's plays like a middle of the road horror movie and that's what it is."

" Surprisingly Strong
",0.6705,0.9711,2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"I found it on Amazon while trying to kill some time. I was very pleasantly surprised. Stellar acting by both Debra and Sarah definitely helps fill in some of the gaps left to horror movie tropes (turn on the lights!). Solid story line, although it does get a little cheesy at some points. Having lost my grandmother to Early Onset Alzheimer's, this movie has even more of a psychological and emotional impact. I appreciate the fact that they went out of the way to be respectful and realistic when it comes to the disease and it's impacts on caregivers and loved ones. All in all, I was very pleased with the majority of the movie and would definitely recommend giving it a chance."
" One of the best found footage horrors recently!
",0.2003,0.9239,2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Mia (Michelle Ang) is a film student who is working on a thesis about Alzheimer's disease. She and two cameramen embark on a documentary about Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) a woman with all the worse symptoms of the disease and they stay in the house documenting her experience. The longer they study Deborah's downward spiral, the more it becomes apparent that there's something more sinister taking hold of the poor lady. It does suffer from relying on jump scares too much at times but when it's really creepy is in the silent intense moments. The slow shot of Deborah looking back into the lens while playing piano; like the devil itself staring into your soul.... Or a certain devouring scene which made my jaw drop. Scenes like this stayed in my mind for a while and makes it worth watching for any horror fan along with the disturbing lore in the reveal, pretty good performances including Anne Ramsay as Deborah's daughter Sarah and passionate direction from Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key, Escape Room) When the characters around Deborah are pulling together to find a solution, you genuinely feel there and supportive of them as well which was a massive contribution to the interesting storyline"

I did not like the unnecessary screams at some points of the movie but I can understand it since it's a horror movie. The interpretations of the cast were above average and I believe that Jill Larson who played as Deborah Logan made a good interpretation. The direction which was made by Adam Robitel who is also one of the writers, was average and I did not like that he did not present very well the story behind some of the characters, something that created some plot holes that were not covered."

" Effective combination of documentary setting and supernatural thriller
",0.5423,0.9956,2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"I have to state my biases up front that (a) I really enjoy the ""found footage"" genre and (b) I was a long-standing fan of ""All My Children"" and have always enjoyed seeing actors from that show in other roles and other projects. That said, I found this film to be incredible. There is a seemingly normal / natural start to the film (a graduate student documenting a lady with early- to mid-stage Alzheimer's Disease), but the descent from ""natural"" to ""preternatural"" to ""supernatural"" occurs relatively quickly with building taut suspense and effective jump scares throughout. The use of the camera is highly effective in pinpointing the characters' experiences unfolding at the same time as for the viewers, including precise and accompanying dialogue that to me would be very likely in such situations (e.g., trying to challenge / justify how they could be witnessing inexplicable events, how certain things ""just aren't possible""). Jill Larson is absolutely outstanding in this unique leading role; Anne Ramsey is also outstanding, and her Sarah Logan character needs to be recorded as one of the best examples of a courageous antihero. Despite a couple of weak plot points (e.g., how we meet the sheriff, and the departure of one of the crew members), to me the film was well done, highly effective, and would likely be enjoyed by those who also like the ""found-footage"" genre."

Come on, the guy could push her away with ease.At least in the exorcist of Emily Rose one starts thinking and doing research on how it all happened to be. Was she really possessed or was she mentally ill?In the taking 2014 you start to believe that you are dealing with a mental illness until the show turn into a cliched zombified case of possession that everything turns back to normal when you set the bones of the guy who's possessed the creepy old woman on fire.I don't know.If you want to see how a proper movie that deals with mental issues is made watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

Some of the reviews that score this movie low must not have known that they were going to be watching a supernatural horror, because they immediately start complaining about how it ""turned"" supernatural. I feel like they weren't picking up on any of the clues that were offered early in the film that suggested this. The performances of the cast were great and as a medical professional, the actress that plays Deborah should be praised for her performance of a dementia patient! Also the actress that plays the daughter does a stellar job of a person with care giver role strain.
I enjoy that the story takes its time to give some character development and I don't think that it is exploitative of The Alzheimer disease process. It shows how rapid the progression can be, and then it is exacerbated by a spirit possession!
This movie could've been made without the found footage aspects, or mixed in some handheld work and I think it would be even better."

This one is about professional film makers that get a chance to see things through.It's a slow burn but the final act really pays off with some freaky stuff that is not so over the top as to ruin the tone.I might be misremembering but there was a refreshing lack of the the usual tropes that I've become sick of and we nicely build up to the to incorporeal terror all the while with our characters never quite appreciating the extent of danger they're actually in.

Alzheimer's is a horrible disease which in itself must be terrifying to both witness and suffer, and it's side effects make for a great catalyst for a movie such as this. In fact, I would go as far to say a mind altering disease having this effect on a person is far scarier than some form of paranormal entity behind the steering wheel. It earned my curiosity. I was impressed that for once a found footage hand held camera style movie wasn't solely relying on jump scares and was using other themes to create tension. And then.... Around half way through a well expected shift in tone. The paranormal elements take over. That's what we signed up right? Unfortunately this is when it all slowly sinks into the stinking pit of found footage cliches, relying On jump scares left right and centre, sequences that consist of unwatchable camera work and over the top chaos. Everything that makes the first half fantastic; the mother and daughter dinamic, the good acting, the themes involving the illness all dissapear, and what you are left with is a movie that you feel like you have seen a hundred times before. It's hard for me to say stay away from this movie because it does have many good qualities, and if you're a big fan of this genre then it is probably one of the more watchable ones, the first half I would say maybe one of the better I have seen. I was just disappointed that they couldn't pull off something a little better in the end. Watchable, in some parts enjoyable, but could've been so much more."

repetitiveness: it's like you're going through deja vu whenever night falls.so much going on: at first Deborah's problem is Alzheimer's, then you think she might be possessed by a demon, then you find out that demon might not be a demon but a ghost but then again was that man she killed a ghost or is she just mad? did she really kill that man or was it that neighbor? wtf."

While the notion of making a horror movie out of a real serious medical condition sounds a little wrong, 'The Taking of Deborah Logan' gets off to a solid start with the characters only noticing occasional odd things about her. Jill Larson is very good in the lead role too - particularly in her more lucid moments as she expresses concern about being filmed. The movie falls apart a bit in the second act though as a clear supernatural possession element is introduced, subtracting from the mystery of why she is acting so weirdly at night. The third act though is where the film really trips up and becomes very repetitive with characters constantly shrieking and so much unsteady and unfocused nighttime camera-work that it is hard to become immersed in the action. Indeed, this is one of those 'found footage' films that may have perhaps benefited from a more conventional stylistic approach. The eccentric, unexplained behaviour of the elderly is a fairly decent movie theme, but this entry does not always feel like it achieves its potential."

After the next couple of nights Deborah starts to act incredibly strange, especially at night and as her condition gets drastically worse and worse the crew starts to believe that she might have become possessed by a sinister spirit.That's a pretty great freaking concept.BUT! the film was a let down. It felt like three completely different horror movies jammed into one, each with a very distinct plot, story and horror elements. The first act I enjoyed quite a bit. It's the closest thing to the main plot. It felt like an above average psychological horror film. It's kinda creepy, the acting is pretty good and the atmosphere is captivating. It's not as subtle as it should have been, but it's the best part of the movie.MINOR SPOILERS:Then came the second act, which introduces a serial child murderer whose spirit possessed Deborah's body and made her act all sinister and psycho for some reason to complete some ritual to become immortal or whatever. This took all the mystery away from the beginning and made the movie far less interesting and kinda bad. The ending is even worse, it's a freaking schlock-fest. In the last five minutes it became flat-out ridiculous: in a scene the old lady's jaw somehow disconnects and she tries to swallow a little girl literally like a goddamn snake...Though THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM at least IT'S PRETTY ENTERTAINING and has decent acting. I'd recommend checking it out, but don't expect too much and try not to take it very seriously, you'll at least have some fun that way."

",0.8687,0.9577,2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie starts with a documentary of Mrs. Deborah Logan just to give the viewer's a thought about the deadly disease Alzheimer and how it affects a person and what can be done to slower the process. So as Mrs. Logan is being documented the crew finds out there is more to the story than just the disease.The plot was really good and it was executed really well. All the elements of scare were there perfectly in places it was needed. I did not feel any kind of loose ends in this movie as each part of this movie turned out to be very interesting. The ending left me puzzled and just wow ""I did not expect that"". The actress who played Deborah Logan did a very good job and even the rest of the actors blended really well.Yes I would recommend everyone to not miss this movie.Notable ActingJill Larson her other famous movies you can watch are Shutter island and many moreAnne Ramsay My Rating 10/10"
" Very realistic horror that avoids the usual pitfalls
",-0.6887,-0.9677,2017-05-08 00:00:00,9,"This review will be brief. Which does not mean that the movie is bad. On the contrary, the taking of Deborah Logan is one of the most scary and best horror movies I have seen in years, easily at par with Rec, which I consider another gem of the last 20 years.It's in the found-footage genre, but as opposed to many other horrors it does not use cheap thrills and the same endless clichés of horror movies, which strongly benefits the narrative and the tense nature of the movie. Instead of, for example, relying on children that are scary or demonic appearances, this movie relies on an ultra-realistic atmosphere (including normal surroundings, police, hospital, everybody being a witness of somebody scary happening instead of only the protagonist etc etc) and an intelligent scenario about a women of about 50-60 years old that is quickly loosing her mind due to Alzheimer. The acting of both female protagonists (the Alzheimer mother and her daughter) is superb and very convincing. The lack of cheap thrills actually enhances this movie but simultaneously strays away from the boring extended build-ups with nothing really happening that is so common in modern-day horror cinema (for example: House of the Devil, the Witch etc.). It is thus an action-packed but not extremely fast movie with superb acting and some horrifying scenes. Everything is balanced, even realistic you could say (up to a certain point) and for me the Taking turned out to be an unexpected pleasure. Hopefully there will be more where that came from!"
" Tries to merge Blair Witch with Paranormal Activity..
",-0.3612,0.6756,2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,"People are whining about Alzheimer patients being exploited, but the only exploitation related to Alzheimer is some old people shown in hospital in the beginning. After that bit, the movie becomes more about possession, forgetting Alzheimer altogether.So let's ignore the Alzheimer, just like movie did, and focus on supernatural stuff this movie throws at the viewer.From ""hidden"" cameras recording a creepy patient (played well by the actress) to people doing irrational things compared to what normal (real) people would do, this movie has it all. In-fact the only person that acts rationally is one of the documentary crew who decided to leave it all after witnessing supernatural stuff happening, and we never see him again. Wise guy.Rest of the movie is filled with creepy moments, which are then let down by the Jill Larson's character (mom) doing some of THE most mundane things when the camera closes up on her, or sometimes, not doing anything. Instead, the movie relies on quick cuts to scenes with loud noises, included her screaming, to jump ""scare"" the viewer.. which didn't work on me at all so THAT was fun..Same goes for hidden cameras, which are referenced twice when they CLEARLY show supernatural stuff happening, but are then ignored and never mentioned by the characters. No one even bothers showing the priest the footage when asking for help, FFS.Ignoring all that, I bumped up the rating to 7 from 4 for the last moments. They were well shot, mimicking Blair Witch properly and in a really creepy reveal at the end.Anyway, in the end, movie copies bits and pieces from Paranormal Activity (camera setups showing ""spooooky"" stuff happening) and Blair Witch (whole last sequence, surprise surprise, it still works) and only Blair Witch moments end up being creepy, which shouldn't come as a surprise to people who loved Blair Witch.This movie is worth watching. 7/10"
