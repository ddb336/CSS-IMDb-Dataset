" sloppy ending
",0.0,0.5994,2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,It started off well and I liked the references to the earlier movies. Just towards the end it doesn't work for me. Too many inconsistencies around things happening.
" Crazy Stupid
",-0.7003,-0.9886,2021-03-29 00:00:00,3,"This movie is crazy, but not the kind of crazy from a talented artist doing the unexpected. No, it's the kind of crazy of the untalented having no idea what to do with a property that's not their own, has a well-established formula that they can't escape, and is trying desperately to make up for someone else's failure in the previous entry. I kind of feel bad for Alan Taylor, the director. He was a well-established television director who decided to try and make it in the movies, so he ended up striking out into the film business by making the worst Terminator movie after having made the worst movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: The Dark World.Interestingly enough, in an effort to try and regain the footing of the franchise, Taylor and his writers, Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, made what is essentially a direct sequel to the first film of the series. You could know nothing of the story from Terminator 2 on and not get lost regarding the opening of the film. It shows, in quick order, the final days of the fight against the machines in the future from Kyle Reese's perspective. Reese is played by Jai Courtney and the filmmakers decided to fix the charisma blackhole that was Sam Worthington in Salvation by, um, hiring another weirdly uncharismatic action man. He was underwhelming as Jack McClane in A Good Day to Die Hard, and he's underwhelming here with flat line readings and an extremely limited range. He's at John Connor's side, played by Jason Clarke, very good in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and serviceable here, and they make the final push to the time displacement device where John will send Kyle back in time to 1984 to save John's mother Sarah from the Terminator just sent back.When Kyle does go back, the movie is a weird mix of recreation of the original film's opening (plus a whole lot more exposition) with a bunch of new, crazy twists. Another pair of Terminators got sent back to the 70s one saved young Sarah and has served as her guardian ever since. They know that 1984 will see another Terminator show up, so they arrive, the guardian and Sarah destroy the original Terminator, and then a T-1000 attacks Kyle Reese when he shows up. Sarah arrives to help protect him, but this T-1000 never gets any kind of explanation. I know that there were plans to turn this into the first film of a proposed sequel, so I think it's safe to assume that the T-1000 would have been explained in a later movie. However, because that movie was never made, we just have action beats without any explanation. This is a testament to treating a film as a complete story no matter what your plans are for the future beyond it. If things don't work out, you just have unexplained nonsense running around, distracting from the story at hand.Then the movie gets really dumb. Sarah and her guardian have been building a time displacement device on their own, and they plan on going to 1996 to prevent Judgment Day. Why not 1994 like in Terminator 2? Why wait for the last moment? I don't know. But Kyle, when he was coming back in time, had visions of a childhood he never had that tells him to go back to 2017 instead to defeat something called Genisys. So, he convinces these two, who've had a plan to go to 1996 for at least ten years, to, at the last second, go twenty years further ahead in time. The two humans go, leaving the guardian behind to go the long way and repair the damage to his flesh from his fight with the T-1000. Of course, the machine ends up late to the precise moment the two come out and they are immediately taken in by cops.Do you know how long all of this takes? About an hour. Half of the movie is dedicated to just getting to the second half, justifying a recreation of the first movie with little to no explanation for half of the changes, and characters explaining all of this to each other. It's boring. The antagonist from the first half gets killed and completely forgotten when they go to 2017, and the movie essentially resets with a new conflict, or, more accurately, it actually gains a central conflict, but it only has about 50 minutes of screen time to do it all and thin, uninteresting characters who need to quickly fall in love through it all to manage it.Of course there's the big twist that the studio spoiled in the trailers because they realized that the movie was terrible and they weren't going to be able to rely on word of mouth to draw people in so they decided to just spoil everything to do what they could to attract audiences. It seems to have worked, by the way, since Genisys was the second highest grossing film of the franchise. Anyway, John travels back in time to 2014, having been turned into a Terminator by Skynet, and builds Genisys as the precursor to Skynet.There are a few problems with the execution of this idea. I have nothing against the idea itself, but the filmmakers made no effort to give it any impact. The fact that John Conner has been played by about a thousand different actors in the official franchise doesn't help us automatically have any emotional connection to him as a person. In fact, in the last movie he was so thoroughly unlikeable that Christian Bale was one of the largest problems with it. Making it weirder is that the film is abandoning Terminator 2 and 3 when John Conner was an actual character and at least somewhat likeable. So, the movie only has its opening and Kyle's connection to John there as a base for the kind of switch up they're trying, but it was too brief, too shallow, and too long before for the shock to have any real impact. The fact that he doesn't appear again until so late in the picture, the reunion where we are meant to think he's a good guy is too brief and emotionally shallow, and then the reveal of his true nature happens too quickly. We barely have time to settle into the idea of John being there at all before he turns bad. It's whiplash.Then the plot finally kicks in with about forty minutes left in the film. The trio of good guys have to make it to Genisys and blow it up with John on their tails. They end up getting arrested right as things seem to be building up, get out of jail quickly because why not, and then make it to Genisys where the final action beats play out. At least in Salvation, the action scenes were interesting to watch in the midst of all the awful storytelling, but we don't even get that here. It's perfunctory at best, with flat framing and an overreliance on computer generated imagery that creates a far too clean feel to the action.This seems to have been rushed into production based on a cobbling of scripts with hopes of future films to provide clarification rather than spending time on this film itself to create a cohesive experience that could satisfy audiences. That it made the second most returns at the box office, but that still wasn't enough to justify a direct sequel is an entertaining irony. The producers had to relinquish their ownership of the property, allowing it to return to James Cameron's ownership. Nothing he produces could end up this incompetent, could it?"
" Regret spending $.5 for this in VOD
",-0.4215,0.7275,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie is nothing but boring, no sense dialogues, and some computer animated no sense scenes. I couldn't watch it entirely on Sunday afternoon with my family. Just turned it off. Don't even try to watch this."
" Confused and lazy, it has the thrill and tension of a decadent video game.
",-0.5574,0.1339,2021-03-20 00:00:00,3,"I have been watching the ""Terminator"" franchise for a few days, and I have come to the obvious conclusion that their quality has decreased dramatically, and any comparison between the oldest films and the most recent is almost coincidental. In this film, the protagonist is time: after a great offensive, John Connor gains access to the time machine built by Skynet and sends Kyle Reese into the past, on a mission to protect his mother, Sarah. We already know this, this was the beginning of the initial film in the franchise. However, when Reese arrives, she discovers that the past has been changed: Sarah Connor already knows everything that awaits her, Reese's arrival was expected and there is a T-800 model protecting her. So, they decide to try to destroy Skynet before it is globally released.What this movie did was a mess. The temporal paradox created is so strange, confusing and raises so many questions that it is bad to think about it. Other films and franchises also played with the timelines, as did the X-Men with ""Days of Future Past"", but the care in writing allowed results that, here, cannot be achieved. After some reading, I realized that the production was troubled, and it was not a peaceful and easy effort for any of those involved, so I believe that no one misses the film, starting with the cast, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief when Paramount canceled the next two films.The script is confusing and poorly written, the characters are almost all merely outlined and underdeveloped. Even so, the film has the merit of trying to escape a little from the usual formula of the ""Terminator"" films: mass destruction, persecution and a lot of twisted metal. There are, as in the past, efforts for some humorous moments, but they are misplaced and have never been effective. The direction, ensured by Alan Taylor, is an unfortunate effort, as the director had everything in his hands to do a decent job and never got it. It even seems that he felt lost and not knowing what to do, deciding to make a noisy film, with tons of noisy and flamboyant action instead of a darker, tense film, where the threat was truly palpable for the audience. Basically, he gave us a video game.The cast is quite weak and seems to be acting on its own, without coordination or direction. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to play the character that made him famous once again, and I have to applaud his effort to look credible, even after so many years. He is clearly a committed actor, who takes his work seriously, and I admire his dedication. I also appreciated Emilia Clarke's effort. Despite being an effort undermined by the terrible material she received and the virtual absence of direction, she worked as hard as she could and made Sarah Connor a more feminine, elegant character. Jai Courtney is annoying and acted randomly. He seems lost, not knowing how to play Reese properly. Jason Clarke is obnoxious in every way.It is on production values and technical aspects that a good part of this film is based, which sounds like an excuse for a noisy action blockbuster. As I said above, the feeling of danger and tension never happens, and everything sounds as artificial as it is. The sound effects are very good and the CGI is good, but it is not exactly impressive. Cinematography is good, and makes good use of landscapes and green screen backdrops, but at times it looks gloomy and with somewhat washed colors. The makeup work and costumes are good, but they are within what was required and do not bring anything surprising. The post-production work was done with some laziness and sloppiness, and the cuts are sometimes sudden and evident. The soundtrack is forgettable and uninteresting, when it is actually used."
" Losing It's Grit
",-0.3818,0.7311,2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"This is the point in the Terminator franchise where it loses its grit. The idea of changing the past once again is good, and going down memory lane with alternate revised scenes from the originals works well. But the film seems too clean and lacking any sort of scare factor, leaning towards more comedy. It doesn't feel organic, it's like - here is the time for VFX, now it's time to talk, now we shoot some guns. Most of the VFX are well done as usual."

I don't have much to knock about this movie other than that I got a bit confused with the plot at first but eventually got it."
" The film was new ones Dan made the ultimate timeline work
",0.0,0.9593,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"The film was nuanced and made the ultimate timeline work: First of all they're saying it was a box office failure when it grows three times the budget!
Don't quite understand that!
I like Sarah Connor's and Reese of the actors and of course an even more nuanced Arnold Schwarzenegger as he evolve into being more human!
They definitely could've gone on for another sequel I had all the makings of the further adventures of Sarah Connor Kyle Reese and that new storyline for John Connor!
We'll see where this franchise goes: I actually like Genesis more than I like dark fate!
I like all the Terminator movies each added something to the overall story of man's fate versus machine and artificial intelligence: like the matrix which is re-booting its sequels!

" AWESOME, MINDLESS FUN
",0.6705,-0.8401,2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Ignore the bad reviews, watch this with an open mind and just enjoy the mindless action. It's not perfect but there are much worse films out there you could watch.Great in 3D too."
" Don't understand the bad reviews

I don't really understand the bad reviews of this film. Ok, it's not spielberg, not that kind of film what we expect. But this film is far more better then T3 or Salvation. This film has some good idea, some good dialog, some interesting concepts. Very creative as for that.
The acting is a little bit dull, however they think of a new type of enemy, and brought back the old T-1000, but in an interesting way. Ok, not a T1 nor T2 (because that two is impossible to beat) but this film is entertaining, and can be interesting. Give it a chance"
" Review for Termination 2015
",0.0,0.901,2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,It is my first terminator film to watch from Netflix so I might buy the collection I wouldn't say it's one of my favourite films but I did like it so it's 5.7 which I rounded to 6 but good film especially for people interested in time travel movie's.

" Terminator Genisys: the sequel that we never wanted
",0.0,0.8523,2021-01-22 00:00:00,6,"The only reason I am giving this movie a rating higher than 5 is because i love the Terminator franchise, I love Arnold Schwarzenegger and (although in this film she is nothing special) I love Emilia Clarke.The first two, and especially the 2nd movie were amazing. T2: Judgement Day was and always will be one of my alltime favourite movies in every genre i have ever seen. But cmon, man this is the 5th movie in the franchise, along with the TV series (which everyone liked, but I think its nothing soo spectacular and special, except maybe Summer Glau). Just how many more movies will these guys make. It's getting ridiculous.
The CGI in Genisys was abysmal, it was like a video game, and The Last of us 2 looked more real than this thing. The only CGI that looked good was the young Arnie. The endoskeletons in T2 looked wayy more realistic and T2 is almost 30 years old. Genisys tries to do stupid comedy bits (like the one in the prison) that are just so out of place and so stupid that I hadto cover my eyes. The guy that played Kyle Reese was awful and too macho for that character. The helicopter scene was one of the worst things I have ever seen, flying like a freaking spaceship or something. They completely destroyed the John Connor storyline and with it - the first 2 parts. The John Connor character became meaningless and that may be the worst sin that Genisys made.There were thing I liked though. I loved that Arnie was back, the scene old Arnie vs young Arnie was good. And we heard the full Terminator theme for the first time since T2 in the ending credits, which always gives me goosebumps. But just, please for the love of God stop doing sequels to Terminator, nothing good will ever come out of this. I still haven't seen Dark Fate, but I'm getting a feeling it will be even worse. I can't give a rating of 1 or 2 for a movie starring Arnold, but just stop it, you are loosing it Hollywood..."

" TERMINATORS. Fighting Fate
",-0.3612,0.6397,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"""Genisys"" is not a sequel to ""Salvation"". It is not even a sequel to the original two films. It does not develop that old story. It reaches for the very core of that story and points it in a different direction. Here, the time machine is not just a means to go back in time and alter an event. Here, it is a tactical weapon that can be used multiple times. Time itself has become a battle field.John Connor, Kyle Reese, Sarah Connor and Guardian are all interesting characters. Despite dealing with technology and cold strategy, the plot is very human at heart. The cast was great, especially Jason Clarke. What surprised me, though, is how good Jai Courtney turned out to be in a heroic role. As a villain, say, in ""Jack Reacher"", Courtney was brilliant. As a hero, though, he was not impressive in the fifth ""Die Hard"", and I seriously doubted if casting him here was a good idea. I was wrong. And Arnold, in spite of his age, was wonderful in every way. Also, unlike some other new installments in old film franchises, ""Terminator: Genisys"" does not bring back the old actor only to ruin the familiar character. Arnold has a big part, and a meaningful one.Not all is well, though. What immediately sets this movie apart from all the four before it, is how much CGI it has. And not all of it was good. There is not one evil terminator, there are several. But it does not matter because two of them get destroyed with relative ease. And the third one has a ridiculous weak spot. Magnets. What makes the robot interesting is not what it technically is, but what the actor does with the part. Regardless, terminators are no longer scary.Then there is the plot. Multiple timelines, points connecting them, people and machines going from timeline to timeline. Like I said before, the film has a heart. But as for the logic, well, the less you think about the plot, the better. Not that it does not make any sense, but it could have been a direct sequel to the franchise instead of what it is.In conclusion, the plot is dramatic but problematic, like ""Salvation"". Unlike ""Salvation"", though, it has a sense of humor and does not want to be extremely serious. Visually, ""Genisys"" is easily the worst terminator film yet. Too much CGI."

There are lots of reasons, and some of them almost make sense when you think about it. Now, that we're beginning, forget that, we'll start doing something else entirely.
Now I'm going to explain why I'm going to write a new review about a blockbuster involving time travel. There are several contributing factors, and if you consider them long enough, you will begin to comprehend. Now that we have begun, let's switch things up, we'll enact a new plan.
At this point, it's time for me to pen a review for a sequel to the 80s Schwarzenegger flick that is unique from the one I originally planned. There are details pertinent to understanding. You will mull things over until you connect the dots. We are in the execution phase, and now we are doing something else. Congratulations! You should understand the general feel of the film."

Action was ok, Arnie was good as always, emila Clark as Sarah was just bad, the anything that surprised me was Jason Clark as John Conner really good actor but the role he was put into as being a terminator himself was just too much I rather saw him as the hero. And wtf happend to the guy playing the t1000 they just brought that into the movie as a nostalgic feeling but he could definitely be the end bad guy. Why why why just take it over the top and change every good actor in this movie to an unbelievable ending. I wanted this to be good but they just took too much extra to make it a good movie way over the top. Just 5 stars for Arnie showing up and good actors that deserved a better writing."
" So So
",0.0,-0.296,2020-11-21 00:00:00,5,This entry of the franchise is more repetitive approach going back in time and stopping Skynet and the original Terminator from killing Sarah Connor.This time the events of the first film and second film are medhed together but with a new element to deal with.I felt very confused why any of this served it's purpose when it was explained and to degree stopped from the early films. I appreciate Arnold reprising his role but gives basic straight forwardness to his role in the story although I did enjoy the brief present Terminator vs past Terminator. I felt this didn't do much justice but just gave everyone reversed roles with a comic book ending.
" Great special effects.....

It started well, even though the Reese actor is nothing like the enigmatic Bale. The freakily sized biceps had us wondering how on earth he'd managed to get a shirt or jacket to fit them. His acting was abysmal. I hated the product placement of the nike training shoes (apparently viewers would have pointed out if the shoes were wrong ..... really? I think not, I mean who cares?).Despite Sarah Connor having several years to train for this day - she was a little dumpy and unfit, again no Linda Hamilton.We are now told the terminator machine came to Sarah when she was seven, yet she wasn't aware of them in the original film until told about them - I gave up trying to fathom things out as apparently the reason for changes in original storyline are put down to a blip in the time machine making changes. Lazy way to change the course of history in the film. Oh well. Just sit back enjoy the constant hitting, fighting, the getting up again and continuing the fight, blasts, very thin walls being pushed through and vending machine toppled over.I gave up before the end. Great to see Matt Smith even if was only for a second in the beginning and as a hologram thing towards the end. Now HE would have made a great Rease."

A lot of questions leaved without an answer (and trust me, there are a lot, really).
An ending without an explanation. I mean, the question that passed through my mind at the end of the final battle was: how was that possible?If you had watch it, did you find out who is the god? And where is the magic? It's not so complicated, right?Do you want a good advice? Don't bother yourself and don't waste two hours of your time with this movie.

Arnie was great as per but Emilia didnt fit the Sarah character and less said about Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke as Kyle Reese and John Connor the better.

The plot is generally so stupid that you wonder if this movie had a script.

" Ohhhh... So Many Timelines!!!
",0.0,0.9674,2020-11-13 00:00:00,5,"Alan Taylor's 'Terminator Genisys' (2015) is the 5th film (Yeah I know, it's crazy, right?) in the 'Terminator' franchise and it is about Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) going back in time to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke).I find it absolutely hilarious, but also a bit frustrating that the studio seems to really want to suck all the air out of the 'Terminator' franchise until it isn't profitable anymore. This franchise could have been done after its first film, but Cameron decided to direct a second film and obviously pulled off a fantastic sci-fi action film beloved by the film fan community! Then, 12 years later, the third 'Terminator' film came along and, in a way, set up the fourth film in 'Terminator Salvation'! The ending of 'Salvation' could have easily been the finale of the franchise, yet they still weren't done with it and decided to make 'Terminator Genisys'.Let me now talk about the fifth film, 'Terminator Genisys'.
First of all, I would like to commend the film for its first 40 minutes which showed a lot of great potential as well as a ton of nostalgia coming through for the fans of the franchise! I actually really liked that section of the film because it felt somewhat like 'Back to the Future Part II' by going back to a time we are already familiar with from the first two 'Terminator' films!However when that first third of the film is over, the movie turns into this confusing science fiction film that demonstrates so much familiarity from the franchise's first two iterations.
Another problem with the film is that it struggles when it comes to the pacing as it moves closer to the end.
I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again because it is so important: this film is CONFUSING! It really gets hard following the logistics of time travel or at least this film's understanding of said phenomenon!Overall, 'Terminator Genisys' is a film that seemed promising, but wasted so much of its potential due to bland, generic storytelling! Failing to bring back the glory of the franchise, this iteration remains predictable at the end of the day! 5/10"
" Way better than Dark Fate

I liked the ""Pops"" comeback of the old T800 much more than that ""Carl"" thing they did in the other movie, he was much more relatable.

And that's just naming 2! Another problem I have with this film is that it basically gives the middle finger to any fans of terminator 1, 2 or even 3 or 4 by basically saying. ""Remember those films you loved well they don't matter anymore since they never bloody happened thanks for waiting your time and money into this franchise just for us to basically reset everything in film 5!"" This is the reason why I hate this film so much over all I would not recommend any terminator film between 3 and 5. My recommendation for watching the terminator movies is watch 1 2 and maybe 3 and then just watch a recap of 4 and 5 and then skip to number 6. Worst sequel I've ever seen 2/10"

Matt Smith does a great job as a side villain.This movie is essentially a reboot. It does have some nice fan service to the original though. This new revamped Sarah Connor is much more kick-ass and a strong independent woman type. Kyle is more of a side character in this one but I'm ok with that.There are obviously a few inconsistencies in this movie and a lot is unexplained and left open to interpretation.

" Serviceable action flick suffering from the shadow of its franchise
",-0.4767,0.9602,2020-08-14 00:00:00,6,"If it wasn't part of such a genre redefining franchise as Terminator, Genisys would be a perfectly serviceable action sci-fi. Sure the dialogue is clunky as hell, the convoluted time travel conceits don't ever really make sense and despite one decent twist it's a tad predictable. But hey this is blockbuster cinema and the action is great, the film rattles along at pace and the acting is genuinely not bad (Courtenay spending a large part of the film topless didn't hurt either!). But you can't escape the legacy. This IS supposed to be part of the Terminator mythology. Despite Arnie's best comedic efforts (he steals most scenes he's in) you can't get past what an inferior addition this is to join at least two of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 20th century. Whilst enjoyable enough in its own right, hopefully this will be the last attempt to resurrect the past Terminator glories."
" What a mess

The first part is the future war and it expands on the franchise but it was too bright and full of shiny CGI. The second part plays out like the first film but with a twist - the timeline has changed and Sarah Connor is already familiar with terminators. The flaws are already apparent here - the gritty feel is gone, Kyle Reese's actor is the human equivalent of white bread, there are too many terminators running around, we don't feel the sense of threat, and more. The third part is a complete mess where John Connor has become a bad terminator, they blow up Cyberdyne as usual and Skynet is a vaguely contrived app called Genisys for... reasons. Ultimately, this film just should not have existed. The other Terminator sequels had their flaws but at least they had focus."

Sadly, though that doesn't last for very long and we are soon back in the repetitious, though admittedly fast paced, ""John Connor"" versus ""Skynet"" scenario. This time Jason Clarke takes up the ""Connor"" mantle determined to stop Skyney from undoing all the good work he, mother ""Sarah"" (in this iteration, Emilia Clarke) and Arnie have done thus far. When this cunning plan comes to nought, he sends his lieutenant ""Reese"" (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect ""Sarah"" and together , along with her ""Guardian"" (Arnie) they must evade a whole new breed of ""Terminator"" sent to eliminate her before she can conceive and give birth to their nemesis. This really does lack any sense of peril or menace, the story moves along well enough but none of the performances really catch fire. The effects are good enough, but the dialogue is pretty poor and the romance that develops between Clarke & Courtney just gets in the way. Made for the sake of it, this one, and that's a shame..."

",0.2263,0.9682,2020-07-15 00:00:00,7,"It all depends on which angle you decide to look this movie at. Let me explain: the Terminator franchise has a troubled story regarding timelines. Much like the X-Men one, it played with the order of events so much it became almost impossible for fans to understand it through. So if you're an old school Terminator fan you're probably gonna hate this since it pretty much revisits the first two movies and also changes the course of events ignoring Terminator 2 plot.
Instead if you're approaching the franchise without being so puristic or even having never watched the other movies I guarantee you're gonna like this. It's a nice film after all. It has good directing, great cgi and visual effects and above all a great cast led by main actors Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke and of course the unmissable Arnold Schwarzenegger as the most fun Terminator Hollywood ever gifted us."
" John Connor talks too much,,, lol
",0.4215,0.9865,2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"First,, I will say that the last thing I would call this movie is bad. Matter of fact,, it's pretty dang good imo. I mean,, Alan Taylor is good (I enjoyed GoT, and Thor 2). That being said,,,The movie starts off in the future, and we hear Kyle Reese talking about the war with Skynet and how John Connor is leading the humans to defeat the machines. Making a long story shorter,, they win the war, but Skynet has already sent the Terminator back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor,, so John asks for a volunteer to go and protect her. Kyle, of course, volunteers immediately, and as he is being sent back he sees a Terminator latch on to John. Kyle reaches out, but it's already too late. He lands (literally) in 1984.
The next few mins happens pretty much the same as the first movie,, except Reese gets caught by two cops while evading a different Terminator (not Arnold version). One cop is killed by said Terminator, and has the other Cop and Reese trapped in a retail store. Otb,, an armored car crashes into the store and knocks the Terminator out of commission, momentarily. The door flies open,, and to Reese's surprise the driver turns out to be Sarah Connor,,, who says the famous line, ""Come with me if you wanna live."" If you want to know more,, well see the film,,,Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen it.Now,, there was so much about this movie that I thought was great. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor? Are u kidding me? She was perfect!! I thought Jai Courtney was a great choice to play Kyle Reese. Jason Clarke was also a good choice to play John. Arnold,,, well,, he IS the Terminator!! Lol,,, I also really liked J.K. Simmons character and contribution to the film. I thought the cast really worked well together.Now,, the idea of Kyle and Sarah going to the future and then John showing up as a hybrid Terminator? It's not that the idea can't work,, I just don't think that it works as anything OTHER than an alternate version in a different universe. I don't think this film works with continuing the story after Terminators 1, 2, and 3 (of course 3 has been changed now bc of Dark Fate,, but still). Imo,, the story works as the following - Terminator 1, then 2, then 3, then Terminator Salvation,,, or Terminator 1, then 2, then Dark Fate. Imo,, Terminator Genisys is a different universe. Does that make it bad,,, not in the least. I say it's a 6.8!So go watch it!!!"

On the one hand, the basic backbone of the plot is actually quite interesting, with its alternative timelines and multiple terminators and such, but sadly it was not directed or produced in a way that really does its ideas justice. The two leads were not particularly convincing I didn't think, and were light years behind Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn back in the original film. The film started confusing itself and the flow felt disjointed, with a lot of plot holes and loose ends that never went anywhere.

" Obsolete - please terminate
",0.0258,0.9954,2020-06-15 00:00:00,5,"Bear with me and I'll try and get this right.... John Connor sends Kyle Reese back to the past to protect the future, but when he gets there it's not the past he was expecting to go back to, but a different past that isn't the past that he went through. He meets Sarah Connor who already knows who he is and is accompanied by a T-800 Terminator. Don't be alarmed though, this is a good Terminator that was sent to protect her when she was 9 years old, from a bad Terminator, which Kyle would have know if it was the past that he should have lived, but didn't. Kyle doesn't know any of this because it's a different timeline than the one he's come back in time from. Because of the timeline criss-crossing Kyle is experiencing visions and feelings of a time that he hasn't lived, but should have if time had been different, which it wasn't for him. Sarah already has a plan to save the future by travelling to the future to save the distant future, but Kyle argues that rather than that future, they travel to a different distant future to save the far distant future - is this all clear? Oh yes, and John Connor comes back from the future to the past, which is a future that is new to Kyle, to kill them all, because he's not really John Connor, but is.While the previous film, ""Terminator: Salvation"", looked to be exploring a new and exciting route for the franchise, this film falls back into old habits. Like a comfortable pair of slippers, this film dons on a lot of the cliches, one liners and time travelling antics that you would expect to find from other films in the franchise. The only problem is that the other films (barring ""Terminator 3"") already did them, did them really well, and were original in doing them really well. To see these kind of things here it's like a parody of itself, or like the director wanted to add Terminator Easter eggs, without actually adding them properly. In fact it's more a kin to a rehash than a parody. To give an example, how many times in a franchise can you hear ""Come with me if you want to live"", or ""I'll be back""? Just lazy. How many times can you see Arnie's Terminator character get beaten to death only to mysterious come from nowhere to save the day again.I didn't particularly fall in love with the casting in this film I'm afraid. I've seen all the central characters in other films giving better, more believable performances. In my opinion, this ensemble was probably the worst group I've seen acting those characters. If I put my mind to it and think of all the Terminator on-screen performances, I can easily give a better adaption of the character than appeared in this film. They weren't awful by any stretch, but they weren't engaging and authentic either.The action was decent, but wasn't anything breathtaking or new. I'm afraid it's pretty much all been done before and this film just rehashed rather than innovated. I was not surprised by anything, and nothing amazed me (God, I'm beginning to sound like an emotionless robot now!?!)The plot was all over the place and actually hurts to understand if you actually sit down and try to map it out. It was a case of style over substance, which makes the director and writers come across as lazy, almost like they are just milking the franchise by not doing anything new or exciting with it. Pity.I really wanted to like this film, but after watching it numerous times now though, it actually starts to make ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" more credible - and that really is saying something. It hurts me to award a low rating because of how amazing the first two films in the franchise were, but the best I can do is give this a 5 out of 10. To put that into context, the first Terminator gets 10/10 from me - this 5th film in series is half the film the first one was - sad times :("

" Full of flaws and without originality, the excess of new information that confuses the story to the point that the characters have to explain all the time about time travel
",-0.3182,0.9762,2020-05-23 00:00:00,6,"After the franchise's last film shows life in the future in the midst of human war with machines, Genesis' turn comes to try to breathe a new breath into the series of films. Genesis arrives like a little of the three, trying to offer a new breath of life for this saga of Sarah and John Connor, trying to rescue concepts used mainly in Terminator and The Final Judgment and merging its iconic elements in order to create a hybrid that brings the franchise to today's standards. restart the franchise with a mix of reboot, remake, prequel and sequel within a single film. Unfortunately, not everything works.In 2029, human resistance against machines is led by John Connor (Jason Clarke). Upon learning that Skynet sent an exterminator into the past with the aim of killing his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), before his birth, John sends Sergeant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984, intending to ensure her safety. However, when Reese arrives he is surprised by the fact that Sarah is guarded by another T-800 exterminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), sent to protect her when she was a child.Genesis, therefore, right in its initial third brings an emblematic change within everything that was presented in its predecessors: it is a new beginning (as the title itself makes quite clear) and, above all, a new possibility for the future. In terms of concepts, the film manages to rescue tones very similar to those used in the first two films - the sense of urgency is maintained through different fronts, engaging the viewer in something more than a simple visual spectacle. The beginning of the film is promising and provides an incredible fan service, playing with the timeline of the franchise in what appears, in fact, to be a tribute to the original, beginning with decisive moments of the war against Skynet in the future, at the exact moment when that the machines lose a battle to humans and send the cyborg T-800 to Los Angeles in 1984 as a last resort. Meanwhile, the Resistance commanded by John Connor sends Sergeant Kyle Reese, who is actually his father, for the same time. So far, the film is exciting to show the mixture with the passages of the original film, practically copied frame by frame of the James Cameron film. It was amazing to see the arrival of the T-800 and Kyle Reese exactly as it did in the original again. The tributes work very well, even with a great re-creation of the scenarios and costumes of the 1984 film, and the story even gets excited due to the nostalgia provoked in the viewer, but when entering its second act, where the action begins to develop and the script starts its biggest plot twists, everything starts to go wrong.Instead of meeting a helpless Sarah Connor in front of a murderous cyborg, he meets an armed warrior to the teeth in the company of a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger, returning to the role he has not played since Terminator 3 (2003) And the surprise doesn't stop there: almost at the same time, a model T-1000 exterminator (Lee Byung-hun) also appears with the mission of exterminating everyone, a very different past from what John Connor had told and which makes Kyle - as well as the entire audience - get completely confused. And to add to the confusion, Sarah tells Kyle that an exterminator was sent in 1973 to protect her after her parents' death and plans to travel in 1997, in a time machine built by ""Papi"", to destroy the Cyberdine company, which created Skynet, however, Kyle tells Sarah to instead go to 2017, because during his time travel he had a vision of himself when child n- with a system called Genesis, which will make Skynet control the entire planet. They go to 2017 and there they find their son John who works on his own time machine at Cyberdine and who was turned into an exterminator, called T-3000, by Skynet.
The script by Laeta Kalogridis, Patrick Lussier forces the audience to readjust their expectations in the face of what they thought they already knew about that universe, this revelation is intriguing and promising: how did the other Terminator become Sarah's protector? Who sent you? And under what circumstances? What are your guidelines? Could it reveal the full role of Cyberdyne Systems in the future of humanity? Could Sarah get Miles Dyson? In fact, if Cyberdyne started to develop Skynet when it discovered the arm of the original Terminator and it no longer exists, would this already prevent the existence of the project? Unfortunately, no matter how relevant these issues are, the film decides to simply ignore them, contenting itself with showing the T-800 by rescuing Sarah from the new villain and judging, from then on, that nothing else matters. Instead, he prefers to bet on twists and turns that usually involve someone saying something like ""I was sent for the year ..."" and that result in more questions that can ruin the previous ones without even answering them. Genesis seems to believe that the supposedly complex plot replaces the need to better develop the characters, who end up presenting themselves as unidimensional and uninteresting figures.Evidently, the text's biggest problem is getting lost when telling the story, after all it deals with time travel. With this extremely complex theme, it is normal to contradict the narrative line and destroy the already weakened logic of the series. Unfortunately, without escaping this curse, Genesis fails here. ""Genesis"" starts to go wrong when it mixes these two possibilities as it suits, generating several moments where nothing makes much sense, because the concepts start to cancel each other out. Thus, a festival of random events begins that slowly spoils the film. The film never shows the same concern for sounding plausible when developing the plot itself, as at one point, a character even goes so far as to say that killing Sarah and / or Kyle before they conceive John Connor wouldn't make any difference in the timeline - a stupid resource for the viewer to fear for the fate of the characters even though they have not yet had the opportunity to produce the savior of humanity. In addition, ""Genesis"" introduces a countdown to highlight the tension just to make it irrelevant at the climax, when time passes in a random fashion.It is important to highlight the good work in the direction of Alan Taylor, responsible for ""Thor: The Dark World"" and some episodes of the ""Game of Thrones"" series. Doing what was possible with the script he was offered and he does very well in recreating the scenes from the original film and in all the action scenes, explosions, chases etc. The visual effects are excellent and the current technology allows you to do the technical juggling that was previously done manually in the first two classics of the series. The director and team treat the original work with a lot of respect - at least as far as the image is concerned. The sequences that pass in the apocalyptic future and in 1984 are very faithful to the visual conception of James Cameron in his original feature. These scenes were even filmed on film, which guarantees a unique, nostalgic look. In addition, director of photography, Kramer Morgenthau used lighting techniques and planning characteristic of the 1980s - grainy image, unique points of light to illuminate the third plane, fog, strobe lights, high backlight and hard light for the key light. It is a spectacle of nostalgia.In the cast, Emilia Clarke, like the new Sarah Connor, effectively manages to embody the iconic warrior. In addition to having a slight physical resemblance to Linda Hamilton, the original Sarah Connor, she convinces as the anti-machine guerrilla with a strong personality. Schwarzenegger is great in the character that enshrined him, bringing that same expressionlessness of the previous films, but adding some new nuances to the character, showing everything he learned by spending so much time with young Sarah. Of course, we still have all your catchphrases present, jokes that could not be missing. The duo is the film's great comic streak, making it a lot funnier than the others in the franchise, which turns out to be no bad thing. Jai Courtney, however, does not shy away from the typical action movie hero, bringing nothing new to the franchise. J.K. Simmons plays a police officer who could have been completely cut from the script, making his appearance sound like yet another marketing ploy due to the success of ""Whiplash"". The only one that really draws our attention (besides Schwarzenegger) is John Connor himself, played by Jason Clarke, who guarantees greater depth to the character, but I can't say any more so as not to spoil surprises within the work.""Genesis"" is a work that ultimately adds nothing. It does criticize today's society, the ""stay connected"" that dominates our lives, but it does so in a superficial way, sounding more like a convenient use of today in order to reach more viewers. The excess of new information that confuses the story to the point that the characters have to explain all the time about time travel, alternative reality, etc. This new information not only messed up but distorted the original script and idea created by director and screenwriter James Cameron. With a plot full of flaws and without originality, it is so generic that it easily mixes with the countless action films released every year. Unfortunately, the film simply does not justify its existence within the mythology of these films and fails to explore its main novelty - John Connor."

In an action movie? After being California Governor? Again as Terminator? it's like the more people get old, the more dumb they are: what was to say has been said and the time is just to move on...2) T5 = T1+T2+X-Z : The plot is totally stupid, unbelievable and it's amazing that people has believed into it: they rip-off the best scenes of the two movies and add new crap and the result is just indigestive! At first, T2 story was weak as it's like the original 1984 movie: into the past to kill SC. So here we have the same story told another time and it's just too much: in fact, for Hollywood, a sequel is the same story as movie 1 but with a few changes. When they will understand creative art is not that, maybe we will got decent movies!3) You'll expect to see a monstrous movie with never seen before special effects and breathtaking action as this movie is made 30 years after the original! But NOT! as today movies, you can notice that movie have rather degraded: now, you have only 2 sort of scenes: the daylight in orange, the night and interior in blue: before, we got technicolor and full colors! So now every movie looks the same and it's too hard to get my interest!So this movie is just good for trash... With its no-quality records, i laugh hard when i heard about T6:Dark fate! again into the past to kill SC, again Schwarzie, again Linda Hamilton fighting at 62, again, again, the same story!

*Jai Courtney is severely miscast as Kyle Reese, lacking the seriousness and charisma of Michael Biehn's portrayal)
*the film's PG-13 rating like Salvation's, rather than being R-rated.
*the marketing campaign for the movie revealing arguably the BIGGEST twist in the trailers, the twist being that John Connor has been transformed into a villainous terminator himself.
*some of the campiness of the film is a bit cringeworthy at times (some of the jokes and misused callbacks to the earlier movies).
*the lack of using more practical effects than CGI, something the first 4 Terminator films were using pretty well.
*not being directed as a sequel to Terminator: Salvation. would have been nice to see a sense of continuity!the film comes in second-last place in the franchise for me, last place being Salvation. although there are a huge bunch of mistakes/flaws in the film, i can still really enjoy it after 5 years, like any Terminator movie really. the film gets a 7.5/10 from me, half a star more than Salvation. if you're going to go see this film, whether it be at a friend's, on DVD or somewhere on the internet - don't judge it by the standards of the previous, much better Terminator films (T1, T2) - watch it with low expectations and it'll sit with you a lot better!"

(R)Once again, John Connor (Clarke) sends back Kyle Reese (Courtney) to protect his mother, Sarah (Clarke), from the T-800 cyborg (Schwarzenegger)...except when he gets there, he finds out that the timeline has been fractured--Sarah is a seasoned warrior instead of an innocent waitress, and multiple Terminators are running around ready to duke it out over the fate of the planet. Attempt to reboot/revitalize the shaky franchise is interesting in concept but foolish in execution. The splintered, overlapping paradoxes are described to near-parodic levels; revisiting several scenes from the original film (echoes of ""Back to the Future Part II"") are often awkward, and just remind how much better the filmmakers were the first time around. Efforts to add irony and tongue-in-cheek references land flat pretty much every time, even turning Sarah and Kyle into bickering rom-com caricatures whenever the pyrotechnics cool down. As for those pyrotechnics, only the battles with Lee's liquid metal monster provide excitement; the rest are ruined by low interest coupled with mediocre direction and effects. Weathered and neutered by weak writing as he may be, it's still nice to see Arnie back in the role that made him an international star.38/100"
" Good film despised by troglodytes
",0.0516,0.9709,2020-03-21 00:00:00,7,"This is a pretty good film. Great acting (Schwarzenegger, the Clarkes and the incredibly creepy Lee Byung-hun in particular), great music, great special effects, good cinematography, and it manages to have a lot of funny moments without spoiling the movie's action-drama theme. The plot is a bit complicated, but that also makes it intriguing, and I love the various spins they did on the original (like the scene with the punks, where it seems to be identical to Terminator 1 at first). I thought the movie's message about today's dependence on digital technologies was interesting, given that Terminator isn't really a franchise known for its philosophical depth.Unfortunately, these kind of movies bring out rock-living dinosaurs who feel an urge to crusade against them for the cardinal sin of ""murdering"" their old beloved movies, especially when, as in this instance, they try to pursue new and innovative plotlines. Of course, when remakes merely clone the original, they still get an earful from these nostalgia-addled greybeards for replacing outdated practical effects with million-dollar CGI so the new younger generation who grew up in the twenty-first century won't laugh at them. While these critics may fill their angry reviews with platitudes like ""cynical"", ""soulless"" and ""cash grab"" and pick nits with greater ferocity than a North Korean child looking for something to eat, in the end their only real crime is being new, and belonging to a new generation.

The only thing remotely interesting, is that Arnold was a T1000 by the conclusion, that's the only thing I was looking forward to seeing in a sequel.

It was great! The ending was sad, but it was overall, great!Terminator 3 - The fight between T-X and Terminator was great! Surprised how the Terminator has to keep coming to the past to help John Connor and his family.Terminator Salvation - It was different! It was okay, but not compared to the first to the third movies. It showed Schwarzenegger in a CGI form as a Terminator fighting with Marcus Wright and John Connor. It was pretty good though. It's still worth watching!Terminator Genisys - Surprisingly, good! You see young Sarah helping with the Terminator, along with young Kyle Reese. Of course, there was a twist to it. John Connor, or T-3000, is the villain in this, which is shocking!

The aim of Genisys was to give the Terminator series an alternative timeline reboot: like what happened to the Star Trek movie franchise. What Skydance created was a film that lifts scenes and ideas from the first two Terminator film, and the Sarah Connor Chronicles. This is endemic of the lack of story ideas available to the Terminator franchise.Whilst it is a rehash, Genisys does have some solid action sequences, especially scenes set in the 1980s.

The plot holes in this film are plentiful, and some of the special effects are shoddy, especially with the T-800 in the beginning, I'm mean wow...the idea of the the infiltrators looking human, is to look human and not like an empty shell. And the worst part is turning the hero of the franchise into a terminator, that would be cool right? wrong, and then have it altered the timeline, so we can do more idiotic ideas. I will say the reason why this movie gets a 4 from me, is because I really loved seeing Arnold as the T-800 again in the good role. But obviously it wasn't enough too save this stupid and worthless remake or whatever it is. Just a rinse and repeat, apparently it's too difficult to come up with original material, so maybe this should be a good time to stop making Terminator movies, I mean look what happen with Dark Fate, just drive the stake in farther, you've already killed the franchise just stop no more."

Three ""proper"" films (sorry not sorry 'Salvation'). And the eponymous T-800 still fights to protect Sarah Connor. Or kill her? Father her? Build a secret lair with her? Honestly, the franchise's plot is so convoluted now, that any future instalments would contribute absolutely nothing to its paradoxical nature. Genisys being a perfect example. A rehash of 'T2'. Y'know, the most successful entry. Kyle Reese is sent back in time to save Sarah Connor (again...) but ends up in an alternative timeline which sees Skynet masquerade its conception through an operating system known as Genisys.Much like the title, the story makes no sense. Kyle is first sent back to 1984 so that both 'The Terminator' and 'T2' can be recreated with modern lifeless special effects. Scenes, such as the liquid T-1000 hunting down the protagonists, are presented again with no real reason other than to leech off of nostalgia. Except the constant barrage of narration, characterless personalities and chaotic splurge of visuals unsurprisingly hold no levity in comparison to the originals. The entire first half of Genisys is filled with this requirement for nostalgia and remained utterly pointless throughout, reminding you to watch the earlier films instead.Then over the halfway mark, Kyle and Sarah are sent forward in time to 2017, which commences Genisys' own story arc for the franchise. Unfortunately though, too late. Attentive hold has dissipated, leaving you wondering ""why the hell is JK Simmons in this?"" instead of being invested in the plot. Frustrating really, as the last forty minutes were surprisingly enjoyable. The visual effects were implemented well, sublime integration of sound mixing and shockingly developed an emotional attachment to the ""old"" terminator. I know right! Arnie's awkward smiling actually paid off!In contrast though, Courtney and ""J"" Clarke, whom both are renowned for monotonous performances, were emotionless. More emotionless than a frickin' cyborg nosediving through helicopters and stuff! Poignant moments such as Kyle discovering that John is his son, should've exhumed a palpable connection. Alas, no chemistry was present. The same can be said for Courtney and ""E"" Clarke. The latter gave everything she could to elevate the script and emotionality of any scene, cementing herself as a highlight. The former? Nothing. Dead on arrival. Looks like a beefcake, smells like one too.Genisys is subjectively better than the bleak cloud of depression that is 'Salvation', but that's like comparing a digital watch to an analogue watch. Both perform the same task, yet one will acquire a personal preference. And yes, I just used a watch analogy to sum up this review."

The CGI and visuals are gorgeous, the 27% on Rt is in no way a way do describe this amazing film, i have seen Jurassic World about 4 times and they just overused the CGI to the point where the film wasn't all that impressive, CGI wise.

It needs to be real struggle and a real killing machine (that doesnt intend to give a dramatic cold stare when its struck by a bullet, but instead, do something more killing machine like). The terminator process was softened significantly. It stems from the main actress.

The look & cinematography is stunning & the music was great & the cast was really good too such as Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor she was excellent i really liked her but the mega beefed up Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese is abit bland & way too pumped up in my opinion & Jason Clarke as John Connor was really good & a solid serious performance!!! To cast was really good & all new faces except for the unreplacable Schwarzenegger.The Action is big,fast & furious & there is some amazing action scenes such as the bus & bridge sequence that is fantastic!!!
The fx are obviously outstanding as this is a huge mega budget movie & an excellent film in the franchise, i like ""Genisys"" more than ""Salvation"" & ""T2"" & ""T3"" so IT'S a classy well made special fx crazy blockbuster film & thats absolutely fine by me!!! It's a popcorn fun sci-fi action Thriller with the legendary Schwarzenegger back for more but even i admit it's nothing special just some big budget fun.
There's still relevant elements such as everything being controlled by machines & technology & everything is uploaded on line & everything is controlled by A.I, it's a fun concept that rings true.
I liked the time travel element & the scenes that go back to the original movie of 1984 are Amazingly well done & totally recaptured that dark 80's look & tone of that CLASSIC!!!
I actually look at ""Genisys"" as a sequel/companion piece to just the 1984 original film, it works better that way.
Also gotta mention a nice small by great role for J.k Simmons as a detective & he's always great on screen.
This is just as impressive & as exciting & fun as even Terminator 2 (1991) in my opinion, now this may not be a masterpiece but it will be a Cult favourite in the future I'm sure.

Casting proved to be flawed, as none of the actors seem right for their parts, even though they try their best and convey somewhat a dignified portrayal, which is simply not enough. Emilia Clarke brings her young vibrant Sarah Connor to life decently. Arnold does what he does best, and Jason Clarke in my opinion delivers a more passable John Connor than, let's say, Christian Bale.At some point, sadly we must come to terms with Terminator films being over, because if Hollywood continues to extend this franchise putting out unimaginative and uninspired efforts such as this, they are going to end up destroying it irreparably for good. So, unless they bring creative and talented minds to work, they should just let Terminator die.So why a 6 rating?

No question that for some hardcore Terminator fans,the return of Arnold is enough.Too bad that the franchise was ruined in this new Terminator film as the saga was been completely altered which made the events of the first four Terminator films irrelevant and complete pointless.Added to that, we also see the complete downward trajectory of the franchise as it lost its heart completely.Overall,this new film brought the Terminator franchise completely. Good thing that ""Terminator:Dark Fate"" was released in 2019. But apparently,it was presented as continuation of the first two Terminator film - Terminator (1984) and Terminator:Judgement Day (1991) - as it basically tried to completely ignore the other sequels of the franchise such as ""Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines"" (2003), ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009), and this film known as ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015)."

Genisys experiments with certain plot ideas, such as 'what if Sarah Connor was raised by a Terminator', 'Arnold vs Arnold' & 'Sarah already knowing about Judgement Day'. These in themselves makes for a fun and entertaining movie.... but they added another plot point which not many were happy about... 'turning John Connor into a villainess Terminator' which went against the whole Terminator completely."

" In contrast to Dark Fate this one is not that bad.
",0.431,-0.8225,2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"When I watched this movie back in 2015 I had very high expectations. I wanted to see Emilia Clark playing Sarah Connor, the trailers make her look amazing and also Arnie was coming back...awesome. I left the theater sad and confused...very confused...I was really disappointed for how convoluted they make this sequel that partially ruined the timeline of The Terminator and T2.
However after watching the absolute pile of garbage that Dark Fate was...and how disrespectful to the characters has been I decided to watch the whole franchise all over again...I started with The terminator and T 2...And then I skipped T3 and Salvation and went straight to Genesys.. And I was amazed to finf Genesys far better sequel to T2 than Dark fate...to the point of not even close. Genesys is a lot of fun and is funny...yes it screws up the timeline to the point of no return...but still respects the characters of Sarah, Reese and the T-800. U don't like what they did with the script but at the very least they respect the characters and their legacy...When i left the theater in 2015 I would have rate this movie 2/10 but now that i compare it with a lesser sequel..I can say that this movie as generic action film deserves a 8/10...As a sequel to Terminator maybe I'll give it a 5/10. that brings the total to a 6,5/10 so I give it 7 stars. Is unfortunate and almost laughable that such an atrocity like Dark Fate played a role in me at second view to value this disappointing film some more. Who knows..if they keep destroying this franchise they will make another sequel that will make Dark Fate look like Citizen Kane in contrast... Is that what Hollywood is doing?"
" Considering what it had to live up to this is a surprisingly good effort
",0.6249,0.9969,2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"In the near future, robots controlled by a corporation called Skynet become self-aware and seeing mankind as a threat to them start to wipe out humanity. A small team of survivors (lead by John Connor) decide to fight back and manage to destroy Skynet. However, Skynet had a protocol in place to send a Terminator back in the past to terminate the mother of the leader of the resistance (if they were to lose the war) to prevent them being wiped out again in the future. Fearing for his future existence John sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother, but John is unaware of the slightly altered past Kyle is being sent back to and is also unaware and unprepared for a guardian who is already watching over and protecting Sarah...Before I started watching this film I did fear the worst; after all it's the fifth film in a franchise that has been a little up and down over all after the first 2 films, but for me I'm pleased to say that this fifth film was a fairly solid offering.Although it seems to begin as a re-tread of the original film Genisys does slowly start to unravel and expand upon its plot - this is explained more when Kyle is sent back to the past. I did like the way that Skynet's evolution was expanded upon and explored here and the idea that computers could soon be taking over us all seems more like social commentary or science fact rather than the science fiction that such a concept could once be deemed as. In the main this is an entertaining film, but that's really what you have to both understand and expect with this film. James Cameron only directed the first 2 films (the best in the franchise by a mile) and had little involvement in any of the sequels aside from being credited as creating the characters. For me, his absence has been noticeable in each of the sequels - in this film it lacks the dark edge of the original films and almost has a comical feel to it; Taylor has given this film a light-hearted feel, but to be fair I didn't find it detrimental here and liked some of the comical touches it's just that it may not be for all tastes.It's fair to say that all the Terminator films (to some degree or another) have had time-travelling figuring in to the plot albeit to varying degrees, but in Genisys this becomes both a strength and a weakness. The strength to is that it allows for a richer and deeper plot and a greater expansion to the story (theoretically). The weakness with it is that it can make a film come across as messy and over-written and unfortunately at times Genisys does play out like this. The plot twist involving John Connor is silly and his transformation from hero to villain isn't that convincing. I liked Jason Clarke's performance overall, but I preferred him as a good guy in all honesty as I never found him particularly intimidating or terrifying as a villain. I would have preferred it if Byung-Hun-Lee who played the T1000 in the 1984 era would have featured more prominently as he was excellent and was very close to being as good as Robert Patrick was in Terminator 2.As far as the rest of the cast go then to be fair they do all do a very good job; Arnie is given more opportunity to be human here (which is explained in the narrative) and for me this is one of his strongest performances within the franchise. Emilia Clarke is solid in her role as Sarah Connor although she lacks Hamilton's tough edge, but given Taylor's light-hearted approach I don't blame Emilia as I suspect she was just following orders. Courtney is no Michael Biehn, but again I didn't think he put on a bad show here. Simmons is a good actor, but didn't have much to do here although it was nice to see him play a good guy here rather than cocky/arrogant or obnoxious characters that I'm usually used to seeing him portray.The special effects are OK although they are disappointing given the passage of time that has passed since 1991. Aside from some of the FX used on John Connor and an Arnie vs Arnie showdown they don't actually look that much more advanced than the first sequel that came out nearly 25 years earlier. Incidentally, whilst the early scenes pitting good Arnie vs bad Arnie are impressive from a modern technology perspective their fight scene does look clumsy and has a very artificial feel to it (we all know it's real Arnie facing a CGI special effect of himself, but the audience should still be able to feel that they are watching Arnie fight a younger version of himself, but it's all too obvious that this isn't happening here which did reduce the impact of this scene as far as I was concerned).Still when looked upon on an expectations vs outcome I can definitely say that the outcome far exceeded my expectations and for those who have enjoyed the franchise so far (including T3 and Salvation) I think that you'll enjoy this one even in spite of the weaknesses that I have mentioned."

Then enter Jai Courtney. I could just about get my head around a new Sarah Connor, and Emilia Clarke does a passable job, but Jai Courtney as Reese? That, plus the complete lack of any chemistry between the two of them and the heart of this film is seriously impaired.That alone might not have been ""terminal"" for this film but then they went and turned John Connor into the new Terminator. Ok, on paper I get it, what a twist, but then you give that twist away in the trailers???The saving grace for this film was Arnold doing Arnold and the way they weaved in his actual ageing frame was clever. He just needed a better supporting cast to really reboot this series.All in all an ok ride, the opening scenes and the bit where they trap the new T-1000 were cool and set a pace and tone that I thought would continue, sadly we get a little lost in all the time travel and John Connor as a Terminator robot Skynet machine man nonsense."

GENISYS IS EXCELLENT, TERMINATOR DARK FATE TOTALY DESTROYS THE FRANCHISE & IT CAN NEVER RECOVER FROM IT.
Genisys has superb action & cgi effects, of course its an action movie T2 is an action movie & T1 is an action MOVIE, if the financial backing & cgi effects James Cameron had in 91 were available in 84 T1 would have been an even bigger action movie, it wasn't Shakespeare for goodness sake, Cameron bought the rights to a short story about a cyborg travelling back in time he juiced it up rewrote the characters and hey presto he gave us the terminator pretty much the same way stallone did with rambo.
The terminator trilogy was done it's been played out the only way forward now is to either remake it or reboot it, like it or not that's the only way to keep the franchise going & Genisys is just about the best way to start a new trillogy of movies without destroying the old, it keeps all the characters from the original to play out new story's, obviously you can't keep all the original actors so you have to cast new ones, but as I said this is now done & dusted because the new movie takes a huge dump all over the franchise & burys it for good using awful characters, a totally rubbish plot & some of the worst cgi I've ever seen & action sequences so over the top it makes the fast & furious movies look like go cart racing"

Not as good as T2 but still a nice refresh after T4. So... if T4 has a rating of 6.5 this one is at least 7.5 (maybe even slightly more).The only reason some people criticize it is because it insults their ""cellphone"" culture. It suggests that Android, iOS, Facebook, Instagram and other spying apps are the root of human destruction.And for telling them the truth, they hate the movie. As is usually the case. I think those viewers should stop acting like little insulted princesses, and accept that this is the 3rd best Terminator movie (after T2 and T1)."

All the actors, Emilia and Jason Clarke, and especially Jai Courtney that is so out of his comfort zone from his day job as a model, are all excellent pretenders in Terminator Genisys. Jason Clarke has never played a tough guy in a role before, so naturally it was an ironic but excellent choice to give him the role as the hard boiled tough guy John Connor. Emilia Clarke as a young and rebellious teenager? Sure why not! Schwarzenegger as pops? Wow, I never expected that! We all know that Terminators are excellent at pretending to be human, so it's only natural that these actors pretend to be the original cast from the previous films, and I say they do a great job at it!

However like Salvation it's one of the weaker ones but I do enjoy this one slightly more.Being a sequel but kind of a soft Reboot of the franchise this has an interesting story that changes and pays some homage to the first two films.
I really like the ideas this one brings with the Timeline being altered and everything changes it adds something different to the series.I also really like the John Conner terminator that was an interesting and unique idea for the franchise.However like Salvation I do have issues with this one the acting isn't great Emilia Clark was miscast as Sarah Conner in my opinion Iike her but she doesn't suit this character.
Jai Courtney as Kyle Reece is OK but nothing special.Arnie is great in this one as always he suits this character so much and he plays it to perfection.
Jason Clarke is really good as John Conner and is a great villian. However The T1000 is a little waisted in this one bit dissapointing.However solid action and a unique idea with the time travel element and an altered Timeline really safe this one and make slightly better than Salvation.Verdict 7.5/10 a fun action film and a unique premise that adds something new some mediocre acting makes one of the more weaker ones but still fun."

" An Unnecessary Entry in the Terminator Franchise
",0.0,0.9931,2019-10-09 00:00:00,4,"Terminator Genisys, the fifth entry in the Terminator franchise, is a movie that doesn't seem to have a purpose beyond financial motives. It is clear that the filmmakers were inspired by the success of J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" and have gone down a similar path of trying to create a film that is both a continuation of the original movies while also being a reboot. Unfortunately, it doesn't work half as well here.One of its main flaws is the fact that it seems to undo the timeline of the two original science-fiction classics in the franchise, a strange choice given their beloved stature among film fans. While it is refreshing initially to revisit iconic scenes from James Cameron's 1984 film, the novelty soon wears off, and it becomes convoluted and tiresome.The best aspect of the movie by far is the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to the franchise after his omission from the previous instalment. He slips seamlessly back into the role in which he was born to play. He is by far the most likeable member of the cast and brings excellent humour throughout. Emilia Clarke is fine in the role of Sarah Connor but can't match Linda Hamilton's iconic portrayal. The relationship between Sarah and the T-800 is much different in this film to previous entries, with Arnold acting as a father figure. This new dynamic works surprisingly well, however, and is one of the stronger parts of the movie. Jai Courtney is very bland and forgettable as Kyle Reese. He does not come close to the likability that Michael Biehn brought to the role in the original, and the chemistry between himself and Clarke is non-existent.Another major misstep that the film takes is turning John Connor into the villain. It feels like a cheap twist and never really works. Given that the second half of the film revolves around Sarah and Reese trying to kill their son, there is no emotion to be found. It feels like a generic action movie with no stakes, unlike the original two entries in the franchise, which this calls back to far too often, merely reminding the audience how much better those films are.While the majority of the special effects are fine, the de-ageing effects used on Schwarzenegger are less than convincing, with the fight sequence between young and old versions of Arnie feeling like two CGI characters hitting each other.In the end, I was left was wondering what the point of it all was. It didn't add anything new or exciting to the franchise, and it simply made me want to go back to watch Jim Cameron's original films. A post-credit scene is included with the intention of getting the audience excited for another instalment, but after this film, I feel it's time to bring the series to an end."

Combine that with granpa Arnie nursemaiding the heroes through their crises and it all feels a bit silly and plodding.
The supposedly nail-biting, will-they-make-it moments are rather predictable. Both the John Connor and Kyle Reese characters are completely unconvincing. John Connor bears little relation to his character in the previous films and Kyle Reese is just bland. Apart from the VFX, the only thing that just about raises the film into the entertaining category is Emelia Clarke outshining the rest of the cast as a thoroughly believable Sarah Connor, along with a couple of comic moments by Arnie.
The only real reason for watching Terminator Genisys is to complete the story, which, having seen this, one hopes the makers now feel they have done."

However watching it again after home release, it has grown on me to become the favourite after the originals.The effects are brilliant and the story is decent. This was massively impacted in a negative way by the trailers giving away major spoilers and key twists. I am disappointed we won't be seeing the sequels to this.For me the only things that could have made this better apart from the lack of spoilers given, would have been to have had Robert Patrick CGI'd as the T1000. Possibly elements from T2 also. I would imagine this would have been touched on in the sequels if they'd have been made.If you haven't seen the trailers, you will enjoy this film to what was originally intended. If you have it will feel mediocre. However in my personal Terminator ranking, given the new trailers, I would put this one in the top 3 after T1 & 2. Given the choice I would much rather see a sequel to this (with Robert Patrick and elements of Linda Hamilton like Xmen days of future past did with old and new cast) than paying to see Dark Fate.

But worse in almost everything.So, about all the shortcomings in order:1) It's been 20 years, and primitive special effects are used. The second part was cooler!
2) Almost the entire film was shot in dark (almost black) colors. To see something, sometimes you need to strain your eyesight.
3) A completely non-captivating plot. Everything is so primitive and uninteresting that you look at the time when this nonsense will end.

But when you compare Genisys to Rise of the Machines and Salvation, Genisys gets my vote. I can still enjoy a movie and appreciate the story it's telling while also seeing what it didn't get quite right, but not dwell on it.I enjoy Genisys for what it is. It's fun, plenty of action and entertaining. And that's all I expect to see in a Terminator movie. For anyone who hasn't seen Genisys, I will always say give it a try and don't judge it based on critics reviews. See it for yourself and you may find you'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of T1 and T2, and Genisys is currently sat as my 3rd favourite in the franchise. Will Terminator Dark Fate take the 3rd place? Will Dark Fate be the true sequel to Terminator 2 that many of the fans have desired after all these years? Maybe, we'll see. Even so, I will always think of Genisys as a decent installment in the franchise."

",0.3459,0.8141,2019-07-09 00:00:00,3,"Oh, why oh why did they greenlight this project? 'Genisys' is a rehash of all the previous films and offers nothing new or original. Byung-Hun Lee tried so hard to mimic Robert Patrick's performance as the liquid metal T-1000, but he simply couldn't pull it off as brilliantly as Patrick did. Emilia Clarke was very weak as Sarah Connor (so stunningly portrayed by Linda Hamilton in the previous films). Clarke was simply not convincing.As for the plot, it was pretty much been there done that. This installment is completely unnecessary and the more they tried to explain where they fit in the timeline, the more they confused the story. So, John Connor - humanity's last hope - is now the bad guy??? This was cliche upon cliche and the visuals were not so great. The original Terminator movies were made over two decades ago and yet the CGI and visuals are far superior to the effects in this 2015 film. They use too little practical effects and rely too much on CGI, making the film look like a video game. CGI is definitely getting worse - probably because it is becoming more freely available and cheaper.Lets face it, if this was an original film, it would have been an ok watch, but as part of the franchise it was a yawner. I honestly don't know if I'm going to remember this, as there simply was nothing special or memorable about this film. (The only very good scene, was the bus chase scene). The action scenes were bland and boring. Oh, and off course Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible prevails. Yawn...next...!"
" A new direction
",0.0,0.8992,2019-07-06 00:00:00,6,"This review contains spoilers.'Terminator Genisys' is a 2015 science-fiction action movie. The movie is meant to be a soft-reboot of the Terminator franchise which takes the entire franchise in a new direction. The movie is directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis, and Patrick Lussier. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, and Jai Courtney. The story is a time-traveling tale as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese try to stop the new Skynet plot of Genisys.Terminator Genisys eschews the simpler time-travel stories of the earlier movies to create a narrative that utilizes time-travel many times during its 126 minute running time. This movie has characters operate in different timelines across flashbacks. The confusing narrative of time-travel in the Terminator movies is further exacerbated in this movie. There is simply too much time-travel in this movie and too many different timelines that the audience has to keep track of. The way that this movie soft-rebooted the Terminator franchise convinces me that the creators intended to make the overall narrative convoluted.Terminator Genisys has two new actors in the role of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. In this movie, Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor. This is a Sarah Connor that is not the same as the Sarah Connor from The Terminator movie. This Sarah Connor already knows about the existence of Terminator from the Terminator known as Pops. Emilia Clarke does an admirable job with the script she was given. It is simply not enough when everything underneath is not great. It felt like Emilia Clarke's Sarah Connor was already this impressive figure that created the future of the resistance. In this case, the audience never gets to see the journey that took her from a fragile waitress to a woman willing to prevent the apocalyptic future. Without seeing that, it made Emilia Clarke's performance much weaker as a result. It felt like she was an imitation Sarah Connor rather than a separate Sarah Connor from Linda Hamilton.Jai Courtney does not do a good job as Kyle Reese. Part of this rests on the script. The script did not have much for Jai Courtney to do in this movie. It felt like Kyle Reese was simply floating around rather than having important scenes in trying to protect Sarah Connor. Kyle Reese's only addition in this movie was to provide information to prevent the Genisys plot by Skynet. It was a plot that did not need to be this character's only focus. Kyle Reese should have been more useful to the overall narrative rather than to deliver that piece of information then lounge for the rest of the movie.The twist with John Connor, played by Jason Clarke, is an incredibly baffling twist. John Connor is turned into a T-3000 by Skynet. He then executes the Genisys plot in the past. This entire plot is ridiculous as it the movie needed to create an unstoppable villain like the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie needed to do this as the plot had already showed Sarah Connor and Pops easily destroying the T-1000 in this movie. They created a nearly unstoppable terminator that has John Connor's personality simply to present a large obstacle to the resistance members. This plot change creates an incredibly messed up and unnecessary change in the Terminator series. It makes me believe that nothing in the rest of the movie series will matter anymore. The movie here does not establish new characters and it leans too much on the old.The action in this movie is overall good and is the only saving grace in this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is solid as the Terminator as always. It was fun watching the old scenes play out with the twist. Even if none of it made sense, the movie is still overall fun to watch simply to see the increasingly ridiculous scenes the writers inject the main characters into.I do not recommend 'Terminator Genisys'.Grade: D"
" so frustrating but still pretty enjoyable with some amazingness
",0.7937,0.986,2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,"First couple viewings: I'm distraught. some of this movie was awesome but a lot of it was average. the story was confusing and overly convoluted, and I am saying that knowing the story of the first four movies very well, and having watched all four just before watching this one. the action was great at times and mediocre at others. great musical score. the actor playing John Connor was ok, and jai Courtney was his usual sucky self. Arnold was great4th viewing: i really thought i only watched it twice. i had to bump it to a 6/10, partly because i keep coming back to it, and also because i really had a great time with it. i basically ignored all the stupid stuff i hated about where they went with the story. and i laughed at the cheesy parts. and i thoroughly enjoyed a BEASTLY action movie. the biggest surprise from my previous review is the way i felt about the action, not sure how i thought a lot of it was mediocre. it was mostly awesome, with some insane scenes, and multiple jaw-dropping moments (4 viewings 11/1/19)
SPOILERS
first couple viewings: before I say what I hated, I think it was very cool the way they made Sarah Connor already be a warrior. I didn't mind that they added another part of the storyline before the first movie. I also thought it was very cool that the terminators had human teeth. Since they are made to be infiltration units, it only makes sense that the only exposed part of their body should be actual human parts. And it also lends credibility to why the terminators would round up all the humans in camps before executing them. that's where they got all the teeth! I also loved the evolution of how much a terminator can start ""feeling"" after being with the humans for that long. in the end he truly cared for Sarah Connor like a human would. brings me back to terminator 2 when Arnold said ""I know now why you cry""the actor who played Kyle Reese was terrible. He seems to play the exact same role as he did in die hard 5, which I also hated him in. Kyle Reese was born and raised in the time after judgment day. he didn't know anything but war, never loved a girl, and was extremely tormented psychologically. In Terminator 1 the actor played it perfectly. in this one he just tries to be a fun, cool bad-ass who makes jokes.but the thing that really killed the movie for me was the ridiculous turn they decided to take in the story of this series, which is to have John Connor become a terminator and attack his parents. I really tried to just go along with it but I couldn't. the first four movies were about John Connor being the savior of humanity and the most important person in the world, but in this movie he turns into a terminator and becomes the villain they need to destroy. why. why?! WHY!? like I said, I'm distraughtjust to be clear, I think the idea of melding metal and organic material in a human would have been awesome and a cool evolution of the terminators as they have done in the past movies. but why they would decide to make John Connor the person who turns into a terminator is just astonishing. also it is pretty contradictory that John Connor can remember all his memories but suddenly decides to do the exact opposite of what he's been trying to do for his entire life, destroy skynet"

There's some fun to be had in watching Arnie in his most famous role and some of the set pieces are well done (the bus scene in particular) it adds nothing to the Terminator franchise. Watch it on TV if you like but don't bother to buy it. Just rewatch the first two and marvel at how well made and original they were. The third film may not live up to those two but I rate it higher than this one."

",0.4926,0.9957,2019-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I love all the movies, but I found this film manages to recapture the emotional depth of the first two movies that was missing from the last two. I wanted a sequel at some point to feature additional time travelers including John Connor himself back during the original film. Genisys played up on similar ideas, so I thoroughly enjoyed this film.How does this fit in with previous movies? Kyle Reese appears to be from the original future as he was in the first movie. Arnold and the T-1000, I theorize that instead of being sent to the 90's for T2, they were sent to the 70's after Sarah Connor. T3&4 are ignored, but a fin idea. What if the embodiment of Skynet was from that timeline or another and kept jumping back until he reached the original future, because... reasons? He assimilates John Connor into the T-3000 and sends the T-1000 after Sarah Connor in the 70's. Next, John Connor T-3000 jumps back to 2015 in a new timeline to create another version of Skynet. Someone sends Pops back, and then the movie plays out. That's how I see it anyway.Jay Courtney's acting could have shown more emotion, but I really enjoyed this movie. I love how for once, we got a happy ending with all of our heroes alive. There's a tease that Skynet survived, naturally. Given T6 will ignore this movie, I'm happy with how it ended.People are too hard on movies today. It's entertainment. If it's bad, you don't have to hate it. Just watch something else. Breaking down the movie to explore why it failed, that's always fun though. Anyway..."

And I was really pumped when I heard that a new Terminator movie was coming out. I watched Terminator Genisys when I was about 12, and I liked it at the time. I just watched it recently, and I thought to myself, ""What was wrong with me back then, why did I like this movie!?""As you can tell, I really didn't like this movie. It was a hair's length away from being awful. Let's start with the cons, and there's a lot of them. The movie has a terrible script, and that's probably the worst part about it. It's so predictable, and every time they try to spice it up, it doesn't seem like a surprise because I can see it from a mile away. The acting is dull, especially from Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke. The action sequences are not very impressive. This movie feels like it copies from a bunch of good action movies and combines it into one big mess. This movie also recycles concepts from other Terminator movies, and it doesn't feel like its own thing.It has been announced that a new Terminator movie is coming out that completely ignores all the Terminator movies after Judgement Day, and I was really pleased with that. I hope that movie will be good, I really do. James Cameron is producing and writing that movie, and I really like that move. The only small redeeming part about Terminator Genisys is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I guess it was fun to see him again as the terminator. This movie is a disgrace to the Terminator franchise, and I'd give it a 2/10"

It got kind of a little stupid. Why would you do that to John Connors character?
That was ridiculous.
The script is the one thing that ruined it all. Can't blame the actors. They did fine. Seen better and seen worse by far.
How did this script get the green light!?I have not hated a single terminator movie. The first 2 are brilliant and the best. I don't care a lot for the 3rd but, it's not a bad movie.

" Time After Time... With Human Killing Machines!
",-0.69,0.9982,2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"When a franchise is reaching for it's fifth entry in the series, you usually expect it to be sucked dry of any interesting twists or dimensions. Terminator Genisys avoids that, by using the time travel aspect and mixing things up from how we all know the well-worn plot to go. It makes for some fun and entertaining movie magic, for a property we all thought had no juice left in it.Things all start as we know it before, with John Connor sending Kyle Reese (his father, who doesn't know he's his father yet) back in time to save his mother. But when Skynet jumps the gun and alters things at the moment of Kyle's time trip, what we thought we knew is no longer so. Kyle lands in the past to save Sarah Connor, only to learn that she doesn't need his saving and that everything has changed. They soon travel into the future to put an end to Skynet for good, only to find that Skynet's newest assassin is the last person they would expect! Will they be able to overcome someone they trusted and stop Skynet, or does this spell the final doom for all humanity?It was a lot of fun with the twists made in time, as you got to see scene that were familiar, yet also changed and different. It added a level of excitement, as you weren't sure what was going to happen next, much like in the first film. Arnold is back in the role that made him a superstar, although he didn't do as much of the physical stuff as in times past. It was nice to see him go up against himself in his prime, though. Emilia Clarke was great as Sarah, even managing to give some looks and reactions that straight up reminded me of Linda Hamilton. But this Sarah isn't as hard as Hamilton's became and is much more brooding in the fact she feels little control over her fate. A nice change from the Sarah we knew. Jason Clarke was adequate as John Connor. If nothing else he washed the bad taste out of my mouth that Christian Bale left with his turn as the character in Terminator Salvation (for which I am ever so thankful). Lastly, Jai Courtney had the unenviable task of filling the role Michael Biehn made a staple of the series. He does his best, but he lacked the cool intensity that Kyle Reese had. Of all the characters, his was the one that should have had the least amount of change, which only makes an unenviable task of playing him all the more difficult.Overall the performances are fine. While certainly not as great as some past outings, they hold their own against characters that have become icons to us. The action sequences are pretty good (if a bit subdued, mostly due to Arnold's age) and there are some nice twists on themes throughout the proceedings, as we watch everything that we know was changed come to fruition. If I had any real qualms, it was at the end with the footage during the credits. I know the desire to keep the franchise going is strong, but I'd rather this be the end and let it go out on a good note, rather than run it into the ground with more sequels.Terminator Genisys doesn't reinvent the wheel, so much as it contorts it so you don't realize it is the same wheel. It will never top the first two films, but then I doubt anything ever could. It does have enough action and plot twists to keep you guessing and entertained. It's a good, fun time at the movies! And isn't that what is most important?"

Like I said a lot funds wasted for something useless without any premise.The story tries to innovate bringing all the stories together but misses out the basics. Creating a good film.Anyway the story ends with a hope of a new universe. Let's hope how it'll perform. No expectations though."
" A classic American movie

" Has many faults, but is nonetheless watchable and admirably ambitious
",0.8338,0.9903,2018-11-24 00:00:00,6,"Terminator: Genisys is admirably ambitious in how it attempts to play with the mythology of the first two classic films by altering and combining crucial plot details within the first two Terminator films while extending upon them by having the heroes travel forward, rather than backwards, in time. I also felt that Terminator: Genisys was truer to the underlying premise of said films than the third or fourth: that there is no set fate. This may have been why James Cameron was more enthusiastic about this film than he was Terminator 3, which outright obviated that premise. However, incorporating and combining plot elements from the first two films will inevitably invite comparisons to them and regrettably Terminator: Genisys is a far worse film than either.The first problem is with the plot, despite having some interesting twists and variations on existing themes (such as the T-800 protecting rather than trying to murder Sarah Connor). The plot in the first two Terminator films was free of any plot holes. Unfortunately, the same is not true here. In this film, both the T-1000 and T-800 demonstrate capabilities that should have been beyond these models (being able to repair disabled Terminators, for example). Kyle Reese and John Connor both seem remarkably healthy, both physically and psychologically, given the inevitable trauma associated with losing family members and fighting an apocalyptic war. Plus one billion people pre-ordering an app is hard to accept.Additionally, the plot squanders many potentially interesting devices. For instance, the T-1000 is underused and the T-5000 is barely seen. The concept of the entire Connor family fighting Skynet, or even teaching it that annihilating humanity is wrong while it is in its more suggestible child-like state, is intriguing, but is never explored. Even the idea of the villain fighting his brainwashing would have made his potential death even more poignant given his relationship with the protagonists. The differences between 1984 and 2017 are also not remarked upon as much as one would expect from two people who have just travelled forwards in time. Also, the moral hazard associated with killing a blameless child-like creature is not reflected upon by the heroes.The direction is generally acceptable, with the viewer being able to clearly understand what is happening, but the CGI effects do not work quite as well as they did in Terminator 2. Some, like the T-3000, were indeed quite impressive but other scenes overused CGI, such as the helicopter chase, thus detracting from its believability.The dialogue tries to pay homage to the first two films by reusing lines, but it is also marred by some inconsistencies. John, if you are more than a mere machine, how can you say that the machines will rule the world? Are you saying that you will not rule the world on account of you not being quite a machine?The acting is a mixed bag. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a welcome addition. He is clearly no longer in his physical prime but he nonetheless adds some much needed levity to a serious film. Jai Courtney on the other hand is not great. He is physically impressive but that detracts from his credibility in the role given the travails his character endured would likely affect his physical health. Additionally, while he has some of Michael Biehn's intensity, he doesn't bring any of Biehn's humanity to the role. He simply doesn't behave like a normal human being and so lacks chemistry with the one-dimensional Clarke, who plays a generic 'strong woman'. Jason Clarke is a bit better, transitioning reasonably effectively from an affable hero into a menacing villain, but again his character seemed a little too well adjusted given what he endured. Matt Smith and Lee Byung-hun are underused, but both are purposeful and menacing in their roles. JK Simmons is just a novelty.In the end, while I've been critical of this film, I will say that I actually enjoyed watching it despite its many faults, not least because the pacing was quite good, with action scenes intelligently being placed throughout the film. Normally I would give a film this flawed a bare passing grade on the grounds that it is at least watchable, but I admire this film's ambition in playing with the first two classic films (with some success), even though it doesn't fulfil its boundless potential. Hence, I award:3/5 stars"

Also writer was stupid enough to change some principles which were basic in previous movies..in movie they even explain that when John conner says""say who!"" At this point they allocate new rules!it was like that the writer and director were saying we understand better than James Cameron!

This film attempts to answer them all, except why Hitler wasn't killed as a child.The basic plot is that the humans attempt to keep ""Judgement Day"" from happening (answers one of those questions) which now happens in 2017 with the alternate past/future nexus quantum thing. The same type of graphics was used as in previous films, as it appears we are peaking in CG capability. The aged Arnold is explained that the outer skin still ages. However it didn't explain Emilia Clarke. Hasta la vista, baby Linda Hamilton.

He was destined to be a star.The story is a ""what if"" scenario. It doesn't try to continue the original Terminator story, it takes a left turn and just creates a story many have thought about; ""What would happen if the Sarah Connor from Terminator 2 was in Terminator 1?"" Well, this is what happens. She doesn't mess around, she doesn't run and scream and cry, she doesn't have time to fall in love, she is out to kick butt and have been trained by her own personal Terminator to prepare for what is to come.Once again, the action is well done, and this movie ends in a cool battle between the Terminator and Terminator John Connor.

The 4th one(Salvation) had no fun at all. It was very different from all the other movies. Terminator is a very interesting concept but also I has to be entertaining as well.
This movie was a surprise for me. After watching Terminator Salvation I did not want to watch Genisys. And accidentally now, 3 years after its release I decided to give it a try. Oh boy it was perfect! So much action, so much fun. The plot was totally unpredictable!
Of course there are some serious gaps in the movie. When dealing with time travel and alternative realities, you can't get all the answers. 
Also the Genisys facilities were unguarded??
What happened to T1100 from the beginning of the movie?

Realizing their nightmare isn't over, they decide to stop running and focus on preventing the developing of Skynet. ¨The rules have been reset¨. 
 Nice follow-up with frenetic action , thrills , tension and suspense from start to finish . Interesting and twisted screenplay by Patrick Lussier based on characters created byJames Cameron .& 
Gale Anne Hurd . Pacing is just right in this thrilling and exhilarating non-stop action movie . There's a welcome sprinkling of deadpan humor to bring you relief from the bludgeoning action too . This is the first film in the series to not feature animatronic Terminators created by special effects artist Stan Winston, due to his death in 2008. Instead, the animatronics were created by effects studio Legacy Effects, an enterprise formed out of Winston's former workshop staff. An explosive thriller with Arnie repeating his known lines as ¨I'll be back¨ . Arnie develops enough traits and command of slang to bring additional veins of laughs to the almost un-stoppable and noisy action . And other cold-blooded villian on the starring's trail well played by Byung-Hun Lee as Cop / T-1000 . The twists and turns of time and logic will amaze you almost as much as the liquid metal effects and the highway chases .

First, in the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" they assigned leading role to Cersei, and now in ""Genisys"" they replaced her with Daenerys, and they change all the other actors as socks too... It's by itself enough to spoil the franchise, but of course, they did not stop just on that.The story is, to put it mildly, catastrophic. The cult sci-fi action, about machines taking over the Earth and the Connor family trying to stop them, has turned into a film about the complications caused by time travel. Bunch of jumping into the past and future, and paradoxes caused by it, has complicated the story so much that I am convinced that even the authors themselves are unable to explain it logically. The focus is completely transferred from the war between machines and people to these complications, and the film has completely lost the spirit of the franchise it is trying to round up. True, ""Genisys"" did round up and ended the franchise, but this kind of denouement (if something so knotted can be considered a denouement at all) desecrated the franchise on so many levels that I would prefer if they had left the story undetermined instead of making such a lousy happy-ending. Not only that John Connor is the villain in this movie, but the very ending looks like it escaped from some Disney fairy-tale. Yuck.Still, it is technically well-made and it is somewhat entertaining, so even if I would like to rate it much lower, I simply can not go below5/10"

I really enjoyed the fourth film Salvation. I don't know why people didn't like it. It was a good film.
Now Genisys started with some great ideas and I was getting really excited. Using elements of the first 2 films and creating something really hectic crazy. I was into it. 
Then it got stupid. In a lot of ways. 
I don't like to put spoilers in here, so I won't. But, one things is they ruined John Connor and all he is meant to be & stand for. 
Instead of tying in with the originals 2 films it actually crapped on hem and ruined their whole story and the point of John Connor. 
What a twist!? Yes. But, a stupid one. 
John Connor aside, the amount of jumping through time was getting too much. I understand time travel was a part of the first 3 films but, very minimal, the films didn't keep focusing on it. 
Anyway.... nothing wrong with the acting here. No best actor awards I'd give but, everyone was fine. It wasn't the actors faults that this movie is a mess. It's the story and possibly made worse by how it was put together. 
I'd recommend missing this one unless you can handle the mess it makes of the Terminator universe and just view it as a B-Grade flawed SciFi movie on its own."

",-0.1795,0.9943,2018-08-01 00:00:00,8,"I know it's not a huge favorite but no idea so much hate was being given to this movie. 
I loved the redux of a familiar and well loved plot of the original Terminator being twisted after several scenes completely the same. We get to see a little more backstory of future John Connor and Kyle Reese. We see the events leading up to the tactical time machine weapon being used. 
And while no one can ever replace the original actors portraying the characters, I feel like this new version of the movie series represents the heart of the series haunting refrain: the future is not set. This could be one of the many potential futures triggered by time travel. Arnold reprises his titular character. His character in his original youth - cgi special effects looking both plastic and odd but also fitting his robotic character. In a scene where we all know and love to see the 80's punks getting their butts beat up and killed, we see it interrupted by a much older, and grayer, Arnold. The younger plastic Arnold attacks, and we enjoy a fight between them.Later we see Kyle Reeces arrival and what starts out faithfully recreated also contains a new twist. Finally after a near death experience and a rescue, the plot is tweaked again, and we discover the rescuer is none other than Sarah Connor. I don't want to keep giving way the plot, so will only say that events and plot develop into an exciting movie. Give this a shot. Don't expect it to be a faithful and complete scene for scene recreation of the movie. And I'm thankful for that. I didn't want another remake but I think for this series with time travel being an integral part of the mythos that it makes sense. Great acting, decent writing and dialogue and limited exposition along with strong special effects support the plot. While many hate this movie, I applaud it. 
Is it perfect? Oh no. Never that. 
But. It's solid. And enjoyable. And I'm looking forward to this new version and future movies with same characters returning to delight me."

Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney look nothing alike. Speaking of Kyle, in the original Terminator he was lean, but muscular, and looked like a soldier but not too buff for someone who'd supposedly starved most of his life. Courtney, who plays Kyle in this film, looks like he hits the gym every morning and has glamour muscles. He also has none of the original scarring or any of the PTSD issues that Biehn's version had, and Michael Biehn is also a much better actor. I was not convinced that Courtney was Kyle Reese.And now for the worst part: like the title says, it was exactly as bad as I thought it would be. If it had been worse, it would have been enjoyably bad. If it had been better, well, that speaks for itself. But this was exactly as bad. There was a couple of funny lines here and there, and Arnold was alright in this movie, but the obvious CGI was shameful and I found myself angry that this movie was exactly what I thought it would be.

There is also a fun fight where Arnold fights his younger self. However by the time the second act kicks in the film becomes convoluted and starts to fall apart becoming a parody of itself. They re-filmed some of the stuff from the 1984 film like the shooting locations which look spot on and a really convincing CG recreation of a young Arnold. But the punks who get their clothes stolen look nothing like the ones from the first film. Put those two scenes side by side and you can tell instantly from their clothing and hairstyles that they look nothing alike, they just look like bad cosplayers. Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese was a poor casting choice as he bares little resemblance to the previous actor who played him and his acting is also very wooden. Emilia Clarke is great as Sarah Connor and she does look like Linda Hamilton from the 80's but towards the end she just becomes a little bit annoying. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks to be enjoying himself here but being in his late sixties he really needs to consider quitting. Yes they explain that cyborg skin ages like humans (which is a stretch even for these films) but it's just an excuse to keep him in the role for years to come. ""Old, not obsolete"" is his new catchphrase. The villain is quite interesting as its non other than John Connor merged with a cyborg (thank the trailers for ruining that twist). His abilities look visually stunning but he's wasted as he doesn't show up until the third act. There are too many plot threads going on throughout and the film loses it focus. There is some fun to be had and the action sequences are enjoyable but they don't really serve a purpose, they are just there for the sake of it. They tried to do something different with it but it just isn't enough for it to work as a Terminator film. Clearly a victim of studio meddling, it's just another needless sequel to the franchise which has run its course.

The famous speech in the first movie did not include the famous 'no fate but what we make' part, that was retrofitted into the 2nd movie. In the 2nd movie the extinction of the human race in 1997 was averted, then in the 3rd movie it ended up happening anyway in 2003. The 4th movie held onto all of this backstory and had John Connor married to Kate and looking for (and eventually finding) a teenager Kyle Reese to make sure he can send him back in time to be his father. This movie just ignores all of this, even before the timeline shift that occurs when Sky Net convert John Connor. The movie starts out with the extinction of the human race happening in 1997 which was averted in the 2nd movie, Kyle Reese is found by John Connor when he is still a young boy, the famous speech that was given to Kyle Reese now includes the famous 'no fate' line. All this before any timeline shifts.They people who made this movie could have paid better attention and had all of this recounted according to the way it went in the original 4 movies, it would not have adversely effected the rest of the movie at all. So, why did they botch this stuff up so badly?"
" (Avoid being Terminated by this horrible sequel)
",-0.628,0.0935,2018-05-29 00:00:00,4,A mediocre effort which shouldn't be mentioned in the same breadth as the first two films Genisys is hampered by a predictable plot and mediocre performances.

" WORST TERMINATOR EVER
",-0.6249,-0.9741,2018-05-25 00:00:00,1,"Let's start with the fact that all actors (besides Arnold) look nothing like the original actors. I've always been a fan of the terminator series, but the fact that they basically messed with the timeline to pretty much create an entire new one is ridiculous.I found Sarah Conner's new persona to be annoying. Not that the actress portraying her didn't do a good job, but the fact that Kyle was supposed to protect her and it turns out she is protecting him is a real strain on the original concept. It really got under my skin when she throws open the door and says ""Come with me if you want to live.""What was most aggravating was the fact that they turned John into the bad guy. What on earth? You spend an entire franchise building up John Conner the hero only to turn him bad? It's almost like they wanted to kill the franchise.This was by far the most aggravating and painful Terminator even though the other films were really enjoyable."

It had too many villains and one of the villains appeared briefly as a cop like the liquid metal T-1000, but had nothing to do with the movie. I loved it at first, until they had this frustrating twist of John Connor. In addition, Sarah Connor had a completely different back story shown from when she was nine years old that I didn't think was necessary either. The timeline of the first two has been severely altered, but I still love the first two the most. Out of the five Terminators, I rate this fourth place behind only T3."
" I don't think the franchise's constituent parts will survive this particular blast...
",0.0,-0.9542,2018-05-17 00:00:00,4,"Oh dear. What on Earth has happened here? It is as if Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron have conspired to travel back in time and destroy something fundamental to their existences as movie moguls! In The Bible, verse six of the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis speaks of how filled with pain God was at the fact he had even made human beings in the first place. In ""Terminator: Genisys"", it is as if the producers are the proponents of something resembling this pain and it is targeted at the first two entries of the Terminator saga! As far as anyone should be concerned, the Terminator franchise had reached a checkpoint of sorts in 2009 with ""Salvation""; a project which realised the only stories left to be told were the ones unfolding during the war in the future between man and machine. The preceding three had seemingly dealt with the past-set stuff, with ""Rise of the Machines"" in particular using as much of the margin as possible in its toying with the lives of the characters involved - even going so far as to change when judgement day happened in the first place. Thus, what remains but to tell the tale of the future war itself? 
Apparently there IS more story to be told, but in order to do that, we must first run a red marker line through the original films and begin anew whilst systematically attempting to doff our hats to them. ""Genisys"" is this continuation - a miserable effort at re-inflating the Terminator franchise which runs too long; does horrible things to its established characters; tells a clumsy love story; isn't funny when it thinks it's funny and bashes the frame with too much action. The film begins in 2029, but at the dog-end of the future war between Skynet and the rabble of survivors who came through its initial strike in the twentieth century, when it became aware that it needed to use our nuclear arsenals against us if it was to maintain its livelihood. John Connor (Jason Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) spearhead the final charge, to the extent we essentially 'catch up' on the moment the first film from 1984 begins: the machines, in an act of desperation, send an indestructible machine back in time disguised as a human to strike Connor's mother before he was born. This in turn, of course, causes Connor himself to send back a protector: Reese. But there is a twist in the flop - just as events play out in the way we remember them, Reese witnesses, from the swirling chaos of his time-travel force field, an event which endangers his human allies that was NOT part of the first film's spectrum. Consequently, he is deported off the back of a cliffhanger, and when it appears that the 1984 he was sent to does not match Connor's contemporary description, he knows something is amiss. It is to the filmmaker's credit that they bring to life the 1984 of the first film - that dark; night set; spotlight ridden urban sprawl - as well as they do, but this is as good as it gets. Essentially, the decision has been made to seemingly fuse the 1984 and 1991 films into one, as we learn that history now consists of something entirely different to what we all knew up to this point. Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is not the mousy, ignorant waitress she once was and has even acquired a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) of her own. The roles have been subverted: Reese is now the jabbering wreck begging Sarah to tell HIM what's going on... A number of things mark ""Genisys"" out as a failure: above all else, it is too heavy on the action front where the first two entries resisted this. One of the great triumphs of the 1991 sequel was, despite possessing a premise which encompasses two indestructible robots, its ability to rein the action in and resist just depicting mayhem. Besides cynically being there for the Korean market, actor Lee Byung-hun plays a T-1000 wrapped up in the new universe whose effects are not used sparingly enough. There was always something about the way Robert Patrick oozed through a prison door or dribbled back together again having been shattered apart - director Alan Taylor here just seems to decide none of us are able to sit still, and so must throw the farm at us within the first 20 minutes.Character-wise, in inverting the Michael Biehn-Linda Hamilton roles from the first film, you re-orientate the film to be about Reese finding himself in a new world/predicament and having to come to terms with that. Reese, already being a hardened solider where Sarah was not in Cameron's original, thus has very little to learn or do besides defend Sarah from the new enemy - something her T-800 can do more efficiently anyway. Thematically, the film is therefore not really about anything at all because its protagonist has nothing to learn. Many have jumped on the back of Courtney for his ""bad acting"" because of this, but he was never provided with anything to do in the first place. Disappointingly, after it plays its hand revealing its new ideas, and once you've ridden the nostalgia wave, the film beds down into a pattern of easy second unit material and a somewhat glib commentary on the role of machines in our lives: this time, it's smart phones and tablets to suit the age. But we have long since left the experience by the time the film tosses Bob Marley onto the soundtrack and has Schwarzenegger skydiving off a helicopter onto another one. I read that Genisys was part of a planned trilogy - let us hope not."
" Very good movie but Terminator fans are weird and hard to please
",0.3392,0.8313,2018-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Terminator 3 and Genisys were great, 2 and 4 were actually the weaker films of the series. 2 was a total rehash of the first, which was a great movie. I'm not really sure why this film got a lot of flak. I can only speculate it's from people who came in wanting to trash this movie and not give it a chance. Not sure what these people are expecting.The TV show was probably the worst, but because it's TV, people force themselves to like it, for some weird reason. Reminds me of Westworld, but I'll save my thoughts on that for another review.Sadly, because of the way this movie was received by the hardcore Terminator fans, and the way others were received, they cannot finish this series and move on, which is just a shame. James Cameron approved of this movie, and all the fans could say was, ""he was paid off!"" I'm sorry, I've seen Cameron's other movies; he's a hack when it comes to storytelling, but because he excels at special effects, everyone overlooks that. I think a part of the problem with the Alien and Terminator sequels is that everyone tries to judge them based on Cameron's movies, but the fact is, he can't tell a story, so when viewers watch a movie like Genisys that has an involved, deep plot, they turn against it. It's a shame."

However the story writers decided to seriously complicate the plot from a ""Back to the Future"" understanding of time travel and fast forward it all the way to a ""Primer"" levels of time travel. The end result is an incomprehensible mess of a story.If the plot is just so utterly jumbled - that even IF I were to sit down and motivated to even try to understand it - it really doesn't matter. The end result is a story we don't understand. A story we don't care about. A story about people we don't understand and couldn't care less about - because we have no idea who what or why anything is even happening. It's as if the movie wants to say ""Things are going to blow up! Just accept it!"".Terminator Genisys is a pure example about how movies can ultimately say nothing about the human condition and for all the special effects effectively mean zilch - and be all the worse for it. There was some subtle theme about being too trusting of technology with all our connected devices in there but it was so limp-wristed, so pathetically tacked on, and half-hearted that it deserves to be ignored.But by golly, by jingo, by jimminy willers, there were a lot of explosions!"

" Time Travel Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry
",-0.0772,0.0938,2018-04-09 00:00:00,5,"What you have here is a sequel and partial series reboot mashed into one movie. How else do you inject fresh interest into a franchise that's covered every possible angle of it's basic storyline going back to 1984? The only thing to do is recast some key roles- here it's Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese played by Emilia Clark and Jai Courtney, respectively- and then you tell the audience that some previously unknown actions by Skynet have changed the past. This allows you to go back and replay part of the original story with a different outcome. In order to do that trick, you do have to make logic stand on its head. (and yes, we all understand that you throw logic out the window in a time travel sci fi flick). Probably the worst diversion off the Terminator track was using this alternative past time line to turn John Connor into the main villain as a part man/part robot working for Skynet. This is actually pretty jarring to people who understood the symbolism of the earlier movies. John Connor has always represented JC himself. And the Terminator- definitely a kind of a prophet or an angel, existing in a place between God and man. (And not all angels are good guys). If you're not familiar with this allegory in this series, then consider the one line that's uttered in every one of these movies: ""Come with me if you want to live.""A lot of people probably also won't like the new Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. Their interplay in this comes off like two post millennial wiseacres- nothing like the characters sounded like in 1984. All of this just adds up to a confusing mess punctuated with the same type of super-action we've seen in every one of these movies. But, as we know, time travel means you never have to say you're sorry for the plot disruptions in something like this. It shows Hollywood's creative engine grinding to a halt. At least Arnold's in this one."

Although it was great to see Arnold in his legendary role, I think the movie took itself too seriously with those twists, and overcomplicated storytelling.

" Cash cow sequel, plenty of action but that's it
",0.0,0.9706,2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"The first two Terminator movies rank among my favourite films of all time, period. Disappointed with the third. Salvation was Ok. But this one? A few of my friends told me that it was very good but I am the sort of person that doesn't really take much notice of other opinions of a film until after I have seen it for myself.
I will not even attempt to write a short synopsis as quite frankly, story wise, I felt that this movie was pretty pointless. Yes, we have plenty of action - the scene on the Golden Gate Bridge being the standout for me - but the CGI, sorry I mean special effects, wasn't always great. Arnie is too old to be playing these roles. This film really is just a cash in on the franchise & although I acknowledge that at the end of the day it's all about the studio making money I, as a movie fan, don't enjoy seeing pale sequels to a great original. 
Don't think I'd want to sit through this again, despite all the action. I'll just stick to parts 1 & 2. Apparently plans for a Genisys 2 have been shelved. Thankfully."
" New ideas built in old movie
",0.0,0.9924,2018-02-09 00:00:00,7,"After seeing Terminator: Genisys I felt something like deja vu. Film makers came with new ideas, and created a whole new plot. Let's be honest, it's definitely not as good as previous movies, but the way the film proceeds to a viewer is strangely satisfying. The behavior of the guardian, excellently shown in Terminator 2 is enhanced with more embarrassing moments and genius Schwarzenegger smiles. Sometimes it feels like Arnold Schwarzenegger inspired himself during watching The Big Bang Theory. The similarity to acting like Sheldon Cooper is obvious, guaranteed by long senseless scientific monologues. As mentioned before, the Genisys takes inspiration from the former Terminator movies. Sarah Connor is however no longer frightened waitress but a brave warrior protected by 'grandpa'. Some may not like the way this film interrupts the previous movies, but I like the concept of making an alternate history with some gamechanging moments. However, there are some flaws thanks to which I don't rate the film better. Firstly, even it is individual, I don't like Emilia Clarke. Her acting so actually very poor in comparison to other actors, which is even more serious as she plays the main role. The role of a brave warrior does not fit her. Secondly, the film makers were so interested with the plot line that they created pilot so twisted and unexplained that some things seem irrelevant and impossible to understand. Where the hell did they take the guardian if the first Terminator was supposed to kill Sarah? And if the Judgment Day took place in 1997, how could the world in 2017 look normal? This playing with presence-past-future scenes is very unclear and I tried to understand the meaning of creators instead of enjoying the film. In conclusion the film takes lighter pace than its ancestors and is not as bad as it may seem. The biggest flaw of the movie is in making new ideas to involve, but in the end just scraping the barrel. 7/10"
" High Tech Load of Crap
",-0.3818,0.5853,2018-02-08 00:00:00,3,"This is by far the WORST film of the franchise. The casting is beyond horrible. They cast the worst John Connor, Kyle Reese, and Sarah Connor I have ever seen. The men were overwhelmingly in touch with their feminine side and do not come across as hardened soldiers that have been fighting a war for survival for most of their life. The joke of a Sarah Connor came across more like the girl next door versus a battle ready heat packing mama-jama she was attempting to portray. This is in complete contrast to how the original Sarah Connor played her role in Terminator 2. She was simply AWESOME!!!This is an extremely poor, all-over-the-place story line. Terminator 2 was the last great version of this series. This version was like watching a pinball bouncing randomly from beginning to end. The potential for a Terminator movie is huge. The flop of this version was as massive as the potential. Writers and directors of this movie simply suck. All they did was focus on special effects and explosions. Everything else was just thrown in as an after thought. The casting, story, and acting was unbelievably sub standard for such a major film. I think Hollywood thinks the next movie always has to have something the previous movies did not. Question: Anyone ever watch the show Law and Order? I have and can't get enough of it. Why? Because the characters have become real to me (in a fictitious tv way). I care what happens to them and watch not knowing what is going to impact their lives next.You don't have to keep trying to one-up the previous movie. You just have to make us care about the characters. Once you do that, anything that happens to them, big or small, matters to me. If I don't care about aka connect with the characters, you can drop a nuclear bomb on their heads and I wouldn't bat an eye. Get back to the characters versus the shiny objects and you will be successful. It all starts with good casting for the roles and builds from there."

Remember all those epic lines from T1 and T2? Or even some cheesy lines from T3? Well, you'll forget this movie as soon as you watch it. It's an empty random action movie that manages so sink lower than T3.Soundtracks, I can't remember any of them. Casting is a joke. Emilia Clarke is... well she's gorgeous alright but should she play Sarah Connor? Probably not. She's even a bit annoying.
Jason Clarke as John Connor what the... no, just no.
Surprisingly, the korean actor Byung-hun Lee is probably the best thing this movie has. He does feel a bit scary, he does recreate that feel we got from the T1000 in T2. But that's just my opinion. This is clearly just a franchise money milking. Don't watch it, or watch it and give it a 1 star review."
" Fun and fast - better than the last two films in the series

The film starts in 2029 (i.e. after the events of 'Terminator: Salvation') and John Connor is now played by Jason Clarke, with Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese - technically his dad, since he's the guy in the first film that gets Sarah Connor (now Emilia Clarke) knocked up. It may take a little while to get your head around it, but the filmmakers are assuming you know some of the backstory!Basically, John & Kyle win the post-""Judgement Day"" war against the Terminators/SkyNet - which makes for an exciting opening 20min! - but not before a T-800 (Arnie) is sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah. This takes us full circle and we end up right where the first film starts! Pretty cool, but something's change in the timeline and old Arnie is (somehow) there to stop just-arrived Arnie. From there, it slowly starts to make sense and fit together - in a parallel-universes kind-of way - but it doesn't really detract from the story too much. The plot is pretty simple and the same as all the films - stop SkyNet, which involves lots of being chased, shooting, explosions and one-liners!JK Simmons is funny as a 'believer' and gets a few good scenes, but Arnie gets some great lines and moments, especially with his ""smiles""! But the main stars are Clarke & Courtney, who work well together and are both better than the actors that played them in the previous films. There's a little bit of seriousness at the end, but action/fun/set-pieces galore throughout - on the Golden Gate Bridge, in helicopters, in trucks... always moving and fighting!"

When someone tries to make something great for two completely different groups, they are asking for trouble as they want to achieve the impossible! Adding insult to injury they have also decided to constantly repeat the lines that made this movie popular even if they don't make sense in the context, and use CGI tricks that define logic to the core. After watching it, and as a fan of the Terminator, I don't think I've wasted my time but I know this could have been done way better than it was.I'm sure that even Schwarzenegger wasn't happy with the end result, as during the movie his acting was too weird, almost feeling like he went with the 'don't care' flow and just gave up. The 'Mother of Dragons' Emilia Clarke impersonated today's woman of I can do everything and be a bad ass of a Mother but again the end result is just weird as a sequence to the 80's and 90's movie of ""we have to protect her"" (and the whole human race!). This should have been called 'Mum and Pop against the machine' or something else rather than Terminator.

I mean this was so bad to swallow that I had to watch 30 min. one day and the next day other 30 min. and so on.As a Terminator fan I felt totally insulted. Too bad the mockery seed was planted right at the moment James Cameron felt the need to add comic relief to his T2 and made a terminator force a smile. Then T3 and T4 came up to keep milking the cow and adding more and more nonsense with different directors, different cast and different BS like ""Judgement Day is inevitable."" or John Connor receiving a transplant from a cyborg or a mute kid trying to be Newt from Aliens. However, T3 and T4 tried somehow to keep the first movies untouched and followed a line of continuity. This time they did destroy what was left from T1 and T2. When I was watching Genesys I was thinking ""Damn, they got to the point of no return."" There is no way they could fix all the mess they did here. It's like when you see a celebrity that went through several plastic surgeries only to end up being a monster and not a person anymore.I feel sad. This movie is not only unnecessary but also extremely confusing and BOOORING. The actors were incredibly miscast, ALL of them. The characters that were loved by us are now annoying as hell, you almost hate them! They have no soul, there is no chemistry! Instead there are jokes everywhere, Sarah takes a terminator as a ""daddy"" (Gee, John having uncle Bob was enough!), they keep aiming weapons and shooting at terminators while they perfectly know guns don't stop them... They also shoot at holograms. Isn't that stupid enough? And John Connor is a terminator now? Give me a break! How can you do that to a character who is supposed to be the savior of the world???They not only copied or resembled the good stuff from T1 and T2 in a bad way, they even had the guts to copy ideas from The Sarah Connor Chronicles! Which was actually a good series. The bubble scene in the highway was clearly taken from there.Believe me... the only good thing in this movie was in the closing credits when the melody of The Terminator Theme came back to life, after T3 and T4 totally overlooked it using only the stupid drums as a motto. I wonder if those people knew that The Terminator Theme has actually a melody, not only drums.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, not only because it has a terrible cast, bad writing, bad actors, bad CGI, bad action, no plot, but especially because it did everything it could to destroy a legend.

And even without this, the effects and action are a match for Salvation without the cringeworthy ""Look, I'm a real boy!"" moments, so is several points up from T4 for a start.However, despite my general liking for the movie (it felt much more a part of the Terminator series than the previous two), it did have one plot hole so big you could sail the Titanic through it - bearing in mind Skynet/T5000 won at the beginning of the film (and must have know it was going to win beforehand) why the hell did it send a Terminator back in time, thus jeopardizing it's own chances of success? It was on a win-win whatever happened - Connor dies in the past=no resistance, Connor lives=take him over, and have some fun with the remains of the resistance."
" The Best thing about Terminator Genisys is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is Back. The most amazing terminator which makes the movie more fun and entertaining.
",0.9437,0.9987,2017-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Terminator Genisys: Movie Review.The performance of Arnold and Emilia Clarke is enjoyable. They have given a fantastic performances. The most entertaining thing in the movie are the funny one liners and punch lines delivered by Arnold's Terminator Character. Some Science Fiction elements, time travel elements and explaining some unexplained scenes is done brilliantly. Action Sequences, CGI Visuals looks good especially the bus chase scene sequence on the bridge is done beautifully. The Action Visuals looks great. The story line and time line plot of Terminator Genisys is set in both past and future. The direction of Alan Taylor is good but could have been much more better. The main issue and flaw of the film is that it lacks the best elements of first and second terminator movies. The timeline plot sometimes is too much confusing for some audience and the story plot line seems to be off the course. The script at certain points seems underwhelming and too much overloaded with unnecessary elements. Some characters are totally underdeveloped especially the negative characters. Some action scenes and CGI looks unrealistic and overdone.But, All over Terminator Genisys is good movie and a satisfying entry to Terminator Movie Series. The movie is definitely much better than Terminator 3 and 4 (Terminator 3 and Terminator: Salvation). Arnold is no doubt the best part of the Terminator Genisys.For Arnold, (He is Old, but not obsolete), and He is Back. (Once again, one of the entertaining performances by Arnold).In My Opinion (My Opinion Only) : I like Terminator Genisys better than Terminator 3 Rise of Machines and Terminator 4 Salvation. in my opinion I think Terminator Genisys is much more better than 3 and 4 and is a good reference sequel to 1st and 2nd Terminator Movie. I will rank Terminator Genisys 3rd best after 1st and 2nd Terminator Movies.James Cameron's Terminator and Terminator T2 Judgement Day will always going to be the best and one of my most favorite movies of all time. But, Terminator Genisys will also be in my list of good movies.The Terminator: The Best. (Ranking 2). T2 Judgement Day: Better Than The Best. (Ranking 1). Terminator Genisys: Better. (Ranking 3). Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 (Rise of Machines and Salvation): Yeah, just OK.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

I'm a big Terminator fan and loved the original Terminator back in 1985.. and of course loved the most successful of the lot Terminator 2 Judgment Day. A lot of reviewers on IMDb seem to be comparing this film with T2 as though James Cameroon made a master-piece of cinematography, Lets get real it was a great action film, and maybe a cult classic, but never had the best story line ( plot-holes aplenty ) or acting (Arnie is not Laurence Oliver).Having said that, this movie is a great addition to the series and reviewers giving this film 1 or 2 stars are the same as the movie snobs giving the original terrible reviews back in the 80's.. Most newspaper reviews slated the original dismissing it as a silly Science fiction movie.Now fans are falling into the same trap, yes T3 was terrible but Terminator Genisys really is worthy of your viewing time.. just don't expect Shakespeare."

Arnold was great as the ""guardian"" character to a young Sarah Connor.This may contain some spoilers.This story is set in some type of alternate time-line where time is sort of screwed up. What I mean by that It's the time-line we know just little different. Now lets get to the fun stuff, I own this on DVD when I seen this back in July,2015 with my friend,I can honestly say that I enjoy this film more than T3 and Salvation combined. To me this one was just more fun, now I don't hate the others with the exception of The Sarah Connor Chronicles that show at lest in season one was pretty good but I felt the writers on that show was starting to play with fire in season two,because I think they didn't have enough ideas and it showed but more on that with another review.This film I personally enjoyed through and through the action scenes were very well done with cool twist and turns and a pretty cool ending.Now I know some of you didn't like this because of the PG-13 rating but this film focuses more on the fun factor then the dark tone or blood and guts. It's more action packed driven.Overall I liked it and if your a Terminator fan I highly recommend it."

Light spoilers but it really won't matterI was hoping the movie would really build up the pre-story way before T1 happened but it was more about zipping between 1984, 1997 and future years. And in the process they pretty much made the T1 & T2 story lines irrelevant! Boooo. They should at least built them up and made them matter more. The movie also just rehashed T1 & T2 memorable effects and scenes. The liquid metal terminator is back, only Asian and uses the same techniques and the first guy. They should have made to him do new and cools things. They did a bad CGI of Arnold from T1 and they remade some scenes for retro gags but was not as cool when Marty doubled back on himself making out with his 'mom' in the car scene. The time travel tried to be like Inception but was kind of confusing and they used too many unfair plot twists; I almost dozed off near the end. Overall, it was mindless summer action fluff that didn't help the Terminator series at all."

" Not even mildly entertaining
",-0.3412,0.9931,2017-08-03 00:00:00,1,"A major problem for the film is that it doesn't even know what it is or why it exists. Movies normally come from somebody's need to be creative and get something across to an audience. This film seems to exist simply because somebody thought more money could be made from Terminator. But even so, one can't help but wonder why it was so convoluted. Clearly somebody invested a fair amount of time constructing this complicated plot. The question is: why didn't that person invest more time in constructing a plot that would at least be fairly entertaining?From the very beginning the audience is tortured by the convoluted plot on the one hand, and the confusing tone on the other. Is this a genuine Terminator film that treats the universe of the film seriously, respecting the serious tone of the earlier films? Is it a tongue- in cheek metafilm that focuses on playing upon the well known tropes and lines of dialogue from earlier film? Or is it something in-between? Do the filmmakers know what they are doing, or are they just swimming through this bog of nonsense, hoping to eventually get to the end and get it over with?I certainly felt that the people who wrote and the people who made the film had no clue what they wanted. The tone seems somewhat serious at times, but then lapses into bizarre attempts at comedy, which are totally out of place. As for the action, it seems unpersuasive, the CGI is more than obvious, and nothing ever seems to be at stake. It's more like an exercise in telling people what Terminator fights used to look like back in the day when a talented filmmaker wrote and directed them. However, except from outward similarities, the action scenes have no emotional punch and one gets the impression the director is not really trying. I guess what they were going for was nostalgia, hoping to put familiar characters in similar situations, and then every once in a while draw some humour from the irony of seeing them do the exact same thing yet again, sometimes with a twist. Indeed, the whole drama and the sacrifice that were at the heart of the previous films is now gone. The end of the world is just there as the backdrop and no one really cares. Kyle Reese is clean, shaven, well dressed, and sounds like someone who never saw a day of war in his life. Sarah looks like a character that would better fit in a Ninja Turtles film, and poor old Arnie is here exclusively for the laughs - which often do not materialise. The bottom line is that the film is neither smart nor well made as an attempt at irony. And even if it were, it would still lack the emotional core that all films need. You have to care and you have to be involved with the characters, if the film is to be a success.One star."

That whole movie is like an ice-cold beer in a can that you down all in one shot... and it's still the same closed, cold, pressurized can even after that that magically ""refreshes"" and re-seals itself. And what happens here? Nothing new, except perhaps a heavy bet on partial slapstick comedy ""filler"" on in-between scenes where Arnold's age (as an actor and human being) is made fun of with one-lines like ""old, not obsolete!"" Oh that's right, let's make a movie that is about the Terminator(s) supposedly, but in reality is about giving Arnold a ""retirement cheque"" role. Seriously?Perhaps movies and actors can be generally all jammed into one specific category that seems to be one of the mainstays of modern cinematography: re-hashes, re-boots and re-appearances of actors in roles that they for one reason or another (age most often than any other reason) do not really fit in, but go for it anyway for the big bucks.I had a girlfriend that possessed a wonderful and edgy sense of humor, she had a saying about older women who are past their prime: ""don't they understand that their time is over?"" This applies to a lot of things and/or people. A lot of actors... and directors... simply can't admit their time is way past. Hint, hint, Governator."

They were way funnier than a lot of jokes in so called funny movies today. It just seemed right to have him.First time I've seen Emilia Clarke not blonde. I didn't recognize her but I think she is way prettier than as Daenerys or for that matter than her IMDb profile picture. Is it ironic that she plays same character as Lena Headey did? She is a totally different look and it take a while to accept her as bad-ass here because she is so tiny and even kind of girl-next-door looking.There are some nice twists and it is totally not a remake of the first Terminator.

I honestly rather watch that crappy McG Christian Bale Salvation than watch this mess again. Terminator Series Ranking:Terminator 2 - Terminator 1 - Terminator 3 - Terminator Salvation - Terminator Genisys (SOOOOOOOOOOOO CRAP!)I went with low expectations, obviously nothing is going to top Terminator 1 & 2, but Genisys was just soooooo damn cheese balls and lame boring actions. There is nothing cool about the film at all. I watched the film in 3D and even that didn't impress me. This film should not exist at all. It's that bad. Just judging on action scenes alone, it is not even remotely entertaining. Most of us all hated Terminator 3 for taking that previous dark tone to making Arnold really corny with the ""talk to the hand"" cheesy image... yet Terminator Genisys has taken the cornniess and cheese balls and lame action sequences to a whole new level.It's shocking the plot, acting, action, special effects were superior in the first Terminator made in 1984, and Terminator 2 in 1991... made over 24-31 years ago!!!! YET everything in this 2015 film Genisys, the special effects and acting is a major major major step backwards. It's up there with Robocop 3 (what absolute trash). The acting is sooooo bad (Jason Clarke is always in crappy movies and acts the same way... he's not a good actor), pacing is awful, no tension, absolutely horrible story. This is the most superficial plastic typical Hollywood trashy product. James Cameron makes side characters like Dr. Silberman, Miles Dyson really shine and memorable characters with their excellent acting... yet the main characters/actors in Genisys acts like third-rate characters... It's so sad. Clearly they ran out of ideas and the actions are unimaginative, they tried to recycle and bring back some nostalgia but it doesn't live up to it at all -- it's just BOOOOORING. This FILM is SOOOO Boring! I can't tell you that enough. You've been warned. It's like they even recycled ideas from Resident Evil movie, making Skynet's ""image"" like the little girl from Umbrella Corporation... This is TERMINATOR. SOOOOOO LAME!This film actually makes Terminator 3 quite decent. At least Terminator 3 had some decent action and thrills.This film is just filled with boring same old same old action and even more ridiculous unexciting generic villain... these writers/creators can't think outside the box at all. They really screwed up the plot in a whole new confusing bad way. Everything was just soo bad. There is no heart, no humor, everything in this film is flat. It was so bad I feel like throwing up thinking about the film again. Avoid at all costs."
" Terminator: Revylation.
",0.0,-0.9888,2017-07-11 00:00:00,6,"If I had a time machine I'd go back and stop myself reading the bad reviews of Terminator: Genisys. The movie is an acceptable action romp largely let down by the quest for a young audience. This probably accounts for the lack of menace, although nothing can explain the tired reworking of set pieces reminiscent of scenes in films made over a decade ago.The plot sees Kyle Reese send back in time to protect Sarah Conner from a Terminator send back by Skynet to destroy her. So far, so familiar. But just as Reese his sent back, he witnesses John Conner (who you may recall is Reese son) being grabbed by an agent acting on Skynet's behalf. One result is a whole new future is created, one in which Skynet has disguised itself as a multi-platform 'killer app' . Science fiction fans will easily cope with such space-time shenanigans although perennial questions that dog such tropes remain. For example, if you knew the exact date a lethal computer programme would come on line would you choose to arrive years earlier or wait to the very last moment. I mean, nothing can go wrong with the latter plan can it...?The film's opening act provides the most fun for Terminator fans as Arnie gets to fight his younger self and the T-1000. Nostalgic violence ensues as scenes from the earlier movies are recreated and expanded. There's also an awesome recreation of Judgement Day. Science Fiction/Disaster movies set in San Francisco can be divided into two types: ones that destroy the Golden Gate Bridge at the start and ones that destroy the Golden Gate Bridge at the end. This film does both.The casting is a bit odd, particularly Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese. In the first Terminator movie, the role of Reese was cast to contrast with Schwarzenegger's physique. Michael Biehn was bugged out and wiry. Here, Courtney looks like a young Schwarzenegger. This has to be intentional and was maybe done to remind audiences of Schwarzenegger's youthful persona - now aged and grey haired and nicknamed 'pops' (credits list him as the Guardian not even as a terminator). Jason Clarke has what might politely be called a distinctive appearance and looks more comfortable as a business executive than leader of Earth's resistance against the machine. Matt Smith gives appropriately smarmy life to the anthropomorphised Genisys operating systemBack in the day, I think a lot of fans felt Terminator was 'their' discovery. I know I did. The film was a low budget affair. Director James Cameron was a relative unknown and, despite box-office success as Conan the Barbarian, Schwarzenegger had yet to cement his position as the mega-star he would become. It seems that the Cameron- Schwarzenegger pairing is what fans really want. Personally, I loved a lot of Terminator 3, but audiences rejected it as they've rejected this movie.Forbes on-line has listed negative reviews as a key reason for the film's box-office flop but I'd like to add lack of imagination to the mix. There's a stunt involving the characters trapped in a school bus that is only a slight reworking of a scene in Jurassic Park: The Lost World, except there a trailer is dangling off a cliff and menaced by dinosaurs which, as it turns out, audiences are much keener to see than homicidal cyborgs on the loose."

I love the first two films so much, thought part 3 was an abomination, and Salvation had some good bits, so I guess I was a little apprehensive about watching this one. I have never seen a film that so spectacularly manages to both simultaneously celebrate and p*ss all over the original 2 films' legacy. I thought it was absolute garbage and nearly turned it off up until the point when we revisit 1984, then started enjoying it for a bit, then the minute that we discover that what appears to be John Connor is actually a Terminator it all went to sh*t again. And to be dragged out for 2 hours! Please, don't make any more sequels. Apparently the rights return to James Cameron in 2019 and I guess he is the only person who can be trusted to make a decent sequel, although I understand he approved of this one and thought it should be considered the 3rd film in the series, so well never mind then.

Its plot is a really good twist of the old one. Yes, the story is not totally coherent. And yes, we still miss a few answers at the end. That's true. But the rest of the story is quite firm and all the action around it is well made. If only for Kyle Reese? Yes, Kyle here is different. This was probably a major offence: to change his personality so much. Another flaw in this movie is lack of sentiments. Too much action, too little emotional bonds. But again... Could all these emotions happen with this background? Could all these bonds form if everything starts as a mess, and confusion, and overall wrong? I, personally, do not think so. So it's all right.I take away 3 stars for Kyle Reese, plot holes and lack of sentiments. And I still have seven out of ten. No, really, this movie is underrated! Watching this you can nearly believe that ""Terminator 3"" has never happened and that ""Salvation"" is just a spin-off movie that doesn't really matter.I'll say that again: ""Terminator:Genisys"" could really make the whole ""Terminator"" franchise ascend from its pyre and be born anew.

And there seem to be so many plot holes. And development flaws. And stupid ideas. And I don't have a clue what in carnation happened in the poop that I sat through for 2 hours and 6 minutes as I counted down the seconds. The plot may actually be well-developed with explanations made apparent with multiple viewings for the seeming holes scattered throughout the movie; however, no one has the time, patience, or stamina to watch this horrid obscenity more than once. The story starting out relatively simple for a Terminator movie soon turns into scrambled eggs, except these eggs were made in a blender by one of the worst chefs in Hollywood. Alan Taylor should stick to television. The plot resembled that of Back to the Future: Part II (1989), where there were three Marty's running through the same/alternate time-lines, and all the other movies using time travel that got so mixed up the writer probably couldn't remember what was going on. But wait Arnie is here to save the day as an old Terminator (written back into the films with a bad explanation as to why he looks old), but does jack-diddly-squat to save the movie with his performance. To be honest, the Governator did elicit a few laughs with his strained robot smile. Yet the movie still seems to end up as a return strategy for an old fart and another way to milk the money bag for the production company, similar to Paul Newman in The Color of Money (1986). I feel bad for the talents such as Emilia Clarke and J.K. Simmons to waste their gifts on movies like this. Clarke should maybe stick to television with Taylor, and Simmons should just do Whiplash (2014) again. The believability factor for the piece on a scale from 1-100, 100 being real and 1 being Schwarzenegger's acting ability, is 0. The special effects look the same as in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and the stunts are as realistic as the special effects. The entire movie is an action movie with no substance, but it did seem like it almost tried to possibly add some notion of dramatic effect found in normal movies that actually happen to be good, such as a nuanced love story and questions of destiny. Unfortunately, they used time travel to do it."

Terminator 2: Judgment Day had a more complex plot, but still didn't strain my brain. Likewise, Terminator 3 wasn't that much of a challenge to keep track of. And the only puzzling thing about Terminator Salvation was how they made such a mediocre movie out of a once very entertaining franchise.Terminator Genisys, on the other hand, is so ridiculously convoluted that it proves virtually impossible to decipher. From the moment Kyle Reese lands in an alternate 1984 where he is attacked by a T-1000, I was completely lost, the story a blustering incoherent shambles that just gets more and more perplexing as it careens towards its inconclusive climax.As far as the cast go, Jai Courtney is bland beefcake, Emilia Clarke is very attractive but rather wooden, and Arnold is Arnold. No-one comes out of this looking great, the real stars of the show being the special effects laden set-pieces.The action scenes, of which there are plenty, might have made up somewhat for the labyrinthine plot, but they are so far-fetched that its impossible to connect with them. At one point, a school bus does a 360 degree flip through the air, landing with a massive crash, only to end up hanging off the edge of the Golden Gate Bridge; both driver and passenger survive. Similarly, a helicopter chase pushes credibility to the limits. I know that one must suspend disbelief with this kind of film, but Terminator Genisys asks way too much of its audience.After the disappointing Christian Bale entry, I really wanted to like this film, hoping it would get the series back on track, but I actually ended up liking it less than Salvation."

Sure for 2015 the sfx are good not awesome. there are some epic moments but they clearly do not save the movie. a few moments i enjoyed when Arnold jumped out of the helicopter. There are loopholes as well. how does Arnold know so much about machines from the future ?. I was trying to understand why they would change the future. Having watched flash TV series, yes an alternate time-line does seem interesting. well at least for 2015 they have wrapped up the story.Man 1 - Machine 0 in General cast - 5/10 story - 5/10 action/effects - 6/10 dialogue - 5/10"
" What's with all the duff reviews?
",0.0,0.9946,2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Occasionally - just occasionally - I depart from my usual bill of film fare and head for the bubblegum shop. So it was I decided to overindulge and watch the entire Terminator series of films in one horrendous and unhealthy blow-out.I well-enough enjoyed the offerings prior to Genisys, but felt things were flagging by the time I got here. When I read the reviews of Genisys, I was tempted to call it a day without watching it, but for once my completist obsession paid off.To my mind, Genisys is the best offering of the lot. Without any spoilers to give away a well-crafted plot it's difficult to praise the film to the level it deserves, but suffice to say I can understand why Cameron was one of the few who rated it highly for all the critical knockbacks. It's not only a worthy successor to his first Terminator offering, but also plays with its themes so beautifully that it's clearly a labour of love as much as of craft.The humour is dark, but gently amusing. An ageing Schwarzenegger - his age neatly built into the plot - is nicknamed 'Pops' by his charge, and throughout the film there's the sense that the film plays with what's preceded it while never degenerating into parody or homage. The action is played a little down from some of the excesses of earlier offerings - let's face it, it would be hard to play it up - but the action is there in abundance just the same along with the tension that comes with it. What it makes way for in being somewhat played down is a genuine humanisation of the characters. I actually gave a damn about the strange and complex relationships that came into play and, for the most part, the scripting allowed for them to develop well and realistically.Sure, I'm not your classic Terminator fan, but in writing this review I do so as someone who knows what anyone would have got out of what preceded Genisys. I got it myself. How on earth those who saw Genisys can't see it as a worthy successor is beyond me. To my mind it's spot-on.One recommendation. Do it my way. Watch the entire series in a sitting... or, at least, several sittings over a few days. If you can't be bothered doing that, at least watch the original Terminator once more before watching this one. That film fresh in your mind, you'll get a great deal more out of Genisys. But either way, don't write it off for carping reviews. Check it out, and decide for yourself."
" Not As Good As The Original But Better Than Expected.
",0.5855,0.9983,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Yet another Terminator time-travelling yarn. This time, because of previous alterations in the past, when this new timeline's John Connor sends Kyle Reese back to save his mother and himself from Skynet he is attacked by an unknown assailant. Kyle see's this and as he passes back through time he catches some strange images of his younger self.One of the reasons I loved this movie was the superb homage to the original by recreating some of the opening segments; this was a brave and daring move by the writers Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, and director Alan Taylor. This could have gone so wrong... but it was so right. Even more so, because the humour that appeared in T2 and was missing in the first as it was played more seriously, is here in these recreated scenes.When Reese lands in this timeline he finds that the Terminator he is following is not the only one on the hunt for Sarah Connor. From here on it's a race, not to shut down Skynet as that never come to fruition, but the Skynet AI, which has only been delayed and is now branded as Genisys. A total package app that will allow users to have control over all their gadgets... as will the AI. This AI will bring on a nuclear devastation as well as give birth to the Terminators.However, all of this leads to some paradoxes, one of which I really loved, though I couldn't really bring myself to believe it was actually an option. I don't like spoilers so I won't say anything else, though you'll spot it when it happens.The special effects are, as always, brilliant and larger than life. Taylor does a great job of keeping the pace going throughout the film, right from the tribute at the beginning to the reveal at the climax.Arnie Schwarzenegger is still the Terminator and it was great to see him back in the role, both real and CGI'd. He brings a nice joyful feel to the character, which is strange saying he's playing an android. This humour was added in T2 and worked really well, now he feels as though he's part of the family. A Terminator film isn't a Terminator film without Arnie. Now they have his CGI image he can keep appearing forever.However, though Emilia Clarke, did a nice job as Sarah Connor I still preferred Linda Hamilton's strong single-minded character in T2.I also wasn't too keen on this film's John Connor, played by Jason Clarke, or Kyle Reese, played by Jai Courtney. Maybe because the original film had such an impact when I first saw it. Michael Biehn was a much better Reese and I could believe the sexual chemistry between him and Sarah... that chemistry is lacking in this film - John Connor may never be born. Even John Connor's character isn't without flaws, he doesn't appear to be from Sarah's loins or even a ""super"" soldier created from her extensive training after his birth.These slight issues could be down to the writer, director, or actor. However, it doesn't stop the movie from being good fun... and giving plenty of scope for a sequel.If you enjoy The Terminator films then you will like this one. I would recommend you to give this a viewing, at least once. If you've not watched a single Terminator film then don't start here, go back to the original, you won't be disappointed."
" Not the best of the Terninator movies
",-0.5216,0.9204,2017-03-29 00:00:00,4,"I have to say this in the worse of the Terminator movies I have seen, I just don't really get why they had to change history. I loved the original movies 1 & 2, Terminator 3 was good and Terminator 4 was not bad to be fair, it would of been better carrying on from the 4th movie with the same cast. I don't think she was the best as Sarah Connor she looked to baby faced and not as tough looking as Linda Hamilton. And not keen on who they cast for Kyle Reece and John Connor, should Of kept the same actors from terminator 4. Very disappointed."
" A poor sequel...arnie go back to politics and stay there.

Unbelievable that the makers even thought this film could compete with the first three. I found no entertainment value in this sequel. How could Arnie even have the nerve to get out of bed to read the reviews of this movie. One wonders if this will kill off the franchise forever, as fans reflect on this, or even care about what might be. One of the worst films I saw in 2015."

The Leader of Resistance John Conor is shown not to have any Resistance to Skynet when it Integrates into him forcibly.The Hero is now Sarah Conor with The Guardian. In todays time AI's are being used in Army Operations and Surgeries in Medicine, they could have shown a Good AI becoming an Inner Conscience and Resistance to SKynet-The Bad AI! However they have fights between different Terminators and another thing why would Skynet create only one back up in John Conor and not itself go back re-gene-fuse with several others?Thanx"
" Exactly as bad as I thought it would be.
",-0.5423,0.9323,2017-02-18 00:00:00,1,"This is (very) easily the worst film in the franchise. The plot feels very minimal and forced, and does everything it can to undo all the progress of the previous four movies. The level of technology achieved by SkyNet in this movie is beyond the amount of suspension of disbelief I could have for any sci-fi movie, where John Connor is essentially converted into a cloud of micro-robots that can form into humanoid shapes and can only be dispersed/destroyed by extreme magnetism. And... somehow Arnold's terminator fights this by making a magnet glove out of a lamp post? How does that work?Putting that all aside, there's no visual continuity. Say what you want about Terminator 3, but the actor who played Connor in that film (Nick Stahl) does have a bit of resemblance to the original Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), and you believe he's Kyle's son. Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney look nothing alike. Speaking of Kyle, in the original Terminator he was lean, but muscular, and looked like a soldier but not too buff for someone who'd supposedly starved most of his life. Courtney, who plays Kyle in this film, looks like he hits the gym every morning and has glamour muscles. He also has none of the original scarring or any of the PTSD issues that Biehn's version had, and Michael Biehn is also a much better actor. I was not convinced that Courtney was Kyle Reese.And now for the worst part: like the title says, it was exactly as bad as I thought it would be. If it had been worse, it would have been enjoyably bad. If it had been better, well, that speaks for itself. But this was exactly as bad. There was a couple of funny lines here and there, and Arnold was alright in this movie, but the obvious CGI was shameful and I found myself angry that this movie was exactly what I thought it would be. The first three movies were all rated R and went all the way. This was PG-13, and clearly not fully realized. I'm glad I watched it online for free instead of paying for a movie ticket or buying the Blu-Ray."
" You're terminated
",0.0,-0.8019,2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"What was this? What was this movie? This movie was a big steaming pile of horse garbage. I was so confused by this movie. I have a lot to say1) The plot-HOLY CRAP!!! The plot of this movie makes NO sense! IT starts promisingly enough with Kyle Reese being sent back in time to 1984, and we actually see the time machine chamber, which is a nice touch, but having the older terminator destroy the 1984 version?! The only thing I liked about the plot was the twist of John Connor being the villain.2) The cameos-The only cameos in the movie were only 10 and 20 minutes each. And each one was a character from the first two Terminator films: The original t-800 from the first film, and the T-1000 from T2, but each was destroyed soon after showing up. SO POINTLESS3) The Characters-The only character I liked was the good old T-800 Arnold. He still has what it takes to be an emotionless machine. The others, weren't all that great. 4) This is the last thing, but what the heck did they do to Skynet? They turned it into an operating system accessible from smartphones, tablets, and computers, and it was called Genesys, not Skynet. And it wasn't even a military created system. How could this operating system cause Judgement Day? I just didn't really like this movie. This movie was all over the place. And it crapped on the original Terminator films. Terminator Genesys...you are TERMINATED!!!!"
" Disappointing at best
",0.25,-0.296,2017-02-11 00:00:00,4,"Terminator Genisys is an optimistic feat; an attempt to replicate what the original two films achieved. However, in its convoluted story-line, its white-washed and predictable villain, and its cliché story structure, it is difficult to enjoy without the tremor of disappointment. The few moments that provide the film with a glimmer of entertainment and excitement is when Emilia Clarke shows off her wild- side, and when Schwarzenegger pulls off the action-fuelled stunts. From a director who has little to show for his achievements, Terminator Genisys loses speed and momentum before half way and as a result, is a complete disappointment."
" An insult to James Cameron
",-0.5106,-0.986,2017-02-01 00:00:00,1,"I really wanted to like this (despite waiting for it to arrive on Netflix). But this was groan after groan. Opening with a completely cliché sequence which feels like the obligatory scene where we learn that Reese and John are buddies, in which Reese complains about all the killing he has to do... Killing? Does gunning down machines count as killing now? That is followed by a battle sequence that takes place over-top of a voice-over war speech John gives his troops ala Braveheart/every other war movie out there.I will admit that it is a cool concept to learn a little bit about the mechanics of how the time travel works, but it is a little lost when you are watching an entire battalion of soldiers staring awestruck at their naked companion.Once we bounce back to 1984 there is a lot of ""WTF""ery to get through as we see a crappy-looking CGI version of young Arnold re- enacting the original movie alongside actors who appear to have not seen the original - when suddenly, an aged Arnold arrives and picks a fight with himself.Meanwhile Reese is going through the motions of the original which are now suddenly interrupted by an Asian version of the T-1000, only to be rescued by that aged terminator alongside Sarah Connor.Breathe. Yes, by this point I was extremely confused as to what was happening. But Sarah tries to explain it, while addressing the aged Terminator as ""pops"" because clearly ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" taught the filmmakers nothing about pointing out how old our childhood heroes are getting. But before she can clear things up the T-1000 attacks and uses his liquid metal to revive the young Terminator - who for some reason attacks Reese instead of his actual target??What continually took me out of the movie was the fact that it is kind of a reboot, kind of a remake, kind of a sequel, so most of the cast made me question what I was watching - Emilia Clarke being the one exception; I actually bought her as Sarah.By a happy coincidence the heroes find themselves in a tunnel that has magical acid in the pipes... magical in that it melts the T1000's skeleton but not Arnold's.The next nice convenience is that with this altered time-line, Reese and Sarah can hop into the future - which just so happens to be our time, and Arnold can now look even closer to his actual age. Not contrived at all.With all of the confusion mounting up, the film seems to do it's best to either punch you in the face with action scenes or grind to a halt with boring scenes that explain nothing of the plot. Although we are constantly reminded that these two have to ""mate"", which on one hand was bold, but the fact that the actors have zero chemistry didn't help anything.So to add to the confusion, John makes an appearance in 2017 - apparently having travelled back from the future even though he was attacked when Reese left, and despite history being completely altered he still has scars on his face, but actually turns out to be a terminator in disguise, but not a normal terminator, a new kind that is also John at the same time. This mess is what I was busy trying to figure out while the movie wanted me to think about this Genysis thing which is like an IOS-artificial intelligence hybrid.So it turns out that the heroes have coincidentally landed exactly 24 hours before skynet becomes unstoppable, which of course makes one wonder why evil John helped them escape the police in the first place. But not to worry, rather than giving a sensible explanation we get treated to yet another fight scene.So while it is seemingly a Terminatorish thing to do, having the good guy suddenly now the bad guy, that goes down the drain when things happen like the following scene where we learn that John is attempting to make a time machine... the same type of time machine that Old Arnold managed to make-shift back in 1994 on his own. It seemed like they were also working on T-1000ish robots, which is kind of stupid seeing as the original model (Arnold) has not even been developed yet.At about this point in the film I was asking a zillion questions - like who turned John evil and why, and what their plan is? What is the good guys' agenda? and of course How much longer is this movie?But those questions were not be answered as it was more important to bore us. And now that Reese learns he is John's father we have the worst premise ever which is that two unlikeable characters know that they have to get together. On top of this, we have the situation that John now wants skynet to rule the world despite the fact that he (albeit in an alternate reality) is the leader of the resistance that fights them - making his motivations very bizarre.What follows is action scene after action scene, each one more boring than the last, until it crescendos in a monstrosity of ridiculousness, where somehow the time machine that the terminators were sent in now destroys them along with everything else in it's path - except Sarah and Reese of course.And the denouement is no better, with an upgraded Arnold reappearing, Sarah approaching young Reese to introduce him to his older self to tell himself something that is no longer relevant in this time-line. This movie is just.so.stupid. It's an insult to James Cameron."
" Completely forgettable
",0.0,0.9299,2017-01-27 00:00:00,3,"OK, so when this film was announced, people were hyped. Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor? Matt Smith playing a supporting role? Arnold coming back? This had a bunch of people excited. However, as they released more and more promotional trailers, the production team eventually just shot themselves in the foot. When you put your big spoiler/twist in your damn trailer, what reason to we have to come and see the film? Basically, this film tries to be a reboot, literally rewriting the timeline of the original Terminator films. Kyle Reese gets sent back in time to protect Sarah, like we've seen in the original film. However, John Connor gets infected by Skynet, now an all-powerful Terminator, played by Matt Smith. Meanwhile, Kyle arrives in 1984 about to be killed by a T-1000 dressed as a cop (sound familiar?) until suddenly Sarah Connor (now already hardened and confident) comes to save him.The timeline has been altered so that now Arnie was sent back in time to protect Sarah as a child so she is already used to the threat of Skynet. For some reason, they travel forward to the present day where this new app Genisys (simple spell check, guys) is about to launch, connecting all devices. We find out that Genisys is actually Skynet and Terminator John Connor tries to intercept our heroes and at this point, I just checked out.It's the same recycled plot at this point. The worst thing about this film is that it tries to rewrite the timeline of the two films in the series that people actually enjoyed. Every attempt to keep the inevitable Judgement Day at bay is pointless. There's only so much you can do without making this series completely convoluted, which sums up this movie entirely.What I want to know is how much did they pay James Cameron to praise the film in the promotional trailers? It only emphasizes what is wrong with Hollywood in the present day. Films are no longer made to be praised as a standalone project, they have to be part of an already existing franchise or cinematic universe.There's no point milking this cashcow anymore."

And that's why this movie is so upsetting.I'm going to come off as the old curmudgeon and I don't care. How can they do this? Why would they do this? Do you go adding lipstick to the Mona Lisa thinking that it will make her more modern and pretty? Do you go adding arms to the Venus De Milo? Terminator was finished, it was complete, it was a classic in no need of reforming or reparation.Terminator Genisys is an alternate time line for Sarah Connor, John Connor and the entire world. Of course, whenever they make a new terminator movie they have to bring an updated version of the killer machine. T100 in T2, T-X in T3, Salvation was a one off and then they come back with a nameless brand in Genisys that's better than all of its predecessors. Regardless of the newest death robot the point remains that they are trying to rewrite history and for what? More money? Immortality? What? And never mind the can of worms that has been opened. Whenever you start exploring alternate time lines you create endless possibilities and endless problems. Maybe that's what they want but it stinks to me.I want to try to look at this movie as an isolated entity but I can't. I cannot divorce my knowledge of the past in order to view this movie as a stand alone and judge it on its own merit. There is some cool CGI, some nice fight scenes and plenty of destruction but all action movies have that nowadays. This movie was supposed to be a link in the chain that's the Terminator franchise but instead it's a chink in the armor of a fading icon and a falling franchise."
