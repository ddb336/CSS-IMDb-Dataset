" Surprisingly fun
",0.6705,0.9042,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"If you're ynsure wether or not to watch this, I say give it a try.
We chose it because it was the effect mix for my family, some politically active and some maybe a bit too much on the right side of things.
Good fun blend of things.
I enjoyed it."
" A Humorous Look At War
",-0.3182,0.9005,2020-12-10 00:00:00,6,"A decent, but forgettable film that (much like this review) doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's humorous, but not funny (don't believe the trailers). Basically, it tries to give us a feel of what it is like to be a journalist in Afghanistan. It sure felt realistic, but having never been over there I can only guess at its authenticity. If you enjoy war films and Tina Fey, then you can't go wrong checking this film out."
" Not Bad At All
",0.431,-0.0005,2020-09-13 00:00:00,6,"Actually pretty good. Got boring a bit of the way through. It was a war related film, but there was quirkiness involved. Robbie is there, but not the best in it in terms of her character. I like the main actress.Nice, worth a watch perhaps6 stars"
" Sheer rubbish
",0.0,-0.4391,2020-08-08 00:00:00,1,"This film is just complete nonsense .Of course there is a bheast lover in the production of the movie ,that has to get football scarf of his favourite club into many of the scenes .So pathetic .
Totally irrelevant to the movie of course .
The film is all over the place ."
" bizarre movie, interesting to watch, satisfying end
",0.5267,0.9268,2020-06-14 00:00:00,7,"This was a bizarre movie to watch, its like it switches back between genres comedy-action-drama-romance.
Many boring moments, bad pacing, but kept me engaged to keep watching, the end was very good.
Good acting.
Took some time to figure out why the weird title, then I figured it, wtf.Worth watching, dont have expectations and you will enjoy it."
" Fey, Thornton, Molina and Robbie in good mode
",0.4404,0.9656,2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Good solid film carried by Fey and Thornton, Fey is actually more known for her funny roles here in the movie she knows how to convince in a serious role.
Margot Robbie, who plays a tough Dutch reporter, is of course also a feast for the eyes.
Also Mr.Molina as an Taliban Mayor was a very good choise for the Movie.
Conclusion: good cast and good storyboard for a good Saturday evening film"
" ""You do realize that this is not normal, right?""
",0.0,0.9202,2020-03-11 00:00:00,7,"This was pretty good, I enjoyed seeing Tina Fey take on in a more serious role, here she's a N.Y reporter, bored and frustrated with her life who decides to take a 3 month assignment as a foreign correspondent in Afghanistan. Very much out of her element 'Kim' is embedded with a marine unit and comes into her own.It was interesting watching Kim get addicted to the adrenalin and not living in the ""real world"" anymore and actually thriving in her new life. She ends up staying much longer than 3 months, becomes party pals with Margot Robbie, has a romance with drunken, womanizing, Scotsman Martin Freeman, and befriends Billy Bob Thornton, a fiery U.S general -his role is small but stood out, a great character. Worth a watch.Apparently this movie is based on the book ""The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" by real-life TV reporter Kim Barker."
" Memories...
",0.0,0.8876,2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Nice movie. It sort of gets the feel of the place right, as seen through the eyes of a westerner. Reminded me of the few months I've spent there, at about the same time. Been through corkscrew landings. Refused to go with some of my buddies to a 'chinese' brothel. Didn't feel sorry for that. My buddies did, mainly for wasting 100+$. Had a few drinks almost daily to cope with a place that at first didn't make much sense. Met some nice afghan people. Too bad for them the place didn't evolve for the better, as they, and I have hoped so. Surely the people I got to know there deserved better.
Worth your time."
" Very Good War Flick - Whiskey, Tango, Fandango (not a comedy)
",-0.2466,-0.9985,2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Let's get something straight right off the bat. This is not a comedy; and was, unfortunately, marketed in the wrong way. Lorne Michaels tries for another MASH, but winds up with a compelling human drama instead. This is a war movie; and a good one. The reason it failed at the box office falls squarely on the shoulders of Michaels, who should have known better. Black comedy should never look like it is intentional; it should be a naturally occurring event. The actors and director do a fine job, and the music is superb.
Wars should be waged only to win. If you lose, that is the luck of the draw. That is the basic philosophy of the greatest strategist of war in history, Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese general whose tactics are studied assiduously in every military academy in the world, including the Air Force Academy, Annapolis, and West Point.
The US military is divided into two sections; the Boots and the Boobs. The Boots are all the men below officer rank. The boobs are all the officers and politicians who call all the shots in so-called wars of containment. Wars of containment are for boobs, and they have killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of young Americans over the course of 70 years and three idiotic wars.
Since 1950, the Korean, Vietnam and Afghanistan wars have been in this category of containment. If there is any greater degree of military failure than these three wars, I would love to hear about them. The failure was not with the Boots; but from the boobs. Just look at the math. The percentage of boots killed and maimed is only about 100 times or more the percentage of boobs that are killed or maimed in these brilliant containment strategies.
WTF is the reverse acronym for the title of the film, and is obviously meant to be that acronym. And the title says it all for the last 70 years of military actions of the US in three major containment ""strategies"". The writer, director and actors do a great job of showing the most current containment strategy. As if we have learned anything from the Russians; like we had learned anything from the French before this, or the Chinese in the Korean conflict before that. Americans have about the worst sense of international history of any country in the world. We think in Western terms; in American terms. We never think in international terms or in terms of the countries we are intervening in.
The nature of war is very unusual. It is a place where you are the most alive you will ever be in your life, because you are surrounded by death. If you manage to stay unhurt and alive, you feel more alive than you do at home in your comfortable house and comfortable job. Ask any boot or boob, and they will tell you the same thing. This is why thousands of young US soldiers re-up for combat duty (in addition to needing the extra money). They are addicted to the juice; the action of being in action, the need for feeling they are more alive in a place where your chances of staying that way are way less than in your home country.
There is nothing glorious about being a boot or boob in a foreign country. You have several deprivations that average Americans take for granted. Showers, food, beds, sleep, shelter, relationships with the opposite sex, and other simple deprivations like going to the john when nature calls whenever you want. There are too many to even mention.
Yet these are all trumped by the need to be in the action; to be part of a close fraternity of brothers, who are much closer to you than your birth brothers. To be part of the tedium for 23 and a half hours, and then have the world explode around you for a mind-numbing 30 minutes or less. It is an addiction no less than the addiction of gamblers or drug addicts. WTF captures many of these realities of ""containment"" wars. It was refreshing to see a film that treats containment wars in the fashion that it deserves; with bewilderment, derision, and anger. The anger remains long after all the other events have passed. Anger by the boots and boobs over loss of friends, comrades and complete strangers for no good reason on earth. All else is meaningless."
" Surprisingly Good, Due To Tina Fey
",0.6249,0.9832,2019-09-06 00:00:00,9,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. This is due, primarily, to excellent casting. And this would not be the easiest film to cast for.Tina Fey plays the protagonist, Kim Baker, who leaves an uninspired life working at a desk writing news copy for a chance at being an on-air war correspondent in Afghanistan. Embedded with an American military contingent, she encounters a world that is foreign (to her), rude, dirty, shocking, insular, chaotic, and dangerous. But she has spunk. And chutzpah. Enough to carry her through some bad situations, only to thrive despite the mayhem of war.My only criticism is that the film could have used more backstory on Baker. Tina Fey's natural affability succeeds despite this deficit, but knowing more about her character would have allowed the audience to better understand her motivations for accepting the assignment, and to better identify with her.Despite this, the film is a success, delivering moments of levity (though I would not call this a comedy), moments of suspense, and some very touching scenes. This is a very human film. It revolves around Kim Baker, not the war.The scenery is amazing, though it was shot in the States. It felt authentic throughout. And I really enjoyed the ending, which felt appropriate and satisfying."
" my notes
",0.0,0.0434,2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,Very forgettable and boring story-movie. there's nothing about it specifically to rip on. just not my kind of movie. a few funny parts but mostly not. (1 viewing)
" A unique story that's not quite as funny as the trailers.
",-0.3843,-0.3708,2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"While the trailers make this film seem funnier than it actually is, there are some amusing moments. What really strikes me about this piece was that it was a unique story. Sure, there have been plenty of films about war and almost as many about journalism, but I can't really think of any films (other than this one) that cover both, let alone from a woman's perspective in a Muslim country."
" Truly excellent
",0.765,0.9694,2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,Glad I saw this one. Great everything and such a well balanced film. One of Martin Freeman's best performances and Tina Fey is just lovely. Strong story sensitively and amusingly scripted and performed.Already enough reviews on here so just wanted to put my two penn'orth in.
" Tina Fey's Homage to the US Marines
",0.0,0.8927,2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,Funny and serious. An excellent movie showing many of the human stories behind our TV news. I found the end particularly affecting. Brilliant job Tina!
" Kinda like Eat, Pray, Love in a war zone.

" Young Film Makers Take Note:
",0.0,0.4435,2018-09-29 00:00:00,9,"This is an aspirational piece. THIS is the kind of movie, whatever genre you are aiming for, which should be studied. Forget about knock out performances by Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Alfred Molina, Martin Freeman and Billy-Bob (who is rapidly approaching single name status and could never be played by anyone except himself!)- forget about the individuals and look at how the film translated galvanising emotional topics into daily existence.For instance: The goodbye at Kabul International Airport. As the car pulls up I could still here the course German laughter from two hours and three years earlier, ""Killed in action- ha ha ha..."" juxtaposed Kim saying to Fahim ""In my culture we would hug now."" You know though, as well as they both do, that if they do hug it will cost him his life. The dialogue right there, the silent words that passed between them until the proxy handle dropped, and they didn't speak goodbye. If every movie you make holds itself up to those lofty standards then you will be a force to be admired in the industry. Because after the roman numerals slide of the screen those are the moments quality viewers will remember; those points of humanity reaching out from the screen and sitting like a bloated whale on the beach.After all: there are no endings. I will get up and walk away from my keyboard into the next moment of my story, it will go on with or without the answers. So too did Kim Barker and the Afghanistan war... BUT this movie closed with satisfaction. There are no resolutions. ""Embrace the suck and just get on with it."" or one of the other most well used military style acromyms: S.N.A.F.U. (Situation normal: all f*cked up!) and if you really didn't get the title of this film then WTF?"
" It's so pretty I don't even want to vote.
",0.5058,0.9831,2018-09-19 00:00:00,7,Tina Fey takes a chance at doing both comedy and drama as a television journalist who aspires to be taken seriously so she goes to Afghanistan. It was shot mostly in New Mexico. Tina Fey can do comedy and drama equally well. The film has some storyline issues at times but the film comes across well as a whole. Billy Bob Thornton was great in his role. The supporting cast is stellar with Cherry Jones and Margot Robbie as Kim's friend and rival in journalism. Tina Fey was terrific and it's dedicated to Donald Fey too.
" Satirical comedy?
",0.3612,-0.9752,2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,"Doing a supposed satirical comedy about a conflict that last for almost 2 decades and has cot numerous losses of humans lives is a challenge. This one has also failed. Remember the amputee soldier? Not funny. Make sex at any cost? Gross. Talk dirty is not funny is cheap joke. This movie miss the point of trying to show a conflict in a country ravaged by extremists, terror attacks, cronic corruption, inhospitable land in a funny way."
" War comedy
",-0.34,0.8268,2018-07-14 00:00:00,7,Humourously written story of the girl journalist covering the war in Afghanistan. Some funny events are probably true. Some dialogs are clearly joking. Serious fun!
" I loved this movie. It is Underrated.
",0.5994,-0.6273,2018-03-27 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite Tina Fey movies since it shows her acting range and isn't just a comedy. It is more of a drama than a comedy since it is about War Journalism, and is both ""light"" and ""heavy"" at the same time. I have watched it a few times and look forward to watching it again fairly soon."
" Undersold an underrated.

" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9945,2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I stopped watching Saturday Night Live long before Tina Fey joined the cast, so I was almost completely unfamiliar with her when I read her book Bossypants a couple of months ago. That book made me a fan of her great intelligence and humor. This movie added to my appreciation, to the point where I can say, in a non-obsessive fandom sort of way, I love Tina Fey. This film blew me away. Her presentation of her character's personal and professional evolution was outstanding. I also was very impressed by Billy Bob Thornton and good old Alfred Molina--one of our best character actors, whom I did not recognize until almost the end of the film--as well as Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.The movie was so realistic that I thought they'd actually filmed in Asia. I was amazed that most of it was filmed in New Mexico. To borrow the vernacular of the script, this is a great movie, or maybe a fucking great movie. I loved it."
" Tina Fey, really?
",0.0,0.9667,2018-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I thought Whiskey Tango Foxtrot was an okay movie. Not great, but okay. It did not have enough action or suspense to be held up by those pillars. It had some R-rated romance, but not so steamy that the movie could fly with just the romantic involvement of the two leads. It had some elements concerning the philosophy of life, but that was not what the movie was about. I've got it... the film was a little bit like being in a boat that wasn't big enough to have a party or even make love, moving too fast to fish out of, and not sea-worthy enough for a long trip. How's that for an analogy?But the biggest problem I had with it was Tina Fey as the female war correspondent. Give me some time and I could come up with 50 actresses that would have been better cast. I noticed that Tiny Fey was of the film's producers. I wonder if that helps explain things to me."
" Smart & Funny
",0.6808,0.942,2018-01-22 00:00:00,7,"As usual Tina Fey delivers yet another winner. This lady is just so talented. I nearly didn't view the movie though for as silly as it may sound I was put off by the title. Amazing what a good title and one sheet can do to attract viewers. That said, my husband and I found it not just entertaining but smart and simply a really good movie."
" More than good
",0.4902,0.5726,2017-11-29 00:00:00,9,"First of all sorry for my broken English. I have to say something about this movie. Spoiler ahead. As I said, the movie is more than good but what I want to bring to viewers attention is just one scene. Liberation of the Scotish photographer. I'd never, never NEVER!!! expect what I've seen. I almost lost my breath. It's probably one of the best military action ever recorded in any movie. I'm talking about video. What makes it absolutely unforgettable (for me) is audio behind it. From the moment when choppers door close with marines in it, there is no actual sound...but there is a song. And who put that song with what is going on the ground is pure genius. Never...never in a million years, I'd expect that combination."
" I can only do this for a special friend.
",0.7096,-0.7916,2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"The film is loosely based on a true story. Desk jockey Kim Baker (Tina Fey) volunteers to go to Afghanistan to cover the war with the Taliban. We see the initial cultural shock and then her quick adaptation and acceptance of the life style. She gets to the point where she becomes addicted to the rush from getting a dangerous story. While on assignment she loses a boyfriend and gains a boyfriend (Martin Freeman).I enjoyed the film for what it was, but not for the comedy they attempted to sell it as. They cut every funny clip from the film and showed them as previews. When those clips are watched in context, they lose their humor (plus I've seen them before.) This was not a strong role for Fey, although the content of the plot kept it alive. I have mixed thoughts about the use/misuse of Harry Nilsson. Is that the song they really wanted? Guide: Plenty of swearing. Brief sex scene. No nudity."
" A War Drama Worth Watching
",-0.4588,0.9202,2017-10-10 00:00:00,9,"When my mom, brother and I first sat down to watch this, we were honestly expecting a comedy littered with laughs and sharp wit. Then when we really got into it, there was nothing funny about this. I have no idea why this was labeled as a comedy when it really wasn't. It was probably because of Tina Fey that it was labeled like that...but it didn't matter to us. We enjoyed it every step of the way. Probably another thing that made it good was the fact that it was based off of a true story and Tina channeled the model for the movie perfectly.I had no idea that Ms. Fey was capable of drama until I watched this. I had previously seen her in ""Mean Girls"" and ""Sisters,"" both of which were comedies, of course. This, on the other hand, is much different. She is a reporter who goes over to Afghanistan to chronicle the horrors of war and gets involved with a number of interesting people along the way.The only person that I could have easily lived without in this movie was Margot Robbie. It made no sense to me to have her in there and Tina, for all intents and purposes, ignored her throughout the whole thing. (Probably because Margot's voice is equivalent to nails on a chalkboard.) If Margot was trying to steal Tina's thunder, Tina wasn't having it. She was the star, not Margot. It was just that simple.This film just proves time and time again that Tina can tackle comedy as well as drama. As I said before, my mom, brother and I all enjoyed this movie and were very pleased with what we saw, primarily because of the previews that we saw with other movies and on TV commercials. If you're expecting a fall-down funny movie with this, you will be mistaken. Take this as a drama that is not loaded with a lot of violence, just thematic elements seen with a time of war. You may like what you see."
" Surprisingly wonderful! Note - it's not a comedy
",0.6227,0.782,2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"I remember seeing trailers and commercials for WTF. Turns out, they did one of my pet peeves: billed a serious movie as a comedy. It's not.The movie follows the story of Tina Fey's character; the situations are real, the people seem real. Some reviewers thought it was satirical, or made a statement - I found it as realistic as anything I've seen on the news or anywhere else. It's just ... real, and because of this, it's really good. Tina Fey does a great job in a pretty serious role.Considering it? Give it a shot. Just don't expect SNL or 30 Rock."
" How did I miss this movie?
",-0.1531,0.9645,2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie was FAR better than I expected, Tina Fey, always good, was great, Martin Freeman was super watchable, Billy Bob Thornton looked better than I've seen him in years, and (can't believe I'm saying this) Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying reporters not as seekers of the truth, which they aren't, but as vain, self-absorbed, opportunists more than willing to put others in harm's way if it gets their station a ratings bump. On a side note, heckuva depiction of ME for what most of it is, people with no desire for modernity. They're backwards, and they like it. We should get out of there."
" Not at all what I imagined
",0.0,-0.9631,2017-08-02 00:00:00,1,"I have given this a rating of 1 in order to leave a review however even a score of one is unworthy for this poorly played out film. This film portrays journalism and armed forces as drug using, sex addicted simpletons. We found this highly offensive given the fact that we have lost family members to war and know that they never took drugs or went to war to take part in wild sex orgy's. It makes a complete mockery and disgrace of any of the armed forces worldwide. If you are looking for a factual true to life film about journalism in Afghanistan then I would highly recommend city of ghosts, if you are looking for a film that documents true events of soldiers giving their lives to protect their countries then give Hacksaw Ridge a watch you won't be disappointed. I would rate them both 10/10 for their true to life depictions of war from either side. If you are someone who has lost a family member to war I would not recommend watching this messed up attempt at showing the life of soldiers or journalists who are out there facing conflict in these war torn countries."
" Confusing Tone
",-0.2263,-0.9957,2017-07-22 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)Someone should have asked the question if this movie should be a comedy, a war film, a documentary, a drama or a romance as it excelled at none. This actually could have been a compelling stand-alone drama even with a 2nd tier romance thrown in if it had to. Tina Fey is usually very funny but the jokes in this were quite lame. Combine lame comedy with some brutally real war action and a stupid rom/com storyline simply didn't work. The plot is Fey's character is a local news reporter moderately thrust into becoming a battleground journalist in Afghanistan. Knowing nothing about war zones, she boldly jumps into the world, avoids some enemy fire, interviews dangerous leaders. Will she make it big nationally? Will she make it back at all? Will she find a lasting romance at home or abroad? This movie also has the WORST, in my opinion, music used during a battle scene. It just failed. It really took me out of the tense and dangerous scene; it ruined the scene for me."
" What the Foxtrot
",0.0,0.968,2017-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Working as a war correspondent in Afghanistan proves challenging for a female journalist in this Tina Fey film based on the actual experiences of reporter Kim Barker. With Fey headlining, the film was inevitably marketed as a comedy, but it is more of a grim drama about the difficulties of working in wartime conditions in foreign lands where customs are unfamiliar. Along these lines, Fey's performance is remarkably subdued without any of the trademark kooky comic antics of her television work, 'Sisters' or 'Mean Girls'. It is quite a human performance with her best moments coming from the scenes where she has to wear burka to walk the streets, with the camera positioned inside the gown to give close-ups of her nervous eyes. Of the supporting cast, Margot Robbie is strong as a rival journalist also working in the war zone, but her character is somewhat written off in the second half. Billy Bob Thornton is also solid but has far too few scenes to make any real impression with Martin Freeman as a romantic interest instead receiving an overload of screen time. At its best, 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' is a captivating look at how working in a war zone changes the way one lives, interacts and functions. More focus on the supporting players other than Freeman may have given the film more a satirical edge, but Freeman makes the most of his character."
" Majorly underrated film
",0.0,0.9952,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot has been on my watch list since I first saw the trailer, but for whatever reason, every time I had a chance to watch it, I didn't. Maybe I worried it'd be too cheesy. Tina Fey can be a mixed bag for me. So much talent, so much intelligence, but sometimes she's too over the top. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this film exceeded my expectations. It was nice to see Tina Fey in a more dramatic, subtle role, yet still with her trademark awkwardness. Martin Freeman was outside his usual realm of serious, thoughtful characters, taking a turn for a more carefree, rakish, charming photographer. Margot Robbie stole her scenes, as usual. Billy Bob Thornton was perfectly cast. The writing was nuanced, somehow managing to be about the war, yet also these reporters, yet also about friendship, and yet also about our heroine. Very surprised by how great this was. Will definitely watch again."
" Delta, Uniform, Delta.
",0.0,-0.9492,2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"Initially, the script is quite humorous, and though you're able to tell that there is some noticeable level of comedy in this film, you sense that, especially it being a bio, amidst all the laughs, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is going to drop a bomb so massive on its viewers, it could bore a hole as big as Dean's Blue, right in your chest.Sadly, as the movie progresses, the humor also diminishes, and even worse, the expectation and anticipation of something stirring and extraordinary happening, turns out to be a... dud. Not quite the ""boring"", I was hoping for.Why is this even a biography? Why is it a biography worth telling? Why, did we need to see America's resources used to save some Scottish dude, in a very none thrilling, exciting or memorable fashion? Why? Is there something I missed? Why, did we need to see a story, of some woman, who didn't want to be at a desk anymore, unnecessarily risk her life, and the lives of her peers? Why did we need to see her predictably failing relationship with the boyfriend who's constantly travelling, in fact fail? And Tanya and Ali's arcs, felt as if they were just, abandoned. OK fine, maybe not so much with Ali, but man, this film is just a WTF let down.I don't know, this movie feels pretty meaningless, unless the message is; ""Why-so-serious-son"". Lets depict war and ""terror"" in a, not so significant light perhaps?I give this film 5/10. When it starts, its funny and sets you up... Just to feel, set up, at the end of it all."
" Great blend of comedy and drama
",0.765,0.99,2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"2003. Kim Baker is a writer at a TV news network in New York. The network needs a reporter in Afghanistan and, as her career has stalled and her life is in a rut, she (apprehensively) takes the job. Nothing could have prepared her for life in Kabul and what she'll see and experience - she is truly a duck out of water. Over time, however, she adapts and even thrives. More than thrives, she seems to live for the danger and excitement, a fact that not only endangers her own life but that of her colleagues too.I didn't have great expectations before watching this. While Tina Fey's TV work is superb (30 Rock, SNL) her movies often miss the mark, ending up lightly entertaining, at best. So, was expecting a light comedy and nothing much in the way of drama.Turns out the movie is very funny, and, even better, often darkly so. The humour is often presented in dramatic or very plausible situations, so doesn't feel forced, feeling more like a candid view of people in a war zone. That's the beauty of the movie - it's as much a drama as a comedy, and the comedy stems from the drama, rather than existing in a vacuum.On the drama side, the situation in Afghanistan is very realistically portrayed, without shirking from the events and issues involved. While the press attempt to make the most of their situation and live it up, attempting to shut themselves off from their surrounds, the threat of violence and death is never far away. There is a fatalism hanging over the movie which makes it even the more engaging and compelling.Not perfect though. I felt that, while a good and often funny story, it didn't really make a profound point in the end. The conclusion seemed quite flat, especially after what came before.Overall: a great blend of comedy and drama."

",0.0,0.4059,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Margot Robbie being sexy, funny as hell and not playing fair at all. No I'm not talking about Suicide Squad, I am indeed talking about this movie. And don't get me twisted, Tina Fey knocks this one out of the ballpark as the saying goes, but Margot even though her screen time/presence is limited gives a powerful performance too. Dare I say even more lasting than ... But that's up to you to decide if you want to compare her acting roles or not.One thing is for sure, this being based on a book (actual events one can presume from that indeed), may feel stagnant at times and really low paced. But this strange reality based theme and the really grounded central performance by Fey give this the gravitas to make it a really good movie. One that will not be liked by many, but nevertheless a movie with quite some weight and a message"
" This comedy wasn't full of laughs, and it didn't tell much of a story either.
",-0.033,0.9462,2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"This comedy wasn't full of laughs, but it didn't tell much of a story either. It simply drifted. The soundtrack forces the movie to read as a romantic comedy, and is oddly pensive and optimistic at moments when people are being gunned down. Perhaps the film was actually meant to be a romantic comedy. Despite being about an independent female reporter in Afghanistan, the most interesting storyline is Kim's relationship with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). I did enjoy how as the movie progressed, the once scary and threatening Afghanistan had turned into ""home"" for Kim."
" A strong cast gets Fey through it
",0.5106,0.9972,2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"I'll admit to not being the biggest fan of Tina Fey. I find she often plays it too safe in her comedy and has never managed to step out there and take on that role that could be a game changer. So I was interested to see what she would produce in 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot'. The movie was certainly a lot more serious than a lot of the promotions would have you believe, and so we got to see Fey doing some real acting. I wouldn't say she was brilliant in the lead role, but luckily the script and supporting cast were enough to carry her.There are certainly a lot of familiar faces in the cast. Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton and even an Australian actor who I know from a show called 'Home & Away' called Stephen Peacocke plays a minor role. So for a film set a long way away in Afghanistan, I certainly never felt lonely about the accompany of actors and actresses.The film is more a series of events than an overall arcing plot. There is a story in the background, but it works more as a collection of tales (this is based on a true story). I found a lot of the events portrayed very interesting to watch. It's safe to say the film is at its best when it is trying to entertain you, rather than when it is trying to impress you (if that makes sense). Basically I mean when the film tries to have a heart and show off Fey's acting skills it can fall apart a little. The rest though makes for great viewing and I'd happily recommend this to most people."
" Totally Unexpedted
",0.0,0.9862,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I did not read any other reviews nor did I read the synopsis of this movie before watching it. I had seen a few trailers out of the corner of my eye and thought; Tina Fey, has to be a totally laugh out loud comedy, right? I could not have been more wrong. This was a Dramedy in every sense of the word, but more drama than comedy. Tina Fey was excellent in what I would consider her 1st dramatic role. She played the part brilliantly. Once it started and I realized it was not a total comedy, I was apprehensive. I continued watching and was glad I did. I completely enjoyed this movie and I think you will too."
" Sorry, I don't waste time or money with...
",0.2575,-0.7551,2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"...any movie with Tina Fey or her Liberal Constitution hating friends. I just don't watch movies which may make the Hateful-Intolerant-Abusive-Bullying Liberals any wealthier than they already are. Seriously, think about. Matt Damon is too stupid to make a movie without a gun in his hand but he dreams of a day when guns are confiscated--I dream of that day too so we can dispose of all the stupid Matt Damons in the world. Tina Fey is always swallowing Alec Baldwin who is always bullying, in a very hateful manner the President of the United States. It takes a person who really hates the United States to spend money on a Tina Fey anything."
" An above average dramady that focuses on war
",-0.5994,0.9989,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"This film has an impressive cast so i decided i would watch it but right off the bat this film is not a straight up comedy. It is a drama that has comedy elements filtered in it. The premise of this film sees a journalist sent out of her comfort zone to Afghanistan to cover the war going on over there. Tina Fey plays the lead in this film and we all know she is a great comedic actress and she brings allot of humour and likability to her character in this film. What I also really liked is the fact that she gives a great dramatic performance in this film that was very unexpected. Margot Robbie plays her journalist friend in Afghanistan and she gives a really good performance in this film and has really good chemistry with Fey and you do buy their friendship for the majority of the movie. Martin Freeman plays her photographer in this film and he does a really good job, it takes a minute to get used to his Scottish accent but I liked his character and found him fun to watch. Christopher Abbott plays her driver in Afghanistan and he does a great job building his friendship with Fey and making himself a fun interesting character in the film. Billy Bob Thornton and Alfred Molina have slightly smaller roles in the film but they give memorable fun performances. The story in this film is probably my least favourite thing in the film, there isn't anything very memorable about any of the narrative and everything moves along in a very cliché matter. The script has some very quick and witty dialogue that adds allot of realistic dialogue to these characters. However, I don't feel the dramatic dialogue was written very well to make it memorable. The style of the film has some fun scenes and it is interesting at first to see this reporter in Afghanistan clearly out of her comfort zone. However, the tone of this film is pretty inconsistent it goes from funny to dramatic to sometimes horrific and it doesn't handle it all that well. overall this is an above average film that if you like this cast may be worth a watch but it just isn't very memorable or unique at all."
" Tina And Margot's Bogus Journey
",0.0,-0.9929,2017-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Wanted to like, did not. 2/10.Portrays American journalists as ignorant, lacking respect for other cultures, reckless and oblivious to the dangers of a region in conflict. I'm skeptical a news agency would deploy a reporter with no briefing whatsoever and the USMC would allow embedded correspondents off leash in a firefight as depicted in the film.Somewhere in the middle of the film the comedy subsided, Billy Bob got promoted from Col to (B?)Gen and Fey learns expletives in the local language. Neither of the latter developments are on screen.The inclusion of a PG rated sex scene was unnecessary. If the film requires a sex scene show the sex, not weird foreplay followed by a jagged cut to the stereotypical lady full of regret morning after. Just skip it if the leads don't want to get naked.The alt-rock soundtrack didn't fit the subject matter particularly well. Also sick of 'Jump Around' in movies. Find a new song already.Minimal character development. Maybe 1.5 characters we actually care about, the rest are filler. Some guy died as a result of a drone strike. Another took shrapnel to the eye. I guess it was the other news crew thus nominal plot impact. The attack itself was poorly executed. Showing the ops guys lining up the target before the strike spoiled the moment. Sucked all the drama and horror out of it. Oh boy here it comes!!! Missile!!! BOOOM!!! Limbs everywhere. USA is dominate!A Nice Marine got his legs blown off by an IED. Heard about it from a competitive reporter (Robbie) laying a guilt trip on Fey. Again, no emotional investment. The film wraps up with Fey visiting The Nice Marine back in the US. No anger, no blame. Just a happy ex-Marine with his cute wife, child, modest home and no legs. Good job movie. Battleship (2012), for all its faults, at least portrayed the double amputee Army vet Mick Canales as angry with the world for the loss of his legs. Reality is somewhere in between most likely but I just don't see a Marine having an ""it's all good"" attitude so soon after his loss.The script took a couple of cheap shots against the USMC and US Army. Not a ra-ra military guy but I could see veterans being put off by the dialog. If the jokes had been funny it might have worked.The one dimensional representation of Afghanistan seems to the product of uninspired screen writing. It paints a bleak picture of the culture. No happiness, no kindness whatsoever. Perhaps it really is that way? It's not clear who or what the antagonist is. The conflict? The culture? The Americans? The boss back in NYC? Boredom? Weak story overall. No tension. No real drama. Just a reporter abroad with no clue who or what she is dealing with. It was implied boredom is a first world problem. Perhaps it is. Not sure the solution is to be useless in Afgahnistan.I will give the film points for not including a gratuitous rape scene. I expected it and was pleasantly surprised it didn't happen.The movie could have been interesting if it wasn't a trying to envelope the horrors of war in a chick flick with Superbad-eque tendencies.With work Fey could be a decent dramatic actor if she lets go of the need to inject SNLisms every line of dialog.As a satire Whiskey Tango Foxtrot pales in comparison to Starship Troopers. The film attempts to be serious and as a result its message and impact is lost.Interesting premise. Lousy script. Passable acting. Mediocre action. Rent once and forget."
" Tina Fey is the pinnacle of this smart, but sporadically muddled war satire
",-0.6471,0.6378,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"It takes an actress like Tina Fey to keep this biographical dark comedy moving on it's feet. This film directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa introduces Tiny Fey into the complex world of the controversial War on Terror that's been raging in the Middle East since 2001, and the dirty politics splashed in the faces of war correspondents who must stroll out there to get the news out the media. And the main figure in the story here is news reporter Kim Baker who's world is translated by director Ficarra and Requa from the pages of the real-life Kim Baker's memoir 'The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan'. Stretching a mixed bag of comedic R-rated dialogue and somber atmosphere surrounding the grim reality of war, this film boasts just enough laughs and substance that greatly more make up the occasionally muddling story that follows the lead figure's treacherous experience in wartime in Afghanistan. Based on true events beginning in 2003, this film follows Kim Baker (played by Tina Fey), a news correspondent who takes a three month job as an international news reporter in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. Sharing ties with fellow news reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (played by Margot Robbie) and freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie (played by Martin Freeman), Baker comes face-to-face with the ruthless reality of war in the Middle East that makes her job far more terrifying than he initially expected.In contrary to the trailer may lead you to believe, this film is not all laughs and fun. It dives into the dark territory in efforts to showcase the harshness news correspondents must deal with in order to deliver the news about international conflicts (soldiers are killed in some scenes), and it accomplishes this far more superior than many other films. In the process, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa on capturing the gritty turmoil that sweeps Afghanistan and the Islamic civilians off their feet. The biggest trouble that is left on the pot is the occasionally incoherent story that follows. While the plot is no ways groundbreaking, it would be more involving if writer Robert Carlock came up with a slightly more coherent script, particularly one that can potently balance the comedic tone along with the darker tone which the film sporadically struggles with. Luckily with Tina Fey operating the lead role, there is fairly enough laughs and cleverness to be handed in the midst of the military-based chaos. Fey delivers just enough substance, humor, and humanity the role as the shell-shocked news reporter who must witness the dirty atmosphere on what goes on not only in the War on Terror but the shady news business. Her comedic chemistry with the supporting cast Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton along with Christopher Abbott and Alfred Molina in the controversially white-washed roles works decently; even with the laughs are more than not hit-and-miss.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a fine comedic take on war satire that boasts the solid likeness of lead Tiny Fey, even if it struggles with a semi-coherent script. This biographical dark comedy may offer the exciting showcase on war satire (at least not the lines of more superior war comedies like 'Three Kings'), but that doesn't mean it fails to make for an appealing ride especially for those who've read Kim Baker's critically acclaimed memoir."
" I hated this movie. I absolutely hated it.
",-0.8555,-0.7739,2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Of all the war dramas that I have seen over the years, (Saving Private Ryan, Tora Tora Tora, Fury) this movie is by far the worst I have seen. Even the name makes me angry. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, or if you only read the capitalized letters, WTF. People were killed in the conflict in Afghanistan and this is the best they come up with!? Frankly it is insulting to both the military and to journalism in war zones. Granted Margot Robbie and Martin Freeman did some decent acting, I can't get over the fact that Tina Fey was chosen for the leading role. She is a known SNL crony who helps push their liberal agenda on an unsuspecting populace. She couldn't even try to take her role seriously, always acting like a clueless news reporter wannabe who wants to make a name for herself. And yet a full quarter of the movie was about a bunch of reporters from all over the globe getting together in Afghanistan spending their nights drinking, partying, and shagging each other. You know what, I take it back. This was a low point for both Robbie and Freeman. Her role in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and his ongoing role in the PBS ""Sherlock"" series did not deserve any of this being in this train wreck. The entire movie told me that journalists were a bunch of horny, boozing party animals who don't understand what is going on around them until a missile explodes in their face and one of their friends dies, but as long as their boss gives them a raise and a place on the evening news then I guess it's okay as long as nothing bad happens to them. Just don't watch this movie at all. It will be another name in a long, sad list of obscure Hollywood movie titles."
