" Propaganda - coming from a Turk
",-0.25,0.34,2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"I like Russell Crowe and the Turkish War of Independence means a lot to me - yet it was not the right way to show it. Greeks good Turks bad was the theme of this movie, which is far from the truth, and this is coming from a proud Turk himself."
" What a great Russell Crowe movie
",0.6249,0.9817,2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I have never seen Russell Crowe in a bad movie. But this one is one of his best, maybe it is his best. The story, the script, the action, the cinematography, the way it grabs you by the heart. Whoever picked Olga Kurylenko is definitely a genius. She is absolutely radiant, her acting is very good too. She must be the most beautiful actress of the 21st century.Really all of the acting is extraordinary. Too many names to mention. The subject matter is very important as this seems to be like a footnote in world history but it was a very significant battle followed by more and more killing. It shows just how senseless war can be. It also has a lot to ponder in the actions people will do out of love for their family."
" Something Excellent To Crow (pun intended) About
",0.5719,0.931,2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Extract from 'The story behind The Water Diviner'.
While conducting research on events at Gallipoli, archaeologist, writer and University of Melbourne Arts alumnus, Andrew Anastasios, discovered a line in a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Hughes, a worker in the Imperial War Graves unit, who was recovering the dead after the war. The line in the letter, a footnote in a much more detailed account, simply said, ""One old chap managed to get here from Australia, looking for his son's grave.""
""Lt Col Hughes was trying to identify the bodies, and here was this father who just turned up from Australia, out of nowhere,"" recalls Andrew. ""It was a huge commitment and a serious undertaking to visit a country of which you have no knowledge.
""By that stage, the Ottoman Empire was being dismantled completely by the Allies, and so it was in disarray and the idea of just turning up in a country that is slowly being dismembered was really quite fascinating. I guess that line just jumped out at me.""
That is the basis for the film and everything in the movie was made up and embellished beyond the book; so there are no historical pieces to be nit picked about, as some have tried to do. There is a disgraceful background to this war and its pure animal carnage of massacre that occurred because of it but all that needs to be said of this as a film is that its a wonderful directorial debut by Mr Crowe (Russell). Yes there are lots of mistakes to it and a few cultural insults but, Mr Crowe is most definitely not known for.....well that's another tale :).It unwraps at a nice smooth pace that does not degenerate and things such as lighting and scenery are perfectly captured. Its just a simply really nice film to view."
" Entertaining and eye opening.
",0.4404,0.79,2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Great visuals and entertaining movie. However there are some things that are not fully explicit and that determine the way you appreciate the movie. The story behind the Turkish coffee for example which is important. The water diviner's connection to divining bones and also the final escape from the well... It's a bit too much. I didn't like that some turkish dialogues were approximate and uninteligible. Some subtitles translation were off. However, the story shows the real face of things at that era where the greeks where slaughtering local turks, which infuriated some reviewers here as I see."
" it was a successful movie but...
",0.5859,-0.3882,2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,Turkey has been portrayed as a middle eastern country in this movie but this is definitely not in real. This is really disturbing for us!
" Excellent. Moving story

Gripping and well acted. Russel Crowe directs for the first time to great credit. A story that transcends mere sovereignty You don't have to be Turkish or Australian Its anti war."

" The Best WW1 Film Ever
",0.6369,0.8519,2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Objective and realistic. The story brings you into WW1 years, and you can see the situation from all sides point of view. Acting was also amazing, Russell as you know. I liked the Turkish military officers too.If you are interested in history or WW1, must-see."
" Anti-War Movie from an Australian Perspective
",0.0,-0.9867,2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"In 1981 the film ""Gallipoli"" was released, and even then some reviewers complained of bias, but that film and this one are clearly anti-war films based on the tragic waste of lives that was the World War I battle of Gallipoli. Blessedly, this film concentrates not on battle but on the quest of one man to find his three sons after the war. His ""water diviner"" intuition tells him that one of them is still alive. A small portion of the film was made inside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, other scenes were shot in the city, but the majority was shot in Australia. The cinematography is impressive, Crowe's performance is believable, and the supporting cast is outstanding. To dismiss this film as historically distorted or biased is to miss the point. It is not history at all; it is a movie. To conclude that the film is worthless because it humanizes Turks is to justify the endless march to war that has been the history of the human existence and to ignore the fact that for warmongers today's enemies are tomorrow's allies."
" I'm disappointed, everything here is so familiar and full of clichés - the film just don't have the resonance it so desperately strives to find
",-0.7555,-0.9001,2020-07-27 00:00:00,6,"For me, directorial debut of Russell Crowe and his attempt to tell a tale of war, tragedy, loss, romance and healing was quite long, clichéd, uneven and unsatisfying movie experience. He also, as a main character, seems to be blessed with some mystical power. Really??? The use of flashback confuses the issue, leaving us scratching our heads as to whether we are sharing his psychic visions or it's simply a matter of clumsy editing. In general, movie is too unfocused, while the film has none of expected dramatic tension or emotional depth. Ukrainian-born Olga Kurylenko is miscasted here, and no matter she tries her best, it's difficult to accept her as valid character. Actually, whole this (an extraneous romance) aspect of the story is awkwardly introduced and never especially credible. Movie runtime is too long (111m). Also, no matter that the story develops complex characters such as Turkish Major Hasan, it also contains some unfortunate, to say stereotypes or today political correctness such as the Turks as noble and heroic, the British as pompous and arrogant, the Greeks as savages and marauding bandits (Satan's army, says one of the film's characters), Aussie soldiers as a raging blood thirsty killers, while the priest is being presented as quite 'unholy' man. With its tendency towards such ... oversimplification (who produced this movie I wonder), this 'water' may not taste right. Because of so many clichés, the movie barely emotionally touched me, while most of its runtime I was bored. Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"", starring a very young Mel Gibson, is much better option for an iconic image of Aussie WWI heroism, if ever there was one. At the end, Russell Crowe is much better actor than he is director. Disappointed so much, I even disliked the font used for the titles.Rating: 6-/5+ Just 'cos of nice scenography"
" This film would be better placed under the category of science-fiction
",0.4404,0.8365,2020-07-23 00:00:00,5,"So, we have an Australian superhero who, being a humble peasant and family man in his homeland travels to Turkey in the years after WWI in search for his disappeared sons, and once there he manages to: 1) get to the place of the Gallipoli battle and find the exact place where two of his sons were killed and lie under ground, all thanks to the seeming extrasensorial faculties he possesses, 2) again with some extrasensorial help (intuition will say some...) find his third son alive in a remote village, 3) allow the escape of a foe-turned-friend Turkish military official from a fully armed squad of Greek soldiers using a wicket to fight them, and 4) beat up a group of members of a Turkish family clan one of whose members had been previously insulted by our protagonist (this time he was barehanded and the ones using sticks were the rivals).Why the surviving son never returned home when he was not badly injured or affected in his mental faculties after the battle (and is now living a miserable life in a small remote village) is not coherently explained, being this the triggering point of a family tragedy that prompted the trip of the protagonist.Apart from all this... pretty photography in evocative sepia colors, a ravishing Olga Kurylenko playing a Turkish widow soon-to-marry as second wife a rich man (but making googly eyes to our hero now and then), and a playful smart boy intermingling occasionally in the story, may keep you mildly entertained if you do not take the story too seriously."
" Entertaining tale. It's not a documentary
",0.4404,0.8872,2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"While it does say it's based on actual events, I enjoyed the story as entertainment and will let others point out historical inaccuracies.It's a well-produced movie with good performances and direction, by Crowe. It moves along nicely with some gut-wrenching moments. I wasn't thrilled by some aspects of Crowe's character's ""abilities"", but just went with it.Overall, an entertaining story and worth watching."
" Better Than Average WW1 Tale - The Water Diviner
",0.4939,0.9719,2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"This film is not as good as some WW1 classics such as 1918, Gallipoli, or Paths of Glory, but it certainly places fourth on that short list. This is a very nice effort by Russell Crowe, with a lot of help from a talented supporting cast and a very interesting script. The one thing about this film I found interesting was the treatment of Turkey and the Turks in WW 1. No other Hollywood film has shown them in such a positive light. Lawrence of Arabia merely showed them in a stereotypical way (they were the BAD guys) and other films have depicted the Turks as just background for WW1 topical films. This is the first film that delves into WW from the Turkish standpoint. I did not buy the romantic aspect of the film, but that was a minor glitch. The primary story is overwhelming enough to overcome that small bump in the road."
" Awful amateur movie- ridiculous propaganda
",-0.7579,-0.8271,2020-05-11 00:00:00,2,"This is Russell Crowe's first attempt as a directors and probably his last.His directing is amateur to say the least. Cinematography on the other hand has some good moments and scores some points.The story is ""inspired by real events"" but it doesn't really seem believable in any way.
Russell Crow with his magic powers, manages to find his sons in a battlefield with 100.000 dead people. He goes to the field and says: ""you can dig here, i found them"".The historical accuracy is laughable.
At first he tries to convey a neutral message, but in the end the movie is totally one sided and inaccurate.The turkish people are portrayed as saints/victims and all the other like devils.
He somehow forgets to mention the genocide of 3.500.000 million christians from 1900-1923."
" Poor
",-0.4767,0.3291,2020-05-02 00:00:00,2,"When the story line refers to historical events in an inaccurately dramatised way then the audience of the movie, particularly the younger ones, see it as actual history. This movie unfortunately falls neatly in this category. The Gallipoli campaign was a terrible tragedy. The attempt by the Allies to seize the Gallipoli peninsula from the Ottoman turks and gain control over the strategically important Dardanelles failed in a welter of hubris, blood and suffering. A terrible, solemn, tragedy, indeed. The battle of Gallipoli did actually happen as did the alliance of Turkey with Germany in WWW1. The movie also touched on some unhistorical skirmishes with Greek militia presented like pirates of the Caribbean, but it did not, conveniently, touch on the Armenian genocide in progress by the turks during and after WWW1, and certainly in the days during and after Gallipoli. It is rather perplexing as to why Russell Crow, an accomplished actor, participated in this movie, in a role that seemed to have kept him below average."
" Brilliant film with perfect cast
",0.8176,0.9726,2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"It always a pleasant surprise when a famous actor turns out to be a great director - particularly since it happens so rarely! Russel Crowe definitely belongs to those rare few.
He has made essentially the perfect movie, keeping the delicate balance between a family drama, love story and historical war depiction.
Very well cast, beautifully filmed and with a skillful use of music.
This film leaves you with a good, hopeful feeling and a conviction that there are people out there who understand the humanity in all cultures and that every battle has two sides."
" Ridiculous plot and Turkish agitprop.
",-0.3612,0.128,2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,"This straight-to-DVD contraption, besides having absolutely absurd plot, serves as a blatant pro-Ottoman propaganda. Save your time, seriously."
" The Water Diviner
",0.0772,-0.9256,2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,"Russell Crowe made his directorial debut in this heartfelt drama.Crowe plays Joshua Connor, a farmer and water diviner. A father grieving the loss of his three sons in the battlefield of Gallipoli in World War One, he also subsequently loses his wife.Connor goes off to Turkey to locate his son's bodies and bring them back to Australia. The British soldiers will not allow Connor to visit the battlefield. However Major Hasan who commanded the Turkish troops and now aiding the locating of missing soldiers helps Connor.It is a story of a damaged man rediscovering his humanity and something more. Hasan is the former enemy who is more helpful than he needs to be. Turkey is a country at a crossroad in its history facing a post war nationalist uprising led by Ataturk.Connor also befriends a boy and starts a relationship with his widowed mother Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) who operates the hotel at Istanbul he is staying in. Ayshe's brother in law is eyeing up marriage but Connor upsets his plans.Crowe has directed a sensitive poignant drama with a touch of magical realism. It could easily been an overblown ridiculous melodrama which early on it shows signs off. Crowe pulls back and gives it some heart."
" TWD: A Mock Redaction of Legends of the Fall
",-0.4215,0.9638,2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"""The Water Diviner,"" (2014). Directed by Russell Crowe. Starring Russell Crowe, Olga Kurylenko, and Yilmaz Edogan. This is a wonderful movie. It is, in fact, a redaction of the mock epic,""Legends of the Fall,"" (LOTF). The writers, Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios, must have analyzed the plot points and determined that some of them needed to be corrected because their impetus was based on faulty humanistic ideals. For instance, in LOTF, the three Ludlow boys go off to join WWI because they feel a patriotism to Germany and their cousins in the war. But in TWD, to Connor, the guiding principle for going to war is to make a statement of principle rather than land acquisition. There are many such dichotomies. Included in the dichotomies is the point of view of the Turks, the invaded country, by a ranking colonel of the enemy forces, played by Yilmaz Erdogan. This film reflects a humanistic, enlightened world view. And it shows us the transformation of the power of familial love. This is a point-of-view movie that will lift the spirit. In the beginning of the movie, we see how geographical empath Connor uses his gift to find water. But as the story progresses, we see Connor develop his spiritual powers to be of service to people who need him. It's a wonderfully uplifting film and touches that which is human in us.
This movie is on Netflix. 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!"
" Crowes attempt to ingratiate himself with Turkey
",0.0,-0.4753,2020-01-14 00:00:00,3,"All very one sided: painting the british as colonial aggressors and Turks as the oppressed - when, infact, turkey has been involved in more than its own far share of genocides! I can only assume this was funded by Erdogan?"
" This shows the greatness of the British Empire
",0.0,0.9961,2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,"I thought this film was great, it was historically accurate and although they could've chosen a more entertaining non-fiction story from the time, the one they chose was a blast, very interesting and so meaningful especially considering it's a real story. It was a great story but for it to of been better it should've explained more of the characters backstory so we could know the characters more, I felt there was a slight lack of character development in this film.I loved how the British man in charge of the British Army's colonial presence in Turkey treated the Australian father, those scenes were my favourite as a Brit. I loved how the British soldier treated the Australian father like a child and was patronising to him as it showed the greatness of the British Empire at the time, the high respect it welded and the authority that they commanded over their conquered people outside of Britain. The British soldier really acted like a strict but caring fatherly figure to the Australian main character, it gives an accurate depiction of the British armed forces of the time. Overall it was a great film, definitely worth watching if you're into history and could've been better if their was more time for the most important and entertaining characters to flesh their personality out onscreen. Also could've been better if it focused more on the people of the time's thoughts on the British Empire, Imperialism and racism."
" That was awesome

" Never give up. Focus!
",0.0,0.9312,2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Too often we find ourselves wrapped up in yesterday struggling to make today. The hope for what could happen tomorrow can become obscure if we lose our perspective. This is a movie that brings that determination to the forefront in a way the pulls you along with the sights, sounds and raw emotions of a pure love, a dreadful war and an inspiring dream. Russell Crowe leads us from yesterday into the future without missing second along the way. See this film with friends, family or immerse yourself in it. The journey is harsh and real but one that refreshes the spirit and encourages you to never give up on anything you love."
" Beautiful film that explores wisps of hope found through countless tragedies
",0.5994,-0.9954,2019-10-28 00:00:00,9,"I try to watch as many movies as I can about war, so I added The Water Diviner to my watchlist as soon as it hit Netflix. A movie set after the action admittedly sounded like it risked being boring; however, this was anything but.Russell Crowe plays a stoic, even docile father whose soft-spoken manner doesn't get in the way of his ambition to risk inconvenience, travel, and even injury and death to find the bodies of his sons lost in the Battle of Gallipoli. He knows their date of death and that they died together--nothing else. He travels to Turkey, meeting various characters who either help or hinder his efforts. Jai Courtney (an actor I've been seeing a lot lately who excels in historical roles) is interesting and demanding of attention here in the short time he's on screen. Olga Kurylenko gives a noteworthy performance as Ayshe, and Yilmaz Erdogan's character of Major Hasan was both layered and respectful.The Water Diviner avoids over-dramatizing for the sake of Hollywood drama (save for the last shot of the film, though its inclusion was understandable after the gut-wrenching affair the rest of the film puts its audience through). One must give credit to the film for showing the nuance and various layers to all sides of the war and its participants. Major Hasan (at one point in the movie blamed for the deaths of the brothers) is a complex and interesting character that, in any other movie, could be portrayed as the simple ""enemy"". Instead, The Water Diviner strives to remain unbiased in terms of war and politics and remains focused on the human condition.Action scenes are not scarce in the film, either. The movie actually opens up with one, though more are sprinkled throughout the film as both flashbacks of the Battle of Gallipoli and as new struggles Crowe has to get through as a foreigner in Turkey during a time of unrest. It's not as action-packed as some war movies given its subject matter, but regardless, The Water Diviner never bored me. It did make me tear up during one phenomenal scene showing the aftermath of a charge (men bleeding out, missing pieces of themselves, crying and groaning), and that's usually hard to do. I applaud this film for tearing through my heart like a meat grinder; the brutal realities of war are explored in full here, as is the devastating aftermath on the people the dead leave behind.Overall, I loved The Water Diviner. Full of tragedy and the exploration of the human condition in two cultures on either side of a bloody divide, this was one hell of a movie. I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in history or war and who can stomach its brutal realities."

",0.0,0.7995,2019-08-21 00:00:00,3,Wtf?!! I thought this rubbish was going to be a riveting movie about the tragic loss of a whole generation at Gallipoli. Instead we get a movie about Russell Crowe. I think it was poorly cast and the only great piece of acting was from Ryan Corr who was brilliant might I add. Other than that this movie was based on Rusty's giant ego and even bigger head. Don't get me wrong. Russell Crowe has done some of the greatest acting I have ever seen in a beautiful mind and romper stomper but as a director and producer. I'm afraid his ego got the better of him in this 1. What are these morons who reviewed this movie thinking?!! It's crap!!!

",0.3989,-0.9906,2019-07-08 00:00:00,8,"Jesus this movie was so tense like Russell Crowes character was always been chased around by the armies. Like seriously, your heart is beating so fast every time he is always been chased lol. At least his character got out alive as well as the eldest son who was unfortunately the last surviving one out of his 2 poor brothers who lost their lives in the war. The sound of cries would really depress you because you would feel helpless as a viewer for not helping the wounded. I mean this really happened folks at the time when soldiers were badly injured and didn't get the help they needed. It's very traumatizing and heartbreaking that many lives were lost during that time.May the victims who lost their lives during the war never be forgotten <3"

" ""Because he's the only father who came looking.""
",0.0,-0.9451,2019-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The story has only a tenuous connection to the title of the movie. Russell Crowe's character, Joshua Connor, who used his divining ability to locate water wells on his farmland, somehow translates this ability to locating the remains of his three sons missing in battle at Gallipoli, Turkey in 1915 during World War I. I'm not sure if that was the best way to demonstrate his resolve in finding his sons, all presumed to have died during that campaign. The film could have been made without the 'water diviner' connection, as the presence of Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) was instrumental in locating the exact battlefield where the casualties took place. The mystical visions Connor experienced at the battle site, now a vast graveyard, were too conveniently effective to establish where his sons were buried, not to mention the overwhelming odds of finding the dog tags of two of the dead sons by his Aussie hosts.What's effective in the film, as mentioned earlier, is Joshua Connor's resolve to locate his sons as a final promise granted to his wife. Her death is perhaps meant to be purposely ambiguous, as it's called an accident by Joshua, though my thoughts immediately went to suicide in despondency over the family she lost. Which would only be exacerbated if her husband were not to return from his dauntless task. The story also effectively demonstrates how former enemies, Turks and Aussies, could set aside their differences from the war to pay respects to the fallen at Gallipoli. In particular, Joshua, who was not a soldier, was able to suppress his initial hatred for Major Hasan to eventually prove himself a valuable ally.The hint of a potential romance between Joshua and the Turkish hotel owner Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) wasn't as distracting from the principal story as it might have been. Again, initial impressions served to foster a dislike for each other, with the presence of Ayshe's son (Dylan Georgiades) a mitigating factor. The film doesn't seek closure on their relationship, though one can probably read between the lines well enough. Joshua's discovery of his remaining son (Ryan Corr) who survived the Battle of Gallipoli was handled with some suspension of disbelief, while his confession of battle field circumstances regarding the death of brother Ed the most heart wrenching aspect of the movie."

This was a movie that I had lying around and for no better use of my evening, I decided to watch it.

" A moving and sensitive picture about an Australian father who attempts to find his sons , being Russell Crowe's directorial debut.
",0.0,-0.9202,2018-02-13 00:00:00,8,"After the Battle of Gallipoli, in 1915, an Aussie farmer called Connor (Russell Crowe), travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli to attempt locate his three sons , allegedly missing in action . At a hotel he meets a beautiful widow (Olga Kurylenko who learned Turkish for her character), and later on he tries to find out a way in arrive to Gallipoli , where reportedly died his children . As he must travel across the war-torn landscape with the help of a British Lt Colonel called Hughes (Jai Courtney) and a Turkish Officer (Erdogan) . Meanwhile , there takes place the Greek-Turkish war and the invasion of Smirna by the Greeks . As it is set during the Turkish War of Independence, in revolutionary days during fall of the Ottoman Empire . The War resulted the defeat of Greece in Western Turkey (Greco-Turkish war), on the East, Armenian state and Britain, France and Georgia.
This is a family story in which is treated thought-provoking issues with a tough man holding onto hope, fighting for a desire , and bringing to life a promise . Australian Russell Crowe gives an acceptable actiing as the Aussie father who goes out to find his 3 missing sons and while staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he falls in love with a gorgeous widow. The charming Olga Kurylenko is good as the attractive widow mistreated by his brother-in-law who wants to marry her . Support cast is pretty well , such as Jai Courtney , Isabel Lucas and Jacqueline McKenzie who also starred with Crowe in the 1992 hit Romper Stomper . And some fine Turks actors as Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan who are both comedy actors in Turkey .
 It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar-winning cameraman Andrew Lesnie , being his final movie . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by David Hirschfelder , helped by Lisa Gerard .The motion picture was stunningly acted/produced/directed by Russell Crowe . The picture gives an interesting portrayal about the bloody campaign and battle of Gallipoli . There happened the following : The Gallipoli Campaign, also known as the Dardanelles Campaign, the Battle of Gallipoli, or the Battle of Çanakkale , was a campaign of the First World War that took place on the Gallipoli peninsula (Gelibolu in modern Turkey) in the Ottoman Empire between 17 February 1915 and 9 January 1916. The peninsula forms the northern bank of the Dardanelles, a strait that provided a sea route to the Russian Empire, one of the Allied powers during the war. Intending to secure it, Russia's allies, Britain and France, launched a naval attack followed by an amphibious landing on the peninsula, with the aim of capturing the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (modern Istanbul).The naval attack was repelled and after eight months' fighting, with many casualties on both sides, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force was withdrawn to Egypt.The campaign was the only major Ottoman victory of the war. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand national consciousness; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as ""Anzac Day"", the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing Remembrance Day , Armistice Day .The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey eight years later, with Mustafa Kemal (Kemal Atatürk) as President, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli. Mustafa Kemal, Attaturk commanded the Turkish national movement in the war of independence. His successful military campaigns led to liberation of the country and to the establishing of Turkey. He transformed the former Ottoman Empire into a democratic, modern, secular nation-state , his reforms are referred as Kemalism. Ankara became the new capital and Kemal abolished the Caliphate and Sultanate. ."

" Respect
",0.4767,0.4578,2018-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack, and I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback, well, I waltzed my Matilda all over.
Then in 1915, my country said son, It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done.
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun, and they marched me away to the war.And the band played Waltzing Matilda, as the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears, we sailed off for Gallipoli
And how well I remember that terrible day, how our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay, we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well. He shower'd us with bullets,
And he rained us with shell. And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.But the band played Waltzing Matilda, when we stopped to bury our slain.
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, then we started all over again.
And those that were left, well we tried to survive, in that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive, though around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head, and when I woke up in my hospital bed,
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead. Never knew there was worse things than dyin'.For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda, all around the green bush far and free
To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs-no more waltzing Matilda for me.
So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed, and they shipped us back home to Australia.
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane, those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay, I looked at the place where me legs used to be.
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me, to grieve, to mourn, and to pity.But the band played Waltzing Matilda, as they carried us down the gangway.
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, then they turned all their faces away
And so now every April, I sit on me porch, and I watch the parades pass before me.
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march, reviving old dreams of past glories
And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore. They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, what are they marching for? And I ask myself the same question.But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, and the old men still answer the call,
But as year follows year, more old men disappear. Someday no one will march there at all.
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?And the band played Waltzing Matilda Eric Bogle"
" Story starts OK, but then quickly disintegrates. Historic dishonesty kills it.
",-0.5836,-0.9773,2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,"This movie starts with some beautiful wide shots, then quickly turns sentimental. When the father arrives in Turkey to look for his sons after the battle of Gallipoli, the story seems to hold up, but quickly starts disintegrating into non-relevant elements. Towards the end it's getting weak and very hard to watch. Think soap-opera cheesy. 
I was also very irritated by the attempts at whitewashing Ottoman/Turkish history. First this happens when visiting the Blue Mosque, where the father is so surprised to acknowledge that such a beautiful thing does not exist in his culture. Well, maybe not in Australia, but sitting next to it is the Hagia Sophia, until modern times the building with the largest dome, which was a Christian Church until it was captured by the same Ottomans during their conquest of the Byzantine (Roman) Empire. The Hagia Sophia is thus an expression of the same culture that led to the culture of Australia. Second, during the second half, Greeks are painted as truly evil villains against the noble Turks, whereas during the period of 1914-1922 is known by historians as the Greek genocide: the systematic genocide of the Christian Ottoman Greek population from Turkey, by the Ottoman Empire's government. Third, the movie is also completely silent about the Armenian genocide from 1915-1923 where the same (Islamic) government exterminated 1.5 million (Christian) Armenians, something acknowledged by international scholars, but denied by Turkish government to this day. That same genocide has been the inspiration for Hitler's genocide against among others the Jews during World War 2. He said of it:""Our strength consists in our speed and in our brutality. Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter -- with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. It's a matter of indifference to me what a weak western European civilization will say about me.I have issued the command -- and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad -- that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness -- for the present only in the East -- with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?""Hitler was well aware that denial of the Armenian genocide was a strong signal that his tyranny would not be opposed by the civilized world. It is telling that Russell Crowe sought Turkish approval, and the Turkish minister of culture told him ""I believe in the script."". That's the same minister who's responsible for Article 301 in the penal code, which has been used to prosecute Turkish citizens who have brought the Armenian genocide to the attention of the people.
No wonder Armenian and Greek organizations have called for a boycot of this film."
" Pretty bad and historically disrespectful
",-0.0772,-0.9822,2017-12-25 00:00:00,2,"The water diviner with his sixth sense and his superior martial skills make this movie pretty bad. Historical inaccuracies and distortions make it plainly disturbing.
The time this movie takes place is very special for the Ottoman Empire. Before WWI the empire was probably the most multicultural country of that time. Gallipoli is the greek name of the city, at least this is shown in the movie, Turks use a different name. After the war, Turkish nationalism and religious fanaticism rose significantly. Hate and crimes towards Greek, Armenian and Assyrian citizens started during the war and reached the point of genocide. All we see in this movie is how the Turkish suffered from the Greek invasion which started in 1919. 6-7 years after the Turks had set in motion their ethnic cleansing. Yes, of course this bred too much hate from Greeks towards Turks. Greeks are shown as a pile of dirty and purely evil criminals attacking ""all innocent"" Turks, no comment, no context.
A couple years later Turks achieved their ethnic cleansing and the Ottoman Empire became Turkey. Turkey still doesn't recognise these genocides, although many countries do, such as Germany and Netherlands.
Movie ending: ""This film is dedicated to all those who remain lost and nameless and who live on in the hearts and memories of their families"" is just too disrespectful considering these."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.9929,2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of the year.Very nice cinematography - quite impressive. Nice story line and dialogues. Great first movie from Russel Crowe as a Director - just WAOW.All Actors are great - Olga Kurylenko impressed me very much. Russel Crowe is extremely good as always and the Actors playing British officers were great. Turkish Actors were well selected and acted very well. Loved both the Major and the Sergeant.The story about the 3 lost brothers really touched me. The battle scenes in Gallipoli took my breath away .... and a few tears as well.I advise it to people who love epic movies, beautiful stories and cinematography. Looking forward to Russel Crowe's next movie !!"
" An earnest, but flawed, first entry for Crowe.
",0.2846,0.9582,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"One cannot watch this movie without experiencing mixed emotions.This is a well-meaning and earnest film which flaws are the consequence of poorly considered and unbalanced writing and character construction, as well as somewhat simplistic stereotypes.it is not an issue that only 3 women feature in substantial roles in the film; my issue is the positioning of these women. The first is Connor's wife, the mother of his sons, and crucial to the motivation of the plot; we can't expect much of her, given that all we need to know is that the loss of her children understandably induces the loss of her sanity. It is tragic but brief; She rarely features even in flashbacks. The second, Olga Kurylenko's character, is a strong-willed but socially subjugated widow obsessed with her MIA husband; the entirety of her screen time is expended either discussing her missing spouse, the pressure to marry her brother- in-law, her obligations to her son and flirting with Connor; while her character contributes to the story by providing a window into Ottoman Turkish household culture, she really is little more than a love interest for Russel Crowe; the third character is the inn's resident Circassian prostitute - need i say more. It possibly sounds worse than it is. While the female characters are far from purely objectified, they seem to provide little more than support to an otherwise predominantly male film. While failing the Bechdel test, it still manages to be sensitive and relatively respectful, at least at a tertiary level.like almost all Australian films that feature British characters, practically every Briton in this film is a cartoon-like, two-dimensional stereotype; the most prominent of which is of course the absolute favourite of Aussie filmmakers: the stuffy, pompous, and insensitive martinet army officer. The only broadly sympathetic British character is a junior naval officer about the right age for a midshipman, but who is bizarrely addressed as a lieutenant, which is very weird. Perhaps predictably for an Australian film about Gallipoli, the real enemy is the Pommie. This adds a two-dimensional and callow aspect to a story which attempts to address a particularly complex period of history; there is absolutely no consideration for depth in relation to any of the British characters whatsoever. -the treatment of the Turkish characters, and Turkish history in this period, is probably the biggest issue,with this film. Australian historiography relating to the Turks at Gallipoli tends towards the respectful and the positive, which may explain the political position of the film, and which by itself is not a problem; but it is the treatment of the Turkish political position in the post-war period that becomes galling; without exception, the Turks are portrayed as the innocent victims of foreign imperialism and aggression; simple, decent and patriotic; every Turkish soldier, for example, is noble and honourable. They are shown as the victim of atrocities committed by the invading Greeks, who feature only sufficiently to identify them as bloodthirsty and murderous monsters bent on genocide and rapine; no mention whatsoever is made of Turkish atrocities against the Greeks, or the Armenians, or anyone else. I don't mean to detract from the quantity of undoubtedly upstanding and decent Turkish men who served their country at this time, but neither do i think that this film's portrayal represents anything like a well- rounded perspective of the period. As a comparison, it would literally be impossible to find a contemporary German film about ww2 which did not feature at least one Character who was a Nazi.For all its faults, it still manages to project a sense of charm, even while featuring anything as dubious as water-divining. The photography is generally appropriately attractive, the scenery is often enchanting, and the standard of acting is relatively high. The Turkish landscape is wonderfully showcased and the Turkish actors are all competent if not outstanding. If Crowe intends a transition into directing, then this is a strong, albeit flawed, starting point."
