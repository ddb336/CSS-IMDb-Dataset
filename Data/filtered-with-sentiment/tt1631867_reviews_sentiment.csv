" Great movie, great concept
",0.8481,0.4215,2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,If you liked the concept of this movie I´m recommending you to watch show called Re:Zero (2016).
" Pure popcorn entertainment. Love or hate Tom Cruise, there's something for everyone here
",0.5106,0.9812,2021-03-23 00:00:00,9,"The Good: Whilst based from a Japanese graphic-novel, it's pretty original from a Hollywood perspective. The time-loop premise is handled well, it doesn't confuse the viewer and is used as a tool (not just a gimmick) to keep you engaged and the story moving. Tom Cruise also plays against type in this movie and he gets killed, a lot (not a spoiler, it's the movie's primary theme, central plot piece and was used to sell the movie). And of course, with Tom Cruise there are a lot of practical effects to, which always make action films and the cinematography pop.The Bad: Gets a little bit cliched at the end, with some leaps of logic required. Fortunately, it doesn't break the film. As it's just simple too good for the rest of its runtime. I wouldn't say it's a bad ending, just not a satisfactory resolution to the character arc.Should you watch it? Yes. Definitely. A shame that the marketing team did such a poor job of promoting the film, even the title does not do the film any favours - the movie definitely has the chops for mass appeal. There is nothing gratuitous in the movie. And you like it even if you love Tom Cruise (he's in the film giving it his all) or you find him annoying (he dies a lot and plays against his typecast) - you'll find something to enjoy in this movie. Very highly recommended."
" Utterly original
",0.3804,0.907,2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,So many sci fi movies are rehash's of other films. This one is totally original and quite entertaining. Tom Cruise is his usual bland self but the action scenes are solid and the supporting cast is excellent.I also liked hearing the Australian accents throughout the movie. 8 stars.
" A good comeback for Tom Cruise
",0.4404,0.8718,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"It's a decent movie, with a good plot and good acting; I highly recommend it if you are a Tom Cruise fan."
" Good
",0.4404,0.7324,2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,It's a great movie which does a good job on representing the power of restarting life. Not the best movie but enjoyable in it's genre.
" Interesting, intense and even witty ... but let down by the ending
",0.25,0.5267,2021-02-19 00:00:00,6,I would have rated this film much higher if it had ended 5 minutes before it did. A satisfying conclusion was reached and then they added on another one.
" Military-Entrtainment complex fools yet again
",-0.4939,-0.7783,2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Was everyone who reviewed this movie six years old and hopped up on sugar?
I'm amazed and disheartened by peoples idiocy.
This, in the first 5 minutes is an attempt to cynically evoke the memories, and thus wholesome patriotic virtues by recasting the historical WWII battle for Europe.
Thre fact that the 'aliens' originate in Hamburg is no coincidence, and the master plan is a simile of D-Day.
With America and the U.N. Suffering from an image problem, it seems wise from the viewpoint of the U.S. to remind the world that they once believed they fought for freedom and blah blah.
I suspect the 'time loop' trope is to remind us to be ever vigilant ( and thus reliant on good 'ol U.S of A ).
The Germans I'm sure have endured enough without this barely concealed political trite from a nation so hypocritical it has forgotten what it stands for.
For those of you who think I have no basis for such a charge, simply search ' military-entertainment complex ' and you may realise that many action blockbusters are in fact, recruitment tools and simply plain propaganda.
There's nothing wrong with enjoying a film, as long as you don't suspend critical thinking."
" Excellent and unique movie of all time
",0.5719,0.4588,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,Best and most underrated movie of all time. No words to say.
" Interesting sci-fi
",0.4019,0.8271,2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,"It was an fascinating sci-fi film. The plot was intellectual and exciting. There were some bits bothered me, but overall it was a good film"
" Brilliant Film, one of my personal favorites
",0.765,0.9937,2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"It's hard to compromise how a film of such similar plot development to Groundhog Day can be considered to be such a great action movie, but like the events in this film, you just have to see it to believe it. Edge of Tomorrow is honestly my favorite Tom Cruise movie, and when you have such a great track record like Cruise, that's really saying something. The film is phenomenal, as with Groundhog Day it follows a similar plot, but it certainly has a different way at going at the themes it develops. Cruise and Blunt make a terrific pair in this action/sci-fi/thriller and the film is nothing short of brilliant. The special effects are mesmerizing, the look of the film daunting, and yet nostalgic and fully realized. I love the development of the world we find our characters in, and all the aliens it involves. I love nearly every aspect of this film, and although on the surface it may not seem original, it certainly feels that way. In the end, Edge of Tomorrow is a must see action flick that will have audiences on the edge of their seats, and is a must see for any Sci-=fi or Cruise fan in general.
My Rating: 10/10"
" Live. Watch Edge of Tomorrow. Enjoy this Gem. Repeat
",0.4939,0.9967,2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I am Writing this review after watching this Critically and Commercially successful film(for the 9th or 10th time I guess).
Action packed and intense film filled with amazing story, wonderful visuals, superb direction, great screenplay and undoubtedly absolutely great Performances of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.
Tom & Emily is Iconic duo which i would love to see together again( Sequel is in development as per Jan 2021).
Looking back at this film after 7 years of its release, I can say this for sure that this film Deserves more praise & should had done more business in its theatrical run. It should had been nominated for awards. Tom & Emily both gave brilliant performances, the film was absolutely fantastic, Screenplay and Visuals were over the mark. Doug Liman really showed his direction skils.
Edge of Tomorrow was Award worthy in every way. It was snubbed off the awards, so were Tom & Emily.
Hope its sequel would be as Good as The First one or even better. This time it should get the recognition from the Academy and should prove to be a Blockbuster.
This film will always be in my Top Films List and Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt will always be one of my Top Stars."

Movie is really fun, you can also feel some nice humor at proper times, making the movie also pretty nice for watching in family/groups & wider people circles. The horror component also is there, though somewhat minor, it's mainly the sci-fi+action thing. Netflix is a good option where to watch the movie, though I think once I encountered the movie on TV.

" Groundhog's Day on Steroids
",0.0,0.9962,2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I've never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he was exceptional in this film. I love the transformation of his facial expressions, at the beginning he is scared and ready to run, but by the end he is confident in every action he makes. The biggest thing that really helped the movie stand out is Emily Blunt. She Highlights Tom Cruises role and brings out funny moments in the film. I love the humor mixed in with action, with a splash of romance. The filming was great and the CGI was not over done. They did a great job bringing authenticity to the film with an interesting plot and great props. Tom cruise reliving the day, while he tries to save the world, a very upgraded groundhog's day film. Loved it."

" A movie that I ended up enjoying a lot
",0.5267,0.9776,2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"The performance of Tom Cruise and the cast crew is sensational. It's also very pleasant to know that Doug Liman in the direction and McQuarrie in the penning knew how to adapt very well the manga ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka on which the story is based.
Regarding the plot adaptation, it's undoubtedly an exciting film with excellent suspense. The action scenes are very intense, and personally I like that background where the protagonist can go back in time to avoid making the same mistakes. It is a super power that without a doubt you wish you had but without having to pay for it with your life. Some might say that it is an inspiration between Groundhog Day, The Butterfly Effect and The War of the Worlds in a Halo version, but I think it surpasses all that, since the special effects and the war scenes mean that the repetitions are not so boring, and the virulent nature of the aliens allows somehow to justify their actions (on the other hand, in other movies like The War of the Worlds or Independence Day this is a great plot flaw in my opinion).
Better than I was expecting and worth to watch when it comes to feeling and enjoying intense scenes :)"

" Maybe the best Time Loop film
",0.6369,0.9872,2020-12-07 00:00:00,9,"We don't talk enough about how this is one of the best sci fi and action flicks of the 21st Century so far. The exploration and execution of the time loop stuff is amazing. Exciting and inventive and never confusing despite how much it keeps going through the same thing. Sets up and deconstructs its rules in a brilliant way. Cruise, Blunt, Paxton and everyone are loose, funny and perfect. Everything tracks and pays off. I think the climax is a little murky and not quite as exhilarating as what came before. Great, great, great flick."

" One of the best Sci-Fi style romance story
",0.8316,0.9818,2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,"On top of an excellent Sci-Fi action fiction this is a great romance story. Intentionally or not but the lead actors behave like a couple that is deeply in love. From the first words ""Who sent you soldier ?"" the girl's look betrays her subconscious feeling that it is not a random encounter. And as the plot develops their emotional bond is constantly growing. She pushes him around, shoots w/o hesitation and doing here best to stay in control, whereas he does not care because he feels that she is the one. He grows dramatically as man while staying with her and works hard to protect her. In the final scene he comes to see her after accomplishing the mission, smiles when hearing her ""Who sent you.."", it is obvious that he is not leaving alone. The next line could read like ""We have met before, I am you before Verdun.."""
" You best darn watch this, maggot
",0.6369,0.8555,2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Good movie, story, acting, humour, solid entertainment."
" Very Enjoyable Action Sci-Fi
",0.4927,0.9695,2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"With bold choices in plot and development, Edge of Tomorrow delivers the right amounts of action and sci-fi. While it does lack a bit in secondary character development, it helps to keep things tight and the viewer hooked on the plat/action.+ Fast paced and unusually structured plot works very well, while avoiding genres clichés.
+ Good action scenes and EFX.
+ Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt deliver strong performances as usual, and both are adequately cast for both action and character driven scenes.
+ Budget is adequate to scope.
Backup cast acting and characters falls short.Overall, a great treat for Action Sci-Fi fans, and a safe watch for those looking for an enjoyable fast paced movie to watch, without a long explanation-heavy first act (as is so common to this genre)."
" Learn by your mistakes: lesson 1 - don't bother.
",-0.119,0.8907,2020-11-13 00:00:00,6,"This isn't a sci-fi film, it's a glorified video game with people - and after the umpteenth repetition of the scenario in which office-based Tom Cruise (""Maj. Cage"") has to engage with the sceptical squadron of soldiers charged with stopping an alien enemy from invading the world, I had long since given up caring. Emily Blunt clearly has more patience than I do, as she seems to be one of the few capable of working with Cruise (and boffin Noah Taylor) to persevere through these time-loops hoping each time to find out new information and tactics so as to eventually break this stalemate and to combat their lethal foe. The action scenes and effects are great and to be fair, the last half hour is quite an exciting watch - but the writing and acting (Jonas Armstrong should have stuck to Lincoln Green) are flat with a storyline that is, frankly, derivative in the extreme and just all a bit boring. Sorry - seen it all before, and original is usually best."
" A must see
",0.0,0.9786,2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,A superb film that has a great blend of humour and action. Tom Cruise is excellent and there is a strong supporting cast led by Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton.The engaging story is well managed and the repeated reset to Cage's day doesn't get repetitive as you are kept on the edge of your seat willing them to get further each time they try.
" Even better the second time
",0.4404,0.954,2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed EOT the first time, but didn't realise just how good it was until last night, when watching it again in 4K on our new 49"" Sony telly, uhm, also acquired through Amazon! If you have already seen The Edge of Tomorrow, I do recommend a second viewing. So much detail, so many scenes that matter and carry the story. Lots to miss the first time! Even 6 years later, the visual effects are tack sharp. The acting equally so - TC is perfect for this role, as is Emily Blunt for hers. It's interesting to see TC in a vulnerable state, and shows how versatile he is. I know other reviews have mentioned this, but the battle sequences were so similar to D Day landing scenes in WW2 movies, I thought is was a thoughtful to make the connection between our response to a dangerous enemy and the carnage that ensues when you fight back en mass, local or ET. The end titles were awesome too, very retro 80s 3D graphics. Reminded me of Tron.
I would happily watch EOT a 3rd time. Very rare I even watch a movie twice!"
" The Firy Crucible
",0.0,-0.3744,2020-11-06 00:00:00,3,"Most reviewers mention the similarity to 'Groundhog Day' of the plot of this typically long and exhausting Tom Cruise action movie (with the usual wobbly steadicam photography, which is to 21st Century filmmaking what the zoom lens was to the seventies), although it's initial attitude is more 'Starship Troopers'. There are also similarities to 'Nightmare on Elm Street', among others.Those more steeped in seriously old movies will spot echoes of Henry Hathaway's 'Peter Ibbetson' (1935) and Marcel Carne's 'Juliette ou la Cle des Songes' (1951), and some tropes would doubtless be found less elaborately and ponderously executed in silent cinema if one looked."
" Edge of Tomorrow review
",0.0,0.9996,2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw the trailer for Edge of Tomorrow, the first thing that came to mind was ""this movie is going to be stupid."" I must admit, I had very low expectations when I walked into the theater to watch this film. However, like a true underdog, Edge of Tomorrow proved me wrong in the best possible way. I left that theater thrilled that I took a chance to watch this movie.Director Doug Liman and his film crew deliver a smart, funny, exciting and very well paced film that will have audiences laughing, deep in thought and at the edge of their seats all at the same time. The film is backed by great performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.Story and SettingEdge of Tomorrow is an action sci-fi film that takes place at some unknown time in the future were an asteroid brings a parasitic alien race known as Mimics that quickly begins to take over Europe, threatening to spread to the rest of the world.The humans do not go down without a fight however and win a key battle in this interspecies war. Major William Cage (Cruise) travels to London to meet with General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), who has plans to defeat the Mimics in one last aggressive attack. Cage, a media spokesman for the U.S. military, is surprised to find that Brigham wants him fighting on the frontlines.Having no previous combat experience, Cage desperately tries to avoid being enlisted for the battle. He is eventually captured and forced to fight. Within minutes of entering battle, Cage is killed. Strangely, he wakes up back at the barracks the day before the battle. The process repeats every time Cage dies, indicating he is stuck in a type of time-loop. In order to stop this loop, Cage must defeat the Mimics once and for all.
Things don't go very well when the Mimics invade.Things don't go very well when the Mimics invade.If this story sounds familiar, that is because Edge of Tomorrow is based on the book All You Need is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Not too surprising, the film diverges quite a bit from the book in many areas, particularly the ending. Fans looking for a very faithful adaption may be disappointed.As strange as this set-up seems, Liman makes it work very well. The film's plot avoids being confusing by offering clear, though not always logical, explanations for what is happening.The pacing is very well executed as it keeps the film moving along quickly without overwhelming the viewer. The film always takes a moment to pause and give the audience just enough time to catch-up and figure out what is going on.The film also brilliantly avoids being repetitive by breezing through all the stuff the viewers have seen before and only showing new/important interactions and developments. There are even instances where the audience is seeing a particular event for the first time but that Cage has relived dozens of times, sparing us the failed attempts and fluff in between.One very surprising aspect of the film was how funny it was. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and is not afraid to poke fun at the idea of dying repeatedly. The dialogue between the characters is also very witty. Honestly, I would almost consider Edge of Tomorrow an action-comedy.Unfortunately, the film loses its tempo towards the final act. It seems like the filmmakers felt they ran out of time and quickly started speeding toward the conclusion. Things are not as well explained and the comedic element fades away. The ending itself can be a bit confusing. There isn't much doubt as to what happened more so than why it happened.Regardless, the closing act isn't terrible and certainly not enough to bring the whole film down. The rest of the film is funny, intelligent and just overall entertaining.CharactersPart of what makes Edge of Tomorrow so interesting is its two leading protagonists: Cage and Rita.Cage is really unlike any character Cruise has played before. He is a cowardly man that is the furthest thing from a badass at the start of the film. The idiot doesn't even know how to turn-off the safety on his gun the first time he enters battle. This of course sets him up for a lot character development.Cage really is a different character at the end of the movie. Constant reliving, training and fighting forges him into a marine-level soldier by films end. He is also smarter and capable of looking at the whole picture beyond his own personal gain.
Audience may not be used to Tom Cruise acting so vulnerable.Audiences may not be used to Tom Cruise acting so vulnerable.In fact, I might say Cage transforms a bit too much. It is not totally unbelievable for him to become a super badass soldier; the guy trained before and fought in the same battle hundreds of times over. However, I just feel there is very little if any remnants of the old Cage towards the end.Cruise really nails it as Cage. He is really convincing as a clueless coward and as the kickass solider he develops into. You could tell he was enjoying the role. This role isn't exactly what audiences are used to from Cruise but he delivered and showed his flexibility as an actor.Equally interesting and entertaining is the character Rita Vrataski played by Emily Blunt. Rita is a strong female lead done in the best way possible. She is confident, independent, skilled, fearless and just an all-around badass.What really makes her stand out though is that she still appears very human despite being portrayed as an emotionless soldier. More importantly, the filmmakers accomplish this without making her overly vulnerable or turning her into a damsel in distress. For those that feel women are miss or underrepresented in media, Rita will no doubt be a breath of fresh air.Blunt could have easily stole the show as Rita, but, for better or worse, the filmmakers were careful not to let her take away from Cruise's screen time. The film makes it clear that Cage is the hero, which is just fine, but it feels like this was done by underselling Rita slightly. This is particularly noticeable in the final act where Rita's role is diminished.
Blunt's Rita is a strong female lead done right.Blunt's Rita is a strong female lead done right.One thing I feel Edge of Tomorrow really nailed was the relationship between Cage and Rita. So often I feel like characters in films fall in love too quickly or under the most unrealistic of circumstances. That is certainly not the case in this film.While Cage does fall for Rita, it is completely understandable as he relives the same day with her a hundred times over. On the flipside, Rita doesn't share these feelings as she never knows him for more than a day at a time. I'm glad the filmmakers were fully aware of this fact and didn't try to force an unrealistic or unnecessary romance.Edge of Tomorrow is the Cage and Rita show no question. The rest of the supporting cast is just barely there. There isn't anything special or particularly interesting about them. The soldiers in Cage's J Squad unit play a bigger role towards the end but they still take a far back seat to the heroes. Normally this would bother me, but, in this case, Cage and Rita have plenty of character to go around.The Mimics work well as fearsome antagonists for the most part. There designs are fairly otherworldly and their ability to move quickly underground and snatch up soldiers like free swag makes them intimidating. The concept of Mimics functioning like a nervous system of sorts is kind of interesting and it works in explaining why they have a central weakness.Action and CinematographyAs an action sci-fi film, Edge of Tomorrow is pretty much expected to at least entertain visually, and it does for the most part.The exoskeleton like suits the soldiers wear in combat are pretty cool and offer an extra element to the battle sequences. Mimics are impressively animated, moving smoothly and viciously during battle.The special effects are what you would expect from this kind of film. There is nothing revolutionary or mind blowing to see here but it works just fine for the film. Action sequences are well choreographed and thankfully don't look like they were shot by a cameraman on Ritalin.The most impressive aspects of the cinematography come when Cage repeats the day. As mentioned before, the filmmakers did an excellent job avoiding being repetitive in a film were repetition is expected and part of the reason why this worked was clever cinematography.
The action is never boring in Edge of Tomorrow.The action is never boring in Edge of Tomorrow.The repeated scenes were quick cut and linked together seamlessly. Despite going by so quickly, I never felt like I missed any important detail during these scenes. The cameras always knew what to focus on and when, ensuring the audience never feels distracted or lost.The filmmakers also managed to keep all the action fresh by finding unique and inventive ways to kill the cast. While I normally don't make light of death, the time-loop aspect of the film really worked in making death feel not so terrible. The many deaths experienced by the cast range from shocking to quite honestly flat-out hilarious. Maybe I would have felt differently if they didn't all come back to life within minutes.ConclusionTo put it lightly, Edge of Tomorrow completely destroyed my low expectations. This film surprised me on many levels, particularly with how funny and well thought out it was and Tom Cruise playing such an atypical role. Cruise was fantastic and Emily Blunt equally impressed with her strong female lead, even if she was a bit undersold. The final act stumbles a good amount, but the rest of the film is so well executed. Action sci-fi fans or those simply looking for something unique and creative will no doubt enjoy Edge of Tomorrow."

In this instance, having opted again to make up my own mind, I thoroughly enjoyed the film not because it had the likes of Jonas Armstrong (from uk Robin Hood tv show) Emily Blunt and, of course the infamous Nicholas Cage - had you there mc'observe and become a tad persnickety too much lol and a lead role, of course, being Tom Holland? ...Ok ok get on with it - the unmistakable Tom Cruise all of whom who I recall enjoying watching see their acting ability come to life on screen and usually results in my appreciation for their work along with all involved in creating shows and films as without their skill set I'd find, during this worldwide pandemic less interesting options in which to escape from reality.I don't wish to break down the pros and cons, nor give any spoilers... I just want to say, IMO, that whatever your view of people's reviews, it's down to choice and for me, for reasons mentioned, I personally found I was entranced throughout the film so would say give it a gander and make up your own mind.Btw wasn't aware this film was released a few years back and the fact it had escaped my attention until it was recommended via online streaming based around my previous viewing habits of late, indicates my mind, being as some reviewers perceive people who enjoy sci-fi to be, little more than a numpty was perhaps elsewhere at the time of the films release so I for one can't say because it had to certain actors in play it made the film more appealing. It's the whole shebang that brings a film or a show to my attention and of the 400 or so films, shows I've rated on IMDb, it's one of a small number I set aside time to prove a personal review alongside the ascribed rating I chose to give the film.Well done for all those involved in this industry for bringing this film to one numpty viewers screen. It was and is always appreciated as you all work hard in your jobs be it on screen or behind the scenes and during this worldwide pandemic sci-fi numpties like me as some reviewers might describe us, very much appreciate the opportunity to escape for a brief period through entertainment that makes the experience enjoyable. Keep well, stay healthy and keep safe and thanks again for making films and shows like this happen."

The director knows how to do action, and seems to have an obsession with jumping and time traveling movies. This movie is not your groundhog day kind of timeloop movie.

Writers:Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay by), Jez Butterworth
Stars:Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill PaxtonDoug Liman (director) and his editor makes the learning process funny, engaging, yet they never forget to show the audience how horrible war really is--aliens or not . The action scenes are fast paced and blistering - the Mimics are an unstoppable force of sci-fi cinema and the beach battles are brilliantly rendered .Tom Cruise is excellent in the role - it is refreshing to see him as a smug pathetic coward who grows into an action hero. I have to hand it to Cruise he is a talented actor and stunt man.Stunning Emily Blunt matches Cruise every step of the way as his trainer and love interest. Blunt who clearly spent a lot of time in the gym whilst preparing for her character of battle hardened soldier Rita, nicknamed Full Metal B***h. She is truly impressive in this film. And who doesn't enjoy a dose of Bill Paxton? ! The rest of the cast is excellent, the music rocks. Must say the special effects are out standing and quite effective.Edge of Tomorrow, chocked full of action, explosions, aliens weapons , it is entirely refreshing to see a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that isn't a sequel, re-boot or comic book adaption. Great popcorn cinema, really enjoyed this one !"

" Film. Edit. Repeat. Edit. Repeat. Edit. Repeat.
",0.0,0.8613,2020-08-20 00:00:00,4,"'Edge of Tomorrow' inflicts a dreary repetitiveness of massively cut, re-cut and cut again film material which fails to coagulate into a worthwhile whole.There is a reasonable performance from Tom Cruise but nobody else has a character to portray so all the other actors struggle to provide any performance at all.A bit of physical comedy in the middle act is a welcome addition to the film and here is where I most enjoyed Cruise's performance because he is a natural physical performer. Overall the hints of comedy in Cruise's characters predicament, most notably his physical demises, is the only real strength that 'Edge of Tomorrow' possesses as a stimulating action and drama.Unfortunately the plot and the antagonists are all even more laughable than the physical comedy routines.Believability in the story and in characters and in the scenarios and situations depicted in each scene is impossible and this utter lack of suspension of disbelief renders things undramatic. Apart that is for Tom Cruise's physical performance and his lead actor charisma which just about, only barely, but just about, carry this mess to its silly conclusion.I rate 4/10 and I give a very big recommendation to Tom Cruise fans plus a mild thumbs up for alien invasion nerds. For everyone else just expect a blast of nonsense and 'Edge of Tomorrow' is passable pap as sci fi nonsense."

Tom Cruise does as Tom Cruise does in terms of playing a great character who is stuck in a time loop. Great action with Blunt and Cruise fighting the Mimics on the beach over and over again. The writing is excellent in terms of providing a unique concept- kinda like a Sci-fi Ground Hog's Day but better.
Action, Comedy and romance. How can you not love a story like this? The supporting actors are the best as well. Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are the two biggest names but all the soldiers in Cage's J squad are so funny and believable. And my God, Charlotte Riley is unrecognizable with her southern accent and vulgar mouth! I love this movie! I wish there was a sequel but maybe it's best we keep it to one fantastic movie!

The main characters are well acted as are the support, there is some intentional humour even during the brutal action sequences. I was worried the time loop narrative would get repetitive and boring but story moved along quickly enough to keep me interested
The sets and production values are AAA blockbuster standard but are let down slightly by the predictable CGI monsters moving at lightening speed that all these types of movies seem to have.All in all 8 stars from me."
" Clever, funny and absolutely thrilling SciFi blockbuster
",0.9254,0.9991,2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie is FANTASTIC!!. Just think of this. A sci-fi action movie, that is set in a dystopian future, where high octane mechanical sorta aliens invade earth, that involves time travel, that has Tom cruise fighting away in a metal exoskeleton suit...i mean what more could you want! Now for those who think this might just be another typical bleak SciFi plot like 'oblivion'or 'battle L.A' it really isn't. This is such a fresh take on the same genre.The trailer to this movie really underplays it which in my opinion is a good thing so as to not give audience false hopes. This is not just an action movie but is just as humourous as ""groundhog day"". The scenes were taken in such a engaging manner. As there are repeated sequences in the movie it could quite easily have become monotonous but they have managed to take it in such an awesome and fresh manner that always keeps us engaged.The plot of edge of tomorrow is based of a Manga. The action sequences are mind-blowing. There's no shaky cam or jump cuts which i absolutely hate in action movies. The CGI was also pretty darn cool and all the stunts were well choreographed. The entire battle on the beach was one of the best I've seen in movies ever! The story is really well paced and does not feel rushed or filled with convinient plot devices . There's a perfect blend of action and humour and none of the humour feels forced and almost all of them land. This movie is also very smart. By that i mean it doesn't treat you like a kid, its very smart and entertaining and really fun. It really surprises you, i really miss the feeling when u watch a really fresh plot and you have absolutely no idea where the movie is headed, and the they really stuck the landing, the third act of the movie was thrilling jaw-dropping and absolutely insane!As for Tom Cruise he was my favourite part of the movie and this is by far my favourite role of his in recent times. Its not his usual kind of role and it's something very refreshing to see and Tom cruise absolutely nails this. Every aspect of his character in this movie is perfect. He's smart funny and character that audience will love to ride along with in this movie. He also does most of the stunts himself which makes all the action sequences all the more realistic... this again is why i always feels an actor that does most of the stunts himself without stunt doubles is always whats best for an action movieEmily blunt is just BADASS here. She isn't just a sidekick or someone that gets shadowed by the lead actor.Overall Edge of Tomorrow is everything i love in a SciFi action movie. It's clever funny thrilling entertaining with really great cast and special effects. I really wish a lot of action movies nowadays would take a leaf outta this one. Really look forward to more of Doug Liman's work. You don't wanna miss this movie trust me"

What a great damn movie. I really hope the sequel comes soon. It makes us think in a groundhog way if the world was about to end and we had to step up as a nobody maybe even a lazy bum and we were forced to make something out of ourselves or have the whole world destroyed what a burden we would have to take on ourselves. I cant emphasize enough how much i love this one."
" Well-Done Movie With The Worst Title Ever

No, this movie/book is not based on ""Groundhog Day"", it's obviously inspired by computer games where you save your character in case it gets killed. Then you can start over at the save point but have an idea of what to expect.The title of this movie is so vague and uninspired they added ""Live Die Repeat"" to the disc release. Too bad they didn't think of that sooner. The words ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" conjures up images of...uh, nothing. The book title isn't much better, but at least it sticks in the brain.In the book, Tom Cruise's character is an ordinary grunt. But superstar Tom Cruise can't play an ordinary grunt, so they make him a higher rank busted down to ordinary grunt.The action is superb, but the whip-fizzy camera work makes it hard to see what's going on. It's a thing with current movies which I find annoying.That said, it's a good movie and not a sequel or comic book. Kudos to the studio for giving us something challenging and original. Except for the title."

" Light hearted sci fi actioner
",0.0,-0.4702,2020-06-20 00:00:00,7,"What if Groundhog Day was set during a war and dying caused the reset? This is the basic premise of Edge of Tomorrow, which sees Tom Cruise's William Cole being hurled to the frontline of a war against aliens that he wants no part of. Thing is, after an incident on the battlefield he is set to repeat the day over and over again, and over time he gradually learns how to be the soldier the battle needs.I liked EoT. It doesn't take itself too seriously, with Cole becoming victim to some amusing deaths as he learns the day. The Aliens look menacing enough, despite just being a mess of metallic tentacles, and seeing how Cole uses the repeating day to enhance his skills and learn the battle is intreguing. The action is solid and for the most part is well shot, although the final act seems to introduce a tone change, with quick cutaways and excessive darkness that make it difficult to see what's happening. Overall a great watch, but its probsbly not going to get into anyones top films of all time list."

I liked the plot, enjoyed the development and the work of Tom Cruise. And I usually hate it. I find him boring, just being he talking the lines, but not acting. I never forget that he is he.
By the way, this film is considered a box office failure, and I guess it was about timing. Only a few months after a very similar film in the outside, but far inferior quality. That one was Oblivion. Boring to dead. I just thought it was more or less the same.
Something similar happened with Cruise and MI:2. It was just awful, and didn't wanted to go back to the cinema to see MI:3, but it was amazing and entertaining. I guess s lot of people saw it at home, and that was the key for the success of the next one.
I just can recommend this film. And the work of Cruise is ok. The work of Emily Blunt is amazing."
" Genius
",0.0,0.9768,2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the amazing movies i have ever seen.
To the people who may not understand the ending.. Here u go ✌
In the first I'm really so tired of hearing everyone complaining about the ending. It isn't confusing at all, and you don't need a diagram with different colors representing different planes of existence, or other crap. I've heard people mention Omega blood being more potent so Cage jumps back further. I've heard people saying ridiculousness about them existing in different times or something. I've even heard people saying it was all a dream that Cage had while he was in the helicopter. There are many other ideas out there, and I disagree with all of them. Yes, I even disagree that the studio changed the ending from the books ending so they can make sequels, or just quickly finished it without thought. This angers me the most. I LOVED this movie, and after I watched it last night I spent the whole drive home explaining the ending to my wife and she finally gets it....SO here it goes, for your reading pleasure:There are 2 things that you need to understand before I write this:
#1. THIS IS WHY EVERYONE IS CONFUSED WITH THE ENDING...When a person is tased they are not unconscious for 24 hours...They are only unconscious for 2-3 hours at best. REMEMBER THIS, it's common sense!!!
#2. When an Alpha/Omega is killed and their blood is transferred to a human that Alpha/Omega ceases to exist because the human takes that beings place. This is why the Alpha that Cage killed never returns to the battlefield, AND why the Omega never returns...But I'll get to that later. Cage is now that Alpha and when he dies the Omega resets time 24 hours (1 day) FROM WHEN THE ALPHA WAS ORIGINALLY KILLED.I will now give you a timeline of events. This will make it much easier for everyone to understand. Please note that exact times are not mentioned in the movie, so I will be giving the times listed:
7:00AM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up in the helicopter on the way to meet the General
8:00AM (Day 1) - Cage is tased and labeled a deserter following his meeting with the General
10:00AM (Day 1) - Cage is awoken on the base by being kicked and called a maggot (PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS IS STILL THE SAME DAY)
9:00AM (Day 2) - THIS IS THE NEXT DAY. Cage is dropped from the plane and lands on the beach
9:05AM (Day 2) - Cage stated ""I die within 5 minutes of landing on that beach"" so this is when he kills the Alpha, and dies in the processNow every time Cage dies time is reset 24 hours FROM WHEN THE ALPHA ORIGINALLY DIED. This is why when he dies during PT by being ran over he is reset to 9:05AM (DAY 1) AND when he dies much later at the German Dam due to drowning himself he is still reset to 9:05AM (DAY 1). Also notice that 9:05AM is while he is unconscious due to being tased, and rather than the movie showing us Cage sleeping for 55 minutes they just skip to where he is awoken by being kicked and called a maggot.Now I will explain the ending for all of you:
10:00AM (DAY 1) - Cage is awoken on the base by being kicked and called a maggot
2:00PM (Day 1) - Cage and Rita meet with the General and get the device that Cage shoves into his leg
5:00PM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up after receiving a blood transfusion and losing his ability to reset time
10:00PM (DAY 1) - Cage and Rita convince J-Squad to help them
6:00AM (DAY 2) - Cage kills the Omega, and all of the Mimics die along with it. The Omega's blood is transferred to him and he becomes the Omega, resetting time 24 hours because the Alphas died
6:00AM (DAY 1) - Cage is now sleeping on the helicopter but just like before, rather than the movie show us 1 hour of him sleeping they just skip to where he wakes up on the helicopter. NOTE that at this time the Omega ceases to exist because its blood was transferred to Cage
7:00AM (Day 1) - Cage wakes up. When the helicopter lands he realizes everything has been reset and his friends are all alive once again. Instead of meeting with the General at 8:00AM he sees on the television that the General no longer requires his assistance because all of the Mimics are being easily handled. The ""Disturbance"" that the General is referring to that happened under the Louvre in Paris is the Omega ceasing to exist because Cage now has his blood.Once you understand that the end is NOT resetting time 2 days, and it's actually only resetting it a few hours prior to when it was previously resetting, AND when Cage resets the Alpha/Omega that he got his ability from ceases to exist it's pretty easy to wrap your head around everything.They can now easily do a sequel (Cage is the Omega/There is more than one Omega/Another asteroid brings more aliens/Whatever), or easily not do a sequel (They live happily ever after)"

It certainly isn't terrible but it also doesn't distinguish itself from all the millions of other action movies out there in my eyes .

",0.6369,0.9001,2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie continues with confusing scenes for about half an hour along with a sarcastic behaviour of Tom Cruise as he is also same confused as the viewers, but the unfolding of mystery with the entry of Emily Blunt drives the story into an entertaining plot where the whole theme is defined..
The rappot affinity between the two lead artist is a lot admirable.. The story encounters a great twist after the interval when Tom loses the power to reset the day and it becomes a kind of last attempt to do or die..
Overall it's an excellent movie and deserves a ten from my end"
" A Summer Blockbuster Masterpiece From 2014
",0.8402,0.9998,2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"Edge of Tomorrow is a prime example of an action film that does not need the audience to turn their brains off to enjoy the action. It tells the story of Major William Cage, who gains the ability to reset the day after getting some of the omega's blood. This movie is like a sci-fi twist on Groundhog Day, but instead of the main character just sleeping and waking up to the same day, Cage goes back to the same day every time he is killed. The premise for the movie is awesome and the writers execute this idea perfectly. Every time Cage wakes up, he gains new knowledge about the invasion and he reacts differently to the process of being recruited every single time. The same scene and lines of dialogue play again and again but it feels fresh every single time because of the way Cage reacts. This also helps him improve in combat. Every time he dies (most of the time actually), Cage gets a little further and slowly figured out the enemy's strategies. The plot progression feels organic and intense every time Cage seems to get closer to figuring out what to do. It feels like solving a puzzle. One thing that makes the script stand out is the gut-busting humor. This movie has made me laugh more than pretty much any comedy movie I have ever watched. It takes the ridiculous premise of the film to the max and does a great job with dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, it is some of the sharpest I have ever heard in a film. It kind of gives the feeling that everyone that Cage interacts with is an NPC of a video game. In fact, that is kind of what I get the feeling that the movie was going for: Poking fun of the fact that this could be a game. The other characters repeat their lines and Cage interacts with them differently each time. There is even an excellent montage where Cage and Vrataski plan how to get to the Omega and destroy it and every time they die, they create a new step for the next attempt. This could have been a monotonous experience that could make it feel more like a game more than a movie, but director Doug Liman and the writers make it to where it is fresh and exciting to watch. The world-building is terrific as well. The futuristic world looks cool but apocalyptic, the suits are interesting, and the ability to reset the day as well as losing the ability is well realized. There is a sense of dread throughout. This feels like a genuine apocalypse and it is hard to predict how it will end, nor would I want it to end. The tone is perfect. For the most part, it takes itself humorously, but it is also not overly cartoonish. It knows when it is time to take itself seriously when the plot gets progressively more intense. The climax gets some criticism, but it is intense because after Cage loses his power, he cannot die again or else the mission fails and he and everyone else are dead for good. The tonal change is earned. The story hooks you in with its great premise and it delivers in just about every way.The characters and performances are also phenomenal. Tom Cruise plays William Cage who is without a doubt, one of the most developed characters in a blockbuster film. He starts off as a coward who tries to escape the war in any way possible and has no idea how to even use the suit, which is called the ExoSuit, properly. Each time he wakes up, he reacts differently and gains more knowledge about fighting the mimics. However, he not invincible in the slightest due to the fact of dying throughout the film, so this movie does away with invincible hero cliché. It takes him a while to thrive in combat and he is more of strategic fighter than one who uses brute strength. Even when he gets better, he is still not invincible because the mimics are strong, fast and smart. They can kill the protagonists within seconds. His character has a fantastic arc and it is boosted by an outstanding performance by Tom Cruise. He shows so much range with this character and his reactions to his new ability and each reset are perfect. His freak outs are hilarious and relatable. What makes this performance work so well though is the fact that Cruise sells his role as a coward who is not good at combat at all. He starts out incompetent at combat and Cruise does a great job showing how his character needs training to stop the invasion. Rita Vrataski is just as great of a character. She is one of the most badass women in an action film of last decade. She trains Cage to improve in combat and she kicks plenty of ass in the role. One thing that I noticed this time that I never noticed beforehand is why her character was so prominent in this world. It dawned on me that her character, having the same ability as Cage at one point, and she improved her skills each time she died and she figured out some of the enemy's weaknesses before she lost it. It is a great detail that shows why she is so cold towards the people she interacts. Oh, and Emily Blunt's performance as Vrataski is perfect. She has such a commanding presence every time she is on screen. Blunt's performance shows that Vrataski is not someone you want to mess with. Cruise and Blunt also share great chemistry as their characters have perfect interactions with each other. The best part, they both help each other out and contribute equally to the plot. Vrataski trains Cage while he informs her of all the moves that the mimics will make and what they both need to do take out the Omega. They make a fantastic team. These two protagonists are awesome and well-developed. The side characters are great too. The J-squad is made up of funny soldiers who seem to not take the invasion as seriously as they should, but they are fun to be around. Sergeant Farrell played by Bill Paxton is one of the funniest side characters out there. Paxton delivers his lines perfectly he got so many laughs out of me. Even the man who walks up to Cage to say, ""ON YOUR FEET MAGGOT!"" is memorable. That is how good the characters are in this film.But as a blockbuster film, does it deliver on the spectacle? Hell yes! The set designs are terrific as they are creative with the battleground and the training rooms being the standouts. The scope of the war is grand as it feels like an apocalypse with little hope. What I adore about this movie visually is the design of the aliens or mimics. They look so creepy, but they do not look like stereotypical aliens at all. They are these octopus-like creatures that move very quickly and their abilities are menacing. They are terrifying because they kill the protagonist multiple times and they pose a real threat. The effects on the creatures just look so good as do the designs of ExoSuits and the weapons inside the suits. I wonder how it would feel wearing the suit to be honest and if they are practical or not. Now we come to the action. This movie is fast-paced and filled to the brim with action and every bit of it looks glorious. There is not a single frame of action in this film that looks bad. It is done with more frenetic camera work, but it works perfectly and the action is just so fun to watch. One thing that makes the action so fun to watch is seeing Cage learn from his mistakes each time and improving. Even though the we see the characters on the battlefield multiple times, no sequence ever feels the same. Also, it is established that these creatures can kill easily so it makes it a lot harder for Cage and Vrataski to defeat them and it becomes just a bit more satisfying when they reach their goal. In the climax, the intensity ramps up because Cage can no longer reset the day and knowing how the aliens can kill them, it is stressful to watch them get to the hideout and seeing the mimics come closer and closer to them, destroying their ship, taking out their crew and trying to kill them before they reach the Omega. It is intense as hell. It may not look as flashy as other blockbusters, but it shows that they do not need to be flashy to provide beautiful visuals and exhilarating set pieces. There is not a dull moment in these action scenes, or really, in this film for that matter. I still remember how much fun I have watching the action unfold in the theater, especially when they first hit the beach. The cinematography is gorgeous in the film. There are some stunning shots in this film and it helps make the action in the movie look great. Even when the lighting in the film gets a bit thin, there were some spectacular shots near the end of the movie. The soundtrack is the only thing that I think is a nitpick I have with production.We have amazing fleshed-out characters, terrific performances, a beautifully written story, stunning visual effects and awesome action scenes that are both entertaining and nail-biting. What more could you ask here? Edge of Tomorrow is an action blockbuster masterpiece. Yes, it might not be the deepest film, but it knows exactly what it is, and it does it perfectly. Every time I watch this film, I find more and more things to love about and more details I did not catch beforehand. Even the climax which gets criticized, I found a lot more intense on rewatch because the stakes rise in the third act. There is not a single movie that I had more fun with or that I grow to love more each watch than Edge of Tomorrow, and it has been that way since I saw it in theaters nearly six years ago. Edge of Tomorrow is not only easily my favorite film of the last decade and it is also my favorite action film of all time.This movie makes up the quickest hour and 53 minutes of my life, especially the first time that I saw it."

The rhythm of the film is particularly well grasped, repeated time node, similar segments, but will not make people feel boring. Male owners never willing to go to the battlefield of the civilian staff, over and over again in the death of the training of powerful skills to win, laugh and tears can not help. The woman refused to open her heart because she saw the loved one die three hundred times, and the male owner faced the same dilemma, knowing that some things were futile but still hard to do, the cabin coffee scene most let people feel the warmth and fate helpless, victory and emotion are especially difficult and should be treasured. Over and over again and a little bit of breakthrough ending, the whole film is always the game of the brave, there is no fate of welding death, only those who refuse to work hard."

There is some fun in this movie which can enjoyed by only some people while other people consider it as a routine ""Groundhug Day"" movie.
This movie simply based on The loser becoming the Savior in odd way and it was fun to watch. I enjoyed it and i definitely see it whenever i feel like depressed.

However, after giving this film a chance, I'm glad I saw it. While it felt a bit redundant at times (But I guess that's the point) and started off a bit slow, by the end I was enchanted. This is one movie Hollywood should NOT make a sequel to because this movie would be instantly tainted. This is not your typical sci-fi movie and is actually quite original. It's interesting to see how just one choice can cause a different outcome then a different choice. My one complaint was it wrapped everything up vaguely and too quickly. It feels like there's no ending. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not to keep the main idea of the movie but it felt rushed to me. I did enjoy the strategy concept of this film, and how it felt like it was poking fun at regenerating every time you die in a video game and have to watch the same cutscene every time. I'm pretty sure this was unintentional, but it was genius. I enjoyed this film and it's quite a shame it's considered a box-office flop.

The time travel in this movie is so messed up it creates more questions and continuity errors than it can resolve.I thought the special effects were good and I thought that the over all direction of the movie was good, but the time travel thing didn't work for me.When the main plot of the movie has continuity errors, and this one has it is spades, I no longer like the movie. I dislike it because the illusion has been broken and I realize that I'm back in my seat watching a movie.I want to be submerged in to a juicy plot which will make me forget reality for 90 minutes.

" Surprisingly good, way underrated
",0.6249,0.3972,2020-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Tom Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' ""Alphas"" but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless time loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the ""Angel of Verdun"", a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.Overall, the film is surprisingly good. I didnt expect much from it but it resulted in a very interesting sci fi action flick. The use of time loop in this movie is the best i've ever seen in a film"

The good thing about this film is it doesn't show you the many constant loops but through the way the story works you know he has done it many times over and over again. I love the pause moments when the day what now, to him respond I don't know never got this far. There is a certain amount of light comedy moments that will give you small giggles.

They take that idea off into an intriguing direction when our soldier and a second who'd had the same experience edge closer and closer to turning the tide of the war with each relived day.You will get bogged down in a good amount of CGI super-action, but there's apparently no other way to make a film like this at the present time."

The film follows an incredible character arc from Tom Cruise with a creative concept for an alien enemy. The whole concept of being able to die over and over again and get better every time is an original concept and is put to great use in the film, it's is very satisfying to watch Cruise's coward character continue to improve throughout the length of the film aswell as Emily Blunt's character aswell.It's very well directed with some electrifying sequences of action with some pretty impressive and well designed weapons.

",0.0,0.9258,2019-11-20 00:00:00,8,At first glance this seems like just another Tom Cruise movie your typical action movie with a few stunts and Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise but surprisingly it goes beyond that and exceeds expectations with an interesting storyline great action scenes and likable characters you feel invested in this is a surprisingly good movie.The storyline follows Lt. Col. William Cage (Tom Cruise) a public relations officer for the United Defence Force an army made up of different nations come together as one force to fight alien invaders known as mimics who came to via an asteroid crash landing on earth the mimics have taken most of continental Europe and are now heading for England Cage goes on TV and inspires people to join the army and help push back the mimics in a final push but after doing so is told he will be put on the front line aswell with no combat experience or courage Cage refuses and is made a deserter having his rank stripped and put on the front line of the attack when on the Battlefield he is quickly killed by a mimic that he kills by blowing them both up but the blood of this special mimic fuses with his melting his body and Cage wakes up at the start of the previous day as a deserter in the army barracks before the attack he tries to warn everyone but is dismissed as being crazy but when on the Battlefield he knows what will happen and begins to learn how to fight the mimics after saving one of the elite force fighters Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) he discovers he is not the first to obtain this power and with it he must learn how to fight and become a soldier and use his new found power to find the hive mind that controls the mimics and kill it to destroy them all armed with the ability to reset time he learns to fight and find the head mimic with only one condition if things go wrong he must reset the day over again by dieing anyway possible.Cruise and Blunt work well together and have great on screen chemistry the camera work and CGI looks great with real stunts and thrown in and despite the movie being a serious science fiction action movie it does have some comedic elements that are genuinely funny creative and smart.If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend giving it a watch its basically a science fiction groundhog day worth watching if you enjoy action movies and science fiction.

The ending makes no sense unfortunately.The only way this film can finish with the enemy dead forever is if no one resets the day. Unfortunately the blood thing happens again for Cage after killing the Omega, he wakes up even earlier than before, and at that time, the enemy is not yet dead again.This is unless killing the Omega has some special meaning and effect not explained in the film."
" Groundhog D-Day
",0.0,0.9936,2019-10-15 00:00:00,7,"For a film so on-the-nose featuring a modern day Normandy Invasion against MATRIX-like robot squid aliens who have taken over central Europe, this film works surprisingly well due to its fun hard scifi premise of reliving a time period over and over again until getting things ""right"". It's basically a send-up of the strange reality of video games, where the key to winning is not so much based on skill, but on memorization after hours and hours of trial and error. Ever seen an amazing speed-run of Super Mario or Battletoads online and wondered what it took to get there? This movie answers your questions, depicting it with a semi-plausible real-world scenario.The editor for the film certainly gave life to a concept that could easily become tiring. In fact, I would say this has to be one of the better-edited films I've seen in years. Things move along briskly and snappily and it was difficult to look away up until the climax of the film which unfortunately gets a little formulaic and stretchy to make things ultimately satisfying.Emily Blunt feels miscast as some battle-hardened veteran with perfect makeup, hair, and nary a scar from all her hand-to-hand combat. Sure the film would have been more realistic to have someone like Sam Elliot in her part as a shepherding mentor character, but wouldn't have the eye candy, and let's not kid ourselves there.Cruise does a good job playing a fish-out-of-water everyman type hero, but he's starting to get a little old to play this sort of character believably in such an action-heavy film. Action-wise, there are plenty of amazing stunts largely buried under a heavy torrent of VFX and CGI but thankfully not as obnoxiously as we've come to expect in films such as this."

" A great...awesome live.die.repeat movie..
",0.0,0.2256,2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,One of best movie of Tom Cruise. I started to watch all Tom Cruise's movies by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I have never thrilled by any film by this far but Edge of Tomorrow.
" Edge of boredom
",-0.3182,-0.9956,2019-10-01 00:00:00,1,"I normally like action sci-fi movies, even when they make very little sense, but I absolutely hated everything about this. Very few movies these days, if any, manage to have a completely likeable cast, but it seems there's no shortage of movies where you end up hating every character in it, so much so that you don't care what anybody does, what they say or whether they live or die.In a nutshell, Tom Cruise is part of a media relations team covering the war in Europe against squid like aliens called mimics. He's not a combat soldier and when he's ordered to go along as correspondent to cover the allied retaliation invasion, he refuses. He tries to blackmail the general in charge of the whole operation, is arrested, demoted to private and sent in as an army grunt. The operation is a dismal failure, Cruise is killed by an alpha mimic and gains the ability to reset time where he ends up living the same day over and over, apparently getting a little better each time until he's a highly skilled combat veteran trying different tactics to win a war, no one seems capable of winning. Sounds good, but I can assure you it's not. It's tedious, annoying, boring and the whole movie is just one huge plot hole from start to finish. If I'm going to watch a Groundhog Day style of movie, where so many scenes are repeated, the least you can do is make it interesting. If I'm sitting there wondering when it's going to end, then it fails on all counts.If Major Tom Cruise was the media face of the war why doesn't anyone seem to recognise him? Why is a U.S major transferred under orders to be taking orders from a U.K general? (seemingly the ONLY general in charge of the whole show). To avoid fighting at all, why doesn't the demoted Cruise demand a court martial in order to avoid combat for which he's not trained? If this is set in the near future, why is the army still using outdated WWII invasion tactics against a far superior force? If Cruise is killed on the same day or day after he's posted to his new team, even if this day is repeated for months, how does he manage to intimately learn everything about his team who instantly hate him anyway? Why does he insist on trying to be friends with Emily Blunt's character who also openly despises him and doesn't think twice about killing him in order to reset the timeline to start the day over from scratch? Why do they bother equipping an overwhelmed ground force with cumbersome mech suits, when you can just call in multiple air strikes or navy fired missiles from offshore before sending in humans at all? If any of this were even remotely possible, reliving a day of intense combat over and over, where everybody hates you and you repeatedly die horribly would literally send any person insane. Also at the end when the timeline has corrected itself and Private Cruise is back to being Major Cruise, no Sergeant, regardless of her accomplishments or decorations would greet a Major with ""who are you, what do you want""? Without so much as a salute.I can accept stretches in reality when the movie has been set up that way, but when a movie like this attempts to ground itself in reality by news broadcasts, interviews and clips of real people only to then completely deviate from all common sense or continuity, the distraction overwhelms enjoyment. I can't accept the reviews giving this 9s or 10s and tags of ""best sci-fi ever"" etc when there's just far too much stupidity in it. I don't expect too many thumbs up for this as there's a never ending love of mediocrity but if I could give this zero stars, I would."

Quite thrilling, however ridiculous it may sound at first...It starts out a bit silly, with Tom Cruise being portrayed as an INexperienced fighter. But after a somewhat weird start it builds up in suspense though. The story: Tom Cruise has to conquer an alien invasion. But other than in ""real Life"", this time Tom Cruise can repeat the same fight with these aliens over and over again and learn from earlier mistakes he made, just as in a computergame. He becomes a better fighter at every step of the way, but will he be able to conquer the aliens in the end?Any bad? Well, of course it is a cheap story, targetted at teenage gamers I guess. But the reason why I (as an adult) still award it with 8 stars is because of the great adrenalin rush it gave me. Many computer games might be silly, but they still can get me very excited. Edge of Tommorow has that same kind of quality. Definitely recommended for action fans."

The problem I have with the film is the ending. It feels very ""made for American audiences"". I won't spoil it, but it defies the films rules and logic just to put a happy twist on the proceedings.But, I love the rest of the film so much I chose to just not let that ruin the movie."

It's bizarre a little.The savage thing was that he had to start over when he was killed. There's no save point. So, the fortune hardly worked. He had to grasp the action petterns of the enemies and the others completely. You know, it's a basis of the video game!If you're tired of playing, you can get the rest.

" Edge of Your Seat
",0.0,-0.9423,2019-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Putting aside the fact people do not like Tom Cruise as an actor, this was a really good movie to watch. It is a Sci-Fi film about fighting extraterrestrial beings, but it deals with war on a deeper scale with Tom Cruise's character reliving the day over-and-over again!
Emily Blunt adds tremendous depth as a female co-lead to the movie taking on a different approach of being a solider. Tom Cruise gets closer to her reliving the day with her. However, seeing her KIA on the battle field takes a tremendous toll on him as a character.
What happens in the end? Recommend watching the movie to find out as this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next."

" Pretty good movie with some unnecessary flaws. Just don't watch the ending
",0.7269,0.9922,2019-07-31 00:00:00,8,"To be honest, i only expected a mediocre action movie going in, but i had to change my mind on that. Even with its flaws, it's still a very entertaining movie that i quite enjoyed.I certainly did not expect the movie to subvert some action movie tropes in the way it did, which is one of the main reasons i enjoyed this movie so much. In particular, how merciless war was being portrayed, that is something you don't see very often to this extent. The time loop mechanic certainly helped making that possible and was used well in that regard.However, towards the end the movie takes just about everything it did well, and simply throws it out of the window. The movie was perfectly fine without the female character (who, thanks to the time shenanigans, only knows the protagonist like less than a day) throwing herself at the protagonist. It was perfectly fine without forcing a happy ending, i thought the moment where the heroes were just dead was perfect and is was extremely disappointed to see they didn't just stop there.And the movie also just had to stop being sensible about how dangerous war is for some reason towards the end, and forget that surviving took the protagonist countless attempts and lots of training. Suddenly they can just handle ridiculously bad odds without second chances. It nullifies what the rest of the movie stood for and what made it interesting, and i honestly recommend simply skipping the ending. I wish i could forget it.Up until that point, it was thoroughly enjoyable though and i definitely recommend it, it's an action movie that stands out."
" A Surprisingly Entertaining Movie
",0.6249,0.9612,2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliche. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.First of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the ""full metal b****"" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.Going back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.The Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.The premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an ""Alpha"" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the ""ability"" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of ""hair"" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very ""us vs them"" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.You'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.8/10*This review is from 2015."
" Great: 9.0
",0.6249,0.9159,2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"This really shouldn't have happened. Edge of Tomorrow started out as All You Need is Kill, and the first anyone saw of it was a fairly ridiculous-looking shot of Tom Cruise running towards the camera with a giant explosion in the background. The director didn't inspire confidence either (Doug Liman's prior big-budget film was Jumper. The less said, the better), and the premise (Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers) seemed domed to fail from the beginning. But it didn't, and what we got instead is a funny, uncommonly intellignt sci fi-action film that tells an engrossing story while never taking itself too seriously. The time-loop concept is used extremely well, never repeating footage. It knows that we've gotten the gist already, and to only show what we need to see. It's the rare blockbuster that gives its audience's intelligence the credit it deserves."

" It covers familiar ground and is a bit gimmicky, but it still very much succeeds on its own merits
",0.8507,0.9712,2019-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Soldier Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to fight on the frontline (very much against his will) in a war against an alien race. Cage gets killed during the battle, but also discovers that he is able to reset the day every time he dies. Cage struggles to convince his fellow soldiers of what has happened to him and what he knows, but manages to find an ally in another soldier Rita (Emily Blunt). With their different skill sets they set to work in trying to defeat the alien race once and for all...Edge Of Tomorrow has clearly lifted its central concept from Groundhog Day and set it in a post apocalyptic era where humans are fighting aliens (which again is nothing new). Aside from the gimmicky nature of the plot, I think what makes the film work is mainly down to the way the story is constructed and how it all unfolds; at first we're in the same boat as Cage - confused about what is happening and searching for answers. It soon starts to become like a puzzle and each time Cage dies and resets the day we are gradually able to start piecing things together and more and more of the story starts to unravel and step by step Rita and Cage get closer to achieving their goal.One thing I did find interesting about this film was the way Cruise's character is written; usually when watching Cruise's films he usually has leading man status and generally plays characters with a degree of heroism. At the start of the film, he is something of a pacifist and is very much against violence (which is not something we're used to seeing from Cruise in a lot of his action films). Of course, he becomes skilled later in the film, but it was interesting to see Cruise play a character that had been written in such a manner. On the other hand, Emily Blunt's character is the opposite; tough as nails and rather no nonsense in approach - she remains this way throughout which was something of a blessing as I was worried that we might have had another 'sappy romance' on our hands.Edge Of Tomorrow is a good looking film with some neat special effects and director Doug Liman keeps everything tight and focused; naturally it's a rinse and repeat approach, but new developments to the story are realised on each repeated day so it never becomes dull (this was part of the reason that Groundhog Day worked as well). Out of the supporting cast then it's only Bill Paxton who's really given anything to do and he once again puts in a very strong performance.Despite the fact that this is Groundhog Day set against the backdrop of war with an alien race, Edge Of Tomorrow still manages to hold its own and is an entertaining film with a decent story and enough elements for it to be able to stand up to scrutiny on its own merits. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but an enjoyable film nonetheless."

SPOILERS
I was not a huge fan of the ending. At first I thought it made no sense that he was able to reset even farther back in time than all prior resets. And also that what happened to the Omega would still apply but the humans get reset back to life. After reading some stuff online I found out that the reason he was reset to an earlier time is because the final battle happened the night before the beach invasion from when he got his original powers and timeline. I am also okay with the possible explanation that when the Alpha dies the Omega resets, but when the Omega dies it stays dead while still giving off one last reset. I now understand it better and it makes sense for the most part but still not entirely. And it just seemed like a conveniently happy ending when I thought him sacrificing himself would have been an awesome ending and a good completion to his character arch.Here is something I read on screenrant that explains everything I am saying perfectly:""There is not one clear-cut explanation for how the final reset could start hours earlier and incorporate the destruction of the mimics, but leave every other variable unchanged. Time travel logic is always a can of worms, meaning that viewers should have no problem coming up with their own ways of explaining the ending. Still, based on the limited information within the film, the end result is a paradox - one that ultimately provides the audience with a (semi-)happy ending at the expense of a more straightforward story of sacrifice that fits within the previously established rules"""

Of course, and an excellent example of this is Edge of Tomorrow. A fantastic, interesting and original film full of fascinating moments with an exceptionally constructed structure; intelligent and intense, with incredible scenes to admire for the view and a sublime direction that complements every aspect of the film.A film that undoubtedly respects its audience; offering us extremely cool scenes without the need for overexposure or unnecessary and prolonged explanations about the plot, monstrosity enough clues and pieces to be able to assemble by ourselves the events that occur within it. Full of a complex but interesting plot that can be easy to follow if you pay a little attention.The film also has fantastic performances by the protagonists, both Cruise and Blunt form a synergistic and realistic duo, with excellent performances and a solid script that shows us the emotions and feelings of each of the characters through a narration both graphic and vocal. Finally, the film has incredible action. Simple, frenetic and original; with excellent special effects, surprising cinematography and a soundtrack that goes just hand in hand with the action and themes that occur in the film.An excellent action movie that manages to be catalogued as one of the best sci fi movies of the last years, having everything. From fascinating performances to an original, complete and interesting plot. A film that I totally recommended."

Marvellously this film avoids to ever become repetitive which is a remarkable achievement given the scale of the film in comparison to more smaller plotted 'loopers' such as Source Code or Happy Death Day which too are fantastic films. Anyway, Cruise is surprisingly charming as a lead for someone who personally struggles to really enjoy any of his work outside of Mission Impossible he carries the film well though one could argue it's fairly balanced if not more on Blunt's shoulders as a more significant fisher to the plot with the constant reminder at the start (or restart if you will) of the day that she's the 'Full Metal Bitch'. Impressive action that always seems to develop and a well handled plot which further condenses time to skip along and add a grandness to the nature of the plot without holding the hand of the audience lead to a brilliant film that honestly has so much rewatch value regardless of the cast that are relatively nobodies and are recognisable to a British audience who've consumed various cult TV programmes. A neat little Sci-fi outing thats well worth your time"
" One of the best movies of 2014
",0.6369,0.9819,2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Edge of Tomorrow is everything a sci-fi movie should be, explosive and inventive. The action wasn't just in huge quantity but of the highest quality too. Managing to avoid too many cliche's and creating something really interesting to accompany the slick action sequences. The plots formula is similar to that of Source Code but in very different circumstances. Pacing to this futuristic war zone is perfection and although it has unanswered questions on its wider background it focuses on the elements pivotal to the movies structure, enabling it to a success. Tom Cruise is proven in his role but his relationship with Emily Blunt is brilliant together with Edge of Tomorrows sharpness, energy and humour its one of the best movies of 2014 so far."

It has a great set up, a surprising twist in the first twenty minutes where you find he respawns his day over again! Great humour with the repetition and his try's and fails! Plenty of action and emotion as well.
The CGI in this, I think, is great not sure why people are trashing it, seen much worse in some current movies today!
I never get tired of watching this film, a brilliant sci fi, would recommend 100% to anyone who loves sci fi action!

After various failures and deaths, he is ""reborn"" at the point of joining the mission and this cycle is repeated with new knowledge.Using this other-worldly plot device is often fun and fascinating. It's almost like the philosophy behind reincarnation - that we have to repeat the life-death cycle until we've learned all lessons. Treating the live-die-repeat cycle with humour is also enjoyable.For an action film, the most enjoyment is expected to come from the film's conclusion and its build-up.

That is how William Cage (Tom Cruise) tries to triumph over an alien invasion after being splattered with the blood of an alien different from a bunch of alien invaders fighting with mankind. He is then trained by Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a well-known, battle hardened soldier who crosses paths with William Cage.From start till end, the pacing of the film does not drag in a way that exhausts it viewers due to overuse. Use of certain elements in a film (e.g. balancing the right amount of exposure of characters or conflicts in a plot) can give viewers a hard time to follow the story, especially with a ""restarting-the-events"" the MC experiences. However, in each restart the further the story goes, there has been a significant character or story development, otherwise, some shorter restarts are just for gags.Overall, it is a very thrilling action packed story with just the right pacing, progression, and development of its characters while they manage to find a solution to end the conflict and save the world."
" Pleasantly surprised
",0.6124,0.9861,2019-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Going into watching this movie, I'll be honest, I didn't expect much. I figured it was probably just some usual sci-fi movie with crappy effects and a lack of an actually interesting and full plot. The only thing that gave me hope was that Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were the stars of the movie. Soon enough, I realized I had seriously doubted this movie way more than I should have.First off, I love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise, and their acting in this was phenomenal. It was fun to see Cruise in a role where he was helpless and lost; out of place (in the beginning), while Blunt was the badass female who trained him and built him up. Speaking of Blunt, her character Rita was a truly incredible character in my opinion, and Blunt did an excellent job of portraying her.Now onto the plot: this is where I was initially worried when I began the movie. However, I found myself really enjoying the movie very soon in, after catching onto some things. It made me think, which I liked, but also wasn't so unclear that I couldn't figure anything out. I thought that the time loop idea was very interesting and unique for a sci-fi movie, and even though things kept repeating, I was never bored or felt like there wasn't enough happening. I loved the action in this movie, and also the more tender moments between Rita and Cage. Movies that can make you cry and make you sit on the edge of your seat in suspense always intrigue me, and that's what this movie did for me. I just didn't want it to end.Side notes: I've watched some behind the scenes footage of this movie, and either all or a majority of the action sequences that we see in the movie were filmed, not inserted using CGI, which is very impressive. But to me, not more impressive than the fact that Blunt and Cruise each did their own stunts. These actors are so amazing in my opinion.
The only reason that this movie is getting 9 and not 10 stars from me is that I felt towards the beginning of the movie, the whole time loop thing was being dragged out a bit too much, I wanted things to move a bit quicker.*These are simply my opinions. I respect anyone and everyone's opinions, even if I don't agree with them, and I ask that you do the same with my review and others. Thank you.*"
" Amazing film, in concept and in visual majesty; one of Cruise' best performances ever
",0.8402,-0.9189,2019-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Britain from America to chronicle and film the battles against an alien enemy, the Mimics, who have overtaken Europe. As England fears the huge, insect-like aliens will soon cross the Channel, they are preparing another D-Day invasion. Astonishingly, Cage has never been trained in battle, despite his rank, as he is an information specialist. Yet, the General in charge of the invasion expects Cage to lead soldiers on the field. He can't, he explains. Soon, the General orders Cage's arrest, the American is stripped down to the rank of private, and ordered to a squadron of paratroopers. The invasion is the next day and Cage, in an elaborate suit of armor he knows nothing about, will take part. The result is ghastly, Cage is overcome with fright and sees the fearsome aliens mow down one soldier after another. But, there's a twist. As Cage fires on an exceptionally large alien, called an Alpha, the human is covered in Alpha blood as they both die. In the next moment, Cage is back in time to the point of his discovering himself to be a private and hauled off to meet the squadron. Again. Along the way, he meets an exceptional soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt), who has destroyed many of the Mimics by herself. She explains why. IF you receive alien blood, even on the surface, you are part of Einstein's fourth dimension, time. Therefore, you now have the ability to ""loop back"" indefinitely and learn from each encounter on how to fight the Mimics and take them down. As Cage and Rita live, die, and repeat, will they be successful in freeing the Earth of these hideous Mimics? What a thrill ride this movie is! No, the concepts aren't totally original but borrowed and embellished very well and the visuals of the movie are majestic. How terrifyingly real are these aliens and how epic each battle is. Cruise has rarely been better, from scared civilian to strong fighter and Blunt is equally fine and regal. Even a casual sci-fi fan will be enthralled by this one!"

",0.8689,0.9864,2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an unique installment on the list of the Top Sci-Fi movies of all time. As every movie it consists of 4 stages. The First Act (Introduction, Preparation for the story), the Second Act (Action Scenes), the Third Act (Final Climax) and the Final Act (Resolution, Ending). The director, Doug Liman did a brilliant work with the First and Second act of this film. However, the Third Act is a bit different and not as climatic as I would wanted it to be. Moreover, I expected it to be a boring movie, beacause of the fact and we would be watching the same day over and over again. Thankfully, I was wrong. Every loop and repetition of this day was different than the others in an unique way. This made the movie very interesting to see how Doug Liman managed to acomplish this director-challenge. All in all it is an awesome movie with a brilliant plot and good actors. I hope there is a sequel, which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and I am sure, that Doug Liman will do so. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with clever characteristics in it. Every frame feels like a loop worth sitting in. Must see movie. However, be as always cautious, not to have very high expectations, in order not to ruin a good-movie."
" Ground Hog Day Sci Military Action Thriller
",0.1027,0.9513,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"10 March 2017. To describe this movie as a military action thriller as a version of the Ground Hog Day comedy is to underestimate the number of days this movie involves. In a way, it's also a coming of age movie, especially for Tom Cruise's character who must really suffer through the movie in a good movie way, almost to the point of humorous tedium. Mostly this is an action thriller as most military movie are along with the typical sci fi monster alien twist. After a slow build up, the pacing quickens and never let's go. The audience gets to observe the physical pain, the mental anguish of loss and sacrifice, even blind faith. Using the time twist, this movie takes its action in an exciting, different way even though it doesn't really break through as a totally different, brilliant creative innovation, it nevertheless brings forth the great use of existing movie formulas in an exciting, entertaining way."

" Stupid sci-fi
",-0.5267,-0.996,2018-12-24 00:00:00,2,"When I heard the title I thought it was a daytime soap opera, but that's hardly the point.The first problem is that they treat the ""time reset"" as an advantage when it is not. Imagine D-Day. Years of planning, hundreds of soldiers killed but the objective is achieved and an Allied foothold is taken. Then, just as the day ends, a single soldier is killed. He steps on a mine or is shot by a sniper and suddenly it's yesterday and they have to do it all over again. Maybe it will go better or maybe it will be a disaster. The point is they do not control it, not with Alphas roaming loose. They also have to know that the power can be transferred to a human, giving them the advantage.The real stupidity is in the writing. For example, despite being the only one with the power, Cruise manages to convince a platoon to follow him. So, the night before the battle (a battle that Cruise knows is a trap) they sit around talking about how they are going to get off that beach alive. But if Cruise knows it is a trap why are they going there at all? Why walk into a trap? In fact, why are they waiting at all? They've got a 12 hour head start. Why wait to step into a trap to desert? Why not start now and be halfway to the Omega before the battle starts?Another example is the helicopter. He knows they fail every time so why keep trying? Isn't the textbook definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result? I he knows it's a trap, why not swing a few miles north or a few miles east and try that? Why do the same thing over and over? It's just stupid.Of course, the whole ending is absurd. They kill the Omega and it's the day before, when the Omega is still alive. Everyone who died is alive and the aliens are defeated and no one knows why or how."

" Groundhog Day With Aliens. I'm sold!
",0.0,0.9983,2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"Edge of Tomorrow was a pleasant surprise for me going in. Of the big blockbuster movies coming out in the summer of 2014, Edge of Tomorrow was one of the ones I was looking forward to least, but I ended up really liking it. In fact, it is probably one of the better movies of the summer so far. They took an unoriginal premise and actually made it work. Tom Cruise does a great job. The action and effects were also very well-done.The story revolves around a man named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who is a Major in the American army. However, he is mostly a public speaker and is not used to combat. He is suddenly forced into this huge battle with an alien race which up until now have been unmatched by any military in the world. This was supposed be the deciding battle for the humans but it goes horribly. However, when Cage kills an alpha alien and dies he gains their ability. Now whenever he dies he repeats the same day before the big battle over and over again until he is able to destroy the aliens' power source. To do this he must get the help of a soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt).The film does many things amazingly. I like the way they handle rinse and repeat type of story. I have seen this many times so I was not expecting too much going in, but I thought it was handled well. I love how Cage is able to take everything he has experienced from his countless repeats and use it to his advantage, whether it comes to his combat skills, to him relating and reasoning with the rest of the cast. The film is also very funny in how Cage repeats everything. I love how he gets wasted countless times in battle or by Rita herself. I especially love the training sequence where he constantly gets seriously injured and Rita kills him and he has to start over. This film really does feel like a video game where when you die you start the mission again, except I am watching instead of playing.Tom Cruise does a great job in this. His character is the driving factor in this film. If not for him I would not like this film nearly as much as I do. I like how he starts out as a wimp in the beginning (which I am not used to seeing) and steadily grows more and more badass as the film progressed. Cruise has done many Sci-Fi films in the last few years like Oblivion. I like Oblivion a bit more than this, but this is still well-done. I also love Bill Paxton in this. I like his character and his performance is great. I have not seen Paxton in a major film in years so it was great to see him back.As I said before the action and special effects look nice. The design for the aliens is something I have not quite seen before. I also like their ability that they gave to Cage. I have seen better looking aliens but I think they look fine.I do have a couple issues though. Other than Cruise and Paxton's characters I did not find the rest of the cast to be that memorable. Rita is okay and Emily Blunt does a good job performance-wise. However, despite having some cool moments, I was just was not that invested in her. When her and Cage are having their romantic and dramatic moments I did not care. The other important characters are the people in Paxton's platoon. I do not remember any of these people. At first I thought this was going to be like Aliens where you have a group of very like able and badass marines, but that is not the case. They are boring and ultimately pretty irrelevant.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is an entertaining Sci-Fi movie that takes a premise we have seen many times and puts a relatively new spin on it. I think you should definitely check it out. Unfortunately, like with Oblivion, it seems that the film is not doing very well in the US which is a shame."

" A COWARD DIES A THOUSAND DEATHS
",-0.4588,0.25,2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,"The opening of the film is quick and disjointed. What we gather is that an alien has crashed on earth in a meteor and is taking over the planet. A D-Day type affront is planned and General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is assigning desk jockey Major Cage (Tom Cruise) to lead the charge. At this point we find out Cage is a coward and gets demoted to a private, placed in the front lines.Like a video game, when your character dies, you get to go back to your last save point, you play some more, level up, and try something else. Basically this is what Cruise does in his effort to save the planet in just one more movie. While he keeps going back in time, he comes across Rita (Emily Blunt) a been there done that type of fighter. Together they must find and kill the big brain bug, or something. Sort of like combining ""Starship Troopers"" with ""Groundhog's Day.""If you like Tom Crusie, you get to see enough of him. If you like watching him die, again, then this is your film too.

The movie was laced with perfect doses of wit and humour as well. Moreover, all the actors, led by Tom and Emily, did a fantastic job to say the least.

" An exciting, unique and character-focused science-fiction flick.
",0.4939,0.9468,2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"'Edge Of Tomorrow (2014)' didn't do all that well at the box office, prompting the distributors to try and push an alternate title for the Blu-Ray release ('Live. Die. Repeat.') in the hopes that consumers would mistake it for a new release and give it a go - though, this must've worked since a sequel (annoyingly titled 'Live. Die. Repeat. And Repeat.') is supposedly on the way, even if it's not always a good idea to force a follow-up to what should be a future classic. This fantastic sci-fi film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience throughout that mixes pulse-pounding, expertly choreographed, often large-scale yet always character-focused action with intriguing genre elements that create both a sense of mystery and an incredibly unique viewing experience on the whole, as the 'time-loop' conceit (which isn't just stolen from 'Groundhog Day (1993)') provides a constantly evolving but always consistent framework for the narrative to take place in; each iteration of our protagonist's journey feels like another step to solving a puzzle as opposed to anything even remotely repetitious. The only real flaw with the piece is its kind of cop-out, 'Hollywood' ending that makes sense only to a point and isn't quite in keeping with what we've seen before, but even this doesn't stop it from being one of the best entries in its genre. 8/10"

You would think the movie might get a little boring with Tom reliving the same day over and over, but it wasn't for me. The ending does fall a little bit short in my opinion, but it's still a solid movie. Like I said previously, Tom Cruise is pretty much the same character here as he is in movies like Mission Impossible, Knight and Day, Etc. But I honestly don't mind.

I got it on DVD today and I have to admit that this is one of the most creative and unique films of all time. The concept is fantastic; I had never seen or heard anything of this kind. It kept me engaged from beginning to the end and not for a moment did I take any break. EDGE OF TOMORROW is a riveting masterpiece. It's another powerful action movie with a great science fiction setting which made it extremely enjoyable. The best thing is it wasn't long. Doug Liman's films have always impressed me and this one is no exception. He avoids subplots and by sticking only to the main plot, makes sure the viewer doesn't even feel the urge to take a break. Tom Cruise...oh man! I've no words to say for him. He's my favorite Hollywood actor and in this film, you see him in his true, charming style. Be it the action or the story or even the moments which require him just to smile or chuckle, he delivers every bit of it. Emily Blunt gives a sharp performance even though it's technically Cruise whose presence takes the centre stage out of all. A special mention to the film's VFX and action. As it's an out-and-out science fiction action movie, it's filled with loads of nonstop action and high quality visual effects. That just made me wish I had seen this movie on the big screen. It's not dramatic or dark by any means. It is a very intriguing story which keeps you awake throughout. Its unpredictability makes you think about how it's all gonna end, but the script is so tight that the very next moment you're offered solid action and thrill, eventually making you stop thinking.I'd strongly recommend EDGE OF TOMORROW to anyone who likes movies in general. And if you're interested in SF/action movies, you're in for a highly enjoyable, memorable, exhilarating treat."

If you are familiar with Groundhog Day and Source Code, then add war and aliens and you get this movie. You have to be very, very careful with this as well. Basically, Tom Cruise is an inexperienced (yeah, that's a first) officer who is afraid of blood, and he gets thrust onto the front lines. It's supposed to be a great victory, even having the name Operation: Downfall. Instead, the Mimics set it up for the world to throw all their soldiers right into an ambush. Then Cruise ends up getting an Alpha's blood mixed in him, granting him its time-manipulating powers. It becomes his job to relive every day, and slowly learn how to defeat the enemies. He meets Emily Blunt, the only person that will believe his situation, and she trains him to be able to defeat the aliens. Since the whole movie has the same day, same scenarios repeated, it's crucial to show enough to the audience without it looking repetitive. And I think this video game-like movie succeeds tremendously.Hardly ever has an editor's job been more important or difficult. The result is very humorous at first at all of Cruise's deaths, but as he grows closer to Blunt and witnesses death every single day with little ability to make a significant impact, the dreading of having to do this again with no escape hits really hard.If you're unfamiliar with Tom Cruise films, I may shun you at first; but do not worry, for I will gradually show more and more of his films (and so many are quite good). It's much more understandable to not know of Emily Blunt. And that is a shame, for she is a talented actress in some great films like The Adjustment Bureau and Looper (okay, she's probably known most for The Devil Wears Prada). Sadly, outside of these characters, there's nothing to cheer over with the supporting cast. But the focus is on the 2 stars, and that's the way it should be.A cool addition to this sci-fi action flick is the exoskeletons worn by the soldiers. Resembling what was seen in Aliens, for the most part, the actors are actually doing stunts and wearing these. There's enough to figure out that it takes a couple of resets to be familiar with how to operate them.One scene I particularly remember in Groundhog Day is Bill Murray at the bar, and slowly he finds the right words to say to make the conversation work; similarly, Cruise suffers many deaths only to be more aware for the next shot where he gets past the obstacle. The pacing is quick, but it also settles down for pondering the dire situation at hand. It's a combination of emotions that I think works very well. All in all, it's just such a fun and smart film that I'm really pleased to see made right.In concludeIn conclusion, this is a good film.In conclusion, this is a film that blends a hearty amount of action, comedy, and drama. I look forward to seeing more films from both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt."
" It was almost great
",0.5868,0.9696,2018-05-21 00:00:00,8,"I thought it was a masterpiece until literally the last scene where I question why it would end that way. The scene before when I was certain it ended would have been a perfect ending and an equal to District 9 or the first two Terminators. I'm sure there's an alternate ending on dvd/blu ray even though the second to last sequence felt like an ending. Edge of Tomorrow is like a video game with intelligence. He dies, but learns how to defeat the enemy until the next location like when your character is on different levels of a video game. This is probably the best movie I've seen this year and certainly my favorite this summer! The story for Edge of Tomorrow sounds like a cross between Groundhog Day and Terminator. It's about a soldier that's thrown into this time loop where he dies and comes back battling robots every time. I would love to see it again and own this, but that final scene annoyed me."

The movie is clearly above your average unknown action movie, it has something special. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, a war and action, and it's based on a manga, this movie had all chances to be dumb as F but they somehow managed to make something pleasant to look at!
I can't judge this movie based on its source material since I've never read it, but as a standalone movie it holds up. Whether you like him or not, Tom Cruise is very convincing and Emily Blunt seems to be built for tough roles, she looks pretty badass. 
Plot is pretty cool for the first half of the movie, then it goes a bit downhill imo because the element or surprise is gone but still fun to look at."

This movie hits on every level, it's fast, witty, action packed, and presents depth in surprising places. If you don't have ADHD and can stay focused so you don't fall behind, and possess the ability to perceive without your hand being held and walked through a plot, you are most definitely going to like this movie.

This movie is almost like slightly lesser version of Minority Report with a really unique twist. you sort of go into the movie with so many questions, that you have to figure out based on the events in the movie.
Although there is some explaining as to his groundhog day-like day repeats, instead of just watching this character solve this confusing battlefront mystery, you are trying to follow it with him. 
I would say this movie focuses less on combat and more on this guys trying to figure out how he can stop this war using his unique borrowed power.

" ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""Groundhog Day""
",0.0,0.9971,2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Despite the presence of Tom Cruise, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a movie that flew somewhat under the radar back in the summer of 2014. Recouping only $100 million of its $170 million budget in domestic ticket sales, the movie proved to be a box office disappointment. However, it did perform better in foreign markets while also garnering a fair amount of praise from critics.The movie casts Cruise as Major William Cage, a PR officer with no combat experience who gets demoted to private for disobeying orders on the eve of a massive offensive against an alien force. Thrust into the midst of a heated battle, Cage predictably doesn't last very long but when he dies he immediately wakes up on the previous morning with a full memory of what he has experienced. This sets up the movie's 'time loop' premise, whereby Cage continually dies only to experience the same day over and over again, learning from his mistakes and becoming a hardened combat veteran along the way. This draws obvious comparisons to the comedy classic ""Groundhog Day"" but in this case the phenomenon is given a scientific explanation. As with ""Groundhog Day"", the premise is utilized cleverly in the repetition of scenes with variations, often to comic effect. There's plenty of action as well and even some dramatic weight at times. Overall, while the general concept may be somewhat familiar, the story (which was adapted from a Japanese light novel) is one that should satisfy both science fiction fans and general moviegoers alike.The cast is a pretty good one. Tom Cruise is well suited to his role and he receives excellent support from Emily Blunt, who plays a character that previously had the same condition as Cage. The supporting cast is mostly made up of relative unknowns who are nonetheless authentic. That being said, the supporting cast does include Brendan Gleeson & Bill Paxton, who are always welcome in any movie in which they appear.Director Doug Liman did a good job here, balancing explosive sci-fi spectacle with lighter moments and even a dash of drama. The special effects are well done in a way that supports the story first and foremost, without drawing excessive attention to themselves. Both visually & musically, the movie is well executed though not necessarily exceptional. Probably the best technical aspect of the film is the editing, which is especially important in a movie with an unconventional narrative like this.Overall, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a finely tuned action movie with a pair of first-rate performances and a clever, absorbing plot. The reasons for its relatively lukewarm reception are anyone's guess but I suspect that American audiences probably just didn't have much interest in seeing Tom Cruise in another sci-fi action movie (particularly after the previous year's similarly tepid response to ""Oblivion""). In any case, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is well worth watching, both for fans of science fiction and fans of Tom Cruise in general."
" America's favorite Scientologist achieves High Score in video game
",0.4588,0.2115,2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Tom Cruise gets to storm the beaches of WWII France as Player 2 in a first-person-shooter video game. Except the teenage boys who buy all the movie tickets don't think of Germans as the enemy, so we have aliens setting up shop in modern-day France and threatening Earth's good guys. 
At first, Cruise doesn't know how his game controller (aka personal weapon system) works. He doesn't have the slightest idea of which moves to make and he gets killed before he's racked up too many points.
Luckily, this isn't a realistic war movie, it's a video game. So Player 2 gets to start over. He zips through the preliminary stages and this time tallies a few more points before he gets killed. 
During one of these game-lives he meets Player 1 just before they're both killed. Before they hit Play Again, Player 1 has her friend explain to Player 2 (and us) what the objective of the game is so that he's not just pressing random buttons and getting killed too early in the game. Player 1 then teaches Player 2 her best moves. In turn, Player 2 teaches Player 1 his best strategy. 
They get better and better at it each time until they're both racking up the points and they get past Stage 1. 
And on it goes until they get to the final stage. 
There's nothing original in this extravaganza of noise and flashing lights. But as a video game with a bunch of Hollywood cliches tacked on, a $200M budget, and a superstar as Player 2, it's a reasonably entertaining, if immediately forgettable, diversion for a couple of hours.

Edge of Tomorrow wasn't a big hit when it first came out, possibly due to Tom Cruise's Scientology background and the poor trailer. The film received positive reviews, however, the film was still overlooked. Although overtime people came to appreciate its great concept. I was recommended this film and I checked it out in theaters. I was surprised at the excellent blend of humour and action as well as its engaging storyline. Tom Cruise was great in the part and played a very different character. The rest of the cast was also great including Emily Blunt, Brendon Gleeson and the late Bill Paxton. My only complaint with the film is the ending which didn't make much sense. However, this is only a minor gripe with an otherwise entertaining film.I would say this is one of the decades best sci-fi action films along with Dredd, Guardians of the Galaxy and Mad Max Fury Road. If you gave this movie a miss, definitely give it a watch!"

This wasn't all about the special effects. Tom Cruise finally beginning to show some age here (52) but can still carry a blockbuster action type of movie. Emily blunt was also very good, believable, tough and sexy.A pretty inventive sci-fi thriller following Cruise as an officer (who has never seen a day of combat in his life) as he is thrust onto the battlefield as a soldier, repeatedly reliving his own death as he is killed on the battlefield while defending Earth from advancing alien invaders. Finally he seeks the help of a celebrated female warrior in order to defeat the extraterrestrials and save mankind.Sometimes ""Groundhog Day"" type movies can be a bit too repetitive but with each subsequent redo here this managed to still remain fresh with some new bit of info Tom and the viewers experienced."
" Gripping movie with an interesting plot and good acting
",0.6808,0.9984,2017-11-09 00:00:00,9,"I remember watching behind the scenes footage and interviews for this movie back in 2014 and I really did not get the impression that this would be a memorable movie at all. It came across as some generic sci-fi flick that would be some nice popcorn accompaniment with special effects but nothing original in terms of plot and story.Boy, was I blown away when I happened to watch this movie recently on Amazon Prime Video. The movie seems to be very original because I haven't seen a movie with such a unique narration style where most of the movie is about reliving and redoing what happened the first time.Perhaps, this movie even has philosophic undertones as it made me ask the question and presumably more viewers, ""What if I had approached that situation differently or I approach this situation differently in the future, surely a different approach will alter the outcome vastly and perhaps our destiny will be very different if we adapt different attitudes."" The movie definitely comes across at the start as very WW 2 like, reminiscent of the second world war as the troops make an ambitious savage surge at Normandy beach. Tom Cruise acts very convincingly as a bumbling, floundering pretty man PR officer at first who is forced to join the infantry when he has no training and no interest in doing so. His transition from a reluctant inept coward to a virtuoso fast reflex sharp warrior is quite interesting to watch to say the least. Rita (Emily Blunt), the female lead is very convincing in her bad ass role as she and Cage (Tom Cruise) work together to win the war by reliving and redoing things differently. The only part of the movie I'm not fully satisfied with are the alien characters who don't seem to have much motive for their actions except for us to understand that they want to enslave humans and dominate Earth's natural resources. But then again, they are aliens who look fiercely savage and barbaric with their multi- tentacle fast lithe bodies and their savage screams with which they seem to kill all humans effortlessly. All the special effects are added in through the green screen and you'll have some laughs if you watch the movie and then see behind the scenes footage or images.Except for Tom Cruise and Bill Paxton, most of the characters are British so there is a very healthy dose of British and American comedy which makes the film much more fun, providing great moments of relief to the viewer in a movie with a serious concept and plot.Perhaps this sort of plot could even be made in to an interesting series to delve deeper in to the human characters as well as the aliens to understand their motives better.Though I haven't watched any Doug Liman films before this I am definitely going to watch more of his movies now because this film is very good. The writers including Christopher McQuarrie, Jezz Butterworth, John Henry Butterworth as well as the editors James Herbert and Laura Jennings have done excellently in the writing and editing department -- making the movie slick and entertaining when this kind of plot could have been messed up. The cinematography by Dion Beebe and the music by Christophe Beck is breathtaking as well and definitely adds more atmosphere and layers to this movie. The cameos by different actors is very good, comedic as well and it's a stellar team effort with everyone with big and smaller roles delivering some great acting performances. Sometimes it's worth watching a movie even if the initial trailers, behind the scenes footage and interviews don't make it seem very interesting or original. This movie is very interesting and inspiring to say the least but don't take it too seriously, it's just a movie after all! Cheers and thanks for reading!!"

After the awful Oblivion, I dismissed this as another Cruise saves the world movie, which I'd become bored with. For a long time, I actually thought it was called Live. Die. Repeat. As that is how I constantly seen it advertised. Watching it today, I actually enjoyed it. It was pretty fun and not as repetitive as I feared it would be. Crusie is very good in all versions of his role. Emily Blunt is hot, and in great shape, Bill Paxton gives the type of performance you'd expect as does Brendan Gleason.Whilst I don't know if I will want to rewatch it, I may enjoy it more second time around, but overall it was a fun 2 hours.Edge Of Tomorrow grossed $100 million at the domestic Box Office to end 2014 the 33rd highest grossing movies of the year.

" A good science-fiction, action film, but there are many better
",0.7003,0.4033,2017-10-28 00:00:00,6,"""Edge of Tomorrow"", starring Tom Cruise (Cage) and Emily Blunt (Rita), is a mind-bending science-fiction, action film, which was, surprisingly, quite good. After reading the manga adaptation of ""All You Need Is Kill"" (which was renamed ""Edge of Tomorrow""), I was interested to see what the film adaptation was like, with low hopes, due to how most manga adaptations turn out. Saying that, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was high above my expectations, with a great performance from Tom Cruise.Unfortunately, the film begins with some, frankly, cliché, stereotypical, dialogue, which is, thankfully, only used at the beginning but later returns. The film, from there, is great, with a 4/5 first half melding action and science-fiction beautifully. But, the film once more resorted to the use of high-paced action scenes, in the second half, with cuts left right and centre, completely disregarding its science-fiction origins for a small portion of this half; a mistake being the switch of location constantly occurring. The characters are unlikeable (excluding Cage), which is a downside, because they are either stereotypical soldiers speaking cliché dialogue, or an ex-alpha-alien killing woman constantly performing sensual push-ups due to the power Cage possesses. The film tries too hard to create a non-existent rapport with Luke and Rita, which seems stagnant, and should be mellifluous and free-flowing and this halts the progression of the actual story."

" It's not Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day!
",0.0,0.2732,2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of tomorrow.The often quoted description of the film is ""A cross between 'Starship Troopers' and 'Groundhog Day'."". That may give an idea of the genre, but EOT in my opinion, surpasses both its parents and deserves the IMDb 7.9/10, despite the latter's 8.0/10 rating. Tom Cruise (Major William Cage) makes the transition well into a relatively weak story-line. However, although I'm not really an Emily Blunt fan, she is cast faultlessly as Rita R Vratasky, a role which suites her so well, one almost feels it's her real life alter ego. Quite a bit of the story building is intentionally repetitive, to give a sense of Cage's seemingly endless daily nightmare of dying and having to repeat every day. However, that itself is somewhat overdone, because most viewers will be able to imagine that the tiny daily advances will take hundreds of repetitions. The scene leading up to where Cage and Vrataski finally get off the beach is probably the most memorable part of the film showing top class direction and production, then combining all the action, CGI and music (by Christophe Beck, who wrote the music for Frozen). The plot does both lose its way and fade in excitement a little towards the middle of the film and the conclusion you will probably see coming even with both eyes closed. Still, it is worth watching to the end, unlike a lot of films I've stuck with, only to be disappointed."

It stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, with music by Christophe Beck and cinematography by Dion Beebe.It has proved to be a great decade for sci-f, it seems that for every misfire there are three great genre films to off set the disappointments. Sitting at the top end of the table is Edge of Tomorrow (AKA: Live Die Repeat). Adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need Is Kill"", the story has Cruise as William Cage, an American army Major who upon being thrust into combat against an alien race decimating Earth, finds he awakens to the same day after being killed in action. Seeking out Rita (Blunt), the most decorated soldier of the time, Cage must understand what is happening to him and hopefully save the future of mankind.So far so Groundhog Day/Source Code then, but Liman's film never lets up from the get go, frenetic with its action, funny into the bargain, and also sexy, it manages to blend audience pleasing conventions with clever thought and process. There's nothing new in the philosophy on show, and there are regular sci-fi tropes for familiarity of genre, but if you are going to recycle formula then do it with verve and swagger, which this most assuredly does. Boosted by Cruise turning in a good one as an unlikable character who develops into a protag to shout for, and Blunt as a super sexy bad-ass poster girl for the war effort, Edge of Tomorrow ultimately rocks. The science will obviously infuriate those who take such things way too seriously, but as the terror of this particular war unfolds on screen (nifty effects), and we have been bought wholesale into our heroes and their quest, its small failings are hardly worth cocking a snook at. 8/10"

The film also has a great realistic genuine humour which adds a lot to the movie and to its character elements. Edge of Tomorrow is a unique cinematic experience and an excellent action and masterpiece science fiction film with visually dazzling and amazing action sequences and visual effects. Action Scenes are so spectacular and well shot that they looks so realistic and exciting on screen.The Science Fiction elements and time loop aspects of the movie are totally fantastic and feels very fresh each time with each factors of the film. These sequences are very well designed and helps with the smooth progression of the film without effecting its pacing and momentum.The direction of Doug Liman is solid. The performances are very strong. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt both have given one of their best rock solid performance. Their characters are very well developed and their is a very real feel to them. Their characterization is brilliant and well balanced throughout the film. Tom Cruise once again is so amazing and Emily Blunt has really rocked it. She is awesome. The supporting character of Bill Paxton is also very well performed.The film seems rushed at certain points and some scenes feels little unnecessary. Some supporting characters are sidelined and feels little underutilized. The ending seems to be little bit unexplained and may confuse some. All over, Edge of Tomorrow is an epic and excellent science fiction film.On a Special Note I also came to know that Guillermo del Toro was a Special Visual Consultant on the film, and if that's true it is really awesome. Guillermo del Toro is one of the most finest, visually talented and creative visionary director of this decade and one of my most favourite of all time and Edge of Tomorrow is one the best visually gorgeous film.

" Just a mix of Groundhog Day and Starcraft
",0.0,-0.8024,2017-08-31 00:00:00,4,"This movie is pretty poor in deepness (OK it's just more an action movie than real sci-fi) and some dialogues are almost dumb. But hey, it's Hollywood. I used to play Starcraft and I also watched more than once groundhog day, which was a great movie in my opinion, so I see the connection between the two worlds. It's there.For me it's more or less a computer game connected with the learning process a guy makes repeating the day, than a real movie.Nothing more.Everything is moving fast and you don't really have the time or occasion to get into it. But when you start to think about the story line you can't ignore some discrepancies. If you are a coward you want became a tough guy ... it's character not training. But OK let it be. The change of strategy or the dialogues connected with the girl evolves sometimes as like she would remember the day before...but that can't be because it's only him going back.OK, let's turn a blind eye to it.The biggest discrepancy is the end. ***** spoiler alarm ******The end of the movie is non sense pure... Cage was dying but he was still able to drop the bomb to kill Omega, Alpha was not able to stop him. Just to point it out: Cage was able to swim faster the the Alpha alien, but OK. And here it come to the non sense Omega dead, Cage dead, Alpha's blood gives the ability to Cage to go back in time. Cage is just sleeping through the night and wakes up in a helicopter the next day. How is this possible? Who took him out of the water? Why he wakes up the next day with his clean officer uniform?Omega is dead war is over, all the dead of yesterday are now alive. Whaaat? How is this possible? If you go back in time OK it's logic, but if you skip the night the dead which were necessary to kill Omega are still dead. Otherwise nothing of it real happened and Omega should be still alive. What a paradox. The best part Rita and all the others never saw Cage before (the next day?? Once again who helped to kill the beast?). What kind of parallel universe is this? It's non sense. You can make it so stupid. I don't understand why are all the people so enthusiastic about this movie. Special effects great, acting OK, dialogues poor, paradox story line. 4 of 10 is more than fair."

I have to say, I did enjoy it.Firstly, you have to bear in mind that this film doesn't take itself too seriously. There's some very dark humour in here, and it keeps the plot moving along at a good pace.Secondly, those of a third-party gaming bent will probably feel like a lot of ideas and concepts have been borrowed here. From the exosuits to the whole alien attack. I felt like if you'd combined Prey, Fallout 4 and XCOM, you'd end up with this film!I have my reservations about the ending. But it does have a subtle twist that keeps you watching right to the end.So yeah, watch it!"

Like Oblivion I liked to watch the Edge of Tomorrow and especially in the first half the humor elements are well done, and Cruise and Blunt play not only well but have indeed a fine chemistry together.My only critic aims at the fact of this Alpha-Looping - it just won't work this way. Why!? Well, the one rational thing for the Omega to do is to kill an Alpha himself if someone breaks into whatever security perimeter. Think about it - the day would restart and as the Alpha and the Omega know about the powers the next attempt of an attack would be just futile. 2nd thought: in a battlefield of an Earth-scale even if there are only one Alpha in six-million units a battle for a planet would be an operation of all eternity. Why!? In the end, mankind would use nuclear weapons for the last stand. The loss of Alphas and a restart forever would be unavoidable.Well, enough critical thoughts - this movie is certainly for every sci-fi- and action fan indeed a very pleasant gem to watch."
" not just action
",0.0,0.984,2017-08-15 00:00:00,7,"A lot of film fans deplore or criticize Tom Cruise's latest choice of roles. They all seem to be focusing on action movies, with the 55 (!) years old actor cast in roles where the ration between fights, high-speed chases and use of advance weaponry on one side and meaningful story and dialogues on the other is dangerously unbalanced in the favor of the first. His role in the 2014 'Edge of Tomorrow' apparently falls in the same category. However, the film directed by Doug Liman is much more than this. It is actually one of the smartest science-fiction films in the last few years.Time looping is one of the most intriguing themes in science fiction, and has a huge number of variation and derived paradoxes. The authors of the script of this film have taken the idea and introduced it into a 'War of the Worlds' kind of film and actually cinematography and even the evil alien's appearances look quite similar to the one in the films inspired by H. G. Wells classic novel. What is different is that the superiority of the alien race is not based only on physical abilities but on the capability of controlling and resetting time. Luckily, at least some of the humans will be contaminated and use the trick to fight the invasion. I will stop here in order to avoid spoiling too much, with the promise that there are many more surprises, and that the solution and ending combines action and fine sci-fi.Tom Cruise does what he best does (and likes it) in the last decade, with Emily Blunt a good and fit companion to his deeds. Well-paced action combines with smart writing for a film that needs no excuses to be liked."

Edge of Tomorrow is a great sci-fi movie with unforgettable moments that'll make you want to see it over and over."

The special effects are good as well -- top-notch, as was most of the acting. But it played as extremely boring for me, and some of the tropes just ticked me off, especially The Badass Chick meme. The Badass Chick is tough, man. She's the least female creature around, able to kick any and all butt, never emotionally expressing anything other than, ""Check me out; I'm A Badass Chick! I'm cynical and tough! Been hurt, but won't talk about it; instead, I'll just kick yer ass and defy gravity!"" I loathe characters who are supposed to be human, but have no human characteristics. And I guess I'm not into movies filled what that sort of thing. If watching someone playing a shoot-'em-up video game is your thing, you might dig this flick. Not my cuppa."
" A Pleasant Surprise!
",0.69,0.9863,2017-07-23 00:00:00,7,"Starship Troopers meets Source Code meets Groundhog Day meets Mass Effect, with the Hollywood action treatment and gloss of a Tom Cruise piloted blockbuster. The film plays out like an incredibly challenging video game where the viewer is confronted by continuous 'game over' scenarios where the whole scene is repeated again from the perspective of Cruise's character Cage, this allows the film to be unpredictable and thus more entertaining.It was surprising how engrossed I was by a film that appeared to be lacking originality and unpredictability after viewing the formulaic trailer. However, the pace of the film combined with the trial-and-error existence of Cage in the unforgiving alien war zone is intriguing and allows the film to shake off the formulaic predictability of the other high testosterone films in the Hollywood action genre.The entire plot hinges on the magical, time-controlling powers of blue alien blood from the Alpha Mimic alien behemoths which infects protagonist Cage. This is essential to allow the plot to travel to its conclusion with the connection to the alien hive via the blood allowing Cage to see visions through the alien consciousness and locate the alien armies' Achilles heel. This enables the human army to win the war,when it appears that the human race is doomed to extinction by a far superior foe. The climax of the action is satisfying and hits the levels promised at the beginning of the film. The chemistry between Cage and Rita, played by the intense Emily Brunt is pitched correctly and their relationship has sufficient enough authenticity to propel the slower more reflective moments during the middle of the film until the climactic, Parisian crescendo. Overall the film is an entertaining yarn, with enjoyable thrills, alien blood spills and unpredictable twists to keep the audience entertained until the curtain falls. It's a good Saturday night blockbuster with alien brains and even a bearded appearance from Locke from Game of Thrones!Read my full review at: Wafflecast.wordpress.com"

" Impeccable Example of Time Loop
",0.0,0.93,2017-07-17 00:00:00,8,"In the Edge of Tomorrow, there is a story of a ""nation that united against alienation"", that proceeds in militaristic structure as understood from its subject. The only difference that separates from other similar movies that they have put the time loop issue at the center of the story. At the same time, it is a film that interprets fate by presenting various possibilities in the logic of 'what would it be like if I did it like this?' In the Edge of Tomorrow, which engages in the question of the traditional conservative view, which prejudices man should not be able to oversee his destiny, and therefore he should accept it, he is trying to overcome this idea of decisiveness through the cycle of time. The quote which repeated twice in the film ""preparation and discipline make you the master of your fate"" is the proof of opinion.According to Albert Camus, perhaps the deepest desire of man is to obtain what is not available. In other words, it is to know where the life that is likened to a river is born (birth) and where to cast it (death). Because, if he has the knowledge, he will be able to pull the set and direction as he wishes. In the Edge of Tomorrow, of course, it does not use this view to mean the attainment of an existential essence. On the contrary, ""I changed my destiny"". Even if you try to show that you are away from the logic of creating a war hero in similar films, the image created with the point of view (especially from final of film) reverses this unseen situation."

" Typical B Movie That Got Promoted to an A through Lavish Budget
",0.4215,-0.7469,2017-07-11 00:00:00,8,"This big budget romp was concocted to a borrowed formula: 1/3 Groundhog Day 1/3 Starship Troopers 1/3 Minority Report Most of the movie's droll humor comes from the smart mouth of Bill Paxton who plays the hard-ass master sergeant. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt give creditable performances with their mix of acrobatic skill and body chemistry; a duo who defy the odds and carry the day. The premise of this movie violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics, but this was not a movie intended for an audience of physicists, as the plot unwinds you have to suspend disbelief and cut it a little slack. It's a long time since I visited Paris, but isn't I.M. Pei's glass pyramid in the Louvre courtyard, so the crippled aircraft crossing the Seine would have had to crash through the main building in order to reach the omega?"
" A well crafted imitation.
",0.2732,0.9972,2017-06-16 00:00:00,8,"It's unfortunate that this didn't come out a year earlier than it did. Had it been released in 2013, what I felt to be a pretty weak movie year, rather than coming out in 2014, arguably the best movie year of the decade so far, its financial success might have been much higher. Not only that, it was released in June, a major movie month. At its core, it is a pretty cookie cutter sci-fi movie, but it does a lot of things pretty well. I feel like it only falls short because everything in it has been done before; the work that went into it is pretty impressive. The most obvious movie that it is similar to is Groundhog Day, and the way that the time loop is handled here certainly takes a few pages out of Groundhog Day's book. This made the first few days of the time loop a little annoying to watch because I was like ""Alright, I've seen this before. Let's just skip this part."" However, once the second act starts, the movie starts exploring some new territory of the time loop dynamic.Two things that I think it did particularly well with were 1. bringing an interesting emotional element to the plot and 2. constructing the rules of the time loop. It added a lot to the stakes of the plot by making Cage fall in love with Rita after having known her for perhaps several months or years, whereas she only knew him for the one or two days. Then to have him not be able to preserve her forever made for decent emotional access to Cage. The rules of the time loop made for a somewhat more interesting climax as well. With Cage having lost his ""spawning"" ability, there was now a major dramatic clock ticking. Since he had died hundreds of times before, something different had to be done in order to finally destroy the Omega. However, it didn't raise the stakes so much in my mind because the world that the movie created indicated to me that there was very little chance of the humans losing the war. Also, I'm not sure that I really believe they could have destroyed the Omega in the end.Smaller details: the action was pretty cool with the way the aliens fought and the visual effects were pretty impressive. The minor characters, namely the other soldiers that Cage interacted with, were rather annoying and standard. Yes, they had personality, but all their personality amounted to was making them come off like poorly written teenagers. A couple of the time loop rules could have been explained better. For the most part, I was able to understand how it worked, but there were two or three details that I had to puzzle out. Some of that is just me missing the explanation, but it's also partly because such rules were not revealed at the proper time or in the best way.I don't know that this deserves as high of a rating as it has. Not to say that it's bad, but to have it hovering just below the top 250 list seems too high to me. Tom Cruise is in his typical element here, though it may not seem so at first. Emily Blunt plays her part decently, but could have been played by someone else. Fortunately, she isn't sexualized as one might expect, though she is a love interest for Cage. I don't recommend it too highly, but it's a better pick than say Transformers, Independence Day, or Ender's game for alien sci-fi action. One thing I can say for sure in praise of it: there need to be more movies that are executed and written with as much care as was put into this one. Overall Rating: 8/10."

Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really satisfied with everything. Two main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i watched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i don't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her favorite actresses of all time."
" Edge of Tomorrow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat
",0.0,0.9856,2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"I personally love films and stories about time travel, when a film manages to explain its feasibility reasonably enough then it makes for great viewing. Edge of Tomorrow is a unique time travel story that takes place during a modern war where mankind fights an unknown and alien enemy. Tom Cruise is in top form once again as he plays a general who has the ability to relive the day after he dies. His ability is the same as the foreign entity that has the same power. He is assisted by decorated soldier Emily Blunt who once had the same power. Not only does he try and kill the source of the enemy's power but he also tries to save Emily Blunt in the process. The action and special effects are a thrill to watch. Even though the day repeats itself you never get bored because each repeated day is more interesting and action filled than the last. Definitely recommended. People who enjoy sci-fi and time travel stories will particularly enjoy this one."
" A refreshing modern blockbuster
",0.5994,0.9774,2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"OK, so its inspired by Avatar and Spielberg's War of the Worlds. You go in expecting a dumb action-fest with too much CGI and a cardboard plot. But the film introduces a fun twist early on that never gets stale and keeps you invested to the end. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are as strong as the material and the directing is brisk and impressive. The movie must be a love letter to James Cameron with its existentialism, time-travel, futuristic soldiers, self-sacrifice and Bill Paxton. Do not lump this film in with brainless blockbusters like Transformers. This is a real gem."
" Tomorrow Never Dies
",0.0,0.9969,2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Live, die, repeat. Or more appropriately: lather, rinse, repeat. So is the basic premise for Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Not your average Tom Cruise vehicle, the film is built on the premise of a solider who, by some form of luck -- good or bad -- has attained the power to hit refresh on the same day. The catch is, he must die in order to do so. But in repeating the same day over and over again, he gains the edge over the Mimics -- robotic/insect aliens -- that have invaded his planet and eventually wins the trust (and, yes, affection) of his tough-as-nails partner, played by Emily Blunt.That's right, this is basically a sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"" with a video-game twist. Cruise's character re-spawns over and over again until he can learn from his mistakes and make progress. Naturally, this lends itself to a few humorous brushes with fate and a potential for fatigue as the audience is treated to the same action sequence over and over again for most of the first half of the film. No matter, though, as the film is never as dull as its limited premise would suggest. Liman, who directed the exceedingly entertaining and refreshing first ""Bourne Identity"" flick, is right at home with the material. The action is tempered with humor and flickers of humanity, with a surprisingly tolerable turn from Cruise, though Blunt is the real shining star of the movie. Stone- faced and focused, her character is the backbone and the heart of the movie, undercut only when the film sees fit to pull her into an unneeded romantic side-plot with Cruise (who is, incidentally, old enough to be her father). Elsewhere in the cast, we are treated to the always wonderful Bill Paxton as Cruise's increasingly befuddled sergeant. While he misses the perfect opportunity for a reprisal of his ""Game over, man, GAME OVER!"" line from ""Aliens,"" he is another bright-spot in the film. But then again, a little Paxton always went a long way in making any film better (R.I.P.).The film admittedly gets a little soggy in the final act, as the aforementioned romantic subplot is tacked on and the film strains to find a satisfying conclusion. The action ultimately becomes a bit of a blur, and the cinematography gets a little sloppy during the final face-off between Cruise and the Mimics. It doesn't completely undo the goodwill generated by the first half or so, but one can't help but sniff a little bit of last-minute studio-meddling and re- shooting here. Regardless, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a more than satisfactory and unique sci-fi film. Flawed, yes, but most assuredly a solid way to pass a rainy Sunday afternoon."

" Groundhog Day revisited
",0.0,-0.8483,2017-04-12 00:00:00,5,"This movie is an exact copy of Groundhog Day, but in a SFi-setting and to-days special effects. A very weak story line, apparently we have been invaded by aliens (Mimics) and the battlefront is on the continent of Europe. We send soldiers like infantry to fight the aliens on the shores of France ( D-day?) Tom Cruise dies every day and by doing that he relives that day. After endless days of repeating they finally get to the Omega (the head creature of the aliens) this thing hides in the basement of the Louvre in Paris, somewhat unprotected. They kill it and the next day the war is over and Tom finds his sweetheart and they live happily ever after."

Here on earth we can pretend God to be omega and further we can divide and subdivide human race. Yet the carving of Alien race and its supremacy in crafting war was awesome. Even more awesome was a weak race (human race) gains success in war. All of this happened, only with intelligence and efforts of two soldiers and a scientist, which gives one the adrenaline rush.The movie deserves 10/10."
" Brilliant, thoroughly enjoyable
",0.7902,0.9988,2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"Tom Cruise, dare I say, has been making really decent stuff these days, some of which is downright brilliant. Oblivion had its moments, carried on wings of an M83 score that was better than the film itself (hello Tron Legacy syndrome), Jack Reacher was solid badassery all round, but Edge Of Tomorrow is just pure class and could almost be considered an instant classic. I waited a long time to finally see it, because in most cases a pg-13 sci fi blockbuster starring Tom would be cause for me to cruise right on by in the Netflix/on demand lineup and pick something else. The reviews were uncommonly good though, and so I inevitably went for it. I'm sorry I waited, because it's flat out spectacular. What makes it so? Well, it is everything I described above. A sci fi, blow 'em up blockbuster starring Tom Cruise, packed to the gills with action, aliens and stuffed with more Independence Day fireworks than you can shake a stick at. The catch? It has the plot, script and character development to match. This is one seriously thought out story, with heroes who don't start off that way, conflict among the ranks of characters and genuine, honest to god arcs. You can hurl all the cash you want at a film and blow up as much stuff as you can, but if you don't have those core elements of story in place, and well so, you'll end up with a hollow piece of vapid space garbage (like that Independence Day sequel). No, this one earns its stripes, opening up during a chaotic intergalactic war between humans and a formidable alien race, who are winning fast and stamping out any hope for our race. Cruise plays a weaselly military PR puppet who talks tough but has never seen a moment of actual combat, until he's thrown directly into it by chance, with neither skills nor experience to keep him afloat. Stuck in a Groundhog Day esque time loop (I won't spoil the how and why, but it's a wicked smart premise that logically plays out), our coward gradually gains what it takes, day by day, to become a hero and save the planet. It takes a lot of dying and starting over though, each day beginning in the same fashion, the possibilities ripe for him to finally get that perfect round and win the day. Emily Blunt, that adorable badass, plays the most adorable badass thus far in her career, a resilient and vulnerable valkyrie who's rage at the marauding fiends burns through terrifically, providing moments of grit, warmth and humour as needed. Bill Paxton plays a gung-ho military honcho with the same gee whiz charm that made Pvt. Hudson (Aliens, for you plebs) so memorable, and Brendan Gleeson does a third act encore as another General who takes a fair bit of convincing to get onboard with their plan. It's so much fun you never want it to end, the high concept used for all it's worth, supported by truly inspired creature design, detailed steam punk style weaponry and old school Hollywood fanfare rationed out in deliciously measured portions, resulting in that perfect recipe, an effects driven crowd pleaser with the brains to back it up. Who knew they could still make that? It's a thing of beauty."
" Edge of the Source Code of Tomorrow's Adjustment Bureau
",0.0,-0.9633,2017-03-09 00:00:00,6,"I so dislike Tom Cruise that when I pay attention to a character he's playing, I feel as if I've gotten my time's worth out of a movie. I so like Emily Blunt that she could spout some dreary anti-Trump twaddle on a late-night comedy show, and I would turn off the sound and just gaze.Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow gets off to such a weak start, with Cruise looking as if he lost his confidence when he heard ""action"" and Brendan Gleeson looking bored to tears, that I almost gave up. But I stuck around, deciding I would give the movie a chance. And off she went!Cruise's character is such a spineless feather-merchant that you actually start to enjoy his discomfort-fear-loathing-confusion-panic as he gets dropped onto a beach in France to fight some sort of spider/octopus thingies, of which there are about a zillion. He sees Blunt get killed, then gets it himself, and . . .Wakes up where he started, at a staging area for the invasion force in England.With some dandy editing, forgivable lapses in logic, enough true humor, and the whole concept of reliving your death so that you don't get killed, eventually, the viewer gets hooked. Deep.And then the last reel starts, and the whole thing falls apart. It's a murky mess, with a bunch of volunteers helping Cruise and Blunt fight their way to the queen spider thingamabob (which actually looks like a spongy, electrified golf ball) to kill it. It's all so dark and confusing that the viewer wonders what the hell happened to the crisp narrative in the first two thirds.Oh, well.All in all, it was a good use of time. I gauge ""good"" by how much I'm not getting done around the house. The chores don't get done, and the movie gets above a 5. My wife gets home and wonders if I did anything, the score goes up.I told her that the movie had Emily Blunt, and she rolled her eyes and said something unpleasant.She doesn't like Tom Cruise either."
" Fighting the aliens with a grin
",0.1531,0.6929,2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"One would hardly think of Tom Cruise having a lighter side, but in Edge of Tomorrow his character is actually flawed and funny.The plot is sort of Groundhog Day plus alien invasion. Cruise plays Cage, a liaison officer forced to fight against the aliens. Trouble is, he is a coward and has no real military training.Without mentioning any spoiler, Cage gets in trouble from day one, but he also gets a chance to re-live the same day, improve his fighting skills and getting to know female war hero Rita (AKA ""full metal bit*h""). Rita and Cage together are the only chance to win the alien invasion. They are not a good match, but their imperfections work well together.Emily Blunt plays Rita convincingly as a tough fighter and she has a lot of chemistry with Cruise. Despite the violence of some scenes, the movie has some funny parts and it is very entertaining. Bill Paxton is also in it, regrettably one of his last movies."
" Solid Science-Fiction
",0.1531,0.885,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"For some reason, this film really didn't ""catch on"" in its advertising stages. First billed as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and touted as an action shoot-em-up (I remember seeing the trailer in theaters), it then morphed into ""Live, Die, Repeat"" and was re-branded as a time-travel escapade. Though the film deserved a more coherent approach to garner some box office success, its dual- personality is shown within the movie as well.For a basic plot summary, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sees Cage (Tom Cruise), a military man, sent to the front lines of combat against an alien threat against the planet. Almost immediately after parachuting into enemy territory, the entire mission goes awry and everyone dies. And then Cage wakes up at the beginning of that same day. With only a vague reference to female fighting hero Rita (Emily Blunt) to guide him, Cage must simultaneously find out what the heck is happening to him while also trying to win the battle for his country.""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a solid movie. Cruise is great (as usual), the plot is mind-bending, and the action is top-notch. I was entertained throughout and never felt bored or confused.That isn't to say that this is an all-time classic. There is no context given for the alien invasion (which is very disappointing from a plot standpoint), and the ending (IMHO) leaves a bit to be desired. Also, I was very disappointed in Blunt's performance as the female lead. Her character is an integral part of the story, and it comes across as very weak and ultimately useless. I think that she was cast wrong for this role, as a more likable/approachable presence would have played much better to interact with Cruise's character. I know she is supposed to be ""tough"", but that toughness doesn't end up meaning much if the character falls flat.Overall, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a solid science fiction effort. It's very entertaining, but fails to truly be great because of a few major flaws. Like the advertising for the film, director Doug Liman doesn't quite seem to know exactly what he wants the picture to be. Very comparable to another Cruise sci-fi flick ""Oblivion""."
" What I feel to be the best possible explanation for the ending.
",0.6369,0.9984,2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"I just got done watching it, I'm really mad at myself for not seeing it sooner, and as I'm looking online for peoples interpretations of the ending I cannot find anyone who agrees with me. However that doesn't deter me from believing what I think really happens in the end because no other ending is as happy as what I think I may have seen, if it is really as clever a film as I believe it to be.SPOILERS AHEADMost people seem to think that the last resetting of time has something to do with chronology; about when the Omega died and how that was earlier than the alpha so the time reset to an earlier point, I actually find that flimsy yet I'm seeing that everywhere.Please hear me out but what if Cage is the now the Omega in the same manner that he was the Alpha and time wasn't just resetting to an earlier point based on outside circumstances, but it was being reset to a point designated by Cage and furthermore since the resetting of the day does not result in the loss of his powers but it becomes something that he keeps the way he kept the powers of the Alpha. Cage reset the day and he can do it again, and again, and again and now he functions as the controller rather than the trigger since it was the powers of the controller and not the trigger that he absorbed this time and ultimately, and this is where I'm gonna lose you but what if as an Omega himself he is fixated on his the relationship that he has with Rita and that, while the Omega reset the day whenever it's Alpha died, it's protector, half of what it needs to feel complete, who's bond is so unacceptable to be without, altering time itself rather than go on existing without the bond, what if now he will forever and ever be able to reset the day based on the death of Rita, his own Alpha, his own counterpart. Just as the Alpha was the counterpart of the Omega and the Omega reset time rather than allow the loss of what is identifies to be an integral part of itself, so too does Cage now reset the day based on the being that he cannot and will not tolerate the loss of, the being that he is incomplete without .... and so now... Rita will never die, Cage will not allow it and will reset time any time that she does, and the two literally live happily ever, and forever and ever and ever and ever, after. Rita will go back to being the champion and hero of the war as the new Alpha and the protector that she already was in nature, so too will Cage revert back to his truer peaceful and non-violent nature, all the while empowering his chosen Champion just as he by nature found himself more suited to a life of rallying and inspiring troops to fight than to fight himself, becoming the love and undying support that the warrior needs every bit as much as the gentle half needs the protection of the warrior.It's a little harder to see because the roles are flipped from what we are used to in terms of gender the men more traditionally being the fighters. But it isn't who these characters are. Cage has lived the life he lived up to the beginning of the film as a coward because the fight is not within his nature. And now that Cage has a choice in the matter, WHERE DOES TIME GET RESET TO. TO WHAT POINT? To a point that results in Cage never being forced to act against who he really is as a person. And time abilities or not Rita was a soldier and a fighter to start because that's who she is inside.Cage picked a time that not only brings his other half back to life, but to a point where they are allowed to be themselves. Because now that he will be with Rita forever, wouldn't it be best if the love they will now get to have were based on honesty and truth with both eternal partners being who they really are? Aren't all lasting relationships and loves in life built around such fearless honesty about who we really are inside? Could any eternal love really work if either Cage or Rita were trying to be something that they are not? Can any of us really be loved if we aren't willing to bear our souls and show the ones we love who we really are? And would a love without end that repeats over and over forever, would that love demand anything less?So it's not just ending about the potential for love or lucky timing that results in Cage being given a chance to try to win her over with a clever line. That would just cheapen things. it wouldn't merit the immortality that it's been granted. Instead it happens from the best possible beginning point. Where it can be laid on the solid groundwork of not just appreciation for the other, but of the self-acceptance and honesty that all unending loves demand."

My taste hardly stretches past Interstellar, but I had to sit back and take 2 after the ending just to get my head together, checking my world was real. Would put it up there with Alien & and all the other champions of sci-fi. My mind is still a little bit dizzy from just finishing the film, but felt compelled to write a review. Arguably one of the best I've ever seen. The camera filming, the way it must of been directed, all these things make it a true art of film- making. Although there were parts where you aren't always aware of what's going on it pieces itself together perfectly and I was kept on the edge of my seat for the entire film. Isn't that what films should do to us? I feel like that sort of thing is lost in modern film-making, but this truly is a marvel and I congratulate the director and writer for bringing to life such as genius idea."

The premise is used to great effect, with Tom Cruise's character, Cage, growing more and more competent with every loop. Emily Blunt is also great as the mentor character who has to learn everything again at the beginning of every cycle.In terms of the film as a whole, the aesthetic is extremely well matched to the tone of the film and the film is very well written, with enough humour mixed in to make an excellent film.The only reason that this film does not get a 10/10 from me is that the end feels a bit too much much like Deus Ex Machina but, in terms of the film, it works very well. As much as I don't like these kinds of ending where everything just gets wrapped up in a neat bow, this worked well. However I just can't give it 10/10 so Edge of Tomorrow gets a 9/10"
" Action movie as best as it gets
",0.6369,0.9963,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie - the epitome of a good action movie, and a tribute to Cruise as action hero.The Edge of Tomorrow reminded me of Groundhog Day in its philosophical premises. It is a constant day repeating itself until the hero gets it right. The difference is that in Groundhog Day the aim of the story is to give time to the character to redeem himself, to become his best self and get a fulfilling life; so the repeating day is a personal intimate quest. The Edge of Tomorrow is more about the process of change itself, on learning of your mistakes, correcting them, trying again until you achieve your goals. Of course, if you are a video-gamer that is what you do when you play, but I don't think it would be fair reducing this movie to a on-screen video-game, because I don't feel it is.Tom Cruise is the quintessential action hero to me. He is always fantastic in action movies, no matter the quality of the script, as he is able to carry his characters with honesty and soulfulness. This movie is greatly indebted to him because, although the script is good, Cruise nails it; we are there with Cage, not with Cruise, if you know what I mean.I am not a fan of Emily Blunt but she is believable in this movie, but not a romantic counterpart to Cruise. She and Cruise don't have much chemistry on camera; they would make good brother and sister, a romantic couple, not so much. Yet, the romantic story is not the essence of the story, so it doesn't really matter.All the supporting actors are terrific. Frantic action and great special effects are two assets of this movie. The latter aren't there per se, to fill the gaps in the script and wow the spectator with fluff, they are there to serve the script and contribute to the overall story. That is how things should be in film making, but they are rarely so these days.The film is very entertaining, a great action film, one of those films that ticks all the wows one expect to find in a 21st century action science-fiction film, but more indebted in its premises to the mindful action movies of the 1980s.Pure entertainment and more than meets the eye in the story."
