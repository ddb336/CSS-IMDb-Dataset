" Actually very good from the director of The Cell
",0.4927,0.9337,2021-04-08 00:00:00,6,"Selfless is a 2015 sci fi drama starring Ryan Reynolds, Ben Kingsely,Victor Garber,Matthew Goode and Michelle Dockery. The film is about an aging billionaire named Damien(Kingsley) who is dying. So he decides to be a guinea pig for this corporation owned by Albright(Goode) to transfer his body into someone else's. Alas he enters Ryan Reynolds body who's real memories keep coming out. Could he be Mark,a devoted father and husband who offered his life for his daughter.Overall I thought it was a good flick. I liked the twists and turns this film had . Ryan Reynolds is a very versatile actor and I love watching his films(yes I even watched both Deadpool films and enjoyed them too).If you want to track down a hidden gem film then do give this one a try."
" A solid movie
",0.1531,0.971,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,While it had moments that were mixed up and probably some plot holes all and all I throughly enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of Ryan but I could handle him in this non type casted role. It was good to see him something other than a sarcastic character who thinks it's charming to be so. Great story and also was impressed with the female lead. She needs another big lead.
" Totally stupid and typical Hollywood
",-0.5709,-0.3136,2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,Don't see it by reading the plot and getting excited like I did. Its 2 hr wasted. Nothing interesting. Consider it a movie where the protagonist finds out some secret and in order to save someone goes against a powerful person or corporation. But somehow eventually manages to defeat them. We have atleast every 3rd movie with same plot.
" Perfectly decent action/sci fi movie
",0.6369,0.4404,2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,Reynolds is good as ever in this 'comes as advertised' actioner.
" Predictable Ending.
",0.0,-0.3009,2021-03-03 00:00:00,4,Come on. I didn't want it to be predictable. The beginning of the movie suggested that the character wouldn't end the saga with a sappy American ending. I was looking for more than a quasi-action movie.
" Actually quite ok
",0.3597,0.0799,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Interesting plot, good acting but you just can't take Deadpool fully seriously."
" the soundtrack!
",0.0,0.9688,2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This was a great surprise of a movie, I just wasn't expecting my speakers to light up. I didn't know I had lights in these newish speakers, the woofer has one but that's on all the time.
This movie might seem to have a familiar premise but this story pulled out a level of clever visual framing and amazing production and a soundtrack that drives the whole thing in a way loud soundtracks very rarely manage to pull off, it seems without Eiko Ishioka costume design Tarsem Singh used sound to raise the level of the drama the way costume and set design might be used.
Ben Kingsley was a credible ""moral"" billionaire even if he lived in an apartment that looked exactly like DJT had just moved out.
The casting was top notch all round. Everything was explained when the directors credit came up, I hadn't checked that beforehand."
" Must watch if you like sci-fi thriller
",0.4404,0.3919,2021-02-15 00:00:00,9,Well executed movie with logical explanation throughout. Will enjoy every bit of this movie. Reminds me of Paycheck movie. Not gonna say anything more but watch it yourself.
" Ryan Reynolds isn't just a comedy actor...
",-0.2755,0.0089,2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Despite his major roles in comedy films, Reynolds proves he can pull of a serious role while still being the hilarious character that he his. This movies plot is interesting but I wouldn't put it anywhere higher than an Eight. No this is not the GREATEST OF ALL TIME but it is definitely worth watching."
" Matthew Goode always great potrait a villain
",0.128,0.8957,2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Tell you the truth, I'm watching this movie because matthew Goode in it. And I think the movie was good too, if you're like fiction genre..
Matthew Goode it's one great underrated actor.."
" Entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.7907,2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"An action packed thriller, where the basic plot has been done before, not not as well as this. The acting from all the lead actors is great, good action and stunt scenes, and there are no dull moments. A good movie to watch."
" Competent sci fi thriller; don't know why critics were so harsh
",0.1015,0.11,2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Certainly it treads some well-worn sci-fi territory, but I thought its spin was fresh enough not to get bashed the way it did. I ran into this film on Netflix and hadn't heard of it, probably because my kids were little then and I stopped following new movies closely as I couldn't see them in theaters. It definitely gave me more insight into Ryan Reynolds' appeal, which had mostly eluded me before.My suspicion is that this film didn't work as well on a large screen, but the action sequences are well-staged, and you've got Sir Ben Kingsley and Michelle Dockery fer cryin' out loud. OK, Sir Ben could have troweled on that New York accent a little more lightly, but his performance launches the movie with enough energy that I was drawn in. The film's trite electronic score, which mercifully intrudes less as the film progresses, may have contributed to its bad reception. Is the movie predictable as charged? Only in the way that all sci fi thrillers tend to be, but its ending is also the logical conclusion of the story the movie tells. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy this movie more than the critics led you to suspect."
" Glad it was a 12 rating
",0.4588,0.6705,2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,Brilliant film if they had made it a 15 rating this film would have got out of control for no reason it didn't need it. Kids can watch it and that's a good thing.
" Solid Sci-fi Action Thriller
",0.25,-0.6126,2021-01-21 00:00:00,9,"An interesting, but relatively simple premise and plot, sometimes predictable, very well directed, acted, and shot. In different hands, with different choices this could have been schlok, but as it was it was solid, likable, and believable. Light, near-future sci-fi, fist fights, gun fights, a car chase/game of chicken, themes of family, emotions....things are made obvious, but not spoon-fed.....I was impressed and highly recommend it."
" Solid 7
",0.1531,-0.5423,2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,The pro critics are morons. That's all I got. That's it.
" Just didn't quite do it for me
",0.0,0.9516,2021-01-19 00:00:00,6,"There's a lot to like about Self/less. I think it has a very intriguing and well thought out plot, which is crucial for a film like this. You also can't go wrong with Ryan Reynolds. He's such a good leading man and is so watchable, transforming pretty much any film he's in. The rest of the cast were also great, with a shout out to Matthew Goode playing his sinister role to perfection.What I think its main failing is though is its pace. This film seemed to really drag. I'd seen the trailer and as a result knew exactly where this film was headed, and it took a long time to get there. As a result I found that the first 45 minutes or so dragged, and then once things did start to pick up we fell into a slump before the final act. It felt a lot longer than the two hour runtime. This is a pretty cardinal sin in my book.Aside from this I actually quite liked the film. The characters were interesting, the plot entertaining, and the action well executed.It won't blow you away, and is kind of a middle of the road forgettable film, but is certainly entertaining enough."
" Actually not a bad movie, but...
",0.431,0.8849,2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I agree with one of my fellow critics here. It would have been nice to see Damian's character develop a little more. Not only, but also because Ben Kingsley is by far the better actor - in my humble opinion. The story is good and full of twists. Only the last 15 minutes or so lose in tension and get too predtictable. It seems like the makers - Netflix - wanted to do their usual: Get everything to the end that the viewer expects and that satisfies the U.S. American requirement for ""the good always wins"". So after all I gave this movie six stars.
And now for the big BUT. It is quite obvious from the bginning that Apple products are being held into the camera way too much. In several scenes an actor, mainly the lead, just pauses in his movement just when the inevitable backlit fruit is visible. Too many scenes include the actor setting up the Apple laptop - completely uselss for the plot or the movie. But the really great BUT happens in a scene, when that criminal, doctor, villain compares Edison, Einstein and Stevieboy Jobs. Two genius scientists and the CEO of a marketing company / money-making-machine? At that point the movie lost five points on it's rating, which brings it down to a 1 at the end. Leave the product placement, but bring it down to a level so it doesn't become ridiculous. It is a valid source of money for today's movie makers - at least in the USA. But do not put such a nonsense into the mouth of the main character and the plot of an otherwise decent movie."
" Preposterous and just not good
",-0.3412,-0.7174,2021-01-17 00:00:00,5,"It's a preposterous story line. But, that's not always a problem with films.
There aren't any gaping plot holes, it has been thought through.
But - it is just not very good. Its not a great watch. Its not overly captivating."
" I've watched this twice and is brilliant
",0.5859,-0.6808,2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,Not much to say without spoiling it. But it poses a moral dilemma and then then shows the humanity rather than the greed. Literally selfless
" Pretty good movie
",0.7269,0.6478,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,Dont know why this is so underrated.ryan reynold did well in this vmovie...the concept is really good
" Irritating sound track.
",-0.4588,0.0889,2021-01-15 00:00:00,3,"Premis of the story sounds good, but lacking in ability to engage viewer. Really annoying soundtrack that doesn't fit in the slightest."
" Downton deals in dangerous drugs...
",-0.4767,0.8945,2021-01-15 00:00:00,7,"OK, so he was terrific in ""Gandhi"" (1982) but ever since, Sir Ben Kingsley seems to have struggled to play anything more substantial that a mid-rate baddie with sinister eyes... Here, sadly, he is no different as he portrays ""Damian Hale"", a ruthless billionaire property magnate who has a terminal illness. To try and cheat death, he arranges with a suitably duplicitous ""Albright"" (Matthew Goode) for his consciousness to be transferred into a new, fit, young ""Damian"" (the fit young Ryan Reynolds). Shortly after, though, his new life starts to become blurred with the memories of his host. Are they just hallucinations or is his host (""Ed Kidner"") fighting back; trying to re-assert control over his own mind and body? This conflict only heightens when ""Ed"" starts to put flesh on the bones of his ""dreams"" discovering a real family and a real chance of happiness away from the pill-addicted existence created by ""Albright"". Reynolds is good in these sort of films; he has a glint in his eye and a charm about him that forgives his rather wooden acting abilities. The pace, once we have dispensed with the older iteration of ""Damian"" picks up well with a fair smidgeon of action and a bit of romance with Natalie Martinez. It's way too long - the story becomes way to dependant on the charisma of the star too early on in this process, but red herrings there are to keep us guessing before a suitably incendiary conclusion. It won't win any prizes, but I quite enjoyed it."
" Tasty & Inventive story
",0.0,0.9202,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Interesting twist on an old problem - that of death, salt-peppered with an avalanche of additional problems arising from complications of the actual procedure used to extend life. Raises many interesting philosophical and ethical issues on the problem of transferring consciousness from one body to another, some of which may be of particular interest to adherents of Transhumanism, a movement which pushes for the extension of life through any possible/available means. Consciousness and Identity, Mind & Body Problem, Ego and Id, all relevant philosophical problems related to the issues raised, with moral side overtones and whistles from merging consciousness from (at least) two different people. The issue is quite complex and this movie presents some of the ethical problems raised. Falls a little heavy on the obligatory part that tries to justify a prior good moral code, but still quite successful in delivering a powerful interpretation of what a possible solution to the problem of death might entail. Nice plot, action, visuals, not too much tangential over runs, complicated twists and the obligatory Evil Scientist, who operates without any moral restraints whatsoever. Like others have pointed out, a mix between Limitless and Face On/Off, but more philosophically involved. Too bad only because the actual procedure used is pure fiction; such tech is unheard of. Excellent performances by both Kingsley and Reynolds, like Limitless, it's definitely worth your time. Don't miss it."
" Good entertaining!!!

" Fairly good
",0.4404,0.9756,2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"The cinematography, directing and screenplay is absolutely stunning.Great characterization, interesting characters and a stellar cast.Action scenes can be boring at average at times, car scene had no visible damage in some shots even after multiple hits. Special affects only okay.The plot has somewhat been done before but i don't think ive seen it done quite like this or quite as good and interesting as this plot delivers. Ultimately in the end you know what's gonna happen and things are fairly obvious but its a sweet heart felt and roller coaster of a ride to get there.Overall I would suggest this to anyone who has 2.5 hours to spare. Watch it on Netflix for free! I know it gladly did."
" Good sci-fi thriller
",0.5106,0.9871,2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"My rating scale is simple, was I entertained. In this case I was. The movie had a good flow, interesting story, and a good combination of sci-fi & action mix. Is it a movie I'll remember years from now? Probably not but it kept my interest and I actually cared about the characters and how it came to an endThe ""how"" in this movie isn't really explained, and I kind of like that as sometimes mystery is good, and you can't rip holes in it either. While the premise of course is a bit far fetched, the acting is good, the action as well and I can't really complain about too much.If you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi action thriller give it a watch"

" A good, underrated flick
",0.4404,0.7063,2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,"This one went under the radar (never knew it existed until recently).If you're after an entertaining movie that's not too long or disjointed, this does the job very well. Characters are very likeable. Pot, whilst not the most innovative, is easy to follow and makes sense. The pacing and structure is pretty good. Action is okay. And the premise of the movie is quite entertaining if you're into sci-fi.In terms of actor performances, the main lead, Ryan Reynolds is very good in this. Plays a very good protagonist whose cause / journey you can root for. He also has good chemistry with some of the characters. Ben Kinglsey, despite limited screentime, is great.Try not to listen to the negative reviews. But also try not to have great expectations, as this movie doesn't aim to be great. It's just a fairly decent flick to keep you entertained. Give it a try."
" Good movie if you like scifi and Ryan Reynolds
",0.6597,0.8714,2020-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Only complaint is that it stretches the story out way too long; what is a 2 hour movie could be the length of a black mirror episode. Now that i think about it felt very much like a bm episode.
Anyways, great acting, compelling story and over all a fun movie i recommmend seeing"
" Very predicable.
",0.0,0.0,2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,Decent movie reminded me a lot of Limitless. Very predicable.
" A remake of 'Seconds' by John Frankenheimer
",0.0,-0.8606,2020-02-11 00:00:00,4,"Once I realized this was a remake I lost all interest. The original starring Rock Hudson is far more chilling. This is just another retread of which we are buried in nowadays. It is well acted and well made but has no flavor once you realize it is just another ""I have no imagination so I'll just rip off a classic"" effort. I am really tired of seeing this process take place. Another is Jacobs Ladder. It really is hard to find a movie that isn't a remake of a classic. What is next? Casablanca??"
" poor performance
",-0.4767,-0.7574,2020-02-08 00:00:00,3,"The story had an interesting basic idea, so the film started interestingly.
But after the transfer of the mind into the new body, the quality of the film has greatly decreased. There were many gaps and unanswered questions.
The plot was rarely exciting, so mostly boring.Aside from the Deadpool movies, Ryan Reynolds has only appeared in bad movies. I noticed exactly the same development with Nicolas Cage."
" Very simplistic and misguided (not good sci-fi either)
",0.4404,0.8112,2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"This film is full of underdeveloped ideas and concepts. It's starts off somewhat promising, but along the way it just transforms into Schwarzeneggers The 6th Day re-make (which wasn't great in the first place) with flamethrowers.First of all, the film looks like it's set in present time, but it handles consciousness transfer as nothing mind-blowing or groundbreaking. Just imagine what can be achieved when you can imprint any human being inside another one. Some great and dangerous ideas are here. But no, the film uses this very poorly. They should've set this far into the future to make it something ordinary or take it more seriously if it was set in modern times.Second, we don't get nearly enough old Kingsley character to understand his motivations. He's all over the place. He takes the transfer easily and starts enjoying life which he didn't seem to enjoy in the first place as much. They give you a couple of hints that he still feels young at heart, but it all falls down to picking beautiful women in clubs and having sex in his luxury apartments. This would've made the dilemma much stronger, the choice between retaining his young body and returning a father into the family.Third, the ending was way too obvious and was super easy to achieve. Damien just gave it up like it mattered nothing to him. He is not nearly believable as a property mogul. There is no transition in him from a selfish person and the self-sacrifice makes no sense. His motivations overall just make no sense. He's way too caring for a random person when it is clearly not his character. I mean, there is so much you can do with this concept. Just make him suffer, try to go to his daughter and reconnect, make her reject his younger version.Forth, the main ""villain's"" motivation also makes no sense. He looks like a smart person at first, but as the story progresses he just becomes a money-obsessed crook, and in the end for a minute he spits out childish philosophy.I mean, I wanted to see the film only for the concept of immortality and it's price, but instead I got lots of pointless action scenes The 6th Day's style.Also, the main female lead's voice was annoying, sorry.Maybe I expected too much from Tarsem.P.S. I love how he was able to put more pointless ""weird imagery"" in this like he did in the Cage, oh, Tarsem."

" Selfless is an good overall theme for this movie, don't you think?
",0.4404,-0.7311,2019-10-28 00:00:00,7,"If I had to compare this to any movies it would be The Island meets Limitless. I personally found this movie to be a welcome treat especially since it has to do with ultimately doing the right thing in the end. Ben Kingsley plays a man named Damian who is in the business of closing some of the best deals in real estate market (in New York I think). The audience soon discovers that he has no more then six months to live. He is given an invitation to look at an company that uses something called shedding technology. He ponders this decision and decides to go for it after asking a few questions of the owner of this shedding tech company. The company has a few conditions such as he die in a public place after he gets his final affairs in order. He flies to New Orleans and does just that after drinking a certain coffee in a New Orleans restaurant. Things get even moreover interesting from there. His mind gets put into the body of a young man played by Ryan Reynolds whom Damian was told was created in a lab. Damian starts to adjust to being in his new body slowly and finds that he is told to take a red pill everyday to ward off the side effects of the body transfer. He starts to see things such a people, places and things that he has never seen before thus showing the audience that this body once belonged to a real person and just wasn't created in a lab like a mindless human robot. Reynolds starts living hIs life in New Orleans in the so called highlife with one night stands in the nicest houses and coolest most expensive cars but pre life flashes still haunt him. Reynolds's becomes shocked and anger at the shedding company after he discovers the horrific truth that his new body is indeed someone else and not grown in a lab like some sort of human robot. To make a long story shorter he decides to stop taking the red pills by the movies end and previous owner of Ryan Reynolds body gets his life back in end. This is a movie that makes me think If I would choose the right thing in the end and give the life back to it's previous owner or would I shake it off and just live the rest of my.....his life like I was wearing a new very expensive suit. Just a few thoughts for us to ponder folks."

Now I have to go watch every flick with Natalie Martinez in it."
" wasted potential
",-0.4939,0.8102,2019-10-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie has a great cast, it's very visually impressive, and the plot idea has so much potential. so where did this movie go wrong? they tried to cram so much information and plot into so little time. the plot falls apart and turns into a basic good-guy-bad-guy-shooting film, just like most action movies made lately. almost as soon as Damian meets Mark's family, the last intriguing shreds of the plot fall away, and then you're left with a disaster. too many predictable plot twists that Matthew Goode and Ryan Reynolds try so hard to hold together. you can't put your illogical and messy plot on the backs of your actors and expect your movie to be good, unfortunately. it was entertaining though, as much as I hate to admit it, and I absolutely loved getting to see Matthew Goode and Michelle Dockery in something together again since Downton Abbey (even though their characters never got to officially meet). this movie is a good time-waster, especially for any fans of Ryan Reynolds, but don't come here expecting to have a good, logical story that makes sense."
" Missed opportunities
",0.1027,0.9455,2019-10-03 00:00:00,6,"This sci-fi thriller was almost really good, some missed opportunities as we follow Ben Kingsley as a dying new York real-estate tycoon who undergoes a top secret procedure to transfer his consciousness into the body of a healthy young man. Of course he soon finds out (now as Ryan Reynolds) that neither the procedure or the company are quite what they seem.I appreciated the uniqueness of this story unfortunately it could have been better. When Ben wakes up in Ryan's body he no longer acts like Ben, any of his mannerisms or oldness and they also should have played more into Ben discovering that his body knows how to do spy stuff like fighting, basketball etc. maybe Jason Bourne style instead of focusing on peanut butter. I liked the ending, sacrifice."
" Mediocre sci fi continuity mess
",-0.3612,0.9596,2019-09-20 00:00:00,5,"I hate to shout ""The Emperor has no clothes"", but when one sees the number of 8 to 10-star ratings here for this flick, it becomes apparent that a whole lotta people don't know good cinema from their hind end.Not that it's wrong to say ""I really really liked this movie. 10 stars!"" Different people have different tastes and for some, this is a thrill ride and that's all they're looking for. But rating a movie and REVIEWING a movie is two different things. It's amazing how many people seemed to miss the numerous flaws in this production.The major inconsistency is the total dissimilarity between Kingsley and Reynolds representation of the main character. To maintain continuity and story line, more time should have been spent on establishing Kingsley's personality and mannerisms (instead of rushing him off screen ASAP)... and those mannerisms should have carried strongly to Reynolds. Most notable was Kingsley's strong and unique accent... none of which was present in Reynolds. Since they chose for Kingsley to affect an accent in the first place, why not Reynolds'?But it doesn't stop there. There is no similarity whatsoever between the short glimpse we get of Kingsley's character as a person and Reynolds follow-up. They are as different as night and day. Some of this could logically be attributed to storyline explanations, but compete loss of everything Kingsley presented during the first of the film is simply bad writing and directing.The plot was nothing new. It's been done before and better. Still, that's not a problem if the story is done well. This wasn't. The concept had great potential and a fine (if highly predictable) resolution... but the majority of the film was basic sci fi action / chase scenes / combat / car wrecks... which while well done and ""exciting"", fairly ruined the potential of the film.If you're looking for action adventure and a rather high body count, this film has it. If you're looking for good, meaningful sci fi... there's not much of that here. Add to this fairly weak characters (both mother and child), cliche characters (the evil mad scientist), even more cliche characters (no shortage of henchmen to shoot in this one!), and we have a plot line that is mediocre at best.Many reviewers here found these same flaws, and it's gratifying to see that they demand more of a film than ""Wow, it had really great fight scenes!"" and a high intentional-kill body count.This film could have been so much more, dug much deeper into personalities and relationships, examined and debated the ethical situation in greater detail, and certainly resolved that ethical situation in a far-less-cliche manner. As it turns out, it's just another sci fi adventure flick that leaves so very many stones un-turned. For the thinkers out there this may be a bit of an adrenaline kick, but prove disappointing overall."

" Ghost in the Shell as an American action flick without the ghost.
",-0.0869,0.4989,2019-08-20 00:00:00,4,"I will keep my impressions short. Whoever thinks this movie is underrated or critics are idiots for rating it so low, I urge you to watch the original Ghost in the Shell anime movie. It basically steals the concept from that and turns it into a run-of-the-mill American action flick. Nothing in this movie stood out except the concept of the movie. This movie had the potential to explore its themes and original concept but instead we got a watered down action flick where you really cannot feel anything. The main character has glimpses of complexity but ends up being kinda one note and boring. Honestly, if you like an action flick to watch if you have nothing else to, it is serviceable. But if you want something more from a stereotypical American action flick, I would suggest to pass on this movie."

Reynolds pulls this film together as a dead soldier, and dead-ish real estate tycoon a-hole perfectly. And to think I just watched him as freaking Pikachu a week ago! Versatility, I tell ya.Really though, this is a great Hollywood film, with some loose plot devices that while they started to bug me I quickly let them go as this is quite a Fantastic plot in the first place. Action scenes abound and the sound is incredible. But what really impressed me is how I really felt the main character's pain; as another man, as himself, as a dead version, as a Father, as a failure. It even had a feel-good almost Disney ending but it's cool. Oh, by the way, it's directed by Tarsem Singh who is responsible for one of the the greatest LOOKING films ever made: The Fall. Kudos.

Ryan Reynolds is a very good actor, and yes, a delicious one at that, who offered enough eye candy.This is the first of Tarsem's films to not feature his trademark stunning costumes, visuals or set designs. Interestingly enough, this is also the first of his films to not win any awards, or even a nomination. Although the film is interesting enough with lots of exciting action, I somehow just didn't buy into it.

At the first 30-minute-mark, it definitely seemed like a good choice though. Then, every tiny thing in the movie becomes almost a hundred percent predictable and follows a very cliche storybuilding, and bad -awful- acting comes in. At some point, the sci-fi element of the movie becomes absurd, with some objects and events defying the rules of physics, likewise bulletproof glasses easily melting, or bullets surviving MRI machines. In this absurdity, the whole focus of the film goes from scientific to action-oriented, simply guys chasing each other with guns kind.

This is such a case, thanks to a terrible script.Ben Kingsley turns into a younger man, played by Ryan Reynolds, but discovers that the medical facility is nothing short of being a criminal organization. This could be interesting, if only the writers and director knew if this was a drama/mystery or an action movie.Partially the movie could be interesting, to see the conflict of a superficial Ben Kingsley and a caring/loving Ryan Reynolds. But this relationship, or even a battle within one mind, gets shoved away and replaced by mildly entertaining action scenes, terrible acting, plot holes, and a cardboard English villain. The sweet ending and action make this movie entertaining to a certain point, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it is a hollow movie, that fails to build on the relation between Kingsley and Reynolds that should have been there."

" Watch only if you like product placement and weak plots

This may be why the movie had a promising story, but was used to sell stuff most people can easily identify and their brains will then make the connection to buy it. Probably the worst takeaway is that Ryan Reynolds does NOT shine in this role. I figured he's best when he gets to play himself, and this was definitely not written for him, but since he sells tickets, he was cast in a role that requires much more depth than action acrobatics and crying on cue. If you want a better story, better visuals and a much better end, save yourself the 2 hours on Netflix and just watch the original Total Recall. The classics are still the best."
" Inspiration/less
",0.0,0.9933,2018-09-13 00:00:00,5,"I am surprised to see that this dime-a-dozen movie is doing so well among IMDb users, whereas a movie like Cloverfield Paradox, which had its flaws but at least tried to be creative, gets razed to the ground. This movie has a strong premise and there were opportunities aplenty to do something nice with it, but these are sadly underused. Really, watching Self-less is almost like staring at a bulb that won't blossom for two hours.Terminally-ill billionaire Ben Kingsley has all the riches that he worked hard for, but he can barely connect with his daughter and no one is likely to miss him when he is gone. He gets the opportunity to extend his hollow life by transplanting his mind into a custom-made, lab-grown body. Waking up looking like Ryan Reynolds, he initially enjoys his newfound youth, until he starts to get more and more intrusive hallucinations that almost feel like old memories. I can stop here already, because everyone who has seen a few science-fiction movies can guess which direction this is going. This happens in the first 45 minutes, so if this was the only predictable part of the movie, it wouldn't have been so bad. But alas, the rest of the 'surprises' in the film can also be spotted from miles away. Even if the plot itself isn't quite revolutionary or complex, there can still be room to explore the ethical sides of the premise. Movies like Blade Runner became classics due to their subtext, symbolism and philosophical content. Unfortunately, plot usually isn't director Tarsem Singh's strongest point. All the opportunities to do something more with mind transfer, father-daughter issues, and the sacrifice of one human life over another are mainly used to further the undernourished plot, not to bring up a meaningful point. Now even within a formulaic movie that is basically a fill-in-the-blanks exercise, a director can still leave his or her mark with their unique style, whether in production design, photography, mis-en-scene etc. But worse than the lazy writing is that there are hardly any memorable scenes here. The action scenes are of the boring standard Hollywood fare, done without much creativity or inspiration, and only incidentally is there a nice gimmick or idea that works. Director Singh is known for his visual wizardly with which he was able to overcome the lack of strong plotting in films like The Cell, The Fall and Immortals, but somehow he wasn't allowed to bring his usual lush and vibrant style to the table here.Let's hope that Singh's next project will be something where he can release his visual creative energy, because wasting the talents of Michelle Dockery and sir Ben Kingsley without something beautiful to look at is not a good use of his and our time."

He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of ""Hauser's Memory."" Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say ""Hauser's Memory"" but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film.

So at the end when he decides to give his body back to its host and his family I was a bit confused, Kingsley was in Reynolds and some other guy's Reynolds. Kingsley's character gave up experiencing his second life pretty quickly, appears as though he got tired of playing ball and going to clubs. Why didn't he start fresh, living like he always has?

Self/less otherwise stands up in its own right and is reasonably entertaining which is my main yardstick for a film. There are mixed reviews around the normally excellent Ben Kingsley's contribution - personally I couldn't get past his accent. Ryan Reynolds played the part well but not as an ""ex military"" type so possibly miscast here. Apart from trying too hard to tie up the loose ends it was otherwise a good story."

",0.6239,0.9936,2017-09-06 00:00:00,9,"When I read the summary of what this film was about I wasn't too sure this was going to be either my cup of tea, so to speak, or amount to much... how wrong I was! You might think Ryan Reynolds wan't the best choice for the main role of this film.... I disagree - he pulled it off in fine style. There are a few actors who mainly play comedic roles who are actually pretty damn good actors, wasted a lot of the time in the roles in which they end up and Ryan Reynolds is one of those. In the films in which he has played more solid roles, in the main, he has made some very watchable stuff. Sadly, there isn't enough of it... anyway, on to this film in particular.The story-line is certainly one I haven't come across before and as a film buff, I have seen a lot of films, so that is a plus! Matthew Goode was brilliantly creepy as the baddie and did a great job of his role as always. (Why does the baddie always have to be English in American made films? Rather a stereotype! One star off for this, sorry.) The equally wonderful Victor Garber and Ben Kingsley hammed up the business mogul role to a T - love them both. I haven't come across Natalie Martinez much, but she was solid, too as the forlorn wife/widow/mother and Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen will surely be one to look out for in the future if her performance in this film is anything to go by. The film moved at a nice pace with plenty of twists to keep you on your seat. It wasn't predictable and you were never quite sure of the end result until you found it out. I like films like that - so many are predictable and you just sit there waiting for the inevitable end scene... it just depends on how long the film is as to how many interim scenes you get beforehand - I am sure you know what I mean! There was plenty of action in this film to satisfy fans who love that stuff. BUT, what was particularly appealing to me was that it made me think... and quite hard, too. There were some tough moral concepts in this film to get your head around and the solutions not at all clear cut. What would you do if put in such a situation? Hmmm... So, all in all, I would recommend this film as a really good watch, but probably not after you've had a few pints or similar, as you won't get it beyond a certain level of mental fuzziness. Very definitely, this is an underrated film and I sincerely hope that it is one that becomes cult viewing in a few years, because it deserves to be."

I believe a film has a responsibility to be something more than mere entertainment. A porn film is mere entertainment. First off , a film needs some originality of which this film had none. When a film just regurgitates older films it must have something unique. Again, this film had none. The story it self could have been so much more! I want to have to THINK. I want to have to see it 2 or 3 times because it's so intricate I need to. Why cant Hollywood write a screenplay anymore? Look at South Korea for example.

It wasn't that good but also not that bad.A man by the name of Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is dying from cancer and has months to live at best. He opts for a highly experimental option to death which is essentially placing his life into a younger, healthier lifeless body. After being plagued by the memories of his new body, the young Damian (Ryan Reynolds) decides to investigate what he truly got himself into.Although it is not a cloning movie I kept having thoughts of The Sixth Sense. The movie is somewhat creative but not creative enough. It held my attention enough to watch it all the way through but I still had one eye on a book I was reading. There are some chase scenes and a steady peeling away of the onion but nothing groundbreaking."
" Very Under rated Movie
",0.0,0.9827,2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Now I recently watched two movies pretty close together. The first was 'The Girl on a Train', a movie that the critics raved on about. Then I saw this movie 'Self /Less' and to be honest only bought the DVD because it was cheap. Now 'The Girl on a Train' was one of the biggest pieces of cinematic junk I have had the misfortune to watch, whereas this movie 'Self /Less' was a really good movie.The acting was first rate with all the lead roles being done brilliantly. Ben Kingsley was outstanding but both Ryan Reynolds and Natalie Martinez were also really good. Oh and the little girl acting as the daughter (I don't know her name) was wonderful and an actress to watch out for in the future I am sure. The story is a good one and the film moves at a good pace, fast enough to keep you interested but not so fast as to lose the thriller element.I seriously wonder how movie critics and reviewers get and keep their jobs. If a movie says 'Critics are raving about...' I will tend to give that movie a wide birth.As for this under rated movie, it is well worth a watch."
" Save Yourself from Self/Less
",0.4939,0.9762,2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This weird concoction is now showing on HBO (Feb. 2017), and I guess it's technically not free if you divide $15 by the number of movies, TV programs, and specials watched in one month. OK, let's say I paid 50 cents.Sadly, this mess still isn't worth it. And that's too bad because Ben Kingsley always gives a good performance; Ryan Reynolds is quite capable and Tarsem Singh is one of the most visionary directors working today (see his movie, The Fall and his TV show, Emerald City). But as some reviewers have already noted: this sci-fi thriller is not good enough in either department to warrant a recommendation. In fact, it lacks sorely in both so much that it becomes a chore to watch. The science part is silly, which is OK. Good premise fiction is based on some breakthrough with all follow on action required to observe that new reality. But the secretiveness of this bio technology is never explained, especially when anyone can Google it and go right to video explanations and even the creator's house. Plus, what bio-tech firm hires heavily armed henchmen? And why? This is one of many head-scratching details that is never explained.Of course, the ruthless henchmen help propel the action. But as noted above, the thriller part is woefully lacking in excitement. Despite Singh's directorial talents, these all-too familiar shoot and chase, ad nausea scenes inspire yawns instead of tension. In short, there's nothing here to think about, be excited about or care about."
" Great and often emotional action film
",0.6908,0.9875,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I have to completely echo what has been said, just what on earth do so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers expect from a film like this to rate it so bad and moan how it could be so much better etc?. This is a classic and possibly the best example I've seen to say and indicate that we should ignore and disregard the so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers and put more weight onto what the general public movie fans say instead.For me this is probably the best film I've sen in the last year and I've seen loads. And certainly the biggest difference between what so called ""experts"" have said and felt myself.Not to sure on the genre though as it has a bit of everything, action, thriller, drama & even a hint of sci-fi as well as being quite emotional in parts. And either way you see the film going it at least has an ending you cant really find anything to complain about which is a rare thing to see in films these days.The cast and acting is top notch and with the story pretty much of award winning standard I thought. Story is good, flows well and is easy to follow and get into. Though the sci-fi element is slightly unrealistic in today's world, but maybe more realistic in the next 20 years or so.For me, a great film, certainly not less than an 8/10 and came close to giving it a 9. So do yourself a favour, ignore the so called ""professionals"" & ""experts"" for once and watch what is actually a great film."
