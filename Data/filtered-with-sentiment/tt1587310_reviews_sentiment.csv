" Worst movie of 2014
",-0.6249,-0.9636,2021-04-09 00:00:00,3,"I always liked the original Sleeping Beauty, but now, it was ruined by the movie of Maleficent. Even though Angelina Jolie was born for the role of Maleficent, I always felt bad that she's a sympathetic character instead of a villain. The backstory before her wings chopped off was nice and the medieval setting of Scotland looks nice. It's still shameful how they ruined some enjoyable characters: First Prince Phillip becomes a bland character, King Hubert, Lord Duke (Announcer), and Sir Minstrel (lackey) are absent, the 3 Good Fairies (Merryweather, Flora, and Fauna) became idiots and people call them the Three Stooges, and worst of all, King Stefan becomes the villain by taking away his parenting nature and humor (Skumps in the final cut and It Happens I have a Picture from the original cut/demo recording). I consider it the wrong kind of feminism since it did not benefit the idea that everyone is treated equally regardless of what they are. The idea of King Stefan rewritten as a villain is one of the reasons why I will NOT watch this garbage ever again! They treat it as the real story when they're ignoring real facts of the original animated film."
" Terrible remake film
",-0.4767,-0.1747,2021-04-09 00:00:00,1,I have to say I was looking forward to this movie because of original disney movie I watched but I have to say this is nothing like original they ruined maleficent character from making one of bagasse villians to character we care about we want to hate her. Would been interesting to see more backstory.But sadly it fails three good faires are nothing but idiots who doesn't care for aurora who care about saving their own skins. Prince Philip this time around he has zero personality compare to original he bearly appeared.The main villain is worst with zero motivation I dont recommend watching this disney just go back making animation these live actions remakes getting less creatively.
" Great CGI. Great acting. Great Production Values. Horrible Story.
",0.91,-0.7182,2021-04-05 00:00:00,5,"This story made no sense. So the King grew up loving her, couldn't bring himself to kill Maleficent, but was fine with cutting off her wings? What?The King sends his daughter to be protected away from the castle? What? If she was under constant guard, she could've been stopped from walking into the spindle room of doom.So she magically walks towards a room full of broken spindle things, and some mysterious force assembles one so she can prick her finger? WTF?!Her father dies and she mentions nothing of it?Aurora doesn't ask about her mother.At the end, that prince kid just shows up out of no where, wtf?The father shows no love for his daughter at all, wtf?This is some of the worst writing I've seen in a while.Everything else was great though and was the saving grace for the movie, but that script is awful. It ruined what could've been an amazing film."
" Interesting
",0.4019,0.883,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,Angelina jolie ruled the show. Her Acting was quite good . Specially a scene where her wings cut off you will actually fell bad for her character. I will say f@@k old sleeping beauty watch this one. Good and evil all in one character. I enjoyed watching it. Bond between aurora and maleficent is so good and unexpected. Loved it

" Different than I had expected....
",0.0,0.9169,2021-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Having grown up watching the 70s animated version of Sleeping Beauty, my preconception of Maleficent was for her to be evil incarnate. I thought, how on earth are they portraying her as the main character?
Spoiler (although it's an older movie)
Well....I think most of us who loved this movie absolutley sympathized and felt like protecting her when she had her wings torn apart. Then and there, Maleficent won my bleeding heart. This is easily one of my top 5 favorite fantasy films by now. The fantasy scenery is completely magical. Angelina Jolie interpreted both the characters vulnerability and strength perfectly. The plot was exceptional as I could not guess what would happen next when I first saw it. I could see a correlation to real life heartbreak and how we evolve to ""something else"", maybe even a villain, from there.
There are two sides to every story and this is Maleficent's."
" AMAZING MOVIE FOR ALL (NOT ONLY FOR CHILDREN)
",0.5859,0.9838,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I've watched again 2 days ago this movie which is really original, as it tries to explain why the character Maleficent became Evil.This movie is duly well performed by OBVIOUSLY 'Angelina JOLIE' but also, with 'Elle FANNING' (who is a good actress like her sister 'Dakota FANNING'), with good special effects and amazing storyline.Besides, this movie is not intended only for Children but for all the people (including Adults).Congratulations ! Great Movie indeed !"
" Terrible story
",-0.4767,0.0644,2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,We saw the movie years ago in the theatre...I only recently joined IMDB..the story was going nowhere and this was one of the few movies where we walked out of the movie theatre....too boring to stay. We had high hopes but stayed until mid way and left
" ""You're the evilest in the world""
",-0.5423,0.9869,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Perrault's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is easily my favourite Walt Disney adaptation and this film takes up on by far the best character from that delightful animation - the wicked witch ""Maleficent"". It tells us how this true epitome of wickedness was actually quite a good-natured elf until an evil king duped her and stole her wings. Now that had to hurt - not to mention get her a touch irked, so she set out on a vengeful existence culminating in a curse on the young Princess ""Aurora"". As per the novel, the three good fairies take the princess to hide in the forest but the crafty witch tracks them down almost immediately and has some fun manipulating them all as the baby grows to womanhood, at which point this story takes an unexpected turn (from the book too!). The cast are really good in this: Angelina Jolie - in the title role - could have been a bit more menacing, but she is still on good form, as is Sam Riley as her rather kindly sidekick ""Diaval"" whom she changes into whatever she needs to do her bidding. Elle Fanning is just a little bit too ""nice"" (for me, anyway) as ""Aurora"" and Sharlto Copley as the rapidly losing the plot ""King Stefan"" just a bit too hammy but cutie Brenton Thwaites does a half decent English accent as Prince ""Philip"" and the three fairies inject some light-hearted comedy into the proceedings too. The whole thing, though just a wee bit cheesy, is still a really well produced watch with some superb visual effects. Though it looks great, I didn't like the ending, much - but then I always wanted ""Darth Vader"" to win, too..."
" One of the best Disney live action (still) by far
",0.6369,0.9934,2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Something usually criticized at this whole revival era of Disney's classics is the fact that they can be easily (and not fairly) compared to the original ones; in fact, usually these new movies are just a ""copy and paste"" of the classics, making it boring and not original, for example, ""The Lion King (2019)"". On the other hand, these live action movies can be completely new and different, but making it go strongly away from the movie inspiration and goals.It is therefore why I believe Disney is truly messing up at investing in this type of productions, which many of them turn out with horrible critics and miserable box office (sometimes), despise of that, Maleficent (2014) may be the exception of a whole list of disappointments, this movie is visually stunning and innovative with a plot that may regret the original Sleeping Beauty but gladly turning it into an amazing anti hero story instead of your everyday princess tale.Furthermore, Fanning's and Jolie's work is magnificent, they managed to represent the whole idea of their roles just as the classic one, specially it is nice to have an Aurora portrayed by and actress that actually resembles the real (and surprisingly short just like the rest of Disney's princesses) age of the role.
Honorific mention to Sam Riley and his great character, whose personally I'd say is my favorite of the entire movie."
" I love it
",0.6369,0.8126,2020-12-22 00:00:00,9,This movie is magnific. Elle fanning and Angelina Jolie are awesome
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9945,2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,"The plot revolves around 'Sleeping beauty' from the point of view of the Malevolent fairy who, betrayed, is blinded by hatred and a feeling of revenge. The film can entertain two types of audiences, both children and those who have seen the 1959 animation in the past. The story is reimagined under the events of the Brothers Grimm story. Angelina was able to clearly demonstrate the feelings portrayed in Maleficent. His features, screams, looks, laughter, everything was magnificently touching. Watching this film is like discovering the great mystery behind the character's story. The new art brings a new look at Maleficent, King Stefan, Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, the Diaval raven. The story tries to show a world that no one has ever seen, as Angelina Jolie said. The film's plot revolves around a beautiful and naive fairy with penetrating black spoiler wings: Maleficent leads a life of peace in the kingdoms of the Moors, having grown up in this peaceful kingdom; until one day, the humans, seeing the rise of the Moors, decide to exterminate them, threatening the harmony of the region. Maleficent is portrayed, at the same time, as villain and heroine, she being the real Sleeping Beauty, for having her beautiful personality asleep and forgotten in the midst of these new feelings of revenge, bringing an anti-heroine role. The great innovation of 'Maleficent' was the story being told from a point of view that until then was unknown, even giving us several moral lessons, such as being careful with the thirst for revenge, because we can regret it later. spoiler: The film is also innovative in portraying other forms of love, not being attached to the classic imposition of love Eros, between two people of opposite sexes, a characteristic present in the classic Disney fairytale animations. The film is directed by Robert Stromberg, a specialist in visual effects, who left the audience gaping with the effects in 'Maleficent' as well as in 'Alice in Wonderland' or 'Avatar', winning the Oscar for his better work as an art director in these films. The soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard was also magnificent, epic, and related well with the environment of the film. As for the script, written by Linda Woolverton, it is touching, exciting, impressive and lively. The way of portraying events that were not revealed in 'Sleeping beauty' was perfect. The question of '' Why did she cast the curse? '' Has never been well explained, and made us see Maleficent as just a bad, hate-filled witch. However, in this overproduction of Stromberg, the way she was wronged and wants her revenge is revealed from beginning to end.Film reviewed on December 8, 2020."
" Aurora the most useless character.
",-0.4754,0.4601,2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Excellent movie.
However, you actually made me hate Aurora, she is really the one of the most annoying characters in the Disney Universe.
She really dont have any gram of intelligence.
Beside that, its a Good movie."
" Cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty'
",0.7269,0.98,2020-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Not as dark or deep as I was expecting/wanting, but it is cool to see a different telling of 'Sleeping Beauty'.Angelina Jolie fits as the titular character, bringing with her a good performance. Elle Fanning (Aurora), Sharlto Copley (Stefan) and Sam Riley (Diaval) play their respective roles well enough, but neither come close to matching Jolie - as you'd probably expect.I found the special effects a bit iffy. It's not that it looks anything close to bad, I just thought it could've looked better. The score isn't all that memorable, either. I did enjoy how the plot unfolds though, mainly thanks to the lead admittedly.Intrigued to see what the sequel to 'Maleficent' has to offer."
" This is amazing! Definitely one of the best remakes and it's a must watch!!
",0.9114,0.9651,2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,I absolutely loved this. A great take on the Sleeping Beauty tale. The visuals are really mind-blowing. Great acting by Angelina Jolie. I was really surprised seeing the bad reviews from critics. I definitely recommend this movie and it's a must-watch.
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.4767,2020-11-03 00:00:00,2,I was disappointed in ellie fannings appointment to this role.
" A Poignant, Modern and Relevant Adaptation
",0.0,0.9893,2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Unlike the usual Disney remake, this movie has a point. It allows you to rediscover a classic story but with a much more fleshed out antagonist and a touching twist.Those who criticized the movie as feminist drivel missed the point, and I say that as a man who despises clunky feminism for the sake of feminism. The movie is not about feminism, it's about forgiveness and true love. Maleficent does not behave any better with the fairies and Aurora than her valet or the men she flings around.As for the acting, Angelina Jolie carries the film greatly. She performs her role with absolute conviction and puts her soul in it. So does Elle Fanning (Aurora) with unparalleled feistiness and freshness. The chemistry between the two is uplifting and touching.The CGI is a bit overwhelming at times but it adds to the sentimental and fantasy atmosphere of the movie.But most of all, the changes made to the original story are what makes this movie worth watching. Maleficent is no longer a one dimensional villain but a caring creature who was betrayed and attains peace and forgiveness owing to her relationship with her godchild. The evolution of this relationship born in hatred but evolving into caring and ultimately love feels moving and sincere; leading to quite a surprising finale that brings to shame the original outcome of the story. It's no longer about romantic love, it's about humane love. And this concludes my review: this film was a pleasant surprise and a fresh take on an eternal classic. Worth a watch or two!"
" Three aspects attraction in Maleficent
",0.4588,0.8981,2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,"I will introduce ""Maleficent."" It is set on America in 2014. It is named after Mayphith, the villain in the animated film ""Sleeping Beauty"" released in 1959, and retells the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty from Mayptith's perspective. Therefore, it is a illusory- to-life story. There are three aspects discussed are the leading role, special customs and the plot of ""Maleficent.""
Start with, the leading role of the film, Mayptith is the rule of Elf Kingdom. She has met a man, Stephen who was an ordinary person, when she was a child. However, he chooses to betray her,because of his personal power.
In the second place, the special customs of Mayptith is surprised me, because her makeup is so marvel. For example, her head has long horns, and her cheekbones are more prominent than human beings.
Finally, the plot of the movie is also impressed me. I think the Elf Kingdom represents the whole nature. Human beings continue destroy nature for their own benefits, as a result, nature will fight back.
In summary, this movie is thought-provoking story."
" Much better than I expected
",0.4404,0.9859,2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"I was expecting something entertaining with great visual effects, which it has surely delivered. What I didn't expect was the change in the plot. Some people may think it doesn't respect the original, but I think it's a terrific new story. It has a more meaningful moral than the original. It's not just about evil people being punished - it's deeper than that. I even found myself getting teary at some point. For people who don't mind something new, I'd definitely recommend it.Angelina Jolie is stunning and her performance is superb. It was pure enjoyment from start to finish."
" Congrats for great work
",0.8176,0.8516,2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,This movie is brilliant and deserves a way higher rating than it has. The whole character of Maleficent is so intresting and the twist of the original story is really good.
" Good kids movie
",0.4404,0.958,2020-10-14 00:00:00,7,"This movie does a take on sleeping beauty and it's pretty good. It didn't blow me away or anything but it is a good kids movie. The visuals are really good. The fighting looks good, the armor looks good, and even the dragon looks good which isn't easy to pull off. It just felt very polished."
" All star points go to Angelina
",0.0,-0.8736,2020-10-07 00:00:00,3,"My favorite Disney princess, villian, prince, artistic Disney film brought to life~ which no one asked for~ neither did I! I knew it was going to be a disaster~ you.dont.ever.recreate.a.brilliant.classic with realism~ especially when you mess up the whole movie script! The only Part I truly enjoyed was angelinas part. The famous quote ""well well....., oh dear, listen well all of you-"". That scene and her script lines was the only part I enjoyed until they just decided to add useless lines for her. Shes absolutely stunning looking so huge props to her makeup artists!
Gahhhhhhhh they ruined everything about aurora!!!!! Absolute favorite princess doesn't come close to this actress's portrayal! I've seen Disney land character auroras that looked sooo much better and sorry~ prettier than this girl! ""Gold of sunshine in her hair~ lips that shame the red red rose""....nothing that fits that into this random girl! No clothes that resemble her outfit in the cartoon version! Give me SOMETHING that makes me think ""yea that's Aurora""! Her demeanor is nothing like that of the cartoon version! Belle in the realistic version was more alike of her cartoon self than this girl!
Stupid crow part, stupid first kiss, stupid fight with the dragon, and of course the ending is nothing like the cartoon. I was incredibly incredibly dissatisfied that they didn't have the ""once apon a dream"" SINGING in the movie but only in the credits. The most well known song in that movie and they don't put it in~ yea yea yea it's about Maleficent, but at the same time aurora has basically more screen time.
Disney you must be out of ideas for movies that allll you do is make realistic Disney classics into disasters that keep getting worse and worse and worse! Stay out of original Walt Disney's vault and stay in your own lane of creativity~ cuz this ain't it!"
" Well well...
",0.2732,-0.9864,2020-10-06 00:00:00,3,"This is a fresh take on a classic Disney story and it's villain, but that's about where the praise ends.
It's hard to imagine how such a pedestrian effort could have been put into this movie on all accounts from director to make-up; at some point you would have to think, ""Someone had to have realized what was going wrong and said 'stop it!'"" This movie should had so much potential but is just a train wreck.
Its script and writing seemed incredibly lazy for having easy source material to build from. It feels empty and adds nothing but an orgin story and back story that just is low quality filler. This movie should have been PG-13 and faced an identity crisis being marketed for the younger audience.
Angelina Jolie should have been phenomenal in the main role, but her acting is so painstakingly two-dimensional one would almost think she awasn't trying. And it seems it wore off on every actor that played a part in it. At times it felt like watching a poor theater production, with is no gusto behind any acting. This movie is cringy to watch for most of its run time, and won't be remembered by its acting.
CGI is absolutely garbage in action sequences, and creatures made with CGI creates eye sores and nightmares, not because the story is scary, but because they look like they belong in a Guiermo del Torro movie before a Disney movie.
Among how terrible the prosthetic cheeks looked, how bad the lighting on acting stages was, this movie had no sound to it
I'll need to give some slack to Robert Stromberg because it was his directoral debut, but I'm not really sure what he was going for. He should stick to production designer jobs. This movie should have been a cakewalk for a him but he botched it."
" God, I love Maleficent

So I was thrilled to finally watch this and I came to love Maleficent as well!I learned about her story and it really hurt my heart that she was betrayed by the man she loved. She was not an evil villain at all. Maleficent was misunderstood by the audience who only viewed the perspective of King Stefan and Aurora, while she had a reason for the things she did and I'm glad to have found out.Angelina Jolie played her role perfectly and honestly, I was captivated by her beauty throughout. The cinematography is beautiful and the animation and CGI is smooth. I loved it and I think you will too!"
" An Interesting Movie

Angelina Jolie did wonderfully as Maleficent, and it is nice to see the story from Maleficent's point of view. The acting. dialogue, and storytelling of the film are all very entertaining. The bond between Aurora and Maleficent is touching and heartfelt. And I like the dark tone. So overall, this movie is fantastic."

",-0.25,0.9964,2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I'm not a big Angelina Jolie (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") fan, but she definitely nailed the part, and I felt for her when those things happened, so I'm definitely not going to say she's not a good actor.Elle Fanning (""The Great"") is great, mostly an annoyingly happy little thing while she's awake, alongside wonderful supporting cast and gorgeous (and sometimes goofy) CG animated creatures.Disney definitely poured money into this to make it look great. They also spent quite the effort to revitalize the story. After rewatching ""Sleeping Beauty"" and some other variations (I did fail to reread the original story), I am definitely a fan of the direction they took. The original story was just so weak and empty, and this does one of my favorite things and humanizes a villain into an adversery into of an evil monster.I'm not a fan of how or why the 3 faeries get involved, but it makes some sense. And I'm very happy with how they handled the resolution of the curse.They created this awesome world which adds to the movie in a very special way."

" Awful - useless and harmful distorsion of archetypes
",-0.7003,0.8889,2020-07-17 00:00:00,4,"There are stories that embody archetypes and sleeping beauty is one of them. Those stories cannot be distorted because you cannot change archetypes, but Disney (Modern Disney) continues to ignore that. On an unconscious level you feel disturbed by that distorsion and on the long distance, distorted archetypes generates even many issues in society.This story, as all the fairy tales, is about good vs evil, there is no space for ambiguity.Ambiguous characters can be interesting, but if you want To talk about them, then create original stories for them, don't try to change the sacred role of the archetypes in collective unconscious.Walt Disney, the man, would be very disappointed.I give to this movie 4 and not 1 just because of the the good technical part of it and some good acting performances."

" Very poorly written story; Angelina Jolie's acting was excellent, but the rest was poor; great animation and special effects
",0.8126,0.9916,2020-06-25 00:00:00,6,"***SPOILERS***I thought this movie would be excellent. But I was shockingly surprised at how badly the story was written. Here are some examples:-Stefan could have killed Maleficent, but he spared her life. She in return does not return the same kindness and murders him at the end without telling him that her kiss reversed Aurora's curse so he had no reason to be upset anymore. His death was completely needless.-Aurora lives her entire life out in the wild where she was unprotected, when she could have been protected from Maleficent at the castle by the guards. This of course allows for the story's twist to occur (Maleficent develops loves for Aurora so her kiss reverses the curse. And we get a happy ending. But this is complete nonsense. You do not send your baby daughter into the wild away from your castle with hundreds of guards. Nonsense. This is ridiculous.-When Aurora returns to the castle, her father was so dismissive and unloving towards Aurora that it was not believable. She also did not even ask about her mother. It does not make sense that her father does not show any love towards his daughter. This is not believable.Beleficent MURDERS Aurora's father... and Aurora smiles at Beleficent in the end as if her father was not just murdered? This is preposterous.There were a few nice things in this movie:-Angelina Jolie was the saving grace in this film. Her acting was excellent in my opinion. The rest of the cast were flat and immediately forgettable, especially King Stefan who has zero acting ability in this film, and Aurora, whose only good acting was her beautiful smile. They are not worth me looking up their real names.-The twist was nice: we find out the love kiss actually would need to come from Beleficent herself to save Aurora. However, the fact remains that this twist was blatantly and unnaturally FORCED by the story writer Charles Perrault. No King sends their baby daughter to live in the woods near an evil witch with powers where she can have easy access to the child! *Shaking my head*-The final battle was cool. There was a fire-spitting dragon, flying, and overall a cool fight.-Happy ending, except that Aurora's father is murdered in cold blood by Maleficent and Aurora is smiling at Maleficent as if nothing happened. This allows for a FORCED and unnatural happy ending where literally everyone is smiling and is happy.-The animation and special effects were great.Conclusion: outrageously poorly written story with forced events. Angelina Jolie did an excellent job in her role and was the saving grace to this film and the ONLY reason why it is worth a watch - watching her be Maleficent was enjoyable. The main story's twist was good, the final battle was cool and the ending was a happy ending. I will watch the sequel now and hope it is better.6/10"

Morality play value 1/10
Yet another insidious effort by the Hollywood Left, now merely one among several movies, series, etc, to convince our most impressionable citizens that good is not really good at all, evil is actually quite good, and getting along is well, shucks, the only thing that matters. From the overriding theme of white oppression to the ultimate revelation that these satanic creatures are merely trying to defend themselves, few stones are left unturned. We even get a few touches of tree hugging, literally, especially when the giant tree is beating up ""evil white lady"" at the end.
Cleverly packaged as yet ANOTHER re-imagining of an old story (big sigh), the appeal to adults is obviously infectious. What possible harm could come from letting our babies get exposed to alternative interpretations of traditional stories?
""Jesus is just all right with me"" has been replaced with ""Lucifer's ma homey""

" Maleficent malevolently rejuvenates a classic, whilst inducing you into an eternal coma.
",0.0,0.5116,2020-05-27 00:00:00,4,"Much like Lana Del Ray's monotonous rendition of the once melodic ""Once Upon a Dream"", Maleficent herself has endured a radical change of character. Once revered as the ""mistress of all evil"" in the '59 animated classic, now reprised as a sympathetically misunderstood fairy whom attempts to protect herself and her fantastical domain from the neighbouring iron-equipped (seemingly her only weakness) humans. The horned wicked sorceress, now a good-hearted feathery winged fairy. After falling in love with a peasant boy, whom eventually burns off her grandiose wings with iron so that he can ascend the throne, Maleficent rages war against the humans by cursing the king and queen's daughter Aurora which can only be broken by ""true love's kiss"". A notion she believes to be non-existent. Maleficent cares for Aurora from a distance, to ensure the curse is completed upon her sixteenth birthday, and eventually develops maternal affection for the beautiful princess she aptly names ""beasty"". Thus creating a protagonist, and extraordinarily lesser antagonist, simultaneously.Stromberg's fantasy re-imagining of Perrault's original fairy tale, and Disney's animated classic, clearly changes the perspective of its story by altering the motives of its infamous antagonist. Bestowing her the central role and vital mechanism for commencing the 'Sleeping Beauty' plot. Undoubtedly, Maleficent in her gloriously acidic black attire commands every scene thanks to an engrossingly wicked performance from Jolie, whose prosthetic penetrative cheek bones carry the weight of this entire feature. Fully embellishing the original black-hearted nature of her character when re-creating such scenes including her vengeful uninvited appearance to Aurora's christening. ""Well, well..."" she calmly mutters, relishing in her magnificent trademark costume and darkened visuals.Unfortunately, that's as antagonistic as she gets, before Stromberg's complete misdirection confuses her characterisation and implements a tonally jarring mess. Maleficent, unlike her cheek bones, rarely receives strong development. Woolverton's screenplay opting for a tragedy rather than a comedy. Which is adequate, if the tone had matched the tragic nature of the central character. Insubordinate comedy, mostly from the three pixies and Maleficent herself, superimpose a family-friendly aesthetic and consequently diminishes the villainous archetype of Maleficent. Rampantly fluctuating changes of heart for the central character, from raging vengeance to doting motherhood, prevented sustained natural development for the titular fairy, as the script rushes a bloated origin story glazed with narrational exposition before proceeding with the brisk events of 'Sleeping Beauty' (originally a seventy-five minute story now condensed into the forty minute second half of this re-imagining).Jolie ultimately is given nothing substantial to work with, only creating an aesthetically pleasing shell of her character rather than exploring the depths of Maleficent's tragedy. No fault of her own, more so the producers for wanting to implement blatantly artificial digitised visuals to further enhance the overall laziness that plagues this retelling. The fantasy world-building of the Moors is acceptably pleasing, with both flora and fauna exuding imagination. The distracting CGI battle sequences and green screens of fakery however were, well, distractions by definition.The supporting cast were lacklustre, all focussing on their painful British accents rather than their performances. Fanning was flatter than Aurora's personality, whom glaringly breaks one of the pixie's gifts by ""feeling blue"". Copley was one-dimensional and provided minimal threat to his royal character. Thwaites' late inclusion was pointless. And Riley was severely underused. Atleast Staunton, Temple and Manville added some dimensionality to the feature as the pixies, even if it costed the film's tonal consistency. Oh, and the inevitable breaking of Aurora's curse? Terrible. Eye-rolling sentimentality at its worst.Re-imagining a Disney classic by shifting the perspective of its story from the protagonist to the antagonist sounds like an act of courage. A valorous attempt to execute a refreshingly different approach. Whilst this is admirable, the antagonist themselves should not have their entire characterisation altered for the sake of emotional connectivity. It defeats the purpose of this exercise. With that said, despite Jolie's performance, superlative costume designs and Howard's reliable score as always, Maleficent never manages to soar through the clouds with her feathery wings. Instead, grounded by misdirection, characterised confusion and vacuous dialogue."

" A Half-Hearted Jaunted into Well-Trod Territory
",0.0,0.9949,2020-02-27 00:00:00,5,"By this point, we all know that there is a good and a bad way to make a children's movie. There is Wall-E (2008), and there is Boss Baby (2017). Pixar (generally) gets it right, and Illumination can hit or miss. You need to strike a balance. You want to be cute but not juvenile, funny but not slap-stick, and silly while also mature. It can be a difficult balance to get exactly right, with many films leaning too far one way or the other. When creating a film to appeal to children, you must, almost mandatorily, appeal to their parents as well, who are paying for the tickets, buying the popcorn, and driving their child to the movie theater. Maleficent seems to balance on this line in a lackadaisical fashion.Now, this raises a further question: Is Maleficent, in fact, a children's movie? The story itself is obviously much older, going all the way back to the 1300s from Giambattista Basile, who surely didn't intend it to be consumed exclusively by children (hence the casual mentions of sleep-assault (though perhaps that's what children listened to in the 1300s, who am I to say)). The 1959 version has it's elements of mild horror, but overall it would be suitable for most kids, as won't wrack the brains of any adults. The 2014 version, told from the antagonists perspective, maintains that style, and with the PG rating and lack of any blood or curse words, you wouldn't be wrong to take your niece and nephew to see it on the big screen. In my view, this movie appeals largely to children, thus making it a kids movie.So, where does it go wrong? Let's start with the plot line, and the main problem. Unless you've been under a rock for the past 700 years, no spoiler tags should be necessary. The back-stabbing king tricks Maleficent, steals her wings and is rewarded with the throne. Maleficent gets her revenge by cursing his first born, whereupon the lovely young Aurora falls into an unbreakable coma on her 16th birthday, only to be undone by the True Love's Kiss™. In the original story, and in the 1959 animation, this is a problem. In this movie (this is the part where the real spoilers begin), it may as well have not happened at all. It was infuriating to watch the build up of the past 70 minutes culminate in the most basic of triviality. Aurora predictably pricks her finger and falls into her deep sleep, and is there for maybe one hour? Two tops? What was the point? Shortly after falling into her sleep, she is awakened, not by a lovely prince this time, but by the kiss of Maleficent, who has now begun to love Aurora as her own daughter after secretly taking care of her in the magical forest.This reversal of the narrative delivers us two cliches that are as pandering as you can be. Firstly, the person who caused the problem in the first place is the one to solve the problem (see Megamind (2010), Moana (2016), Frozen (2013)). Secondly, perhaps you would call it a reverse-cliche, the true love comes not from a romantic partner, but from familial bonds (again, see Frozen). I guess Disney felt it was their duty to try to disrupt the hegemony of handsome princes by using the same exact major plot point in movies just 6 months apart from one another.These are the types of plot points that children do not care about, or do not understand, but that parents pick up on and leaves them scratching their heads. Of course, their are all the parents who are happy enough to just make their kids smile and leave the theater with neither an opinion nor a memory of what they just watched, but if apathy is the best we can hope for from the adult audience then we aren't really trying very hard. Everyone knows the story of Sleeping Beauty, and everyone knows that the deep-sleep is coming, and to just have some hand-waving to make it disappear makes the whole movie leading up to it seem pointless. This, along with some other rather glaring plot holes and a generally predictable journey makes the story unengaging and boring.The acting is another thing that we need to grapple with here. If one-dimensionality is flat and boring, then the other side of the spectrum must be four-dimensionality, taking it too far. This movie has both. On one side we have Aurora (played by Elle Fanning) who might as well be a mannequin with how much she added to the plot, and the three dim-witted pixies, Flittle, Knotgrass and Thistlewit (played by Lesley Manville, Imelda Staunton, and Juno Temple respectively) who are our three-stooges providing us with banal slap-stick comedy. On the other side is Maleficent (played by Angelina Jolie) and Stefan (played by Sharlto Copley) who provide sometimes convincing performances that go totally off the rails in times of heated emotional moments. Something about the way Jolie screams in furious anger makes me laugh more than it does make me afraid.This movie has every element that will make a film look good on the surface. But we already knew we were going to get that. It's a Disney film, and Disney always knows how to make some acceptable, if not wonderful just with their costume design, animation and scoring. When you release ten films in a calendar year, obviously not every one of them is going to blow you out of the water, and the producers are likely more than happy when a middling film receives a small amount of press acclaim but triples its budget in the box office. And so I once again leave this film thinking, was that it? I yearn for something more because I know what is possible. For every Maleficent, there is Pirates of the Carribean or Toy Story that hits you on all the fronts and is a magical journey for those of any age.I can appreciate when a director and writer choose to take a different approach. Having a film from the point of view of the antagonist wasn't easy until recently (especially with a children's film). And shying away from the frivolous and expected love angle is better than constantly trying to drive home the cliche. However, there is a right way to do it that can leave the audience with something to remember instead of something that is simply inoffensive and easy. I'm not saying I have the magic formula. Perhaps no one does (except Steven Spielberg of course). I haven't seen the sequel yet, it's next on my list now that it's out on Blu-Ray. I don't have high hopes, but I am always happy to have my preconceptions overturned. For now I'll comfort myself with some Jack Sparrow and Mike Wazowski."

" Maleficent is exactly what a family movie and what a reimagining should be: smart, visually impressive, and full of heart
",0.7184,0.9993,2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,"It feels completely ridiculous to put Maleficent in as an 8, along with movies I adore like Nightcrawler, Moon, The Favourite, Sicario, Leave No Trace, and much more, and ahead of 7s like Moonlight (don't kill me!), First Reformed, and even other fun family films like National Treasure or Ice Age 3. I'm making a more conscious effort to rate the movies solely based on what they do for me and independent of my expectations, which are inevitably based on Metacritic scores. And if I throw all the extraneous information out and just think about how satisfied I was with Maleficent, it does deserve an 8, as a great movie.I was already intrigued by the premise and ready to enjoy Maleficent, and throughout the movie I saw pitfalls that I figured the movie would certainly fall into, and I'd think that but to not expect so much. Miraculously, the film was conscious of them and came up with plausible and thoughtful solutions to just about all of them. At its heart, rather than being the same generic cliche messages we see in most Disney movies, I found Maleficent to be a film about greed. Early on, I think they could've leaned even harder into emphasizing Maleficent's love for nature and purity, never knowing any humans and only knowing the wonderful Moors. The plot, while simple, is excellent: she meets a single human and has a great relationship with him, but he ends up having to focus on his human life for a time, and when the king offers a handsome reward for her death, he can't bear to kill her but can't turn down the reward and clips her wings. The complete sense of loss and betrayal she feels with the only person she's ever known makes perfect sense (though I will admit I found her acting in the scene where she awakes to find her wings clipped a weak point in the film). His actions are driven by selfishness, and as that relationship was her only emotional string, she is driven into hatred and rage against him and his people, assuming that all humans are selfish creatures. When she hears he's marrying someone else and having a daughter, what better way to exact revenge on him and take out her jealousy on her than to curse the child? Aurora developing into a wonderful nature-loving girl and Maleficent caring for her and being reminded of her own love for nature was excellent. The scene where they throw mud around with the animals was a highlight. Maleficent's regret and attempt to remove the curse was a nice touch as well. The part I was most concerned about, and what makes Maleficent an 8 for me, is the ending. For one thing, it explains the seemingly arbitrary and bizarre condition on Aurora's curse that true love's kiss would cure it. It makes perfect sense that Maleficent would include that after being betrayed and convinced that true love didn't exist, as if that were true the condition would be tantalizing and devastating for the king. We all know the classic fairy tales end with a kiss from a prince they've barely met, which is a poor message and lazy. Instead, while it was obvious as it came, the kiss from Maleficent to wake Aurora was absolutely heart warming and made perfect sense. Maleficent actually is an ambiguous and well-written character here, clearly flawed but also caring. Jolie does a great job with both the wrathful scenes and the caring, regretful ones. The visuals and cinematography work great for some and not for others, and I fall firmly in the former camp. The film from the outset is unambiguously taking place in a fantasy setting, where a faerie who can manipulate nature is the main character, and I found the CGI Moor scenes to be gorgeous. The shift in coloration as Maleficent is betrayed and her negative energy seeps into all the Moors in darkness and fear was very explicit, and the returning warmth that Aurora brings to Maleficent and the Moors was visually nailed. There are even some interesting themes that weren't at the forefront but were alluded to, including the human propensity to value individual progress over nature and cause climate change, and the strength inherent in what one considers to be their identity. I love Maleficent as a realistic, fascinating character with a great arc, I love her relationship to Aurora, I love the visuals, and I love the pivot from a traditional romance to a deep and nurtured friendship. Maleficent is exactly what a Disney remake can be: smart and mixing the classic tale with modern twists in creative ways. I really hope Mistress of Evil doesn't bring down the major goodwill I have towards these Disney remakes and Maleficent as a character. I will firmly stand up for Maleficent, and as I just put in our hot takes channel, I have it as a top 5 Disney movie of all time (behind Lilo and Stitch, Zootopia, The Lion King, and Mulan)."

Not amazing, it's setup and exposition. The middle however is bland, there isn't a lot of emotional weight and I can't really sympathize with many of the characters. The last 3rd however is amazing, amazing music and a good thrilling battle. If Maleficent wasn't played so well this movie would be ajrd 6, but I am rounding it up to a 7."

",0.7184,0.9728,2019-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Maleficent is richly thematic, reinventing the character for a modern setting with a heartwarming message about motherly love, guilt, and feminism. The film starts rather slow but grows to be more than a simple fantasy story about a well-meaning fairy gone rogue to a good one again. Aside from a few shoddy moments from Sharlto Copley as King Stefan, the acting is superb, led by Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who outshines everything in the movie including the overused and often obvious CGI. Aurora, played by Elle Fanning and the innocent child of the King, provides the emotional base through which she and Maleficent grow as characters. Fanning is a great companion aside Jolie, portraying the innocence and complexity faced by Aurora as she becomes aware of her world and the curse residing within her. The weakness of Maleficent is its sloppy direction and tone. Nevertheless, Maleficent is carried by the empowering themes it explored and the standout acting from the actors.7/10"

It was 2014, the night i saw the trailer for this movie when i should be sleeping because i still had finals, i thought to myself, ""Wow, just when i have been saying that Maleficent is such a great disney villain"". When i saw the movie posters in every cinema that i went, i still did not believe it and after my cousin asked if i wanted to watch it, you guessed it. My curiosity got the best of me. After school ended, i decided to go with her and her friends to finally this movie.As every viewer know by now, this is an adaptation from Sleeping Beauty now mainly focused on its film's antagonist. Disney made an excellent choice on making this a reality as a whole.Let's dive into the Moors, shall we? 🥀The movie begins with Maleficent, a young and bright fairy who lives in a magical realm bordering a human kingdom. She encounters a young scottish peasant boy named Stefan, who she eventually falls in love with. Unfortunately, his love is overshadowed by ambition and as time passes by, both grew distant and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.Over the human side of the border, King Henry soughts out conquer the Moors however he got fatally wounded and during his final moments, he declares that whoever can successfully murder Maleficent, they will be immensely rewarded as his successor and will get to marry his daughter, Princess Leila.Stefan, knowing this, steps foot on the Moors once more and attempts to drug Maleficent making her fall asleep. However, when he had to kill her, he could not bring himself to do it so instead he took lethal iron and removed her wings leaving her devastated when she realizes it the next morning. Consumed by that feeling, she turns the Moors into a dark kingdom and transforms a raven named Diaval to serve her every need.After some time, just as the original goes, Maleficent is informed of a new baby and comes there uninvited where the famous scene of her putting the curse on Princess Aurora. When she has come of age, her soul will be put to rest when she touches her finger on the spindle.After this scene is where the movie takes a whole different turn till its end, in which they play a distinct yet significant approach on the subject of True Love. It's not the typical prince-hovers-over-princess thing, it's much more greater than that. It is the love of a mother ❤Now, it is going to be the main argument among viewers concerning this movie. It is peculiar to ponder about, might as well even cause a ruckus. However, i did like this aspect very much as it is a unique take on the Fairytale genre.This movie was one and a half hour, and also plus seven minutes. It felt long however once again Disney receives its triumph on making dreams come true. The story is extremely touching adorned with marvelous cinematography, CGI, portraying its amazing human and magical worlds as well as beautifully acted with stars that stood out such as Angelina Jolie as the titular character and Sam Riley as her partner in crime, the two go side by side very well seeming like close friends too at some parts instead of a master-servant relationship.Fortunately, i only have one complaint about the movie. The relationship between Stefan and Maleficent could have been deeper to not just widen the narrative, but to give more weight because these two seem pretty shallow everytime they are on screen together.So, in conclusion, Maleficent is a brilliant movie taken to new heights on the Fairytale genre set in this modern world. It may not be as faithful, however as you take a chance and keep your expectations to a minimum, i guarantee it will at least be worth your time and money 😉Thank you for listening, and hope you have a great day 💚"

",0.2023,0.9968,2019-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Maleficent is one of those movies that I would never watch, but my girlfriend love this genre, so I watched it, by having real low expectations. Because of this, I was very surprised, and I actually enjoyed it quite a lot.Technically speaking, I found it stunning, CGI sequences are so amazing and realistic, the Maleficent world is well conceived and people who worked on it put a lot of effort in details: monsters, landscapes and locations are breathtaking. For a while I did not see something so amazing.To complete this live action, you need to have a good cast. Angelina Jolie plays Maleficent, and she is surprisingly good, even in a complete different role that she is used to. She is bad, but at the same time caring and she takes care of Aurora for 16 years, by becoming her Fairy Stepmother, but she can also be bad with people that deserve. An interesting character with a good development. Elle Fanning in this movie does not have the time to express herself, writers did not gave to the Aurora character a lot of space. I love Elle's work as an actress, but this time she was decent, but I know that she can do better, she has demonstrated this in ""Neon Demon"", but not in this movie. Maybe this character had too many limitations, so she couldn't perform as well as she previously did.Maleficent was not was I expecting and the trailer does not give the right idea to the movie. There is a perfect balance."

" An arguably a Halloween movie
",-0.25,0.9895,2019-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of Maleficent, a movie that people don't really believe that it's a Halloween movie, but still, it has the theme, and the vibes of a Halloween-Family movie.Maleficent was directed by Robert Stromberg, and written by Linda Woolverton. And starring Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley.Maleficent is a re-imagination to Disney's infamous classic movie ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Maleficent"" explores the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the classic ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the elements of her betrayal that ultimately turn her pure heart to stone. Driven by revenge and a fierce desire to protect the moors over which she presides, Maleficent cruelly places an irrevocable curse upon the human king's newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Aurora is caught in the middle of the seething conflict between the forest kingdom she has grown to love and the human kingdom that holds her legacy. Maleficent realizes that Aurora may hold the key to peace in the land and is forced to take drastic actions that will change both worlds forever.Sleeping Beauty is one of my all-time favorite animated movie, it was beautifully animated, well-written, so self-aware and of course it has lots of memorable characters, and an iconic and memorable villain, Maleficent.Disney understood very well what does Maleficent mean to everybody, and they decided to make a whole movie to tell us the other-side of the story, which wasn't told before, or was told but from another perspective. Of course the movie has its own differences, some people liked it and some people didn't, but loved it or hated it, Angelina Jolie's magnetic performance is the best thing in this movie, she captured the character very well, she knew what she was doing, and you can tell that she did her best to honor the character, and she definitely did, every scene she was in, it was a blast, and fortunately there's a lot of her in this movie!The movie's main focus is on Maleficent, the movie's called Maleficent anyway, so I don't really understand why people didn't like how the movie didn't care about Aurora aka Sleeping Beauty that much, yeah her character isn't that interesting, she was always being fascinated by anything around her, and you could say that it's cliched, and it is, but still the movie is trying to make you feel and care for Maleficent, not Aurora.What makes the movie also works, is that it's visually appealing, the OST also is really cool. The movie is an eye-feast, it's so chilling!Maleficent is nothing near to a flawless movie, they tried to make its flaws so hidden, by Jolie's amazing performance and the visuals, but if you focus a little, the flaws are really obvious, mainly the cliched changes, I don't say that they're not welcome, but they're still so cliched that you could see what's coming a miles away.The young actors, who played young Stefan and young Maleficent, weren't good, also the creatures design was a little bit annoying... Also the three fairies, I didn't like them at all, and unfortunately, there's a little bit too much of them in this movie!I'll be nitpicking too much if I say that sometimes the direction wasn't great, most of the movie, it was beautiful yeah, Stromberg captured lots of scenes right, but some, not that great though!Maleficent is a good movie, with an outstanding performance by it's lead, still so cliched and kinda uneven sometimes, but it's good to watch it around Halloween times with your family, and it definitely has found its fans, and I'm gladly one of them!I'm gonna give Maleficent a B.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review."

",0.0,0.9737,2019-10-21 00:00:00,4,"So to start why make Maleficent a good guy, the reason we all know and love her is because of her evil and her villainy. Honestly I love Jolie as Maleficent, her costumes are super creepy looking, the things that are wrong with this movie is that Maleficent tries to stop her curse and the worst part her love for aurora breaks the spell not even prince Philip that is such bs. And she doesn't even turn into a dragon, her raven guy-person turns into a dragon. I wanted to see more of Jolie as Maleficent because she is a good Maleficent. But I guess I wanted the movie to be sleeping beauty but through Maleficent's eyes, and they didn't so I'm kind of pissed they turned the greatest villain of all time into someone who's loves and cares. I get it, Disney wanted to make a new Maleficent, a one that loves. And I guess that makes sense, I just hope that Maleficent 2 is gonna be better and that she returns to her evil state. If you like this movie then you can like it as much as you want but, if you haven't seen the movie I wouldn't recommend it."
" Heavy handed message of hate towards men
",-0.5719,0.6498,2019-10-20 00:00:00,1,"On the positive side, this version of Maleficent is visually very nice and Angelina shows she is a very good actress. No amount of visual effects or talent from Angelina Jolie can save this train wreck though, as the whole movie is nothing but a overlong, ridiculously heavy handed effort to beat the viewer over the head with a radical feminist message of hate towards all men. Maleficent is not evil at all you see. For she is female. So she is merely misunderstood and a victim of injustice. For the real evil doers here are the men - the source of all problems, wrongdoings and evil in the world. So all the male characters are portrayed as either evil or useless idiots or both."

The film is usual Disney style with bright colours and a fairy tale story with a happy ending as always so not to surprising there but again its a kids film.I enjoyed it though, there was a few ""Jokes"" in there which are meant for the adult audience while the kids won't understand it, so i found that funny, story made sense, film was fairly paced along which i liked.I look forward to the 2nd film.I watched this film because of the new Maleficent coming out.Age - 25

" Maleficient's review
",0.0,-0.7103,2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Maleficent is a Disney fantasy movie which was released in 2014. It was quite successful, it even gathered the large amount of 758.5 million US dollars. The main character is portrayed by the actress, Angelina Jolie. The movie is based on the classic fairy-tale of Grimm Brothers.
The movie depicts the story of Maleficent, a magical creature who protects the woods. As a young being, she falls in love with a human who later on breaks her heart. That situation is the breaking point not only in the story but also in Maleficient's life and attitude towards life. She turns into a revengeful being, who seeks revenge for her ex-lover betrayal.
When I first watched the movie I was expecting a classic Disney movie in which the princess is the protagonist. However, Maleficient has nothing to do with the typical fairy tale. First of all, the story is told by the point of view of the ""villain"", who never gets the opportunity to express their perspective of the narrative plot. So, it is interesting to see that the villains are not that mean after all, they have reasons for their behaviour. Second, the extraordinary visual effects that are employed throughout the film makes it quite appealing to the eye.
To sum up, I recommend watching this movie without prejudices towards the villains and to get ready to let their minds blow with the incredible special effects and fantastic setting."

" Unique Spin on a Classic

Since those two were childhood friends, he couldn't bring himself to kill her. Yet Maleficent, in a furious rage, puts a curse on the new king's newborn daughter that'll will come true on her 16th birthday, which can only be removed by a kiss from a true love. As the little girl gets older Maleficent began to grow fond of her and tries to remove the curse but even she is unable. Oh No! ;-) Will a true love find her before her sweet 16 and if not, will she ever find true love? A typical fairy tale story but nonetheless, it is magically presented with sweeping special effects and solid acting. This type of role is well-suited for Jolie as her chiseled look is right on. This has a darker atmosphere than most of Disney's movies yet has enough creativity and quirky characters to entertain older children."
" An Unnecessary Fairy Tale About A Fairy Tale
",0.0,0.8382,2019-08-10 00:00:00,4,"Some years ago my daughter watcehd this movie and has always spoken of how good it was. I didn't watch it with her at the time but decided to check it out this morning with some free time that had fallen into my hands. I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed. Everything you would expect Disney to do right Disney did right. The CGI and the animation was quite good. The basic story was creative. The problem was that the story failed to pull me in. It's a fairy tale about a fairy tale. This is obviously based on ""Sleeping Beauty"" and seems to be trying to fill in the story of the evil fairy godmother who cast the spell on the Beauty. It explains what happened to Maleficent (the ""godmother"") and why she responded the way she did. Personally, I've never felt the need for backstories on the evil characters we sometimes come across. I think they're far more fun when they're just delightfully and wickedly evil. Telling us all about Maleficent's past was ike the movie version telling us why the Grinch was such a grinch. To me, it was unnecessary. Creative, yes. As I said - credit for that. But still unnecessary, for me at least. I have to confess that this was one of the few movies I've watched that I didn't make it through to the end with. After the first half hour or so my attention was wandering, and I actually turned it off with about 15 minutes to go. I wasn't even interested enough to see how it all turned out. (4/10)"

One thing that TOTALLY confuses me: after the King's decree, Stefen tells Maleficent he had to warn her. This implies that he cut off her wings to PROTECT her (to convince everyone else that she was dead, so that no one else would kill her). However, when she shows up at Aurora's christening, he doesn't TELL HER THIS; instead, he says ""You weren't wanted."""

SPOILERS
The way aurora was awoken at the end was also very awesome. It would have been kind of cheesy if the prince woke her up with true love's kiss when he'd only met her once. But the love of a mother (sort of) for her daughter was shown beautifully here with a perfect emotional speech by maleficent before the epic battle ending. The dragon fight at the end, and the moment she got her wings back were both amazing. Also when she spinning-burst out of the window in slow motion. She was powerful, angry, vengeful, hateful, and at the same time loving, caring, empathetic and remorseful"

",0.0,0.977,2019-06-04 00:00:00,9,"I came to this film, not liking Disney since the mid-70's, all the re-workings and re-imaginings rubbish. Then there's the politically correct nonsense of the noughties and now. Also I disliked Angelina Jolie with a passion, couldn't act her way out of a brown paper bag. So to be fair I wasn't expecting much if I managed to stay awake throughout it.
Well I will eat my words now, it's freekin' awesome. Everything about it makes you want to watch it again. All the actors and actresses were excellent. The CGI/animation was top draw, the storyline was beautifully told, and the live scenes blended in perfectly with the CGI/animation.There were however two flaws in the film (3 if you include, it was over way too soon). The first flaw has to be there (the secret doorway) but did it have to be so blatantly thrown in there (oh what's this behind that massive blanket draped on the wall, oh its an unlocked door in my locked room). The second flaw should never have been there. The story is about Maleficent (obv.) and Sleeping Beauty, and herein lies the flaw. Elle Fanning is very pretty, no doubt but beauty, no sorry. Of all the beautiful actresses in Hollywood (and there is plenty) they pick a pretty one.

",0.8054,0.9951,2019-05-25 00:00:00,8,"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here."

" An interesting retelling of a classic fairy tale
",0.4019,-0.967,2019-04-04 00:00:00,8,"This live action Disney film shows the story of Sleeping Beauty from the other side; focusing on Maleficent, the 'evil' fairy who cursed her. As the story opens we are told how there are two neighbouring kingdoms; one of greedy humans and another of friendly magical folk. Maleficent is a young fairy who lives in the latter. One day she meets a human boy named Stefan. They become friends but ultimately he comes to see her less and less. The years pass and Maleficent grows up. Then the human king attacks the fairy realm but it thwarted by Maleficent. He promises his kingdom to the man who rids him of Maleficent; Stefan uses her trust to get close to her and then betrays her. He becomes king and has a daughter, named Aurora. On the day of her christening Maleficent places a curse on her... a curse that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. She grows up in the care of three fairies and with Maleficent keeping a watchful eye to ensure nothing happens to her before the curse is due to take effect. Inevitably the day of her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent starts to regret cursing Aurora; will anybody be able to prevent it happening or end it if it does occur?The way the focus of the story is moved to Maleficent is rather fun; she starts off as one of the good people before the act of betrayal leads to bitterness and a desire for revenge. This doesn't mean she comes across as evil or as a real villain. She is shown as a caring character who comes to regret actions made in anger. If there is a real villain of the film it is Stefan; the betrayer who's actions started the curse. There are plenty of exciting moments throughout the film leading up to a finale that should be exciting for children and adults alike... and perhaps a little too scary for some younger viewers. The story ends in a way that should be pleasing for most viewers. The cast is solid with Angelina Jolie standing out as Maleficent; just menacing enough to be seen as dangerous without being evil. The special effects are really impressive; especially the various magical creatures. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those who like new takes on old stories."

The thing about this movie is that there's a twist. Sleeping Beauty does not get rescued by the prince. She gets rescued by someone far more unexpected.

It's fine when someone wants to take something and make a different take of it. But what is the point of this? Ruin all characters, even Maleficent herself?? The fairies are not caring, but hateful and dumb! The prince is useless and their meeting lacks any emotion.. Originally, their meeting in the forest by singing as if a dream come true is one of the best scenes of the original. In a few lines you understand her frustration, and the prince's awe at her beauty! Also, the prince Philip is at the end for some reason. He ""felt"" he needed to be there, but does nothing, and the feelings between them don't exist.The King trusts 3 fairies he has never seen with his newborn daughter for 16 years! He even calls them idiots when Aurora is back. Granted, this version of the King is an idiot himself in every level. A man that found love at a young age, but for NO reason (aside from being ""a man"", whom are ALL greedy by nature, according to this) left because he wanted more, even though he never had anything and should've had it all in Maleficent.Compared to the original, there are more scenes of unknown men being trashed around by CGI than real characters and real plot.The great feeling I had after the original was washed away by the disgust caused by this unnecessary piece of Garbage!!"

But you accepted him back and he drugged you and physically violated you. Moral of the story - men who love you aren't to be trusted if they come crawling back.Now I like that message, there's truth in it. After the physical violation we should have seen immediate, harsh, magic enriched vengeance. But instead we get a thinly veneered, alternative Maleficent/Sleeping Beauty story that's drawn out by pointless attempts at slapstick fairy humour, and more coatings of Disney sugar.Eventually Aurora turns 16 and the tale plays out predictably. And since simple twists to the tale have already been made, the clever true love twist is just as predictable as everything else in this movie.Angelina Jolie was an Executive Producer so when you are paying for your own movie I guess you are entitled to make whatever you want. But in the end this movie was pointless. A waste of Jolie's talents and a waste of the viewers time."

This film isn't clever, it's subversive. Yes, it's visually appealing, but this movie dismisses classic fairytale elements and, instead, replaces them with modern reboot clichés. People who like this movie probably didn't ever like Sleeping Beauty in the first place."
" Not my Malificent
",0.0,0.0413,2018-10-30 00:00:00,5,Despite some great performances from Angelina Jolie and Sharlato Copley (as well as Brenton Thwaites and Elle Fanning) Malificent is sadly a butchering of the classic Disney villain by giving us the she was good all along twist that is played out and fairly lame. The CGI is also awkward and the tone of the film drifts from whimsical to dark to nurturing and it's hard to keep up. All in all the film isn't terrible just not what it could've been and not a what made Malificent herself in the first place.
" Ruined a Classic Villan

The writers took Maleficent and turned a powerful sorcerous into a watered down fairy who was betrayed and bitter. She puts the curse on Aurora as revenge, but ends up being a silent guardian of the child? Developed a motherly love for her? That is not the story! I know true loves kiss from a handsome prince is not in vogue right now, that it's all about girl power and the power of love between ""sisters"", but that's not what this fairy tale is supposed to be about.Maleficent is supposed to be bad. And what is wrong with being a villain? It certainly is a more interesting and memorable character to play. Disney needs to redo this with better writers who can give the character the treatment she deserves."

",0.3182,0.9858,2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I'm sure many reviews on here cast are in either huge fandom or huge dislike for this movie. I will always cherish Sleeping Beauty from my childhood. The animation, and the idea of being a beautiful princess caught hold of my 4 year old heart. 
I would've loved to see a retelling of Sleeping Beauty giving Aurora the depth she deserved. She was portrayed as young, innocent and adorably happy with no scars from being without her mother and having an unraveling father...yet the movie has time constraints. I think a 14th century 16-year old would be somewhere in the middle. Maybe not as grown up as the cartoon, but more adult than the live action. But she was darling. 
I ADORED prince Phillip. I am so excited for the sequel to see his character develop. I loved his line ""I wouldn't feel right kissing her.. we only met once..""
I saw this twice, and easily recognized the theme of consent, and the way it ravages even the strongest woman. But it's not overt and it can be interpreted as only what is shown on the surface. That's what is applaudable. The viewer can see what they want. 
I saw no man-bashing...I saw war and I saw two essential, good and main characters portrayed by men. 
I was sad by how evil Stephan was made out to be.. but he was driven by fear and power.. I mean, it was the Middle Ages, I felt like he was probably the most realistic out of all the characters. The fear and power driving him to madness seemed very Game of Thrones. 
The three good fairies taking care of the baby about breaks my heart. I prefer their cartoon versions so much more! ""2 eggs.. fold in gently."" 
""It's got to have a hole in the bottom! That's for the feet to go through."" 
Great movie, though. Jolie of course, is made to be Maleficent."
" A Precursor to Sleeping Beauty
",0.5859,0.714,2018-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Linda Woolverton has adapted Charles Perrault classic novel 'La Bell au bois dormant' and provides a background for the famous fairy tale. Robert Stromberg directsA beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) has an idyllic life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day when an invading army threatens the harmony of the land. Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal - an act that begins to turn her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's successor (Sharlto Copley) and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora (Elle Fanning). As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom - and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.A colorful cast acting out this very Disneyesque movie is tremendously aided by the production design by Dylan Cole and Gary Freeman and the CGI effects. For a film in this genre it is strong if a bit beyond credible too often. But then it is make-believe....."

She is the one, and only, Mistress of all Evil who was scorned by being the only one not invited to the coronation of Princess Aurora, with knowing nothing but evil, hatred and a willingness to make those who stand against her suffer. This movie however makes her a sensitive victim, a dark fairy with a heart and one who IS NOT evil and was scorned by the man she loved, and who stole her wings. Its dumb.

Alas, at 39, those are the things that make fairy tales exactly that. This tale, touches, even so slightly and delicately at the problems that arise in real life with real feelings, and I think Angelina and Elle Fanning portray it was feels like what could be-in the real world, a mother/stepdaughter relationship. Yes yes, some of the characters (sharlto) motivations aren't fleshed out Ina way that would suit intereats- The adoring crow, the wonderous creatures of the Moor that suffer in silence. All typical fairy tale troupes, but the growth of the main relationship, and the happiness and closure that comes from the final act. That felt like a real, a really real fairy tale. The kind I'm moved to tears over, and the kind I share with my 2 girls and one boy whenever the mood strikes us. Maleficent is a triumph of showing how life can really be, no prince will save the day, and sometimes people hurt people because of the hurt done to them. But, sometimes, forgiveness can blossom into the strongest thing in this world. Honest, TRUE love. I hope some of you enjoyed this movie as much myself and my children have these last few years. It's such a rare glimmer of hope and greatness, and some emotional honesty, all wrapped up in a fairy tale. And what a beautifully filmed glimpse of another world it is.

As it should be.
Jolie got the balance of strength but vulnerable just right. She tries to be evil but it's hard when you are fundamentally good. Hate makes you feel bad. Love makes you feel good, and we all want to feel good. If you haven't seen it do so ASAP. You won't regret it."

Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) slips Sleeping Beauty (Elle Fanning) a roofie and allows a Prince (Brenton Thwaites) to kiss on her while she is asleep and still keep it a family film. Add a spinning wheel, a castle, and a fire breathing dragon and you got the basic story.What Disney did was to retell the classic in such a magnificent way as to make you never want to watch the old one again. Maleficent is our horned fairy who is basically good. Both her and the plot develop levels of complexity that is not the norm for a children's film. There is a role reversal as good and evil blur lines until the point we root for those we had desired to fail in the original tale.Jolie was great in a role seemingly made for her. Elle Fanning would not have been my first choice, but she was sufficient, perhaps over shadowed by Jolie. My favorite line was when Jolie said, ""I don't want children."" Sure you don't, Angelina.There is an underlying theme that perhaps our enemies aren't so evil once we see the world through their eyes. This is a kids film that adults will love. Indeed, I felt like I was eight years old munching on my popcorn, chasing it with Metamucil.The language is G rated. The PG comes from battle scenes and some dark scenes.

" ""Maleficent"" is Not Magnificent, But Worth Seeing
",-0.4717,0.9912,2018-07-01 00:00:00,5,"2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Disney has been around for a long time, bringing us animated classics like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, and Tarzan. Of course, those films were in the 1990s, the ""Disney Renaissance,"" a time when Disney could do no wrong. Disney's newest trick has been to re-tell its classic animated films with a darker touch, as well as in live action, since live action appeals to a larger audience. In 2010, Disney teamed with director Tim Burton to present a re-tooled Alice in Wonderland, which, while a financial success (so much so that a sequel is in the works), was not a critical hit. Maleficent will likely follow the same path as Alice, but I liked Maleficent more. Maleficent is a dark (for Disney), sometimes funny fantasy telling the Sleeping Beauty story from the point of view of its villainess, Maleficent. Is it a new Disney classic? No, but it is entertaining.In this interpretation, Maleficent (played devilishly well by Angelina Jolie) was once a good fairy who became close friends with a human, young Stefan (Sharlto Copley of District 9). Their relationship blossomed through adolescence, when the war between humans and fairies reignited, forcing their lives down separate paths. As they matured, each became a leader in their kingdoms. They met again when the aging human king offered his throne to whoever vanquished Maleficent. Stefan betrayed both Maleficent and the king, leaving her alive, but bitter, while he ascended to the throne.Years later, Maleficent has a chance for revenge when she learns that Stefan is christening his baby daughter, Aurora (played as a teen by Elle Fanning). Maleficent crashes the affair, cursing her to ""fall into a sleep-like state!"" on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. (It's as if Disney is afraid to use the word ""die"" nowadays.) Furious, Stefan tells his guards to burn every spinning wheel and sends Aurora to live in seclusion with three fairies (Lesley Manville, Juno Temple, and the extremely underused Imelda Staunton), who wouldn't look out of place on one of those never-ending Real Housewives TV shows. Since none of these three imbeciles possess the means to properly raise a child, Maleficent is forced to play fairy godmother in order to keep the child alive long enough to meet her demise. The relationships between all the players of this game change and twist as the child grows.Maleficent has many good qualities. Angelina Jolie is a fantastic choice for the role, giving it her all, as always. The cinematography and visuals are astounding, and the action scenes are exciting. The computer-generated creatures are entertaining without resorting to crude jokes or bathroom humor. If the film is nominated for anything, it will be in the effects category.Sadly, other parts of the movie are not as well done. Sharlto Copley is extremely miscast and completely unbelievable as a ruler of this beautiful land, there to yell for the entirety of his time on screen. Elle Fanning plays the role with a little more ditziness than I would have liked, but at least she's not one of those teenagers who are full of angst. No Bella Swan complex here. The three fairies are some of the most annoying creatures ever to come out of a Disney movie. While their brief bickering was funny in the original, here it makes you want to kill them, and not in a love-to-hate way.It was very hard for me to tell the age group for which this film was designed. It has Jolie, who treats the role with the seriousness it deserves, but no adult with half of their brain cells working will find the fairies funny. Also, the prince that Aurora is supposed to fall in love with is a huge throwaway character, only there for a couple of awkwardly scripted scenes. The script is the biggest problem. It switches from good, moderately dark scenes to ""funny"" ones to calm the kids down. The kids in our theater were not scared by this at all. The opening and the climax mirror the previews for the film, but the middle needed some re-writes. No offense to Linda Woolverton (who also wrote Alice in Wonderland) but she should seriously consider finding a writing partner. So far, her writing career has consisted of extremely high-concept ideas that end up being half-baked. All in all, Maleficent is worth seeing and an interesting take on the story, but don't expect anything magical.Rated PG for Sequences of Fantasy Action and Violence, Including Frightening Images"

I am a huge fan of backstory and it was simply amazing to discover how Maleficent became the ""villain"" of Sleeping Beauty.""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" It is impossible to not relate to Maleficent after what Stefan does to her. Who wouldn't want revenge? This movie is amazing because in the original we have no idea why she crashes the christening and curses the child, she just seems pure evil for no reason. Where is the fun or poetry in that?Her chemistry with Aurora was beautiful, I have never seen such an enchanting relationship between two non-related people. She clearly comes to view Aurora as the daughter she never had and who she would have had with Stefan had he not betrayed her. It was so poetic how when she tried to undo the curse while Aurora was sleeping that it wouldn't work because her hatred of Stefan and his family was deeper at the time of the curse than her present love for Aurora is. I was hoping it would be her true love's kiss that broke the spell, that was a stunning twist.It is also beautiful that Stefan is the one who robbed Maleficent of her wings and Aurora, his daughter who she cursed out of spite, is the one who returns her wings and thus her life to her. I loved the crow that she turned into a man and ultimately befriended, that was a magnificent addition. It was so cute how much he cared for Aurora and how loyal he was to his mistress. I like to believe that they ended up together in the end when they are seen soaring through the sky together.Stefan's death is very poetic because he is falling from grace and he tried so hard and sacrificed his former life and love to get atop his glowing pedestal as King. The only thing that struck me as kind of odd was that there were no other fairies who seemed to resemble Maleficent. The rest of them were all lesser creatures and not humanoids. Maybe the rest of them had fled and chose to stay in the shadows of the fairy world when Maleficent took over. And I guess Angelina would have been a scene stealer anyway so they didn't feel like more fairies like her would be necessary.Hands down one of my favorite movies EVER and definitely the best depiction of a Disney ""villain"""

Angelina's performance is incredible; she has to express a complete set of emotions all condensed in the same movie. I particularly like how the story develops and how things turn bitter when you least expect it. I put this movie in the same category of those great fantasy movies such as Willow, The Dark Crystal and Legend. A masterpiece!"

Visually the location and production design was fascinating, but the special effects were mostly fake and didn't blend to the performances which were mostly just standing by with nothing the do and the flying scenes with the fairies looked too fake like an old video game sequence. Angelina wasn't that menacing in Maleficent. She played it very hammy where she was over emphasizing the lines and didn't seem that mean. The story is just as uneven since it wants to be both a retelling of Sleeping Beauty and a brand new story about Maleficent so the main character is both Maleficent and Princess Aurora. They also changed some of the story and it made me not sure if certain parts were supposed to be funny or serious and Maleficent as a character was just as unfocused emotionally. Why couldn't they just retell Sleeping Beauty or tell a prequel of Maleficent instead of combining the two? My mind was feeling like I was watching two movies fused together!"

The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them.Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done?Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras. Good for teenagers or above, but too upsetting for the young kids."

It looks gorgeous, its CGI is top notch and its plot is a great surprise. I didn't believe that I would say this but in my opinion it is true. They've managed to improve the original story, in some ways by even drastically changing it, and the result is simply eye-watering.It's a bit more mature way of telling a tale for children but that doesn't make it any less appealing for them than it is for any adult, or for me.

It turns out that she's a misunderstood wood-dwelling recluse who's just looking for love, but with this film's laughable scripting you won't be buying that for a second. No, this version is a complete waste of time, and you realise that from the outset as it's one of those kid-friendly films absolutely loaded down with CGI: you get CGI flying through CGI landscapes, CGI castles, and CGI fairies and supporting characters. Shoehorned-in battle scenes are supposedly there to keep adults and boys involved but don't, while Angelina Jolie is merely distracting with those contact lenses and prosthetic cheekbones. The meandering storyline goes on and on without getting anywhere, and the unconvincing actors mired in this mess include a wasted Sharlto Copley and a miscast Sam Riley. The end result?

Either this story has no holes or I missed them being hypnotized by beautiful scenery and wonderful effects. Elle Fanning is not as beautiful as her character name tells but she played her role very well, while Angelina Jolie nailed hers. There's no point to further analyze this movie because I have no objections at all and if I start praising its qualities it could take forever. It's simply perfect, maybe even the best Disney feature film so far. Although it's tight race with Pirates.10/10"

She was evil for maybe 5 minutes. Then she turned into savior.I looked at the other reviews and cries about it being misandrist are just hilarious. Similar to when the so called snowflakes see discrimination in all innocent features. The reason that they made her save the princess and didn't let Maleficent to be evil isn't because ""all women are good and all men are bad"", but because it is a Disney movie and they can't let their main character be bad. Too sad. They could show the explanation of why she turned evil but then keep her this way. It would keep the movie close to original and give it a special dynamic. Since the move is a bit too violent for kids it wouldn't be much of a problem.At the same time I like the twist on the ""true love kiss"". Again, not because there is no true love between men and women and only women are capable to love, but because true love is not what you feel for somebody you just saw but somebody you know. Still, even though it is a beautiful message I wish they remained with original.The movie is gorgeous though. Great setting and beautiful scenes. Angelina Jolie's costume is perfect and makes her look like a true Maleficent. Still, the fact that they never made her evil takes a lot away from her acting. She just walks around looking evil. Not really being such.Entertaining movie but a bit disappointing."

Because men are bad. Or just simply useless.All that is right and proper and beautiful in this world is only embodied in woman. All that is sweet and good comes from women. And only from women.

" A Different Take on the Renown Malicious Fairy
",0.0,0.9577,2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"The story of Maleficent is an excellent interpretation on the other side of Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty."" The beginning, her heartbreak, and betrayal by Stefan, really justifies why she curses Aurora in the first place. While watching this movie, I didn't see Maleficent as a villain; I saw her as someone misunderstood. Stefan stole her wings; he broke her heart. But honestly, most of her cute moments with Aurora make her right side shine, especially in the end, when she is the one to awaken Aurora from the sleeping curse, not the Prince. That defies the laws of their fairy tales, but then again, Disney has also made Brave and Frozen which are also different compared to their usual happy endings. This movie overall, it's amazing and a powerful message that a person shouldn't be judged based on what others say."

I don't know what made me hesitant to watch this, Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as Malificent, as did all of the actors/actresses. The portrayal of Aurora's father was a turn as far as a villain. He only had himself to blame. The ""true love's kiss"" was also unexpected. Some of the reviewers compare this to the original animated story, big mistake. You also read too much into the story. If you analyze this fairy tale in such a manner that you find it offensive, how do you enjoy movies at all? Lighten up!

" Eventually the Spell Wears Off...
",0.0,0.9972,2017-05-15 00:00:00,4,"This is one of the few examples of a film that I've really gone back on and changed my mind about. I don't usually pull a complete 180 on my opinion of a film, but this one did it.I love Disney's original SLEEPING BEAUTY from 1959; one of the studio's most gorgeous- looking films with a hypnotic, poetic quality, and a strong villain. When I saw MALEFICENT for the first time, I fell for its spell. I liked that here was a live-action fairy tale movie that WASN'T about big CGI-battles (there's only one small battle at the very beginning). Here was a movie that showed the dark side of fairy tales (even having a subtextual date-rape scene) with a slower pace, more visual-oriented storytelling, and had a Feminist message. Plus I liked Angelina Jolie and her dynamic with her servant Diaval (Sam Riley). I even bought the Blu-Ray.But with each repeat viewing I began to find more flaws in the film. One is the complete destruction of the characters of the three fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather (they change the names to Flittle, Knotgrass, and Thistletwit for some reason, but whatever. It's basically those characters). They are turned into complete idiots. The Nostalgia Critic actually worded it best: it feels as if the screenwriter of this film had a personal vendetta against the creator of those characters. I can understand that in order to make Maleficent seem like the heroine of the story, the movie has to downplay these fairies, but it's pushed much too far. They come off grotesquely stupid and incapable of raising a child. We see almost no interaction between them and Aurora.Speaking of Aurora, Elle Fanning is horribly bland. This is supposed to be the most beautiful princess to ever live, and she offers little in terms of character or personality. Believe it or not, the animated version of the character actually had more screen presence with her ethereal singing voice. Another problem with the story is the pace: there is a 16-year gap in the story where nothing happens. The entire middle act of the film is just Maleficent watching Aurora grow, the two bond, and 16 years pass within the story with little conflict. The film tries hard to compensate for this lack of progression by inserting lots of filler of King Stefan going mad. Even at a mere 88-minute runtime, the film seems dragged out. It's really hard to make a story compelling when the plot literally has to stop and not move forward for 16 years until it can progress.Prince Philip is truly given nothing to do. The movie is trying to go for the same message as FROZEN; the ""true love"" of the story is between two women (in this case a mother and daughter-figure) instead of romance. But while I can appreciate this modern take on the fairy tale narrative, it's just so sloppily done to the point that Philip is a non-character who gets kicked out of the movie. When he shows up again at the very end, it feels like a tacked-on ""Oh yeah, we forgot about him"" moment. FROZEN was much smarter in its subversive take on the genre.The 1959 animated film is not intended to be realistic. It embraces the fact that it's a fairy tale and has all the Hollywood and Disney archetypes of the 1950's. Sure, it wasn't big on character development, but it had some nice magical moments. You could enjoy the whimsy of Aurora and Philip meeting and falling in love, the humor of the three fairies, and the menace of Maleficent. It was a pure fairy tale.But this film, made for a 2014 audience, is slightly harder to pigeon-hole. It's not quite sure if it wants to be a pure fairy tale that throws logic completely to the wind or if it wants to be a more adult, gritty, realistic, and sophisticated take on the story. Once you look beyond the performances of Jolie and Riley, the only two actors in the movie who are actually engaging, you're left with a pretty meh story.By the third time I saw the film, my problems with it were so large that I realized I would probably not be likely to watch it again, and ended up selling the Blu-Ray to someone. And that perfectly sums up MALEFICENT: it casts a spell on you once, but it soon wears off once you start thinking too much."
" Glorifying Bad
",-0.0258,0.8154,2017-04-30 00:00:00,1,"Positive: This film is visually striking ~ stunning cinematography.Cons: Maleficent literally means one who brings harm.There is a sympathy for the devil type theme.The leading character looks extremely sinister with large horns, bat wings, and she is dressed completely in black,she resembles Baphomet. The general public is so brainwashed and desensitized these days that they will not understand that this movie is mocking God by glorifying the Luciferian archetype - how many parents will even realize that what they are putting in front of their children's minds is blatant satanic mind control.The film makers are pushing a satanic Gnostic belief system onto innocent unsuspecting minds. Gnosticism teaches that Lucifer is not bad - this philosophy is an occult inversion of Christian teaching.Early experience has an important influence on adult behaviour.When the children watching this sort of material grow up they will easily accept occult themes because they have sentimental,warm memories of films like this. Disney would never have been able to get away with this a few decades ago,they have always had subliminal messages & occult symbolism woven into their films but now they aren't even bothering to hide it."
" The irony is strong in this one
",0.4767,-0.962,2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"To be fair to this film it is well directed and.. well that's it really. The irony is that this film seems to be a response to claims of sexism directed at previous Disney films but in response they have produced the most sexist film you are ever likely to see. Simply put all the men in this film are portrayed in an unremittingly bad way except for the 'happy slave', because good men do whatever they are told. There is not one good character in this film.The film tries to forgive the actions of the 'evil Maleficent' and this is certainly what the audience is supposed to feel. Her terrible actions are justified by being in response to what is clearly a date rape. But how can her actions be justified when she takes revenge on the child of her attacker? As for the princess herself, she is a paper thin character who seems to forgive Maleficent far too easily after discovering that her father (predictably) doesn't show any love for her (the same father that hid every spinning wheel in the country).The final message of this film is that the only 'true' love is between two women as men are clearly incapable of love even when that is between a father and his daughter. Whatever you do don't get this film for your sons and daughters its 'moral' messages are all bad."
" A Bad Spin-Off That Tries to Humanize a Villain Without Giving them any Developmental Scenes
",-0.8456,0.8331,2017-03-21 00:00:00,3,"Maleficent is a spin-off of the Disney classic 'Sleeping Beauty'. It follows the main villain in an attempt to modernize the entire story. The main goal of the movie appeared to be to humanize the villain, Maleficent. However, the best time to humanize this character was right at the beginning, and it's idea of 'trying' was narrating a generic back story for the character without giving her any dialogue or lines or anything that would make the audience relate to her. The narrator simply told us her characteristics, and that was that. Nobody hears a narrator say ""She was kind"" and thinks ""Oh yeah, I relate to that"". You have to see that kindness on screen the fully understand and relate to it, and there was none of that. So that didn't work, but maybe the rest of the movie is good, after all it is Sleeping Beauty. Other than the rest of the characters, all of whom are bland and uninteresting, the acting was sub-par at best. They were completely over-acted which, again, makes it hard to relate to the characters. The special effects were on and off. Sometimes they were good, sometimes they were terrible, mostly being the latter. And in a movie all about fantasy and magic and basically revolving around CGI, that isn't really a good thing. One thing that I got a kick out of though were the action scenes. They were terrible, mind you, but they were terrible in a funny way. In every single action scene the camera would focus on a character, then quickly zoom in on their face after a moment of hesitation, and it was hilarious. It was like this were a video game where the player was looking for something and they suddenly spotted it, at which point their vision zooms in to get a better idea of what they're looking at. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but you'll know it when you see it. It's so bad, yet it's so funny. Overall Maleficent just sucks. It's just a bad movie. It's kind of funny, but for all the wrong reasons. The characters are so bland robots could've played them and nothing would've changed. The CGI is usually bad, the humanizing attempt was both clear and bad, and the action was downright awful. In the end I suggest you leave this one on the shelf, whatever shelf that may be, and watch something else."

I don't ever want to think about or revisit this movie ever again. But what was really disappointing about this movie was the fact that Maleficent didn't turn into a dragon in this movie.

Instead we see a lot of CGI fire magic and long shots of Jolie performing her usual meaningful but stereotypical expressions. The film lacks the real magical charm like in the Czech fairy tale films of the 60s and 70s, that is unfortunately generally very rare in modern US productions (exception f.e. 'Legend'). But Maleficient is quite cheap CGI Hocus-Pocus and far from being a magical experience that it should be. With that budget, the right script and a fresh acting talent you could make a fantastic movie that would last long in the hearts (f.e. like the original 'Oz'). Has Hollywood definitely forgotten how to create magic apart special effects?"
" A movie that satisfies without surprise or delight.
",-0.2869,0.9356,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"This film basically recounts the old story of Sleeping Beauty from the point of view of the wicked witch, which ends up being transformed into a sympathetic anti-heroine. The lead role is played by Angelina Jolie, who does a very satisfying job in this film. Unfortunately, Elle Fanning is a totally superficial Sleeping Beauty. She is a pretty silly face that appears because it has to appear. But the blame may be on the script rather than the actress. In fact, the script tells an interesting story and is generally good (especially if we realize from the beginning that the film is a reinvention of Charles Perrault's short story) but it also presents ideas and situations that we just can not swallow, like the initial attack on the Maleficent kingdom, with an entire army in line for battle against an enchanted forest. The Roman emperor Nero (or Caligula?) did something similar when he wanted to conquer the ocean and dominate the god Neptune, but we know he was crazy... The movie has several situations that our logic simply does not accept, even with the excuse of magic. Stromberg, the director, did an interesting job, although the film used (and abused) CGI and special effects. The photo is very bright and colorful, sometimes it even looks like an animation.This movie is a good movie to watch with the family. The younger ones will probably like it more than the adults, but the film has something to give to the grown up too, especially in the final half, where the film takes on more dramatic force."

As a father of a 7 month little creature I felt offended watching this movie, where princess Aurora loves her mother and father's assassin: this is not a tale, this is an horror movie! The plot is not just explaining why Maleficent became bad, the plot is completely different from the original Disney's movie... this is a different story! This is not ""sleeping beauty""... this is ""sleeping with the enemy"", where the enemy, from my point of view, is not her family. There is no credible or even interesting character. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life."
