" An action masterpiece.
",0.6249,0.8655,2021-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Actually, I found a lot of substance in this movie. Remember, character development is not just them growing from some vice to some virtue. I feel the movie has a lot more character development and narrative then you give it credit. Yeah, the baseline story is simple as one can be, but the ""show, don't tell"" way of narrating everything reveals a whole new dimension of fluff about the world and its denizens. Its a deep movie wrapped in an awesome explosion of a pie of scrap cars."
" Fantastic visuals, poor story
",0.128,0.2886,2021-03-23 00:00:00,4,"It is visually captivating but the story and acting are mediocre.
Also did anyone else notice all women are divine and victims and men almost all evil?
Even the good guy is good because he's helping the damsels in distress"
" Fanatical ride
",0.0,0.3257,2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,Tom hardy done his perfectly... God damn screenplay and story .... This'll not allow you to turn around few seconds out of your eyes from the screen... Worth to watch...
" One of, if not the worst movie I've ever seen.
",0.5096,-0.293,2021-03-19 00:00:00,4,"This movie is literally so bad.An hour in and still no plot has been developed. No character has been completed. Nothing has happened besides car chases and explosions, AN HOUR INTO THE MOVIE.Jump forward another hour and it's the same thing, nothing has happened.People rating this movie so high probably voted for Biden in the name of ""equality""Update, I hadn't finished the movie while I made this review but after finishing I took away a star(from my already low 5 star review)
Good god this movie was so bad. Completely devoid of plot or character development. One of the worst movies I have ever seen hands down...and people actually go to Hollywood for political advise lol oh God help us all.Silly silly sheep."
" Wow! I'm shocked. 2021. Better late than never.
",0.69,0.8061,2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie blew me away. It took me 6 years to give this masterpiece a chance. I has hesitant at first because I thought to myself why would I watch a film about vehicle and desert. This film proved me wrong as it was more than just what I had thought. The action, combat, setting, story life, characters were top notch. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did."
" Super Boring
",0.3818,-0.3374,2021-03-16 00:00:00,1,Donno just I really didn't like this🙃All I did just keep skipping.
" Crash'em Up
",0.0,0.6597,2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,The visuals in the movie are incredible. I love the dudes on the big poles. The stunts are amazing. Ton of crashes and explosions. Just an all out rage.
" Very entertaining movie.
",0.4927,0.4927,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed it, all the scene setup, charechase, etc is so felt real, its hard to differenciate with the reality."
" Just a too long chase, really.
",0.0,-0.929,2021-03-13 00:00:00,6,"I had high expectations of the movie as I had heard positive stories of it. I had watched the three previous Mad Max movies on the previous week and thought that really almost anything would be better than the awful Thunderdome. Well, certainly the Fury Road wasn't such a flop. I just didn't recognize it as Mad Max anymore, really. It wasn't the dystopian Earth anymore but like a fantasy world in a distant galaxy, a bit like Sin City meets Star Wars meets the Lord of the Rings. In the Road Warrior everything was in a really small scale, but now the tribe of the warboys was living in a gigantic fortress which would be hard to build even with modern technology...To start with, there was an overdoze of special effects. It just makes the world feel not real. It's ok if the action should be ""cartoonish"", but I'm not sure if it was the intention. The plot was also boring, really nothing more than just a looong chase. Actually so long that in the end it was hard to concentrate on it anymore and then all of sudden you realize that ""whoaa did the big boss just died, not sure as I almost fell asleep"".It wasn't as bad as the Thunderdome, though. At points the action really had some balls and in overall the movie was quite ""stylish"". It's a pity that the story itself wasn't up to all the effort that was used to make the chase look like a computer game with steroids. But maybe this is a generational thing..."
" Entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.4939,2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,This movie is not to focus on the story.. Give your brain this time a little break and just enjoy its cinematography and visual effects.. They are mind-blowming..
" Best action
",0.6369,0.8838,2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,No need words one of best graphic beith action .very difficult to make and watch movie like that ..both Tom hardy and partner was amazing .already watched 3 times ..can watch again without doubt.
" Greatest action movie of all time
",0.6369,0.9442,2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Action, a genre that has been the same for ages now, every movie is just like the fast and furious or Marvel. George Miller and his amazing cast and crew made a landmark movie in 2015. Everything from the great acting, amazing cinematography, and insane score all add up to the greatest action movie of all time."
" Worst
",-0.6249,-0.9186,2021-03-06 00:00:00,4,"From far the worst Mad Max ever, bad script no story"
" Great Use Of Their Big Budget
",0.6249,0.7177,2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,The cinematography and use of budget is truly unforgettable! It's not too often we get good movies centered around crazy vehicles they make iconic that are original these days.
" I literally turned this movie off with five minutes left.
",0.0,0.5532,2021-03-03 00:00:00,3,"Yawn. Action action action with much polish. More of the same from George Miller. Mad Max I & II were best, and thereafter best laid to rest. Couldn't even sit through the conclusion. Just couldn't care."
" Feminist propaganda
",-0.25,0.2415,2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,"It was very close for being a great movie. Very little talk, just beautiful action. A woman has a prominent role in this. Totally miscast and unbelievable. Another left hollywood woke movie who destroyed a potential good movie. Apparantly we are not allowed to escape madness nowadays. A movie should give you a escape not a left political statement forcing it down our throats. My suspicion was confermed when I readed that a feminist writer and activist was asked to write the role of the woman in this movie. It makes me sick."
" Witness this masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9623,2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Even if I am fairly late with a review on this movie - what a masterpiece !
So, everything has been covered in the other reviews, I just wanted to point out 2 things : what a waste of water at the end of first scene ! haha. And, imagine waking up in the middle of a wasteland, surrounded by sand and nothingness, with a random dude chained to you (or vice versa),and after being aware of your surroundings you see a bunch of hot chicks washing themselves in the most valuable thing there could be in that situation : water. Man, Id react a bit different. :D
Insane movie, really good script, acting,producing. Simply loved it, even if its the 2nd time i see it since its appearance.
Awesome way to put to shame most action sci fi movies made ever since this aired."
" Action packed!
",0.0,0.4215,2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This is an action packed thrill ride, full of explosions and tense moments. You can really tell the use of practical effects in comparison to visual ones, it also had a killer soundtrack. Everytime I watch this movie I enjoy it, it has amazing rewatchabilty."
" Fast and furious for people who like good movies
",0.1779,0.9747,2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Movie about cars going really fast, but every shot looks like great concept art, and the characters all have great development. Most of the CGI is great, but some is shoddy. I don't really care because it works with the cartoony fun of the action. Don't listen to the soundtrack while driving."
" The only problem with this movie,is that it's a stand alone
",-0.5719,0.7351,2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie has just about everything, great stunts and action scenes. Amazing characters,great actors,and a story that dosen't change or add any unnecessary nonsense."
" Sorry fanboys...
",-0.0772,-0.8481,2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,Just a pile of crap. No storyline besides a post apocalyptic car chase. Some feminist messages. That's it. Nothing more.
" This film is genius.
",0.0,0.7579,2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Even though it's aging now, it still holds up well against some of its competition.Everything from the costume design, to the cars and the cast was very well done.Watched this movie again recently and still enjoyed it as much as I did seeing it the first time."
" Really good!!!
",0.6211,0.9518,2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,"I've heard for years that this is the greatest action movie of all time and while I wouldn't go that far, it is really good. This movie is basically a non stop car chase, with amazing cinematography, good acting, and a decent story in-between.
That said it's really over the top to near ridiculousness (particularly in the beginning) and fairly predictable. Also, while it didn't really affect my enjoyment that much, besides Zoe Kravitz nearly every single actor (even in the background) is white which kinda irked me."
" World does not end that easy; we have to fight and earn what's ours
",-0.6131,0.9482,2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
Mad Max marks a cinematic brilliance that is much more than just an action movie or a movie about the apocalyptic world. It's a movie with much stronger mission and statement. It's one of those movies which excelled because of a very well experienced overall team from direction, editing, writing, sound and visual mixing, and many more. The movie garners the effects making the movie viewing experience very thrilling and nail biting by the technical advances that the movie was able to utilize in the movie. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron both were tremendously very impressive in their roles. It's a pleasantly entertaining movie with some of the action scenes worth watching multiple times.What did not work:
I think one of the things that did not work is the background of the characters. As a first time viewers of Mad Max series, we demand to know little bit more about the lead characters Tom and Charlize although we do know some. We would have been able to related more with these both characters fighting for redemption if only we have some scenes that made us understand their decisions and their reasoning for that.
Final verdict: recommended"
" Action Storytelling
",0.0,0.9698,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a perfect example of how to create story telling and world building without dialogue. There is some conversation in the film but most of the story is told through fighting and high octane action. The film has some flaws with gaze and doesn't really feature non-white actors but besides that it is an excellent film with awesome action, good editing, and a fitting score with brilliant sound design."
" Am I missing something?
",-0.296,0.264,2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"This was laughably bad. Would have been a great b-movie. Very curious as to if a budgeting issue came to light during post-production process? Only because the CGI seen in this film was shamed by that in films released 15 years prior to this ''masterpiece"".However, I'm sincerely glad to learn that the 'comic book guy's' of the world are still frothing at the mouth for whatever crap Charlize Theron is in. But hey, at least she's getting paid! Ms. Theron is an excellent actress, and a humanitarian taboot. After this travesty it is obvious to the viewer that she should dedicate her time, energy and talents to films of substance rather than box office ""hit"" malarkey like ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". A actress of her caliber should not be reduced to this trash. Charlize! You deserve more!Follow me for more blunt, rational, hot takes."
" A Modern-Day Classic
",0.0,0.961,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"The film is something that 20-30 years later will be reflected upon as a masterpiece classic. The picture is freaking flawless. Remember the Starbucks cup from GOT? None of that crap. Every shot of the film reminds me of a Matrix or Terminator -- traditional popcorn flicks that had an originality to them, blowing everything else out of the water.The actors and actresses in this film have SLAYED their roles. Not only is the action great, I can totally feel each of their hurts, pains, and the joys. The film is shot magnificently, but they're not great shots without the acting. This is some of the best acting I've ever seen in movies, and I've watched a lot of them.There's a few reviews here that are baseless. Not only does the action-packed thrill take massive unpredictable turns, the film is massively about a plot centered upon redemption.There's a few also who don't like vehicles, don't like heavy metal, etc. To them, I'll leave it to all the other movies out there that has music from other genres which everyone else is supposed to enjoy to prove the point -- you've got to look past your music and theme preferences. Those are just lame excuses to write off the movie."
" Best Hand-Made Action
",0.6369,0.4003,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"In terms of visuality and handmade action, there is hardly a representative who stands out from the crowd like Fury Road. For this I give four stars. For all the visual and auditory brilliance, however, the story could have been a little more complexly. ""Lets drive through the desert in search of the green land. Exists no longer? Okay, lets drive back."" I mean, come on!"
" High Octane Action Movie
",0.0,0.8669,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"High octane action movie, but a marks off as the story does repeat itslef, giving it a video game feel. Distinct lack of sex for poor Max, ha! A little slow-paced in some areas, but the production, sound design and look are amazing. A truly visual spectacle that needs to be witnessed in Blu-Ray!"
" Accurate
",0.0,0.0,2021-02-05 00:00:00,4,I have lived in Australia for a year and I can confirm that this documentary is quite accurate.
" Great action movie
",0.6249,0.9952,2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Max Mad fury road has a fairly thin plot, and most of the time it's action after action but there is a decent storyline underneath all the action. Visually this movie was a treat to the eyes, the cinematography was stunning. From the landscape to the characters there was so much beauty on screen. The entirety of the film has an orange tint that amplifies the desolate apocalyptic feeling of the landscape. Barren, hopeless, and endless, the Mars-like texture truly sends the viewer to another world as chaos begins. Much credit must go to the set producers, hair & make-up artists and costume designers for their extraordinary work. The use of sound also had a huge impact and seriously added to the impact of the action sequences of which there are many. Something else that had a huge impact was the incredible score. The action on screen was full throttle and the score matched it perfectly. The energy of the music really enhanced the tension of the chase. Performance-wise; Charlie Theron was great, she is physically and emotionally capable, and absolutely kicks ass. Tom Hardy was pretty good, but he was really just there and felt like a support for Furiosa's character. If any supporting character deserves the most praise it would be Hoult. His demonic, half dead creature-like character called Nux was maniacal, but also showed that he has a huge heart. The mix of his craziness and bravery is something else.
Overall, this movie is brilliant; terrific performances, visually appealing and lots of exciting action scenes."
" over hyped
",0.0,0.7359,2021-02-03 00:00:00,3,"8.1 ??????? how ????? it's 7/10 at best , The cinematography and visuals are mindblowing but the story ????? Well : Going from A too B and from B to A ; The end .
+2 points to the cinematography and visuals ."
" Mad Max
",-0.4939,0.9884,2021-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I would have to say this movie's action is really impressive. The music was awesome and the special effects are top-tier. It's a huge thrill ride til the end. What just brings the movie down to me is that the story wasn't that engaging the the second half and I didn't really get to care much about the characters. But if you great action and editing and music, this will be fun for you. If you want a great story and more development from the characters and better performances, you can still enjoy it."
" PURE ACTION AND ADRENALINE!!!
",0.0,0.7672,2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Forgive the capital letters but this film does nothing by halfs. For sheer flat-out, pedal to the metal action this might be the best I've ever seen.
For decades, fans and critics alike have raved about the incredible chase sequence in the second Mel Gibson /George Miller Mad Max movie.
Well this is essentially a chase sequence of the same quality and intensity stretched out over the whole move. I saw this in a cinema with only about 15 other people in the theatre. There were at least 6 moments in the film that led to every single viewer crying out ""WHOAH"" at the top of their voice in disbelief.
If the cinema had been full it would have been like being at a football match.For a movie to have almost no plot whatsoever and still keep you utterly gripped is a very impressive achievement. And it's a sign of how well executed the whole operation is that the few moments of 'acting' are actually genuinely affecting and memorable.So tune in, strap on and for God's sake, turn up the volume. Don't even think about watching this on a phone or a tablet. It doesn't require your intelligence but it does require a big screen!!"
" I don't get it
",0.0,-0.4986,2021-01-30 00:00:00,3,"Why does everyone love this movie? The design, cinematography and action sequences are fantastic, but the storyline is awful (they drive out to the desert, realise that nothing is there, and turn around and comeback!!?). We learn nothing new about Max. And the ending...he drops furiosa back at the place where they pour water onto the dessert, and then walks off???!!! Absolute drivel of a screenplay."

" I was very disappointed
",-0.5256,0.0046,2021-01-25 00:00:00,2,"I read, and heard, great things about this movie. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype. If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it. If you're looking for explosions, violence, and MORE explosions, you HAVE found it. It's too bad they couldn't hide a good story somewhere in it."
" One of the MOST INSANE action films I've ever seen!
",-0.6957,0.9869,2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"George Miller's Mad Max franchise is one of the most well known action franchises. I haven't seen the first three Mad Max films so I cannot comment on them but Mad Max: Fury Road is easily one of the best action films I've seen in my life.Mad Max: Fury Road takes place in a post-apocolyptic wasteland where a woman named Imperator Furiosa rebels against a tyrant named Immortan Joe by taking his five wives with her in order to search for her homeland with the aid of Max Rockatansky.It's very rare for the fourth installment of a franchise to be this good but George Miller managed to do it. What Miller has achieved with Mad Max: Fury Road is nothing short of astounding. What really caught my eye were the visuals and the world Miller created with this film. The scale of the set and the use of oranges, blues and reds make this one of the most visually striking films to ever exist. The costumes and makeup were also some of best I've ever seen. There were so creative and communicated so much about the characters and the world they live in. Seeing a man on a vehicle play a guitar that shoots flames out the top j conveyed to me how ridiculous this film and its fantasy world was. The main appeal of an action film is the action itself and Fury Road set a new bar in terms of that. The film is essentially a 2 hour chase sequence with some of the most jaw-dropping stunts ever filmed. I was completely floored by the crazy vehicle designs and insane stunts. Miller's choice of using practical effects made the action look all the more real and combining that with the visuals made Fury Road a one of a kind experience. One of my biggest regrets is not seeing this in the cinema.In the middle of all the stunning visuals and entertaining action sequences, Miller does give us time to get to know the characters especially Furiosa. She is the heart and soul of the film and as it goes on, Miller peels back the toughness of her character and helps us learn her emotional backstory. She is really the main character of the film and Charlize Theron does a fantastic job playing her. I cannot compare Tom Hardy's portrayal with Mel Gibson's but I think Hardy was a great choice to play Max and he gave a great performance.All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action films made. It's everything an action lover would want in an action film and more. For me, it's up there with the John Wick franchise and The Raid films. Hats off to George Miller and the rest of the team for creating something truly special that will be remembered for a long time."
" Mad Fury: Maximum Road
",-0.7845,-0.4951,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"This may be one of the most metal movies I've ever seen. A dude literally is suspended on a high octane stage driven by post apocalyptic muscle cars spitting fire in front of the 10 foot high speakers while shredding a guitar. What's even more impressive is that they did 99% of this with practical effects and managed to make one of the most balls to the wall action movies in years. This thing is bonkers nuts and it's an absolute riot of a time. Hard recommend for anyone looking for an action packed, adrenaline fueled ride with a dose of solid performances backing it up.So much awesome here. Hard recommend."

It definitely lacks depth, emotions and tension."

not much of a story or the depth and it is ok do not expect to be challenged with any issues advertised on the package - just action and a lot of it and well done and good looking ... not much of acting going on either ... heh"
" One of the best action movies ever made!
",0.6696,0.9869,2021-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I have so much praise for this movie as an action film! It quite frankly is one of the most impressive action movies ever made.With George Miller having directed the original Mad Max Trilogy, he understands what an action movie is all about. 'Mad Max 2' featured a stunning tanker chase sequence that was by far the highlight of that movie. 'Mad Max Fury Road' is almost an entire movie based on that one scene - and it is amazing!! The heart-pounding, adrenaline-fueled action is non-stop with fantastic stunts. Fantastic editing. Fantastic sound. Fantastic photography. Great cinematography. Incredible sets. 'Fury Road' pushes all these boundaries to the limit, and excels with ease. The action sequences are INSANE!! Every scene is meticulously planned - from the camera angles to the execution thereof. The modified vehicles are astonishing. This is unlike any action movie you'll ever see!The antagonist is a true villain in every essence of the word. He is a god-like figure yet pure evil. I didn't find Max to be a strong character, though. Although the titular character, he was overshadowed by Imperator Furiosa - very well portrayed by Charlize Theron. If you haven't seen the previous films, you might not fully understand the Max character. Furiosa, on the other hand, has a much clearer back story and she drives the film with more dominance than Max. Note how all the background actors have perfect physiques. They must have been hand-picked and quite frankly a feast on the eyes!!'Mad Max Fury Road' is pure entertainment. There literally isn't a dull moment from the opening to the climatic finale. I loved it!!"
" Pure popcorn film
",0.0,0.8625,2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,Don't think this movie is anything but entertainment with sub par character development and plot. This is actually my second time watching it and I enjoyed it both times. If you simply want some action movie this is the one for you.
" the most stylish, exiting, and inventive action movie of the decade!
",0.0,0.9825,2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"I am not a big fan of the original ""mad max"" movies just because I prefer martial arts action over car chases but, I decided to watch this movie anyway because i heard really good things about it and it was amazing. Its probably my favorite action movie of the decade besides "" The Raid 2"" here's why: the action basically never stops, the action is stylish and artistic even tough its also crazy and at times brutal, the use of practical effects over CGI, the amazing cinematography and lighting, great costume design and makeup, and that it proved blockbusters can still be actual good movies. all of these things make ""Fury Road"" one of the best action films of all time and by far the best in the series."

Does it have ridiculous and unrealistic fight scenes? Yes but go into this film with the mindset that you are watching a crazy thriller.I believe it takes place in future Australia where water has now become the most important asset in the world - and a future tycoon who has managed to take it out the earth is ruling the people around him with tyranny.Also this is not a feminist film, I just want to get this out there. Yes it does show powerful women, but it does also show good and powerful men. I don't understand the argument that has led to this film being talked about as a male vs female film."

" Mad Max and Furiosa on the Fury Road, a massive chase scene with breathtaking visuals and action you will remember for a life time
",-0.5994,0.9983,2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road is an action movie I go back to every year or every other year, it deserved all 6 Oscars that it got.
What George Miller created was amazing and it will be hard to top it as it might be one of the best action movies in the world and possibly on the list of best movies of the last 15 years.
The story is set in a desert wasteland and the world and civilisation has collapsed as a result of wars and dwindling resources. Fury Road takes place in a that wasteland deep in the apocalypse where War Lords own territory and have created settlements. We follow Max as he's hunted and gets into a chase with the War Boys which serves the main villain, Immortan Joe. Shortly after that we get introduced to Furiousa which is the second main character. Tom Hardy portrays Max and Charlize Theron portrays Furiousa, both gave incredible performances and Tom showed that he was a worthy successor to Mel Gibson. The rest of the cast was also amazing.If you are new to the Mad Max franchise I can tell you right from the start that some things are extreme and some straight up ridiculous. The prequels are more ridiculous, but if you take a look at the world building George Miller and his writers you see how incredible it really is. Let's take an example with the film's villain Immortan Joe and he's played by the same actor that was featured in the first Mad Max, but it's two separate characters and Joe's Citadel and religious leadership is a fascinating and not entirely unrealistic but either way fantastic. There's also a huge attention to detail in the continuity of past films like for example Max's leg injury and iconic car.George Miller is a good screenwriter but I can only judge from the first three Mad Max movies and he wasn't great but that's alright because of his visual storytelling is superior and makes up for the not so good screenplay. The story have always been fascinating and enjoyable though. He's also a great and talented director, his Oscar nomination in Directing indicates that he did something right. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with this picture and he took the action genre to a new height.Sound mixing and sound editing was two categories that won an Oscar, and when you get the chance to experience the movie then you will understand why. Now when I re-watched it for maybe the third or forth time, my first in 4k blu-ray, the Dolby Atmos makes it powerful and the musical score mixed into that, incredible is a word I would use. The music should have earned a nomination as well as it flows so well with the film. The editing won an Oscar, and same with the sound editing and mixing, professional editing which made every scene entertaining and fascinating to watch.
There other wins it got was for production design, makeup and hairstyle also for costumes. It was won fair and square, the whole production was extraordinary.
The cinematography is visually stunning and overall impressive, and one thing I heard a YouTuber talking about which I read about now before writing this review and it was that George Miller told cinematographer John Seale to keep the main actor centered in the screen so that the viewer's eye did not have to search the screen due to the film's fast editing style, and it was done with such perfection.Without spoiling the most entertaining part of the movie, the massive chase scenes and action sequences I'll just say it mildly. It's one of the most stunning, suspenseful and enjoyable action sequences I have seen, it leaves you on the edge of your seat and it's a huge thanks to George Miller and his team that took the choice to make as much as possible practical. I don't know how much is CGI, but I know for a fact that most of what you see on the screen is real. The well choreographed and visually stunning action sequences have made me come back again and again, I won't stop anytime soon."

",0.4939,0.9718,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"A movie worth seen that could only improve if the facial expressions and interpretations of the actors became more... expressive. Also, maybe at some points it lacks stronger lines on the conversations.Nevertheless, in general, unquestionably it passes the message it wanted to: a raw action survival in a post-apocaliptic (or may I say, ""post-climate change""?) earth, where humans have been dehumanized and reduced to instincts in pursuit of survival (that can explain the simplistic expressiveness of the characters at most of the time, but I personally still think they could have been portrayed as decaying humans with feelings at some times). If you want an intelligent action movie, that's not the one, but if you want an exciting, full-of-crazy-on-wheels-action, unstoppable and survival pursuit of dignity, it sure as hell fits it.This way, basically, Mad Max: Fury Road is a diferenciated, strong and exciting story that does not go into the shelf of the best movies or actions movies of all-time (as some might say), but it sure does differs from the common and generally follows its raw plot idea with an creativity and boldness worth seen."

" What a day! What a lovely day!
",0.658,-0.3408,2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,"After a 30-year break, George Miller returned for a fourth entrance of Mad Max franchise. It was quickly hailed as one of the best action films of the 2010s, earning top score reviews from numerous outlets. On an action level Fury Road was fantastic with it being constant thrill race with all its car chases and explosions. The final act was basically The Road Warrior on steriods.Whilst Fury Road was a Mad Max film, the titular character he was a supporting character in his own film. He was literally along for the ride at the beginning of the film. Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa was really the main character. She was the driving force of the plot and the action and Max just helped her. The story of young women escaping being sex slaves gave Fury Road feminist overtones.Whilst it satisfies as an action level the story and screenplay was skeleton thin. It's not a writing masterpiece like some critics have made it out to be.The music by Junkie XL was amazing."

",-0.1018,0.8757,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"I like the Mad Max franchise. Part 1 is interesting. The Road Warrior is a good movie with charm and great action. Beyond Thunderdome isn't as terrible as it's made out to be, but it isn't great... and then we get the overhyped Fury Road.Fury Road has about as much story as The Road Warrior, which is to say: not a lot. Like most of Mad Max since part 2 it is a game of survival in the dessert. That doesn't have to be bad. It has the way over the top bad guys of part 2 as well, but it completely lacks charm and tongue in cheek humor at it's own expense like we got with the goofy side kick or boomerang wielding kid in part 2.
Most of the movie is spent in a seemingly endless vehicle battle with the bad guys being less effective than Storm Troopers, which is my next complaint... the survival odds facing our heroes is zero if it wasn't for the complete incompetence of all the antagonists. There are ways to make seemingly impossible odds turn around, but here there are few unexpected events to explain one miraculous survival after another. At times it almost makes ""2012"" seem like a plausible movie by comparison.The action is very polished, but not very varied and much of it feels like a bad rehash of The Road Warrior but with modern CGI. Sure it is beautiful and stylized almost to the point of ""300"" but it isn't much more and can someone please come up with another goal for WWIII survivor baddies than bedding beautiful girls."

" Hit The Road Max
",0.0,-0.9922,2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road narrates a truck trip for 2 hours. Ok, this description doesn't sound very appealing...What if I told you that this truck is being hunted by crazy fanatic guys guided by a demented leader in a post-apocalyptic desert? Sounds more fun right? The absurd in the movie is always done smartly, Fury Road is an action movie but is deeply poetic and will take you on a journey through its visuals.The plot of Fury Road is basic but logical, solid, and corresponds to a story that takes place in a world devastated by a nuclear war. The point of the movie is the search for hope and redemption in a desert where madness is the norm. Indeed madness has a capital place in Fury Road. Max, one of the main character, is constantly wondering if he is crazy or if it is everyone else.The main characteristic of Fury Road is its action sequences. For some, these scenes are excessively present. In reality, everything is developed around it and I think the action is the essence of the movie. Indeed, Fury Road will thrill you from beginning to end with its high-speed pursuits. George Miller, the director, wished to make a movie using the minimum green screen and the result is mind-blowing. Some stunts in the movie are even performed by cirque du Soleil artists. Like I said before, this movie is absurd but in the right way, everything is designed to make you feel the insanity of the antagonists. Some sequences will probably make you wonder what you're looking at. This includes a suspended blind man playing a flame-throwing guitar on a high-speed vehicle.The other key point of Mad Max: Fury Road is its characters. The hero of this film is not Max like you would think but Furiosa, a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young wives escape from the film's antagonist. She is played by Charlize Theron who has a very impressive acting performance throughout the film. Furiosa is a strong female character with charisma and determination. The spectator can easily become attached to her and her fight for hope.Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the greatest action movies ever put to screen. Action scenes are awesome and breathtaking, characters are badass and the movie itself is mad. Fury Road will make you want to put flame-throwers on your car and drive it around at high speed while listening to metal."

1. The action sequences are awe-inspiring, enthralling, and beautifully choreographed.

3. The quick-cut and fast-paced edits add a lot of adrenaline and intensity to the action scenes.
4. The score is placed strategically and it enforces the appropriate atmosphere, particularly the electric guitar riffing by The Doof Warrior (iOTA).
5. Both Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) and Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky) give great performances.
6. The cinematography is gorgeous which provides a plethora of beautiful shots.
7. The colour palette is stunning and it not only cements the over-the-top nature of the movie, but it also changes to match the goings (e.g. red and orange for the anger, intensity and violence, but blue for calm, hopefulness and sadness).
8. The special effects are brilliant and they only add to the wonder and magic, as well as looking fantastic.Cons:
1. Some of the dialogue is rather cheesy and wooden, especially when it's delivering exposition.
2. The backstory of Max Rockatansky is brought up at randomly jarring intervals, and it's never fleshed out enough or resolved."

I got to say I wasn't particularly excited about the revival of yet another franchise, even though I enjoyed the first three episodes of the post-environmental collapse series made in the 1980's, but when armies of masculinists took to their keyboards to attack this movie with their uninvited comments about a feminist takeover of the series, I sort of had to watch it. So yeah, turns out max is arrested and used as a slave, or as a ""bloodbag"" to transfuse a soldier of a local warlord. Even if it doesn't seem to follow the timeline of the previous episodes, the character is the same, haunted by the ghosts of the people he couldn't save, to the point that he is mostly an antihero, talking only in whispers and awkward short sentences. The main character of the story is furiosa, played by charlize therron, driver of the oil-rig who is going to escape and be purchased for the entire lengh of the movie because it's a road-movie afterall, in order to save the five women of the warlord who didn't want to be ""breeders"" anymore, and trying to reach a safe space, furiosa' home from which she had been abducted as a child, except it turns out hope was a mistake and ""home"" also collapsed. It's a fast-paced action movie in which most of the developped characters are women and likely one of the few that passes the bechdel test, but like most action movie, it seems pretty light on the story, especially the background of the characters, except for max' which are deducted from the previous episodes of the franchise."

The set pieces and stunts are great and all,but i feel like there is more interesting lore to explore here or at least have some character development.
There are no real stakes because you don't care about the people in this movie or what happens to them. All the characters have almost no defining characteristics, emotions or goals. Everyone talks like a child, spitting quotes or in some cases just grunt their way through the movie.
It feels like they were trying to get a PG rating, because all the ""gruesome deaths"" happen off-screen or cut away so fast that you'll miss it in a blink (with one exception of course)Overall it is a good action movie, with emphasis on the action.

The Road Warrior is my personal favorite of the three, with great characters, story and action. And yet, despite how much I like it, it is not even CLOSE to beating out this movie in terms of quality. I'll actually go as far as to call it a milestone for action-movies as a genre. Way too often recently, the action movies feature poorly written heroes, villains and action set pieces, so it was fantastic beyond words to see this masterpiece. The cinematography in this movie is honestly some of the best I've seen all my life. The vastness of the sands and cliffs combined with the blue sky make for some of the most gorgeous shots in any action-movie. The action itself was also mindblowing, with long, wide takes and a fantastic sense of grittiness and realism to every set-piece. The movie also sports great characters with great emotions, backed up by great performances, as well as some top tier worldbuilding.

The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support."

I can't even begin to fathom how George Miller was able to conceive such a stunning environment, let alone bring it to life.
The five minute sandstorm scene (which instantly became one of my favorite movie scenes of all time) had me completely in awe. The combination of colors and explosions and colliding cars simply took my breath away. The night of Fury Road left me similarly breathless.
Most visually mesmerizing movie I have ever seen."

The Black and Chrome version is fantastic, especially the night scenes. You can see the twinkle in the characters' eyes :)The action scenes are enthralling. Except for a few scenes, the entire film has war rigs and monster trucks racing. There are guns, big guns, hand-to-hand combats, motorcycles flying, and a lot more. With all that action, the film (except some of the 2nd act) rarely gives you time to catch your breath.It is not just about the action, though. It carries subtle emotions, meaningful relationships, and the world-building is just perfect. The film tackles some critical themes very well. These include, most importantly, feminism, survivalist, people reduced to objects, power hierarchies, and many more.The score is commendable and complements everything, be it the action sequences or some quiet tender moments.P.S. - I would have given 8/10, but that extra star is for Nux's character (played by Nicholas Hoult)."

",0.6588,0.5947,2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is insanely beautiful, the world created by George Miller and his team is something that, even if it is fiction, is not far removed from what could happen to our society one day and even though some people do not like it and hate it. madness because I have to tell you that madness does not affect the plausibility of the film.I've never seen so much visual narrative in a film and for an action movie it is saying a lot. The photography, the costume, the montage, the practical effects, the performances and the script are just perfect.The pacing of the movie also helps and Miller's direction is exquisite as he knows when to give this marvel of a movie a pause.The only thing I can say is that no matter how much a '' Simple '' movie is, I don't think everyone connects with it and there will be many who have an inexplicable hatred of the movie, giving it 1/10 something that seems absurd to me. I may or may not like a movie but giving mad max 1/10 is a total lack of respect for what is, for me, the best action movie ever."
" One trick pony.
",-0.0516,0.9942,2020-08-28 00:00:00,6,"Mad Max: Fury road has amazing action and a very unique style. Other than that there is very little to appreciate.I don't think there are any good characters. I found it ironic that the wives kept saying ""we are not things"", but the filmmakers just use them as devices to progress the plot. Everything in this film only happens because Furiosa and the wives want to get to the green place. The two most developed characters are Max and Furiosa, neither of them have much about them. Furiosa wants to help the wives and she wants ""redemption"". Max wants to escape the citadel and then he wants to help the wives and Furiosa. Even though I think the characters are very underdeveloped I love the character design it added a lot to the overall look of the film. I know this is not a character movie, it is an action movie with fantastic action, but I am not reviewing the action in the film. I'm reviewing it as a whole.Speaking of the action it was brilliant and executed extremely well. The vehicles that were made for this film are incredible and very original. The vehicle with the man playing a flamethrower guitar is just so cool. All of the stunts are great, except for one when Max jumps onto the bonnet of a vehicle and touches the boiling hot engine and doesn't react at all.The rest of my problems with fury Road are either nitpicks or to do with the writing. There is some really bad dialogue during the slower parts of the film and some really bad jokes during really great moments. To me the writing just seemed lazy. There is a sequence where Furiosa needs to make a deal with a group of people so she can travel through a canyon safely, she is meant to be alone but is secretly sneaking the wives and Max through, one of the pregnant wives begins to have ligament cramps when she has to be silent, the cramps begin to at the most convenient time possible to try create tension and that did not work for me. This scene would have been better by rearranging the shots. If the wife starts to get cramps just as they enter the canyon so when Furiosa stops the vehicle a few minutes later and is making the deal to pass through she is worried that the wife will make noise and give their position. An extra scene didn't even need to be added for this to happen.Mad Max: Fury road is good, but it's not the kind of film I enjoy. I would recommend it as a lot of you will love it but it's not for me."

Hands up confession I prefer Mel Gibson as Max so that had a small impact on my rating. The other area is similar to my thoughts on the second Jack Reacher, the secondary character becomes more important than the titular character, in this case Max.
Max has never been overly chatty but in this film its too little to give his character some real teeth.
Still an amazing addition to the Mad Max family of films."

",0.0,0.9678,2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the first movie in the Mad Max universe since Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, which is the lowest rated Mad Max movie to date, some would even go so far as to say that it is not in the Mad Max canon.This movie is actually not necessarily part of the original canon, but it's not a reboot or anything like that either. It is an independent film, set in the same world, but without reference to the previous films.The film is directed by George Miller, who really knows how to create a real action movie. There is so much action and energy in all the scenes that one is almost completely breathless. But there is also time during the action scenes to create characters who to that extent have their own lives. There is no direct main character, as is the custom in Mad Max movies, but Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult do it wonderfully as Furiosa and Nux. It surprises me that Nux gets so much screentime, but he has a whole story in himself and it's even a beautiful story.But let's be honest. Max (Tom Hardy) who plays wonderfully underplayed because he also knows he's not the main character should actually be dead after just 30 minutes as he's still sitting as a blood bank for Nux. Primarily because Nux lights an emergency flare in a cab filled with fuel. The sparks from the emergency flare should have ignited that fuel so the car had exploded.In short, this film is an absolutely fantastic film, fantastically beautiful and hyperenergic, and they are NOT afraid to go their own way. Full respect for the film, where Max should have died after 30 minutes into its runtime.PS: I join the many who want to see a Furiosa film."

" Strap yourself in for one hell of a ride
",-0.6808,0.9955,2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"This film managed to steal the number one spot in Empire Magazine's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century (so far) list, which is an incredibly hot take, and one filled me with far too much excitement and anticipation going into Fury Road. Although Fury Road sits much lower on my list, it is nonetheless an extraordinary and vibrant piece of cinema.Fury Road is simple in its premise. Charlize Theron finds herself unavoidably having to join forces with Tom Hardy to escape the clutches of a post apocalyptic tyrant. Pretty cool, but not too intense or ground breaking. It was well paced and engaging, without being too complex or intricate. What they managed to do very well was to create a whacky and well conceived post apocalyptic world which was very rich in detail.While the plot of Fury Road doesn't set the world alight in its inherent parts, the way that the plot is executed through the action, score and visuals make this film remarkable. This has to be some of the most original and awe inspiring action I have ever seen. I'm struggling to think of another film that manages to intersperse action with driving, gun fights and hand to hand combat in such a seamless and inventive way. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was so intense, so loud, so bold, so god damn cool. Any lovers of action films will come away from Fury Road feeling very satisfied that's for sure. The high octane and thrilling sequences won't leave anybody disappointed.Solid action alone though isn't enough to garner a score of 9. What elevates Mad Max: Fury Road above the ranks of 'very good action films' and propels it into the echelons of 'fantastic action films' is its visuals. This film really is beautiful to look at. Dominated by desert yellows and browns in its aesthetic, any colour introduced truly pops and creates vivid and eye catching frames. The landscapes and scenery used in the film are so fantastic, and the location scouts/CGI people did a great job of creating the world of Fury Road. What also makes this film so engaging are the costumes and set design. The characters and world are brought to life so boldly and outrageously that there is something to absorb by the gallon in every frame.Mad Max: Fury Road also has an absolutely electric score. I wasn't sure at times if I was watching a film or a rock concert. It seemed ludicrous at first but totally worked with the context of the film, and made the action sequences so energetic and frantic. Fury Road really is one of those films where everything just seems to come together and fit perfectly.Not only is Mad Max Fury Road a very cool action film, its also a highly accomplished piece of cinema. Put those two together and you've got yourself a winner."

George Miller set an ultimate trend of full action and violence followed by a soft story this time. So, lets vroom...From the very beginning, the movie kicks in and sets the viewers to keep their eyes open until the very end. Almost the whole movie is covered by the action that too not just a normal action. Out of the world, rusty modified killer vehicles chasing one another getting the full attention of viewers and making them go wow! A destroyed world and people living in that world are not all same, few rulers - dark and violent, slaves - helpless, dying for water, almost dead world looking for survival.Colors are very intelligently used in the movie. Will not see much of green as making sense of a lifeless theme and a tone of warm and cold colors is used throughout the movie which seems to be very attractive. The creation of a new world may be less effort but wait a minute, here we see not just a new dead world but we see new people some living on hopes, some on their own machine creations. Vehicles will be the favorite to see for most of the viewers that are made up of rare imagination and too much effort to present such things on a big screen. Costumes and makeup of each and every character are terrifyingly best. Scary, attractive, and different. It was a world in itself to experience such characters and watching them with all their cult attires. Camera movements make you feel happily giddy. successful Cinematography is the base that made this action thriller to be successful with the cameras moving up, down, and round and round and round. maybe it was the camera, that experienced the best ride ever. And it was all followed by the editing and many many efforts done in VFX, these are the aspects which made the viewers believe in the movie. The music! Yes! The feeling of the music will make you jump off your seats for sure and a special vehicle in the movie where characters are playing drums at the back and a huge guitar blowing out fire.Mad Max will make you go mad this time.

" A new Masterpiece of Action
",0.6249,-0.9842,2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"When you see this brutal, fast-paced action film, you don't expect director George Miller to make a children's film called ""Happy Feet"". ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is definitely a unique experience of action that has never been seen before.Cool looking characters, interesting colors and a good atmosphere of the apocalypse genre. Tom Hardy proves that he can say more with eyes than anyone else with words. But above all, Charlize Theron's acting as furiosa is outstanding.The fast and brutal action is so well made and cut that the viewer can still see everything. But despite the great action, the interesting looking characters, the great cut and sound, and the acting, the film may have weaknesses. For example the simple and superficial story. There are some holes in the plot.The origin of the characters is also kept secret. But the negative points are overlooked because the action captivates the viewer. In the action genre, I would give the film 9 out of 10 stars. As a film, 8. Ultimately, because of the newly created action, you have to have seen the film at least once in order to have the experience.Of course, this film has 0% cult status or 0% charm in contrast to the old Mad Max films, also by George Miller. However, one should not compare this new film with the old cult film series. Because this film doesn't want to be like the old classics. Fury Road is a completely new style and world of Mad Max."

The story is simple, Max and Furiosa embark on a journey against Immortan Joe. Practically the film does not have much more plot, but this does not work at all against, but allows an organic development of characters and mind-blowing action sequences.
It is easy to notice that the tape is basically constant action, something quite common in a blockbuster, but the difference in 'Mad Max Fury Road' is that the action is used as a narrative resource and has, in addition to this, substance, a reason to develop.
It is admiring that a movie like 'Fury Road' exists today. A tape that does not fail in any way. A commercial film, but with a development and narrative fluidity unrelated to its status. A tape that demonstrates that female characters can be strong without forcing this, unlike many movies today.

As plots go ... it's extremely basic.But that is it ... that's all we know and it's all we find out (except that the green place is gone). There are a lot of MENTIONS of things that never actually get explained AND THIS IS MY PROBLEM.Who is Immortan Joe?
Why does he look like that?
How did he wind up controlling all the water?
Why are they drinking breast milk?
Why are the boys called ""half-lives"" and dressed like skeletons?
Why do they need ""blood bags""?
What is with the silver teeth thing?
What is all this Valhalla, shiny, chrome, what?
Why do they have a vehicle that spits fire with a dude playing electric guitar on it?
How did Furiosa lose her arm?
Who was Furiosa to Joe?
WHO DID KILL THE WORLD? (they keep asking and it never gets answered even a little bit)I had to look it up ... and I hate when movies don't explain things to the point where I have to look them up. That's what is called BAD STORYTELLING.I won't spoil it by telling you what was there but there is SO MUCH CRAZY INFORMATION that the movie just left out to make room for more fighting and chase scenes. This movie is 2 hours long and they couldn't fit any more story into it?Sorry guys ... that's some bad bad writing."
" Overrated, pretentious, exaggerated, 300-ized version of a beloved franchise
",0.4404,0.9833,2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,"When the first Mad Max movie appeared in our country we were overwhelmed by the grit, the tension and the unforgiving story of Max, a vulnerable hero fighting a loosing battle against chaos, anarchy and loss. The curious world of post apocalypse captured our imagination as much as the infinitely cool muscle cars, bikes and leather jackets. We were being introduced to a pop culture phenomenon that was Mad Max. One fully realised after a full blown action spectacle Mad Max 2 appeared soon after. It was Mel, the leather, the tension, the never before seen action - the realism of surreal world that changed action movie forever. And we followed. Then came the 1985 Beyond Thunderdome, cool, but lacking much of what made the previous ones great. We started going back to the first part and appreciating it more and more, learning about how it was filmed, researching into it's ambiguity, its subtle message, its classically trained theater cast. It was cherished as the ultimate victory of creative spirit and inspiration over all other factors.And then, after 30 years (?!) we get another 'sequel'. By the look of it, it was immediately apparent it was a reboot, and one of the worst possible kind. Miller did his homework, he knew what sells these days and he went for that long deserved Oscar. Unfortunately for the franchise and fortunately for him - he made it. He made a 300-ized version of his own franchise pandering to every possible, relevant, audience group - except the diehard fans. Youngsters were happy, political activists were happy, the bored casual moviegoer was happy. Everyone clapped at the emperor pretending they don't see his nakedness. In an era of pretentious art critics who can find meaning in just about anything - his move was, marketing wise, a brilliant one.The film had it all, plenty of CGI, explosions and action everywhere. More action. Strong and independent female character and her sidekick - Max. Even more action and more explosions, a lot of quotable, logo-able overdesigned things everywhere, and even more action. It didn't matter that it made no sense, that it forgot who was it supposed to be about or what happened to the Interceptor few movies ago. It didn't matter that self plagiarism is also plagiarism and that Road Warrior DVD is still available. None of it mattered if there's enough tumbling and twisting and screaming and super cool 3D effect steering wheels coming at you at the theater. Decay was replaced with flaming guitars and Max's human vulnerability mistaken for incompetence. Have I mentioned how over-designed everything was.This was a CGI galore Mad Max didn't deserve to be known for in this generation already overdosed on Marvel and Michael Bay's produce. What is most tragic here is the fact it was G.Miller behind this. It wasn't someone else destroying his legacy as it happened with Star Wars. This was a creative self destruction.I though about giving it a 3 star rating just for the fact there were some practical effects somewhere under all that CGI, computerised, insta-filterised cacophony, but I couldn't make myself do it.Thank you gods for DVD technology. I am rewatching Mad Max trilogy every year since 2015 and I am still unable to decontaminate fully."

",-0.1027,-0.8604,2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"After watching this, umm, movie my first reaction was:""WTF had I just seen?""Seriously, since I still have no real clue what ""Fury Road"" was trying to be. To me, it felt like someone had done some kind of postapocalyptic action flick with a ton of vehicles and guns, then found that it was lacking a certain mystic touch. And after the film was done, they noticed that it desperately needed a good merchandise almost everybody knows and reveres for sales reasons.And so, they slapped the Mad Max label on it.And obviously forgot what Mad Max I and II were all about (III was already something done to capitalize on I and II plus Tina Turner, but still far better than this worst crash scenario).Okay, so there is no real discernible storyline. Or probably too many of them, I don't know since...see above, no clue. All the very good visuals can't overpaint the facts that the action scenes are drawn out too long, the characters having absolutely no depth with the exception of Nux (doesn't this alone tells a lot about the quality of ""Fury Road""?) and the actors themselves are playing their roles like being an autopilot on sedatives.Pro tip: If you have never seen any Mad Max movie, start with ""Fury Road"" and whatever you need to make you feel good. When you are sober again, continue with ""Beyond The Thunderdome"" (III, substances not necessarily needed).
And then enjoy Mad Max I and II.One star for the most innovative and impressive car stereo I have ever seen in my whole life."

Charlize Theron was the director. He was the story's sponsor. He became sweeter, and the best actor became more music.

",-0.4843,0.9802,2020-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Firstly this is not a sequel to the original Mad Max trilogy, it's a standalone movie, set in the Mad Max universe, however I say that loosely as the Mad Max universe in the original trilogy was believable and had credibility whereas this film lacks either.Had this been give a different name so it was not associate with Mad Max, I would have enjoyed it a little bit more, but I felt, like many other reviewers, it was an insult to the original trilogy and there were aspects of it that made me feel quite angry about this. But leaving the original trilogy behind for a moment and regarding this film as a film in its own right, I thought it was OK, a no brainer, an action film with minimal plot depth, poor acting and ridiculous un realistic and very farfetched action sequences that have had far too much money thrown at them. In summary it's an ok film to watch to kill a couple of hours.I really like Tom Hardy as an actor and I like most of his films, but I felt he was the wrong actor to play Max, he just didn't portray Max as he should have been portrayed. Far too much shallow Hollywood action hero.Also, the girls in this film are ridiculous given the setting. Yes they're very beautiful and glamorous, but I do not believe there would be women looking the way they do an a post-apocalyptic community in the middle of the desert! The pearly white perfect teeth always amuses me; the post-apocalyptic wastelands obviously boast at least one private dental clinic!As many others have stated, I do not get how this movie has scored so highly on IMDB and is considered a masterpiece. I can only think this is down to the audience's likely demographic; teenage American males.This is not a film I would bother to watch a second time, unlike the originals I've enjoyed over and over again. If you want the true Mad Max experience and to watch real masterpieces, go and watch Mad Max & Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior."

However, I am also the patient of the clashes of ideas interspersed with the dialogues between the characters and the lines that intend to push people to think. Perfect lines, perfect visual feast.The dislike of the movie; they have made it clear that there will be another movie following this movie. If they tied the end more smoothly, the next movie would be a bit of a surprise to us. In addition, those who do not like the action are right on some issues. If the action was slightly reduced and the story was given a little more intensity, it could be a movie that everyone would love.I think the crazy Max movies are the movies with Mel Gibson. Especially, considering the dates when the previous films were shot, it was better that the new movie came so long after. Still, one wants to see Mel Gibson on one side and corner of the film. Coming to the movie, Tom Hardy did his part and filled Mel Gibson very well. (But their conversation is very little). An action-packed movie from start to finish. The subject is the same as the other movies, almost the follow-up throughout the movie.The film also touches on how the capitalist system made people slaves for themselves. Is there a slavery system this time? Slavery in this time; is modern slavery. By making people think that they are not slaves; directing people to the thought you want, employing people for very low wages etc ..."

" It's not The Godfather guys. So stop treating it like it is.
",0.0018,0.9661,2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"This movie is good. Simple as that, people who are looking for Shawshank redemption (which happens to be my favorite movie of all time) in this clear mindless action film, are only hurting themselves. The point of this film is that it's supposed to be mindless action. Max helps furiosa get some women to safety while being chased by a cult of monster truck loving, Valhalla worshipping, crazy people in and apocalyptic desert. It's not gonna have philosophical moments of what it means to be human, or amazing changes in heart. The movie is good because of three reasons, great main characters, amazing visuals and interesting action sequences.
The characters all have a reason to do this. Max helps because he has no where to go but forward, they helped him so he'll help back. Eventually coming to kinda care about their cause. Furiosa, angered by her forced labor and evil captor seeks to help five women leave their abusive master. And a brainwashed boy comes to realize that his ""savior"" isn't really all he had thought. They have a reason to do something, not some BS philosophical mission.
The visuals are excellent, (I watched both the original and the silver and chrome edition. In which the movie is in back and white. I heavily suggest you skip the black and white version, as, although benign good, loses some of the magnificent color and graphics of the regular version.) The visuals bring out an excellent feel to the wild apocalypse.
The action is also excellent. Outrageous yes, but look at the ones perpetrating it. Crazy, brainwashed, idiots with no regard for personal safety. Of course the actions sequences will be weird and outrageous. They at least are interesting and cool. The aesthetic to the cars and guns and suits is all unique and interesting.Those who hate this movie for being wild, outrageous and lack of depth aren't watching it for what it is. A visually stunning, outrageously wild and uniquely interesting action movie. It's not going to be The Godfather."

Tom Hardy's accent seems to roam across three continents for no discernible reason throughout, changing nationality from line to line and scene to scene on a whim. The dialogue is to all intents and purposes non-existent, certainly overwhelmingly unnecessary, consisting primarily of people pointing and screaming things like ""I'M GOING OVER THERE NOW!""Having said all that, and excusing the gaudy overabundance of CGI, I will say some of the action scenes are handled well, with a few good set-pieces and the occasional spot of successful tension-building thrown in.

For me, car chases are the low point of any action movie and half of the time, I am tempted fast-forward to the ""good parts"". Sounds like I'd be in for a most disappointing movie experience with this movie, since Fury Road is more or less a two hour car chase. Boy was I wrong. I can't recall when was the last time I was so enthralled with the relentless on-screen action. What I especially like about the movie, is that while battle fatigue is always a concern with heavier action movies and could easily set in even within a few minutes in lesser movies, but not this time, as George Miller manages to keep things constantly fresh, interesting and exciting throughout this relentless two hour chase. Not only that, but he also manages to rev up the engine ever so slightly throughout the movie, that even though the action already starts on high speed, it just keeps gathering more speed right until the very end. As for the the car chase, apparently most other action movies just don't know how to do a proper car chase but finally someone has done it right. While other movies have iconic action scenes, this movie is just one colossal action scene from start to finish. An absolutely towering achievement in the genre of action movies, I hope this movie will shine a path for many like-minded movies to come."

",-0.296,0.8481,2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"Road Warrior was an intelligent film that had great action sequences in it.
This was one long car chase with a flimsy story around it.
The reason for the car chase was silly. The man playing guitar was silly. Then they turned around and went back where they came from. Silly."
" Ironic Sequence
",-0.128,-0.7356,2020-04-14 00:00:00,4,There is nothing to see here. I have seen the entire film and the strategy of it is nothing more obvious. You'll be sitting and see nothing more of people riding on gruesome and gory looking vehicles going from point A to point B in a boring action packed movie. It's lazy and not creative.
" George Miller brings us the fourth Mad Max film - Ultimate Carmageddon!
",-0.5411,-0.9336,2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.George Miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Josh Helman and Nathan Jones. Music is by Tom Holkenborg and cinematography by John Seale.Well it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth Mad Max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. Undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares.Hundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. There's some narative stabs at redemptive force between Furiosa (Theron excellent) and Max (Hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as Miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.A petrol head's love poem in live action form and an action junkie's wet dream, Mad Max is back, and this time there's also a glorious female side-kick of considerable tough substance. 9/10"

George Miller reinvigorates the series that he started back in 1979, if you've never seen the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior, or even Beyond Thunderdome which is probably the weakest entry in the series, but a favorite nonetheless. Stop what your doing, go watch these masterpieces staring the legendary actor Mel Gibson, It will tell you the complete backstory of who Max Rockatansky was, before he became the survivor warrior that he is. I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy's and was stoked, when he was cast in role of Max, he brings a new and fresh take on the character. I've really missed the character of Mad Max, weather it's Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy in the role, it's feels so good to see the character kick ass, in a world without rules or governments, where survival is king. This film truly lives up to those that came before, and what is yet to come. If your a huge fan of the franchise see it you won't be disappointed!!!!. 10/10."
" Powerful women

Maybe she looks ordinary when she settles down, but that is just because she is peaceful, it does not mean that she is unable to deal with this world. If she is really put in a difficult position, a woman who is determined to use her power may be stronger than a man. Because she can devote herself to ecstasy. Good drama, recommended!"

" Infinitely Rewatchable Action
",0.0,-0.6908,2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"After my third viewing of Mad Max: Fury Road, I decided that it's only fair that I give it a written review. I don't often watch a movie multiple times like that. And when I do, I am often disappointed at how the emotions or the spectacles lose their edge a little bit. But with this movie, I still got goosebumps watching those precarious, mad action sequences in the beautiful barren desert landscape.Every single aspect in Mad Mad: Fury Road is screwed in so tight that the tension never drops from scene 1. The story is simple but compelling with lots of high stakes. The characters are also simple but the nuanced acting, especially from Charlize Theron's Furiosa, keep them from being standard cookie cutter action heroes. These action scenes seem to have been written with each characters' personalities in mind, and that's why they are so memorable.For example Furiosa is the ingenious one who comes up with plans and coordinates things. I can't imagine Max doing the set pieces that she does. He's the one who fights in close range with raw power, and the scenes for him are truly meant only for him. In this way, the action scenes can illustrate character and advance the narrative, instead of just being cool filler in between plot points. That's how a non-stop guzzoline fueled rampaging with metal music can be sustainable for 2 hours.This movie might be one of those rare ones that are just infinitely rewatchable. It's like a visual roller coaster. I can come back to it year after year and still expect it to be thrilling and fun. No other spectacle can match the physicality of the actual stunts with actual cars."

" Great reboot
",0.6249,0.9447,2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a great reboot that's action packed and visually stunning throughout. Tom Hardy is great as Mad Max and Charlize Theron is incredible. Nicholas Hoult is also great. It's extremely well paced and the music by Junkie XL is amazing. George Miller's direction is incredible and the action sequences are superb, helped by the extensive use of practical effects. However, its brought down slightly by some weak CG."
" This is George Miller's gorgeous and demented post-apocalyptic masterpiece.
",0.8442,0.9676,2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"With a plot that is essentially a long chase that goes forwards then backwards, it's a credit to Miller and his co-writers that the story contains such strong characterisation and thematic depth to flesh out the stunning world of Max.It's a wasteland detailed in lush gold and orange, deserted but for the sand and the gasoline craving communities that are controlled by tyrannical warlords. We are far into the future, a place of unnatural worship and invention; a desolate place characterised by its wild people, their eccentric personalities, and their creative attention to costume and vehicle design.Everything is manic, and it embraces the insanity to wonderful effect. Whether its a guitar-flamethrower hybrid that sublimely fits into the blistering score, or the chrome spray that sends Warboys into a high in their final moments, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has an astonishing amount of world-building that is as bizarre as it is engrossing.There's enough narrative heft to bulk the frame of this action film, but its the carnage that is the true highlight. Coming in waves and lasting for lengthy periods, George Miller masterfully directs every set-piece that meticulously guides your eye through each frame. Every second is deliberately and expertly crafted to create tension as the action unfolds. And the carnage is full of breathtaking stunts and vehicular explosions that are all edited for maximum entertainment, with time slowing to afford the time to witness vehicles crash and splinter in a whirlwind of chrome and rust.Packed with well-choreographed set-pieces, impressive world-building and a delirious sense of unrestrained fun, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a fully realised post-apocalyptic blockbuster that is one of the greatest action films of all time."
" Spectacular Dystopian Action Film
",0.0,0.9936,2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Well folks, here it is. My second ever 10/10 film. I love so much about this film it's hard to even describe, from how Hardy shows emotions and feelings without even speaking a word for the first half over. I loved the cinematography, there is a scene where the characters are driving toward a gigantic sandstorm and it is so beautiful. The actions scenes are basically unparalleled, the costume design and sound is amazing. From my knowledge this film is a continuation of the previous 3 films, and the fact that this both continues on that but also opens it up completely to new audiences is amazing. I absolutely loved this movie, I especially loved the colour pallet changes, at day time the desert is orange tinted and you can almost feel how incredibly dry and terrible it is. However at night the movie turns to a dark blue, showing the beauty that exists in it. I loved this film, I don't really know what else to say. It's a movie you can either watch and look for the hidden meaning, or you can just turn your brain off. One last thing I loved was the fact that Hardy is not some sort of messiah character, he just kind of is there. This makes me want to watch the older movies, and I just might do that at some point. Watch. This. Movie. You will not be bored."

The director uses the camera, special effects and acting to tell a coherent story of despair, destruction, and madness with epic visuals and action sequences.For me, it was almost unbelievable to witness one of the greatest movies ever on a regular Wednesday in a crowded local movie theater.

Tom Hardy is perfectly cast he is one of the only actors of the 21st century who could play Max just as well as Mel Gibson. Even though it is basically just one long car chase it is exceptional how George Miller could create such epic vehicles and somehow do most of the film through practical effects including most of the explosions and destruction.

",0.504,-0.9968,2020-02-26 00:00:00,6,"What has happened? Have people become so blinded by explosions and spikes that real characters and story are forgotten in our collective conscious? I was mostly just bored watching this mindless cliché. I give it 6/10 because it's mildly entertaining and fast moving, plus the sets, cinematography, action sequences, costumes and sound design are all great. But the characters and the story left no mark on me whatsoever. In fact they just made me a bit angry, especially when I realised how many people give acclaim to this empty ride.5 years later writing this review, I forgot there were ""the wives"" or the old ladies or what the characters were even doing, so I had to read other reviews to remember it. Do you just forget an actual good story?? No!
I didn't just forget Lord of the Rings, 12 Angry Men, Back to the Future, Toy Story, The Shining, even Frozen for god's sake! - actual memorable storiesWhat the hell happens in Mad Max: Fury Road?!
There's a cliché evil bad guy with absolutely zero depth. There's a 1 armed women who is the main character and there's a guy called Max who says nothing, we know pretty much nothing about and does nothing to care about. And the same goes for all other characters we're supposed to root for. Why do we even care where they're going? The characters themselves don't even know or care where they're going, as evidenced by the fact: they just go through a bunch of desert car chases in the desert then get to somewhere quiet in the desert, meet some old ladies who have no depth, then they drive back so they can do some car chases again. Oh yeah and the evil dictator has a big stash of drinking water. Okay let's kill him and release all the drinking water onto the floor. Yay, now we're the rulers! The end.What happened in our generation to gain critical appreciation for this mindless crap? Yes it's got explosions and great vehicles and spikes to look at, but where's the soul?I wonder if an older film with actual soul like... 12 Angry Men... would still hold up to this generation, maybe it's just lost like tears in the rain...."

Then I recently purchased it on 4k blu-ray and let me tell you it looks Panty wetting amazing from start to finish. from the detail on the steering wheel in Furisoa rig, to the explosions, to the grains of sand in the desert wasteland it just looks stunning, some parts have been given that much depth it's almost 3D and the HDR makes all the colours just pop

" Truly remarkable
",0.7579,0.9957,2020-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Initially when first seeing this I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean I thought it was cool but it felt very ""style over substance"". Years late I've watched it countless times and I definitely have a different opinion of it. Its without a doubt one of the wildest, creative, pulse pounding, unique films ever made. The star of the movie is of course Furiosa played by a fierce Charlize Theron whom justly won an oscar for it. Nicholas Hoult is the second most interesting character and his journey is truly emotional and engaging. And well the title character Mad Max is the third most interesting character. Tom Hardy does a solid job of playing him crazy but the role is underwritten and mostly depends on his impressive physicality. Set years after the third film and Max has failed to help the tribe of children. He's constantly haunted by them and finds himself suddenly thrust into a harrowing situation in which Furiosa betrays her boss and decides to help his wives to escape. The action scenes are thrilling and have a real raw energy to them. The score is wonderfully intense and epic and the cinematography and stunt work are something truly magical and need to be seen to be believed. In the end it's not completely able to shake some thin spots but overall it's one of the best films ever made."

Violent. You surely wont get bored. I did though, because the characters are only there to get blown up, chased, blown up again and chased again. There is only so much action upon action I can take before I get bored.BUT, looking at most of the popular and critics reviews, this is one hell of an action spectacle.

Almost the perfect manifestation of an action film, this recent ""Mad Max"" franchise installment goes to show that (somewhat) steady camera work and a well-built (read: minimal CGI) world full of unique characters can leave an audience in awe of its accomplishment. That's not to say that a lot of the stuff in this film is weird and crazy, but it just fits so well within the story that is being told.

The action left me bored, the dialogue left me bemused and the story went totally AWOL. Positives were probably Charlize and the visuals but nothing else.

" Fantastic action, but maybe a little too much
",0.3182,0.8818,2020-01-21 00:00:00,8,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a great action movie with a spectacular technical department. Indeed George Miller was fantastic because all the scenes are clear and thrilling, and some of them are very memorable. The score is also inspired: frenetic and tense and it surely enriches all the action. But the most impressive thing is that almost every choreography is realised through practical stunts and this is particularly important because the movie has a a grounded and ""realistic"" taste because of this practical stunts and in doing so it raises the level of the tension the viewer can feel. And finally I liked all the performances and the characterisation of the main characters. I found pretty solid the idea to give Max a little backstory so he can be perceived as mysterious and intriguing and I found him very cool.
The only problem for me is that there is toooo much action. Clearly I want to see action if I watch ""Mad Max"" but I would have preferred a little more time spent on characters's interactions instead of almost 110 minutes straight of car chasing. And this was a problem for me because I found myself bored when these scenes were longer than 25-30 minutes. And probably it is only a problem of mine because maybe I can take only a few action at a time but sometimes I was bored and I can't hide this aspect.
In general ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a more than suggested movie, very frenetic and with a fast pacing, great visuals and music, that can be boring in some parts but it's not a very big deal: if you are searching for adrenaline in a movie this is a great choice!"

He's the biggest actor of his generation & he's a hell of a presence on screen. I've only recently got into Tom Hardy films as he hasn't done much that i wanted to see or be interested in seeing except his excellent role of ""Bane"" in the 3rd part of Nolan's Batman Trilogy ""The Dark Knight Rises"" & that was it for ages until he did the Marvel film ""Venom"" which i absolutely loved & consider it easily one of the best ""Marvel"" films & one of the best comic-book films, then i saw his ""Mad Max"" & he was excellent in the role of our hero of the dangerous wasteland.""FURY ROAD"" is a full throttle action packed adventure through the ever dangerous Apocalyptic wastelands & the original Director George Miller is back with his new Masterpiece.
The excellent Charlize Theron is great here too but this is Hardy's Mad Max he's as good as Mel Gibson if not better in some ways!!!
The cinematography is gorgeous as expected & the scarily violent warrior & gang filled world of Mad Max is much more explored in this movie,
The music is banging Awesome throughout & the action is tough, brutal & Awesome!!! It's one hell of furious road trip accross dangerous territory & Mad finds some people to help & begins a violent quest of dazzling action set pieces.
There's too many crazy-funny & just plain Awesome bits in this instant CLASSIC.
Tom Hardy has stunned me again recently with his intense performance in Christopher Nolan's New WW2 survival MASTERPIECE ""Dunkirk"" he just keeps getting better as an actor.Anyway Mad Max:Fury Road is fantastic fast & furious fun & is truthfully the best Mad Max film so far!!! Hardy does a better job than Gibson"

" Crazy aesthetics
",-0.34,-0.7592,2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Awe-inspiring aesthetics and masterful photography. The film unleashes a devastating force and arrogance in all its directorial and scenographic choices starting from the punk and cyberpunk taste of the costumes, to arrive at the meticulous quality of the never banal chase scenes and furious fights aboard whimsical and eccentric cars. In the face of the fact that this ""action package"" occupies most of the vision after all, and therefore it would have been easy to fall into repetitiveness. These are undoubtedly positive elements, which fill in all respects the semblance of emptiness (desired and not at all dystopian) in the deepening of the plot of the characters, and in particular of the protagonist. These latter criticisms of the film are understandable, but nevertheless they do not in any way undermine the audiovisual experience, which is decidedly of another level compared to modern action cinema."

This film doesn't even have a script and it was the right way to do this. The action is mostly without CGI and considering the fact that current blockbusters can't reach the greatness of this film's action by using full of CGI, one of the most if not the most endeavored action film ever. Even after the film I though that it was an ok 6 with lots of CGI but after I did my search, I found out that they really did it, they really crushed those cars, they really did. This is a huge milestone for action films just like the dark knight is a milestone for superhero movies."
" The best action film of the decade.
",0.6369,0.8634,2019-12-19 00:00:00,10,"It was clear to me that George Miller's intention with this soft reboot of Mad Max, was to make a 2-hour long action sequence that tells a story. And this movie accomplishes that ambitious task flawlessly. In this post-apocalyptic wasteland, our anti-hero Max Rockatansky, is captured by the ruthless war boys, who are under the command of the wasteland's dictator, Immortan Joe, who has power over the remaining lives on this deserted planet by controlling the only source of running water guarded by his lovely sons and his war boy army who are on the never ending quest for gasoline, weapons, and utter chaos with the hopes of arriving at the silver and chrome gates of Valhalla. In order to save what remains of the planet from total destruction and slavery, Imperial Furiosa, the badass one armed truck driver and expert sniper will need to team up with Max and the renegade war boy Nux in order to rescue the enslaved wives of Immortan Joe, and find the ""Green Place"" in order to save them selves and find hope in the never ending suffering of the wasteland. What separates an action film like Fury Road from movies directed by Michael Bay or any other boring mindless action film, is that the action in Fury Road means something. The constant fighting and amazingly choreographed chases our characters go through, they go through it because they'll find redemption not only in themselves but also in the post-apocalyptic nightmare in which they come from. The action has significant meaning to the overall theme of this movie which is hope. And on a technical level, this movie is breathtaking. The chases are real, the explosions are real, the vehicles ARE REAL, and because of that, George Miller has a made a film that will forever be timeless. This movie is amazing, I was literally sweating after seeing it in the theaters. It's about as visceral and compelling as an action film gets. 10/10."

" An epic visual marvel of an action movie, with enough ideas to keep you satisfied and engaged
",0.8074,0.9976,2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"The opening to Mad Max may well be the most attention-grabbing I've seen, gluing me to the edge of my seat eager to see how the movie unfolds. The energy and visuals continue to amaze throughout, though the early world-building was the best storytelling in the film. The vision of the desolate post-apocalyptic world was so well realized, I was a bit disappointed when I realized the movie was pretty much exclusively going to be a big long car chase. The opening 20 minutes or so, when we see Max chased and caught, meet the ruler and get a sense of how the world works, and meet Furiosa and get a sense of her plan, are near perfect filmmaking and great set up for the characters and world. We do learn more about the girls and crucially more about the people working for the ruler through Nux, a stowaway turned traitor, but the movie is light on character development, dialogue, and plot. That's not all bad - Miller is committed to making a thrilling visual action movie, and he undeniably nails that. The action is so well shot it makes similar action sequences feel fresh and exciting. There is some relevance to contemplate as we see Furiosa certain that there is a green place where she grew up, only to realize it was an illusion in her mind and that her only real hope is realizing the potential of where she has been living and taking control there. I admire Miller's commitment to making a great action movie and not forcing a bunch of dialogue or romance in, but while I marvel at the craft and visuals of the action, especially early, the other elements are good but not great, and even the greatest action scenes repeated for 2 hours can't maintain that same level of awe."

" Fury Road - We're on a Road to Nowhere.
",-0.5719,-0.9998,2019-12-06 00:00:00,2,"Whilst there were a couple of good things about this film, I ultimately found Fury Road very disappointing, and my Suspension of Disbelief was trashed by all the unbelievable garbage this film contains. Tom Hardy wasn't bad as the new Max and Charlize Theron's Furiosa was a strong female character in the tradition of the franchise. I am a fan of both of these actors, but the screenplay was just awful; cheesy, lame dialogue, so bad it was vomit inducing: ""Why are you hurting those people?"" - ""It's the oil stupid."" - ""Mankind has gone rogue, terrorising itself."" The Fury Road prologue was badly written trash compared to the poetic prologue of The Road Warrior. ""Do not my friends, become addicted to water, it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence."" WTF? Who wrote this moronic tripe? Fury Road broke the cardinal rule of film-making - Show, Don't Tell. Fury Road showed us nothing (except car chases and stunts) and Told us Everything (very badly). Fury Road introduced some interesting concepts and then failed to explore any of them adequately, and subsequently the expositional info dumps were totally unbelievable. A good sequel should expand on the original, and show us something new along with the familiar elements. Apart from the pathetic Granny Biker Gang, Fury Road showed us exactly what we had seen before except it was ten times more over the top. Even the awful Beyond Thunderdome showed us something new.It was way too over the top and didn't fit the gritty, more realistic tone of the earlier films. It was a comic-book version with embarrassingly bad dialogue and bad acting, (that Bullet-Farmer guy has to be the worst actor I've ever seen). In The Road Warrior it was established that projectile weapons were rare and ammunition even rarer and carefully hoarded, but in Fury Road they fire off thousands of rounds. Fuel was even rarer yet in Fury Road there are enormous amounts of fuel wasted: that idiot with the Guitar/Flamethrower was ridiculous, in the post-apocalypse wasteland fuel would be a resource strictly rationed not shot out of guitars (even though we're TOLD there's a place called ""Gas Town"" it still doesn't make sense to waste it like that, oil deposits do dry up). As the dude sitting in front of us rightly stated ""What a load of bullcrap"". EXACTLY.The biggest WTF? moment in Fury Road was the ludicrous idea that you could carry enough extra fuel on motorbikes to travel for one hundred and sixty days, not to mention the fact that even from the east coast to the west coast of Australia, the trip would only take four or five days tops. After sixteen days riding in a straight line you'd be somewhere in the middle of the ocean. Utter trash.With The Road Warrior George Miller struck gold and he has been repeating himself ever since, trying and failing to recapture what made the Road Warrior a worldwide hit by plagiarising himself. Fury Road rips off scenes from the first three films:The Film Going out Of Focus as Max crawls away from the wreckage of the Interceptor: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.A Thieving Pilot is Redeemed at The End: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.Max Wears a Mis-Matched Pair of Boots - Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.The Wind-up Music Box - The Road Warrior. Fury Road.Max Pulls Out A Hundred Concealed Guns: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.Someone Plays a Saxophone Solo: Mad Max. Beyond Thunderdome.The White Painted Guy: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.The Feral Kid: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.Granny with a Shotgun: Mad Max. Fury Road.Max's Shotgun Misfires: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.People Tied To The Front Of Vehicles: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.Max Buried In The Sand: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.The Antagonist Dies in a Head-On Collision with a Truck: Mad Max. The Road Warrior.The Interceptor is Trashed: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.Max Gets a Haircut and Kids Collect the Discarded Hair: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.A Massive Dust Storm: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.The Good Guys Escape Leaving Max Behind: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.A Character Finds Redemption Inspired By Love: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.The Road Battle: Fury Road is just a feature length remake of The Road Warrior's climactic road battle.After reading interviews with George Miller I have realised that he really doesn't have a clue:""The previous three films exist in no clear chronology, because they were all conceived as different films."" WTF? The first three films are in strict chronological order.1. Mad Max: Civilisation exists, there is Government, Law and Order and infrastructure. The Interceptor is brand new. This film is Dystopian.2. The Road Warrior: The Interceptor is dirty, dented and it's modified. There's been a nuclear holocaust. Civilisation is gone. The Interceptor is trashed and blown up.3. Beyond Thunderdome: Max no longer has the Interceptor. He's grown a wicked mullet, has new transport and a small arsenal of weaponry. Primitive forms of trade and civilisation are emerging. We see the nuked ruins of Sydney. Water sellers are selling water contaminated with radiation.That's clear indication of these films all being in strict chronological order, there's no other way they could fit together. Beyond Thunderdome can't be set before Road Warrior or Mad Max, Mad Max can't take place after Road Warrior or Beyond Thunderdome, Road Warrior can't be set before Mad Max. That's a fact, the logic is indisputable.George Miller may be able to write and direct cool action sequences (though unlike the first two films, these are heavily powered by Hollywood Action Movie PhysicsTM) but he sucks at writing character and dialogue as Fury Road proved without a doubt. If you are a Mad Max fan and have not yet seen Fury Road, watch The Road Warrior instead, it's fifty times better than this mega-budget, over the top, badly written crud."
" Move aside hollywood, this is how the AUSSIES make their action films!
",0.0,0.9988,2019-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller and is the forth and hopefully not last in the legendary Mad Max franchise. The action in this movie was ABSOLUTLEY INCREDIBLLLLLEEEEEEE! and everything I was so desperate to see again in the Action film genre. The movie is shot PERFECTLY. Seriously, every single shot of this film has it's own place and purpose of pushing the action forward and the cinematography blended with the stunts and practical effects, explosions and destruction is electrifying to watch and is pure cinematic magic to behold in all it's pure kinetic and masculine glory. The sandstorm sequence was so incredibly well crafted and shot my jaw dropped the first time I saw it in theatres. It's still one of the most awe inspiring action sequences ever shot on cameras and put together in the editing room.The film reeks with Australian wit and attitude and bleeds with human emotion as we relate to the struggle of Furiosa and her ruthless drive to save her people from the evil Immortan Joe's control. Many crazy and memorable character follow like the over confident, fanatical but easily influenced Nux, The Five Wives, Rictus, The Organic Farmer and of course, Max. Who is so mad that he barley even speaks, but he gets better throughout the film as his ability becomes better and better. Tom Hardy has incredible prescence in the movie with the mouth brace now becoming an iconic image in cinema history.Fury Road truly raises the bar in what it means to make your movie as awesome as humanly possible. The action sequences are large in scale with so many different types of post-apocalyptic vehicles to play with, the rythym of the action is also pitch perfect and operatic in it's excecution. The explosions in this movie are joyous to watch and bring out that childlike instinct in you who just loves the beauty of watching things blow up that made you a fan of action in the first place. The whole choreography of the destruction in the movie is all directed with such complicated precision and structure, like the structure of a song or a sequence in a fireworks show. It's all pre planned with such brilliant motion and timing, again your jaw drops with just the style of how it all unfolds before your eyes.Fury Road is perfect in it's style and execution and gives the action fanatic exactly what the want to see. A non stop action thrill ride aswell as an emotional story to boot with a vivid and detailed world and backdrop. The music is great too and again adds so much adrenaline to the whole experience. A vivid and practical action masterpiece that will go down in film and pop-culture history as an Australian classic showing George Miller's practical handcrafted techniques over CGI and conventional modern Hollwood action filmmaking style that slowly become the norm. We honestly need more movies like this again and I hope future blockbuster hear Miller's plea to reinvent the trendOverall, pure razor edged Action masterpiece with Australian magic sprinkled into it's DNA with a compelling post-apocalyptic story and action squences which are ruthless in their delivery and will captivate and electrify the audience in it's style and scale with an outstanding female co protagonist Charlize Theron makes the movie. She was a pure badass aswell as being very emotionally depthed. I hope there is a next installment in the works, It will probably be more story orientated over Max's character and his relationship with the Australian wasteland around him and the characters that live in it over the action sequences, because I have no idea how the action showcased in this movie could be topped"

" Grandpa makes a great action movie
",0.6249,0.9969,2019-11-21 00:00:00,10,"The success of an action movie really depends on the execution of the action itself. This is generally why it's a bad idea to make a no-budget action movie unless you know how to produce good action without any money. A lot of money makes a lot of moviemaking easier, but, in particular, it helps with action scenes.Mad Max Fury Road was an expensive movie, and it shows gloriously. The story is super simple, and reminds me of Dredd. There's no complex plot to tangle with, just the personalities and the journey, a there and back again structure that lends itself really well to the type of action on display. Women try to escape a prison, drive across the desert, find their destination, and then head back. There's plenty of room for absolutely bonkers action sequences and a surprising amount of character work.Our central and titular character Max grunts his way through the movie. He's far less verbose than he had been in previous movies (lending some textual credence that he's actually the feral kid from The Road Warrior rather than Max himself), but even though he doesn't talk he still has a well-defined arc. It's pretty much the same arc he has in both The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome where he's just out to help himself but finds himself helping a group of the weaker against a strong enemy. In The Road Warrior, it was the people mining the oil pump. In Beyond Thunderdome, it was the kids. In Fury Road, it's the breeders and their leader Furiosa.Furiosa is great. She's headstrong but more impulsive than she thinks she is. She's prepared her escape well, but she didn't realize the scope of the troubles that would fall on her for her action. Without the happy coincidence of Max, she'd have either lost everything on the way out, or reached her destination and just driven out into the desert with 160 days worth of gasoline, hoping to find something.Immortan Joe, the antagonist of the film, is such a fantastic looking character. With shades of Darth Vader in his breathing apparatus, a massive frame, and a terrifying voice, Joe has an incredible presence. It's easy to see how he would incite both great fear in his enemies and awe in his supporters. How he could use both his presence and position over a necessary resource (water) to create a slave state.On top of all of this is some of the most incredibly impressive action I've ever seen. The key to elongated action sequences is finding ways to change the action around while keeping the pace going. You'd think that with a car chase, there'd only be so many combinations one could come up with, but this is where the weirdness of the Max universe really turns into an asset. It's not two cars in pursuit. It's a war rig followed by a variety of different vehicles with different weapons, speeds, and abilities. My favorite of them all is the pole cats, which the movie saves for the ending and uses to great effect. Those metronomic motions create great opportunities for visuals, including what might be my favorite single shot from a modern action movie.It's amazing how George Miller, the grandpa of a director, maintains the pace and energy through all two hours. It's a magnificent thrill ride."

",-0.4939,0.1287,2019-11-14 00:00:00,5,"Fury Road has a great feature, and that is Charlize Theron, who gives a commanding performance in what is a selfless savior hero role: driven to act by desperate revulsion at her life and forlorn hope of redemption. She plays this really well, and certainly the film is centred on her almost character experience.Besides this the film displays itself like a symphony of carnival tricks, complete with clown and freak performers in a mad madly of heightened improbability; building to extensive intensely choreographed almost physical comedy routines.Max in all of it seems less a road warrior and more of a trapeze artist teetering above a big tent cacophony.If you like it you probably love it, but personally I only appreciated Charlize Theron's impeccable contribution.In terms of story telling, beneath the clownish stylistic surface features, there isn't anything else of note to see here in my opinion. Nothing remarkable or particularly new for this genre or this filmmaker.I personally prefer Mad Max 2 by a margin and overall I like the etchings of daily decay evidenced by the original Mad Max at the initiation of this property.I do see much style and practical artifice and one standout turn in Fury Road so I give this film a STRONG 5/10 score in my personal ratings"

" A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
",0.7386,0.9852,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Three decades (1971-85) after presenting the Mad Max trilogy which enjoys a cult status among action movie aficionados, Australian writer-director George Miller has returned with a fourth film seeking to reboot the series with Mad Max - Fury Road.
Set in a post-apocalyptic desolate desert-lands of a dystopian future, this movie find the protagonist Max (Tom Hardy), an ex-cop and road warrior, trying to survive the feral forces controlled by the tyrannical warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who controls the precious resources of water, fuel and blood. He joins forces with renegade warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is trying to escape the clutches of Joe with five of his slave wives. What follows is a long chase where Joe with his army of warriors in monster trucks and myriad malevolent contraptions try to hunt down Max and Furiosa.While it is true that story line is wafer thin and the characters lack any semblance of depth, Miller is successful in using them to create a powder keg of an action package which brims with raw energy and is sure to blow the mind of the viewers. Miller mounts humongous adrenaline rushing action set-pieces which are highly original and chaotic in wreaking their hyper-kinetic havoc by seamlessly melding the old world action elements with contemporary CGI wizardry.While a noisy thumping heavy metal score that elevates the impact of the action set pieces to a level unprecedented in recent times, brilliant cinematography captures the desolate desert-scapes in beguiling beauty and the well mounted action spectacles with rare clarity which is amiss in junkyard jamborees like Transformers series as well as several superhero movies. Charlize Theron, the real hero of the movie, is in kickass form as Furiosa and Tom Hardy does justice in reprising the gritty titular role of Max with a quiet intensity.While I've never been a fan of loud music or mindless mayhem, Miller brings them together in an hypnotic concoction that would engross the viewers as never before. There is craft in the chaos of these jaw-dropping stunt sequences which set the bar for action movies high and could teach a lesson or two to the Michael Bays who pride themselves as makers of mighty blockbusters.A veritable treat for action and auto junkies that could be best enjoyed on the BIG screen with 3D (IMAX 3D, if possible) !!"

While touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity, the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much. The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film."
" WOW! Terrible absolutely terrible!
",-0.3703,0.7822,2019-10-18 00:00:00,1,"What made the original Mad Max great was that despite the violence and shocking moments, there was heart! You could see the motivation and the specific moments were evident that were going to change the man forever. We could understand why he chose to channel his rage and we also saw glimpses of the man that used to be.
Despite the shocking violence we still routed for him and we understood his personal pain, the evolution to MADMAX unfolded and we could relate to how a good man could go down this path.
So what happened here!! We have a character that is mute and apart from being Tom Hardy has little else going for him. There is a story, but it lacks any depth and isn't really related to our main character. It might aswell be called Ladies being chased! My advice stick to the original and Hollywood don't do a sequel!!"

It's stunning to look at and has some of the best choreographed action sequences ever filmed. But Fury Road is not only a feast for your eyes and ears, it also has some narrative heft and two terrific performances by Tom Hardy and especially Charlize Theron. Theron's Furiosa, joins Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor as one of the great female action heroines of all-time. George Miller has taken a B-movie premise and turned it into something approaching a singular work of art.

" Who said women were bad drivers?
",-0.5423,0.9618,2019-09-13 00:00:00,6,"This is not sexism but only a joke in response to the radical feminism that seemed to be fueling every major franchise reboot today... with the exception of ""Rocky"".Let's start positively: ""Fury Road"" provides the most spectacular chases of all the tetralogy but the film is only ""The General"" with bigger stunts though what made Buster Keaton's film appreciable is that he risked his neck. And I still have a fondness for ""Road Warrior"" over-the-top climax and the ""Plane, Train and Automobiles"" sequence concluding ""Thunderdome""... speaking of which, we're talking of a 30-year time span between the last movies and that he could pull effect both practical and effective to an audience raised by the digital revolution is perhaps the best stunt of all. Now, forgive my sophism but it takes more than action to make action movies work and ""Fury Road"" was so stuck to the steering wheel it took its driver for granted.The first might be the slowest or the least thrilling of the four but that's how we were introduced to Max Rockatansky, his skills, his humility, his tormenting hesitation between settling down and sticking with the family or hitting the road to fight the filth of the Earth. The whole exposition culminated with the tragic loss of his wife and baby child. In the next films, Max had won its status as a pop-culture hero, he resented that word but that was part of his persona. ""Fury Road"" doesn't embarrass itself with such technicalities, if makes Furiosa an immediate heroine, a Joan of Arc without any character's arc.The character had potential but she was as semi-developed character as as if we had met Sarah Connor in ""Terminator 2"" or Ellen Ripley in ""Aliens"". These heroines were fascinating not only for their backstory as non-warrior characters but for the fact that they weren't handled like flashbacks but as true plot drivers. Furiosa is strong and bad-ass already and God forbids Mel Gibson would be an aging Mad Max playing her mentor (too controversial), or for her to show any semblance of vulnerability (too taboo).And as the emotionless, shaved-headed heroine (à la Joan of Arc indeed) she displays traits that play like ersatz of masculinity, cliché even by guy-movies standard. Tough, hardly talking, always right, Furiosa doesn't even shed a tear when one of the ""breeders"" die or when she discovers the sad truth about the Green Place. I simply don't get what is so appealing in overly confident characters. Think of many icons, Michael Corleone didn't want to be a mobster, Travis Bickle started as Mr. Nice Guy, Rocky was a bum, characters who are perfect from the start might kick ass but they're ultimately boring, and a 120-format with 10% minutes for dialogues made of 90% of grunting doesn't help.Still, one can appreciate the post-apocalyptic elements, violence, regression, the rarefaction of oil and water, but the first films covered all these speculative aspects. ""Fury Road"" just takes one step forward, after settlers vs. gangs, then marauders vs. migrants, then new glimpses of civilization, it's fair to imagine a neo-fascist world ruled by men and relegating women to their primitive functions: breeding and nurturing. There's something visionary in the way the film switches from the usual horizontal struggle (nomads vs. settlers) to vertical domination, but it also implies that in order to survive, women must display the same skills as men, elevating driving and fighting as Darwinian assets.The film suggest matriarchy and self-determination as salutary options, after all the plot is about 'selected' women being freed by one of them. So basically, the alternative from being locked away by men is to be their own master. The problem is that unlike the previous films where children were present among settlers, ""Fury Road"" is rather pessimistic, implying that couples won't exist. And since the feminist take doesn't disregard the necessity to have children (for the survival of mankind), one must consider how they will have them if not by exploiting or using men as well. This feminism ironically depends on power perceptions inherited from men. Is it such a coincidence that all the fugitives are beautiful and the obese milk providers are left to their condition?The film contains some epic-looking images and thrilling sequences but with a rather thin and manipulative plot served by very one-dimensional characters, and that goes for Furiosa too. She shares so many skills and personality traits with Max that I kept wondering what was Max' role exactly, except to be a foil for Furiosa, exactly what happened between Han Solo and Rey when she told him she could handle herself. And the film ends with the same acknowledgement from the original hero, foreshadowed by the name of Charlize Theron put above Tom Hardy in the opening shot.This is not a hierarchy to trivialize, once again, we have a film where every man is flawed, weak and ironically, this is something I won't complain about because the War boys were touching in their twisted away and I liked Immortan Joe for even that scary dude had a weak spot. But ""Fury Road"" works exactly like ""The Force Awakens"", the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie, ""Toy Story 4"" or even ""Blade Runner 2049"", it recycles plots with that radical anti-male perspective, it's like the sole purpose of these reboots is to cure classics from misogyny they didn't have.Because even the first ""Mad Max"" films had strong female characters, the old lady in the first, Max' wife that he failed to save, and Tina Turner who spares his life at the end of ""Thunderdome"", another thing they had in common: they were fun to watch, I wish one character could make us smile or chuckle at least once.A product of its preachy and pedant era, the film takes itself too seriously and this is why it's my least favorite."

It does all kinds of neat stuff. Ya have to look at Max as a story. A story people tell, so timeline doesn't matter. Imortan Joe is signed on for 3 more films, but he died in this one. So someone else will tell a different story. His car may be put together or it may not be. He's just a guy trying to survive and help people when he has too, to survive. And the fact that 90% of it is real. The guitarist actually burned himself on accident because they really built that guitar like that. It's insane the more you watch and the more you see."

And without Gibson, that's not it. Tom Hardy is good, but he just can't replace him.

" Extremely Over the Top - That's why it's a masterpiece
",0.7322,0.9931,2019-08-26 00:00:00,10,"To put this quite simply, everything about this film is insane. This is quite possibly the best action film of the 2000s and probably THE best action film of the 2010s.With quite limited dialogue throughout, Miller manages to engage you with incredible action with excellent cinematography to display it. If you want to see non-shaky camera showing wide shots of explosions and literally what you think of when someone says ""action,"" then this should please you thoroughly. The way the action has been created for this film is jaw-dropping, especially in the final act and most of this film uses practical effects and extremely minimal CGI, and it looks so much better than other action films or action within films that use CGI!This film is also the perfect example of showing heroic/strong female characters really well. Imperator Furiosa is definitely my favourite female character from any action film and maybe my favourite female character from ANY film or very close to my favourite. There are other female characters that vary from a rather young age to a rather old age actually and they are all portrayed to be capable and awesome. Max himself obviously is a main character but to be honest, the title of this film doesn't really fit. Whilst Max is in it, it's really Furiosa's film and story but nevertheless, Max still does have a lot to do with the plot and is still a major character. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron nail their roles and put some really good performances to the screen. It is also worth mentioning that the score is absolutely fantastic and really fitting for the theme of this film.To reference Chris Stuckmann in his review of this film: ""This is the best 80s action film that was not released in the 80s"" I highly recommend this film to not just action fans, but film fans in general. It is currently my favourite film of the decade and my favourite action film of all time.My Ratings:

" Best post-apocalyptic movie in ages.
",0.6369,0.9376,2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,"Amazing use of bright desert colors and not so blue night. Feels quite different than the usual dull theme for such movies. I love the use of live vehicles and scenes over excessive CGI. (Depends on movie type tho.) Building those vehicles, setting up real explosions, using real polecats and rock riders, all make the movie a better experience. 3-Act Structure plot well defined, as well as ""show, don't tell"" well executed. The tension escalated steadily, reaching the movie climax and giving a satisfying end. The return chase was action-packed.Another kudo to Miller for cutting frames during any actions. Well thought of. Gives off interesting vibes. There's unfortunate logic in that humans would likely use other humans as meat and milk. Resources like food, water, and oil would be guarded and tyrants would rise.You can see how poorly Joe views his people, war boys, produce, and breeders. Joe wasting so much fuel in his race is an amazing display of power. He's so ""rich"" he has enough to throw away. At least, that's the image he gives to his followers since he gets called out by the People Eater. Best line from Joe is the ""don't get addicted to water."" You'd expect someone to say the same, but for coffee. Also, the war boys, indoctrinated from childhood and proudly dying for a leader that doesn't care for them. Ouch.Furiosa, badass strong female character represented in much more than just ""kick ass."" She earned her high rank position, although I'm sure it cost her arm. She wants redemption, surely for the horrible things she had to do. The war boys don't even question what she meant by detour. Taking Joe's 'wives' was such a bold move. Upon discovering the Green Place is gone, you can feel the pain with her.Obvious that several women have been sexually abused, yet no need to show the actual act. Kudos for showing their trauma, feelings, and various reactions. The 5 'wives' were so diverse in personalities. Another plus for Joe treating 'his wives' well. They're healthy, educated, and have their own space, living the ""high life"" despite being rape victims. This way they will give birth to a healthy heir. It'd be no good if he treated them like trash and underfed them.Max, literally haunted by his past, enough to hear voices and see things. Funny how Max is just there, along for the ride. Furiosa drives the plot and he follows. Thanks to Nux for bringing his 'blood bag' along. Plus, once Nux is separated from Joe long enough, he becomes saner. Even Max becomes more trusting. While Fury Road can stand on its own, it's useful to watch the previous three Mad Max movies to get a feel of who Max is and the world.Use of the War Rig is top notch. That's one way to drive shiny and chrome. Best vehicle. It could even be its own character at this point. The storm was such a great render with an amazing quality and terror. Using lost knowledge and repurposing everyday objects are so realistic. Miller in his commentary is right that people would cherish the things they have left. Every scraps would be reused. The unforgiving hot desert wasteland, dunes, and dread are both astounding to look at and terrifying.Another good note is the use of disabled people. Not just Furiosa's one arm or Max's insanity. The doof warrior is blind and I presume the drummers behind are too. Miller has done a great job in showing that physical and mental impairment don't prevent people from surviving the apocalypse. The use of medical conditions like fever, cancer, tumors, and stitched wounds make the environment feel harsh. Only a few, like the wives are in top shape because reasons cited earlier.The acting. Entirely believable. The war boys are complete lunatics, suicide bombing, wanting a glorious death. Furiosa has one arm while the actress has both and despite this, you can believe an arm is missing in movement and use of the mechanical arm. As mentioned, the 5 eives with different personalities and Nux changing over the movie.Lastly, glad Joe is dead and Furiosa took his place, in a positive light."

It exceeded my expectations in so many ways. The use of practical effects were amazing. It was like car pirates on the open desert. That paired with awesome characters including the bad ass old ladies. Just so cool and weird and awesome. Loved it.
" ""You're bleeding!"" ""That's not his blood.""
",0.0,0.9926,2019-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Back when this film came out there seemed to be a big love affair with it. The critics loved it and those who I talked to who saw it in the theatres loved it and said it was the best MAD MAX film yet. I sort of couldn't believe it. You mean it's even better than THE ROAD WARRIOR/MAD MAX 2? After my dad and I rented it and watched it we were both blown away and yes I must say that this film is the best in the series. Everything that was great about THE ROAD WARRIOR is amped up even more in this entry and done even better.This time Tom Hardy plays the title role in Max. He does very well in the role and I have no complaints about him in the role. Just personally and this does not take anything anyway from this film, he does not outdo Mel Gibson in the role. I think I liked Gibson more in the role. But, there is so much action and other characters that you should enjoy that mixed with the fact that he more than fills the role I never really compared the two during my two viewings of this film.Within the MAD MAX timeline I think this is supposed to happen before THE ROAD WARRIOR. Anyways, there is action right from the start and it does not let up. The beautiful and ever so talented Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa and she has been given the task of driving gasoline for the bad guys. But, she has thwarted their plans and is on the run from them...along with the wives of the main baddie Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who returns, but don't really now it is him under the mask he wears). More than enough story to mesh with the truly spectacular action.This film also has some great modern music from Tom Holkenborg or Junkie XL that really goes well with what George Miller is putting on the screen. Really it is just a giant chase that in the end shows that Miller has out done himself incredibly and if you enjoyed most importantly THE ROAD WARRIOR/MAD MAX 2 you MUST watch this film. Written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris."
" an overload of extravagant action set pieces, metal soundtrack, and post-apocalyptic setting
",-0.3612,-0.9072,2019-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Mad Max: Fury Road is an overload of an overload of extravagant action set pieces, metal soundtrack, and post-apocalyptic setting. It relishes in all its glorious action, but isn't enough to carry the film on an emotional level.Driven by characters who battles for survival in a barren and water-less world, Fury Road touches upon themes of loss, higher purpose, tyranny and, surprisingly, feminist message. Tom Hardy, playing the titular character, is haunted by the loss of someone who constantly appears in his imagination. Driven by guilt and or sadness, he seeks survival as the tyrannical, cult regime of Immortan Joe forces the people around him to beg for water. Charlize Theron stars as Furiosa, the leader of an escaped group of females who seek the Green Place. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux, a fanatic member of Immortan Joe who would die willingly for his cause. The characters are driven by their respective motives, each being revealed as the film progresses. However, there is too much action for the drama and character interactions to settle and majority of the best emotional moments are placed near the end leaving the rest of the film lacking much in substance.7.5/10"

" Miller's Magnum Opus
",0.0,-0.9529,2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"My world is fire and blood. George Miller went full maestro mode. This is one of of those films that Miller was probably dreaming about for 40 years. This is a film in which his visionary concept is fully realized. He interweaves high octane action scenes throughout an unforgiving aussie post-apocalyptic world and it never comes off as unneeded or over done which is something the fast and furious franchise suffers from.
Some of the vehicles are battle armored v-8's that resemble metal beasts of hell. Some of the older films I am sure suffered from budget constraints and you won't see many vehicles lacking here.
Even though the movie is a big chase scene filled with Miller's stylized action the movie never loses it's humanity or soul. ""Out here, everything hurts."" These aren't shallow protagonists. Max suffers from ptsd. Furiosa isn't just an escapee. Everyone has suffered except the psychopaths. The reasons and motives make sense in that mad world.
I still respect Mel as Mad Max and I also see Hardy as Mad Max. Can you imagine someone else playing Rocky or Conan the barbarian maybe? Rocky no, Conan yes for me. Replacing actors is not an easy feat to pull off and coming from a super mad max fan, they pull it off right away.
The dialogue is minimal but catchy and appropriate to the scene. ""Say bye bye to the neck!"" Instead of ""you're dead meat"", is fun and memorable. You will never hear the word mediocre the same again. The manner in which the main villain labeling something mediocre to boys is hilarious. What a bully.
There is directorial genius to George Miller's mad world that can't be seen in any other action films and it isn't for everyone. It is an action masterpiece."

The characters' clothing, equipment, vehicles, background and mannerisms tell as much as any dialogue could. Look for the story and you'll find this piece is an exercise in world-building like no other.Combine that with incredibly creative and unendingly intense action and you have yourself one hell of a movie.And to those saying Hardy's acting is poor: again, look at his face.

They are decent and fun movie and they have some originality.But this new version, well no. It's not original it's just boring and stupid from the start to the end. I saw this in an Imax theater with a big confortable seat and still it was painful to watch. Most of the time, when I don't like a movie and I see that people rate it high I try to see the movie again, but with this awful garbage and absolutly will not do it.Compare to this movie, the original Mad Max is a pure masterpeice..."

I was on the edge of my seat throughout. I said ""that's the coolest thing I've ever seen"" about 47 times during the movie. so much about this movie is elite: the directing, the action, the score, the cinematography, the acting by the three leads (Hardy, Theron, Hoult), the imaginative world that was created, the creativity of the characters, the creativity of the vehicles. on my 8th viewing i was so blown away that i decided to give it my imaginary 11 star rating. only other movie i've given that to is Interstellar. as of now, mad max fury road is my second favorite movie of all time. it makes me happy :) (11 viewings, 7/11/2020)"

The script was amazing and the cast was amazing, just everything was amazing and sooo superb. This felt like a proper solid mad max movie. The soundtrack is incredible and so is the story. Now it dosent really feel like the title should have been named after mad max as i felt like he wasn't the main character, rather i feel like all pf the characters were the main characters as they all played their part in the story and also max didn't really say much so that was kind of weird, it should have just been called fury road but i mean hey, the movies good so thats all that counts. I also felt like some parts of the story was wacky like the whole baby milk thing but its mad max so there has to be some weird villain with weird things that he runs.

" Bizarrely Stunning
",0.3818,0.9493,2019-06-19 00:00:00,9,This is my first experience of the Mad Max franchise and had much to learn about its story. This movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery. Its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action. Really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush. Im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value.
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.997,2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"I watched this for the second time yesterday, and it was as satisfying as the first time. Fury Road is a little masterpiece (for those asking why my rate is just 8, I think that higher ratings should be reserved to era-defining movies and such).I'm not a fan of action flicks, nor I am of the Mad Max series; but this is a jewel in film making. Here are some notes:1) Action, action, action. Fury Road is an adrenaline bomb from start to finish. While, as I stated, I'm not fond of action itself, when a movie keeps you on the edge for two hours I like it. The problem with most action movies is that you have seen it all before, more or less; in Fury Road, 90% of the action is something new: funny, over the top, superfast, acrobatic, and surprising. It's obvious that the sequences are written with sincere passion, rather than with that ""let's stun the audience with special effects and milk their money!"" mood, that's ever increasing nowadays.2) While the photography deserves a mention itself for the over-saturated colors and the beautiful landscapes, the most important aspect about it is the action again. Photography is in service of action, and it does a wonderful job. Lots of scenes have a weird, fast framerate, that gives the movie a distinctive, funny, and obviously ""speedy"" look. Dozen of takes filming the explosions are made through old-fashioned fixed cameras mounted on the vehicles, so that you're thrown into the action for real - not like in today's movies, where odd and complicated digital camera movements take away all the emotions.3) The story. It's original and surprising, something of a ""move on from the same old tropes"". It starts and ends in an old-fashioned way, because it has to stay in its roots, but all what's in between is absolutely fresh. Characters are funny, deep, and all enjoy their personal arc.4) Max himself. Tom Hardy is a great replacement, and I'll say he's even better than Mel Gibson (or, something more on pace with the times). His grunts, short lines, and facial expressions (often subtly ironic) are just perfect. I'll also add that the rough, sharp way he moves and walk is a subtle and perfect rendering of that character, a man whose only goal is to survive.5) The design of sets, costumes and cars. Beautiful.6) The old-fashioned way: practical effects, little CGI, and the old way of shooting, as I mentioned. It's definitely better.7) The last and most compelling aspect of this movie in my opinion is that it's totally over the top. Exaggerated characters, sequences, and language (""blood bag"", ""witness me"", ""shiny and chrome""). The guitar player, the models, the fight with the car door, the gun wielding blind man... everything in this movie is just mad. I like this a lot, it's some kind of post-modern, pulpish cinema.Edit: I watched it for the third time, and I'd like to add,8) It's built like a comic book, really, and I like this very much. The three villains are straight from a comic book in their characterization. Lots of sequences are edited like comics, with interconnected shots and wide angles opening and closing them. Some obscure details like the missing shoe, the jacket, the bullet-teeth and so on get their brief screen time and help build the sequences, that's another thing you find in comics."

",-0.5423,0.2432,2019-06-18 00:00:00,2,This movie did absolutely nothing for me. I couldn't keep track of the storyline and the action was not what I'm interested in. I can see why others would love this flick but it's just not for me.
" Visually stunning. Loved the casting.

Mad Max: Fury Road engages it's audience with every adrenaline infused sequence, while never suffering from action fatigue by means of monotony. The raspy, cutting sounds and visuals of Fury Road's post apocalyptic landscape add to its vibrancy, grit and tenacity. George Miller's 2015 masterpiece shall go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time."
" Perfectly flawed.
",0.6369,-0.9781,2019-06-05 00:00:00,8,"It's very hard to review a picture that has already been regarded as a classic (and ""Best action movie of all time!"") but here goes. 'Mad Max 2' was a damn hard film to recreate and the look and feel of 'Fury Road' comes very close; with jaw-dropping stunt work and some stunning battle sequences. Just like 'The Road Warrior' (the perfect movie), it's mad folk being run-over at 120 mph, which is a standard, brilliant feature of any George Miller movie. Where it fails is that the whole film is one long chase sequence and you wonder why they are bothering to risk life and limb in doing so. For halfway through the movie the character Max has little involvement and even spends most of the second half strapped to the front of a car. The narration is told throughout the endless chase but it's unsatisfactory. As the time expects, the main character is a female, so it's more of a case of 'Mad Maxine'. You think it would have been simple to have just cut half the chasing away, developed the new Tom Hardy version of Max, to a younger audience, so they know what he's about (his history) and just crank up the violence! You really miss the colourful characters developed in 'Mad Max 2', and most of all the hilarious helicopter pilot. You had such empathy for their fate and rooted for Mel Gibson all the way. 'Fury Road', just might be the most spectacular of them all but it's perfectly flawed."
" 'Waterworld' Set In The Desert, But Not As Good.
",-0.4782,-0.9875,2019-06-04 00:00:00,3,"As of the time of this review posting, this movie is carrying an 8.1 IMDB rating. Why? Did the reviewers come into this film really NEEDING to root for a character? If so, were these the character they really WANTED to be rooting for? If so, why? The male lead doesn't really say much for 90 minutes, and wears a mask for the first 45 minutes. Why are people rooting for Charlize Theron's character? And, why am I supposed to naturally dislike the guy with the mask who controls the water? I mean, he seemed really upset when his favorite redheaded milk machine got killed. And, his feelings were hurt when Charlize Theron broke their deal.... And, why are all of these desert dwellers so angry and pale?These reviewers would have given this movie high scores no matter who played the characters or what they did in the film. For some reason, supporting the Mad Max franchise makes pseudo film critics feel smart. Well, this movie sucks - the setting sucks, the writing sucks, the story sucks, and the franchise sucks. It's gross, it's stupid, and I don't care. 'Waterworld' (1995) was a better movie, and Nick Holt will always be Tony Stonem in this house. #BadMaxRealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

It's like a big puzzle which is put together rapidly in front of your eyes. Action in this movie is so great, that you sometimes can't register all that's happening on screen. Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson and Charlize Teron is great and deserves her share of praise too. In fact, far more than her ""Atomic Blonde"" 2 years later. Miller knows what he's doing and there is something passionistic in this movie. The whole idea which carries through the series of Max roaming the wasteland like some sort of a limbo, looking for redemption and hope. This is how you make a GOOD action movie. Everything is in it's place and you care for the characters. And the action will give you wet dreams. I give it 10/10 and I'm not exaggerating. It deserves it. If you haven't, go watch it and see for yourself. If I was being a nitpicker, only thing I can think of is little ""blah"" are the 3D effects, which are not needed, but like I said, it's just nitpicking."

" Pretty much ""meh""!
",0.5411,-0.964,2019-04-27 00:00:00,5,"The Movie seems to be pretty polarizing, which i see no reason for, some make it to be the masterpiece of the century other lable it as a trainwreck.I think most fitting is something in the middle, cause overall the stunts, scenery and effects were pretty nice. The movie has its strong points obviously in the action department. I think Theron did a pretty good job at portraying a tough girl in apocalyptic times and steals the show of Hardy that was somewhat lacking a chance to shine. A fine actor was wasted on a role that could have been played just as well by any 90s action movie hero ( Van Damme, Stalone, Dudikoff, Arnold)My main critique will be the failed world building, i get that this is an action movie but from what i know about the other mad max movies this just doesnt cut it. You get zero information or background about anything:what about the different tribes?what are these ghost vision Max sees, about?where do the breeding women come from?what is the back story of the different areas they pass through (salt flats, swamp)who killed the world? yeah who!?-what about the blood transfusion and tatoos on Max' backthe list is so long, they could have cut some action and throw in some scene where they are just driving and tell each other something or pass on some information for the girls and the audiance. Or some old dude just narrates it ,whatever. As mentioned by many other negative reviews the whole idea to turn around came a bit sudden, and their plan is to trap the main forces and take the city, evading a fight. Instead they just run straight into them. What kind of a dumb plan is that?I really love the post apocalyptic scenario, but i have yet to find a film that can fill it with life, most of the time you just get a very small glimpse at the world and what happened. Damn i want Information how the rest of the world is doing, how the whole situation came to be, how people survived and managed to build up a new society. This might be the worst movie in that regard in that genre with such a big budget."

The visuals are absolutely stunning and the special effects are up there with the best of the best. But, what really takes Mad Max to the next level is its subtlety. It uses subtlety in a way that not too many other films can, let alone action films. Sure, there is some dialogue that is too blatant in its goal to move the story forward but most of the world-building and plot movement comes not from dialogue but from everything else. The all-out action, the changes in scenery and the characters' general demeanor all help shape the world that the movie takes place in and tell the story.

" A good post-apocalyptic idea
",0.4404,0.9951,2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"It's a post-apocalyptic movie which features an enormous wasteland where many fight for survival using highly modified, petrol-fueled war machines. The plot is pretty good, having an interesting premise and being non-linear an mostly unpredictable. It's filled with complex characters, each with its own problems and purpose who ultimately end up fighting for their lives. The scenes look great, the action is intense, generating plenty of drama and suspense, while bringing something new from time to time just to spice things up and keep the story interesting. The actors are great, doing a very good job in impersonating such unique characters, making them likeable but also credible.In terms of downsides, I think that it could have had a bit more pace in some scenes as it tends to turn things to the boring side. It doesn't get there but a bit more pace could have done it much good. Also, the wasteland presented might be the perfect place for its vehicles to unleash their power but it seems a bit predictable, not leaving much room for something unexpected. Maybe a different choice of filming locations could have helped a bit in this department. But, by far what let me down the most was the wow-factor. It wasn't able to produce something that will blow your mind, something that will make you jump from your chair or chew your fingernails in tension. It's very good in all these aspects but not amazing.Overall, it's a movie which I enjoyed thanks to its plot, its characters but also thanks to its quality acting. The action plays an important role while some drama helps build up the great atmosphere. It could have done a bit more in terms of pace and predictability, limited of course to a couple of scenes which could have been improved, but overall it managed to be good and even very good in most aspects, providing a quality time watching it. Still, it's a bit far from impressive, fact which makes it a bit shy from the maximum rating."

Four years later it is free on Hulu and based on high reviews, also that I found out it is the original director, I thought I'd give it a shot.As others with real reviews have stated, it is one long car chase with constant explosions and extreme re-dick-ulous-ness. Alternatively, lot of people seem to love this movie for action and cinematography. However, the same type of bizarre car getting blown up over and over again is boring. Also the cinematography is not great. It is filmed with ultra dynamic range and there is little contrast (most certainly not shot with REDs). I don't call that good cinematography, just a stylized quality that makes it look like a real time rendered video game. In fact I would say that the action and camera work is atrocious because they need to rely on many fast cuts to hide none existent practical effects.Also, I don't get the premise because it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Max from the previous movies. This is more like an alternate universe where, despite limited resources in a post apocalyptic world, there are unlimited resources and Max has zero resemblance to the original Max. Also, somebody should have told Hardy that he is not playing Batman. He can speak in a normal voice and not grunt out overly raspy lines. They took about 66% of the way through the film to even start with any resemblance of character development and even then there really isn't any.So basically, the action is dumb (and very, very repetitive), there is nothing interesting about the characters or dialog, and there is no plot at all. I mean none at all. Start driving down the road with a big chase. Chat a little. Then turn around with a big chase. That is it.Now, if you think that the Avengers is the greatest movie ever made, theeeeennn this is right up your alley. If you are moderately intelligent, then don't do what I did. Skip this movie for the rest of your life. It is not worth watching even once."

I can't quite understand what is is about a dystopian vehiclular film where little is said, that appeals. But it does.It's an action film with almost constant movement, a visual feast, glossy and full of some great cinematography and superb stunts. Tom hardy and Charlize Theron are both great and say little. Both trying to ""become"" the characters, I suspect with little choice as the characters told you little about who they are.A stunning, dystopian, turbo charged visual feast of a film.

Furry Road is easily THE most overrated garbage sci-fi to EVER reach the big screen.
False Flag critics thought it was going to win BIG Oscars as a strike against the man for Feminism (or some garbage) but all it ended up winning were sound and FX awards, nothing important (well not the big awards!).
I was actually offended by the terrible story, stodgy acting and dodgy script.
It is EASILY one of the worst reboots/remakes/sequels of ALL time, which is a scathing review in an era where more than 70% of films that open in cinemas (circa 2010-2020) fall into this category.
I have loved Theron in the past, but her hyper feminism is starting to turn my stomach, Hardy/Max is the title character (sort of...) and had no lines, and when you could make them out, they were corny as hell in really weird inconsistent accents???
I wouldn't force my worst enemy to watch this movie and certainly wouldn't chastise ANYONE who wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minutes.
Everything in the movie except the consistent color pallet crumbles under even the slightest scrutiny.
In all honesty, anyone giving this more than 5/10 doesn't have a mind to review anything."

The action was intense, even the cars and outfits they were wearing were interesting to look at. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) is a glorious film that puts you in a world that is far out of society and gives us the most insane effects and moments that shock you and make you pumped at the same time. However, it is still a flawed film, here's why. There were unexplained aspects like the people in the swamp area or the flashbacks Max had. It's more or less open to interpretation for the viewer. I at least see the flashbacks as the people Max let down and the swamp people are...just weird. I honestly never figured out what they were. The story was also simple. Thanks to Nostalgia Critic on Channel Awesome, I figured out that the story was only a chase. If you look at the film the theme is there, and it can be either seen as genius or potentially lazy. I find it to be something with good intentions but kinda of a weird outcome. However, a lot of the aspects and characters in these story make this movie worth it to watch. 9/10."

Roaring diesel engines, endless sands, savage people fighting to last a little longer under the burning sun than their neighbors, and of course the vehicles!

" Mostly Illogical Flash
",0.0,0.6928,2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,"2 April 2017. This Max oddly puts Mad Max definitely in second place as Tom Hardy takes over for Mel Gibson. Hardy's character seems to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder with strange flashbacks that are never explained and never support the movie, rather they just distract from the storyline. Instead, Charlize Theron in the role of an Imperator whatever that is has the lead position and perhaps the only reason the movie wasn't titled Imperator was because to make money under the Mad Max brand. No wonder Mad Max is likely really mad through out the movie.What this new version and re-imagined Mad Max movie has going for it is its dazzling visual effects along with great new look of the various action sequences. The hyper-space of the photography sped up though seems more like one of number of gimmicks used in the movie. Instead Mad Max is all flash with very little in the way of emotional substance, with a thin storyline and not much in the way of character development. What redeems this movie in part are the few scenes were there really is an emotional connection between characters and there are a few, except for the requisite kill offs of a few prominent but secondary good characters.For those who love video games, this movie is for them, but for the rest of the audience who look for something in the way intelligence and meaningful plot, well, just be mad like Max is."

Nobody mentions the very thin character portrayals (repetition of expression / nobody wants to look unattractive in their behaviour on screen ) zero storyline, the pouting, the endlessly boring 1000 yard stares, superficial surface ""Hollywood Cool"" performances faking and confusing dramatic intensity for staged sexual poses and a cast doing there best to be ramp up 'the sexual' or 'sexually aggressive' won't save a poorly written action film with thinly built characters you feel absolutely nothing for. Some of the photography and some of the colour grading is beautiful but good look feeling anything for the characters as your watch this hyped up commercial cataclysm that tries its best to get you hooked on bare skin sex and violence but loses its way amidst the endless sand storms of overly long desert car chases.

" The Most Bad Ass Best Picture nominee since forever!
",-0.5267,-0.9949,2018-11-19 00:00:00,9,"Mad Max:Fury Road is George Miller's latest installment to the Mad Max franchise. I would give it an A, for how entertaining it was, and how well the story was made.
Mad Max: Fury Road is the most bad-ass Best Picture nominee since Martin Scorsese's 2006 crime movie, The Departed. When I watched Fury Road the first time, I had no idea that it was nominated for Best Picture. This movie was nominated for Best Picture! That is insane, I mean out of all the movies they nominated, that was one of them. I am not mad, in fact, I love the fact that George Miller gets another shot at an Academy Award. This is the best Mad Max movie, according to everyone in the general population, and to myself.
What I think is nice about the Academy nominating Fury Road, is that if you are anything like me and your goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees, then you know that all you are watching are super depressing dramas, and every now and then a dramedy ( but remember that a dramedy is still a drama). So it is nice to take a one movie break and watch a movie that is filled with violence and gore, and scenes of intense action. So when they nominate a war film ( that is rated R) it is nice because half the time it is just people killing other people. It is entertaining.
There was nothing in Mad Max: Fury Road that I really hated. The acting in it is good, it is well done, and it is entertaining as hell. What is there not to like. I will say that there is not excessive amounts of violence in it, so if you go in expecting that you will be disappointed. But all the violence in it is bad enough that parents wouldn't take the family to it, I will tell you it is nothing like Beyond Thunderdome.
Fury Road reminds me of literally every Fast and Furious movie, and I think you can understand why. It also reminds me of 2017s crime drama action movie, Baby Driver, I think you can see why ( yet again).
To recap, I think this is the most bad-ass Best Picture since ever. I give Mad Max: Fury Road an A, for how it was entertaining as hell, and how well done the story was."
" finally a female driven action movie
",0.0,0.935,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I love this movie because it shows the equivalent of equal rights because it sends the message that parents have been telling their daughters forever which is you can be the hero of the story and you don't have to be beautiful or all dressed up. The direction is incredible and the screenplay is all over the place but the amount of action and character development more than makes up for a story that is incredibly hard to follow and doesn't make sense at times. The casting and acting are incredible especially by Charlize Theron as the first truly human female superhero and Tom Hardy as Max but a much more real human max in a sense but a war torn survivor who is not the hero of the story but still an important piece to the story. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" An apocalyptic and thrilling story set in the furthest reaches of our planet with lots of action , pursuits and violence
",-0.7351,-0.1074,2018-11-13 00:00:00,8,"This remake to Road Warrior is the best classic epic Post-Apocalyptic Action Science Fiction film in the Mad Max Franchise . An apocalyptic story set in a harsh desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life , within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. As a a drifter named Max (Tom Hardy) , and a woman named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) , both of whom rebel against a tyrannical ruler in search for her homeland with the aid of a group of female prisoners ( Zoë Kravitz ,Rosie Huntington-Whiteley ...) , and a psychotic worshiper called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). With the stark desert sands in front of them and marauders behind, only the maddest will prevail the storm. They fight brutal enemies thirsty for blood and to survive some battles to-the-death with lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit ,beheading, impaling and blow up . Only the mad survive. The future belongs to the mad .This stirring movie in comic-strip style is packed with unbelievable car stunts, thrills , chills and noisy action . Top-notch movie and well set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with a valient group who will have to fight against cruel cutthroats, a band of depraved crazies ; this thrilling picture packs kinetic action , chills, shocks and abundant violence . Spectacular stunt-work plenty of motorcycle races, cars witth breathtaking leaps and explosions . Excellent Tom Hardy as a revenger angel at one of his main roles, he embarks a groundbreaking escape against vicious murderous, he is a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos . And Charlize Theron gives a brave as well as sensitive acting as Furiosa, a woman of action and a warrior who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland .Rumbling and moving musical score fitting to action by Junkie XL . Special and weird futuristic atmosphere created by cameraman John Seale who reflects splendidly the barren outdoors . According to this cameraman the cinematography would be as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other post-apocalyptic movies, which typically have bleak de-saturated colors . Spectacular and impressive production design, the art direction is as beautiful as posible ; that's why the filmmaker Miller reasoned that people living in the post-apocalypse would try to find whatever scraps of beauty they could in their meager environment . Being shot in several locations such as Namib Desert, Namibia Cape Town Film Studios, Cape Town, South Africa , Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, Penrith, New South Wales, and Potts Hill, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia .The motion picture was stunningly directed by George Miller who subsequently announced he would sign on for ,three more Mad Max films as producer or director . Miller is author of the excellent post-apocalypse ¨Mad Max¨ trilogy along with the writer and producer Byron Kennedy. The first was ¨Mad Max¨ (1979) by George Miller with Gibson ,Joanne Samuel , Hugh Keays-Byrne ,Steve Bisley . A sequel titled ¨Mad Max 2, the Road warrior¨ with Gibson , Bruce Spence, Vernon Welles and Mike Preston . It's followed by ¨Mad Max beyond Thunderdome¨ with Tina Turner, George Ogilvie, Frank Thring and again Bruce Spence as sympathetic helicopter pilot . In addition, numerous imitations as the recent ¨Doomsday¨(2008, Neal Marshall), rip offs, and exploitations ,especially Italians products. Rating : Good, better than average, this is one of the most successful of the present decade . This remarkable action film will appeal to Science Fiction buffs. Rating : 8'5, Above average. Well worth watching."
" A mixed result

The trouble is that the action is almost non-stop. The scenes aren't repetitive or dull but their excess seems to put the film out of balance and in need of more breaks for other story-related elements like character development and letting the audience know why people are doing what they are doing.The film editing also seems less than stellar during these action scenes. Improvements might have helped viewers in keeping up with what was being done by whom against whom. Also, as most characters in the chase scenes are white, bare-chested men with shaved heads, it was almost impossible to tell them apart.There was an interesting addition to the story of a small tribe of women of various ages, most of whom were over fifty. To include such a group is a step forward for a big-budget Hollywood film. But overall, the flaws and lack of balance left an incomplete feeling."

Furiosa (Charlize Theron) whose name sounds like a Harry Potter spell, absconds with a group of women and heads east toward ""the green land."" She is pursued and confronted and that is basically the story in a nutshell. Mad Max (Tom Hardy) who can't recall his name, becomes a prisoner, universal donor, hood ornament, fighter, ideas man, and a fuel injector. His lack of dialogue made him a rather boring character and when he spoke, they weren't gems like other little speaking characters...""I'll be back.""In spite of the limited personality of the title character, the rest of the film is action packed as goes the Hollywood remake trend to please the younger audiences who prefer video game action over an involved plot. The left has proclaimed this a ""feminist"" film due to the role of Theron as a leader rebelling against the order and will of men. There may be a message there somewhere within the recess of what amounts to a shallow popcorn film, but I didn't desire to think that deep.The action is almost non-stop. This would have an appeal to those who love monster trucks, dirt bikes, pretty girls, and demolition derbies.Now at one point, there is a discussion of traveling in one direction for 160 days on bike.

The music is great and well used, adding a bit of tongue-in-cheek to the proceedings. Although there isn't much to the plot and the dialogue is minimal, this adds to the strong atmosphere; everything is just a little bit mad.

" Fury road is nothing short of a masterpiece.
",-0.7902,0.9301,2018-09-28 00:00:00,10,"First off, let me start off saying that people who are giving this movie one star and claiming that it's mindless action, is not only wrong, but mindless themselves. 
It's true that Fury Road is a movie that can be enjoyed without thinking too much, its also true that's its a movie which has required an INSANE amount of work to produce. There are so many details in the movie, that one could watch it ten times and still discover new things. Its a visual masterpiece and probably without exaggeration the best looking action movie ever made. 
to people claiming that its not well written, that is partially true. This movie wasn't written, it was story boarded - but writing good action sequences is one of the hardest thing to do as a screen writer and this movie has one amazing action sequence after the other. The plot is simple, but works. A henchwoman rebels against a tyrannical leader and frees his concubines and a chase ensues. Its a minimalist plot, but it works brilliantly.so do yourself a favor and don't listen to the critics, because this movie is going down in the ages."

",0.0,0.9683,2018-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Mad Max: Fury Road has been an aficionado to the predecessor, but we can not deny that it is dynamic, nostalgic and thrilling, but it has given very little to an AAA movie. The budget was also the cradle based on historical details that George Miller and Mel Gibson have embedded in a steam-punk atmosphere and have a good actor in Tom Hardy.
But you did not come up for something, you're the story of the first twenty minutes of an AAA movie, flat and nothing to say. It's great to be able to reconsider that our hero gets from A to B and then returns. In 2015, this is little, it does not have the plus of less money and the worse actors could have brought such a quality. It was good for her to be happy with Tom,
let's continue our saliva on the nostalgia train and into a seemingly long journey through which a stomach asthmatic old man runs. In sum, Mad Max: Fury Road 6/10, can be viewed and endured once, but nothing more.

",0.0,0.4759,2018-09-11 00:00:00,8,"It may sound strange, but that's probably why this movie stands out as watchable compared to every other hollywood product in recent years. you see, americans have these rules how you're supposed to write stories, what they have to include, and how characters need to be built. I'm seeing it all the time on pinterest, ""steps to include in your story"". what? no! you can't write like that. well, obviously you can, but if you think that there are mandatory steps for a story, you can then also write a bot to spew up stories for you.. and it feels like hollywood is doing just that. they press a button ""sci-fi"" and machine prints out a sci fi script. 
it is well established fact that hollywood never wanted to be paying it's writers, and now they have replaced them with robots. they don't have to pay at all.
since this movie didn't have a script, it's actually good, compared to everything else. it works, it's raw, you believe the characters, they feel more natural than almost all other recent characters.
I guess my point is, if you can't produce a script that makes you stunned or if you can't produce a movie with no script at all, probably don't make a movie..."

Halfway through I just accepted the film for what it was and let it continue to take me on a nail biting crazy ride.This film takes the previous Mad Max films and cranks it up to 11. Importantly though I feel that Miller didn't just do this to get bums on seats, he did it because this is the natural progression for the series. This is what happens when people have lived without civilization for so long.I'd love to see where the franchise takes us next.

On the 13th time watching it ,this film is truly a huge masterpiece. Everyone call other movies such as Aliens or Terminator 2 as the greatest action movies including Die Hard from 1988. I defiently agree with them but Mad Max Fury Road is the greatest action movie ever made.
From the first shot until the end ,this movie is just an incredibly powerful chase which never stops for a moment but it really has deep story and thought-provoking themes.
Tom Hardy replaced Mel Gibson but Hardy is awesome the same as Gibson ,let's not talk about the incredible Charlize Theron.

The story is just insulting. The good guys run away from the bad guys, their car breaks down, they fix the car, they keep running. This is the whole movie. There's no point to this plot. It it so stupid. Acting wise, no stand out performance(s), pretty mediocre. The CGI is really bad at times. And the ending, it just proves that the movie is completely pointless and you have wasted hours watching this garbage. I don't mind action movies that just try to entertain with a weak story, but there's no entertainment to be found here. I could rant all day about this piece of crap.

" A fun action-packed ride but lack of plot is very noticeable
",-0.2023,-0.273,2018-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Literally the only thing that holds this movie back from being truly amazing is the fact that it's got such a weak plot and script. Couple of rogues travel out into the middle of nowhere to the woman's homeland, then basically head back to where they started out from all the while being mercilessly harassed by the various hunting parties/clans or whatever you want to call them. That's pretty much the long and short of it. Hardly any character development to go with it which just makes the plot even more redundant. The two main actors, Hardy and Theron, are dreadful on screen. No chemistry whatsoever between the two and apart from some occasional (and weak) dialogue, the main interactions they tend to have with one another is either fighting or pointing guns in each other's faces.James Cameron said it himself, ""When you're making a movie, if you have a good enough story, everything else will fall into place and you'll have a great film"" and that's not just coming from any ordinary film maker, that's coming from the guy who directed Titanic. George Miller should definitely take notes!Obviously the one thing this movie will shine for is the visual effects and the action sequences. I admit they are ridiculously well done and it is a very entertaining movie to watch if a bit of mindless fun is what you're after. In terms of action, Fury Road hardly lets up for a minute and is entertaining as hell from start to finish, but falls short due to its dull plot and a complete disregard for character development. Fury Road is very much one of those Yin and Yang situations, you're either going to love it, or hate it. Check it out anyway; it's definitely worth seeing at least once."

",0.5859,0.914,2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"While I wasn't overwhelmed with this movie as a whole, there is no denying that the action sequences were over-the-top in the best way possible. Costuming and design was brilliant along with some outstanding stunts and effects. I enjoyed the action and thought that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron contributed all they could. It's an action movie and that's about it.I guess I expected a little more substance being a fanboy of the prior films. In fact, I think Thunderdome is still my favorite for the amount of humanism in it. Maybe that's the point I missed, that people are pretty much gone. Humanity is a relic of the old world. But it's more than that. It seems like this script is more what you'd expect from Hollywood - the villains don't get to be human anymore, they're too busy being archetypal bad guys, only the heroes get the opportunity for redemption. I don't like black and white characters and everyone felt pretty flat.The visions that Max had were just odd to me too. They seemed way out of character for him. I know he's a tortured soul, but I felt like we were missing something. He's always been the reluctant hero that ends up saving everyone but himself. I've always hoped Max would maybe stumble across Never Never Land one day and find a new way, but this is just a reboot, not a continuation. Too bad."
" I don't understand the hatred on this movie
",0.5216,-0.9887,2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,"I was 30 when I watched the first Mad Max installment. I was expecting more action in1980. Watching this ""remake"" of the second installment taped in 1982, I finally got the action I wanted then. Boy, this is ACTION, no kidding, and not for the faint of heart. This one is so we'll done that you immerse in the it and have to remember you ought to breathe from time to time.I now see that the subtle message of first Mad Max: in 1979 the fundamental prediction of the current progressive thinking, the last vestiges of the law to attempt restaining vicious gangs. Max, an officer without any legal support, is left without any options but to take the law on his personal hands against those who killed his wife and son. It is clear the Justice system cannot help him. Max becomes a brutal revenger hunting down and murdering those who had the law ""protection"". In fact, this is very similar to today's human rights or progressive groups more worried about those who violate the law instead of those who are victims or those who are in compliance with the law."

The pacing of the movie is great - it is slower paced, but yet you're never bored and it never *feels* slow. Miller does a superb job of bringing to life the world he has created.Another great thing I love about this film is that Miller doesn't go crazy with CGI - in a day and age when it seems nearly every movie uses way too much of it - this movie feels very organic and it looks amazing because of it. This movie will hold up for a very long time. I can't wait for a sequel to come out! (hopefully one does!)"

If there were characters in this movie, I'd probably care more about the action.Visuals - This movie looks kinda fake with all the bright colors. Doesn't stop it from being cinematic. The fight scenes are really good, and the overall look of this movie is great. There is a lot of sped-up footage though. Sounds - The soundtrack was good at first, but then they keep reusing the same scores and it got boring.

",0.6249,0.9994,2018-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Perhaps the blood rushing constantly doesn't allow you to fully process what you actually just saw, but after checking out the bonus features, you have to realize that besides digitally removing certain things and enhancing colors, every stunt you see was actually performed-- and usually at top speed. I'm talking about blowing up huge trucks, flipping cars, motorists jumping over vehicles, and so much more. Easily my favorite are the pole-rider guys; you may remember them from the trailer on these huge poles to swing from one vehicle to another. Yeah, guys trained for weeks to be able to do that. And I might as well say, kids, no matter how cool it looks, I only give you permission to attempt these stunts as long as you capture it on video so that I can laugh at you later.Now I can go on and on about these epic stunts and explosions and kills and action and fighting, but even that doesn't give the movie full justice, for it is one of the most fully-realized movies ever. George Miller had this brilliant vision, and the product is a story told with hardly any lines spoken by the main character-- or other characters for that matter. The women are given strong roles to emphasize their importance, not feed on weakness, and the message Miller gave his unit was loud and clear and wonderful: Even though this is a post-apocalyptic world, that doesn't mean it has to be bleak and lifeless and bland. This movie is vibrant and beautiful. To put focus on how humans would actually scramble to find remnants of beauty in a forsaken world is a great twist that enhances the story and the experience.Now let's talk about the Oscars. And there's a lot to talk about. This film won 6, all these very technical awards including his wife winning for editing, and nominated for 4 others. Not only did Fury Road win these Oscars, but it had to beat The Revenant to do so. Granted, that masterpiece beat it in directing and cinematography, but that's rightfully so. I think a lot of people were questioning why an action flick was winning all these awards from an academy that is known for excluding action, superhero, and blockbuster flicks. I am so glad it was recognized that this high-octane movie had such a vision that came together like nothing else. It's so hard to compare it to the other Oscar nominated films, but it is also really hard to compare it to action films in general. Generally, you have the opening action sequence, background of characters, perhaps a twist halfway through, then a balance of action scenes and talking scenes with a huge climax. And that is not Fury Road. My favorite vehicle from the armada is the huge cargo truck hybrid with drummers beating on the back and a guitarist suspended with strings jamming out and unleashing flames (it's an actual flamethrower guitar). That to me embodies the movie. A weird, weird world full of rocking characters on a chase set to a score with an equal amount of pounding drums and quick guitar jams. It's so cool, but still so intricate with the suicidal half-lives who follow Immortan Joe.This film changes the game. The progressively more intense sequences keep piling up for some of the most fun you'll ever have at a movie. Will other movies follow suit? And more importantly, how does George Miller create a respectable sequel after this?You can check this review and dozens of others out at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com"

" Furious disappointment
",-0.7906,-0.7379,2018-05-14 00:00:00,4,"First of all, I must say that I am a fan of Mad Max, both the decline of its social ecosystem and the artistic aesthetics of each of the films. Fury Road clearly try to be part of that post-apocalyptic ecosystem, but the great disappointment is in the poor development of the characters, if not because everyone knows that Tom Hardy is Max, could perfectly be a character surviving a poor script , a Max full of visions but without personality or history or humor. Two hours of chase with stuntmen jumping from one truck to another and many faces painted white are not enough to convince us that we are watching ""Mad Max 4"", or are simply selling us a trailer for the next ""Mad Max 5"", alredy announced.It is not a bad action film (just look at the nominations and awards), but it is not Mad, it has no history, or the little history that surrounds Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) does not catch. It is surprising that having Miller as director, the focus has been lost so widely."
" Arguably the best action film ever made
",0.4939,-0.9672,2018-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury RoadIt is unbelievable that Mad Max: Fury Road's director George Miller made Happy Feet and Babe but then he also made the original Mad Max and hence that statement should be the other way around. Of course, since this is almost 30 years since that Mad Max, the new version is at least 30 times grander. Somewhere George Miller is yelling ""My movie's action will speak louder than words"" and that's exactly what the film does. It is a visual spectacle that redefines the sheer pace of an action movie narrative. Almost 90 minutes of the 120 minute movie happens on dirt-kicking moving vehicles which just refuse to slow down. When the vehicles stop you are gasping for air and feel like taking a shower but before u can regain your senses those mutated vehicles are running again. Of course, words are not important, whenever the action quietens you have stunted B Movie dialogues which could have been better except for this hidden gem ""Hope is a mistake, if you cant fix whats broken you will go insane."" My only grouse with the film though was that whenever there is an opportunity to show unbridled gore, Miller flinches (maybe cause a NC-17 threat was peeking over his shoulder) but the movies jarring metal soundtrack makes up for it. The star if not 'the action' would be by far Charlize Theron as Furiosa, a cold and calculating rebel who has balls of steel and then there is Tom Hardy as Mad Max who is more insane than Mel Gibson could ever get. See his eyes dart to and fro in a crucial climax scene. The guy seems dead inside much like the desolate wastleand he dwells in and yet there is a craziness which lurks in him. Mad Max is not a perfect film and may age poorly but it is definitely the most exhilarating film you would see in a long time. One Word: Epic!"

Now Fury Road...
I was a child when the former mad max movies came out and I don't recall watching them, maybe I watched part of the 1st one, but at least I remember not caring about them. Who or what was mad max? Couldn't care less.
Fast forward to 2015.
I saw a tram with the movie poster on it, and the tagline the future belongs to the mad, caught my attention. I mulled over it and a desire to watch the movie was awoken.
Ladies and gentlemen. This has been the one of the best movies I've watched this year.
2 hours of sheer madness. MADNESS.Witness me blood bag
What a lovely day
I die, and I live again The best quotes were made by the guy I was wondering why he was not killed.
Favourite hilarious scenes were of the guy playing a flame throwing guitar with massive speakers atop a moving vehicle. Sheer madness.
I don't know what nay sayers are expecting in a mad movie.
I wanted entertainment, and I got extreme mad entertainment. Acting was the way it was supposed to be mad. Action sequences were the way they were supposed to be mad, intense, extended, and hilarious.
I rate this 10 out of 10, and will watch it again.
The future belongs to the mad."

This new bloke whatever the hell his name is tries to pass off a pitiful Australian accent and sounds more like a cross between a South African and a New Zealander not to mention he has no heroic qualities in this movie. He's more like the enemies then the girls bitch. A victim describes his character better.
I'm not even going to talk about the garbage plot.
You know what George Miller missed in this movie? Byron Kennedy who i now believe had the ingenuity of a story teller for the mad max series.

" Proved me wrong
",-0.4767,0.9301,2018-03-15 00:00:00,8,"This was better than I was expecting, even with all the rave reviews I just didn't think I would like it as I'm such a huge fan of the originals. I figured it would get Hollywood-ized with Charlize Theron looking like a post apocalyptic starlet, all pretty and clean and then CGI'd so that it lost that cool unique atmosphere of the original. Neither of these things were true.Set in a sun parched post apocalyptic future, we again follow loner Max (this time he is Tom Hardy) as he gets caught up in the plight of a group of warrior women as they flee from an evil ruler/dictator across a desert wasteland. Most of this movie is one big car chase, which actually isn't a bad thing, full of high octane stunts its pretty awesome and also keeps the atmosphere and tone of the originals perfectly with lots of weird, crazy characters. Its desolate, futile and Hardy is mostly silent. Theron does a good job, doesn't look pretty.Even though I was surprised that I enjoyed this and that ultimately it is a good movie I'm still not sure it warranted all the accolades it received."

If you watched it, name one thing you learned about Max during this entire film that you didn't learn in Mad Max or The Road Warrior. Can't do it? That's because the movie mainly focuses on Furiosa. Great. Cause that's why I go to see a Mad Max film. There's a seen in the movie where Max says he's gonna go get some supplies and will probably not come back. You then see a explosion, and Max coming back with a bunch of ammo. Wow. The one thing I came to see in this movie, and it won't even show it to me. For people who haven't seen it, DON'T! You can watch this movie, but go watch the original two movies first, then watch this. You might understand why people are giving this bad reviews. Some ideas are cool, but the movie just loves to spit all over the original fans by constantly destroying the V8 Interceptor and give him a double barrel shotgun that doesn't even work. Great idea. Insult the fans who came from a good movie. Fantastic."

But those are the tenets of any action movie, anyhow. Not taking itself too seriously, Fury Road is humorous in the sense of Schwarzenegger's Terminator movies. As a person who can hardly sit through any action movie, I found this one fun to watch."
" Utterly Pointless & Severely Overrated!
",-0.553,0.9919,2018-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I totally love cinema's action genre, always going easy on it. When the latest Mad Max movie first came out, I was pretty disappointed in it. Then all the acclaim and awards started pouring in. Is film dead? Did I just have a bad day? I rewatched it and my initial thoughts have been reaffirmed. The 1/10 I'm giving this is just a bid for this overall rating to lower. Otherwise I'd be giving this 5/10.It made sense for a Mad Max movie to be made now because of the massive upgrades in computer technology. That and it seemed like a nice cash grab. After all, the movie does have a better overall look than the three previous instalments. That's really about it in terms of what this movie has that's better than the others.'Mad Max: Fury Road' is not about anything. The characters are flatter than paper and the story stays in one spot throughout the whole thing. All it is is people driving in the desert with occasional explosions. The audience is expected the care about these characters just because. With underdeveloped characters why should we care? It is super rare when we care about an underdeveloped character. In 'Saving Private Ryan,' Giovanni Ribisi's character was underdeveloped but we felt tremendous remorse upon his death. Nothing that smart ever happens in this.For reader's sake, I will try to give a good summary of the plot. It is after the apocalypse (obviously), the human race is being enslaved (obviously) by the new leader (who is actually cool looking) who has many funny, half-naked Uncle Festers. Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is like a stuffed animal in front of a car and the Uncle Festers try to capture an escaped Charlize Theron. So that's it. There's really nothing more it it than that.One good aspect of the film is the cool images. The Uncle Festers, although cornier than their 80s counterparts, actually do look cool. There's one Fester with a sewn chelsea grin that I liked. The lord guy is pretty awesome and the frequent use of the skull logo is pretty badass. But not all of these are perfect. There's a guitar player on the front of a car that plays and shoots fire while the battles happen. But there's no point in him other than to look cool. The fire that shoots out of his guitar don't do anything. Some cars have tons of spikes that look cool, but they all explode right away. There's no point in having these images other than to look cool.There have been several analysis's about the movie's depiction of survival and feminism. Every movie ever made has themes! Fury Road's use of them are unoriginal and uninspired.On the whole, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a subpar action movie that is NOT one of the best action films ever like so many people say. It is literally just driving with occasional explosions and shootings. I knew this would find an audience like early Chuck Norris and Van Damme films did, but the critical acclaim and commercial success this has received is horrible. Do yourself a favour and just skip this.2/4"
" Close to a perfect action film
",0.5719,0.8413,2018-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic film, probably the closest to being a perfect action movie than any other. The Black & Chrome edition does enhance some scenes, but is overall inferior to the regular edition. The scenes where the image is sharp is better looking in B&C edition, while the rest of the movie looks better in color because the image is softer. I think the softer images are the product of using software to artificially reduce the shaking. This isn't noticeable in the regular edition because of high contrast color. On the other hand, instances where the images are sharp don't look as good in color because the extremely sharp images with high contrast are distracting -- this isn't a problem in B&C edition."

Logically, when the fourth installment aired on French television, I was beyond excited. Well, Fury Road definitely lived up to my expectations.(+)
Every character has a real purpose and follows through with it.Junkie XL as the soundtrack. I swore all along this was him (Junkie XL is also responsible for soundtracks such as 300: Rise of an Empire - which was admittedly way better than the film itself).The imagery. The artistry. It's a splendid film, which we don't see often in the action genre. The color palette is incredible, as well as the contrast. For most of the run, there's a lot happening on screen but the viewer is never lost in it.The editing is just as superb.Practical effects everywhere ! Another reason why it all looks so good (According to director George miller, 90% of the visual effects in Fury Road were practical), the stunts are impressive.(-)
I was left a bit perplexed as to why Norse mythology was mentioned/used by the War Boys. I might have missed something, but this felt a bit out of place to me, especially since one of their opponents was actually called ""The Valkyrie"".Mad Max: Fury Road was an exceedingly satisfying experience, I felt like all my senses were tingled and the first chasing scene with the War rig, the Buzzards and Immortan Joe's War Boys had me sitting on the edge of my seat - I was literally leaning forward, towards the screen, almost squinting by the end and letting out a little sigh when it did. The person I was watching it with had the exact same reaction and did exhale too, we were just that immersed.
The film manages to keep you interested despite a linear, simple story. It's all about survival, redemption, resurgence and hope; nothing original, nothing we haven't seen before, but George Miller succeeds on making it feel new, on creating empathy from us viewers for its (although numerous) mains. Also, and as the poster shows, the real main in this film is none other than Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a good (nearly silent) second lead.Ultimately, Fury Road is proof you can make a beautiful movie with complex characters, female leads, a feminist subtext, violence, and a whole lot of action, all of that while appealing to a large audience. 10/10."

In fact, I think it is the worst action-movie I've ever watched!Sure, it'll work as background noise while chatting on a day of severe hangover. But ... Nah, if you want to watch a proper movie with a story, where the characters actually speak, something unexpected happens, the characters evolve etc., any other movie will do."

",0.7249,-0.9539,2018-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Can't believe it -- just when you though Hollywood was out of ideas, Miller's masterful reworking of the original premise is a masterstroke of ironic surrealism. The acting is solid and complete lack of story and character development just could not be better. I will be forever in debt to the deftness with which Miller's addition to the Mad Max corpus honors every aspect of the satire genre -- completely coloring within the lines of vapid meme rehash, endless regurgitation of thematic tropes to cue audience to his earlier work, while at the same time cheapening and satirizing the Mad Max arc to a degree to which pales in comparison to Lucas's utter destruction and posthumous capitalistic Disney rape of the the past two installments of the Star Wars franchise.Just stunning."

Character development was nonexistent. The very long list of ""goofs"" (continuity errors) is not surprising. It wasn't even generic macaroni and cheese, just annoyingly awful."
" Stonk-boggeringly awful
",-0.4588,-0.992,2018-01-16 00:00:00,2,"Mad Max Fury Road is loud, obnoxious, shallow and tedious. I honestly cannot think of the last action film I saw that I found to be so boring and painful to watch. Jettisoning such superfluous elements like plot, characterization, pacing, structure or purpose, Fury Road is left as little more than a non-stop 2-hour car chase.There's beauty in simplicity to be sure (like Duel, or The Road Warrior for that matter), but the action in this film lacks any sense of progression or pacing. There's practically no meaningful transition between full-blown action and dreary overwrought dialogue - the film is either screeching up to 11, or not at all. And while the stunts themselves are indeed impressive for their practical feats, they soon get lost is the film's incessant white noise - at the end, I couldn't recall a single set-piece from Fury Road, just the sensation of a pounding headache.Not that the 'story' parts are much better - despite having a strong pair of leads from Hardy and Theron, the supporting cast ranges from passable to positively awful. Even said leads aren't given much to work with aside from the occasional grunt or maybe even a strained attempt at actual drama. But these ring hollow and feel unearned in the film's mindless muddle. There can be great power in a simple story, but Fury Road feels less like a big-budget B-movie than it does a standard Hollywood story with all the non-explosive beats cut out of it (more so than usual I mean).The scenery is spectacular to be sure, but it's also drowned in overly saturated shades of orange (during daytime) and blue (day for night) that make the whole setting look strangely fake despite the emphasis on practical effects. This isn't helped by the obnoxious editing, which makes heavy use of sped-up footage to pace the action scenes. This technique really does baffle me - yes, it was present in the originals, but does this really justify using a crappy technique that makes such scenes feel artificial and irritating to watch just for the sake of homage or nostalgia?I don't usually like using the phrase ""I don't understand how people can like/dislike X"" since it just gives the impression that you've stopped trying to engage in any meaningful discourse or in trying to understand different perspectives. However, the acclaim behind Mad Max Fury Road really baffles me - this film seems to execute the worst habits of modern Hollywood blockbusters in the worst possible way, and yet has received universal praise from almost every quarter. I usually have a positive lean with movies, including those often disliked by others (such as Prometheus or Jurassic Park 3), but there's practically nothing in Fury Road that resonated with me on any level. Unless you count the migraine I received once this furious journey finally spluttered to a halt.So that's one star for the spectacular Namibian scenery, when you can see it, and another for Theron, who really does deserve better material than this. Fury Road seemed to satisfy the vast majority of audiences; I just wish I could be among them."
" Definitely one of the best action flicks ever made
",0.7845,0.44,2018-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road is, hands down, one of the best action movies I've ever seen. It doesn't take its own sweet time with exposition, with dialogue or with establishment, it's just raw action from start to finish. It takes viewers on what is literally a non-stop ride through the desert, racing all the way to the end.I haven't watched any other Mad Max movies, but there's no need to watch the other three before watching Fury Road; everything still makes sense. The story follows Max (Tom Hardy) as he finds himself helping a driver of a war rig, Furiosa (Charlize Thereon) and her cargo of five women make their way through the desert. But there's a mob of in upwards of fifty vehicles behind them, hunting them down, led by the sinister Imortan Joe.Action movies are often slowed down by exposition and dialogue, and it's here that Mad Max: Fury Road excels. It doesn't waste it's time on exposition, not one bit. What's Valhalla? Why do the half-childs need blood sacks? Mad Max doesn't waste its time trying to explain every little detail, and it doesn't need to; the viewers just accept the absurdity of what's going on, letting us focus on the action. And that's the thing; the absurdity of everything is just so genius. Why is there a man playing a guitar on a truck? Who cares, just enjoy the movie!And the movie doesn't waste its time on dialogue either. This review is already longer than all the words Max says in the movie combined. It's just plain genius; Max is just this raw action hero, and we don't need his wild backstory, with him talking every second. We get to just watch this movie without the normal incessant dialogue of an action flick.That's where this movie definitely cements itself as one of the best action movies of all time. Never before do I think I've seen a movie that just has such non-stop action from the start to the beginning. The film must have a grand total of three static scenes where the protagonists just talk with one another. Everything else is just raw action, unfolding so quickly. The trucks chasing the war rig down are always in the horizon, and we're reminded of it just enough to remember the imminent threat posed to Max, Furiosa and everyone on the war rig. The actual action itself is so good; there's just so much, and the combat methods of both the attackers and defenders is so unique.The thing with Mad Max: Fury Road, is that it'll probably be the most unique action film you ever see. Right from the get-go the director throws us headfirst into a dystopian world, forcing us to just accept this and let the movie unfolds. And that's fine. Who cares how absurd everything might seem? Just enjoy the action!Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing action movie. I recommend it to just about anyone, and especially to action die-hards. You won't regret it."
" A disappointing sequel/reboot.
",-0.4939,-0.9821,2018-01-15 00:00:00,3,"'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' is one of my favorite films of all time and I was really looking forward to seeing 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. When I heard there was going to be a new Mad Max film I was excited at the possibility of it being a great sequel, considering how disappointing 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome' was.I was hoping for a sequel that would develop Max's character furthermore whilst building on the world the previous movies set up, considering the massive budget George Miller was given. I was hoping for an epic story with some depth, considering how the post-apocalyptic genre has evolved throughout the years through movies, books, video games, and television. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a horribly paced and horribly acted disappointment of a film. The action is extremely repetitive. The score is obnoxious. The editing is awful. The story is painfully basic. Character development is almost nonexistent. Character's make decisions without logic or reason. Max is pretty much a completely different character. In the original films Max was portrayed as a believable human being whereas in this film he is portrayed as a ""crazy"" cartoon character.The only good things about this film are it's production design and use of practical effects.Overall the film is a massive disappointment."

Then they turn around immidiately and kill the villain on the way back, 40 min car chase.

",-0.1759,0.9599,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Mad Max: Fury Road' doesn't - to the best of my recollection - pick up from where the third film ended, which is fine, seeing as 'Beyond Thunderdome' came out the year I was born! I don't recall too many specifics from the original trilogy, other than it was a post-apocalyptic desert (Australian) wasteland and motorcycle and car gangs reigned supreme. 'Fury Road' keeps that tradition alive - at its core, it is a road/chase film, and is relentless throughout with everything it does, from the scenery, soundtrack, stunts, cars, violence and explosions.The over-the-top-ness serves the film well, though - much in the same way '300' was hyper-visualised, this is the same, but instead of heaps of slow-motion, some of it is sped up, keeping the pace of the chase buzzing. It also has the same silly-ness, in that none of it is remotely realistic, but it all works within the universe the film inhabits (except for where all the fuel comes from!). Miller must've dreamt up most of the car/truck hybrids when he was a kid - and kudos to him for making them a reality, especially the pole-swinging guys and the main rig - certainly great to watch.Hardy is satisfactory as Max (there's not many lines for the brooding hero) and Theron is good as the vengeful Furiosa, trying to protect a group of women from the evil Emperor (or whatever his name is - played by Keays-Byrne, with Billy Connolly hair). Not sure why Hardy had to have a Bane-like face covering for some of the film, after 'The Dark Knight Rises' - detracted a bit from the film. Favourite bit - the guitarist on the front of the truck! Loved how the drums and his riffs only came to the fore when the camera panned to them."
" Decent

It suffers from the same problem the third movie suffered from: too ""big budget"" and too much ""flare""."

" Stupid movie.
",-0.5267,-0.9032,2017-11-19 00:00:00,1,"I really like the second Mad Max movie, it's pretty interesting and the atmosphere is unique, I am a fan of that movie. Mad Max Road Fury, it's just Mad Max 2 on the highway chase scene, but augmented. If it were just this, Road Fury would just be a passable and forgettable action movie. But director George Miller had the sad idea of transforming a series of action films with male focus, in a propagandist feminist product. Not that I have anything against feminists, but it's wrong for you to turn something that your fans like and turn into something different. Any defense that this movie may have, falls to the ground. The defenders of this film generally claim that the film no longer makes any political comment to the feminist side, and the film goes on to value that both sexes are equal at the beginning of the third act, since Mad and Furious (and the other women) work together to get saved from the pursuit of Immortan Joe. It would be true, but the way it is done, it's too simple and execution is not good enough (considering also the size of stupid things, which happens near the end of this movie, in which I'll speak closer to the end of the text). Miller just put it in the film, to save face, if Miller had the courage and the quality, he would have developed it from the beginning of the film itself, to culminate in a quality ending, but Miller had other interests, such interests to win awards and recognition , instead of doing something of quality. With this, Miller may have won some awards from the academy, after all when the car chase scenes begin and that awful song begins, you begin to visualize the wind heads in the academy awards jumping off the couch and starting dancing and jumping like crazy , and they begin to rave how the world is evil and the fault lies with men (the academy has ceased to be relevant since the late 1950s when it began to take political positions).Stupid, I know. If you do not belong to the rebel age group (16 years-26 years old) and you're not delighted with bad and second- rate music, then Road Fury is just a mediocre action movie with 3 scenes of car chases. Passable and forgettable. Not to mention Miller had the sad idea of leaving the third act of the film, with the characters coming back the same way they did in the first and second acts. Amateur.I do not forget the lousy acting of the film, with the exception of Charlize Theron, no one knows how to act. Especially the women of Immortan Joe who have most quickly stepped off the walkways of a Victoria's Secret event (e.g. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and from acting, these ladies do not know anything, for sure. Or the 60-70 (with a body with only 130lb) years-old ladies coming back with Max and Furious in the third act, who begin to beat men in their 30s and 40s with 310lb of muscle easily. Or jumping from truck to truck, or from vehicle to vehicle like rabbits, defying the laws of physics. Even as an action movie this movie is pathetic.Stupid movie, no doubt."

The action is super clear filmed so that we really see what happens there the story is told very linear so that everyone can understand. (Many say the story is so simple but I can not think outside the box because so little is said in this movie). The action is super filmed, almost praised, actors give everything they can only by facial expressions and gesticulating because very little is talked about in this movie the music is cool.

The dialog was also hard to follow at times, including some occasional Australian slang dialog that I had never heard before. If you want to understand it better, watch the movie on DVD with it set for dialog for those who are hard of seeing and hearing. Anyway, there is a lot lacking in the plot and characters, and the baby birth scene was sort of uncalled for in my view. And what happened to the baby???? I thought the Mad Max character was especially dull. BUT, this movie is the best I have ever seen as far as futuristic battle scenes go. It is Crazy, off the wall, creative, amazing, totally intense. AMAZING road battle scenes. WOW!"

They both are amazing in their roles. They have given one of their best and memorable performances. Charlize Theron was Superb as Furiosa and Tom Hardy totally rocks as Max. Tom Hardy is one my most favourite actor so it was truly a delightful experience watching him in this film. The action of the movie is simply the best. All the action sequences are breath taking and it is like a thrill ride from start to end. A touch of emotions too in the form of the main characters back story has added a lot to the character development, depth and intensity. The plus positive points of the movie are that the screenplay, cinematography, acting, action. stunts, dialogues, emotions, background score, music and little bit humor all are perfect.

" No Max or Madness!
",-0.6588,-0.784,2017-11-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie had everything. From war machines, to rugged vehicles, guns, action packed sequences. Everything but Max and his ""Madness"". This franchise were all about Max. His at times uncomfortable demeanor kept us excited every minute. Mel Gibson did a stellar job at this, at which Tom Hardy fails. He fails to deliver emotion or charisma of the character. He fails to capture the bitter experiences of Max. Well, flashes of some unrelated past events would not suffice! The character itself is frail in this installment. Max plays side-kick of Curiosa for the good portion of the run time. To be honest, I wanted to see Max and his Madness, which this movie failed to deliver.I would still recommend this only for its high quality and unique caliber of action."
" A masterpiece of death and destruction.
",-0.5423,0.286,2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max: Fury Road is everything I want an action movie to be and more. The action is spectacularly filmed, with cinematography that makes me salivate to think about. The pace is so fast that you never get bored and it constantly keeps your attention by having very little dialogue, making sure that you have to watch the film to get what's going on. The characters have a surprising amount of depth to them, with Furiosa being a huge standout among female action heroines. She's tough, but not emotionally cold. Competent, but not invincible. Her motivation to save a group of women from a patriarchal tyrant is immediately sympathetic and you root for her all the way to the end.Fury Road might not be the smartest movie in the world, but nobody can deny the craftsmanship that went into making what I consider to be the greatest action film of all time."
" Hell on Earth
",-0.6808,0.3274,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)They used GraveDigger the monster truck in this!! It would have been fun to be part of the vehicle design team as they were all wild, mean and powerful looking. This movie kept the vibe and atmosphere of the originals, dirty, grimy, gross and vast in landscape, to paint a picture of an evil overlord who enslaves people and withholds water in a hopeless desert land. During an escape attempt, Max encounters a few women and they begin to team up to escape the wasteland in hopes of reaching the women's homeland. Like many in this movie series, the plot felt thin and a vague and barely enough to contain the wild and spectacular car chase battles. This movie did not disappoint with its pure action which was well- choreographed, elaborate, full of dirt, blood, sweat and fire; a lot to visually digest on the screen. I wish this story had better character engagement or reward for watching as by the end I just felt dirty and that I needed a bath."
" like an 80's b movie...
",0.3612,0.7945,2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,so every.single.scene in this film is terrible writing and acting to the point of face palming. But the film is one long chase scene anyways thats going literally to nowhere and back again so i guess there isn't exactly a whole lotta dialog or even much else to say anyways. Only reason it enjoyed so much success is due to the sheer budget they threw at the film to distract you from any of the real content to the movie.

There's real depth and breath to even the smallest characters shown which makes the viewer just want to know even more about them. I'm not normally interested in this genre if there even is a genre here, but even on the small screen this movie was just too damn good to be believed. It was almost like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that it's hard to compare to any other movie — including the other Mad Max movies. So ... don't be turned off by the nay sayers and by the ""type"" of movie it is. Just watch it twice at least and try to ""be"" in that Mad Max world for a couple of hours. This is top class stuff from start to finish. And ... the music is great, too."

The world of Mad Max is completely absurd and rich with details, it's visually stunning and the action is well choreographed and never fails to entertain. And characters seem like actual human beings instead of one-dimensional stereotypes. I've seen this movie 6 times already and will probably watch it another 5 times in the coming year. It's awesome!"
" What does this say about us?
",0.0,-0.9458,2017-10-08 00:00:00,1,"On a cow pie scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10. Non-stop action to stretch a thin (and ridiculous) plot line to 2 hrs. Early on, Hardy's acrobatics are not simply the stuff of MA fighting. They are childishly unrealistic. He meets Theron, and it's obvious they are both running from the same common enemy - yet both continue to think they are adversaries. Perhaps in the future, all will have forgotten the fundamental principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Gas is scarce, yet everyone's chasing them with souped-up racers that burn more fuel in an hour than most of us do in a month. Bullets are prized items, yet somehow everyone's got oddles to spare - enough for Hardy to fire warning shots at the girls.As some have noted, the CG graphics are amateurish. Plot holes anyone? How about continuing to drive in a sand storm? Or supercharging your engine by pouring gas directly into the intake manifold. Uh, huh. Or on the return trip - presumably a few days later - the bad guys are still there, far from their base, waiting around for...what? Theron's acting is flat, perhaps more because of the script than her own limited range. Hardy is the better actor, but there's little for him to do with his wooden character. Probably more the writer's fault than the director's.What really bothers me is that so many think this is a really neeto keeno film. It isn't. It's not even good escapism. Character development is minimal for the heroes, and nothing for everyone else; the plot is thin and unconvincing, even if we stretch our credulity to a reasonable limit. The high opinion speaks to the loss of aesthetic judgement so prevalent in this country - perhaps loss of judgement, period."
" Unbelievable. Twice.
",0.2023,-0.9976,2017-10-04 00:00:00,1,"First ""unbelievable"" - it is that Mad Max franchise could be SO wasted. I am slowly (or even quickly) getting used to the lowering of quality in almost all sequels: they get worse and worse, year after year. But nothing prepared me for the Fury Road. It was almost uni-vocally acclaimed by the critics - it is the second ""unbelievable"". HOW could anyone like it? What can be possibly liked in that disastrous, pathetic movie? First - Mad Max himself. Where is Mad Max in this movie? There is just some pathetic loser who has no... Well, he has nothing. No charisma, no strength, no brain, no ideas, no mission - nothing. The rest of the characters - not better than Mad Max. The worst part is a bunch of the supermodels who apparently have just had their hair done, nails polished, facial and full makeup applied, in a world of dirty, ragged, ape-like cavemen. Where did they come from? They just doesn't fit. It hurts eyes and brain. The ""special care"" for them is not plausible (they would have to produce lipsticks, creams, powders, eyeliners and so on). The story - plain stupid. A ""Mad Max"" movie doesn't need to be very deep, it is action-oriented. But here nobody knows what and why she/he does, the decisions are random. We can not feel the story, it simply doesn't look real. We are not in this world, we don't experience it. We just sit in the cinema, watching something boring. By the way: it is Mad Max. But the lead character is some chick. I know nowadays girls MUST be the main characters in the movies (or a girl and a man). But if it is really necessary, why just not do a ""Mad Princess Maximme""? Why to do a laughable Mad Max? In all of the Mad Max ""old"" parts there was action, blood, violence, AND something deeper. Here is only action (violence is on a naive, kindergarten level). And it may sound paradoxically, but action is boring."

Another issue that not many people realize is the music score, which for me is very important, in this film just didn't glue with the dynamic of the gesture. The lack of development of the bad guy character who had a lot of potentials was also not exploited as it could.I did love the production design, the costumes and makeup are amazing, the photo is very good indeed, the cars rocked, and the cast is to dream of. I am very fond of the Mad Max saga, and this film was much expected, that is why is so disappointing that this ends up being just another good action movie when it was bound to be a major classic."

" An Uncompromising Action Movie
",0.0,-0.93,2017-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Mad Max is probably the greatest action movie I have seen until now. Its over the top action sequences, beautiful camera work, the setting, the cars and the fire breathing guitar truly create a post apocalyptic world of humans reduced to savages. George Miller gives you no time to adjust or comprehend the world he has created. The frames are hyperactive and the scenes are accelerated, the dialogue is barely audible and you're left on edge 10 minutes into the movie, and it doesn't slow down from there. The lighting and colors give this movie a different, more exotic feel than other post apocalyptic or action movies. Some of the action sequences were over the top, but others were very intelligently made. The performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron gave the film even more drive. The movie never side-tracks or brings anything that isn't essential to the full on action film that it is. I don't believe this film (alone, not including the prequels) was meant to introduce 3D characters with depth or have a philosophy behind it. But it does demonstrate, through its madness and chaos, that humans' most basic instinct, survival, creates this chaos and in that chaos eventually comes some form of civilization. I also couldn't help but relate the people in Mad Max's world to the ones in ours. I found many similarities, the core instincts of greed, power, need, survival, faith, loyalty, they're all there, they've always been there. The only difference is in the manifestation, the more the world progresses the more complicated is the manifestation of these instincts and emotions. But again this movie was probably not meant to demonstrate these things, but that just adds to my point."

But of course it's different to actually see it for yourself than just to rely on the opinions of others.It's clear that this movie is different from the typical action movies that we get nowadays from every f##king movie studio that exists. There's something unique in the story and of course visually this movie beats any other action movie out there. While the story is a bit dark and it has very serious themes in it, there's a somewhat loose feeling to it. The movie can be taken seriously, but there's a somewhat relaxed feeling to the things they've come up with. The filmmakers are pros and they know what they are doing, so if they want to add a flamethrower electric guitar in there, they can and they should - and it will be f##king awesome. That flamethrower electric guitar reminds me, since I haven't seen the original movies I can't help but feel that I'm missing something. Why is there a guitar and war drums on a car? Is that... normal? Is that a regular thing or is Immortan Joe just a drama queen who needs his own theme music? It's cultural stuff like that that I don't know, but in the end that didn't seem to matter that much. But at least it feels like there's a world outside this movie, that the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland has a culture, instead of just those three or four tribes we get to see.Mad Max: Fury Road may be a bit long, and definitely feels longer than it is, but it's worth it. The audience wants desperately to see what happen, they desperately want a happy ending, all that. I was on the edge of my seat, even though during the start of the movie I was indifferent towards it. Visually... I've never seen an action movie that looks like this. The editing is amazing, so are the effects, which might have something to do with the fact that they used CGI very little. But the cinematography... It's astonishingly beautiful. Every shot seems to be careful, and the colours are mind-blowing. Also the costume department has done such an amazing job, and all the vehicles look amazing... Everything in this movie just stands out from the typical post-apocalyptic action movie, and it's amazing.Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing post-apocalyptic action movie, that definitely stands out from all the s##t that's out there. It's different, original, and just so damn thrilling and beautiful. It's a f##king action movie masterpiece! What are the originals like? If they are anything like this, I have to see them!"

Visually, it is stunning––from the fast-paced chase/fight scenes, to the gorgeous cinematography within the barren, apocalyptic landscape.

There are environmentalist messages, feminist messages, political/government messages, and more just littering the film.

" A great action movie, uncluttered and straight to the point.
",0.7184,0.9674,2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max is a fresh take on action movies. 2015 was a year full of blockbusters and even so this one managed to stand out; it captures the essence of the previous movies while giving viewers a fresh take on Max and the newly introduced characters. The story, while not rich in dialogue or character introductions, provides all of their motivations by minimum dialogue and gives us a glimpse of backstories. The brides know nothing more of the life they've lived as prisoners or ""breeding stock"", and are chasing a better life although they have no idea what awaits out there. Furiosa, looking for redemption and an old home, hasn't lost hope and is looking out for the rest of the girls. Max, a hardened survivor, is looking only for that: to survive, not get involved in anything, and staying out of the way. Becoming unlikely allies for plot reasons doesn't feel forced but a necessity, as soon as the purpose is filled everyone takes their own way. As for who has the role of protagonist, there isn't really one and only. Both Max and Furiosa complement each other, and the plot drives them to stay together and have their own moments. It wouldn't be enough to have only one of them and the movie did an excellent job giving both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy enough development to make them have a good relationship while staying true to the Max character of being distant."

I heard the action was supposed to be impressive, but even that wasn't worthy of the hype or praise. Water World has way better action and is more interesting. The pacing is horrible.

" A Visually Stunning Film, A Thrill Ride
",0.6249,0.5187,2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Remarkable for its stunning visuals, ""Fury Road"" is part of the Mad Max canon that started with Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy plays Max in this film, but his role is overshadowed by Charlize Theron's performance as Imperator Furiosa, a driver for a tribal warlord. She goes rogue, stealing his property and dashing through the desert, hoping to find freedom and sanctuary.This is an action film that is nearly nonstop action. The story has twists that prolong the suspense so the chase never becomes boring.With stylistic references to ""Snowpiercer"", ""Star Wars"", ""Dune"", ""Star Wars"" and gladiator films, ""Fury Road"" is basically a retooling of the classic western. Imagine the wagon train speeding for safety while being chased by the Indian war party.The dystopian setting for the film is a brutal world where those who control the resources have all the power. Theron does a great job of portraying the tough warrior who can survive in such a world. Her physicality is totally believable and the product of months of training (undoubtedly aided by her dance training).Hardy provides a strong performance, but the script, especially in the beginning, inhibits his ability to express himself. The mythology of this film is pervasive and convincing. The settings, costuming, and the design elements, combined with a dramatic and impressive soundtrack, make ""Fury Road"" a beautifully choreographed dance of death. The editing is tremendous, deserving of the Oscar (one of six awarded to this film)."

" Practical Magic
",0.0,0.9238,2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"""Mad Max?' who's he?"" cry the younger generation. Well, I guess he's Tom Hardy these days. However, to anyone born back in the seventies and eighties, he the titular character was synonymous with a different actor who has since majorly fallen from grace. So, in short – it's a remake. But, in that most rarest of remake traditions, it seems that the general consensus is that it's actually pretty good! Now, I was never that into the original films (I can't even remember whether there's two or three of them!) so perhaps I'm more forgiving and not exactly a 'Mad Max' purist, however, perhaps one of the reasons this new version is so well received is that it's written and directed by the original's director, George Miller.It follows the same premise, i.e. in a post apocalyptic world (or 'Australia' as it's also known – boom boom!) gangs rule the deserts and fuel and water are the most rare – and therefore valuable – commodities that people will literally kill for. Enter one gruff loner (or 'Max' as we later find out) who's been surviving on the road all this time on his lonesome. However, his (sort of) carefree days of eating lizards and driving a cool car quickly come to an end when he's captured by a gang of those nasties who seem to come to be in every post apocalyptic world we've ever seen on screen. So he's tortured and killed and no one lives happily ever after. Just kidding. With the help of a load of other prisoners, he escapes and they all go on the run, hotly pursued by their psychotic former captors. However, just because you're on the run from people who want to strap you to the front of a high-powered vehicle and wear your skins for sun block, doesn't mean it's all bad. There are worse people to be on the lamb with than Charlize Theron (unless she's playing Aileen Phillips from 'Monster' I suppose!), so the pair of them do their best to fend off the constant attacks from the gangs, while protecting those who are escaping alongside them.I guess if you were to sum up the film and try to pigeonhole it into a genre, you could say it's an 'action' movie, but I think the sub-genre of a 'chase' movie is more in order. It never really stands still for long and the film is ultimately one long chase across a desert, only stopping occasionally to gather a breath or two before everyone's off blowing moving vehicles up again. And, if that's your thing, then you're in for a real treat. Part of the enjoyment of this (very simple) film is that many of the special effects are real life stunts, as opposed to CGI or blue-screen work (yes, I think there may have been a little bit of the afore-mentioned effects, but it's pretty minimal) so you really get a feel of the danger the actors (or probably stunt people!) are going through.Not only are the explosions all convincing, but the make-up is also really cool. And, by 'cool' I mean absolutely revolting! Although, it seems that in this dystopian future, only bad people are hideously mutated individuals and anyone who needs saving looks like a supermodel from a Victoria's Secret catalogue. Although, to be fair, it seems that once a woman stops looking like Cindy Crawford with slightly less make-up, if they still wish to stay on the good guys' side, they automatically become a hard-as-nails old crone who's got a heart of gold and a forehead that time forgot. Anyway, that's just me being picky, this film is fast-paced fun. If you like numerous explosions, car chases and general mayhem then go on a road trip with these people and you'll see how bad car travel can be – I promise you after seeing what these people have to endure you'll never moan again when all you have to do is drive a car with your kids in the back while they constantly ask, ""Are we there yet?"""
" Mad Max returns with a vengeance
",-0.4939,0.6525,2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Shell-shocked former cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy in peak rugged form) and tough warrior Imperator Furiosa (a fabulously fierce portrayal by Charlize Theron) join forces to protect a group of fertile women from the vile clutches of evil warlord Immortan Joe (robustly played to the monstrous hilt by Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his vicious minions.Director/co-writer George Miller keeps the lively and wildly entertaining story hurtling along at a relentless slam-bang pace, stages the thrilling action set pieces with rip-roaring brio, and brings a staggering sense of epic scope and crazy go-for-broke creativity to the infectiously over-the-top proceedings. Better still, Miller's tightly streamlined narrative pares everything down to the exciting bare essentials which in turn ensures that there isn't a single wasted frame or dull moment throughout. This movie earns extra points for its strong feminist stance in which a bunch of women who have been relegated to the status of property whose sole useful functions are either for reproduction or providing milk take a defiant stance against an oppressive patriarchy.Moreover, Max's struggle to regain his humanity and the redemptive character arc of the misguided Nux (a sturdy performance by Nicholas Hoult) give this picture extra depth and poignancy. This movie further benefits from a colorful array of outrageously nasty villains: Nathan Jones as dim-witted brute Rictus Erectus, Josh Helman as deranged War Boy follower Slit, John Howard as the grotesquely obese the People Eater, and Richard Carter as unhinged religious fanatic the Bullet Farmer. Kudos are also in order for John Seale's breathtaking widescreen cinematography and Junkie XL's dynamic pulsating score. An incredibly ferocious explosion of a film."

I don't think my opinion about any of the parts has changed, but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted. I'll say right up front, I don't think this is a bad film. A lot of it is more than a little exceptional. The action scenes, especially the final chase, are incredible. It's pretty much everything else about it that I could do without. The story and characters are pretty dumb. That's not a new thing ... it's pretty much true of all the films in this series, and it's what really buries the 3rd one. But in past films, none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive CGI and a ridiculously frenetic pace. If you consider ""The Road Warrior"", that film's grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives it's broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes. It's like a post apocalyptic western. This film feels like a cartoon, or maybe a video game. A really really good one, but still ... a video game."
" great new addition to the Mad Max franchise
",0.2263,0.998,2017-06-18 00:00:00,9,"People who are critical of this movie I'm guessing in large don't understand what a Mad Max movie is or were never fans of the original franchise in the first place. If you're expecting a deep, profound study on human behavior and richly developed characters, you'll have to look elsewhere...Max Max was never this, nor does it pretend to be. Mad Max is a hit you in the face roller-coaster ride of an action movie set in a sci-fi post apocalyptic future world. The elements of this movie are quite simple, just like the first 3 installments. Fast paced, violent action centered around situation survival. Complex character development and rich dialogue aren't needed here, nor does the film suffer from it. Mad Max Fury Road, like it's predecessors, doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it simply is. And that's the beauty of this movie. In a cinematic landscape full of thought provoking, profound films that often tend to be too highbrow for their own good, Fury Road was a welcome breath of fresh air. A guilty pleasure I loved every minute of.It should go without saying that the special effects, action sequences, editing and cinematography here were top notch...the Academy agreed as well, giving this film nominations and awards in many of those categories. Frankly, based on the weak competition that year, I feel the only reason Fury Road didn't receive Best Picture was because the Academy didn't have the stones yet to give it to a film like Mad Max.Sure, this wasn't any thoughtful film with a deep and profound message, nor was it claimed to be, but it was a damn good movie that blended all of its own elements together flawlessly to create an amazingly entertaining viewing experience. And in my opinion, it did so far better than any of its Beat Picture competitors.George Miller went out on a limb casting somebody other than Mel Gibson in the role of Max. Max is certainly a movie character that is very strongly tied to the actor who portrayed him. Using Mel in this film wouldn't have worked for a large number of reasons, and Miller knew this. Having said that, the character of Max isn't a particularly complex or deep one (Max had fewer than 20 lines of dialogue in The Road Warrior), any number of actors could have pulled the role off reasonably competently. But Mel Gibson did bring an important intangible quality to the role that made the character strong. Tom Hardy was an excellent choice to replace Mel Gibson as Max, he succeeded in bringing that same intangible value to the character. If Miller would have chosen a different actor who lacked this subtle quality, he wouldn't have been able to pull it off nearly as well as he did, nor would fans have been as accepting of the new lead. Hardy did a wonderful job as Max, and I hope we see more of him in this role in future films.Charlize Theron delivered her typical outstanding character performance here, stealing every scene she was in. She demonstrated why she is considered such an amazingly talented character actor, able to handle such a wide spectrum of parts. If you're a Mad Max, action, sci-if fan, or if you just enjoy very well done films, Fury Road is a must see"

" Road Warriors
",0.0,-0.8153,2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"Tom Hardy takes over the role made famous by Mel Gibson in this fourth film in the 'Mad Max' series. The plot has Max reluctantly team up with a renegade female trucker transporting the abused, pregnant wives of a tyrant to safety; distrust turns to mutual respect as the pair fend off attacks from the tyrant's underlings. Right from the opening monologue, 'Fury Road' feels like a decidedly different 'Mad Max' film; add in cutaways to Max's memories of a young girl and the action hero is more conflicted and haunted here than ever before. The film additionally does something different by giving Charlize Theron much screen time as the gutsy trucker with her own insecurities as she searches for her hometown as a safe place for the wives. These two angles do not mesh all that well together, with Max oddly relegated to a supporting character despite a deeper than ever glimpse into his psyche. The limited exposition also leaves open unanswered questions regarding blood transfusions, whether fertility is an issue and what everyone's obsession is with painting their teeth. Some elements (a rock guitarist strapped to the front of one truck) also come off as simply weird for the sake of it. And yet, if never entirely successful, there remains something to like in George Miller taking the material in new directions rather than just recycling what has been done before."

The story may not be the most sophisticated one (but tbh none of the movies of the Mad Max franchise are) but it gives what it promises: A trip on the fury road. A big bonus imo is especially all the ""analog"" done stunts - if I compare this with these Fast and Furios movies for example, where almost every action scene screams CGI, I am really happy to watch this ""traditional"" done action scenes, which are btw just stunning.Mad Max: Fury Road is just great and superb. I also like Tom Hardy as Mad Max (okay Mel I like more, but anyway) and Charlize Theron shows again that she can play all sorts/genres of movies and characters.I enjoyed and will enjoy this one greatly, and I am eager to see the next movie of the series. Imo we need some more - so we can binge watch this over a whole weekend. That's my future plan for living, an aim worth for staying alive ;) All thumbs up - well done, Mr. Miller!"
" Lauded as Great Action and Female-Empowering for a Reason
",0.6249,0.9936,2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. Before I knew it, it had crept to the top of my favorite movies. I've seen it about eight times because I keep recommending it to people and then sitting down and watching it with them, but I'm still not tired of it. In this movie, Max takes a bit of a backseat to an indomitable amputee and her companions, women from the harem of the local creepy old warlord. Furiosa is not the only powerful one either—none of these women are helpless or one-dimensional. Tom Hardy delivers a stoic yet truly impressive Max with something like 43 lines. The world is what I love most, though. George Miller creates several utterly unique, colorful, fully-formed cultures, and he doesn't waste the viewer's time with backstory—he assumes we're intelligent enough to figure out relevant details and the rest is up to our fully piqued imaginations. Though the action is non-stop, it never gets boring and drives the plot rather than distracting from it. Plus, bonus points for a lot of practical effects instead of relying mostly on CGI!In summary: powerful disabled female character, fantastic world, engaging action, my favorite."
" Babes and bonnets
",0.0,-0.9426,2017-05-16 00:00:00,3,"I was told that Mad Max: Fury Road has had excellent reviews although an early one that I saw gave it only two stars. I can see why. Its a vast empty road with a desert at its heart. When the end credits rolled the wacky names of characters hinted at a more enjoyable movie but, like The 300 and other heavily stylized action movies, I was just left with a headache. And the frenetic editing makes 'Crank II' look like The Bridges of Madison County.There's plenty to watch on screen and some sly nods to Star Wars, Dark Crystal (of all things) and The Cars That Ate Paris. But Mad Max barely emerges as a character (in this version he really does have mental health problems) and is hardly heroic. As for the rest of the cast, their appearance has to do much of the work of characterization as this is a film where punches, hackings and gun fire serve instead of dialogue. Explosions are the new social network.An early shot lines up pursuing cars as if they were entrants in that old cartoon series Wacky Races but there's nothing as fun as that here. The post apocalyptic desert world is well realized but even in the future Aborigines have been marginalized. I got the impression that White Australian audiences just don't want to have to look at them, or perhaps hope nuclear war will resolve any lingering problems from colonialism.Unbelievably (actually all too believably) a blogger has ranted that Mad Max: Fury Road is a leftist feminist plot on behalf of Hollywood. The blogger burbles ""This is the Trojan Horse feminists and Hollywood leftists will use to (vainly) insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things, including physique, strength, and logic. And this is the subterfuge they will use to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity, further ruining women for men, and men for women.""I can barely understand the reasoning here: women and men only exist for each other? Equality ruins men and women? But the fact is that Fury Road's depiction of women conforms to number of established types and rarely strays from soft porn imagery of virginal hotties, gun toting babes and nurturing mothers. The audience laughed at an amusing scene where Max looks up from the dusty desert floor to see a group of young scantly clad women hosing themselves down. It is all very knowing, but is knowing sexism any different from actual sexism? Anyway, the women are needed here because, like the female gladiators in Gladiator, they stop the whole film becoming madly homoerotic.The film is excellently designed drawing on top Brit pop cartoonist Brendan McCarthy who produced a brilliant run of covers for Shade: The Changing Man and the fably mad Rogan Ghosh a dimension spanning Hindu deity cum Jerry Cornelius figure who exuberantly captured sci- fi's new wave for the Nineties in a way the current craze for Steam Punk doesn't.The trouble is Fury Road is so highly stylized, so frenetic, it just left me cold .Frankly two stars seems just about right, but I'll give it three just to be generous."
" Wasted Wastland
",-0.4939,-0.9441,2017-05-16 00:00:00,1,"Truly one of one of the most overblown, overrated films of all time. While the casting of Tom Hardy is enticing, he spends nearly all of the first half of the film with a metal harness covering his face and the rest of his role is reduced down to grunting like a cave man. Max was never the loquacious type, but Gibson had a talent for displaying his character through looks and subtle movements. And most importantly he was just ""cool"", like Clint Eastwood as The Man with No Name. In fact, a lot of comparisons could be made between the Dollars trilogy and the Max films, until now. Actually, FR feels more like an awful spin-off where the character you really want to see is put to side, out of everyone's way so the filmmakers could make us watch who the film is really about(See Red Sonja). One could still get away with this, if the other film you were using him to build up were any good, but it's not. Oh God, it's not.It's strange to think the film's title is still Mad Max, almost like they have no confidence in their protagonist's appeal at all. Speaking of Furiosa (who happens to have a name derived from the film's title road), she's about as one-dimensional and uninteresting as the rest of the film. Fury Road really needed to pick a protagonist or at least let her and Max be foils for each other, so that we can get a little character development. There is NONE of that in Fury Road. The only memorable performance comes from Nicholas Hoult, who, strangely enough, seems to be the only one who understands what kind of movie he's in.And for all those defenders of this film saying that the other Max films were never his story either, let me quell that bulls**t know-nothing argument right now. They were his stories, because he was always an integral part of them. The only one that's not really about him is Beyond Thunderdome, which is/was regarded as the worst of the series, and that's mostly because a bunch of kids hijack the film half way through. The other characters needed him, and though he was always a reluctant hero, he always came through.Again, he didn't really need to be the focal point of this, but since he happens to go along for the entire runtime of this story, he should at least contribute something other than a random last minute change-of-heart. Otherwise, he's just taking up space, just like this film did in every dead brain cell the human head.Most of the ideas in this are style over substance. For example: lots of weird spiky cars blowing up, a woman with a robotic arm, a strange breast-milking facility, a giant safe to keep concubine slaves.They've compared this to The Road Warrior because supposedly both films are ""one long chase"". Apparently, nobody's seen The Road Warrior because while there are numerous chases in that film (done far better than FR's garbage effects by the way), the film is first and foremost a Western. The Lone Hero wanders into the weak but good-natured town and must reluctantly save them from various bandits and marauders lurking in the badlands. All the Mad Max films were Westerns where the old West was exchanged for a post-apocalyptic outback, and instead of horse rides and gunfights we were treated to high-octane car chases and makeshift guerrilla warfare. In short, it's not about how many cars you could crash, but how much you care about the memorable albeit simplistic characters of his very strange world.Anybody who says this film has anything praiseworthy at all(even nearly all the critics we respect) has no idea what their talking about. Either this is a truly strange case of bandwagon fever gone tragically awry or the whole world truly has gone mad."
" Was expecting more...
",0.0,0.9556,2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"Having not seen any of the previous Mad Max movies the beginning of this film certainly confuses, scares and freaks you out at first which I guess is what the directors were trying to achieve and achieve they did. However, after the first 10 minutes when you've seen all the scenes and characters you get used to it. The special effects were certainly good and the plot was an interesting though rather dramatic one. Again, having not seen any of the other series, my outlook on the movie may not be accurate but as a stand alone movie and having gotten so much buzz including an Oscar nomination I was expecting a 'WOW!' movie. Unfortunately, the acting of some of the main characters (mainly those 'breeder' girls) was very poor and dragged the movie a bit. Also the random love affair between Nux and the red haired girl was pretty cliché which spoiled the movies realism. There were some plot parts which just seemed to be added on for no proper reason but that may just be me having not been a part of the series. All in all a great movie with great themes and effects though some acting which could have been improved."
" Thrilling one of a kind action film
",0.7579,0.2342,2017-05-11 00:00:00,9,"Mad Max: Fury Road has been overly hyped throughout years since it's released in 2015. For the most part, the hype and overly success from the box office and critical acclaim is warranted. Within the film these are stories that comprise larger legends: avatars emerging from the mists of history now and again and changing everything. In Fury Road, he takes a minute to tell Furiosa his. This is not even mentioning Max, or that the allies Max, Furiosa, and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds. ""That,"" says Max, pointing at a naked woman suspended in an open enclosure up in the air, weeping for help, ""is bait."" He gets it. Women are not kittens stuck in trees. The overall action and stunts is what makes Fury Road a unique and one of a kind film. There isn't much though many long car chases.As a rewatch 08/06/17', Mad Max Fury Road remains one of the greater action films of this decade. This film feels better and more entertaining on a second watch. Truly one of the rare films in Hollywood today. It delivers on what it was meant to, and that is entertainment value, incredible stuns and visuals, and great performances by the leads."

" (Review of Black and Chrome Edition)
",0.0,0.9823,2017-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Let me begin by quoting Director George Miller commenting on this release: ""Losing some of the information of colour makes it somehow more iconic."" Nearly 2 years ago to the day, Mad Max: Fury Road exploded ferociously onto the big screen. It now stands as a modern pioneer of the immense success that large franchises can achieve by using practical effects over CGI wherever possible (over 80% of the film is shot in this way). Re-released now in monochrome, this version of Mad Max: Fury Road is just as thrilling to watch as it is in colour; if in radically diverse ways.Initial stipulations for Fury Road included making the film as colourful as possible. It is unusual, then, that Miller should be calling this desaturated edition ""the best version of the movie"". In fact, this is the style in which Miller always wanted to release Fury Road, and ultimately, it isn't hard to see why.The 2015 version is certainly a stylish film; winning Six Academy Awards including Best Production and Costume Design. But the blend between action and monochrome is remarkably tasteful here; it can be strongly argued that Fury Road is the ideal film for this sort of translation. The black and white itself is never flat; it's not just a simple case of putting a filter over the screen. Plenty of extra contrast is added to the image which enriches the movie nicely, creating a chilling atmosphere at points. Although unfortunately, in black and white it loses a lot of the emphatic impact of the flaming guitars, and the incredible stunt work isn't quite as staggering. For a film based primarily on its visual effects, this does take its toll on the overall product. In contrast however, the outstanding performances by the cast are wonderfully enhanced, hurling the audience back to the golden age of cinema; where movies were dependent on the principle cast's integrity to be an effective movie, not special effects. In the moments where Fury Road isn't putting the Fast and Furious franchise to shame with its exceptionally filmed car chases through the Australian wastelands, the personal moments are somehow even more forceful than in the original. Miller is indeed right about the absence of colour making a film feel strangely more distinctive, and Fury Road benefits enormously from this added layer.It was announced recently that James Mangold's gritty, dystopian superhero masterpiece, Logan, will be re-released in monochrome. Thus, it seems cinema's adoration of black and white is sliding back into popular culture again, and by God let it endure. The possibilities for future iconic re-releases of movies in black and white are limitless, and as it does for the use of practical effects in modern times, Mad Max: Fury Road proudly stands as an embodiment of the great achievements that big budget films can accomplish if released in monochrome.What A Lovely Way (pun intended) to watch this adrenaline-fuelled spectacle."

Make one with no plot, with several absolutely out of place looking models, with endless rushing and racing, with endless violence and with endless explosions. Add blood, add silly costumes, add ugly freaks galore, add oil spills, add sand and add unwanted and unsuitable sexy innuendos. This is what you get - awful Mad Max, which leaves a profound shock of wasted time and a feeling of being had by. Even beautiful models like Kershaw or Whiley or Kravitz, even fine actresses like Theron could not save this monstrosity from being a whole, complete, total, wholesome flop on all sides. This is an example of a horrible, totally ugly and unpardonably silly failure which made some cash and was praised. I do not dig this sick liking of sick films. I do not recommend this awful idiocy to anybody"

You would think after all this time the same director would opt for a reboot to the franchise - with something more intelligent, gripping etc... I don't know what I saw other than a never ending car chase, barely any dialog or plot development, and 'weird' things just thrown in there as if the writer/director or anyone who was part of production was totally stoned/high. Seriously a flame throwing guitar? you would think in a place where water and fuel was scarce there would be massive conservation efforts. Not a drumming vehicle or a a driving guitar thing. Luckily i saw this on Netflix as i would never forgive myself if I actually paid to see this movie in an actual theater. This movie as well as the former - should have never been made. It should have ended with the 1981 film and that's it. The 8.1 rating on IMDb also has me doubting IMDb itself as this movie I don't see how 8/10 is possible unless its a negative number. Obviously the system is rigged as this was truly a awful and preposterous movie. Even the post-apocalyptic movie ""the postman"" was better (had a story, plot) and more realistic than this trash.

In the beginning, the opening scene often can seems to be out of place and throughout the movie you start to realize its meaning. However unlike other movies, Mad Max never came to that realization. For 1 hour and 55 minutes I lived in the false expectation that the movie would turn and the guys would stop driving their cars in a Coachella-like environment. When only five minutes of the movie was left I understood the mistake I had make by not pausing the movie when I first sensed something was odd. Do not loose time and temper by making the same mistake as I did."

All those movies have intense action at that time but when we see them now we are not satisfied due to the current special effects used in movies and we grow by seeing them. But this Mad Max:Fury Road is the complete action package for all action lovers. It reminds me the Mad Max 2nd part actually where the chasing scenes and trucks/vehicles used in the film are nearly same. this movie has a story just for a name sake and it is completely filled with mind blowing action sequence from start to finish. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron has given their best performance. If you like action movie and if you are missing this movie, then there is no point that you are action movie fan.

I had heard fellow reviewers claim this movie was sterling, but I figured that I had to try it for myself. Watching all of the previous movies I already had an insight on what the director looked for in the movie. But this new adaptation gave the series a bigger sense of accomplishment and a bigger sense of plot overall. I did miss out on a lot of key plot scenes to give the movie a smoother flow but it was compensated by amazing costumes and an overall powerful acting. I do recommend people to watch this movie and have high expectations of it. Truly deserving of the Oscars it won.

" A one hundred and twenty minute adrenaline shot
",0.0,-0.9911,2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"A one hundred and twenty minute adrenaline shot; absolute carnage in the desert and all shot with awesome grungy, violent and most importantly, physical, action.Immortan Joe, a tyrant of a blasted and wasted desert after Earth suffers a nuclear apocalypse, controls all supply of water for his downtrodden citizens. He also holds sway over his Five Wives, imprisoned in his citadel. But when one of his subordinates attempts to rescue these women, he is led on a gasoline fueled chase across the open desert, while amongst all of this, a traumatised loner named Max gets pulled into the fray.Back in 1983, Australian director George Miller redefined the action genre with his sequel ""The Road Warrior"" to the 1979 Mad Max, a film with so much vehicular chaos and destruction it was praised for its physical stunt work and world building. Now in 2015 we get Miller returning for a reboot/re-envisioning of the same story. But fear not, this is Miller's baby, and it is in good hands. Fury Road is exactly the film it should be. Like 2012's Dredd, it is a one trick pony but the ace up its sleeve is undeniably astounding. Capturing the pre-computer generated age of the 80s and 90s, the film is a visceral and eye-popping spectacle of carnage of the highest caliber, made even more so by the current over-saturation of action films.Tom Hardy takes on the titular role as Max, a man haunted by the death of his family (shown exclusively through jarring, nightmarish flashbacks) beside him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, the warrior woman with a bionic arm who defies a tyrant to free his slave wives. Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the part of the villain Toecutter in Miller's 1979 Mad Max. All of the acting, asides perhaps the anger-fueled Immortan, is downplayed but not forgotten here. The film shows rather than tells with Hardy barely speaking at all outside of an opening narration, Theron's Furiosa very well steals the show as the character with the most to lose. A worthy note should be given to Nicolas Hoult (X-Men Days of Future Past) who disappears into the role of one of Immortan Joe's pasty pale War Boys. People argue that there's a lack of ""characterisation"" here, when in fact there is plenty to progress the story and make you understand their motives. What this film lacks is unnecessary quips, one-liners and exposition dumps, all which can bog a film down.But the action takes centre stage here, and the budget delivered towards the vehicle, costume and character design and construction. Near everything is practical effects, you cannot watch it and not appreciate how everything looks, my eyes were on stalks just taking everything in.I actually can't think of anything ""wrong"" with it. It is a grisly film, a visceral film with such an astounding visual style that has been long forgotten about.There's a truck in this film covered in massive drums, amps, and on top a blindfolded dude suspended in bungee chords with a double- necked guitar that shoots flames! How how can you NOT like that??"

The violence is well done and realistic if you're into that, but the world created in this film doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. All of the vehicles run perpetually, they never need refueling. The villains seem to have a lot of advanced technology yet live like beasts. The land is said to be poisoned and barren, so how have the old ladies we encounter been surviving all these years? I guess they don't need to eat, kind of like the vehicles never need a fill up. The war rig's tires are shredded and then later they are fine. Max seems to have an unlimited supply of blood. Max says that if they bring as much extra gas as they can carry on a motorcycle, they should be able to run for 160 days! Really? I know motorcycles get good mileage, but come on! Again, is this a primitive post war apocalyptic world, or do they have advanced, high mileage technology? It's all over the map. There are many more examples of such silliness. But most annoying of all is the relentless feminist subplot that is continually rammed down the viewers throat. The high rating of this film baffles some reviewers, but that where we are in this country. This is what sells."

The shortage has changed it is now water that everybody seeks after, but why would you not flee with a enough water. no instead they flee the rock city with nothing to seek out a mystical environment. only to find it poisoned beyond repair. But somehow there are about 5 old lady's who have survived without water, food or any other supplies and they drive back to a place they were running from.

Make films where women are somehow physically more powerful than men if you want, by why do it with a film called Mad Max? And as for the story, well, like most action films nowadays, it leaves me cold. Back in the 80s/90s, good actions films were stories with action thrown in.

Intentionally laughable villains. But, because the movie understood what it was and did not try to be anything else, it was humorous and an enjoyable 96 minutes.Mad Max: Road Fury, is essentially a Frogtown remake, but with all the common sense decisions of Frogtown left out. The movie is one giant action scene, loaded with expensive and pointless special effects whose sole purpose is to distract the audience from the complete lack of plot. Hollow characters without any personality and almost no dialog. Unlike Frogtown, the villains here are unintentionally laughable.

" ""Oh What a day, What a lovely day""
",0.5859,0.9984,2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Mad Max Fury Road was my most anticipated movie this year. The Mad Max franchise has always been best known for its atmosphere and car battles. Mel Gibson made the first movies classics and made the role iconic (We don't talk about Beyond Thunderdome). So Tom Hardy has pretty big shoes to fill with Fury Road. This film is one of the anticipated movies this year and did it live up to expectations, oh yeah it did.Mad Max follows our hero Max Rockatansky who is captured by an army of men called war boys who torture him. The war boys leader The Immortan Joe is in control of the biggest water supply in the wasteland. He also has a many wives, who with his ""help"" produce more war boys for his army and mother's milk. But he is betrayed by one of his war rig drivers Furiosa who steals some of his wives and makes of for the promise land and eventually meet up with Max. They decide to work together in order to reach this land of green. The film's story is amazing and is easily the best in the franchise with twist and turns and many different moments that are iconic make this the best story out of all of the films. The story is also propelled by great performances from Tom Hardy who plays the Mad Road Warrior and Furiosa who is played by Charlize Theron. They both bring great life and emotion into the characters which is hard to do in such a chaotic move. They are also supported by a great supporting cast. Immortan Joe might be the best Mad Max villain yet with his menacing voice and skull mouth. The star of this show is the action scenes and boy are they amazing. When the trailer was revealed most people thought they used way too much CGI but, as time went out we found out that 80% of the film was practical effects with CGI being used for the Furisoa's arm and the sandstorm. Yep real stunts, REAL explosion. These stunts are the most insane stunts I have ever seen in a movie and definitely help this movie have some of my favorite action scenes ever. My number one worry I had about this film was if it would feel like a Mad Max movie. This movie feels like a Mad Max movie just as much Road Warrior was. It has the perfect blend of crazy and action and puts them perfectly into the best action movie in the past decade. I am not kidding when I say this. Mad Max Fury Road is not only a amazing movie worthy of the franchise,it is the best movie this year and is one of the best action movies in history. This movie has everything everyone wanted, a great story,great main characters and amazing action scenes and the score is one of the coolest scores ever in a movie. This movie truly is a masterpiece and when you are done watching it you will truly feel that you say an action movie like no other. +Amazing action scenes +Great story +Fantastic +atmosphere +Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron 9.5/10 Masterpiece."

Although the action starts right away, it took a while for the film to pull me in. It isn't mindless action, but sometimes it was hard to tell what was happening. It felt like it took a while for the story to formulate. It is frenetic but not in the familiar shaky camera kind of way. The effective dramatic scenes gives it a right amount of balance in the proceedings without being cheesy. By the end, I was intrigued by the whole thing.

I've never seen a movie that has so greatly balanced the cliché of damsels in distress (while not making it cliché in a way) and also evening it out with a story where women rise from actual oppression. I think this is for any audience type and can be looked at in any view whether it be a feminist perspective of ""the rise against the patriarchy"" or just another save the society from this dystopian nightmare. I went into this absolutely hating the style, the stupid guitar guy and drum people, the whole world's look, character's actions, and the slower start introducing Max and all, but I ended up really admiring it. This movie also does a survival story (@gravity) in the middle of nowhere and doesn't ruin anything when it has not that much dialogue. With barely any talking between the group, you sense the bond the have with all their actions, facial expressions, and etc. It's great movie even though I still have problems with the lack of some dialogue and all the flashbacks, the villain who wasn't even powerful (maybe that's the point ey), and society but either way it's a stunning movie."

",-0.3875,0.7039,2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"How many of these apocalyptic trash non-epics are we expected to watch? There's nothing new to this story. I had to pause it halfway through to watch something more interesting. Came back to it the next day and still was disappointed. Quasi-emotional scenes are dragged out too long with the over-the-top score reminiscent of a reality-TV drama-fest. Seriously, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, Zoe, Rosie, Riley et al are capable of so much more. Maybe they were bored or broke and had to take on this. Either way, their talents are wasted. Some of the characters and their on screen personas are downright silly. Like the guitar player standing up in front of some bombastic vehicle cranking out atmospheric riffs while the vehicle bobs, bounces and weaves across the desert landscape. And where are they getting the gunpowder and seemingly unending supply of gasoline in the middle of the desert? I understand the suspension of belief but come on! The line has to be drawn somewhere. If you want to see intensity and a story that makes sense, watch the original Mad Max and then The Road Warrior. At least those are believable and certainly more entertaining."
" To be honest, one is reluctant to enjoy this film
",0.6705,-0.974,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"""Who was more insane? Me, or every other person?"" In ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Miller has pushed his Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone distraught to its sensible extraordinary. Never again are the general population of Max Rockatansky's reality just scroungers for oil or power; they have been changed into animals of condition, either left with one characterising need or left with no similarity of reason. ""Fury Road"" is a fierce film, yet the rough demonstrations in this world don't feel like subjective activity beats—they rise up out of an entire absence of different alternatives or a firm feeling of straight-up madness. Mill operator's new vision of Max isn't a warrior. Or maybe, he's a man driven by the recollections of past sins to do minimal more than survive. He strolls with the phantoms of those he couldn't spare, and his voyaging allies have pushed him to the edge of rational soundness. While meandering at this edge, Max is abducted and changed into a strict blood sack for a non domesticated warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who serves the impulses of his twisted ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who additionally played the reprobate Toecutter in the first ""Mad Max""). From the begin, Miller gives you no opportunity to ""straightforwardness"" into this world or the story he needs to tell. The edge rate is quickened, the altering is hyperactive, the awful person talks through a veil that makes a large portion of his exchange garbled (shades of Hardy's Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises""), and the terrible dreams of Miller's turned future come quick and incensed. Immortan Joe is a scarcely alive irregularity of nature, continued breathing by tubes associated with his face and served by correspondingly distorted half-people with complete names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) and The People Eater (John Howard). One of Joe's most striking warriors is an effective lady known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is driving an escort from Immortan Joe's fortification to the oil refinery Gastown when she digresses off kilter. Things being what they are Furiosa has captured Joe's ""reproducers,"" the ladies he keeps detainee with an end goal to make a male beneficiary. She's taking them to ""the green place,"" to well-being. Obviously, Joe sends his men after Furiosa—including Nux, to whom Max is still appended— and whatever is left of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" comprises of one since quite a while ago supported pursue over the unforgiving desert. Except for one centrepiece of discourse, the film happens altogether moving, speeding, pursuing, ricocheting, and detonating over Miller's seared scene. As an impression of more edgy circumstances, Miller has redesigned the necessities of his future world from wares like oil to immaculate survival. Max has been rethought as a battling, driving machine, a man who ""discovers his own specific manner,"" pushing ahead trying to surpass his apparitions. Nux is a mentally conditioned goon, a man-animal who trusts that he will pass on and be renewed subsequent to relinquishing himself for an excursion to Valhalla. Max in the long run ventures into the part of the activity legend, at the same time, in one of his most brave moves, Miller gives the heaviness of the story to Furiosa, a lady who clutches the main thing that could give her trust in this vicious world—the people to come. Theron does apparently the best work of her vocation here, cunningly passing on the drive in Furiosa's spirit in a way that powers the whole film. She accomplishes more with a singing gaze or held jaw than most performers could with a page of discourse. Furthermore, one shouldn't underestimate the strengthening message at the heart of this film—Eve Ensler, creator of ""The Vagina Monologues"" counselled with Miller on the script—which proposes that ladies, as the makers of new life, will, intrinsically, dependably be the sexual orientation that holds hardest onto seek after what's to come. Furiosa takes a gander at the craziness of the male initiative around her and chooses that's the last straw. When one of Furiosa's wards starts giving birth and still safeguards herself and her yet-to-be-conceived youngster (subsequent to being shot no less), it's hard not to see ""Fury Road"" as a response to the macho jabber that so frequently characterises the activity class. ""FURY ROAD"" is the most amazing activity stunt you've found in years, you truly require just hold up a couple of minutes to see something better. This is a film where you continue imagining that its achieved its zenith and afterwards, mysteriously, that minute is abandoned in the tidy. Fury Road"" was destined to be sufficiently noteworthy as an unadulterated specialised achievement—a film that chuckles despite blockbuster CGI bashes with a portion of the best altering and sound plan the class has ever observed—but then Miller goes after an option that is more prominent than specialised ability. He holds high up the activity layout that he made with ""The Road Warrior"" and contends that Hollywood shouldn't have been replicating it for as long as three decades, they ought to have been expanding on it. ""Fury Road"" was a test to an entire era of activity producers, asking them to take after its nervy way into the class' future and, similar to Miller, attempt their hardest to make something new."
" what a film! what a lovely film!
",0.658,0.9096,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"...well, maybe the word ""lovely"" isn't the BEST way to describe it, although the visuals are quite beautiful.I'd say that the best words to describe ""Fury Road"" are awesome, intense, chaotic, and jaw- dropping. It is one of the greatest action-adventure movies I have ever seen. Not only is the action well shot and executed, but the entire visual style has an epic quality to it. Everything from the character designs to the color pallet work together to form a masterful cinematic roller coaster ride. This brutal and monumental instant classic also contains likable characters, strong performances, and subtle storytelling. As George Lucas once (ironically) said ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is full of mind blowing special effects, and also contains a pretty outstanding story. there are moments of genuine power and tenderness. At times Miller puts the action on pause, and the spotlight is now on the characters. So, despite this film containing seemingly non stop action, it still is strong enough script and character wise to keep the audience caring and engaged. I would also like to note that I very much admired how Max's backstory is mostly kept a mystery here (perhaps it is explained in the original films, which I have yet to see-although I do plan to sometime soon). Instead, it is made clear that something has happened to him- there has been some tragedy in his past life, and it effects his character. It shows some kind of human weakness, almost like the final scenes of ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"". Warren Beatty's character always seems like the toughest guy in town, but by the end the pathetic nature of human beings is shown, and his weaker side is at last exposed."

(ad nauseam)You know, just like 80-year-old director Ridley Scott (and his Alien movies) - I believe that 72-year-old director George Miller (and his Mad Max movies) is becoming more & more senile (and, yes, cynical) as his movie plot-lines regress more & more into one of the bleakest states of pure cinematic tunnel-vision that you could ever imagine possible.I mean - Here we are again (ho-hum) taking yet another look at man's future - And, guess what? - Yep - That's right! - It stinks.And, above all else - What I'd like to know is this - Where the hell in all of this utter wasteland were all of these fantastic vehicles and precision weapons being manufactured, anyway? Eh? Where? 'Cause in this $150 million production where cruelty, torture, and deformity ruled - There was certainly no evidence, whatsoever, of there being anyone bright enough to even have the capability of putting together such amazing vehicles and weapons as these.

It lacks any meaningful story line. The beginning of the film barely sets up any kind of plot, nor does it properly introduce the characters involved. For the first 20 mins, I wondered what the hell was going on.You get the gist shortly afterwards, however all you get is more of the same and the same and the same for the whole film.I really like the post apocalyptic genre, as the Directors have so much scope to be creative with back stories. However, this film has next to no back story at all. There are a few cool details to the post apocalyptic World that have been thought up and are to be admired, however it doesn't make up for the total lack of a meaningful plot.Instead, you are 'treated' to an hour and a half of special effects, stunts and craziness which all gets very repetitive.Personally I sat through all of it waiting for the film to show me more than just action scene after action scene. Something a bit more meaningful and interesting. It never comes.You'll know if you are going to like this film after 20 minutes. If you do, then great; keep watching. If not, don't stick around expecting anything else. You'll be bitterly disappointed."
" Pile of dog poop
",0.0,-0.9714,2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Mad Max and Road Warrior were great movies. Mad Max Fury Road is a pile of dog excrement. In addition to what the other reviewers who hated it said, it relied too heavily on CGI, had a scattered, poorly written ... dare I call it a ""plot""? because it really wasn't -- and we had no reason to care about ANY of these characters. It was a mess from the moment it started until it thankfully ended. If this had been the original Mad Max, no one in Hollywood would have EVER made a single sequel of this horrific mess. Sad that this is what passes for a ""good"" movie these days."
" Best Film of 2015

We were in the same high school TV and Video Production class and we both love film, but he's a radical film fan. So when he came to school and told me ""Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film I've ever had the privilege to watch in theaters."" I replied, ""Chill out dude I'm sure it's good but it's not that good."" He kept on hyping it for me so when I eventually did see it, it was not even close to what I was expecting. It took me three viewings of Mad Max: Fury Road for me to realize it was a great film. I have now come to the conclusion, that although Spotlight was a GREAT movie, Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film of 2015. There has never been a director I've watched in my life that took more risks with the camera than George Miller in this movie. He directs the crap out of this movie. It is one of the best directed films I've ever seen, and my film watching career includes over 500 movies. The acting is first rate and spectacular, however the visuals and absolutely fantastic imagery overtake the great performances across the board which further proves my point that it is a fantastically directed movie. I can't find a single flaw with this film. If it had won best picture I would have been one happy camper. It is a GREAT movie, and I will be upset if it does not make this years AFI top 100. You are doing yourself a major disservice if you do not see this movie, it is beyond what I would call a great film. Mad Max: Fury Road is the Best action film, nay the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years. WATCH IT NOW, BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND."
" Is it really an existential or feminist myth?
",0.0,-0.9468,2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"I just want to know if this movie was influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's EL TOPO. Desert settings (in Jodorowsky's case, Mexico), apocalyptic themes, arty cinematography and even the use of actors who are missing limbs, have other disabilities, possibly blindness, etc. See also HOLY MOUNTAIN and his long-sought version of DUNE. Jodorowsky was interested in Aleister Crowley. I am not going to summarize Mad Max. Watch EL TOPO and then go back to Mad Max. I did find Mad Max rather longish. It also predicts the super-literal Monster Trucks movie, now in theatres. Some people find the trucks the most imaginative thing in Mad Max."
" Don't believe the hype
",0.0,-0.765,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Blinded by action sequences and explosions, Mad Max: Fury Road lacks depth and emotion leaving the audience confused if they want more, or if they care at all. To simply summarize the plot: drive away, stop, drive back. After you finish the 2 hour flick you wonder if anything was even accomplished and leaves the viewer feeling empty after the stunt-induced high and raised adrenaline from one of many 10-15 minute high speed action sequences. Any acting, or lack there of, is intended to be ignored by the viewer in hopes to avoid the lackluster and unintelligent dialogue written by an action movie director. Could be the most overrated movie that won 6 Oscars, in my opinion."
" Who CHANGED the World? Miller did.
",0.0,0.9274,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"As fast, exhilarating, over the top and relentless as possible, Mad Max Fury Road is exactly the film that we want and that it needs to be. Visionary George Miller shows us that a two hour chase film can simultaneously be a jaw-dropping work of cinematic art in every visual and technical aspect as well as surprisingly deep and metaphoric story.Thirty years after the end of the iconic trilogy, Miller revisits the iconic dystopian world he created and inevitably defined the late 1970's and 80's, boasting a new cast and making use of the best modern technology in the way of practical effects and filming techniques demoting digital effects to bare minimum. Despite being a Mad Max- character centered franchise, Theron's Furiosa gets equal if not more prominence than Hardy's charismatic Rockatansky in a film that raises feminist issues left and right despite its high octane macho cover. Miller does this with such effortless insight and balance that we never feel any kind of unnecessary or forced agenda being rubbed in your faces.Fury Road might certainly not be a film for everyone but its instant classic and landmark appeal is undeniable. Gorgeously shot, impeccably acted and frenetically edited and scored (Brothers In Arms by Tom Holkenborg is one of the best cues in recent memory) Fury Road is an exemplary piece of filmmaking to remember for all the good reasons."

Let us examine the eight-cylinder engine is now on the cogs and nuts.Pilot: the protagonist is quite typical, but very memorable and devoid of distracting roughness. We face a brutal male knight without fear and without reproach, the valiant and noble specimen so ignoble environment fauna. Tom Hardy, may not be the ideal candidate for the role of Mad Max, but after watching the film, we are ready to take him for a forgotten hero of roads. The protagonist: 8 out of 10.Passengers: minor characters contrast and memorable. Study of characters pleases, each character has its own unique style, originality, and their fury.
