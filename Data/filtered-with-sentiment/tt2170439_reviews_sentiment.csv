" As funny as the first...
",0.4404,0.9948,2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,"""Horrible Bosses 2"" is a Comedy - Crime movie and the sequel of ""Horrible Bosses"", in which we watch the three friends starting their own business but everything does not go as they planned. They have to change their tactics and their plan in general in order not to bankrupt.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what I was about to watch and I was not disappointed by it. The sequel was good and it followed the pattern of the first movie, it had a simple but interesting plot combined with many simply hilarious moments. The direction which was made by Sean Anders, it was good and I liked the way he presented for one more time the main characters, their goals and also their dreams. Regarding the interpretations of Jason Bateman who played as Nick Hendricks, Charlie Day who played as Dale Arbus and Jason Sudeikis who played as Kurt Buckman, I believe they were all very good. Finally, I have to say that ""Horrible Bosses 2"" is a nice and funny movie that will make you laugh and I am sure that you will have a great time watching it."
" An entertaining sequel!
",0.4926,0.8189,2021-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Since you're reading Horrible Bosses 2 reviews I might assume you have already watched the 1st pt. And you should proceed. I, personally, couldn't wait another day to watch this part. The movie sequel is on point with its first original chapter. It might get overly complicated or incohesive sometimes, but generally it's easy to comprehend and simply amusing to watch!!!"
" Just as good as the first
",0.4404,0.988,2021-02-07 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first film. It was perfectly decent and entertained me, and I thought the sequel held its own and entertained me just as much.This was mostly due to the inclusion of Chris Pine, who nailed his role and delivered some of the funnier comedy moments. I also thought that Jennifer Aniston's character was funnier in this film.On top of this, I also thought that the plot was just a bit tighter and more well refined than the first film. Still not amazing but perfectly fine and good fun.The main three characters were solid, with expectedly great performances. A lot of the same old jokes and tropes were rehashed from the first film, but there was enough new stuff to keep my interest.Not amazing, not awful. If you liked the first you'll like the follow up."
" Good but not great
",-0.5409,0.3697,2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,This movie is like good for the morning movies I watch this is the kinda movies I watch in the morning but it is not better than the original one.
" Funny but irritating
",-0.4678,0.296,2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Packed with pretty good jokes, but someone thought they should beef it up with hysterical high pitch idiotic babbling. Would have liked it a lot without this."
" Dreadful.
",-0.4404,-0.7773,2021-01-09 00:00:00,4,"The first one was okay 6/10 at best, but this one was absolutely awful. Nothing more to say. Dire."
" Hard to watch and not worth your time
",-0.2654,-0.8396,2020-11-11 00:00:00,2,"The 3 lead characters seem to have gotten significantly more stupid than they were in the first movie, over the top painfully unbelievably stupid. The writers have just rehashed the jokes from the 1st movie."
" Really bad
",-0.5849,0.7269,2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"For a ****ty comedy sequel. What is there to laugh at, don't get it"
" Probably worst sequel ever
",-0.6249,-0.896,2020-09-30 00:00:00,2,"To start of Horrible bosses 1 was epic and funny as hell. But when analyzing why it was funny it was mostly due to the antagonists ""the bosses"". The second installment misses that and 25 minutes into the movie I was still waiting for an original joke. Timing is totally off and the past of the movie is so annoyingly slow, the jokes so lame that the whole experience becomes a horror instead of a comedy.Do your self a favor stick to the original and treasure those moments. Dont let Horrible bosses 2 ruin it!"
" Good but not amazing like its prequel
",-0.7025,-0.4984,2020-09-06 00:00:00,6,"It was little bit funny. But it was not as awesome like its first part. Jamie Fox brought some laughter. Cross talking of the main actors was quite irritating. If anyone of them was cracking a good joke, I wasn't able to enjoy it because of the cross talking by the other two actors. You have to use the script and the dialogues wisely, otherwise all the efforts go in vain."
" A lot better than I expected it to be
",0.4404,0.9945,2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,"With an eager and hilarious returning cast, and plenty of fantastic new faces on screen, Horrible Bosses 2 never tries to hard to live up to the first film and proves to be one of the more amusing sequels I have seen in quite some time. The film is never boring, it feels entertaining through and through. Rather than rely on cheap gimmicks and make the film for simply the case of money, Horrible Bosses 2 feels like a genuine comedy and delightful return of our lead characters from the first film. The film is quite funny, and it never feels like it is forcing jokes upon the audience like so many other sequels and comedy films do today- which is refreshing, and provides for an easy viewing experience. There isn't anything too great about this film, it can feel rather average at times, with montages and plan set ups, and the situations that unfold. You can feel the tension rising on the screen, and you now when something bad is about to happen, which can be a bit annoying- but for the most part, the film does a good job for what it is. I enjoyed the return of the trio from the first flick, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie day- as well as the return of Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx's characters respectively. The true standout of this film, however, is Chris Pine who brings something to the table he hasn't done before and does a terrific job being one of the foes throughout the picture. I also enjoyed Christoph Waltz's performance as always, but he didn't seem to have a lot to work with, so if you were hoping to see a whole lot of him on screen, I suggest his other films. In the end, Horrible Bosses 2 was a delightful surprise. It's flawed, but a very worthy and decent sequel to one of my personal favorite comedies- and I wouldn't mind seeing these guys on the big screen again sometime soon.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
" Completely nuts!
",-0.4376,0.2011,2020-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Zapping the cable the other day, I stumbled upon this flick over 10 minutes past in (when they are trying to pick the door).I never watch comedies or the like, but I own up I couldn't stop laughing from the very beginning. Had to view and finish!Much recommended!"
" Laugh out loud funny slapstick for the modern era!
",0.7777,0.8596,2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Horrible bosses was a riot and this sequel is pretty much as good.The boys are back, but trying to be their own bosses, very badly! The plot is outrageous and largely mad! The laughs are big and largely mad! The cast are all brilliant and mostly mad! It's all mad, but it works!It's slap stick comedy but updated for the modern audience. Most of the gags are toilet humour level and the plot is pretty unrealistic if I am honest, but it just doesn't matter.Horrible bosses 2 entertains and is hillariously funny!Does anyone else think that Jennifer Anniston seems to enjoy playing a sex addict a little too much? She is just brilliant in the role!8/10"
" Enough to laugh
",0.5574,0.8519,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,Leave your head alone and watch just to laugh. I love comedies that develop around such a concept.
" Horrible Bosses 2
",-0.5423,0.4939,2020-05-27 00:00:00,6,"Despite its use of the same formula and gimmicks as the first film, its overall unnecessary attribute, losing some of its freshness and a lot of its black comedy energy, and maintaining some of same flaws, Horrible Bosses 2 is still a wild, fun, crazy, thrilling, and entertaining comedy, with a lot to offer in its insanity."
" Hilarious, was laughing out loud the whole time
",0.7096,0.7574,2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"I've understood that if you want you enjoy mad comedy movies, never go for stupid 'so called' good critics. Those dumb critics might give good review for serious movies. But they never do justice with fun comedy movies which you actually enjoy. This was so hilarious, couldn't help myself laughing throughout the whole movie. The first one was good but this is much better. And you need to see first one to enjoy this sequel. Funnier and crazier than the first part, it doesn't get you bored even for a second. And those dumb Rotten Tomatoes guys gave such bad reviews. So guys turn a blind eye to all the dumb so called good critics and just go and enjoy this mad roller coaster ride!!!"
" Hollywood at its worst
",-0.6249,-0.8807,2020-04-29 00:00:00,2,"The original was bad but the sequel well and truly scrapes the barrel. The bizarrely convoluted plot makes it hard to stay focused and the jokes are repetitive and boring. Charlie Day is the worst thing about the first movie and he is even worse here. How many aspiring actors must be dying inside when they see this guy in such a high profile role? Chris Pine, Jamie Foxx, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Spacey... all of these guys should hang their heads in shame for being associated with this debacle."
" Charlie Day is annoying...
",0.0,0.8855,2020-04-12 00:00:00,6,"...but I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I did laugh several times in watching this movie. I find comedies enjoyable but even with good ones I rarely laugh out loud. So thumbs up to this movie for managing to do that.That said, the constant cross-talk between the three main characters was almost as annoying as Charlie Day speaking (screeching) just on his own."
" Well...there are Bosses...Get it? :)
",0.4588,0.9168,2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Lightning strikes twice with another funny, engaging and delightful piece of crime comedy where they inept just about keep their chin above the trip wire.Just once I'd like to see a high concept comedy where the characters don't do something similar to the first one. So if the first movie is about hiding bigfoot the sequel is about the characters trying to run a successful ostrich farm. For example.My point being that you might think it would be hard to believe that these guys really did try to pull off a crime *again* but they do actually plot this very intelligently. By which I mean I didn't notice any glaring illogicalies, they even have a character's stupidity negate an easy way out more than once.They began this in a logical place considering the ending of the first movie and developed that idea in such a way that you really want to route for them to do with they plan on doing in this movie. The plot twists and turns without being predictable and you never feel like challenging character motivation.I don't quite remember two of these three characters being quite so stupid last time. But it's not really about them, it's the story we want and this one really delivers.It's one of the few movies that comments on our hyperbolic attitude to the issue of child sexuality and it nicely reminds us of issues of the economic system we live in.This is a movie that never settles for easy answers or solutions. Too often in movies I find myself wondering ""how will they get away with this!?"". And then they don't. Which is so lazy on the writers part. But I don't want to see the plan go off without a hitch either. With all the formulaic police procedurals on TV glamour zing law enforcement, this was a breath of fresh air.One big issue I had though: I don't want to spoil anything but there sort of isn't enough karmic retribution on our rapist character. Yes she is a rapist, or an attempted on at least. It's easpecially annoying considering how earlier in the move they moralize about sexual harassment.But still as good or better as the first."
" The odd funny moment
",0.1531,0.9716,2020-03-29 00:00:00,5,"There was the odd funny moment but all in all not as good as the first. If I could describe this film in one word it would be noisy. Charlie Day is the biggest culprit. He just shrieks and yells throughout the entire movie, that is his comedy style it seems. It just all felt a bit pointless and childish to me. Genuinely, I like movies like the Hangover and Bridesmaids but this is not in their league. It felt like three mates being told, here is a camera, just make it up as you go along and be as stupid as you want. Am a Bateman fan so not got any gripe against him or anyone else, just a very average film. Aniston is game as always, Foxx likewise. My wife normally likes this kind of stuff but even she said it was utter utter utter s#*%e. It gets five because it made me laugh a few times, it was non offensive and the cast seems like they gave it their all and had loads of fun. Am being kind to be honest."
" Just terrible
",-0.4767,0.9503,2020-03-24 00:00:00,2,"Normally i dont review bad comedies but this one is my god.. awful.
The humor isnt funny at all.. its annoying. If you opted for sarcasm humor you just have to have a good jokes and actors, like House md had. Comedy is in this film is childish at best.Its like fielding a team of all great attackers in football game(soccer) and hoping for the best. Or A-list actors on terrible script.Havent watched many of Friends episodes but whatever reputation Jennifer had, this movie kinda ruined it for me. Charlie was 10 times funnier in Its always sunny.."
" Ok
",0.296,0.3742,2020-03-22 00:00:00,5,Entertaining and great to pass the time. Funny but not hilarious.
" I laughed at the outtakes...
",0.4588,0.705,2020-03-08 00:00:00,5,"It was about half an hour before i laughed. Maybe I should've rewatched the first one beforehand as i couldn't remember the back stories. It was ok but like others have said, it was an unnecessary sequel."
" Unbelievably annoying
",-0.4576,0.8526,2019-12-21 00:00:00,1,"This is propably the first movie ever that I couldn't watch till the end. The beginning/introduction was fine and even sparked my interest for a little while but after that, it became clear to me that two of the main characters were made into total idiots. A little stupidity in a comedy movie is okay but this went way, way too far.All of the film's humour is centered around the two guys making ignorant mistakes, shouting loudly for no reason and not listening to each other. It becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on. I usually enjoy raunchy series and films but when the *entire* plot and all of the jokes are based on sheer idiocy, that is just too much.I guess this is one of those movies that you either love or absolutely hate, and for me it was definitely the latter."
" WORST MOVIE DO NOT WATCH
",-0.6249,-0.9693,2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,Its all BABBLING and more annoying ass crap babbling!!! Storyline is super lame. You know whats coming next. Dont even need spoilers. Same old same old. Should name this movie Horrible Idiots Yappers!!Its not even funny. Its the most annoying stupidest movie you ever watch.
" Better than first sequel
",0.4404,0.6705,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,It was actually funny but the story was the same I wish they had different stories
" My opinion
",0.0,-0.7841,2019-11-22 00:00:00,3,Unfortunately this part was very boring and there is no comedy .. I wasted two hours of my life
" Horrible Bosses 2: Even Horribler
",-0.5423,0.7477,2019-10-09 00:00:00,5,"The Horrible Bosses crew is at it again! Did you like the first Horrible Bosses? Great! They recycled a large portion of it for the sequel. It's still fun, it just lacks the same originality or spark the original had.If you haven't seen a Horrible Bosses movie, definitely see the original first. Don't get me wrong, Chris Pine adds some fun to this one and, after everything that's come out, it's a bit fitting to see Kevin Spacey play someone behind bars. This probably should be better than it is but unfortunately it's just middling."
" I fought the capital (and the capital won). But it's still funny
",0.4939,0.9201,2019-08-28 00:00:00,6,"Classical American comedy (with the sketches based on sex, drugs, violence, politically incorrect etc), but with an original plot as the first one. In reality the ""original"" plot, based on a rare (for a mainstream American comedy) case of fight between classes (but it is always lived with the aim of enrichment, so in a capitalistic point of view), were used in the first film, so here works more as a repetition. But the story (a kidnap) is dynamic, the sketches are funny and the movie is a good comedy, especially if we think that's a sequel."
" Horrible Bosses 2
",-0.5423,0.6808,2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,7/10 - funny follow-up that matches the comedic prowess of its predecessor
" my notes
",0.0,0.9887,2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Hilarious with a cool new clever story. lot's of interesting characters. very similar feel to the first one but with a different story. the addition of Chris Pine was great. He played that role perfectly. Another to add to the list of characters in this movie that are perfectly played by the actor (Kevin spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx). however the comedy sometimes feels forced where in the first one it felt so natural. and at times it seemed like the main characters were too outrageous and not believable, not to the fault of the actors but that of the director or script (4 viewings)"
" ""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" HAR HAR HAR
",0.0,0.9992,2019-05-28 00:00:00,1,"""Babies are like... potatoes with arms."" This is just one of the many scenes where Jason Sudeikis can't hold himself, breaks character and smirks at his own joke, in the early minutes of Horrible Bosses 2. Probably a sign of the horrors to follow. Along with scream-queen Charlie Day, Sudeikis plays a part of a trio of wannabe modern-day Stooges. The third part of the trio is Jason Bateman, who is forever doomed to play the straight man in comedy duos, trios and the rest.Not having seen the first movie, which I heard was actually funny, I went into this one with very little expectations. The plot involves the trio mentioned above, who come up with a simple product that could sell quite well and make them rich quick. But their investor is a cunning old fox, he screws them so bad that they're left with nothing. Nothing to do, except make him pay.While this sounds like a nice premise, what follows in the movie has little relation to it. This film could have the plot of Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane or any Hitchcock film, and you still wouldn't remember anything about it afterwards. Charlie Day's constant screeching will drown out any thoughts you may have about the story.The main idea in a nutshell, the very basic concept of comedy that's being mass-marketed to audiences here, is this: ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny."" How in the world this slipped through the meetings with the studio execs, the first drafts of the script, the later drafts, and afterwards slipped through the whole shooting process, without anyone noticing anything fishy about it, is a mystery.There are many, I mean MANY scenes in this film, ranging from 15 seconds to many long minutes, that consist of solely three guys yelling at once. Nothing else happens in these scenes, just constant yelling. It's impossible to understand anything that's being said, and if you happen to actually catch a word or phrase through all that noise, it's impossible to make out who said it. It doesn't matter, anyway. Because the big shots up there, holding the ropes to moviemaking for all the world to see, have decided that ""Three guys talking and yelling all at once is funny.""An example of the comedy routine, that's repeated many, many times throughout: Charlie Day starts yelling (you'd think his voice doesn't have any other mode) then the others join in the yelling... then Day suddenly shuts up and sits down extremely cool, like nothing happened, his hands on his lap, knees together, lips puckered, and... yes, you guessed it: eyes rolled up. Hello, and welcome to cheap comedy troupes from the 1920's. I almost expected a pie fight.Of course, the movie could still be somewhat funny if there were a few elements of real comedy, like well-written side characters. Like the Jamie Foxx character, ""MF Jones."" He's supposed to be very funny, and the audience is supposed to roll on the floor, breathless from laughter, because his name is MF. Get it? Now if you don't think a guy named MF is funny, you're missing what comedy is all about. Foxx doesn't utter a single funny line in his scenes. The whole premise of this character being funny is that his name is MF.Christoph Waltz, on the other hand, proves that he's one of the best, most convincing actors of our times. I've seen him on promotional interviews, saying ""...they (Sudeikis, Day and Bateman) are three of the funniest guys in show business."" And he said it without losing it. He didn't spit out his coffee or start laughing at his own words (unlike Sudeikis). He actually said this with a completely serious, straight face. His masterful acting was extremely out-of-place in a movie like this.Jennifer Aniston gives the strong impression that she was sick of her goody two shoes image from Friends and the by-the-book romantic comedies that followed, and craved to show audiences that she had a sexual side as well. She obviously wants to be recognized as a real hottie, a female, anything that is seen as a ""woman"", instead of ""Rachel"". Why wasn't I surprised that on the same promotional reels, the producers said ""She wrote some of the most explicit sexual lines herself"" ? You get the feeling that she'd even pay to have a role like this, rather than get paid.There is only one single line in the whole movie that's laugh-out-loud funny, and unfortunately it comes from Sudeikis, which made it somehow less funny. It's mind-boggling that he was given a part in these movies. He's never in character, he's Jason Sudeikis all along. I have never seen an actor so in love with himself, with his image, who finds himself so attractive and charming. He even surpasses Johnny Depp in that regard. A man who, if possible, would marry himself."
" Uncessary fun!

" What More Could You Ask For?
",0.0,0.9932,2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Now, 8 stars is probably pushing it. Perhaps 7.5 would do justice. But Chris Pine is one of my favorite actors, and I really liked him in this movie.The first film had the hilarious slapstick comedy, and this one is basically just as good. The three main actors are all really talented and funny throughout, and the small business aspect of this movie was great. I truly enjoyed it, you should see this ASAP.7.5 stars"
" slightly lazy cash-in
",-0.2975,0.8132,2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"The first half is slow, and misses the fun provided in the first film by the bosses - Kevin Spacek's is the only really funny scene - and also the grounding in reality provided by the characters' jobs. Without that they just seem like three overgrown schoolboys acting daft. It picks up in the second half and there's some funny schtick, but it never quite loses the feel of a laboured, cash-in sequel."
" I tried.
",0.0,-0.8247,2018-12-04 00:00:00,2,"I really did. But I just couldn't sit through it. The beginning of the movie tells you all you need to know. Remember that old joke where the shadow of someone behind a curtain seems to be doing really dirty things? That's the opening gag in this movie, so I knew immediately that I was not in for a treat like the original. It just kept nosediving from there with an overplayed Macklemore song, a lackluster and forgettable Christoph Waltz villain, some painful jokes on par with the first one, and altogether a movie that should've been much better than the cash grab we were given. That being said, this movie was a better sequel than Hangover 2 because it was different than the first. I know it's ridiculous that yields bonus points for a bad movie, but the Hangover franchise set a new low. This movie is still a bad sequel because although it didn't steal anything old, it didn't bring any good new material to the table. I believe I saw Chris Pine fightclubbing himself, so I guess that's a highlight, but other than that this was a big nothing."
" a new eviler boss
",-0.4767,-0.8928,2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,Review: I really didn't like this movie because it really didn't add all that much to what the first movie brought to the table. The direction and screenplay really aren't all that great. The casting and acting really aren't all that great except for the exception of Christoph Waltz a rather vile investor and his son Rex played by Chris Pine. All in all I would give this a star out of a possible five stars.
" More cringe than comedy
",0.4144,0.6581,2018-09-24 00:00:00,1,"The first part was average. The second is just painful to watch. More screams than any horror movies, everyone screaming at each other. Writers think that's funny in some way, but not even good to make kids laugh. Storyline is pretty much the same as the first one, only with new characters. Cameo appearance from Jamie Foxx was pretty good, rest was annoing AF."

They sign a contract which ends up with the parent company screwing them over. They opt to kidnap Rex, the boss's son (Chris Pine) but mess that up. As it turns out Rex wants to be kidnapped and helps them out. As in the first feature things blow up in their face.Aniston revives her foul mouthed role which made the first feature super fun. However the comedy in this film is end loaded and it takes a long time for the laughs to come.My advice is a rental.Guide: F-bomb, brief small screen sex. No nudity. Crude humor."
" Pretty good for a sequel
",0.7269,0.9788,2018-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Personally I loved both the first movie and this one. Although the storyline is a little predictable it definitely is funny and it's great to see everyone from the first movie in the second movie with the exception of Colin Farrell. (Obviously) I love Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day and Jason Bateman together and I'd definitely watch another movie with these three. Is this sequel Oscar worthy? No, but it is definitely funny and a pretty good sequel."
" Dumb Yes; Yet Funny
",0.3182,0.5094,2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Funnier than most modern stupid comedies; low bar. Thus achieves its objective. Three yahoos quit their job because the movie's title implies they have horrible bosses and attempt to start their own business to be their own bosses with a silly 'shower buddy' invention. They get screwed by an investor and concoct a revenge scheme. Will they be able to pull it off to save their new business? There are oodles of lewd hijinks blended with lots of sexual and potty humor. While the movie often pokes fun at itself and its movie genre, it did it's best to cobble together a mix tape soundtrack to medium success. Overall, there are some good zingers, a couple plot twists and eye rolling situations but above average for the genre."
" Yeah, it's a sequel alright...
",0.296,0.8422,2018-06-09 00:00:00,4,"This sequel was not even half as fun and entertaining as the first ""Horrible Bosses"" movie was. Why? Well, it just had too much of a mundane and generic storyline, and it was lacking the originality and humor that was present in the first movie.Sure the movie had a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and it was nice to see people revisit their roles from the first movie, but it was a shame that they had so very little to work with in terms of a proper script and storyline. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day certainly did carry the movie. It was also some nice performances from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz and Jonathan Banks, just a shame that they had such small roles to play.There were some casual laughs here and there, but the movie just felt forced and was running on autopilot. And that is what made this movie crash and burn for me. It simply lacked originality and the ability to bring out some good and proper laughs.This is hardly a movie that you will watch a second time."

Why does Charlie Day have to yell all his lines and pretend he's still on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia? Why does Jason Sudiekis always have to be a male chauvinistic pig? Jason Bateman is the only one of the three worth watching here."

The well timed humor and crazy scenarios make the movie enjoyable. Some of the jokes are oversexualized but still funny.The acting throughout is great. Jason Bateman and Jamie Foxx steal the show.The pacing is a little slow and the film does have an overly long runtime. Jennifer Aniston once again looks smoking hot.Pros: Well timed humor, great acting, funny plot, and Jennifer Aniston's sweet bodyCons: Slow pacing, overly long runtime, and some overly sexualized jokesOverall Rating: 7.0"

First movie was good, guys were crazy a little bit, not ridiculously foolish. But this time it really sucked. The situation does not entertain movie audience, but only makes us feel annoyed & nervous."

With an entirely different purpose yet the same cast and the same concept, as well as the same comedy-smart screenplay and whatnot.If there be a third part, I would definitely check it out !8/10"

",0.3182,0.9538,2017-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Simply awful. After a 34 painful minutes both my wife and I looked at each other and agreed that enough was enough. For us, Charlie Day's prepubescent squawking was the movie buster. No man, even with a beard should sound like that-ever.I'm sure there is an audience for this type of film and it appears to have made a lot of money, but each set piece was far worse than the last. The three original Three Stooges would have been cringing at this pile of poo. Even the American Pie series came across as positively 'Shakesperean'.It would be better all round if these actors went their separate ways and considered it best 'a place not to re-visit ever again'. I sincerely hope the makers do not think of making another sequel or even worse still...........a prequel."
" Love and adore Horrible Bosses 2
",0.6486,0.9824,2017-09-14 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely love the entire case of this movie. First of all, Jason Bateman's personality and joke delivery is flawless. He must be a pleasure to be around as he seems like just a funny jokester. Jennifer Anniston, so good at being bad, her character in this movie has me dying with laughter. The entire cast is super talented in their own comedic way, but Jennifer and Jason were my favorites. Funny, funny stuff."
" No ... seriously, just no!
",-0.6588,-0.967,2017-08-21 00:00:00,1,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have watched this so soon after watching the first one for the second time (though why I actually did that is beyond me), because I literally got to the point where I simply wanted to scream in agony, and the main reason was because it was just so painful to watch our protagonists go about acting like complete jerks. Sure, that was the point of the movie, but sitting through this film watching a bunch of bumbling idiots stumble from one stupid scene to the next just made me want to twist and turn in agony, yet for some bizarre reason I watched it to the end (then again I am one of those people that will rarely, if ever, stop watching a film halfway through).Well, I have now finished watching the film, so I can legitimately write a review of it, and I can honestly tell the entire world to simply not bother at all – this film is rubbish, painful, all copies of it should be destroyed and it should never see the light of day again. In fact I am surprised that I gave the first movie as high a rating as I did because in all honestly the original film wasn't all that much better. Okay, our idiotic protagonists are a little more tolerable in the original, but only barely.This film has our protagonists trying to start up their own business manufacturing something called the 'shower buddy', but since they are not really cold, hard, and experienced businessmen, they end up getting taken for a ride and find themselves deeply in debt. So, as is the case with the previous film, they decide to take matters into their own hands to attempt to solve the problem by breaking the law, though as it turns out they end up escaping any real penalty.Personally, I wouldn't recommend this at all. Sure, maybe it is that I simply don't like the bumbling idiot type of comedy, and after watching this film I can clearly state that I really don't like this type of comedy. The other thing is that they are basically getting much cruder, and much more offensive, though not offensive in the sense that Southpark is offensive, but rather attempting to be like that and failing miserably. Personally, give this film a wide berth."
" Not bad for a comedy sequel
",0.1877,0.9417,2017-08-19 00:00:00,5,"I watched both 'Horrible Bosses' films back to back and it's clear that the first movie is the better of the two. 'Horrible Bosses 2' has its moments but lacks ideas and the originality of the first film. The guys are a lot more stupid in the sequel, they reminded me a lot of the Hangover trio. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, but they weren't that dumb in the first film.By the standards of the average comedy movie, it's not bad. I laughed a few times, which is more than can be said about a lot of comedy sequels. Like in the first film, Aniston and Sudeikis are the highlight for me. Both are brilliant in their roles. 'Horrible Bosses 2' isn't as bad as some would have you believe, but there's a clear lack of ideas here."

",0.0,0.9887,2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"This is not one that will become a classic, but it is entertaining and will get some laughs out of you. You must of course like comedies with stupid characters making stupid decisions.I remember watching the first one and felt that it wasn't as entertaining as this one.The first part is kind of slow, but it builds quickly and you get into the movie. What will happen next? How are they gonna get out of that situation?Some «iconic» scenes of the first movie are referred to, but they were shorter thus I found them funnier, as I felt too much time was spent on these jokes in the first movie. Laugh once, get on to the next joke; It was much better.And the car chase is really great and something out of the ordinary. That sequence should be classified with the «most memorable movie car chases».I was torn between giving it a 6 or a 7 out of 10 and decided to go with 7 because I prefer to be in the «Love it» camp than in the «Hate it» camp. It's really not that bad."

The son of a huge catalog company, Rex Hanson (Chris Pine) calls them in and makes an offer - a one time fee and their company takes over the product. The guys refuse, then find out the offer was for $3 million and is now off the table.Then Rex's dad (Christoph Waltz) enters the office, orders 100,000 units, and gives them the name of his bank so they can obtain a loan and get started. After they have manufactured the units, daddy totally screws them over, as he planned to all along. The guys find themselves out $500,000 and have lost rights to their product. It's time to take their usual ineffectual action. And this time, they have an unlikely ally.The usual suspects are back - Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and they're all very good. The humor in this film seemed even raunchier than the first, unappreciated by yours truly, which is why I hate these comedies.Chris Pine was hilarious, and Christoph Waltz was excellent as well.The best part? The outtakes during the closing credits."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,0.988,2017-06-13 00:00:00,4,"Okay, I understand that people love sequels and it's usually a guaranteed win at the box office, but did we really need another Horrible Bosses movie? In this unnecessary sequel, the boys have gone into business for themselves, and in common fashion have signed away their invention to an investor for a fraction of what it's worth. Realizing they've been taken, they plan on kidnapping the billionaires son and the ridiculousness begins again. The old bosses and old accomplishes join new face for another adventure that's even more absurd than the first one was. I watched this film because I love Jason Sudeikis, he is one of my favorite comedic actors, however Charlie Day is not. I really don't know how anyone can stand watching It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, with this little guy running around, with his high pitched rabbit voice, always excited like he just did an eight ball before every single scene he shoots. It's honestly one of the most annoying things I can think of. This film was kind of lame and leaned toward the stupid side to begin with, but when you add this little squirrel on crack to the mix, it really becomes nearly unwatchable. The bottom line, sequels make money. Some people want to learn the fate of characters they've seen and gotten to know. Then there are people like me, who went to see the first one and even though they weren't crazy about it, figured I might as well go see the next one. I can only hope at this point they don't decide to make it into a trilogy."
" If you liked the first one, you'll like this
",0.6486,0.4374,2017-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Just as raunchy and filthy as its predecessors, Horrible Bosses 2 feature the same three leads and follows them through their wild, only-in-Hollywood adventures.Without spoiling any plot points from the first one, I'll just say that the sequel's plot is slightly different. In this one, the three friends decide to become their own bosses. Start-up businesses are hard, and when two good-looking rich guys (Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine, in case you were wondering) get in their way, the three idiots come up with a plan that's, well, not a good or legal idea.If you didn't like the first one, you're not going to like the second one. If you're over fifty or don't like raunchy, twenty-something humor, you're not going to like either one. If you liked the first one, chances are you'll think this one's funny, too.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual jokes and adult situations, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
" Liked it more than the first one
",0.4215,0.9289,2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie way more than the first time. I actually enjoyed watching this, while the humour was of course sometimes a bit dumb, but like the first one, Horrible Bosses 2 is a dark comedy. When done well it can me hilarious, when done poorly it can be absolutely horrendous. With Horrible Bosses 2 they did an okay job. Sometimes the dark jokes go too far, but sometimes they are also just right.Still I got to laugh a lot, which is always a good thing when watching comedies. One thing that bothers me though is that the name is still Horrible Bosses while there really isn't a horrible boss here, not as clearly a in the first one at least. This is what can happen if you make a sequel when you didn't exactly plan it carefully. It has the title, and while Horrible Bosses 2 had a better plot, better twist, it's still carrying the name which is a bit ehh."

Dale does get annoying, but mostly the three work well together. I was glad to see so many of the characters return. So it was a fun sequel, nothing to get excited about, but enjoyable."
" Same winning combination as the first movie.
",0.5267,0.9073,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"When their new business fails, lovable losers Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis) and Dale (Day) plot their revenge on the slick investor who ripped them off them (Christoph Waltz) by kidnapping his son (Chris Pine) and demanding a ransom.The good news is that Horrible Bosses 2 brings back most of the things fans of the original liked about it. Original horrible bosses Spacey and Aniston get a couple of scenes each, and they are funny. New additions vary in effectiveness. Christoph Waltz and (in particular) Chris Pine are great picks to fill the antagonist slots. It's the same winning combination as the first movie, with silly, hilarious situations , my favorite probably being the Ocean's 11 style slick plan that goes totally haywire.The rude & crude humor, that's trademarked by the R-rated Jennifer Aniston who returns as Sex addicted dentist Julia. Bateman, Sudeikis & Day are on top form, ably supported by the returning characters of aforementioned Jenifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx (Django) as the shady ""MF"" Jones & Kevin Spacey as the hard boiled Harken. The fresh injections of Chirs Pine & Christoph Waltz are class, particularly Pine whose frenetic, zany prankster is priceless.Conclusion, Horrible Bosses 2 is a solid sequel, the continuity of the characters/atmosphere , new story with some surprises up it's sleeve & fresh injection of characters make for a fun time. Don't listen to the bad reviews if you liked the first movie, you will also like this one too. 8 out of 10"
" Working Nine to Five
",0.0,0.9541,2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Kidnapping rather than murder is on the agenda this time round as the three friends from the first film look to get revenge on a shady businessman who tricked them out of a fortune in this follow-up to the 2011 hit comedy. Most of the original cast is back and while Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Aniston are given disappointingly little to do, the chemistry between the three leads is as strong as ever with their great comic timing the main reason to see the film. Unfortunately, the characters seem even more inept, clumsy and foolish this time round, which sometimes makes them difficult to relate to. They each have their fair share of funny moments though, with Jason Bateman's mistaken belief that he has waltzed into an AA meeting a clear highlight as well as the opening scene in which an automatic shower invention looks incredibly 'wrong' when viewed at a certain angle. Not all the gags are that good (an extra-long freight train is excruciating) but ultimately the film has more hits than misses with a cunning Chris Pine actually outclassing Christoph Waltz as his even slyer father. As with the first film, movie references are used to good effect too. All the 'Predator' quips are highly amusing, as is the trio modeling their kidnapping on 'Nine to Five' and then debating who of them is the Fonda, Tomlin and Parton of their clan. Sure, this is not as fresh and funny as the first film... but how many comedy sequels are? Viewed with the right expectations, it is hard to imagine the film disappointing anyone who liked the trio's chemistry in Part One."
