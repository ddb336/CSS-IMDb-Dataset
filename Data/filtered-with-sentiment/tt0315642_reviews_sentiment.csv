" Good thriller
",0.5106,0.872,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,You can start predicting the movie from the starting I predicted all except one thing apart from that it's a good thiller with realistic touch Farhan was awesome apart from that its a good watch not a must watch.
" Good thriller
",0.5106,0.9488,2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"A pretty normal story with some great tweaks and thrills and mystery topped up by some great performances makes it a really enjoyable movie. The fact that it has no ""bad elements"" makes it a family movie too.
Amitabh ji and Farhan did great. Manav Kaul was again impressive, as he is always in a negative role.A must watch if you're into bollywood thrillers. Don't miss this one."
" Let's play a mind game called life, what can you sacrifice to win it?
",0.7351,0.9387,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
clever screenplay; the movie engages the viewers with a great start and ends with a satisfying overall movie viewing experience. The movie is crisp, to the point and keeps the tight screenplay thrilling. What works also is the lead characters of the movie all equally performed well. The movie worked better also because of the detailed and exciting narrative.What did not work:
songs except the introduction ones could have been taken away. The opening song added a very positive cinematographic narrative.some very minor flaws which could have been avoided but overall considerableFinal verdict: recommended"
" A Nail-Biting Finish with a Very Smart Job by Both Leading Actors!
",0.5081,0.9914,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"After hearing ""Tere Bin"" Song of both my favorite Singers (Sonu Nigam & Shreya Ghoshal combo) for long 4 years, I suddenly thought about let's Check Wazir's reviews over various online platforms and surprisingly I got the result of very decent ratings of this movie and some friends over social media also recommended me to watch it.Then I considered it in my watchlist during this Lockdown time and here I have just watched it NOW!I will definitely do my Hats off for both Actors Acting performance. Both (Amitabh Bacchan ji and Farhaan Akhtar Sir) did a Fine job in this entire movie. They just justified their characters here and I really likes the movies of Farhaan Akhtar, whether he's Acting, Producing or even directing a Movie. He's just a Gem of Talent.The Length of the Movie is quite restricted around 90to100minutes which is definitely a Plus point for this movie to entertain it's viewers. And for this reason I will surely applause for Movie editor here.
And Finally the Story! OMG! Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you're such a great story writer for sure because of your connection between Chess Game and Movies Characters! Story is definitely watchable with Family in fact this movie is for every age group people because here in this movie non PG required to watch.I will go for 7 Out of 10 Stars because it's really Entertained me A lot especially at it's ending when Plot Twisted and Something amazing happened which was beyond our imagination."

" Enjoyable, Very Brave Attempt
",0.7645,0.0754,2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"A Gripping Thriller and Very enjoyable
And the climax of the movie Is what Steals The Show"
" Wasted opportunity
",-0.1027,0.5525,2020-04-25 00:00:00,3,"It started off promisingly and very soon petered off into yet another typical Bollywood style thriller - all action no substance.A stellar cast let down by a weak script and fuzzy storyline. You are given tragedy, sadness, anger, frustration, romance, action, and some ridiculous plots. I sat through the nonsense drama essentially for Farhan and AB, but gradually they too let you down.Slick production values a good movie does not make.Shame. Could have been so much better."
" Wazir: Starring Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar
",0.0,0.7964,2020-04-08 00:00:00,7,Loss of loved ones brings two friends together. Things reveal as they play the game of chess. An emotional-thriller filled with action and a mention of the political stage in Kashmir Valley. Characters backstory could have been more appropriately filmed.
" FARHAN AKHTAR SCREAMS ARE EQUALLY HORRIBLE
",-0.6908,-0.5994,2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,"The movie is spoilt everytime Farhan tries to scream, its hollow, there is no voice,"
" Brilliant crime mystery.
",0.0772,0.7579,2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,Screen Play is superb and Amitabh sir and Farhaan Akhtar is on point too.
" Hollow.
",0.0,0.4404,2020-03-20 00:00:00,6,Essence less and Hollow. Could have made a better.
" Suspense suspense
",0.0,0.8481,2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Awesome ending and awesome suspense.
Must watch and Bollywood should work on this kind of movies"
" Silly nonsense
",-0.3818,0.8968,2019-12-24 00:00:00,2,"Good lead cast, but the story became unbelievable very quickly. The final twist made no sense: there are story lines that are impractical but plausible, and then there is this nonsense.unanswered questions and large plot holes. Very underwhelming finished product given the star cast. Farhan and manav kaul acted well, Amitabh was over the top in this role, and Aditi Rao Hydari could have been replaced by a mannequin to deliver more or less the same results. Seema Pahwa is a treat to watch normally, but played too minor a role (an unwitting bumpkin) to shine through."
" Wazir
",0.0,0.9737,2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,Good Movie. Everybody acted very well in the movie. The lead characters acting were especially excellent in the movie. There are many songs in the movie which made the movie somewhat lagged. BGM in the movie was good. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. The movie was unpredictable. The movie had many twists which made the movie more interesting. Fight scenes in the movie was good. Good Movie.
" Farhan Akhtar is anti India
",-0.3182,-0.3182,2019-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Since Farhan Akhtar is anti India, his movies seem distasteful by his sheer presence in them"
" Awesome
",0.6249,0.8402,2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Simply amazing
" Pridictably poor, utter disappointment!
",-0.7712,0.4939,2019-10-07 00:00:00,2,"I so wanted to watch it since it was released, had a chance to watch it on Netflix this weekend and found it to be equal part disappointing. Average acting by actors, Farhan most intrested in showing off his biceps, actress more in showing off her looks than acting and people like me would see the plot (supposed to be mystrey) coming from miles. Movie was better in my imagination than in reality."
" Full of propaganda movie
",-0.25,-0.3182,2019-10-02 00:00:00,1,Waste of be time. Waste of talented actor Amitav Bacchan.
" Not completely unpredictable.
",0.0,-0.3252,2019-09-25 00:00:00,7,It was not completely unpredictable.Or may be I have already watched it and I just didn't remember it. Lol.
" Lights, camera, action!
",0.0,-0.836,2019-09-22 00:00:00,9,"Wazir (2016)
Action, Crime, DramaWazir (2016) is all about a grief-stricken cop who is raging in anger Post his daughter's death in a firing and an amputee grandmaster. They are brought together by a peculiar twist of fate as part of a wider conspiracy that has darkened their lives.The concept & script and ofcourse the film work overall makes this movie stand out. It is much better by far, as compared to most of the Bollywood Movies . There were some plot holes, but it depends upon how the viewer perceives it. I perceived those to be clues for the viewers. Dots to be joined in order to make sense out of the plot in the end."
" My Review!
",0.0,0.6955,2019-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Frankly, when you put two **A** class actors in a movie together, you expect to feel WOW but, I was like..hm! Not the best work, could've done better. The story was too deep. It needn't have been. One time watch, I would say. You miss, it's okay.Peace Out! :)"
" How to spoil a good premise!!
",0.5399,0.6793,2019-08-19 00:00:00,5,"A smart movie. Just 137 mins. All fine.
But so many silly high flowing Urdu songs!!! Farhan Akthar is miscasted. Amit ji under utilized. Could have been a much better movie! And then the last bit where there is the pen drive explanation, Indian audience is stupid anyway ðŸ˜­! The film makers need to respect the cine goers and stop spoon feeding us!!!"
" Best for those who love twist in movie
",0.8555,-0.7669,2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,The person who knows sorrow behind the silence of a person. This movie tell you that if personal life is affected by professional life then he will do his duties without taking care of his life.
" Waste of Time
",-0.4215,0.5994,2017-10-24 00:00:00,1,"Save yourself the trouble and enjoy something else, The story the use of props and stunts all seem out of place unfinished or improperly performed. Seems like the producer run out of money and director out of ides and actors out of talent. Worst Amitabh movie i have seen.Film seems to be lacking in every thing, its a movie just for the sake of it"
" Predictable
",0.0,0.6005,2017-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Movie is so predictable. Maybee its due to moderate editing. Overall concept & script was awesome. Dialogues are good too. Far better then most of Bollywood Movies .All movie is just rolling around 4 or 5 persons most of the time. As usual romance in Bollywood always so bad. , they are just looking at each other all the movie till the end,and background music make it worst."
" Just a little better than ""time-pass""
",0.3832,0.6494,2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"Wazir is a film with stereotypical cinematography/direction (especially the love scenes), a horribly failed attempt at playing a mad character by Neil Nitin Mukesh, and just barely believable performances by the usually talented Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar. The music, although carrying the weight of the talented musicians behind it, doesn't adequately carry the heavy emotions of the film itself. Despite all these flaws, the twist at the end makes it just a little better than time-pass, so, watch it if you have time to pass."
" Catch the Wazir
",0.0,-0.9875,2017-07-13 00:00:00,5,"For Bollywood standards Wazir is rather a short film with fewer songs and more gun toting and violent action. It also places an emphasis on chess which means someone is being played.Daanish Ali is an anti terrorism officer whose daughter dies in a shootout when Ali eyes a wanted suspect. However his daughter's death makes him distraught, he splits with his wife and is near suicidal.He comes into contact with Panditji a paralysed chess grandmaster who taught chess to his late daughter. Both form a friendship through mutual grief as Panditji also loss his daughter which he blames on an aspiring political leader, Qureshi.When Panditji is threatened by some cronies of Qureshi, Ali takes it upon himself to exact revenge, only to realise somebody was always a few moves ahead of him.This is a well acted film by Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar, with high production standards and photography, although it is not always consistent and the editing is choppy. The film's twist is rather ludicrous if you think about it."
