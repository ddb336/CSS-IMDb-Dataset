" Hilarious family horror with a satisfying ending
",0.25,-0.9852,2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,"It was really funny when the other family arrived. Toni Collette was awesome as usual. When their son tore his letter to Santa Claus and threw it away from the window, the storm clouds gathered and the howling blizzard brought Krampus and his elves and the toys came to life along with Christmas cookies. The german grandmother kept telling they should feed the fire at the fireplace because it keeps them away. Their daughter wanted to check his boyfriend and became the first victim to krampus. The fathers went out to look for her and Howard got attacked from beneath the snow by something like a creature in tremors and the scot boy saved him. Howard kept the first watch but fell asleep and the fire went out and they took his fat son from the chimney. The girls were lured up into the attic and the toys that were possessed fighting the humans were really hilarious. The clown puppet, the chucky's bride doll with wings and a robot with a knife. And Howard got attacked by Christmas cookies and the dog ate one of them and saved Howard. They wanted to drive away with the plowing truck. The grandmother locked herself in and wanted to face it as she summoned it back in war torn Germany. It took her and the adults were all suck into the ground by the tremor thing. Minions took the last girl and the gate to hell opened in the ground. No matter how hard he asked for everything to be reversed, both were thrown into lavas. He woke up in the Christmas morning and all seemed normal except for his present was the sleigh bell of krampus as a reminder of what happens when Christmas spirit is lost. They were trapped in a snow globe and Krampus put it away on a shelf next to other snow globes. Krampus looked really good with the evil face of Santa Claus and a body of a crooked giant goat."
" So underrated
",0.0,0.9205,2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie for Christmas, not expecting much of it. This movie really surprised me: the plot is creative, the acting is great, and the ending has possibly the biggest twist of all time. (I might be exaggerating.)Although some scenes are a little creepy, nothing is too scary, so it's one of those horror movies that are fun and don't give you nightmares.I could definitely watch Krampusevery year at Christmas."
" Cozy Christmas scare
",-0.4939,0.0,2020-12-30 00:00:00,6,A different kinda Christmas movie to watch when you're getting tired of the Hallmarks. Although the first half of the movie is much better than the second half.
" An interesting and dark Christmas twist thriller. A nice recommendation but not for young children.
",0.4497,0.5323,2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,"Thriller / fantasy film. It shows in a very dark way the story of Krampus, a tragic demonic entity similar to Baal, who, unlike the story of Santa Claus, goes out at Christmas not to distribute gifts but to collect souls as punishment for a lost spirit. of Christmas. A special thriller and not a Christmas movie for the whole family, especially not for young children. It has suspense and darkness all along and despite the small doses of humor here and there, it is purely thriller. I would prefer them to completely remove the humor and intensify the horror so that it clearly becomes a horror film and becomes very strong. However, even with the mix of genres, it is an interesting thriller recommendation."
" Silly alternative horror comedy Christmas film
",-0.2732,-0.2083,2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"REVIEW - KRAMPUSQuestion, do you know what Krampus is?In Austria and Germany they believe in the opposite to St. Nicholas, St. Nicholas who is St. Nicholas?St. Nicholas is or was Father Christmas otherwise known as Santa Clause or Chris Kringle. I'm not going to go into why St. Nicholas has so many different names but I'm simply going to explain for the premise of the film and story.Krampus has been used for centuries to remind children to be good or it won't be St. Nicholas who visits it will be Krampus, who doesn't give but takes.In essence this is a silly horror comedy film and they knew it when making it adding extra layers of Christmas cheese to the mix to create a few lough out loud moments and I don't usually like comedy horrors but I loved this alternative take on Christmas, from the killer gingerbread men to the Christmas lawn decorations.Brilliant alternative take on Christmas but actually reinforced the message and meaning of Christmas not through some sloppy story but one I actually enjoyed.You'll either love this one or hate it.Rating 9 out of 10"
" If you like Gremlings, you like this one
",0.6124,0.7394,2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I think it is a good movie, and kind of like the Gremlings - it's kind of creepy but weirdly funny as well"
" Underrated Christmas Horror
",-0.5719,-0.9451,2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Firstly, Krampus scares the same way Gremlins does. Maybe a tiny bit scarier in parts but overall not paranormal activity or conjuring levels. Its not jump scares but sinister imagery and monsters that scare you here.The first part is well scripted and quite comical as the relatives that don't get on turn up with well-timed comedy insults flying around, really well actually.
Then the Krampus and his many scary helpers turn up.Production, acting and script are first class and it is a really well made movie. Its just not really scary or gory but its not really supposed to be. Although its 15 certified its only a few expletives I feel that really make it not suitable for anyone younger.
Krampus is a decent Christmas scare movie thats well worth a watch."
" Highly underrated
",0.0,0.8611,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely worth a watch for any horror fan, I will say that got repetitive in the last 15 minutes, and it almost felt like a film that had 45 minutes of substance, but they dragged it out to 90 minutes, but it's still a pretty good movie"
" You better watch out...
",0.4404,0.8498,2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"'Krampus (2015)' is centred around the myth of its eponymous creature, a dark reflection of Santa Claus who punishes naughty children - and, in this case, entire families. The narrative involves an extended family gathering that goes a little bit wrong when an argument breaks out between cousins with opposing views on whether or not Father Christmas is real. When all Christmas spirit is sapped from the family, Krampus is called to drag them all to hell. Most of the movie involves various members of the family being picked off by the big bad's various minions, learning to work together as they try to find a way out of their bleak situation. There are scenes in which it feels as though it wants to be a full-on comedy-horror, which are probably its most successful moments. The movie never goes far enough down this path, though. As such, it doesn't so much as feel cohesive as it does tonally inconsistent. Still, the affair maintains a decent atmosphere throughout and is coated with a looming sense of dread. It's rather visceral, at times, despite being relatively bloodless. It's also straight-up silly at others, even though its stakes are always sincere. It all comes together in an ending that sort of seems rushed. It's not bad, but it feels a little half-baked and doesn't quite have the impact it perhaps should. Overall, this is a relatively enjoyable alternate Christmas flick. It isn't all that scary and it isn't all that funny, but it works well enough to be worth a watch during the holiday season. 6/10"
" A Dark Christmas classic
",0.0,0.9871,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"You should know going into this that this is not a light-hearted Christmas tale or an all out horror movie.. Instead, Krampus is a holiday tale for people who like things a little on the dark side. Beyond a doubt this movie is not going to be to everyone's taste. Technically this film is beautifully shot and the sound effects are outstanding. I watch this in my own theatre and it looks and sounds incredible. The acting is top notch from everyone in the cast, personally I love these characters because they are realistically human, not Hollywood fake. The sets and atmosphere are perfect and most of all, so is Krampus himself and his helpers. The costumes coupled with the special effects are dazzling. I watch this every year now because if you like your Christmas tales on the twisted side, this is a classic, it's brilliant, also genuinely frightening and at times very funny. If heartwarming is what you are looking for, this is not the film to watch, which I think is why some people don't like it."
" Nope!
",0.0,-0.9952,2020-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Production values Check. A list Actors like Toni Collette Check. The rest of the movie as far as storyline, plot, continuity, or even sense then NO. Krampus comes for badly behaved children but Max was not a bad kid. He got into a fight in the opening sequence that was later explained as a bully bothering him. Idk about you but a 10 yr old scrapping once doesn't warrant his entire family and him basically going to hell for eternity. The ending was trite, unnecessary and the movie itself is just a stream of disconnected tropes. The family dynamic wasn't enough to make their fate seem deserved. Krampus takes evil wicked immoral children. Max throughout the entire film acted like a typical normal child for his age. Why was Krampus even there let alone set upon punishing what the film showed was a normal kid is beyond me, because he ripped a letter and tree it out his window! The parents in this were more problematic and not even Max's parents came off that terrible. The aunt and uncle were decidedly heinous but again this had no bearing on the outcome. The finale seemed like a rushed stretch and the movie left you feeling like wtf did I just watch and I can't get my 1.5 hours of my life back. If you want to waste time I'd recommend this but other than that watch Hereditary with Toni Colette and forget this travesty."
" A Christmas horror movie for the modern day
",-0.5719,0.7526,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"I think this is a highly underrated modern horro/Christmas movie. It doesn't necessarily fit all the cliché tropes because it is a creature feature with the holiday emphasis, and for the effort of the production and quality, it sets itself apart in a way that puts it on your list of annual must-watch Christmas movies, especially if you're a horror fan.
Director Michael Daughtry said in the special features and directors commentary that he was heavily influenced by classic 70s and 80s horror movies and their production, and tried to use practical effects and props when possible, as well as adding humor to the script. I feel that adds some quality to the movie magic and makes it that much more of an entertaining film to watch. Pair that with the message it gets across about the spirit of the season and it really packs a punch for your Christmas party."
" Great beginning.... very rough middle & end
",0.6249,-0.7077,2020-12-24 00:00:00,3,"I absolutely LOVED the first 20 minutes of this movie. Great writing, characters, and foreshadowing for the ensuing horror... but as soon as the horror elements came into play- everything else seemed to go out the window. The editing was jumpy, there was little to no plot or character development, and the ending was beyond disappointing. I'm almost upset at this movie because of how much I liked the first act."
" Appalling
",-0.3612,-0.1243,2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, are you people on drugs who liked this? Like seriously?"
" A Christmas scare that offers tons of fun for the audience
",0.0258,0.9636,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Sags a bit in the middle but Michael Dougherty's Christmas scare, 'Krampus,' still offers tons of fun for the audience. It's both lighthearted and funny but also surprisingly horrifying. The movie features strong acting all around with leads Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and David Koechner providing wonderful performances. 'Krampus' also features a wealth of fantastic effects, from the evil toys, to the elves, and especially Krampus himself. There is no lack of great creature effects."
" Pretty good story
",0.7269,0.3747,2020-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Plenty of American reviewers here saying this story doesn't make sense. Well it's losely based on the European myth of Krampus, a goatlike creature that punished children that had been bad.The story is quite good here, they all had lost the meaning of family and kindness and now get punished by Krampus.This isn't a horrorfilm, it's a seasonal comedy-horror and it works. The acting is quite alright. I watch this film every year around Christmas and it's still good."
" Good concept, but inconsistent production
",0.2382,-0.5709,2020-12-22 00:00:00,6,The story could have taken a darker tone and avoided the gimmicks and minions.Instead there was a comedic touch thrown in and the movie doesn't know which direction to take.Krampus should've been more horror and traditional in back story.
" Didn't work out all that enjoyably for me personally
",0.4215,0.8948,2020-12-21 00:00:00,6,"A mixed bag.'Krampus' has a lot of potential, based on the dark themes we see. However, unfortunately, it dumbs itself down in festive family gathering melodrama. I also didn't rate the ending that much, not that it's bad per se - it's just meh to me.Adam Scott is alright in the role of Tom, though is bettered by Toni Collette as Sarah; albeit minorly. The most interesting character is Krista Stadler's Omi, though they don't delve as deeply into her as I expected/wanted. Elsewhere, David Koechner's character, Howard, is kinda lame, but Koechner himself is solid. Of the younger actors, Emjay Anthony (Max) and Stefania LaVie Owen (Beth) are OK.It does do positive things. Some of the tension building is good, even if their eventual pay-offs are a little underwhelming. The antagonists look cool, especially the gingerbread men and the jack-in-the-box. It works Xmas music vibes into the score well, also.Nothing terrible, but it didn't work out all that enjoyably for me personally."
" Could be so much better
",0.4902,-0.701,2020-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Was really good until the attic scene. Then it went stupid. If they kept the dark horror of the first half, it would be brilliant.Just felt stupid and felt like studio bosses interfered"

Yeah I know it is.
That's the point.
Do you think they didn't know that when they were making it? They knew it was stupid. That's what makes it really kind of great.Come into this movie with no expectations, and you'll be really quite surprised. It's a lot of fun, it's very funny and it's got a nice Christmas warmth to it that you wouldn't expect. Yeah it's goofy, but that's the bloody point."
" A meandering journey to a terrific finish
",0.4767,0.7165,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Way too much exposition up front. Your extended family is a nightmare, thanks we get it. Take out 20 minutes. Krampus is coming to get you and he has creepy helpers. We get it. Take out 10 minutes. You're left with a solid hour of horror. And then keep a really imginative finish. So it's a good extended Twilight Zone episode.Anyway, an underrated film, generally. Worth a look, maybe a second look."
" Solid Christmas movie
",0.1531,0.8969,2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't sure this movie was going to be good or bad, but it ended up being a very solid movie. i enjoyed every bit of the fun fantasy of krampus"
" Don't confuse it with other 'Krampus' movies...
",0.1695,0.9583,2020-12-03 00:00:00,6,"There are sooooooo many films with 'Krampus' in the title, that it's easy to read a review for one somewhere, thinking it's for this.This is by far, the best 'Krampus' movie out there...and it stands head and shoulders above the rest.Better budget, better actors/acting, better cinematography, better sound, better CGI etc.All the others have this movie's poster on their bedroom walls!"
" Disappointing and uninspired
",-0.4939,0.5424,2020-11-02 00:00:00,4,"I really didn't enjoy this movie; it has the setup to be a great and entertaining movie but it dropped the ball.Apart from following a group of really unlikable people in the family, and their extended family at christmas time, this was incredibly boring.The effects and the monsters were alright looking, but the acting was lackluster and the music was generic over the top dramatic fare that really gets tired on the ears.In the end the fantasy they wove into the Krampus story was too illogical and distorted. The setup at the start of the film wasn't done well enough.4/10 below average flick that wasn't either scary or funny."
" Great Christmas alternative
",0.6249,0.1027,2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,Watched it with the family and we all enjoyed it. Not too explicit for the kids but scary and interesting enough for all.
" Simply atrocious
",0.0,-0.7071,2020-10-08 00:00:00,1,"Everything was completely and utterly horrible, from the acting to the chemistry between the characters. There was absolutely no comedy nor any horror. All the jump-scares were extremely predictable and the plot was simply way too dull. To consider this monstrosity a good movie means that you must be brain dead."
" Unrealistic
",0.0,0.6752,2020-09-26 00:00:00,4,This movie is good I guess but some very unrealistic things. Childish like things. Could be a children's PG movie without the violence. Too unrealistic though. Has a good twist. Bad ending.
" I love this movie
",0.6369,0.9778,2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I first saw this movie when it was released in theaters and didn't think too much of it. I thought it was entertaining but nothing super special. However, after purchasing the DVD for the sole purpose of adding it to my horror collection, I began watching it more and more and came to realize how much I actually enjoy it. For one, it's pretty funny. Plus, I find the story of Krampus very interesting, so it's fun to see it come to life on the big screen. It's a great watch for both Christmas and Halloween time. Also, the fact that Toni Collette is in it certainly doesn't hurt. What I like most about this movie is that it has substance and character. The story and development is definitely beyond surface-level and you're unlikely to find another movie like it. It's a refreshing watch. It was definitely better than other horror movies that were released around the same time (The Boy, The Forest, etc.)"
" I feel violated
",-0.5267,-0.9791,2020-09-22 00:00:00,2,"That was god awful. I didn't laugh or get scared once during the film, I just sat there in pure silence for an hour and a half. The story line made no sense and the kids acting was shocking. Bad acting, bad story line, bad film, BAD!"
" Not as bad as I expected...
",0.431,0.5307,2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Going into this movie, I did not have high hopes. I assumed the plot would be stupid and the characters would be one-sided. Boy, was I wrong. Not only did I end up liking most of the characters, but I found the acting to be exactly what it need to be: Funny at times and dramatic at times. The effects were not as good as I would have liked, but they get the job done. I found all the creatures to be a little cute but also a little terrifying, which is perfect. My only problem is you barely see Krampus himself. This was great for a PG-13 horror movie and I would watch it again."
" Ass kicked by a Christmas cookie
",-0.5423,0.8247,2020-07-13 00:00:00,9,"It would have been better if it were rated R, more gore and such. Some of the jokes are fair, the Krampus himself is very cool - much like Moskito on Frankenstein's army. Very cool but I wanted to see more of him - like all of him. The music was really good. Killer gingerbread cookies were neat, so were the killer toys. So, been better at R but we can't have everything."
" I think the title has an ""m"" too many...
",0.0,0.9451,2020-06-29 00:00:00,5,"This is the Christmas from hell - only it is oddly deserving on this rather horrid family. Young ""Max"" (Emjay Anthony) has gone all Ebenezer on us as his family spend most of the festive period time rowing with each other. All this negativity unleashes the eponymous monster bent on seeking out the santa-phobes amongst us! Woe betide anyone who crosses them; they can possess anything from an huge great snowplough to a gingerbread cookie and they are relentless in their pursuit of the miserable. It could have been quite good fun, but the cast really do deserve their comeuppance (except, maybe, ""Omi"" (Krista Stadler) who has the wisdom of her years). The acting is as wooden as the contrived drama created by their noisy intolerance of each other. The effects are actually quite a laugh now and again, but there are just too many ""Babes in the Wood"" moments to keep this interesting after the first 20 minutes. Sorry...."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.9379,2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Krampus is a great movie with lots of jump scares and twists, Toni Collette is very convincing and enjoyable to watch. There is humour which is a great addition but the ending is slightly strange however it's a good twist. This is good to watch together with children 15 and older and isn't gory or sexual for any younger audiences."
" Next GREAT HORROR CHRISTMAS Movie Classic...
",0.1027,0.9896,2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"KRAMPUS took a few views for me to start to like/appreciate it. I think this is one of those movies that need a few (maybe 5 - 10 years) to be fully appreciated. I thought it was lousy/terrible on first viewing, but by the year 2020 I have come to appreciate it a lot more. Despite the poor writing the tone is pretty cool, and most of the Special Creature/Gore FX pretty are well done. IDKY but I have grown to like this movie over time. PLUS, also IMHO Conchata Ferrell is an awesome character actress (i.e. Two and Half Men)"
" A fun, creative, and well-made modern-day Christmas fairytale.
",0.7351,0.9868,2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie on Christmas Eve of last year to get me into the Christmas spirit (I wrote this review a while ago). While the movie isn't joyful, it till manages to make you feel like you're actually watching a Christmas movie. The movie is a horror, though it will likely only manage to scare children. Still, the costume design is fantastic - the creatures here are comparable to those in Pan's Labyrinth (2006).I have to say, I was a little worried as the movie got closer to the end. Honestly, I was afraid they'd go with an obvious and clichéd happy ending where the whole family gets to come back and it's all as if nothing ever happened. The movie
does end this way, but not exactly as I had pictured it. Instead the camera falls back to reveal that the family, who is now alive and enjoying their Christmas as they should be, is stuck inside a snow globe within Krampus' cave, presumably so that they can relive Christmas over and over as a family - a twisted version of the protagonist's wish. This unexpected ending provides a nice twist that turns a cliché into a nice little fairy tale ending, well suited for this Christmas story.I would absolutely recommend this movie if they're looking for a fun time around the holiday season."
" Fun, dark Christmas romp is callback to 80s.
",0.5106,0.9774,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I'll just say this right now: to enjoy this movie you need to go in with the right mindset. If you're expecting straight-up horror that will make it hard to fall asleep at night, this is not the film for you. However, if you're expecting dark comedy than you will most likely enjoy this film. It's obvious it was influenced by ""Gremlins"" and ""Poltergeist"" in some parts. Without giving too much away, I will say that if you were a child of the '80's you will definitely be reminiscing about those movies. That's not to say it's a straight ripoff of them, though. It's definitely got some originality to it. If you're a ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" fan, you'll probably enjoy ""Krampus."" There's even a flashback sequence entirely animated in stop-motion and it's beautifully done. Even during the parts that are supposed to be scary, it's so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard to take those parts seriously. That's not a complaint. I enjoyed that. I was smiling and laughing nearly the whole time. Even the score takes classic Christmas music and gives it a dark, warped feeling. You will never be able to hear ""Carol of the Bells"" the same way again. So, if you're tired of the cliche ""we love each other"" saccharine sweet Christmas films and you're looking for something different, this is the film for you. I have a feeling that in about 10-20 years this will be considered a classic like ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Elf,"" Nightmare Before Christmas"" and of course ""Gremlins.""Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

" The 2nd Yearly Tradition Holiday Horror from Michael Dougherty
",-0.25,0.9984,2019-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Ever since seeing it on the big screen for the first time, ""Krampus"" has become a yearly tradition for me, as much as the other Michael Dougherty's seasonal horror ""Trick'r'Treat"" & I would love him to do a sequel to one or the other. ""Krampus"" is far from flawless, but it's a wildly entertaining, thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing holiday horror flick.I feel like ""Krampus"" took a lot of risks, which I very much appreciate, but, somehow, stayed a little too conventional at the same time. ""Krampus"" has a dark heart that I absolutely love, Michael Dougherty takes the sweet, perfectionist essence of Christmas and throws it into a blender with the harsh reality of a modern family and the not-all-that-nice vibes surrounding this holiday in the same modern times. The story is carried on by an awesome cast delivering grounded and charming performances, a well befitting atmosphere, and, of course, awesome cinematography, even more awesome FX (including lots of practical effects) and great action sequences. The production design is spot on, really, Krampus himself is just pure and simply nailed. ""Krampus"" does its job well both as a horror and a comedy - the suspense building is as good as the pay-off & some of the jokes are actually funny. I find that the biggest of flaws is the pacing - it suffers a bit during the middle parts. After having seen it five times, I think there could've been a little more action scattered through. The third act delivers a truly fun load of action though, never disappoints me. To top it all off, the ending's much more ominous than happy, that's another +1 from me.""Krampus"" is equal parts dark and funny - a highly entertaining Christmas horror romp for pretty much the whole family. I'll keep the tradition going & still hope for Michael Dougherty to return to the genre of horror and comedy, because the latest ""Godzilla"" is not what he does best... My rating: 8/10."
" The Real Bad Santa
",-0.5423,-0.9551,2019-12-20 00:00:00,6,"I've abstained from reviewing Krampus since I first saw it in the cinema four years ago as I could never figure out what the movie's problems and strengths were, but after seeing the movie five times now and feeling the same frustrations over and over I think I've got it sussed.Krampus is best described as a combination of Christmas Vacation and Gremlins, opening with a satire of mindless Yuletide consumerism before settling in with a middle-class family in the suburbs including German grandma, emotionally distant teen daughter, and idealistic son. Their cheer is soon ruined by the arrival of extended family who bring trashy, redneck values that are at odds with the atmosphere of the household. After mocking the poor son's belief in Santa Claus and his desire for a wholesome family Christmas he decides not to mail his letter to the big man and rips it up, surrendering the shreds to the winter wind.Someone else is the recipient of that letter. Someone darker and malevolent.A darkness falls over the neighborhood, town, and world, isolating our disparate gang from any outside saviors while a host of nasty creatures invade their safe space, offing them one by one, and it's at this point the movie begins to come apart as the pacing and structure becomes far too chaotic and annoying. A clever kill every ten minutes with clearly defined rules and building mystery would have resulted in a far better movie, but Michael Dougherty fumbles this all-important middle act, leaving the audience desperate and impatient for a quick ending.The practical effects in this movie are also quite, quite appalling, especially the actual Krampus creature, which barely has any points of articulation. Even the 1987 Garbage Pail Kids looked better than this. Exactly what are his minions supposed to be? What are the rules here? Some wonderfully devilish elves appear but nothing is done with them and they disappear just as fast. The fight against the demonic toys in the attic is terribly done, with nothing clearly shot, and also confusingly intercut with a ridiculous gingerbread man fight in the kitchen. The cutting back and forth between these events neuters both to the point of irrelevance.In its favor, Krampus has surprisingly good characterisation, an immense amount of atmosphere and a cold, otherworldly feel that really helps sell this as a dark Christmas alternative. So many movies aim to be the new Christmas classic and become an annual tradition but the majority of them fail. Krampus barely makes the grade. This could/should have been a much better movie and I can understand why less patient viewers would dislike it."
" Not funny and not scary
",0.0572,0.1771,2019-12-17 00:00:00,2,"Wow the jokes and scares fall flat in this. I saw Rate Exports first and it wasn't that great either. Good intention, interesting story idea. But both of these movies are duds. Neither can decide if they want to be fables for kids or dark comedies for grown ups. So they languish in indecision throughout their meandering storylines. We have yet to have a really good Christmas horror film. But at the rate we're going the entire Krampus theme will be worn out by the time we get there."

You've got to take it for what it is - it's a campy horror-comedy with a really solid cast and some pretty fun scares, nothing more and nothing less. This is what I would consider to be a ""family-friendly"" horror movie, almost like this year's Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. There really aren't too many horror movies entirely themed around Christmas, so this is a nice change from the typical warm and fuzzy movies playing this time of year. If you're on the fence, I'd definitely give it a go!"

'Krampus' is a comedy-horror film directed by Michael Dougherty. It is based on the eponymous character from Austro-Bavarian folklore.
I seen this movie when it first came out and I was so happy to have a Christmas themed horror film that was actually good.
When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max (Emjay Anthony) is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know; this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive.
The acting is surprisingly strong. Adam Scott as the classic overworking father, Toni Collette as the anguish wife and David Koechner as the overbearing mean spirited uncle who provide great conflict in a dysfunctional nightmare at each other. Even the child performances not once cringe me at all!
The story is simple but executed in a way that is so entertaining it makes you want to watch it again and again. The comedy doesn't always hit and makes tense scenes seem awkward rather than have added humor. But the movie is very tense at times and while it is lacking in humor, its all entertaining.
Overall, the movie is a Christmas film with a horror twist and if you're into that, give this a try. It has a great cast and above all a great and simple story.

OH MY, IT WAS OR IS THE WORST CHRISTMAS FILM THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.
It is HORRIBLE it is not FUNNY, SCARY, IT IS PRETTY BORING I FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
Acting in this film was also really bad. They even looked BORED.
I just found this Film a waste of MONEY and one of the first films in years I couldn't even talk to. With Friends like saying Oh buddy you must GO SEE THIS FILM. ""NOT""

Tonight I thought ""Perhaps I was in a bad mood."" And decided that I would give it another chance. The actors did a decent job with what little they were given, but I'm pretty sure that none of them were proud of the end result. If there were one positive thing to say about it, it's that at least there wasn't a dubbed in laugh track."

",0.0,-0.9878,2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. terrible on multiple levels. not even a tiny bit scary. I didn't like any of the characters. some of the directing was horrendous. confusing shaky-cam strobe light effects that hurt my eyes were used for half the movie. Which also made no sense because it was supposed to be lightning but was constantly strobe-ing. one of many things in this movie that made ZERO sense. everything was so dumb. I forced myself to finish as it got worse and worse. stuckmann sometimes I think you're crazy (1 viewing)
" Best krampus movie

I also like the twist at the end .Overall , the movie is really good and i like the idea about evil santa and how he fullfils the whishes of the ones who lost hope in their life and asked for some bad thing but he also teaches them a lesson and left them regret for their whole lives.The vfx , cgi and sfx here are really good everything looks real. The set design and environment is also creepy .At the start there is a sarcastic song playing in the background which shows the reality of Christmas now these days.Overall i would say it is a good horror movie and u can give it a watch."
" Fun Christmas Horror
",-0.1027,0.999,2019-03-14 00:00:00,8,"This was a film that I heard a lot about and had never gotten around to see it. Many of the podcasts I listen to always talked about how this is now in their Christmas horror film rotation. I decided this year to give it a try and get into the spirit myself. The official synopsis for this film is a boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a festive demon to his family home.We kick this film off what looks to be either Black Friday or people doing last minute Christmas shopping. Regardless, it shows one of things that I hate most about the Christmas holiday, how commercial it has become.The film then shifts to a family returning home. Our main character is Max (Emjay Anthony). He is actually being scolded by his parents, Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette). He got in a fight during a Christmas play. It turns out that Max still believes in Santa Claus despite his age. His grandmother, known as Omi (Krista Stadler) tries to cheer him up and tells him to write to Santa.This family is being joined by their cousins, aunts and uncle. Max has a sister, Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen). His uncle is Howard (David Koechner). His wife is Linda (Allison Tolman). They have four children, Howie, Jr. (Maverick Flack), Jordan (Queenie Samuel) and Stevie (Lolo Owen). The interesting thing about the last two is they are girls, but the father really wanted boys. They also have a baby. Their Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). No one is thrilled about her as she complains about everything and drinks a lot.During dinner, the two girls get the letter that Max wrote and start to read it. He is embarrassed and wishes that Christmas would go back to the way it used to be. He then throws the ripped up letter out of the window. We then see that it goes into the sky.The following morning, there is a horrible snowstorm and they can't see even across the street. The power and heat are off as well. Max notices a snowman outside that wasn't there before. Beth asks to go see her boyfriend, but when she doesn't return home, Tom and Howard go looking for her. They find something sinister that is stalking them as everyone on the street seems to be missing.I do want to lead off stating that this film is fun. If you haven't gathered, I'm not the biggest fan of Christmas, but something about this film I really liked. The concept of Krampus is something I find to be absolutely fascinating. Many of us grew up with Santa Claus and we had to be good in order to get presents. It is terrifying that if you are bad, there is an evil version that will come to take you away.What I find interesting about this film is that Krampus uses evil toys and elves as his minions. This gave me vibes of A Nightmare Before Christmas even though their toys unintentionally do bad things, because that is just how things were done in Halloweentown. The minions in this film are quite creative I have to say.Something that really turned me off to this film before seeing it was there being a lot of comedic actors. At the time this film came out, I wasn't the biggest fan of horror comedies. It is something that I have started to come around to, even though the crossover still isn't my favorite. I have to say, I was wrong, because the cast definitely enhances this film, not ruin it.Tthe pacing of the film is very well done. What I like about this film is that it does have lighter feel throughout, but it does get dark. There are some laughs that are sprinkled in, which is something I like if you are going to have comedy. This film does feel like a horror film for sure. There was a moment in it where I was going to get real angry if they decided to end a certain way. It ended up going the way I hoped it would, which is actually something I had heard on a podcast prior to watching this. It is funny to have the same reaction to this.Acting for this film I thought was great. Anthony is interesting as he is the main character, but he falls into the background for a good portion. A lot of that is he is a kid and the parents are trying to do what they can to protect them. Scott and Koechner are interesting as they are the exact opposite of each other. You have Scott who is more left in his ideology with Koechner being right wing. They end up coming to common ground to work together which I thought was good. Collette is solid as usual. I really like Stadler as the wise older person who give the background of what is happening. Owen doesn't have a big role, but I found her to quite cute. Ferrell was good for comedic relief and the rest of the cast round it out well for what they needed.Something else I found to be really good were the effects. I'm assuming there was a combination of practical and CGI, but they were done seamlessly for the most part. The look of Krampus himself was great. What I found interesting is we never get to see his face, as he is wearing a Santa mask. I was completely fine with this. The elves also looked good, as their masks were creepy as well. The toys were much of the same. The only thing I had an issue with is the living ginger bread men. They were a little bit too out there for my liking. This film was shot beautifully though and I liked the effect of the storm to really make the film much more claustrophobic.Now with that said, I thought this film was good and I'm kicking myself for not seeing it earlier. I love the concept of Krampus. It is even more interesting the minions that he brought along with him. It is an interesting perversion of Santa. I really only had issue with the living cookies from his group. The acting I thought was really good as were the effects. The editing and pacing were solid with a good ending. If you are a fan of the holidays and want to see a horror film that fits the spirit, I would recommend this one. I found this to be good."
" Underappreciated cult classic which surely has to become a yearly tradition
",0.4404,0.9391,2019-01-31 00:00:00,8,"When families are forced to spend time together in close proximity at Christmas things often go wrong. People argue and tempers fray. Imagine then, if a Bavarian Christmas demon attacks your neighbourhood because he has been summoned due to the gloom emanating from your family.Michael Dougherty directs this 2015 comedy, fantasy, horror film which is destined to live on yearly as a Christmas film for late night viewing. Featuring a great cast and some really authentic horror action this film has been under-valued due to the Christmas film it is decorated with. It reminds me of a good old fashioned 80's and 90's horror film - think ""Gremlins"", ""Evil Dead"", and ""Tales from the Crypt"" - even away from horror, there were times it felt like this was all happening on the same street as ""Home Alone"" was unfolding.I expected this film to be a b-movie 'bad but good' film which was entertaining enough for me to like it - this surpassed that and I actually loved this film. The action was great, the practical effects were top notch, the spare CGI worked really well, the plot and script were convincing too. While labelled as a horror film, you don't get the cliché horror that you'd see in modern films, no overuse of fake blood and gore, no over the top R-rated violence and language, no scares just for the sake of making the audience jump. Instead this is a well crafter family horror, if there is such a film - something I'd be happy watching with my retired parents, or with some of my older nephews. It's actually a refreshing change to see this level of care applied to a film - but admittedly, this might not make everyone as happy as it did me. For me this really did feel like a family horror film with all the heart and messages of a good Christmas film too.I'm giving this film 8 out of 10. I am more than positive that this will be watched every Christmas hence forth. Enjoy!"
" not all that successful
",-0.4717,0.826,2019-01-06 00:00:00,3,"I've got to admit that I find it hard to think of a target audience, since the movie is too scary and intense for children and too silly and predictable for older teenagers and adults. (If you're over 13 or 14 and if you're unable to predict the ending, or at least the general tone and message of the ending, feel free never to become an astronaut.)The movie is also much given to preaching, even when this is clearly inappropriate, as in the tale told by ""Omi"", the German grandmother. The tale is a short but accurate description of a community in ruins, probably as a result of war. Can you believe that there exist traumatized, malnourished, defeated humans who have given up hope ? And can you believe that there exist bone-tired children driven to distraction by the constant quarrelling of their parents ? Boo to all of these spoilsports ! Boo ! They should all be singing carols next to a roaring fireplace !Still, I would like to congratulate the people who designed and executed the various monsters. Many of these monsters were genuinely funny, disquieting or original, such as the malevolent gingerbread men. I get the feeling that these creations would do very well in, say, animation shorts about fairytales."
" Quick Review
",0.0,0.9598,2019-01-03 00:00:00,5,"""Krampus""'s real problem is only its tone. I understand that they tried to get a family-horror style to it, but in the end its very clearly just one of those. When its a family scene it is just that and the same goes for horror too.If you can get past it, you will have a movie full of good performances (especially Toni's one), great end and some pretty creepy monsters.Not recommended for a family viewing, but you can watch it with your friends during Christmas period."

" Enjoyable horror for Xmas
",-0.2023,0.9127,2018-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Krampus. The shadow of Santa Claus. The punisher of naughty children. One Christmas a somewhat disfunctional American family have their lives ruined when a young boy summons him by accident. Many Christmas horror movies are slashers so Krampus makes a good alternative. This is a good combination of horror, fantasy and comedy. It certainly starts off with the emphasis on humour but becomes darker as it progresses. Although much of the cast is comprised of young kids I think it would be unsuitable for pre teen children. There are a few good jump moments plus plenty of on screen violence. A bit of swearing too. Credit to David Koechner and Conchata Ferrell, great performances delivering much of the humour. Toys coming to life reminded me of some horror movies from the 80's/early 90's. Trouble I found here is that much action takes place in the loft and there was too much going on in a confined space. Without giving it away there was a good twist at the end. I certainly would not call Krampus a classic Festive horror movie but it is better than many others, I enjoyed it."

",0.5106,-0.9479,2018-12-23 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie in December 2015 - when first released. I wasn't in the right frame of mind, or watching it properly, so I rewatched it in December 2018 with fresh eyes. A lot of what I thought that first time rang true again!Still... a movie that makes you want to see it again has to mean something...The negatives of consumer culture at Christmas are shown from the get-go via the opening credits, and this sets the tone for the remainder of the movie.Great effort is made to establish the characters, but in hindsight, they aren't particularly likeable. Which I suppose makes the reason for Krampus' visit even more necessary.The problem with spending so much developing the characters/situation (ok... we get the idea... extended family at Christmas can be a burden... NEXT!), we aren't really giving an onslaught of terror/horror until the one hour mark which feels somewhat delayed.The CGI gingerbread men take away from the creepiness and 'what isn't seen is scarier' vibe earlier. In face, speaking of earlier... the scene in which Beth's father and Howard search for the daughter conveys the vibe of what the horror SHOULD have remained - a silouetted Krampus on chimneys of neighbourhood houses... hoof prints... The moment we ""see the monster"", all anticipated shocks are erased and we aren't left with any mystery.I believe KRAMPUS never screened in Australia - or if it did, screenings were limited. It even had a trailer release in mid 2015 but nothing was ever heard again. The reason would be the ending, I suppose. The blatant 'f*&k you' to the holiday season and any grinches out there... but the snow globe finale poses a poignant question... what happens is we DO stop believing in the spirit of Christmas?"

You watch it and liken it to other Christmas movies where the protagonist learns a lesson and earns happiness. If you expect that here then you missed the point, he come stop punish. When Krampus was called, their fate was set. This is not a feel-good family holiday movie where everything comes out hunky dory. This movie should have done much better but it was up against the two biggest movies of the year, Star wars and Mockingly 2, so it didn't have a chance. For those who did see it, I hope they enjoyed the reality (vs false happiness) of other holiday tales, and enjoyed the ""it doesn't turn out alright"" ending."

Or is he more like the God of the Old Testament who uses whatever means necessary to horrify so that people are given the opportunity to turn back from their wayward lives. The latter is my interpretation. This film is for Horror buffs what A Christmas Story is for Childhood Drama buffs. I happen to be a buff of both genres, and love it when they are combined as with this instant classic. I ordered a copy, and can't wait until my postman brings it for Christmas!*Some profanity

" Poor writing
",-0.4767,-0.9919,2018-10-07 00:00:00,2,"Based on the reviews I was prepared to see sophisticated horror but got an aimless ninety minutes of mostly boredom. Here are the main issues I have with this film:1) Daughter is missing, mom calmly goes about her normal routine. Any mother in the world would be climbing the walls with worry.2) Son gets yanked up the chimney, dad doesn't seem too put out by it. If this happened in real life, the whole family would be upset, screaming, terrified, instead they just return to their normal routine. The film takes great pains to set us in reality, then expects the viewer to accept the characters' calm reactions to missing family members. Either go full on horror or broad comedy or something, but make it believable.3) Grandma says keep the fire burning, she's right there in the living room, why can't she keep it burning? 4) The backstory makes ZERO SENSE. She's given a loaf of bread that people take from her, why would they take her bread? It's a major city, of course they would have bread for everyone already. If they're too poor to afford bread, they can't afford Christmas anyway, so why would krampus come because they're poor? Someone didn't think these things through while they were writing the story.5) The characters have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The main kid is too old to believe in Santa Claus. The visiting family are painted with broad brush strokes, too obnoxious to be taken seriously, in a film that asks you to suspend disbelief and then is too lazy to write believable characters. The fat aunt marches into the kitchen and criticizes mom's cooking, NO ONE WOULD DO THAT. A talented writer with a lighter touch could have handled that scene with aplomb.I had been looking forward to seeing this film for some time and was greatly disappointed."

I must say that I find the concept of an anti-Santa Claus is beyond creative and attractive.Needless to say I wasn't expecting much when I heard that hollywood was making a movie about such a rich legend, I was expecting an average teen horror relying on jumpscares. but then I saw the director Mr. Michael Dougharty and my expectations where hyped. I really loved Trick'r Treat and it's tongue in cheek horror, and let me tell you that's exactly what this legend needeed.
First let's talk about just how beautiful the monsters of this movie are, yes, because the Krampus is just the icing on the cake for all the horror this movie has stored for us. There is a really clever use of puppetry and customes in this movie in a level that honestly caught me off guard. There's only one monster in particular that you'd notice is CGI, but then I'd ask you... how else would've you made it? all this is paired with really creepy imagery that manages to mantain an atmosphere that reminded me of the best parts of The Shining.On the other hand, this movie dares to bring us a serious scolding about the true meaning of christmas, and when I'm saying this, I'm not talking about family or love, I'm talking about greed, hypocrisy, material obssesion, looks and all that makes Christmas a really bad time for some people, if you're willing to take this message as it comes, you'll be satisfied, safe to say this is not a ""feel-good movie"".Watch it on Christmas, hug your family, lock the doors, because Krampus is coming."

I've seen this a couple of times by now, and I do feel like Dougherty explored new-ground here - tonally, as well as with the practice of genre bending, and also with just downright getting away with pushing the limits of the concept of PG-13.Also, Dougherty's images are really divine .. he and cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin really seem to dig deep to get these trippy, gorgeous, expressionistic, non-CGI-looking images of wintry madness just right - and they do .. this is the type of film that people expect to be expressionistic and 'romanticized'; it is the type of picture that people walk into really craving submersion into novelty - the depths of winter-blackness being the 'novelty' in this case - and, here, they are fully granted that glowing, campfire-story-feeling through the cinematography, which never lacks in terms of grandiosity and hallucinatory vividness ... ... ... and, furthermore .. this is the type of film that needs the cast to be just right; people actually n e e d the character-archetypes and character-stereotypes for this level of novelty .. but, anyway, Dougherty made the perfect decisions with all the adult-leads: Toni Collette, Adam Scott, David Koechner and Conchata Ferrell really do come together to make things gel - to make the jokes gel, and to make the drama work; everything feels constructed with this film - in a good, solid way, though - and the lead performances feel like that, too - like tightly constructed, and a little stiff in a good way, and really satisfying .. and the kids they got are great and believable .. the performances just really click, I think.8 out of 10 stars"

Unfortunately, though, the film later blends comedy elements with horror, and it doesn't blend that well due to the dark nature of the film. It can't decide if it wants to be a horror or a horror comedy, and the mix doesn't work. This would have been so amazing as a full-on horror, but it gets very weird, and is not serious enough when it ought to be. The effects remain amazing, though. I found Toni Collette way too good an actress for this type of film. I did like the unpredictability of the film."

Tom Engel (Adama Scott) and family are hosting some relatives for the holiday season, people they seem to tolerate only because they are family.

Young Max Engel (Emjay Anthony) has a special relationship with his German grandmother (Krista Stadler) who believes in Santa. When Max is bullied...the spirit of things change.It took me a while to see this film because of the plethora of Krampus films on the market. This one is ""kid friendly"" in that there are no F-words, sex, nudity, or gross bloody scenes. I don't see it as an annual classic as it is a film one can out grow. The production had a ""Gremlins"" feel to it as small characters provide us with mischief. The film lacks real horror for adults. Fair amount of humor."
" Better watch out, better not cry, better not pout but you're all gonna die.
",-0.1835,0.9905,2018-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Throughout this Christmas season, I've wanted to see a horror film from 2015 called ""Krampus"", directed by Michael Dougherty (""Trick 'r Treat""), and now I finally watched it. Having heard of the praise this movie got, I was interested as to why. Needless to say, I got my answer. For those who don't know, Krampus is from the actual Santa Claus folklore: while Santa rewards those who have been good, Krampus punishes those who have not. It was made in the style of classic 80s horror such as ""Poltergeist"" and ""Gremlins"", complete with some of the most impressive practical effects I've seen in a while (hardly any CGI was used), while also subverting some of the usual trappings of that era, which I commend. Plot: All little Max wanted was to celebrate Christmas with his family like they used to, but most of the folks have become increasingly dysfunctional to the point where it's unbearable. Disillusioned, he turns his back on the holiday, which summons the nefarious Krampus and his minions to their doorstep. Now, they struggle to survive this not-so-jolly onslaught while also learning what it truly means to be a family. While I personally wasn't scared, there are plenty of things in ""Krampus"" that were effectively disturbing with mild comedy. The titular antagonist is a truly fantastical nightmare, sporting a beautifully twisted design and unnerving presence, a perfect antithesis of ol' St. Nick. The little minions are both varied and creepy in each of their own ways, taking all the things we typically associate with the holiday and turning them upside down. The atmosphere and environment offer the appropriate chilling (pun intended) feeling of isolation this kind of story warrants. Surprisingly, I found myself emotionally invested in most of the family. You see how they've fallen apart yet you get shreds of who they used to be and want to see that side of them brought to the forefront. It's kind of like ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""Home Alone"" in that respect. The most pure, and personally interesting, of them are Max and his grandmother Omi. As of yet, I can hardly think of anything major to criticize with this film. It's definitely earned its place in the world of cinema and the director is already making it big (currently directing ""Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters""). If you want something refreshing to see next Christmas, then I'd say give ""Krampus"" a try."

Basically after a kid proclaims he wishes there was no Christmas he throws his Christmas List into the cold winter sky, embracing a storm. After a series of events they realize a figure from mythology, Krampus, comes to haunt them, showing the terror of Santa's twin's wrath on camera.
This film should really be a cult classic and should be as well known as Jeepers Creepers or maybe even Insidious.
What brought me down was somewhat of a lack of action with occasional jokes every now and then and maybe a momentary jump scare that isn't surprising.

" O-oh, the monsters in the attic are frightful!
",-0.5562,0.9707,2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I must admit that I originally hadn't planned to ever watch ""Krampus"", due to the assumption that it was more of a dark Christmas tale for children (like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" or ""Gremlins""), but then it suddenly became my ""annual Christmas horror back-up plan""! For you see, I have this stupid but inescapable tradition of watching at least one Christmas-themed horror movie per year and I still hadn't found a suitable title around new year's! Since I've already seen all the classics and couldn't get my hand on the ones that I initially planned to see (either ""Better Watch Out"" or ""All Through the House""), I purchased a copy of ""Krampus"" that was on promo-sale at my local supermarket. And I must say that I'm very glad it turned out this way, as this is seriously one of the biggest pleasant surprises I encountered in years! ""Krampus"" is child-friendly but not childish, and it contains far more suspense, creepy imagery and grisly monsters than I've seen in any other horror film lately. The opening sequences are downright fantastic: to the tunes of a golden oldie Bing Crosby carol, we see a compilation of less joyful holiday sights like crowded supermarkets with people fighting over presents and little kids crying on Santa's lap. It's a nice change from all the usual and fake merry scenes in movies and immediately sets the tone for a different kind of Christmas story. The film further unfolds like an old-fashioned folklore/fairy-tale, with young Max tearing up his letter to Santa Clause and cursing Christmas because his family is fighting at the diner table. By doing so, however, Max summons an ancient creature from the Austrian mythology. Krampus, the evil shadow of Saint Nicolas, punishes the unbelievers of Christmas by covering the entire landscape in ice and unleashing his monstrous toy creatures. ""Krampus"" feels like a mixture between the comedy classic ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" (dysfunctional family spending the holiday period together) and the Dutch horror flick ""Sint"" (demolishing the image of children's heroes), and the result is a fast-paced, atmospheric and beautiful film. There's even a terrific animated flashback interlude, explaining the origins of Krampus and the grandmother's first encounter with him. A lot of time and effort was also put in special effects and monster designs. It takes a while before we get to see Krampus but, luckily, he has an army of creepy minions, like evil gingerbread men, elves and scary dolls. With the excellent ""Trick 'r Treat"", co-writer and director Michael Dougherty already showed his great potential and with ""Krampus"" he forever proved that he's a multi-talented storyteller.

" An old-fashioned Christmas monster story
",0.0,-0.646,2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"KRAMPUS is a high-spirited Christmas horror tale that's a lot more fun than most Christmas-themed horrors which seem to go down the predictable 'killer Santa Claus' route. This one has some of the style and verve of the fine Halloween anthology TRICK 'R TREAT, and, although not as good as that movie, it tends to be better than average overall. The small-scale story is a little like POLTERGEIST and GREMLINS and involves a festive family gathering which is invaded by a series of crazy monsters brought to life by the spirit of German folklore. The family members end up getting munched and attacked by sentient toys and Christmas decorations, and if it's all a little safe and PG-13, there's enough high-spirited mayhem and decent FX work to let you forget the simplicity and occasional silliness of the story."

Krampus takes a while to get into the swing of things, but once it does, it's non-stop fun, getting darker and darker as it goes on.Things start out light-hearted enough, with an amusing opening credits sequence that mocks the commercialism of Christmas, and the film continues in this manner up to the moment when disillusioned Santa fan Max (Emjay Anthony) tears up his letter to the jolly old man, an act that is as good as an invitation to Krampus and his helpers.From hereon-in, it's twisted entertainment, as the family (including their National Lampoon's Vacation-style relatives) are captured one-by-one by the horned, cloven-hoofed Krampus, a gang of wicked ginger-bread men, a massive jack-in-a-box, a terrible teddy, a creepy doll, and some nasty elves. Dougherty handles the action with skill, providing moderate scares and silliness in the vein of that other holiday comedy/horror classic, Gremlins.After a lot of enjoyable Chrimbo chaos, with Max's family all captured by Krampus, it looks as though Dougherty has run out of ideas with an 'it was all a dream' conclusion, but a final shot ensures us that all is not as it seems.While not quite in the same league as Gremlins (largely thanks to the slow start and a lack of Phoebe Cates), Krampus should provide those who struggle with seasonal cheer with a few ho-ho-hos and some memorable monster fun."

Luckily, Krampus (with tongue planted firmly in cheek) pulls it off. From the slow-mo opening of the horrors of holiday shopping to the twist at the end. The play on Christmas traditional expectations are on full display. What Daugherty did for Halloween he has now done for Christmas, and gives us a movie that, like its near cousin, descends into the wilderness of visual and dark comedic excess in order to deliver its players to a moral that, somehow, manages to be universal and thoughtful. The methods at which he goes to make the point will be at odds with what you anticipate when going to a movie about the good old holidays, but that's precisely what makes it so distinctive.Many will perhaps find the tone unsettling and imbalanced for the nature of this premise, but ""Krampus"" is much smarter than it lets on
This is everything that a holiday fable should be: brooding, cautious, dark, humorous and thoughtful."
" I did not expect too much and I pretty much got what I expected
",0.4939,-0.9486,2017-12-13 00:00:00,4,"""Krampus"" is an American 95-minute movie from 2015 and if you have heard the name Krampus before and remember the reference, then maybe you will know that here we have a combination of Christmas and horror, in which the scary component, however, is far more dominant than the harmonic component. The director is Michael Dougherty and he is also one of the many writers working on this one. The most known cast members here are certainly Oscar nominee Toni Collette and Adam Scott from Parks and Recreation. I cannot deny that I am not a fan of the latter at all, also in this film, but it needs to be said in his excuse that honestly the material he and most of the other cast members were given here is never that amazing at all. There are also several child performers in here, who are probably not known to many and for me personally, that also includes the kid at the center of the story. The character of Krampus was included in many other horror films already, but this has to be among his most famous inclusions, probably even the number one. We see him in all kinds of shapes and costumes here and my favorite was probably the harlequin skin if you may want to call it that.But besides that, I also felt sadly that most of the movie was really forgettable. The general idea about the summoning and the background story of the creature not only never had me on the edge of the seat, but never impressed me at all. It's pretty tough to find huge pros in here. I think the runtime was not (way) too long. The ending when it actually seems they kill the boy was bold and unexpected, but sadly they made up for that kind of quality quickly afterward by including a stupid ""oh it was all just a dream"" story line. I also did not find this one worth seeing from the Christmas film perspective. The only ones I'd really recommend it to are probably those who really really are into supernatural creature horror films although they probably have seen it anyway already. The ending indicates that there may be plans for a sequel (or prequel), but we will see about that. I am not sure if quality, critical reception and especially box office were successful enough for them to really go for it. All in all, my personal verdict here is rather on the negative side too. Gotta give this one a thumbs-down and it is clearly inferior to some recent fairly decent horror films I've seen in previous months. My suggestion is you watch something else as this one clearly tries to include effects (even animation in flashback sequences) to make up for story-telling deficits. It's not worth your time."

" Krampus - He's Here To Make A Point!
",0.0,0.9986,2017-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, have always been my favorite holidays. In addition to great food, and family time, it is also a time when filmophiles can guiltlessly gorge on a panoply of holiday films. Truthfully, not all holiday cinema is great, but Michael Dougherty's Krampus hits on all cylinders, beginning with the sentimental, passing on to humorously engaging, and carefully rising up to terrific horror. Dougherty's previous Halloween movie, Trick 'r Treat, had quickly become one of my favorite films, not only thematically, but because there was so much attention to detail. Krampus shares the same painstaking, beautifully filmed scenes so reminiscent of the late and wonderful writer/director John Hughes (Home Alone, Uncle Buck, Planes, Trains and Automobiles). And it is this very detailed focus that skillfully draws you into the film, locking you into the story and its various characters. Dougherty's vision of Krampus blends some of the darker Austrian and German supernatural fables with our more contemporary idea of a delightful Coca Cola Santa Claus. But Krampus isn't here to reward good children, indeed, he's arrived to punish the naughty ones. As in Trick 'r Treat, Dougherty has assembled a stellar cast, and an accomplished team to bring Krampus to life. And it is so much more than a ""slasher"" flick. Krampus glows in its own horrific nature, an embodiment of all that is good and bad when families get together to celebrate the holidays.To reveal anymore of this wonderful film would spoil the fun you'll have watching it for the first time. Rent the DVD or BR and enjoy the beautiful photography, the perfect cast, the great soundtrack, and above all, know that this is surely just the beginning of Michael Dougherty's amazing career as a filmmaker. Michael, if you're reading this, PLEASE don't make us wait too long for Trick 'r Treat 2, OK?"
" Blame the young for diminished ratings
",-0.34,-0.9622,2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was excellent (for sake of pure entertainment). The movie had excellent character design, and contained horror elements plus humor. Yes, there were stupid characters doing stupid things, but not as much as you see in other movies these days so what are you going to do. The movie deserves to be at least a 8 so I've bumped my score up to offset some of the younger audience, who was likely traumatized by this and came here to give the movie a 1. I read that many families took their young to see this movie (can't do anything to prevent the stupid these days) and because of that there were a bunch of kids who were traumatized and crying/shocked. I don't blame them! The character design was vivid and striking and surely would leave an impact for any young mind who envisions an endearing version of ""Santa"".So yea, the movie is about a 7.5 or so, the only thing I didn't like was how the antagonist ""Krampus"" was seemingly acting without real motive. What I mean by this, is his actions weren't to teach the ""kid a lesson"" about Christmas in a more violent way or anything, the demon was literally just there to kill and imprison everyone for no reason. I feel that this was perhaps one of the many alternate endings that the scriptwriting crew discussed while producing the movie, and they unfortunately went with this ending where I don't think it was the best. But everything else about the movie was great."
" National Lampoon's (horrific!) Christmas Vacation
",0.0,0.9828,2017-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes you know you're going to enjoy a film from the moment it starts. The opening to the horror film 'Krampus' is a montage of Christmas shoppers, all fighting and – practically – rioting as they try to snap up the best bargains for themselves. It was within these early minutes that the film made it clear that it didn't take itself seriously and didn't expect me to do either. In short: it was a tongue-in-cheek little number and wanted the world to know it.We meet our 'typical' family who are getting together for the holidays. And, I say 'typical' because, instead of all getting along perfectly, they (like us?) are basically just pretending to for the duration. However, the pretence finally snaps when the young boy has an outburst and storming off to his room. Rather than the only effects of this meaning he gets an hour less Xbox time, he inadvertently summons up an evil 'anti-Santa' demon known as 'Krampus,' who descends upon the family to drag them off to the underworld one by one. So, the family must fight for their survival (while also doing their best not to fight each other – at least some of the time!).As you can probably tell, I enjoyed the movie. It's not trying to be anything amazing, other than a darkly comic little caper with shades of horror and a dash of social commentary. And, despite it's 'PG13' rating robbing it of its gore, it is pretty dark. The monster itself is well done (looks like practical effects to me rather than CGI – always a bonus) and his minions amusing while being horrific at the same time (although I think the psychotic gingerbread men were CGI!). If you're into this sort of thing then you should be entertained for the duration. There are a few minuses – the little boy is a bit annoying, but luckily the adults (especially David Koechner!) make up for the child's inexperience. Plus the German grandma was put in there purely for purposes of explaining Krampus to the family (and us, the audience). Then there's a nice little mini animation in the middle of the film that sort of goes some way to explaining Krampus' origins. It's well done, but does seem a little out of place amidst the rest of the carnage.But those are only minor gripes. For some reason I found myself watching 'Krampus' on a boiling evening in mid June. I think it's better watched at Christmas. I think after a few long weeks of listening to Christmas songs and having to make sure everyone has enough presents to keep them from hating me for another year, I'll definitely watch this film again (and do my best not to wish Krampus on my extended family!)."
" Joy to the world..
",0.5859,0.8848,2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"From the director of the upcoming Godzilla film! This was on my must-watch-list ever since it came out and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Looking back, I wish I watched this instead of rewatching Star Wars. I had to watch Star Wars twice because I did not like it the first time around and wanted to see why seemingly everyone loved. Fast forward a couple of years and people finally realize Episode Seven was a fail. I'm half tempted to skip Episode Eight and wait for it to come out on cable. Anyway. This is a very fun and original horror film and it does an outstanding job of mixing both practical and computer based effects. And the director does a great job of mixing the horror and comedy. So yeah, I'm glad he is directing the next Godzilla movie. Before ending this I need to say one thing; this is sort of a one-shot type of movie. Any sequels or prequels made in an attempt to establish a franchise will simply cheapen this film and I hope it never happens."
" A fairy Tale Horror
",-0.5719,0.1896,2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,The movie should have been made decades early. The Germanic fairy tale of a creature that kills children who don't believe in Santa Claus has all the makings of a horror movie and this film does not disappoint. As someone who is not a fan of gratuitous violence this film is truly a great horror. It combines comedy with freakish sets and monsters. Yet somehow it is not fully a horror but a Christmas Classic for all those people who want to ditch Christmas and embrace the anti Christmas spirit well welcome to the world of the Krampus. The tale itself is frightening but i have to give a lot of credit to the designers of the props and sets in this film. The conclusion is also epic.
" Krampus Review
",0.0,0.4084,2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Anyone who goes into this movie disappointed by the end clearly didn't know what they were watching. I knew exactly what the movie was once I heard about it. So I wasn't disappointed. Stick around and see what I thought.Synopsis: When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non- believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive. Starring: Adam Scott, Toni Collette Director: Michael DoughertyThis movie was made as a comedy/horror from the jump. Notice which word I put first there. There is a reason I did that. The director made this movie in the right way.I never thought this was going to be an instant classic. It is one of those movies that could have a cult following in a few years, just like Dougherty last movie Trick 'r Treat.The movie is quite enjoyable. The major problem with the movie is the fact the studios wouldn't sign off on it unless it was rated PG- 13. This is one of those movies where the rating does hurt the movie more than it helped it. Yes, it did allow for a larger audience, but that is becoming a moot point. I saw parents taking their kids into Deadpool, and my misses saw moms taking their kids into Magic Mike.There is a lot of comedy in this movie. Not so much horror, but more comedy. There is even more action than horror in this movie. Of course, that is action towards evil objects.I want you to notice I didn't mention the acting. There is a reason for that. The movie wasn't about the acting. And the actors know that. They played their roles the right way as well.Final Thoughts: This movie was made an anti-Christmas movie. It doesn't matter when you watch, but you do need to watch it. It's not the best movie out there, but it's worth it.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks."
" I'm pretty sure someone paid people to give this thing good reviews
",0.8126,-0.9648,2017-02-28 00:00:00,1,"In my opinion, this is one of those movies that deserve a zero. I'm really puzzled by all those high ratings and the awards this movie got. For starters, there is not one single likable character in this movie. They are all either evil for no reason, disgustingly rude, or just plain out of touch... the decisions they make don't really make sense (if you watch it you'll know what I mean). I watched it because I had read some reviews that compared it to some horror classics from the 80's. But I mean, Gremlins had a plot, and some humor that actually worked. This movie tries to be funny and dark and just ends up with bad graphics of stuffed animals that... kill people? I don't know, sometimes movies are ""so bad they're good"" but this one just got stuck at bad. If you can, please watch something else."
" contrived, tedious, and unoriginal
",0.0,0.7675,2017-02-03 00:00:00,3,"Firstly I should say that none of the blame for this movie should be with the child actors here. They all did a good job, especially the kid in the main role. Hopefully he'll end up in something better than this in future.Krampus...Anyone saying this is a great film or proclaiming that it'll be a future cult movie needs to be slapped in the face with a wet turkey. This is an utterly run of the mill, clichéd attempt at a family-friendly 'horror', with cardboard characters (the adults that is, as I mentioned the kids are fairly believable) and hackneyed script and storyline. It gets very boring very quickly as you realise the film will never improve, and in fact gets drastically worse when the power goes out. Loads of screaming, wailing, and shouting with stuff whirling about, and snow. Some of the special FX are decent. That's it. This film has been made a million times before, and it will carry on being made."
" CGI ruins what could have been a wonderful movie
",0.2023,-0.1102,2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to like this movie. I love the theme, I love the set up, the family feels real, and there is fun and interesting villain. But they committed the cardinal sin of horror movie making; they overused CGI. After the first scare or two with CGI, I thought, okay they can't keep doing this the whole time right? Horror is all about suspension of disbelief. Well it's pretty much impossible to believe anything in this movie is actually happening, or could happen, because every time a monster\creature comes on screen it looks a video game character blue screened into the shot. It was flat out obnoxious. And then when you finally get to see Krampus, which isn't until the climax, he has the worst CGI face I have ever seen. It was so bad that I didn't even realize until a month or two later that he was supposedly wearing a mask, which frankly is just as bad. like I said, this movie could have been wonderful, it was entertaining to point, but when the cinematography looks like 2015 and the CGI looks like 1991, the movie feels completely disjointed. And if you think that CGI can only go so far, just look back to what they did with the first Jurassic park, back in the early to mid 90's. If they can pull off dinosaurs 20 years ago, then can we please make a monster look even somewhat realistic; or better yet, just get rid of CGI and go back to practical effects. John Carpenters remake of the Thing had amazing effects that looked real and scary, and that was what 1981? Watch this movie while playing on you cell phone, you will be far more entertained that way"
" Average Storytelling, Not Much Else
",0.0,0.9966,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Dark comedies are my go getter. Won't shy away from them. Took awhile to watch it but finally got around to it. And in the end it was just an average/decent film. I feel like they could have had a grand slam movie but it ended up short. By the end I had to give it a 6/10 for it had good elements to the movie but could have been so much more. It was sort of a bland movie were you forget you're watching a dark comedy/horror. And kind of just go along with the story. A Christmas/creature feature flick that is neither scary or laughable. Basically what it comes down too. For the Christmas part of it I think it did an excellent job of that. Especially adding the Christmas music when it got intense or the family bonding moments. But don't expect it to be a family Christmas movie now. Even when it had the Christmas feel, family trouble, music, and all other things you'll expect to see. You start to wonder if you turned on National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989). But then we get the folklore of Krampus.Krampus, an evil Santa. Or justice to families who just don't have the Christmas spirit. Very incredible job and special effects on Krampus himself. From the sound effects making him sound pretty epic to the way he moves about and looks. I was quite impressed. He sure does give you an extra chill run down your spine upon watching him. That is were the good sort of ends. I was expecting some comedy, cool side creatures, action, or nail biting moments, and scares! But you don't get anything like that. It had moments that were suppose to be just that, then fell flat. Some of the other creatures were cool (mainly just one) the others lame. The jokes/puns and action sort of felt eh. And of course the cliché grandma knows the back story of the so called Krampus. Which at least seems to be understandable, but left me with a few questions. I was expecting all sorts of exciting moments but not having any of it hit a home run for me. I was dreading the ending. The typical horror ending you always get. BAD! Although the ending came and I didn't hate. It felt fine. Like it belonged to a movie of this nature. It was cheesy and it seemed like it was going to end where the viewers weren't going to be satisfied. The very last minutes I think filled that spot. Not good enough to leave pleased but accept it.So from the beginning and jump to the end. That should have been the movie, a short story perhaps. The middle could have done without and would've been much better. In conclusion with it being a 6/10, average to me, only check this movie out during the Christmas time if you feeling sort of Christmas like or horror(truly not scary.) Otherwise it isn't a movie I would recommend to people's viewing. Not a must see and in a way feels a below average thanks to bland and unfunny jokes."
" Krampus
",0.0,-0.9933,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I heard a little bit about this dark Christmas film, and I saw the poster with the clawed hand holding a snow globe, and when I heard more about it I certainly became more intrigued to try it. Basically a dysfunctional suburban family are gathering for Christmas - Tom (Piranha's Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette), their children Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) and Max (Emjay Anthony); Sarah's sister Linda (Fargo's Allison Tolman), Linda's husband Howard (Final Destination 5's David Koechner), their children Stevie (Lolo Owen), Jordan (Queenie Samuel), Howie Jr. (Maverick Flack), and their baby daughter; Sarah and Linda's aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell); and Tom's German-speaking mother Omi (Krista Stadler). Following family tensions, Max rips up his letter for Santa Claus and throws it out the window, little does he know that this lack of Christmas spirit has unleashed the wrath of something nasty. The family find themselves trapped, snowed in by a severe blizzard, and the power cut out throughout the town. Beth is the first to disappear, worried about her boyfriend she walks to his house, but is caught in the storm, and finds herself stalked by a mysterious horned creature. Tom and Howard go out searching for Beth, going to the boyfriend's house, but they find it in devastation, with the chimney ripped apart, and giant hoof prints, going back outside Howard is attacked by something hiding in the snow, but Tom saves him. Returning to the house, not knowing what they are up against and panicking, they board up the doors and windows, but during the night the fire dies out, and a hook is lowered down the chimney, on it is a gingerbread man, it comes to life, and Howie is taken up and cannot be saved. Omi knows what is happening, they are being tormented by the Krampus (Luke Hawker, voiced by Gideon Emery), an ancient demonic spirit that punishes those who lose their Christmas spirit, the creature is referred to as the ""shadow of Saint Nicholas"", Omi herself was tortured by the Krampus as a child, her family and other townspeople were dragged to Hell, only she was spared. There are strange noises coming from the attic, the family go to investigate, and many Christmas toys have come to life and start attacking them, including der Klown the demonic jack-in-the-box that swallows Jordan whole, an action figure, a doll, a teddy bear; and three gingerbread men, Lumpy, Dumpy and Clumpy. Following this chaos, the Krampus' elves abduct Dorothy, Howard, and the baby before suddenly leaving again, the remaining family decide to make a run for a snow plow in the street, Omi buys them time by sacrificing herself. Tom, Sarah and Linda are abducted by the snow creature and the elves take Stevie, leaving only Max, he begs the Krampus to give him his family back and take him instead, the creature considers and holds Max over a pit into the underworld, into which Stevie was thrown. Max apologises to the demon for losing his Christmas spirit, Krampus accepts his apology, but throws him into the pit anyway, but Max awakens in bed on Christmas morning, it was all a dream, everything in the house and outside is back to normal, with the family opening presents, the family however are still being watched by the Krampus and his helpers, through a snow globe. Also starring Sophie Gannon as Hero Dark Elf (Bjúgnakrækir), Ivy George as Perchta the Cherub and Seth Green as Lumpy. Scott, Collette and the other cast do their parts fine, it takes a while for the title monster to actually appear, but when he does show up he is suitably nasty looking, the Krampus is based on the European folklore character, but new are the evil gingerbread men and possessed toys, the film is darkly humorous and the complete opposite of the regular cheery Christmas movie, you will either love it for being bonkers, or just say ""bah humbug"" to it, it's an average, mildly enjoyable seasonal comedy horror. Worth watching!"
