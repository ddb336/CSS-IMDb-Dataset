" Dark but good.
",0.5927,0.9854,2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,This movie may have a lot of potty humor and inappropriate humor but once you look past all that stuff it's a great story. It's about a man named Hank who is stranded on a island. When he is about to give up he sees a body on the shore who's name is Manny. Manny's body is gassy and Hank uses this to his advantage to get to shore. Now he is stuck on land he searches for civilization with Manny who has superhuman abilities. But I think this is a good buddy Drama/comedy there are a few funny moments besides just potty humor. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe is amazing even though he is a dead body he does the character very well. And Paul Dano plays a stranded man who is just trying to survive very well too. But to sum this up. A very good movie and a must watch on my list.

" As original As It Gets
",0.3182,0.824,2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"This film is by no means for everybody, it is extremely weird and if not watched with an open mind will be unwatchable.
But even if the movie it self didn't sit well with you, we should always support movies that are that original, in a world where everything is a remake or something we have seen 1000 times.
As for the actual film it's anything but for an 8 years old like I see in so many reviews. It might use ""stupid"" humor but only as a mean to talk about serious stuff, and it does that in a very genius way."
" It started out as something ""weird"" but ended up being proud of its own weirdness.
",0.4215,0.3989,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"There can not be a concept more original than that of Swiss Army Man in a time where almost nothing is original anymore. With a premise as bizarre as it is heartful, Swiss Army Man puts together on screen a tale of friendship, acceptance and self-identification told through the lens of a shy introverted man stranded on an island and a corpse that washes up on the same shore.With its weirdness putting me off at first and certain scenes in the first half that I found distasteful and hard to stomach, I never expected to be in any way emotionally moved by it, but damn was I touched by the time it ended.So glad I gave this movie a shot!"
" Originality still exist

" WTF Did I Just Watch?!?
",-0.7339,0.6763,2021-02-06 00:00:00,3,"I am probably being complimentary, when taken as a whole.The movie I saw immediately before this one was 'The Lobster' and that made more sense. Honestly, in retrospect, an M Night Shamalayan movie seems oddly more coherent than maybe both of them. Irony is ironical.The screenplay in itself is OK; but, there is a difference between a cryptic ending and a cryptic start-to-finish. Basically, a better 'Blair Witch Project' without all the shakyvision and 'found' footage."

" Could've been amazing, but it's not
",0.34,0.8956,2021-01-16 00:00:00,5,"Swiss Army Man could've been amazing. I loved the concept it had going. It set out to tackle something so simple and it almost nailed it, but this film's ultimate downfall was the mysticism. I hated the magic powers that Daniel Radcliffe's character had. Not only was it stupid, it was used for comedy that simply wasn't funny, it was eye rolling. Also, there were some pointless elements included that should've been removed and also the ending felt so awkward and unfulfilling, they really could've worked on that more. I feel like the filmmakers really had a vision, one that could've worked if they simply removed the slapstick comedy aspect and maybe have rewritten the script a few times. The direction and the music was good for the most part. I really wanted to love this film, but I don't. I rate Swiss Army Man a 5/10."
" Simply Fantastic

" Paul Danos ANNOYING humming voice
",-0.5319,-0.529,2021-01-07 00:00:00,6,"So being honest I'm sure it's a well acted movie. Dano is a very solid actor as is Daniel.
However it's hard to stomach movies that resort to a constant overlay of ""weird music"" to make things seem edgy or profound.I'm 15mins in and it's been almost nothing but a constant orchestral overlay of Paul Dano humming or singing children's tunes.How the Director failed to notice that his voice in that capacity is like nails on a damn chalkboard I'll never know.
If they wanted to make a movie about descent into madness on an island in a serious or funny way they didn't need to have it done to the constant children's orchestral lullaby of PAUL DANOS VOICE.It distracts and offputs everything. It's a compelling movie but the constant break of immersion due to this hideous sound track is atrocious."
" Dirty, smelly, ugly, worthless, boring, disgusting.
",-0.93,-0.9383,2020-12-18 00:00:00,1,"There are far better ways to portray shame, guilt, lust, and seclusion. Continuous farting isn't a way to introduce a character (even an alter ego!). Cinema can be dirty, it can be disgusting, but it can also be good, unfortunately this is disgusting to the core, extremely boring, repetitive, and inexplicably bad. If you are watching this, please don't even drink a glass of water, you may want to throw up. Probably one of the most pointless films I've seen, even though the plot seems interesting at first. However, when you see a suicidal boy surfing on the water using his alter ego's farts you do get inspired to switch off the TV and throw up."

Are you incapable of thinking for yourself? Do you own a collection of vintage polaroid cameras? Are thrift stores considered fashionable? If you answered YES to everything, then boy, do i have a film for you, my Art School Dropout friend. Swiss Army Man is a movie about farts, but really, farts are symbolic for life, and the will to live. Farts propel our characters forward. The narrative moves along with every little fart that gets released. Fart is Art. Fart is Love. The Girl? Couldn't care; girls are cruel, and Harry Potter is dead. A lot of nonsense occurs in this film and people will defend it as such... don't you see? the bear is symbolic for male chauvinism, don't you see? The main character is coming to terms with his sexuality... don't you see? Water is life, so when Harry potter bursts out in water it means the dead came back to life, which means Paul Dano is alive... don't you see???? What i see is a severe pile of fecal matter passing for a coherent movie about a pile of fecal matter. Total Utter Garbage. 3/10oh you like my review now? tell your friends about me"

",0.0,-0.4404,2020-10-16 00:00:00,5,At first Swiss Army man feels like that strange kid in your 3rd grade class that would do gross stuff to get everyone's attention. But as the story progresses there is much more to the story. You will be confused and possibly grossed out watching it but it's worth it in the end. Maybe.
" Idk...
",0.0,-0.1983,2020-10-11 00:00:00,5,"I give it massive points for being original. We complain about no original stories, then when we get them, we don't watch them or just bash them...However, it's just to out there and goofy for me. I know it's got all kinds of hidden meanings and messages spread throughout... but I think I missed most of them. I know there's some grand point to it... but again, I maybe missed it.Yes, it allowed him to understand what really matters in life, and how we shouldn't allow the small things and our fears to hold us back... but it seems there is more trying to be said/taught here than just that... but yeah..I couldn't STAND Daniel as the Harry Potter character, yet everytime I watch him on film, I find it impossible to dislike him, his pure talent shows in all of his adult work. The guy is a great actor, and I believe he's extremely undervalued in Hollywood. Maybe it's being linked to Potter, maybe it's that he doesn't quite fit the ""sexy"" stereotype of a leading man... I don't know, but whatever it is, it needs to be gotten over, because Daniel could star in and lead almost any sort of film, with any sort of cast. His recent work in ""Jungle"", ""Horns"", ""Woman in Black"", ""Guns Akimbo"" showed us once again, this man can pull off any role! Action, drama, SciFi, Horror... he can do it all!This film though just was too goofy for my liking."
" Very original
",0.3804,0.7848,2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,"One of the things I like more in films is originality. The older I get the more numb I become regarding movies, and everything just seems a rehash of something else, so when I see some spark of originality I am usually very happy. This is such a film. It is a very sad story told from a very different perspective that I can't help but admire it. People complain about the farts and the meaning of all that is on screen, but I really don't think this is such a hard movie to decipher. It's just a fresh look at mental illness and almost everything is very self-explanatory once you understand what's going on. Both leads do a fantastic job and the direction is very entertaining for such a hard subject. I don't rate this any higher because some parts didn't go with my taste, but I'd rather see someone try something different and come a bit short than just be safe and not risk anything."

" Very nearly a perfect movie
",0.6096,-0.9586,2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,"This review is intended to be read by those who have already seen the film. Pointless, I know.When the film was released, I had heard the buzz about it and thankfully, I stayed away from detailed reviews and spoilers of it. And I'm very thankful that I did. This review WILL contain major plot elements and some spoilers.On a whim, without preparation or care, I decided to just watch it. Knowing about the farting and how the film opens, I was prepared for that much. And it was silly. Stupid, really. I actually almost checked out less than 10 minutes into the film. I can see why there was so many walkouts from it's premiere at Sundance.But then I realized it was a much deeper, darker dive into the psyche of a person on the edge of emotional reality. Through most of the film, I was almost sure that the entire thing was happening inside of Hank's mind in the moments just before his death as a result of him hanging himself. The small clues of him speaking about the ""seeing your life flash"" seemed to match up to Manny's quite childlike amazement of everything and knowing nothing from the beginning through to some kind of adolescence and puberty with the SI magazine. And then to finding real love and experiencing that life, as I assumed that he eventually DID all the things they played out, finally meeting the girl and falling in love, etc.THEN, I thought that maybe some of it was real, but he was just reliving the lost opportunities of talking to the girl on the bus, and creating a new reality that he would live out, using a corpse as a surrogate self.THEN, I thought again that almost none of it was real, even the existence of Manny by the time they ended up on Sarah's back lawn. I though that it would be revealed that there was no Manny and that Hank was the one in the body bag, dead just as he reached his only goal to see Sarah one last time as he succumbed to exposure.But then all of those expectations were subverted and it suggests that almost all of what was shown in the film actually happened as other characters discovered the playsets and the abilities of Manny. That part was a little disappointing as it's the least interesting (and most ridiculous) way to explain things in the film.However, I'll admit that I cried harder and longer and in more scenes during this film than any other film I've ever seen. This is a masterclass of acting, directing, editing and scoring to create more emotion in two characters than I've ever seen. Even more of an achievement because one of the characters did not move on his own.The way this story is told through cinematography and character development just worked on every level my brain can appreciate. I give it a 9 instead of a 10 because it is still a bit silly in parts and I really didn't enjoy the father character or how the story resolved itself at the end. It felt like they shoehorned in a ""best case scenario"" for what I was preparing to be a soul-crushingly tragic yet satisfying end for Hank.I'm left wondering what Hank learned or discovered through this story. He was essentially living a fantasy lie, infatuated with the idea of a woman and a life that from the outside would be interpreted as nothing short of stalking. When he finally acted on his unhealthy obsession, he was arrested and will likely be charged with a list of offenses, desecration of a corpse included. Pretty dark.But that doesn't change the fact that it was the most heartwarming and heartbreaking film I've seen in a decade or more. A film about a farting corpse. Highly recommended."

" Incredibly stupid and boring
",-0.7397,-0.9701,2020-06-01 00:00:00,2,"I don't get the appeal with this one. I saw it on a recommendation, and really wish I hadn't. Ok, yeah, it has some psychological aspects to it, which can be appealing, but the stupidity of the movie ruins any good qualities it has. For an idea of what you're in for, the main character literally rides a corpse he found like a jet ski being propelled by the corpse's farts (not kidding), uses the corpse as a never-ending water fountain he drinks from, causes the corpse to develop an erection, which is then used as a compass, oh, and let's no forget about the subtextual themes of necrophilia. Yeah, there's dumb stuff like this throughout the whole movie. And while you can debate that not everything actually happens was real and some takes place in the main characters mind, it doesn't take away the sheer stupidity of what we're seeing. Maybe it would have been better if it had been strictly about the guy using the corpse to communicate with in order to cope, but all this other stuff they threw in ruins all of the good qualities the movie has. I really don't see the appeal and can't believe it's gotten as much praise as it has."

" Crazy and original but also plenty of profound themes
",-0.0129,0.9903,2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,"""Swiss Army Man"" is a fantastic movie that is able to explore important themes in an unusual way thanks to a smart idea. Indeed the movie is about a man that hasn't any reason to live and it's thinking about suicide that becomes friend with a dead body. The fact is that the dead body at one point becomes alive but he has no idea of what life is. In a way is like a little child that asks to his parents simple questions about everything he doesn't know. But the dead body is an adult and so the movie can explore deeper themes like love, sex, social interaction and what life is in general. The way in which all of these aspects are touched is very original and very touching in some points with some poetic elements. The film is also very funny and it balances very well laughs and emotional moments. I've read a lot of criticism about the farting jokes but I feel the point is missed in these instances: farting in the movie is more important than mere jokes because it's a metaphor of freedom and trust.
""Swiss Army Man"" is a crazy picture but it's very very good. Do yourself a favour and watch it if you can."

" Probably the weirdest romance ive ever seen!!!
",0.5538,0.9967,2020-04-08 00:00:00,7,"Swiss Army Man is as weird as you can get on so many levels. But at the essence of it is a broken, lost and desperate man who is just looking for love. When a body washes up on the coast just a moment before he finally kicks the bucket, he suddenly finds a friend, a boat of a sort, and later a romantic interest. Their journey takes them trough a lot of new and past experiences. A movie like this one would never work if you dont have strong actors, in the two leading roles with good charisma and professional chemistry between them. Radcliffe and Dano are doing an awesome job and seem like the perfect casting choices for the movie. With their future film debut the Daniels bet on one of the weirdest screenplays ever written. The film tries to balance between the macabre character of its premise and the idea that love could save us even in the most difficult situations. The message of the story is that we should embrace our nature and be more open minded when it comes to already established ideas about what is to be in love and to be alive. My issues with the film are the lack of diversity in the locations. Besides from the opening scene on the coast, a river crossing and of course the wonderfully edited bus scene the movie is sort of dull when it comes to its locations with dirt and trees dominating almost all of the screen time. The humorous and a bit supernatural abilities of Radcliffs body dont bother me, but i just wish that Danos character could be something more than a boy with a crush for the girl on the bus. As an experimental piece the movie is a success. Its themes of necrophilia and using the body of a death man as a vehicle and a tool angered a lot of viewers which is always a desirable characteristic for a provoking film, like this one. Ultimately i think its a fresh story, with perhaps too much comedy for my personal taste, but nonetheless a good amount of charm and good work behind it."

It's weird. Very weird. Personally, that weirdness totally worked for me. I loved every moment of it, which not everyone will. For some, a lot even, this will be too out there to get into and I totally get that.Weirdness aside, the performances are exceptional. For the most part, Dano and Radcliffe are all alone and they do a great job in captivating the viewer.

Here we are years latter, and its on Netflix, with rave reviews, and I'm thinking, ""Has everyone gone mad?"" So I had to watch it.The movie starts out with Hank stranded on a rocky island, trying to hang himself because his boat capsized, he's starving, lost, and given up hope for salvation. Just as he's about to hang, a person washes up. Later we find out his name is Manny. Manny had many talents, one of which is his farts propel them through the water to land. Yes his gas... At this point I'm about 15 minutes in, I've given the movie a fair shake, but I've come too far to just give up. What ensues is the most BIZARRE, buddy movie/bro-mance/romance film, with a little bit of magic in it. I honestly smiled a little in a couple places, but mostly I was disgusted by the bodily functions.I don't do spoilers, and I won't here, BUT, I don't want you to think it's all negative. Towards the end, everything starts coming together, and the revelations are MASSIVE. Paul Dano plays his character SO BEAUTIFULLY, that it breaks my heart just Loki n at the soulfulness in his eyes! He literally brought me to tears!!! He deserved a standing ovation, seldom other than on Broadway have I seen such an intense, emotional performance!I can't believe I'm saying this, but YES!

I've seen the trailer quite some time ago and I wanted to give this movie a watch at last.What really drew me to the film was the obvious Daniel Redcliffe, as well as Dank from ""Little Miss Sunshine.""Both of the actors did VERY well in this particular film. I'm so used to seeing Daniel Radcliffe depicted as Harry Potter and this man can really pull of a variety of different characters.Daniel Redcliffe was depicted as a corpse that washed up on the shore of a deserted island. Paul Dano plays as a mentally unstable suicidal man that has lost hope in everything in life, and is very close to hanging himself. However, the corpse gives him a sense of hope, and is the biggest symbolic piece of the entirety of the film.Overall the acting as a whole was impressive. Each characters traits were captivating and helped carry the story on well.The plot of the film doesn't seem promising initially, but as the story progresses the two characters begin to bond and you see lots of growth and a friendship starting to bond. This makes you feel for the characters and makes you want to know more about them.The problem I have with the film is how much it drags on in certain parts. The humor in this film is pretty much non existent... Few funny lines here and there. The plot is unique however, and it would be worthwhile to at least check it out and see what you think.In the end it's a movie you'll either love or hate. Lots of questions will arise as the movie progresses, but it's definitely a captivating film overall and one you won't forget."

Yeah, DR's a corpse and yeah, PD uses the body in some ...interesting...ways- but the laughs are more at some truly funny & timely societal commentary. And if your mood is right, you might need a tissue for a feelin' or two that might crop up. Not only a buddy flick, this is also a romance film but not for the faint of heart! Nothing gross, I just mean it really makes you think about the nature of love and who might embody (pun intended) that love. A few surprises, more farts than really necessary (but that was to be expected), and I gotta give Danny R true kudos for best acting from a cadaver!

There were many people who said that this was a stupid, unrealistic movie that just depended on cheap fart jokes, but there were also many who said that this movie was a deep, emotional message about social norms and self-delusion.So it was really a love it or hate it movie, and I must say, I'm leaning towards the love it side. This movie is so much more than just fart jokes, and if you think that you can see past those then it is really an amazing movie that you should watch right now. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe's performances were great, the cinematography was very pleasing and definitely exceeded my expectations, and just the ride and rush of feelings and emotions that we as an audience are put through is just unforgettable. At 97 minutes long, this movie does not waste a single second of it's runtime, especially not the ending, which is a fantastic one and gives you something to think about afterwards.I'm glad I watched this movie, despite the negative feedback it got from a bunch of people, and after reading my review I hope I convinced you to watch it too, you will not regret it."

" Spending time with a dead body. That's a different story.
",-0.6486,0.9401,2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Swiss Army Man is kind of very difficult to review. Normally, I find it's very difficult to review on the films which are going with the steady plot. I mean which have no exciting scenes, something like that. Swiss Army Man is one of those kinds of films.I like the fact that the leading character, Hank, has to spend time with a dead body, Manny to get rid of boredom because there's no one with him. That's pitiful. It's not an easy thing to do because it makes you seem that you're a crazy person. I mean talking to yourself really makes a crazy person. But he doesn't have a choice but to do like that.What I like of this film is how they spend time together. Even it's a dead body, but it seems like he's having fun with another living person. Those scenes are so much fun. I really love those scenes and they make me feel warm.Daniel Radcliffe's dead body face expression is so funny. Because of it, I feel like this film gets better and better. The whole time, he really looks like a dead body. I mean he does have any movement on his face or the whole body. It might be very hard to act.All in all, Swiss Army Man is something different from which I've seen. The story is very simple but it has so much fun. Although the concept of dead body makes me disgusting but in time, it gives me fun and thus, this film is kind of worth watching."
" This is probably the best movie ever made. I'll tell you exactly why.
",0.6369,-0.9921,2019-05-14 00:00:00,10,"I'd like to think I have a special connection with Hank. I've been through some of the things he has, some obvious, some things are going missed that only a person like me might notice. This film deals with real life matters that make people uncomfortable, which says a lot about every human being. Recurring themes of rejection, and infatuation are visited and revisited in monologue and behavior. In life, many people spend their whole lives avoiding uncomfortable topics that shape us through our whole life, and these are the people discarding this masterpiece.It's important to recognize that Hank has lost his battle with sanity. He's grappled with the notion of suicide repeatedly, and has grown up with the fantasy that a ""happily ever after"" life is just around the corner. (Most of us are indoctrinated on this concept by loving parents). The more desperate Hank is to have it, the more disconnected he becomes with reality. The death of his mother has caused a tremendous rift between himself and his father, in which both are unable to recover. (Trust me this movie is more about the death of his mother than anything). Sexual desire has always played a negative role on Hank. This was likely passed from his father when his father was unable to cope after his mother died, and repressed all natural sexual urges on to Hank. Hank grew up through puberty disgusted with his own body, and meeting rejection from every girl he's ever known because he's so uncomfortable with himself which is compounded by how his mother tried to explain what it means to grow into puberty before she died. Every thought he has about attraction is repressed, and he hates himself for it. His pure intentions are to find love. The trauma that has been building up within him has forced him to live daily in fantasy, and no one can relate to him anymore. He doesn't talk about his feeling/misgivings to anyone. His shame becomes so overpowering that he runs off into the forest to disappear in the hope someone will care enough to come find him (he's hoping it's his dad). He begins to live a fantasy where he hasn't run off, but is a castaway of an unexplained boat sinking on an island. (There never was an island, but he DID try to kill himself, and botched it.) He found a dead body on the shore and began talking about all of the things that were eating him up inside, that no one was there for him since his mother died years ago. At some point, either through reckless starvation and stress he completely loses his grip on reality, and imagines Manny has come to life. But something happens in the cave and some things Manny does ARE REAL. Hank is so out of touch with reality, he can't tell the difference anymore. He begins to heal by becoming a mentor to Manny. (WHO IS ACTUALLY HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL). I believe Manny is actually the spirit of his mother.Manny and Hank begin to talk only about the things that are causing him so much pain. Especially his pure intentions hidden behind his shame of natural things that have been taught to be vile, and repulsive (Probably by his father). He finally learns that living life, and living to the fullest involves all of those vile and repulsive things we are all conditioned to discard.He reveals that he needs his father's love to Manny and it is painstakingly obvious that the two of them never mourned the death of Hank's mother together.The whole climax of the movie is a truly sad one. Hank talks about the virtual birthday card, and his sadness is portrayed as a brutal need for his love.Manny does in fact come to life a few times to save Hank, and he is alive when he talks to Sarah's daughter. The little girl is not afraid of Manny because there is a connection of innocence.After all of the themes mentioned, and some not mentioned, Hank finally speaks to Sarah, WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S EVER ASKED FOR HELP IN HIS LIFE ~He is THAT repressed. He is really avoiding his father because their relationship is completely broken. He begins to deal with the reality of the infatuation that could have lead to real love has now passed.His father's character is perfectly conveyed when he shows up to identify the body (which he was told to be his son's). His father is driving an old truck that probably has sentimental ties to his wife, and he doesn't look like he's doing well. At this time I assume Hank's father's character has settled into a dead end job, and hasn't grown beyond what he was when he lost his wife. ""Essentially my dad personally. Hank isn't ready to talk to his father, and is afraid of what he might say. Hank's dad goes to identify Hank's body, but absolutely can't. He's crushed, it's too much to bear. When Hank sees his father's reaction, he actually starts to feel loved, and doesn't want Manny to be unloved. He abandons his hope for himself in order to prevent Manny from being discarded.The cops, news, Sarah and Hank's father come across the things Hank has built in the forest, and his father sees the dummy Hank made of him, and realizes how much he has wasted with his relationship with his son after the death of his wife.By the time Hank is ready to let go of his fantasy, he's put himself in such a looney bin his life future will never be worth living unless he knows for himself some of the things he did were really real.He's strong enough to face his demons, but as he walks off, our guardian angel, Manny, decides to show a small gesture that Hank is not completely insane, and the magical things he's rambling on about might have actually happened.In that moment his father saw Hank in a completely different way. He never understood Hank, or nurtured him, but he wasn't ashamed of him at all despite everything that has happened.
This was all his father needed to revive his relationship with his son, and be the nurturing support that Hank has been denied since the death of his mother. (Which I believe Manny, was his mother all along.). ""But personally, I believe that things like that happen from time to time just out of range of our perception ""MASTERPIECE"

The novelty of his character wears off pretty quickly, though I must admit, seeing Paul Dano MacGyver a dead corpse is amusing for what it's worth.

",0.5106,0.9604,2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I thought that this movie started off great, it's an extremely original concept and the surreal dark humor really helped drive the story.It told the story of the anxiety caused by a modern existence in a nuanced and almost whimsically dark manner that I was really enjoying.I was fully convinced that we were witnessing the absurd fantasy of a troubled young man trying to cope with his life and shortcomings and that it was even perhaps the ""life flashing before his eyes"" that he referenced in the opening scene and perhaps his initial suicide attempt was actually successful.Up until the final act I would have rated this film an 8 or a 9, but beginning with the bear scene at the end they really started laying on the nihilism thickly and they in some ways broke a fourth wall of sorts with the final scene by grounding the whole story in reality rather than leaving it open to interpretation.I think that it could have ended much more cleanly, only involving the two main characters and it would have been a better film for it.Having said that, I still give this film a 7 for great acting and great originality. This is a film that certainly isn't going to be for everyone, but also one you won't forget quickly."
" Not a Childish Comedy - My Response to Negative Reviews
",-0.6023,0.9757,2019-03-12 00:00:00,8,"I read a very thorough review on this movie asking what the ""deep"" meanings supposedly presented in this film were. Addressing this question is quite complicated, considering the fact that meanings are a very subjective topic.
Opinions vary greatly depending on who they're coming from, so I will specify that I am someone who has been suffering depression, and this film made me look at life from new eyes.I don't personally like seeing it this way, but for those who hold prejudice upon childish humor or fantasy, try seeing Manny as an imaginary being; a coping mechanism that Hank has subconsciously built to cope with loneliness and depression.The symbolism here is not abstract, quite straightforward;1. The forest is a filter (Only remnants of the ""real world"" are here in the form of trash). It is a simplified summation of life that is a perfect setting in which Manny can help Hank on his journey to finding hope. Hank sees himself as trash, another piece of the lively human population that is worthless. This is when Manny comes in.2. Manny is a new view on everything. Manny helps Hank realize that trash is not useless. While Hank struggles for survival, Manny is the voice that reminds Hank that there is no point of surviving if he is not living. He teaches Hank that even with nothing but trash and a gross farting corpse, he can have the time of his life.I'm not sure what kind of ""deep meaning"" the reviewer was expecting, but I don't know a message that has been more important to me in these hard times than one that helps me find the beauty in everything. How even amidst childish humor, a childish mind holds a world of imagination and positivity that can save a man's life.Another recurring point was that this movie was slow and disgusting. I would see how one may think that with the expectation of a comedy. If you're expecting witty and intelligent jokes, you will find plenty someplace else. Swiss Army Man is NOT a comedy. It is a journey of a broken man, scraping the bottom of popcorn bags, desperate to find a reason to live.I think many ""negative"" reviews towards this film were reasonable in their own sense, and I respect them. I hope they, too, can find a film that they can fall in love with as much as I did with this one."

",-0.743,0.9365,2019-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Weird as hell. Felt like a real mission getting through the film... but the end resolves everything. Still not sure what to make of it all. The writing is very 'this decade' with metaphysical stipulations about the self, identity, existence, sexuality, meaning. The filming itself is incredible. They've managed to achieve a near flawless execution, achieving things that I've never seen before. The acting is unpretentious and will hopefully set these actors up with more respect. Considering most the film is just set in one or two locations, with the camera mostly focussed on just one or two people, one of whom is lifeless, it manages to keep the audience engaged and interested with humorous - though bordering on creepy and psychopathic at times - interactions with themselves and the environment. We are constantly reframing the plot in our minds and imagining what might actually be happening. You won't find out what was actually happening until the very end. And that's the genius of it, though I will not explain this for you here. If you do watch it and get to the end, then will you have understood the plot. Other themes: obsession, mind and thoughts (power of thoughts on others), insanity. Regarding the filming again: I really couldn't work out how some of it was done... sometimes it looked almost as if they were playing bits backwards (in reverse)... or maybe that was just the acting."

The truth is, I have a doctorate degree, even and undergrad in Psychology, and I found the movie...well, it was ok. It was not the best movie I have ever seen. One thing you CAN say about this movie is, it's different. Very different.
I won't give any spoilers here other than I would suggest you watch all of it. If you pull out and give up on it, you really will miss out on an ending that pulls everything together, kinda. I kept telling my wife, this is bound to all be explained in the in and it will be nothing we expected. I was sorta right.
Alas, it does leaving you not really knowing how to react...should we laugh, should we cry, should we feel sorry for the lead guy or should we get angry at all of the people around him for not understanding? Hmmm still trying to figure some of it out. I'll let you watch and decide for yourself.

This movie had me, admittedly, skeptical. After a few minutes of selling into it, I saw a story that we can all relate to on some level. It's a story of our fearls of being seen for what we really are, no edits. It's asking why we judge each other and ourselves down to the most basic and fundamental parts of just being living creatures.By the end of this movie, my partner, my son and I were laughing as tears steamed down or cheeks. Not many movies have done that to me. I also have to throw in that when my teenage son is swept up by a movie to the point of crying and laughing simultaneously, it would be far from pretentious to say he loved it.If you don't mind some brutal honesty about the things that make us all human and you're willing to open your mind to something truly different, this film will have you laughing, choking up, and everything in between in a way you'd never experienced before.

" Unapologetically Human
",0.0,0.9806,2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"This film tells the story of perspective, open-mindedness, and acceptance. Through the adventure of an adolescent boy in the wilderness with nothing but the clothes on his back and a dead body, this film demonstrates deeper thoughts important in today's climate. While the surrealist presentation with low brow comedy may not enamour everyone, I think it is an extremely adept method of storytelling in this instance and helps condition the viewer to the key concepts. It makes you wonder what actually is ""real"", and if and why it truly matters in the end. It dives nose deep into an individual's perception of reality and unapologetically questions the social constructs around us, like why certain actions or thoughts are so stigmatized to the point it creates emotional trauma on the individual (even as trivial as releasing gas).The film starts out slow, and takes getting some used to, especially if you don't know what it's supposed to be about. If you give it enough time and attention, this journey wraps together in an emotional end aided by Dano and Radcliffe's great chemistry.Mental Illness seems to be an important theme in this film as well. While Dano's character does some clearly questionable things with a dead body (to the point of having a deep friendship with him), it forces you to question how the circumstances factor in. A lonely, socially outcast adolescent in a survival situation where all the societal ""norms"" are thrown out the window, and his true individual is allowed to come out. Some may call that mental illness, but at the end of the day it is an individual finding some sort of peace through emotional freedom, even if when returning to civilization people don't understand. Even if you personally don't buy into that sort of stuff, it gives a good perspective on what some sufferers of depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia feel like. What Hank (Dano's character) experienced in the film is undoubtedly human, free, and should be recieved by an open mind in a world that typically looks down on people for being different in this way.In the end, props to this film for not being afraid to bring up difficult topics in an entertaining way that really does envelope you in the mind of Hank, real or not."

" Well, it's definitely unique
",0.5859,0.9764,2018-10-23 00:00:00,7,"I feel pretty confident in saying that ""Swiss Army Man"" has a premise that you haven't seen in any other movie. In this day and age, that's saying something in and of itself. Whether that's enough to carry an entire movie is another story.The premise here is that a lonely & hopeless man stranded on a deserted island more or less befriends a corpse that washes up on shore. While trying to make their way back to civilization the two bond. The living guy teaches the dead one about life and the dead guy functions as sort of a human version of a Swiss Army knife. To say that the premise is off the wall is an understatement. Yet, there does seem to be a metaphorical underpinning to this relationship, though it's one that you'll have to infer for yourself since the filmmakers don't dwell on it. Of course, it's possible that it could all just be pure fantasy with little deeper meaning, though I doubt it.Considering that almost all of the movie's runtime is focused on just two individuals, this is a movie that demands a lot from its actors. Paul Dano especially, since his character is actually alive. You might think that Daniel Radcliffe would have limited opportunities for expression since he plays a corpse but the role is more interesting than you might think. Strange as it may sound, Dano & Radcliffe actually have good chemistry together and you buy into their friendship as a result. The rest of the small cast is mostly undistinguished, though it does include Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a small but pivotal role.Stylistically, the movie is nicely done, though it does have its eccentricities. Mostly, it's quirky in roughly the same way that other so-called 'quirky' movies are quirky. The music reflects this and just the general visual style (cinematography, editing, etc...). It's arguably a case of style over substance, though I do think that there is some substance at the bottom of this movie if you care to give some thought to what you're watching.While I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this movie it's definitely worth watching for someone who thinks they've seen it all. Even then, their reaction could just as easily be to hate it rather than love it. Personally, I think that the meaning of the story might be a bit too obscure for most viewers (at least as far as I've interpreted it) but it's told with enough panache to save the movie from being weird without being entertaining."

" For everyone who thinks this movie is just fart jokes...
",0.0,-0.9885,2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"I was compelled to respond to all the 1 star reviews. As someone who actually really dislikes fart jokes, finding them to be lazy writing that only attempts to appeal to the lowest common denominator, I can sympathize with anyone who would be skeptical of this movie at first.But I love this movie. These are not merely fart jokes, but a much deeper and richer metaphor. There's another review on here that goes into some length to describe how Dano's character Hank is an unreliable narrator, a troubled and delusional, suicidal man in the midst of a mental breakdown. While I find that review to be an accurate reading it doesn't fully explore the film's use of metaphor which function on many levels. The first level is the film's plot itself which can be read as everything we are being shown is really happening, or that we are seeing things from Hank's perspective and he is hallucinating and delusional.But to go deeper than that, this is a movie about shame and repression so strong that it makes you unable to express your own inner feelings. It directly comments on this in numerous ways, through the long discussion of Hanks's shameful feelings about masturbation, how he constantly tells Manny not to do things because people will think he is being weird. Manny is doing what comes naturally and just being honest and talking without filters. Everything is new to him and he approaches the world like a child, wondering and asking questions about everything.Manny is innocent and has not learned shame yet. Society shames all of us, and teaches us that there are right and wrong ways of behaving. There are proper ways of behaving in public, and as children, when we act naturally, we are usually shamed, maybe even punished for breaking the rules of polite society. These rules rely on numerous pre-concieved notions but are in actuality completely arbitrary. The idea that a fart or a boner are gross are value judgement that rely on the idea that there can be something wrong with our natural body functions. Thus are we taught to be ashamed of our own bodies, taught to conceal nudity and hold in our farts.I could go further into how religion and polite society frame innocent body functions as perversions, but Hank's insecurity extends into shaming of other behavior, his repression is so extensive that he is uncomfortable in expressing basic emotions. This is explored through the recreation of meeting the girl on the bus, and how someone without preconceived notions of right and wrong behavior and societal repression would approach the situation entirely differently. Dano is so afraid of how other's might perceive him that he never approaches this girl he feels a connection to, Hank is his un-repressed inner asking him why anyone would ever stop themselves from doing what would make them happy.So this movie is questioning society's arbitrary rules, public shaming that causes social anxiety and shyness and forces people to conform to socially acceptable behavior. It uses body functions as a metaphor for that. Farting in the film is a metaphor for holding feelings inside or hiding your true self. In the final scene of the film Hank lets out a fart in front of other people in a last desperate attempt to revive Manny, Manny who represents his inner child. Throughout the film he brings Danny to life by letting go of and coming to terms with his inner repression, learning to re-approach life with playfulness, curiosity, and creativity, as a child would. So in that final scene he is ""letting go"" of his repression.There is one more level that all of this operates on, and it's here that I have to say that I have pity for people who could not see any deeper meaning in this film. Because it confronts the ways in which we take ourselves too seriously, when in reality part of the human condition is living in these strange and amazing and earthy vessels we call bodies. And bodies are amazing things that operate on a level of complexity that science still struggles to understand, outright magical in fact. But we ignore that magic and instead frame our viewing of our bodies with shame and repression. The film playfully confronts us with bodily functions in order to make us confront our own relationships with our bodies. As someone who normally despises bathroom humor I was amazed to find myself laughing out loud and feeling outright joy at moments of reveling in bodily humor that were outright triumphant.This is in part a movie that tries to teach us to enjoy life by taking it less seriously, by showing us a man who is learning to do the same. And so if you despise this movie, I think if you spent your time doing nothing but trying to learn to find enjoyment in this film, and trying to understand why other people do, you would find yourself letting go of repression and finding empathy beyond what you knew you were capable of. I think it would be entirely worth it."

" Incredibly Underrated Original Film
",0.3774,0.9946,2018-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Swiss Army Man is a movie best summarized by a quote from the directors: ""The first fart will make you laugh, the last fart will make you cry."" The film tells the story of Hank Thompson, a depressed man stranded on an island whose life is changed when he discovers a dead body with the ability to aid him in survival. The film follows Hank and Manny (the dead body) as they develop a friendship and discover what makes life worth living.The first five minutes of the film are a bit silly and weird, but once you get used to the concept, the film turns into a beautiful story of friendship. The movie is not afraid to play around with its tone. Sometimes the film feels fun and hilarious, filled with montages and music. Other moments take a more serious tone, commenting on bullying, social norms, and suicide. Surprisingly, this works very well.On a technical level, Swiss Army Man is beautiful to both listen and look at. The soundtrack for the film, written by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, is used beautifully to capture the emotions of the characters. The cinematography is vibrantly shot, utilizing reds, blues, and greens to compose wonderful visuals. Even the set design is delightful despite the film taking place primarily in the woods.Both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe give fantastic performances. Dano and Radcliffe have terrific chemistry, making their characters' relationship feel genuine. Radcliffe is hilarious as a dead body. What he does with his face and body is impressive; he makes himself look dead, but still full of emotion. Their performances are what drives the movie and makes this ridiculous concept work.Despite making fart and dick jokes, the film is not afraid to comment on topics such as conformity, exclusion, self-love, and being yourself. This film is best seen blind. The trailer does not give justice to this wonderfully original, touching film.The Good

" Charming, Weird, as Strange as Heck
",0.3182,0.994,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I recently watched Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; both are unbelievably strange, even surreal (especially Mind), and both very well done and refined and entertaining. I won't say tonight's movie is more entertaining, but I will say it certainly is stranger. Harry Potter meets Brian Wilson-- we're somehow reviewing Swiss Army Man.
 If you watched the trailer, that gives you a good, brief overview of the absurdity that takes place. Paul Dano is stranded on an island and is about to commit suicide when a body washes ashore. It's a dead Daniel Radcliffe, but as soon as Dano returns to trying to hang himself, the weird starts happening. Perhaps it's just his imagination, more likely it's a hallucination from his starvation, but Radcliffe's body starts acting in only the ways the writers could think up while I assume certainly intoxicated. There's certainly a very juvenile aspect to his motorboat farts and regurgitated water, but enough is done to provide ample laughter that doesn't die down as much as I first assumed it would.
Dano realizes he has a chance to get back to civilization with the multi-purpose titular Radcliffe body, and this is the thread to propel the story. But if all you get or all you assume you'll get from the movie is physical comedy with a simple story of trying to return from the wilderness, then you sir aren't looking deeply at all.
As he returns back to life, Radcliffe is hilariously rude and ignorant because he doesn't remember society at all, so Dano begins teaching him. The topics of family, friends, girls, etc. is all light-hearted and fun, and it also provides the time to reflect on Dano and how he himself never totally fit in with society to begin with. It brings about a little more existential problems, and adds a couple threads to story. It's not the most developed and it doesn't have to be because that's not what the movie is. And anybody who has seen the film can and will agree with me that there's no way to say what exactly this movie is. 
Dano is charming, but the gold star goes to the derpy-smiling Daniel Radcliffe. His childish antics never loses wit and lust as he determinedly wants to learn the ways of society and how to be happy. It's surprisingly funny and endlessly charming, but it is also so incredibly strange and that is a huge reason why it never really went to mainstream theaters-- it just doesn't have that kind of audience. Really I think it's much more individual-based on who would like the film. 
I will end with the ending (no spoilers, don't worry). I've heard complaints about how it ends, and the more I have thought it through, the more I am willing to defend it. The movie ending any other way just wouldn't be fitting strangely enough. It's a jigsaw piece that doesn't match any puzzle, yet it fits in with this film. Truthfully, the only question this movie will have you asking at the end will be, ""What did I just watch?"" Take that as you may, whatever I watched, I actually enjoyed it.

There's so much heart to this film, something I was rather shocked by. I found myself laughing out loud during several scenes at the comical, albeit crude absurdity of the situation and actions of Hank and Manny. Then, there were other scenes where I found myself almost holding back tears at the heartfelt conversations between them. There is a simple, yet relatable loneliness and sadness to Hanks character I think many people can relate to. While it may not be as deeply seeded as his, we've all gone through moments like that in our lives. Times of self-doubt, moments where we don't feel good enough, or attractive enough, or afraid we're going to make an idiot of ourselves for saying or doing the wrong thing. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Manny. There's a childlike curiosity and wonder to his character as he tries to remember life. The same goes for the bluntness and honesty in his responses and questions. At the core, it's a story that says, sometimes we just need a friend to bring out the best in us and show us our lives are more than just what is on the surface. That it's who we are deep down in our beings that counts, that life is too short to not show others how much we care, or to not take chances because of our insecurities and fear. I think that's a beautiful thing when a film can make you feel those emotions and be entertaining at the same time. That's just what this beautifully weird little film managed to do for me.
My Rating: 8/10"
" Weird but Good
",0.5423,0.9559,2018-04-28 00:00:00,7,This movie was a bit but good as well. I enjoyed the performance of Paul and Daniel. They were great.
" What the f...
",0.0,0.9838,2018-04-27 00:00:00,8,".. is actually a very good description of this movie.
Like many others I imagined it to be some kind of cast away with a corse for the volleyball but it was suprisingly different. At this point you should know that farting is an essential plot device in this movie and that it is actually used to underline it's statements. If you cant get over this fact don't even watch it, because it is very heavily featured.I can't help myself fealing kind of weird recommending this movie because it's just plain akward and even uncomfortable to watch at some instances. The cinematography is very good and the metaphoric value every set build has for the story is strongly admirable. After about thirty minutes of runtime I came to appreciate the movie for what it is. A character study and a reflection of human behavior, traditions, norms and values, which is mostly presented through dialogue between the two characters. Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano play they're characters in such an astonishingly believable and sweet way, that you can take them seriously at any time during the movie even though the plot is as ridicoulus as one could imagine. I think this is a piece that many will grow to appreciate after some time and it is definitely going to become a cult classic."
" I had hoped for better
",0.6705,-0.8153,2018-04-26 00:00:00,3,"This is a movie I could have done without seeing. By halfway through, I thought it must get better, alas not.
Fart humour is one thing, the random ramblings and fantasies are empty fluff that make me feel ill.
It didn't add anything to my life - Memorable in the wrong way."
" Farts! Farts! Farts!
",0.0,0.941,2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Hank Thompson (Paul Dano) is a castaway on a deserted island. He's preparing to hang himself when a body (Daniel Radcliffe) washes ashore. Using body gases, he rides the body like a jet ski back to the mainland. He starts talking to the body giving it the name Manny and teaching it rudimentary skills. Manny produces magical miracles to help him survive.Farts! Farts! Farts! I'm not offended but after some slightly amusing starting wackiness, the weirdness starts to bore me. None of it actually funny and it becomes more repetitive as it goes along. It's definitely unlike most other movies and I give it points for being different. It's great to see something unusual but otherwise, I would suggest skipping this."
" Best movie ever

" A strange mixture of life and fantasy
",-0.2023,0.7738,2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"""Swiss Army Man"" tells the story of a man who's stranded on a lonely island and in utter desperation when one day a corpse is released on the shore. After a series of bizarre events, he uncovers that his newly won company is actually still alife and now does everything he can to reach civilization and teach his friend about the life in the meantime.The film is quite bizarre and is probably produced to be so. Unfortunately, I didn't really like some of the scenes in which Daniel Radcliffe shows his abilities because they seemed just a bit too much over the top for me and I don't think they really enrichened the movie. Otherwise there are some nice thoughts about life and appreciating the little things woven into the story, that had, in my eyes, gained relevance through a more serious approach.All in all this is somehow unsatisfying because I do think there is a lot of potential but it sometimes gets left behind for a rather cheap joke or a quick laughter."
" Awful....
",0.0,0.6057,2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Skip this movie...There is nothing going on here. I found this movie to be just utter garbage. There is plenty of good movies in the world today, but this is not one of them, do not waste your time."
" Fantastically funny!
",0.4926,0.9513,2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Great performances by Dano & Radcliffe. 
I found the Radcliffe's compass penis and flatulence speedboat hilarious. 
I was quite disappointed that Dano's character didn't get together with the woman he loved though and she appeared to be married with a daughter but otherwise, this was a truly brilliant buddy comedy."
" A Weird Kind of Wonderful
",0.4588,0.9941,2018-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Swiss Army Man is the pure embodiment of what A24 are all about; it's original, creative, something a little out of the ordinary.The incredible performances from Radcliffe and Dano are what propel this film to great heights. Heart and emotion pours through in unorthodox ways that never feels anything but genuine. The humour, although would typically be seen as vulgar and juvenile amongst society, isn't off-putting; it doesn't take anything away from the film and adds to the candid and human nature of the narrative. Despite Swiss Army Man's fantastical elements, it provides realism and social commentary on the constructs and ideologies that have been placed upon us in society, as well as human thoughts, emotions, and connections. But it's the way it's handled and presented that I applaud most; it never feels pretentious or forced, it always feel sincere and focused on where it's going. The soundtrack/score is something that really stands out throughout the entirety of the film; it's beautiful and well incorporated, it perfectly balances the drama and heart. Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert told Dano they wanted to make a movie where ""the first fart makes you laugh and the last fart makes you cry"", and, as weird as that sounds, I can tell you, that's exactly what they did - and so effortlessly, too. Swiss Army Man will make you laugh, will make you cry, will make you think. It's a smart-man's film with great power and creativity that will distract you from reality and the inevitability of life, but, at the same time, open your eyes to it."
" Beautifully weird
",0.4588,0.8689,2018-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Unlike other reviewers I did not look for any deep meaning behind the film. I just love how weird and original it is. You will not see another film like this again. Had me in stitches, wonder, and confusion. Excellent performance by Paul Dano."
" Like nothing I have ever seen before.
",0.3612,0.8002,2018-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Swiss Army Man is the tale of healing through a very creative method. The way this film deals with pain and the will to live takes my breath away. I have never understood a character so well. 
My only critique would be that some parts of the film get a bit confusing such as the phone and the name mix up in the ending, but really other than that it is the best film I have seen in a very long time."
" Very entertaining.
",0.4927,0.8501,2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Great idea, great execution. I had much fun watching Swiss Army Man. The ending was kinda confusing, but i liked it anyway."
" Didn't Need to Be a Feature Film
",0.0,0.9845,2018-02-17 00:00:00,3,"Swiss Army Man opens with 5 minutes of fart jokes which really sets the scene for this movie. If you find stuff like that funny this movie will make an alright comedy, if you don't this movie has very little redeeming factors.If it was solely a toilet humor comedy I wouldn't really have an issue with this movei but it tries to be philosophical (not subtlety either) having this whole 'enjoy life for what its worth' message to it. Which is a message that has been done millions of times before.Another thing is that this movie is 97 minutes long which it really doesn't need to be but the directors seem so intent on drilling this message into your head they have to derail the objective of the main characters every 5 minutes to show you the 'value of the little things in life'.By far the best thing in this film is the way it's shot during the montages other than that this movie is mediocre at best.Swiss Army Man isn't offensively bad but it isn't worth your time."
" First 5 minutes was decent, downhill from there. Give this a miss! Watch ""Cast Away"" (or anything else) instead!
",-0.3257,0.9695,2018-01-27 00:00:00,2,"Without spoiling anything that's not in the synopsis, the film opens with our main character on a desert island, about to hang himself out of desperation -- when a dead body suddenly washes up on shore and causes him to reconsider. Okay... that was unexpected and I wanted to see where this was going. As the film's upbeat opening credits montage rolls, we see that the dead guy provides our protagonist with an unexpected use. By this point, I was already guessing that based on the film's title, the dead man would provide other survival-related functions, a bit like a Swiss Army Knife. Cool. Okay, so that having been established, what's next? Well, as it happens, not a whole lot. And that's a shame.As a 10-minute short film, SAM could have worked -- but as a feature-length film, it just drags and drags. I'd already read some reviews, including the one in my local (major city) newspaper, and was aware this film wasn't for everyone. But the paper's respected reviewer gave this film 3 stars out of 4 and closed by saying, ""all bets are off as to where this story is headed. But it's impossible not to get caught up in it, even if you're simultaneously repelled by it."" -- though after the 20-minute mark, that couldn't be any *further* from the truth. After enduring the film first 30 minutes and wondering ""Is this going somewhere?"" (the protagonist wasn't), we gave it another 10 minutes, then agreed to switch it off. And that's something we very rarely do -- like once or twice every 5 years, maybe.The next day, having looked through the ""Ordered By: Helpfulness"" reviews here on IMDb and seen so many high ratings and positive reviews , I decided to continue the movie, solo. I'm open minded, and no, I wasn't repulsed. But I also wasn't amused, entertained, or interested in any of the characters. I didn't find it at all ""intelligent"", as I'd seen some reviewers say, I didn't find anything redeeming about it, other than those first few opening minutes.Without spoiling the ending, the last 13 minutes of the film are so contrived that if you weren't already saying ""This is stupid!"", then you have no excuse not to be now. And not surprisingly, the movie even ends with a fizzle.Is Swiss Army Man unique? Sure. Is it worth watching? Most definitely not. If you do choose to watch it, well, you were warned!"
" what a strange film but you can't help but keep watching,
",-0.5085,0.2862,2018-01-22 00:00:00,6,I watched this film with my son who is 15 who found it hilarious . He suggested this film to me and he loved it. It is a very strange film kind of like tom hanks and wilson the ball but taken further. Some funny parts and some what the hell moments. Still worth a watch as its very different for what you usually find in films.
" A courageous (but far from perfect) tale of subjective happiness
",0.7906,0.9305,2018-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The first really good thing about this movie is that it makes you think and challenges you to find meaning in it (rather than turning your brain off).I laughed out loud several times and praised the originality of the first half an hour.Then it begins to be repetitive and some jokes were really painful (farts, farts and farts...)Then, the end made me think a lot (I rarely write reviews) about the fact that if we think we are happy, we really are happy: no matter about society's prejudices, consequences and constant farts.While it's worth a watch I can understand those too who walked out of the screening on Sundance festival"
" Unique, mostly fun, look at friendship
",0.7351,0.9975,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"An odd mix of 'Cast Away' and 'Weekend At Bernie's', 'Swiss Army Man' is better than both those films, thanks to it's unique look at life, friendship and loneliness - as well as the fact that it has two great actors fully committed to their characters. Hank (Dano) is stranded on an island when he finds Manny (Radcliffe), a corpse washed up on the beach. The excessively flatulent body helps him get back to the mainland (somewhere in Washington, Oregon, or northern California) - a great opening 10min. Still lost and starving in the wilderness, this is when Hank figures out that Manny can speak - and the whimsy begins! The next 20min are a little slow as Hank has to explain everything to Manny (including 'Jurassic Park'!), but then the adventure begins.Once they're on the move, the editing is pacier, the scenery looks great, the things Hank makes are wonderful and there's some true laugh out loud moments. The absurdity of it all is quickly forgotten, as Hank discovers Manny's ""superpowers"" and there's a great montage and some great stunts by Radcliffe. The dialogue between the two is fun, with Manny getting to almost learn like a child and ask inappropriate questions. You almost forget the character's dead, until they do something, like flop his head, to remind you he's a talking cadaver!One thing that keeps the film light and fun is the score by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, which uses no lyrics, just amazing harmonies (do's, ah's, ba's, la's) all layered on top of each other - usually starting from something Hank or Manny says. Quite inventive and it suits perfectly. The ending is done quite well, with their return from the bush, but you truly feel you've been on a journey with them and feel their friendship. For a directorial debut, the Daniels have done a great job - I look forward to what's next!"
" Great film!

From watching a steel faced Manny fart-propelling through the water, to watching their friendship slowly build, all the way through to the ending I found unexpected sadness, a twinge of hopefulness, a sense of shock, empathy, and last but not least pure enjoyment watching this film.It's different, and a lot of people don't like different, but I absolutely loved this film. 10/10."
" JUST NO

",0.5994,-0.4432,2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"I have never come out of a cinema feeling as confused as I was after Swiss Army Man, but I can genuinely say that it was a good thing. Over the course of 90 minutes I felt disgust, fear, pure joy, confusion amongst every other emotion known to man.Obviously this is not a film for everybody. But if you want to see something that confirms the power of movies, then Swiss Army Man is the way to go. It's heartwarmingly bizarre. For me, this is a perfect film. The music, the acting, the scenery, the story, the feels...everything adds up to something otherworldly and incredible. Just watch it, if you don't like it, at least you've seen a movie unlike anything you've seen before."

""If my best friend hides his farts from me then what else is he hiding from me, and why does that make me feel so alone?"" It may be called as a fart comedy but it's a much deep reflection on life than most films out there. One of the best films of this year."
" There really, REALLY is nothing like this. At all.
",-0.4648,0.9902,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I'm writing this review after re-watching Swiss Army Man, not because I didn't get it the first time out, but because my initial review got wiped when my laptop crashed. Looking back, I think it's fair to say my opinion hasn't changed, but it's much different watching it outside of a cinema.The main thing a lot of people have commented on regarding this movie is the way it makes farts a thematic device to signify character development. I repeat: it makes farts a thematic device to signify character development. This statement alone shows how this movie deserves a certain amount of recognition beyond its weirdness.That being said, this movie certainly embraces its weirdness, but only in the sense of its goes with its premise whole-heartedly and works for it. And what really makes the movie work is the odd-couple relationship between Hank and Manny, played respectively by Paul Dano, whose an extremely underrated actor who shows here to be playing the gambit from suicidal to overjoyed, from loneliness to wholeness, with drama and comedy, and also Manny the farting corpse, who is played to Oscar calibre standard by Daniel Radcliffe - what? If an actor like Eddie Redmayne can win for what he did in Theory of Everything, a physically demanding part, why not Radcliffe for the way he has to move completely unnaturally, but also show emotional growth beyond the simple gimmick of the character's one-line description? Seriously though, this is some of the best work Radcliffe has and will ever do: Manny is kind of like Jeff Bridges' portrayal of Starman, in that he is a mystical, magical kind of presence and it is endearing to watch him learn, but he also paces the dialogue amazingly. For instance, his retorts to Hank about masturbation become a sweet monologue about the same thing later on.That's the biggest draw about this movie - the amount of heart shown in both its direction, its score, its effects on Manny as he's used for a wide variety of purposes and uses, and the way it builds to a moment that should on paper be dumb - Hank shows he's not afraid to fart in public, Manny becomes revived and Hank says something to him, maybe ""thank you for saving me"" but I don't know, and they exchange one last smile as he farts out to sea - into a moment of real-touching cinema.OBVIOUSLY, this film isn't for everyone. If you can accept what's happening, and suspend disbelief, this is a rewarding viewing experience."
" Suspend your disbelief and enjoy an absurd and acutely observant movie.
",0.2263,0.9739,2017-10-30 00:00:00,9,"Any movie this polarizing must be interesting, and its overall review and awards seem to bear that out. In a nutshell, a suspension of disbelief is essential for this movie, which allows the incredibly creative canvas The Daniels built to sink in. The plot is an exploration of the reality of existence, isolation, sex and desire, death, and survival. That it's done with slapstick, lowbrow and black comedy engages the open-minded viewer, and if you're not easily offended, it never bores or loses interest. I found myself laughing frequently, not at the easy gas jokes, but at the acerbic and observational situations presented, and the character's unlikely reactions to them; there is a level of intelligent insight that wouldn't work in a realistic film. Both actors do great work in a difficult environment, but Radcliffe really hits a home run with his portrayal, both physically and emotionally; I'm impressed that he would choose a movie like this, and that he threw himself so fully into the role. That last comment goes for both actors, because without their level of commitment to their roles this movie could have easily been a failure. Kudos to the studio, directors and actors."

",-0.3182,0.9645,2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"It's hard to say what this movie is about, but it's certainly thought provoking. Is it about a loser lost in the woods who finds a super- powered undead guy? Is it about a guy who hangs himself, and the visions he has as he dies? Is it about a mans hallucinations, when he goes insane from never having been loved?I don't know, but I do know that the acting is amazing, the soundtrack awesome, and the set dressing lovely. The ending wont give you any answers, which might be the low point of the movie, and the toilet humor might not be for everyone, but otherwise I recommend it."

Cringeworthy humour. Pointless plot. Dreadful script. Boring characters. Daniel Radcliffe. Everything about this film is insufferable and I can't quite believe there are people out there who not only endured it, but actually enjoyed it.'Swiss Army Man' is basically a screen adaptation of a cheap, crude joke book. The biggest joke is how it has achieved an average score of 7 out of 10 on IMDb. Who is voting, a bunch of 6 year olds? Any fully grown adult who actually laughed at the infantile 'humour' in this film needs to have a word with themselves.I would have given 'Swiss Army Man' a 0 if I could and it's definitely my nomination for the worst film of 2016. How can this trash possibly pass as entertainment?"
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.9794,2017-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Watching this film was not of my interest since summary seemed ridiculous waste of time. But I saw good reviews and I decided to watch it. I could not make it to the end. It was horrendous. It was deeply annoying and I stopped watching it. It was a waste of Daniel Radcliffe's talent. OK he tries super hard to distinguish himself from the Harry Potter character. But why on earth would he play the role of a farting rotting corpse which is manipulated by a suicidal , depressed, schizophrenic , necrophiliac person, I do not understand this. I think that this movie was meant to be a parody, or a social experiment. I think the person who was behind all this said, hey let's do an experiment. Let's create a horrible movie, with a horrible plot and put a famous actor in it. Let's see how many people will be willing to watch our horrendous creation and what will they conclude. This was not a movie. This was a nerve breaking, annoying parody. But somehow it worked for some people because the ratings are 7 stars and above. I believe honestly that those who rated this movie well were either out of their minds, they were either trying to justify what they just saw by thinking that it had an allegoric deeper meaning, or much more possible they were sponsored to write a good review. There can not be any other explanation. What did I just watch?"
" Digging deep
",0.0,0.9917,2017-09-12 00:00:00,7,"First of all, this is my first review and English isn't my mother tongue, so please forgive the grammatical errors.I know: everyone has an opinion to everything and I usually don't like spreading mine around, while not many are interested in it anyways. But isn't this, what the whole movie is about? Letting it all out...? I just felt obligated to write something about it, because this movie managed something not a lot of movies or books or TV-series managed to do to me in recent times: Really think about it.It is not just another movie you watch, enjoy a few entertaining scenes, talk one or two minutes about it afterwards and then just forget about ... letting it sink back into oblivion. The ending made me wanting to learn more about it, made me wanting to read other opinions about it... And that's also what I especially liked: There isn't just one clear resolution. The movie can be interpreted in many different ways...But I guess one isn't usually watching a movie just to interpret it in different ways afterwards. One is watching a movie to experience something new, to become caught up in a different world, to be entertained and at best to be touched emotionally.I think the movie complies with all these points but I ""only"" could give it 7 points because I felt that the movie was a bit repetitive at some points and prolonged unnecessarily at others.But still, the actors where great: I never thought much of Daniel Radcliff but despite his difficult character, a corpse, he made me feel sympathy for him...Altogether: A very special movie (and even though it really IS so special, I never got the impression it was forced), a big plus point for creativity, music and actors (just two actors for the most part of the film, but never got bored of their faces or anything)and definitely worth a watch."

" Heart-Warming and Indescribably Strange Tale of a Man and a Corpse
",-0.6705,0.863,2017-09-11 00:00:00,6,"If ever there was a movie that's difficult to recommend, or even describe, to someone who hasn't seen it, it's SWISS ARMY MAN. It's a comedy of sorts. You could probably even call it a romantic comedy. Or maybe it's more ""bromantic"" comedy. It's never made entirely clear what the relationship is between Paul Dano's Hank and the corpse he befriends (Daniel Radcliffe) when stranded on a diminutive island. Hank discovers the dead man, named Manny, when he washes ashore on the island where Hank's been surviving since whatever shipwreck left him there. Manny saves Hank's life; Hank was about to hang himself when Manny came along with his rocket-propelling flatulence. Hank is able to ride Manny like a jet ski back to the mainland. Little by little, Hank discovers there's more to Manny than one might believe. Aside from rocket flatulence, he's capable of vomiting up an apparent limitless reservoir of fresh water, directing them home with his dowsing rod erection, and hyper-powered karate chop action. Manny has essentially returned to pseudo-life, but he's still a corpse and he has no memory of anything from life. Right down to the basics. As Hank and Manny traverse the wilderness from the shore to civilization, Hank passes the time by explaining life and living, going so far as to build elaborate props so Manny can experience life himself. So if the premise of a miserable soul finding personal connection with a dead man with explosive gas sounds appealing, there you are.Obviously, SWISS ARMY MAN is a tough sell to the mainstream audience. The strange combination of the movie's juvenile humor with the heartfelt relationship at its core can be a rough watch for some. The movie kept bouncing between these two tones and I was generally annoyed with it. A sudden shift out of a touching moment of Manny rediscovering life with an erection joke cheapens the scene and lessens its impact (for me), and the reverse is just as aggravating because the stupid humor is the more entertaining part and I realize I would've been more content to watch an entire movie of Hank and Manny's adventures without, you know, the less interesting relationship element. The tonal shifts and the overly sappy life moments meant I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hope to. I was excited for this movie because an insane premise like that deserves a chance and, while I'd recommend anyone watch this movie and decide for themselves, it wouldn't be an enthusiastic recommendation. The performances give it a little extra something. Paul Dano is a great actor and kills it as the pathetic soul Hank as he finds someone who cares about him, even if that person is a corpse. Daniel Radcliffe must've been eager to reinforce that he'd moved on since Harry Potter because Manny is just about the strangest possible role he could've taken. And you know what? He's actually really, really good. Manny is the juicier role and he nails it.Dano and Radcliffe have a great chemistry, which is good since they are 95% of the movie until the last 5-10 minutes or so. This movie is very much two men wandering through the wilderness as one teaches the other about life and existence through the use of props and setpieces made from scraps and garbage. If nothing else, I can say SWISS ARMY MAN is the most creative film I've seen this year. I know it wasn't really the focus of the film and all but I would've loved a bit more explanation on what exactly the deal with Manny was. I started the movie believing him to be a manifestation of Hank's starved/sun-baked mind but he's able to interact with his environment and even speaks to one other person by the end. So if he's a real talking corpse, why hide his powers from everyone but Hank? And where does a talking corpse come from? Is he the only one? Am I over-thinking it? Yes. Because I was more interested in what Manny's deal was than the personal journey of these characters. I might not be the best person to give a recommendation on whether to watch this or not because obviously I walked away from it with a complete different focus than what was intended by the filmmakers.

" Not everything that's bitter is medicine. Some is s**t.
",0.3252,-0.9735,2017-09-05 00:00:00,1,"Dear person reading this, I am writing this so that those who see this review may know that there are still other sane people out there and the world isn't as hopeless and doomed as the people praising this dumpster fire make it seem. Other movies only manage to be worse if they cater to the gross- horror / torture porn crowd. They thus usually limit themselves in scope and audience, and thus damage potential, to people who are willing to watch such movies.So while it is not aggressively trying to hurt the viewer, this movie is still absolutely awful in that it first appears to be ""just weird"", while in actuality possibly being the worst high profile movie mankind has ever produced, certainly on par with Tusk and co.The movie lacks any redeeming qualities. The story is vapid, the score at best disturbing and fittingly nauseating, the setting atrocious, the visuals bland, the message non-existent. While good actors might have saved other movies, this one was so bad that the actors are tainted by it instead. The lead, Dano, was trying his best, and has a sympathetic face, but i will probably never be able to watch anything from him or Radcliffe ever again, because of the association with this movie.This movie is merely trying to assault the viewer's senses, hoping that in the confusion the poor victim will be unable to differentiate the uneasy feeling of seeing revolting things from the feeling of having profound wisdom revealed to them. Well the emperor has no clothes as others have said. There is absolutely nothing profound about this movie.I have only spoilered this review with the mentally handicapped audience in mind, but most of the ending is already revealed if one looks close enough at the trailer: The talking corpse of infinite farts, water, and machine gun skills in an otherwise realistic world cannot possibly be realistic. So it's not really a plot twist as it is clear from the trailer on. And that's about it. This is basically the profound wisdom everyone is talking about. Ooooh the supernatural corpse isn't a real thing, he only imagines it living, so the things the corpse does only come from his imagination! What a stellar metaphor for random things about life! It's just one step away from actually having the main character just talk to himself about his problems throughout the whole movie. The values people ascribe to the movie are just not present no matter how positively i try to look at things. Statement about modern life? Where? A critique of what is and isn't acceptable? So are you saying your profound wisdom is that constant talk about masturbation and random private bodily functions in company should be commonplace? A cautionary tale against intolerance in general? Does that include the scene of the bible being smeared with feces for shock value?Here is a tip for all the people who would go on and give this movie any rating above 5 stars: Instead of buying this movie, the next time you use the toilet, don't flush and put your head into it for 97 minutes while pretending that it is a symbolic gesture about the stink of the modern, industrial, densely populated world, the value that individuals produce being independent of societal norms, and the conditions of our fellow man. You will get the same nauseating disgust and smug self-satisfaction as you would from watching this abomination and then pretending that a movie made explicitly to ""make unpalatable things palatable"" carried a deep message for you.""Artist's Sh*t"" (mierda de l'artista) as an art piece at least had value in that it was self aware and meta in criticizing its own future. This movie completely lacks self awareness, and is nonetheless - bar a few good cinematic moves - essentially of the same content as the previously mentioned work of art."
" Worse movie ever
",-0.4767,-0.9635,2017-09-03 00:00:00,1,Definitely the worse movie I have ever watched. The acting was poor and the plot completely absurd ! I really got my hopes high when reading comments from other viewers but was incredibly disappointed when I finished watching that movie. Honestly the first few minutes gives you the flavor for the rest of the movie: a man riding a dead body propelled by farting is really gross and idiotic. I still wonder how I made it to the end.

Hank creates a menagerie with the trash and has long conversations about life, love, and relationships with Manny...clearly an extension of himself.This is another ""Emperor has no clothes film"" which people say they like to look cool and intellectual. It was painfully boring. I believed the film was (and still could be) extensional as Hank was in the process of killing himself and nothing made any sense. The dialogue was pseudo insightful and certainly not entertaining. More entertaining than the Redford boat film, but not as good as Tom Hanks' island. A mediocre attempt at cute and clever."

" A rather confusing movie...
",-0.2263,0.9369,2017-08-14 00:00:00,5,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie, and all I knew about it was that it was about a man marooned and that Daniel Radcliffe played a dead man who washed up on the beach.This is definitely one of the weirder movies that I have watched in quite some time. And at times it was so far out there that is stopped being funny and it felt like directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert just took it too far.The acting in the movie was good, despite it being a very small cast. And both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe performed quite well with their given roles. And they had to perform quite well in order to carry the movie, as they were alone on the screen most of the entire movie. I must say that especially Paul Dano was shining here, because he went all in for this particular role. I think it was a very bald choice of a movie and a character for Daniel Radcliffe, but it was a very nice change of pace to watch him in a movie as odd as ""Swiss Army Man"" turned out to be.There were some pretty hilarious moments throughout the course of the movie between the Hank (played by Paul Dano) and Manny (played by Daniel Radcliffe) characters.However, I must admit that I didn't really understand the story. It was entertaining, but I don't think I really grasped the full concept of the story that writers Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan had at heart here. It was somewhat confusing and seemed to become a scrambled mess of even more confusion towards the end when they finally found civilization.Despite having some very hilarious moments, then ""Swiss Army Man"" is hardly a movie that warrants a second viewing."

You can still disappear into the sea, take off to the unknown where you can be yourself. Where you can be free.The film is oddly refreshing, liberating and hopeful. i don't want to analyze the ""true story"" behind this film. Anyone can imagine what is truly happening in Hank's mind. So what? Does it really matter? Sometimes reality doesn't matter. Sometimes imagination leaves you breathless, speechless and sometimes you 're the only one who matters. While the others are saying ""WTF?"" to what you just showed them, set your hidden self free, away from the barriers they put around him. For me, Manny represents the true happiness in life. Happiness one can find in silly things, ""inappropriate"" things. ""Insane"" things. His ability to go away using his own super powers is so liberating, it had me smiling honestly to myself, feeling free and powerful. I think the true question throughout the movie is: ""Is Manny real?""Well, what if he is?"
" Rating: A-
",0.0,0.9917,2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"I'm not going to hold it in any longer, I loved this film! It's extremely well directed, super original, DIFFERENT and WEIRD. It has an amazing score that makes every scene so much better and a team of actors with their best performances so far. The directors constantly used childish and embarrassing things to talk about in public (farting, masturbation, etc) as metaphors to some of the most profound life lessons that I've ever heard.There are so many scenes that I'll remember for a long time because they were so deep and true: there are a couple of scenes where Manny, who lost his memories and wanted to learn everything about life, asks Hank, who's partially using and deceiving Manny in order to return home,  why he wants to go back if they can't do anything? Why would he go back home if he has to hold in his farts and can't say what he wants to say? Because, in our world, that's rude, obscene ... And also a lie. This film points out so many moments of our lives that, when we think about it, they're so true that we don't even realize how often we do them. If I had to rate this movie in terms of inspiration and life motivation scenes, I give it an A+ straight away.Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano have their best performances ever. The Harry Potter movies' kid is amazing and Dano is at the same level. They're hilarious and that's something I almost forgot to say: this movie is FUNNY! The humor is extremely good and there are so many scenes that just let me in tears of so much laughing. They transformed what could've been a B drama (and even boring) movie into a captivating film filled with life stories that we can all relate to.The end of the movie doesn't really make sense to me and that's really my only main complaint about this film. Analyzing the movie from the beginning, as I put the pieces of the puzzle together, the ending doesn't appear to fit in with the rest of the story. I can understand what the directors were going for, but unfortunately, I don't think they were able to do it perfectly.Still, Swiss Army Man wins the award for the Weirdest Movie of the Year with an astounding team of directors, actors and an epic score that I'm not going to forget that fast!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" A Relentlessy Wacky Buddy Movie
",0.0,0.9888,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"A suicidal man named Hank is stranded on a lonely island. There he meets the corpse Manny who's suffering from terrible flatulence. Hank uses the dead body and its farts to cross the ocean. (Don't ask.) They reach a jungle, where a struggle for survival begins. Hank realizes that Manny is kinda like a human Swiss army knife. He uses him as a hunting weapon, a grapple and a compass. (Yeah. Don't ask.) But Manny only functions when he gets motivated properly. So the world-worn Hank needs to teach the corpse how beautiful life actually is.Yes. This seriously is the plot of ""Swiss Army Man"", an off-kilter and juvenile adventure movie full of fart and masturbation jokes. The two directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan (""Daniels"") display a crude humor, which definitively isn't for everyone. But if you give this movie a chance and make it through the clunky first act, you might realize that the plot has more to offer than just trash madness. It's actually a rather sad story about a depressed and lonely young man trying to find himself. There are some really inspiring and beautiful montages, that are technically impressive as well.The relationship between Hank and Manny is the heart of this movie. The two leads have an amazing chemistry going on. Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") is very relatable, because he is just as astonished about the strange circumstances as the audience is. Daniel Radcliffe (""Harry Potter"") has an impeccable comedic timing: His Manny is one of the funniest characters I have seen in a long time. The relationship between Hank and Manny lends itself to interpretation: Are they friends, a homosexual couple or ego and alter ego? But of course you shouldn't overthink ""Swiss Army Man"", because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie ends with a flabbergasted Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") whispering: ""What the f***?"" Great question.""Swiss Army Man"" is a featherbrained, philosophical, absurd and beautiful buddy movie. Bear with the unrefined beginning and you'll get rewarded with big laughs and small insights."
" Radcliffe great, the rest of the movie not so much....
",0.6249,-0.55,2017-08-01 00:00:00,6,"The bizarre but semi-boring independent movie ""Swiss Army Man"" was not as multi-useful as I thought it was gonna be. In this swiss cheesy flick, Paul Dano stars as Hank; who is stranded in a deserted island and about to commit suicide. But before you take out your hankies for Hank, let me inform you (not spoiler alert, its in the trailer) as he is about to commit the suicidal act, he sees a dead man stranded on the shore of the island beach; this man is called Manny. Hank tries to resuscitate Manny, but to no avail. Then Manny starts to have some gaseous combustion that farts him back to life. OK, that is where I said, maybe this ""Swiss Army Man"" did not switch it up for me. The film was written and directed by a couple of Dans; Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert; and though I credit the Dans for their effort in the originality of the premise, I do have to say that they did not insert enough pizazz to liven up the ""Swiss Army Man"" for me. I do have to credit the film's score and the stupendous performance from Daniel Radcliffe as Manny. I don't know what kind of ""potter"" Radcliffe was on (Potter pun intended), but I must state that his performance was revolutionary. However, it was still not enough for me to recommend for you to visit the ""Swiss Army Man"". *** Average"
" Confusion of a masterpiece

Normally, I wouldn't have like the kind of humour pictured in this movie but everything from the atmosphere, the sequence... leave you speechless and thinking.Through the whole movie, you ask yourself questions and rediscover life and the meaning of our lives in society. At the beginning, it seemed like a crappy dumb movie but that's probably one of the best movie I have seen so far with truths hidden deep inside."

I took a sick day today and wanted to watch a simple movie just to pass the time and kill the boredom of staying in bed... After 5 minutes I knew that this is not that type of movie at all... but the movie does not let you let it go. It's a movie that cannot be left unfinished...It has something to say...It speaks to everyone all through...from the start to the end. It makes you wonder just like the main character in a field with all the familiar terrains but alien and unknown at the same time...all throughout the movie I could not believe that the movie is this good and I expected a cliché to pop up eventually and the movie falls off from its ascent but that never happened and the movie takes you to exactly where it wanted to...to a place that you could never have imagined! I watched so many bad movies this year that such a unique movie gave a huge pleasure, even though coming from a farting dead corpse I call this movie a fresh perspective!"
" I Turned It Off!
",0.0,-0.9214,2017-06-29 00:00:00,2,"(Flash Review)I think Radcliffe's role choices have become very demented. This is the seconds movie of his I turned off; Horns was the other. I think growing up as Harry Potter has messed him up. In Horns, his character grew actual horns from his head and the movie was simply mean-spirited. In Swiss Army Man, Radcliffe is a corps that has washed up on shore. Dano's character, who is stranded on a dessert island and about to hang himself, sees the corps and runs to it. The movie becomes surreal as he forms a relationship with the dead corps. So much so, he talks with it and it talks back. Like a dark and twisted version of Cast Away with Tom Hanks. Their interactions are about the most stupid, pointless and gross topics. I guess this is a comedy as there are a slew of awkward potty jokes that get draaaaaaged out to the point of irritation. Avoid! 2 points for the production team."

I wasn't at all sure what to expect, but because of Radcliffe and Dano, I decided to give it a try.It's inspired.If your'e going to watch it for a comedy, then don't (although it has many funny moments). If your'e going to watch it for a mystery, then don't (although it is truly mysterious). If your'e going to watch it for its foresight into the many aspects of the human conditioning about what we perceive as wrong, right or otherwise in situations of day to day life - then expect a real eye opener in a way you may never have dreamed possible.I'm genuinely surprised that it has received the high rating it has, because I suspect many viewers will find it baffling, boring, or simply disgusting. Some maybe will think it's all three.Thankfully however, the world has many different people with many different tastes, and even more thankfully there are people out there making movies that are so different that there really is something out there for everyone.This ones for me and hopefully, for some other like-minded individuals.Wonderful."
" ""If you don't know Jurassic Park, you don't know s***!""
",0.0,0.0758,2017-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Better known as the ""farty boner corpse"" movie, this is a strange, funny and surprisingly heartwarming buddy comedy starring Paul Dano as Hank, a depressed man whose suicide attempt is interrupted by a corpse that washes ashore. Hank uses the corpse, which he dubs Manny (a very good Daniel Radcliffe) to escape his desert island and return home. The movie makes a strong argument that the smartphone- addicted culture of the 2010's is turning too many of us into people like Hank, a man who is ashamed of his eccentricities, oddities and everything else that social media allows us to mask all too easily. During his travels with Manny, who exhibits everything disgusting about human beings, he learns to not be embarrassed of his abnormalities, because when it comes down to it, humans are pretty weird by design. The movie has been compared to everything from Cast Away to Weekend at Bernie's to Where the Wild Things Are, but the comparison that makes the most sense to me is Rain Man. In that movie, Charlie regains the humanity that Reaganomics stole from him, and in this one, Hank regains the humanity that smartphone culture told him to revile. While its life-affirming message it shares with some of the other movies I mentioned is not terribly original, the odd, disgusting and definitely unique journey Hank and Manny go on is still worth joining."

The two main leads give a great performance, specially Daniel Radcliffe who plays Manny, the dead body.This movie perfectly uses comedy to say some very important things about being ourselves and letting things (farts) out.The score was also amazing, it was composed mainly by the two actors humming, but it was pretty good. I actually downloaded it on Spotify.The whole idea of the film is ridiculous, and it is very original. You really can't compare anything to this movie. So it is very hard to review it.The only negative I have with the movie is the ending, which I really liked. But there were some things that didn't add up.

Got too bored to care after the aforementioned 40 minutes. I like some weird stuff, but this wasn't suited to my taste at all.

I wont describe the plot cause it will probably put you off, just trust me, this film is amazing. First of all Swiss Army Man is one of the most beautiful looking movies i've ever seen. Its just so gorgeous, every shot was a treat to look at. Another amazing thing was the score. It fitted the film perfectly and is so full of energy and joy, just like the film its self. Probably the best part of the movie though were the two leads. I'm a big fan of movies with small casts and Swiss Army Man only has two character who are both incredible well performed by Paul Dano and Danial Radcliffe who are both excellent. Its also really funny and parts will have you laughing like hell but other parts will have you on the verge of crying. The humor is so well done, It takes jokes that will usually make people cringe and feel dumb and nothing more, and with amazing writing become incredibly funny and relatable. Swiss Army Man gets everything right that a movie can and yet some people seem to hate it. I really don't understand why people dislike this movie, I think it's completely perfect in every way but that's just my opinion."

The buzz was strong throughout the 2016 festival season. Unfortunately, it took until spring 2017 before it was actually available for me to view. And it was worth it.I will say hat it was not as funny as I thought it would be. The movie is funny, but not purely so. There are more than a few emotional moments mixed in about what it means to be human and alone. This might make it a better more well-rounded film, but i would have preferred the straight humor."

But when a movie doesn't make any sense at all then I get bored, in this case really bored. I'll give it a three star rating just for the fart jokes, because fart jokes are always funny. For the rest the story-line is just weird and most of the time ridiculous. But not ridiculous in a funny way. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe didn't act bad or so, it's just the story that is bad. I honestly don't get why this movie gets such a high rating on here. I saw so much better movies with a lower score that sometimes I wonder how we can all be so different when it's about taste.

You can smell, I mean tell by watching. Seriously though, the movie does not run out of ... fumes. You know it's easy making even more jokes, but the movie itself or the filmmakers are serious about being funny and inventive at the same time.Having former Harry Potter in a, well passive role like this is amazing. He tries and in this case succeeds shedding the shell of the magician others put on him (yes you can also say hood). On the other hand the things being done here can feel like magic too. The movie is pretty insane and weird and very much out there. I guess you can compare it with Cast Away (the Tom Hanks movie) and Radcliffes character to Mr. Wilson in that movie.I think the filmmakers did a great job and it's not only borderline crazy but also genius. If you like weird and unexpected than this is for you. I also love the fact that even at the ending, when you think ""ok the movie finally faltered"", it pulls an ace (or something with two ""s"") out of its ... well enough of the jokes. Let's just say I can highly recommend this movie"
" Strange, strange and a bit more strange
",-0.5267,0.4949,2017-04-11 00:00:00,5,"Swiss Army Man is a vehicle that doesn't carry its own weight through to the end. There's a definite failure to realize when the audiences' suspension of disbelief is at breaking point. Several times metaphors went so far down the wrong paths, it was like they couldn't find their way back again.There were ample opportunities to make this a decent film. The way it was told through a lonely, suicidal young man eyes, and telling his story of rebirth through the use of a corpse was unique. Watching him claw himself back from the depths of madness by conversing with the dead man could have worked, and definitely gave them license to include a lot of those VERY strange activities. But in the end it didn't come together. I didn't get the sexual angle at all. Was he a repressed gay man? Was that his whole confusion throughout the movie? What was it about the word retarded that was supposed to be so hurtful to him? It wasn't explored at all. I often have trouble grasping some movie metaphors and often miss important or significant events which makes the whole experience less engaging. Sometimes I have to read other reviews to get the plot intricacies. But I think Swiss Army Man just fails to deliver a coherent plot. They wanted to have their cake and eat it too by continuing with the fantasy angle well after reality should have kicked in.I was positively pacing and hoping Swiss Army Man would end for the last 10 minutes. If I hadn't invested so much time I would have shut it down after Hank emerged from the 'wilderness'. But I clung to the hope the Director would pull something clever out to the box and wrap it up with some sort of logic. They chose to go with more fart jokes and pure fantasy. It felt like they just kept on tacking more and more scenes on well after it was time to call a wrap.Might be good for stoners. Left me feeling flat and weirded out."
" The one with the farting dead body
",-0.6486,-0.2037,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"""Swiss Army Man"" opens with a shot of an exasperated Hank (Paul Dano) preparing to hang himself on a deserted island. Bored, alone and without hope, a look of astonishment surfaces on Hank's face as a body (Daniel Radcliffe) washes up on shore before his impending suicide.Desperately searching the body, Hank soon discovers that it is without life and is very flatulent. Through a series of odd and spectacular events, the body comes to life and the two go on a ""road trip"" of epic proportions to get Hank back home.The score for this film, while simplistic, is by far the most inventive I've heard in years. Directors Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert and cinematographer Larken Seiple craft captivating visuals, and Daniel Radcliffe gives his best performance since ""Harry Potter.""Deemed the ""farting dead body movie"" at this year's Sundance Film Festival, there were many who loved ""Swiss Army Man,"" and there were many who walked out of it. While not aimed for the casual moviegoer, underneath the surface-level absurdity of this film can be found relevant themes, genuine characters and a heart-felt story."
" This is a weird movie...
",-0.1779,0.7086,2017-03-27 00:00:00,5,"Someone mentioned that you either love it or hate it. Not true. I certainly didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. It did make me laugh a couple of times, but not enough to call it a comedy. There wasn't enough adventure to call is an adventure either, nor enough drama to call it a drama. So what is it then? Well, I think the word 'weird' was invented to characterize something like this. I remember watching another weird movie a couple of weeks ago, called ""Lobster"". OK, I admit that was a whole lot weirder than this one. But maybe people who like Lobster may appreciate this movie. As for me... neh. Did I enjoy it? Maybe a little bit. Is it a good movie? No. Is it a bad one? No, that would be too negative. I won't go so far as to call it a ""waste of time"", but if I had know upfront what kind of movie it was, I probably wouldn't have watched it."
" Hell of a directorial debut for Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan
",-0.6808,0.9953,2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Swiss Army Man is a wild, immature, self-aware, mature, intellectual, uncomfortable, hilarious ride. Yes, I purposely put those contradictory words in there. It's for those reasons that long after seeing Swiss Army Man, I am still breaking down everything I watched.It's a weird, but seemingly basic (see: traditional, as there isn't much ""basic"" about being stranded) premise of a man being lost and trying to find his way back home. As we find out, home is not that simple, and it turns out that things can get weird when corpses come back to life. Paul Dano (Hank) and Daniel Radcliffe (Manny) are cast perfectly for this film. However, it's the writing and directing team of Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan that I wanted to focus on. I think the writing in the film is really good. It preserves a lot of mystery without taking over the story. The audience remains curious about certain aspects of the film, but not enough that it takes away from their enjoyment of scenes like the party that Hank and Manny have together. The direction was really solid too. Other than the beautiful use of natural light and incorporation of the environment, I thought the sparing use of slow motion was a really nice touch. Overall, I really can't wait to see what this duo takes on for their next feature length project. If you don't mind a lot of fart jokes, you should definitely check this out! Actually, even if you do, because I still think it's worth it. The farting didn't do too much for me either, and look at how much I enjoyed the whole thing!"
" About love, friendship and flarts
",0.7964,0.9606,2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"The great thing about this movie is that it's playing all the time with what's real and what's' not. Through the story we notice that we will never know but it doesn't matter. The important thing is its lessons mainly about accept your weirdness and each other weirdness. I know it sounds cliché but what makes a huge plot is take a cliché statement and valid it through dialogues, metaphors and situations so the the viewer understand the true meaning of something the sounds vague. This is exactly what Swiss Army Man does. At the end the movie play a big joke on us. It is real close to reality for the first time and we are very comfortable with it until it slap our faces and give us the biggest lesson of all."
" Learning how to live by hanging with a dead guy...
",-0.6486,0.998,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Imagine the pitch: What if, on the eve of deciding you must take your own life in a remote location, you see a random dead guy washed up on the shore and, through a series of exercises in human physiognomy, including chronic flatulence and tumescence, the corpse (or zombie?) becomes your friend, teaching you how to live a more fulfilling life? Cheers to the studio(s) that funded this fun, clever, gross, touching and very dark comedy/bromance, and here's hoping discerning, intelligent movie audiences can continue to get more quality films that push envelopes the way this one does.Taking a cue from the old story ""Teig O'Kane and the Corpse,"" ""Swiss Army Man"" spends much of it's running time creating a relationship between someone at the end of his rope and someone who has passed the end of his rope, as our hero drags and carries around his talking cadaver pal. The conversations that take place between the living character played by Paul Dano and his new, deceased companion played by Daniel Radcliffe, include ruminations on growing up ashamed of your body and bodily functions and how it can translate into a broken sense of ego, destroying your ability to love and be loved. In fact, there's a possibility (spoiler here, perhaps) that all of this is merely a projection played out in the head of our hero. I don't think it is though; the fact that ""evidence"" is captured on video at the conclusion of this story suggests that the whole thing really was supposed to be taking place in the ""real world,"" which makes the film a kind of dark fairy tale. I'm reminded of Todd Solondz' ""Palindromes,"" which also (successfully) found whimsy in topics that are generally thought of in polite society as being taboo.There is a lot of whimsy here...Dano's ""Hank"" exerts a great deal of energy to try to convince Radcliffe's ""Manny"" (or perhaps himself) of the importance of loving yourself and then others, while utilizing piles of junk to recreate scenes in real life (a cinema, a bus ride) that would make the castaways of Gilligan's Island proud (and the film has many such fun and familiar references to other works). The elaborate set-ups and the clever way this business is filmed reminds one of the work of Michel Gondry (and, unfortunately, sometimes succumbs to the same kind of preciousness Gondry's work suffers from) but is a feast for the eyes.So too is the work of Radcliffe--what a dream it must be to be able to take on roles like this after the tedium of the Harry Potter films, and you can tell Radcliffe is having a great time. With his gravelly, stroke-victim speaking style and childish questions he creates a character something in-between the child robot in ""AI"" and Peter Falk. He jumps in with his entire (broken) body and goes places a lot of actors wouldn't have the (literal) guts to go. In fact, much of the enjoyment of the film (if that's what it is) is the focus on the flesh, guts and bones of ""Manny's"" dead body in all its repulsive, eruptive glory and it's hard to take your eyes off his fascinating, distorted face. David Cronenberg probably wishes he made this one. Dano is also fun to watch and gives a compassionate, touching, near-pathetic performance that veers just on the edge of going too far into child-like slapstick.The film is far from perfect...the ending drags and one senses the filmmakers spent a great deal of time trying to outsmart today's sharp and literal-minded audiences. I found the ending satisfying but that's because I didn't have any expectations by that point. If the film had ended (spoiler again) in the ""real world,"" it would have been awfully depressing but would probably have been more true to the set up. As it is, the ending fits into the ""anything goes"" premise set up earlier on.There's also the ""precious/cute"" quality, the glorification of vulgar bodily function gags, long stretches that push credibility and a score that sometimes enthralls but often as not irritates. Clearly part of the reason this movie was made was to showcase digital effects but the effects work is sometimes a bit cheap looking (but I'm in the FX industry so maybe more critical).But overall this is an original, engaging and well-produced piece of cinema that is meant for a specific type of audience. It's likely to irritate people who expected a mainstream comedy (to which I would query, did you watch the trailer? What were you expecting?), people who want Radcliffe to stay Harry Potter and people who are insecure with their sexuality (the film bravely crosses a line into glorification of two men experimenting with each other physically, hinting at necrophilia, as well as focusing on Mr. Radcliffe's bare derriere several times). But for the rest of us, who like films that challenge while entertaining, that offer shocks that exist for more than just shock value and are visually fulfilling, this film is a rare treat. It's free on Amazon right now, if you're at all intrigued, check it out while you can...it's a brisk, zippy little film that, even if you hate it, will probably stick with you, which is more than I can say for any of the endless Harry Potter films."
" Profoundly bizarre, philosophical fantasy adventure has some substance but perhaps is a little clumsy for it's own good
",0.5927,0.994,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"This part-buddy comedy, part-fantasy adventure is one of those rare cinematic entries that is destined to leave moviegoers with the question ""what kind of drugs were these filmmakers on?"". It is a movie that is astoundingly original and almost entirely divorced to the typical cinematic conventions of any genre. In other words, it almost feels like a large smorgasbord of nearly every genre mixed together. Pushing the boundaries of absurdity and gross-out humor, this movie homes a story of a friendship that is profoundly easy to call ""unlike anything we've seen before"", and this is not an exaggeration. How can a young man form a relationship with a dead body without it coming as horrifying or just plain creepy? This question is answered in this absurd adventure orchestrated by directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert in their feature film debut. This film follows Hank (played by Paul Dano), a scruffy young man stranded on island for reasons never fully explained. When all hope seems lost, Hank ties a rope around his in attempt to commit suicide. He is soon stopped by the sight of a corpse (played by Daniel Radcliffe) washed up on shore. The corpse begins flatulating like crazy. Upon interacting with this discolored dead body, Hank discovers that the body has special powers including one that allows Hank to ride him across the sea like a jet ski with his flatulence propelling him. As he forms a bond with the body, the blooming friendship slowly regenerates the body to life. What transpires is a quest to return to civilization.Yes! This movie is far more peculiar than it sounds, and it is powerfully aware of how deeply bizarre it is. But beneath the abundance amount of fart jokes and envelop-pushing gross-out humor involving sex and masturbation is a surprisingly thoughtful journey about human emotions and the uncompromising power of friendship. The central figure of the story is the friendship between a young man and a dead man who gradually awakens from the grave, questioning various aspects of life and death. With the topics of conversations ranging from why are people embarrassed of farting in front of others, to why sexual intercourse fun, to what is love; the characters' bond transpires to a plethora of vastly awkward, yet hilarious conversations with dialogue that normally comes off as vile and off-putting in most movies. Here, the dialogue translates into something thoughtful, a valuable message about being afraid of other judging you for being different. The humor however, can occasionally falls flat and at times, veers into areas to absurd even for the already bizarre content (one of the story elements involves an erection). The movie hammers on plenty of material that can make some deeply uncomfortable or even appalled. Beneath it all is a little, but clumsily addressed philosophy about how people must learn to function in society regardless of how weird they are. As the two learn, everybody is strange in one way or another.The central cast of the unusual picture is limited to the likes of Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. Dano who's been met with spectacular acclaim for his role in the Oscar-winning historical drama '12 Years A Slave' and the critically praised biopic 'Love & Mercy', cashes in a clean-cut performance is that the lead character trying to find love and hope in a world inhabited with nobody but an unusual corpse with mysterious powers. Working on his side is Daniel Radcliffe. With his days as Harry Potter half-a-decade in the rearview mirror, Radcliffe has explored roles in many areas of the cinematic realm, but none nearly as original and uncanny as this one. Embarking on screen as a dead body lying the on the beach with his eyes half open and skin discolored, his character involves into a live human being which allows him to invest in a potent, yet bizarre performance as an abnormal man with powers that only be described as one-of-a-kind. It is a role that allows him to expand upon his range of humor and human drama. These two play off each other in a series of off-putting dialogue and humor sometimes to weird to describe. The duo of performances come together to form a friendship that is a little clumsily to handle in some areas (especially with the eccentric sense of humor), but preserves a lively sense of love and hope that some can admire. That is if they can move past the quirkiness and the idiosyncratic soundtrack by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell.Swiss Army Man is a considerably entertaining adventure that pushes the envelope of cinematic absurdity in a way that is moderately smart, while falling victim to slightly clumsy execution. Pervasively weird in every turn, this is a movie that will understandably put off some viewers, but at the same time leave others inspired. Those who are able to buy into the eccentric material and occasional vulgarity are the most likely to find the gold in this cinematic entry."
" Worth watching
",0.2263,0.9348,2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"I don't write movie reviews much. That being said I want to say that this movie is well worth watching. As my wife shakes her head and says ""What the heck are you watching?"" I attempt to describe the movie to her, only realizing that it cannot be described without sounding ridiculous. As she turns to leave the room I become more interested in the fate of the characters. This movie generates a feeling of understanding and confusion at the same time. Reading more than the basic description of the movie will tilt your opinion. I gave it an 8 out of 10 which I think is pretty good. Unless you have important chores to do, grab a drink, some snacks, and a blanket then fire up the TV. Quite enjoyable."
" Corpse Pride
",-0.3182,0.9926,2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"Stranded on a desert island, a suicidal young man strikes up a friendship with a corpse that washes ashore after discovering that he can use the cadaver in many ways, like a Swiss army knife, in this offbeat comedy starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. The film is rather slow to warm up, but once Radcliffe's corpse wakes up and starts conversing with Dano, there is nary a dull moment to be had. The humour is very hit-and-miss with the overload of flatulence and erection jokes tiring well before the end, however, there are several genuinely funny moments as the pair converse. It never quite makes sense that Radclifffe remembers certain things about life but has forgotten other elements, however, the best moments of the film come from Dano teaching Radcliffe about social conventions, in turn being given much to think about due to Radcliffe's ignorance about the world at large. ""If my best friend hides his farts from me, then what else is he hiding from me?"" is an especially memorable line. Promising as all this might sound, the film nevertheless exhausts the originality of the premise before it is over. The final few scenes of the movie are pitch perfect with a nice blur between fantasy and reality, but there are a few too many moments of the pair role playing in the woods and not quite enough moments of Dano using Radcliffe's body in creative ways to really justify the title. This is a daringly different sort of comedy for sure, but unless you are really into scatological humour, one's mileage here will almost certainly vary."
" Disappointed. Tedious. But excellent acting.

I'm not a Harry Potter fan, however, I think Danielle Radcliffe is an extremely talented actor with quite the range (Woman in Black, Imperium, Horns...)and his role as a dead guy with a personality was fantastic. Paul Dano did a great job as well. The issue with this film was the GAS (flatulence). While the corpse never ran out of gas the use of that sure did. I'm the type that fins well timed fart extremely funny. I love South Park so it's not like it offended or bothered me in that way. It just became old and stale. And who likes old stale gas? The story itself was clever and unique. It just turned into a Weekend at Bernies meets Castaway meets South Park. The clever use of the corpse for survival, both physical and mental, got lost behind the tediousness of constantly using the flatulence. And they would repeat the way they used it making it even less funny. The emotional drama behind it could have been more, well emotional, if it didn't just become silly. Also compliments to some Great cinematography. I notice a lot of rave reviews and some people definitely got more out of this than I did and I am glad they enjoyed it. You may too."

The TV series Lost is a prime example. For Lost, it was obvious after the 3rd season that it wasn't going to end in any sensible way. This film, however, gave me the sense that with some tweak at the end, it would be worth watching. I was wrong. The ending is worse than the film itself.PS : Those who gave 10-stars are the kind of people who would see an accidental vomit on a canvas, and just because it is on a canvas, would call it ""modern art"" and start adoring it.PPS : The soft soundtrack is nice though."

Crazy fun, right?Yet, the movie is quite cheerless. Yes, there are comedic moments throughout, but there is also a palpable sense of unhappiness.As far as I can tell, the two directors, who have worked on nutty shows like NTSF:SUV, started with a crazy low-comedy idea and then decided to make it profound. The end result attempts to split the difference between pathos and comedy, and for me the end result is something that is a frankly kind of boring.The most interesting part of the movie is the final section in which you learn where its creators were going with this. It's actually pretty thought provoking. But I really didn't enjoy watching this, and if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't."

But then I would have to justify to you what exactly some people would love about it, and I'm not sure I can do that. To be perfectly honest I'm not even entirely sure what I just saw. If this film looks weird in the posters (and trailers I assume, having not actually seen them) then you can be assured it's about 10 times weirder when you actually watch it.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe were the two aspects of the film I actually enjoyed. There's something about Dano I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it. He's the kind of guy you feel like you could be friends with in real life, as apposed to most movie stars who seem like they would be above it. Radcliffe on the other hand, I'm not usually the biggest fan of, although here I was very impressed. I liked his American accent (even with the bizarre line delivery throughout the entire movie) and found that he gave a performance, that can't have been the least bit easy, with a lot of class.I can't recommend 'Swiss Army Man' to be watched. I have no doubt some people will find it quirky and different enough to get some pleasure out of it, but I'm certainly not one of those people."

While there were SOME good movies released, such as Deadpool, Rogue One and more, Swiss Army Man is for sure on the list of great 2016 films. This movie just screams originality, with a story that you cannot compare to others. It makes things that seemed disgusting (farts, erections, etc.) beautiful things. The cinematography is magnificent, with dark, blue, and beautiful scenery. Also, the soundtrack of the film is impressive, not using any instruments, and having the actors of the film sing it. This film could easily be classified as a musical. Although, this doesn't mean that there wasn't anything wrong with the film. There were some issues with it, when it kind of ""ran out of funny things"" it continued to turn into something else, like a buddy drama. There's a lot more things to be said about this film, but I stuck with the basics. This movie earns a 7/10 for me."

I have seen many films that reuse the same lines and usually the same plot, sometimes to the point where only minor visuals could tell apart the movies. This movie is one of the crafts that actually is new and introduces a special part of imagination that provokes interest, emotion, and revisiting of some of life ideals that other films either can't get or could dimly clinch. The movie itself starts off a bit dull, and almost lost me. I know it is just like music, some great parts are introduced after you hear few starting notes. Patience does pay off in these instances. Overall, the movie throws some thoughts and ideas that people hold inside, but the movie did not shy away from discussions and creation. I very much liked it."

Even the craziest of them have the sense not to drink water from the mouth of a week-dead corpse So all of the ""funny"" fart jokes and sophomoric musings on the meaning of life and so on – that was all nonsense because the lead character having these conversations with himself is totally insane and dangerous. Ha ha, joke is on you viewer. No real insights. Nothing to see here! When you teach 10-year-olds creative writing, you have to explain that the worst possible ending is ""it was all a dream."" I can only assume the director-writers are therefore not yet 10 years old.

The directors said that this is nothing like you've ever seen and I can sure agree with that. It was filled with real humor that isn't anything like the cookie cutter comedies you see today. But along with it, very deep messages on how people may see different behaviors and opinions as odd or inappropriate. My thoughts were provoked and my face in an almost constant smile throughout. I walked away from the movie feeling better and knowing my time was not wasted.I highly recommend this film to everyone I talk to about cinema. I'm sure it's difficult to make original films these days because there's nothing new under the sun, but this gets pretty close. There are nods to Cast Away for sure but it takes a whole different spin being stranded and a typical buddy-comedy.Thank you to both Daniels for a great time watching your art."

Wow was I wrong. My second thought about a half hour in was that maybe he was on some Pacific island where he would come across some WWII ruins to add to the story and that he was perhaps just loosing his marbles to a corpse friend. Then about an hour in I started to wonder how a man lost on a deserted isle (as the description states) could have enough strength to hump around a bloated decomposing body that probably weighed over 200 lbs. Not to mention how he could drink the bile that came out of his mouth and not vomit at the very smell. How is it that he wasn't waking up to a body covered in crabs every morning? Or seagulls? Then it finally came about 20 minutes from the end. He's a homeless mentally ill stalker who's been camping out behind his victims house stealing their trash and making crafts with it. What could have been the making of a great suspense thriller was wasted on fart and boner gags and just flat out duping the audience to watch it for the first hour and a half by lying to them and not in an ironic good plot structure way but just by confusing us to death. In my opinion the best part about the movie was the woman's reaction at the very end. ""Wtf?"""
" somehow, they managed to make this movie really work!
",0.0,0.9948,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"I am absolutely blown away.Not only is this bizarre indie film about a farting corpse and a lonely, suicidal man stranded on an island one of the funniest films of last year, but it is also one of the most emotionally moving. A movie about a farting corpse is moving? I guess so.The fact that the directors managed to make this film work splendidly despite it having such an off the walls plot is highly impressive, but the fact that they also managed to make it a beautiful and thought provoking piece of art is an even greatest achievement. Sure, there's jokes about farts and boners and masturbating throughout, but there's also meaningful commentary on life and love-and it is all complicated by a fantastic soundtrack (made up almost entirely of human voices) and excellent performances by Paul Dano and especially Daniel Radcliffe, who turns his role a weird corpse into one of the most memorable, hilarious, and likable movie characters I've seen in a long time. After having experienced this film, I'm almost at a loss for words. It's really just a movie I'd recommend any readers to watch on their own, because there's no point in me just describing the film's memorable events and dialogue-one should really just see it for themselves. It's a brilliant film that deserves much more praise than it has gotten. I was not expecting any Best Picture nominees to be given to such a weird movie, but I cannot get over the fact that the Oscars just flat out ignored the movie in terms of original score, screenplay, and performances.Seriously, this is a brilliant, underrated, surreal, laugh out loud funny, and emotionally overwhelming masterpiece that must be seen by those who can embrace the weirdness."
" A building expectations feel, that was left unfilled
",0.0,0.9148,2017-01-27 00:00:00,3,"I had some big expectations for this movie, as i heard a lot about it. As it started i thought ""ok, that's not what i was expecting"" ""maybie it gets better"" well, it didn't, the jokes are very very bad and the better part of this movie has nothing to do with comedy part of it, cause its quite bad, but instead about the message it brings and the finishing of the story that for me was somehow unexpected. Either way, i rated this 3 stars, wouldn't see it again. Very poor in terms of comedy, the whole movies feels like it has very little to offer and it leaves empty, waiting for more but it never gives you anything. I should make a remark for the great performance of the leading performance, as Paul Dano really did a great job performing this character."
" Original and Supremely Bizarre
",0.5719,0.9769,2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I need to start by saying this wasn't at all a bad movie, in fact it was pretty entertaining. The acting was great, and the cinematography was really nice. I noticed a by the end of the first act the use of extra-wide shots, not centred on the characters, reinforced the idea of them being lost and alone. Where this film lost me was the overuse of immature humour, it attempted at times to make the viewer feel a deep emotion, but was overshadowed by raw talk about sex and continuous farting.I liked the way the film did talk about being weird and cultural acceptance for that. This indie flick is most certainly not for everybody, but those who can see passed the immature humour and overall strangeness of the film, can come to appreciate it."
" 'Swiss Army Man' Has Everything you want.
",0.0772,0.9898,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"There are only a few times a year where a movie completely catches you off guard and there are fewer times where a movie will be imprinted and branded into your mind forever. 'Swiss Army Man' is one of those films. It's funny, disgusting, beautiful, and simply amazing on just about every level. This is where cinema is at its best. Director and writer pair Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as the Daniels) have masterfully crafted a screenplay and beautifully shot film that that covers just about every aspect of being alive and human. It's almost a coming-of-age story in a weird sort of way and is full of pure, amazing life, even though there is a corpse throughout the entire film. This movie takes those small, precious, awkward moments in life and puts them flat on the table for everyone to see. It's a little bit gross and weird, but it's also amazing and beautiful. I don't think any two people could have played the two parts any better than Paul Dano or Daniel Radcliffe did. They are simply phenomenal in their roles and bring such a heartfelt performance to each of their characters, that you can't help but want to spend more time with them.We first meet Hank (Dano) who is on a small deserted island, as he is about to hang himself with makeshift rope, when he suddenly sees a dead body on the shore (Radcliffe). After he slips and almost hangs himself to death, he walks over to the corpse only to find out that the corpse has a ton of gas still inside of it. Soon enough, Dano is riding this farting corpse like a jet ski to a bigger place where civilization might be. Hank brings the corpse with him as he tries to find help and home and figures out that this dead body has a lot of cool powers and uses, like chopping down trees, spewing up rain water, farting fire, and shooting things at super speed out of its mouth.The body soon begins to talk as Hank props this corpses head up and pokes and prods him to get him to do things. The corpse goes by Manny and is just as innocent as a newborn. Manny is discovering life and has no idea what it's like, so Hank answers all questions from jerking off, to riding a bus, to going on a date and listening to music, to watching movies and having parents, and even re-writing the childhood classic ""Everybody Poops"" with actual poop inside the pages of the bible. No matter what you may feel about this movie, there will be something good you will take away with it, whether it be friendship, love, accepting yourself and others, happiness, or just a farting corpse that smiles. It's all here and on display in the most beautiful fashion.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are incredible in these characters. Dano plays Hank with such charisma and charm, yet with a chaotic and scary side, that you are never too sure about him. You can love him one minute and be frightened of him the next. Hank has many layers to him and Dano executes each emotional layer flawlessly. Then there is Daniel Radcliffe, who might just deserve a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars this year for his role as a corpse. Even though Manny is supposed to be dead and gross, Radcliffe plays him with so much life, that he is, well – alive. I've never quite seen anything like it before.The two Daniels have really broken the mold with 'Swiss Army Man' and I'm sure this film will be etched into the minds of cinema lovers for years to come. The soundtrack is also fantastic by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell and has a fantastical and indie element about it. This is one of the most original and fun movies of the year."
" Easily One of the Strangest and Funniest Movies Ever Made
",0.7184,0.9845,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Paul Dano has done it again. He picks the most offbeat roles and plays them to perfection. This is particularly offbeat. And Daniel Radcliffe is outstanding as a guy who may be dead or may be very inadvertently resourceful with his body. Now there's a sentence you'd never thought you'd read. This movie has everything: action, comedy, drama, romance, suspense, and for good measure a hearty dose of flatulence. But don't let the last part put you off. This movie has a lot of heart. It's a clever idea. And the filmmakers should be commended for definitely thinking outside the box. It does start like a cross between Cast Away and Weekend at Bernies, but it grows into something so much better than either. This is my enthusiastic recommendation. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but mostly because you laughed so hard you cried."
" Pleasantly Surprised
",0.6124,-0.5541,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"When this film came out in theaters I heard mixed reviews saying that it's either for you or isn't. That being said after finally watching the film I can't believe how great it was. This is not a perfect 10/10 film but its crazy good. Daniel Radcliffe's character is stupid af and yet I fell in love with him. Paul Dano was also great but Daniel blew me away (with his farts). This film is about Paul who is stuck on an island about to kill himself discovers a body (Radcliffe) and slowly brings him back to life. Pauls character was dead on the inside and by showing Daniel how great life can be he himself begins to come back to life. The story takes place on an island and in a forest/jungle and they make their way back to civilization. What these two characters go through together enriches their friendship and surprisingly it moves us even with some ridiculous premises. The music in the film is amazing and the performances are fantastic. I may be praising the film only because it shouldn't have worked and not only did it work but it exceeded that. Overall, I give Swiss Army Man an 8.5/10. This is a survival comedy at heart with some twists and turns."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9922,2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie after I saw it went straight to my top 5 movies ever, maybe the top one, I don't know, certainly it's in my forever top 5! Daniels created an original movie, never seen before anything like that. A really smart and beautiful script, from which, in my opinion, every line is a quote. The script deals basic with friendship and true love, wherever it comes from. It includes comedy, drama, musical, action, and sci-fi, all of them used harmoniously and came to impressive results. The directing was spectacular. The image was eye-catching, with wild and beautiful scenery.The actors played a very serious part to this result. They gave life to the script in a higher than any expectation way. Personally I think Daniel Radcliffe is one of the best actors of his generation. He did a really tough work in this movie. Playing all the time an almost dead man, I was impressed. This guy is a true actor. In every movie there is nothing that reminds my of him in any other role. He is really transforming himself. This was the first movie I ever saw Paul Dano and I think I need to see and other stuff he has done, because his was really good, different from the classic style of American actors, with beautiful and true gaze. Oh last but not least, the music. There is a music pattern used repeatedly in the movie but it is changing in the way.I loved the fact that the most of the parts are sang by Paul and Daniel. It was not only a detail but a contributing factor to the end result.I really loved the result. Great and never seen before!!! Congratulations to the hole team! You must watch this movie, you really have to!"
" One Of The Best Films Of The Year!!!!
",0.7482,0.9895,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"The most original film of the year and one of the more original films of the last decade. Swiss Army Man turned a lot of people away with the weird juvenile humour consisting of farts, but I feel like those people who turned it off or left the theatre missed out on something special. Behind all the gas, the film deals with depression, humanity and what it feels like to be alive. Poignant themes in a film that isn't a afraid to make you laugh in the weirdest way possible. Hank, played by Paul Dano, is marooned on an island and is literally about to hang himself when he sees a dead body wash ashore. He thinks nothing of it, until the body spasms and lets out numerous farts. The dead body, whom is later called Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe, comes alive, more or less. He's able to have conversations, perform miraculous tasks and gives Hank the courage to look inside himself and answer some deep questions. This is my favourite Daniel Radcliffe performance, is that odd to say? He plays a corpse who farts, so he doesn't have to move around a lot and he is basically stone faced the whole film, yet he brings an innocent charm to the role. He questions what it means to be alive, what feeling of love hate and depression are. Hank tries his best to answer these questions, but he might not even know the answers himself. The two bond over a few ""Weekend At Bernie's"" style comedy bits, which have more meaning later on when more characters are introduced, specifically Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The title Swiss Army Man is appropriate as Radcliffe is used for various tasks. Fresh water pours out of his mouth, karate-chop action figure style arm swing, projectile mouth firing mechanism, sparking flint by snapping his fingers, among other things. Hank uses Manny's unique ""powers"" to help him traverse the terrain. You have to ask yourself, can you suspend enough of your imagination to enjoy the oddity of this? I don't think the film is ever really concerned with if any of these events are really happening or not. Instead it wants you to focus on the friendship these two have and despite one of them being dead, it's one of the best relationships depicted on screen this year. I know there are people out there who dislike the film, but count me in the camp of people who really responded to it. Who knew that film about a farting dead corpse would be one of the best of the year and one of the most honesty portrays of friendship. Swiss Army Man is a win and a watch for anyone wanting something unique in their movie going experience."
" Just because the movie is not mainstream, it doesn't mean its instantly good or with deep meaning. Enough of that bullshit.

Actually I have to say this is not even pretentious, is just a movie with nothing to offer, except in the minds of those Pseudo-intellectual people who try very very hard to find deep meaning and goes to a huge meaningless analysis of this kind of surrealistic movies, because they think they are outside of the system. Don't get me wrong, I like surrealistic movies like synecdoche New York for example. But this is just bad. Im surprised that got a budget to make it.Not dramatic enough, not funny enough, not surreal enough. Like I said, nothing to offer. Skip this one"
" Truly inspiring
",0.6908,0.6073,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Half way through the film I realised why it was named Swiss Army Man, like the knife, multipurpose. Speaking of purpose who would have thought a semi-dead man could give a sense of that (purpose) to someone on the verge of committing suicide. Every few scenes you'll think that it's just silly movie but soon enough it snaps back to a more serious theme. The message from what I gather is that you can find love and life in the most unlikely of places. In short you take the movie Castaway and replace Tom Hanks with Paul Dano (Who is apparently named Hank in the film) the Wilson the volleyball with this guy clinging on to life(Daniel Radcliffe )aka Manny, set the two on a crazy adventure ride back to humanity and you get Swiss Army Man."

I'm not saying that the idea of a man finding a corpse on the beach couldn't be the beginning of an interesting film, I'm saying this film isn't it. Save your time and money, and watch anything else. There is a YouTube clip of an Iguana farting in the bathtub. Watch that one instead!I'd like to add, Paul Dano is a great actor, and Daniel Radcliffe is alright. Why they both ended up in this project I'm not sure off... But for whatever reason they did this to their careers. Luckily one of them has enough money not to have to work again."

Right after the movie was done, I said to myself : well, that was quite an adventure! Few days later, I was still making running gag with my boyfriend about it.

Literally, from the first scene to the last one.Not only happy with the constant fart, there are some very low erection/masturbation jokes that last way too long.

The body is Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) a name given to him by Hank. Hank tries to revive Manny but all he accomplishes is listening to Manny giving off tremendous amounts of gas. The rest of the movie is Hank protecting Manny and getting him to talk.When I saw the promos I saw where this may be a funny comedy. And , yes, thoughts of WEEKEND WITH BERNIE did enter my head, but this was not a comedy (well except for the gas coming from Manny) and I didn't see or hear anything funny the rest of the way. Hank discovers that Manny has supernatural powers.somewhatsort of.but don't get hung up on that as the most interesting aspect of that was the expulsion of gas that allows Manny to propel himself through the water. I lost all interest when Hank and Manny talk about masturbation and erection jokes that were not funny, and that went on for way too long. At that moment , I scanned the movie the rest of the way and probably lost any significant meaning to all this, and am doubtful there was any. Was this clever or just plain stupid? Since I didn't see any semblance of a comedy, I will go with stupid. However, all that said above I did find the acting by both Dano and Radcliffe to be pretty good, but since this was not a comedy that it should have been STUPID wins. (2/10)Violence: Not really.

" Swiss Army Man
",0.0,0.9825,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"""Swiss Army Man"" is a movie that has gotten a lot of attention this year for using probably one of the strangest concepts since ""Being John Malkovich"". The film is about Hank, a man stranded on an island, who sees a corpse wash up onto the shore just as he was about to commit suicide. The opening credits consist of Hank riding the corpse across the ocean, powered by the corpse's flatulence. This corpse gives Hank hope. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, it is clear that this movie is going to be insane, but against all odds, it does grow on you. But by the last 10 minutes you won't know what is even real anymore. As the film began, I thought I understood what was going on. Yes, there is a farting corpse, but this corpse seemed to be a reflection of Hank, with all his insecurities and fears and secret desires, and it seemed as if the film would be Hank's journey to get over his fears. Hank's mom died when he was at a young age, and he never really had much of a strong connection with his dad, he was mostly made fun of in school, and never really had anyone to care about or love. He is basically completely alone and disconnected. Then the corpse begins to speak, and according to him, his name is Manny. It begins to become apparent that Hank and him share many memories, once again seeming to hint to the fact that Manny is a figment of his imagination. Again, from the start it is clear that all the music that we hear is coming from Hank thinking of the melody or tune, so it seems that we are witnessing the world from Hank's point of view, again showing that Manny may also be a part of his mind. The dynamic between the two characters is hilarious, and the tug and pull between Manny's unfiltered dialogue and Hank's oppressive attitude suggests his struggle of what he wants and what other people will think. After the end, I'm not so sure about what I think was really happening. What I can say is that the film is very original and surprisingly clever. It uses the low brow sense of humor to great effect, with a lot of physical comedy and witty gags coming from this concept of a magical corpse, while also having strangely heartfelt moments while still managing to be self aware. It is directed with style and energy, making the film consistently engaging and funny when this concept could've been very one note. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are both great, and they should be, since they are the only 2 actors for the majority of the film, and one of them is a corpse.What I've come to think about the ending is that it's not about what is really happening or what's in Hank's head, but it's about the transition that Hank goes through at the end. He defies his self imposed rules, and he reveals himself for who he is, without holding back anything. He gets the reactions of surprise, confusion, and disgust, but he also gets understanding, which is shown through his father. And the point is that he really doesn't care what other people think, he's satisfied knowing that he doesn't have to hide himself anymore.I do think that the ending confuses things a little bit, but I like that it remained surprising and unpredictable to the very end. It seems like the filmmakers began writing the film with the intent of showing Manny as a part of Hank's mind, but I do understand why they would choose this more confusing ending that seems to contradict the assumption that Manny is a figment of Hank's imagination. At first I thought they were just trying to make it as weird as possible, but I think since the whole film is from Manny's perspective, these last moments are simply a way of showing that he has gotten over his self imposed loneliness. I didn't love the ending as much as the rest of the film, but it certainly didn't ruin the film for me. There were many ways this could've ended, and this at least seemed to make sense as far as the themes the film was going for.If ""Swiss Army Man"" is one thing, it's original. It's genuinely well-directed and well-acted, and there really isn't any other movie quite like this. Despite it being a quirky and funny comedy that involved a magical corpse and lots of gas, there was sincerity in this movie. You begin to connect with these two characters. It taps into universal fears such as loneliness and death, as strange as that sounds. Oh, and it has one of the best soundtracks of the year."

There are lot of ""what the hell is this"" scenes but you'll be laughing while saying it. So deep with ease. Gross but different. It's a dark movie with feel good essence in it.Technologically not so rich but that doesn't count since the movie is deep in it's story line. Makers are successful in expressing the concept. It's a unique watch. This movie makes so much sense and no sense at same time. It's not a best on its philosophical terms but it's definitely a worth watch. Different attempt under comedy genre. Being added to the category Fantasy makes sense. I recommend watching this. Definitely a good movie."
