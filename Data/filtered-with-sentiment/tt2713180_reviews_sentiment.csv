",0.0,0.8793,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Wow, its a great film but an even cooler milestone. Brilliant acting and some fairly realistic scenes."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.9022,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"It is a war, where there is no place and no meaning for feelings. It is a war where a soldier sacrifices himself for the sake of the homeland as he is told, while he fights for the sake of the masters.Very nice movie."
" Furious first half, lacklustre latter
",-0.5719,-0.9452,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Tank combat is the name of the game here, and this movie does personify fury.The fights are fast, violent, and clearly casualty-heavy. Watching shells ricochet off tank armour and whistle into the mist is a polished cinematic touch too.It's a shame that the semi-authentic situations used in ""Fury"" end halfway through the film, giving way to some patriotic rubbish with no believability, and more crucially, little to no tank action. Suddenly soldiers that hated one another are best friends, all willing to die in a war they don't even care about.Brad Pitt misses the mark for me: yes, he cuts the shape of a damaged war veteran, but comes across as someone with a really warped sense of judgement and leadership. On top of this, he waxes lyrical with cryptic messages, which doesn't really befit his grizzled tank commander persona. Wise beyond his years? More ""a***hole without cause"".The tank crew have similar issues, flip-flopping between being remorseless hardheads and compassionate comrades. LaBeouf is competent as a blindly religious gunner, but I don't love Peña, and Bernthal does less than nothing for me. Logan Lerman himself must be getting really bored of playing spineless characters by now, such is typecasting.The music is deployed horribly. Scenes that would be vastly improved by relying only on dialogue and gun chatter have dramatic instrumentals cramping the scene, diffusing any tension or drama.""Fury"" starts out brooding and gutsy, quickly declines, and goes out with barely a whimper."
" Didn't watch it for its accuracy I watched it for its action.
",0.0,-0.9338,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"This is a great war movie, if you are into that sort of thing. If you are watching it because you are a history buff you are going to get annoyed by it as there are loads of inaccuracies.The pacing is brutally fast, I am not 100% sure this isn't happening all in one day or if it is supposed to be spread out and you just can't quite tell.There are some pretty graphic scenes of people getting killed and the dark depressing environment can really get to you. I find myself having to watch lighter stuff after watching a movie like this. It's like a horror movie only based on real events.If you want to see a war movie with lots of people getting killed and explosions and shooting then this is a good one, on par with Saving Private Ryan. So I would totally recommend it."
" Not a Brad Pit fan....
",0.0,0.7217,2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Not a Brad Pit fan, until now. He nailed this roll with apparent ease, though I suspect it speaks well for his diversity. Remaining cast fits similar to hand in glove. Believably written and played. I must now go back and review another of his films to reconsider."
" Fury (about the historically incorrect tactics)
",-0.5719,-0.6199,2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"The movie works as a dramatic war movie, and does its best to show you how soldiers were affected by their deeds, and what they saw and experienced.There are some scenes that does not make sense though. A tiger tank charging towards more nimble opponents? Why? It could have taken them out from kilometres away... And it would have turned on its belts to keep it's ""ass"" out of the line of fire.But the last scenes with the tank in the crossroads bugs the hell out of me. Did the people writing this never research german anti-tank tactics? They would have used satchel charges, magnetic mines, or bundled grenades to deal with the immobilized tank. And who runs up to a tank in the open when there are bushes and ditches to take cover from its view?Still an exciting movie from an action perspective, with some good performances from the cast. I just don't think it is a realistic depiction of ww2 tactics."
" Unrealistic. Paints that the Germans can't shoot...
",0.0,-0.9715,2021-03-10 00:00:00,4,"Not overall bad. But seriously... the allies where not superheroes.
In the movie the odds are even in numbers, but the truth is that the allies had tons of equipment, tanks and air superiority. The Germans where poorly mechanised (through the war only about 20% where mechanized) where almost out of fuel in this time of war and had shortage of soldiers.For example the battle about 30min into the movie where 4 Sherman tanks are attacking, the Germans are missing EVERY anti tank shot... from short distance... sure. And also they are firing one at the time... c'mon... then almost all German soldiers get shot and no allies.... :xThe Germans where not superheroes but knew how to fight. They had few tanks but knocked out tons of allies tanks.
Even if I'm on the allies side, there are better movies than this."
" Cliché fest
",0.0,-0.1027,2021-03-08 00:00:00,3,"Brad Pitt hamming it as a soldier half his age, had to put subtitles on to get past the exaggerated accents. If you're expecting Saving private Ryan, watch Saving private Ryan"
" This movie is missing something
",-0.296,0.8641,2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The acting and the action in this movie are great, but I feel like the story could have been better."
" The final scene ruins what could have been a great (though historically unaccurate) movie
",0.296,-0.9463,2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,"I trully enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film.
First because it's about a part of the war that is not presented that often, and second because of the way it's presented. The actors are good, Pitt is excellent, and it's globally very satisfying to watch. Of course the opposition between the naive new soldier and those have seen more and are twisted by the war, followed by the way they begin to understand each other and bond is quite cliché but it was handled well.
Yes they took some historical/technical liberties, but I could get over those I spotted because they sort of made sense in the narrative.And then came the final scene...
It was so bad it pulled me out of the movie and even ruined the first part for me. I was okay with the cliché patriotic final where they sacrifice their lives for the greater good. But not like that.
This fight was excruciatingly long and unrealistic, and l don't see what was the point of making that SS batallion look like a bunch of amateurs strugling against one broken tank with Fury magically avoiding bullets for like 10 minutes in a scene worthy of The Expendables."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.6696,2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,One of the best produced ww2 movies ever! Action from beginning to end
" The 2nd best war movie I've ever seen (big war movie buff here)
",-0.5574,0.5468,2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"Number 1 is Hacksaw Ridge, I tell you what though - Fury ALMOST took the number one spot, it is that good. The quality is incredible, the music is unbelievably moving - the soundtrack is absoloutely the best of any war movie I've seen. And these actors just NAILED IT. Shia LaBeouf especially - he plays a devout Christian. While playing the role he actually had an incredible encounter with God and it SHOWS. Especially in the tank just before their finale battle. You'll fall apart - but in a good way. Okay I'll stop rattling on now, Bloody well watch it!"
" Too harsh
",-0.4404,-0.9313,2021-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Frighteningly effective battle scenes interspersed with some nice moments and emotionally harsh violence. Lerman and von Rittburg stand out. But too much of the harsh, gratuitous violence for me."
" Wow, tough crowd!
",0.5562,0.954,2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Despite all the negative reviews on this site that point out how unrealistic this film is, I would like to point out that it is extremely entertaining.I grew up with classic WWII films like The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc. and if you just want to be entertained by a very good cast and a movie about a tank crew towards the end of the war, look no further.Very few movies about WWII were completely factual and to take this movie to task for choosing entertainment over reality misses the point of the film, in my opinion. There are many excellent documentaries available to watch and study but this film was never meant to be one. If you want to see a very entertaining WWII film about a tank crew, I believe most viewers will find this a good use of their time."
" Loved it.
",0.5994,0.7906,2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"This puts you in the drivers seat of a tank in WW 2. A great action movie, although the ending could have been better."
" Seems like Brad wanted to have his own Private Ryan
",0.3612,0.9182,2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie is gory. Camera zooms onto blood and guts from the beginning - part of face in the tank (what for?) until the end when Gemans are actually minced..... and GCI is so effective.... Like a manual - Look this is what 50 cal bullets do....The main hero is typical for Brad characters when it comes to dramas - tired..... yet damn effective.... mission oriented.... team leader and so on...When I watch this movie I feel like Brad is saying or screaming LOOK I WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER than TOM HANKS!!!That is what this movie is about - for me.Some kind of inside movie industry demonstration - that we can also make suhc film and that Brad is better....Besides actually I have no idea why these people got killed ....I really Enjoyed Eastwood and Sutherland in their great flick.....
Sometimes I feel like GCI guys need to show off....."
" Stupidest war movie ever
",-0.8074,-0.6908,2021-01-18 00:00:00,1,My god what a stupid movie. Pure Hollywood. They must think movie goers are really stupid.
" A decent enough film.
",0.0,-0.6575,2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent enough WWII film, the main issue with it is none of the characters are likable.
I literally didn't care that they were slaughtered, they were all obnoxious. There was no real character arc with any of them. The film gave no reason to like them or to feel anything for them other than contempt.
The action was decent enough, though ultimately you knew what the outcome was going to be during each encounter. It just lacked imagination i felt. The 'love interest' was meant to be the moment Norman turned into a killer, but it lacked any real substance and any real reason.
Overall, it wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't great. It wasn't a 'Saving Private Ryan' or even a 'Kelly's Heroes'... It was just, well... It was just."
" POINTLESS VIOLENT MOVIE
",-0.5994,0.9473,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time! There is nothing about this movie interesting. It is nothing but violence and depicts WWII GIs as animals. It is pointless and a waste of time. If you want the true story of WWII and the men who fought it then watch ""Band Of Brothers"" an outstanding account featuring the real stories of Easy Company from D-Day until the end of the war. It has short clips from interviews before each episode of the actial men ootrayed in the story."
" Ideals are peaceful, History is violent
",0.0258,0.8126,2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,"One of the best war films in the last decade that follows a tank crew in Nazi Germany in the later stages of the European front. All the members of the crew were brilliant led by a man called Wardaddy Collier (Brad Pitt) followed by Bible (Shia LeBeouf), Norman (Logan Lerman), Gordo (Michael Pena) and Travis (Jon Bernthal). The writing was strong and packs a massive punch"
" Compelling & terrific

Changes from the usual war movies exposing a different point of view."
" Solid but not very realistic
",0.0772,-0.308,2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,"Brad Pitt stars in this WWII drama about a tank and its crew. It is very well directed and acted and all the production is very good. How David Ayer went from this to Suicide Squad is baffling as I thought this was his best directed movie and showed real growth and maturity. All of that came crumbling down with the horrendous work he did in Suicide Squad, it's like they were directed by two different people. As I said before all the actors do a really good job with, what is for me the highlight of the movie, its characters. On the other hand the realism of the battle sequences is horrendous, culminating in a final act that is almost laughable from a war movie point of view, transforming what is a hard as nails believable war movie into a propagandistic American blockbuster. So, how to rate this movie becomes a very hard task, as I loved the characters and overall feel and direction but hated the last act. I still think the good outweighs the bad and give it a strong recommendation."
" TANKS IN ACTION
",0.0,0.3431,2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,A good representation of cruelty in war; it is exciting and very epic. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
" A powerful film
",0.4215,-0.8883,2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"In my experience there are two types of war films. Those that blindly cover our protagonists in glory and display hubristic levels patriotism and self righteousness. Then there are those that lay bare the horrors of war in an uncompromising way, casting a grey shadow over the morality of war and the actions of those involved.Fury falls into the latter category, presenting a much more emotional, powerful, nuanced, and nihilistic view of war. I liked that the film took this route, as it made for some very engaging and gripping cinema, with a decent layer of emotion beneath the action.This was mostly captured through Logan Lerman's character, who experienced a stark transformation throughout the film. He portrayed the character superbly, and I could really relate to his emotion and feeling. The rest of the cast were all fantastic, particularly John Berthnal and Shia LaBeouf. This isn't one of those war films where violence is glorified and the effects of war on the soldiers is ignored. This is explored in a good level of depth and the cast rose to this challenge perfectly.The action was really engrossing, and also uncomfortable to watch at times, which should be the case in a war film. The tank combat was very tense and quite unique, I haven't really seen anything like it in any other war films I've seen. They managed to capture the cramped atmosphere inside the tank brilliantly.Fury is definitely a must for any lovers of WW2 films and war/action films in general. It has solid action, as well as great characterisation, performances, and direction."
" Fury Review

" This movie could have been good, but it sucked instead.
",-0.4678,0.5865,2020-12-19 00:00:00,3,"How many bites does it take for Brad Pitt to finish an egg anyway? It was one egg and he was eating a lot.The battle scenes are good. The end? Terrible. I still don't understand why. Forget how the unbelievable battle unfolded. WHY did it happen? Answer me that. I would have absolutely said ""ok guys, I'm out of here, because I don't understand why we would stay, and the only reason I'm being given is ""we have to hold the crossroads."" Why was the extra ammo kept outside of the tank? Just complete Hollywood going nuts the last 45 minutes. It's insane. That's why I'm giving three instead of one. I respect them really going for it lol."
" This movie is more accurate than you believe. Highly Recommended
",0.2716,0.9672,2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"As a three time veteran and a Military Historian, is extremely accurate in the doctrine of tank warfare of World War II. The nickname the Germans gave the M4 Sherman was the English translation of ""zippo"" which could be seen very easily in this movie. The movie was correct on the orange ring that would appear in defeated armor as the round passed through, something no other movie as ever presented. This include the type of rounds that they tank would fire...incendiary, ball, smoke, and wooly pete. The final scene was not for the fight scene, it was a final testament to the determination of the Waffen SS, so for those who think is it silly, yes, it had to be silly to prove their ferocity. The youth fighting with panzerfausts was very accurate and the devastation that the weapons brought may have been a little exaggerated, but not by much. M4s were scattered throughout the European Theatre and having 4 in the same place happened, but not often. YES...TIGERS (Tiger 1) or PANZER VI ARE THAT DEVESTATING. If you watch this movie and are expecting Band Of Brothers type good, well, BOB is only as good as the information that was given to them by the survivors by way of Ambrose. This movie is fictional, but vast research was done on it and since it was released in 2014, not many survivors were left. So take it easy on this flick...watch it again, turn up the THX to eviction levels, and marvel in the sound, visual effects, a solid performance from BP, and the soundtrack isn't half bad. There is a reason that not many tank movies have been made. The average watcher becomes board with the little space within the tank. Most of it happens outside of the tank, and unfortunately, that has to be embellished. Not saying anyone that grades this movie different is wrong, just offering a different perspective. So traverse left, think what you would do for a chocolate bar, and don't let anyone touch your moustache. :) Cheers"
" Basically boring until it ain't.
",-0.3182,0.4588,2020-12-16 00:00:00,6,It gets good... Trust me. Shia LaBeouf is definitely 'different'. Definitely highlights and shows (like this is one gory movie) the horrors or war. Good movie. Bear through the first 55 minutes.
" A below average war movie
",-0.5994,-0.5994,2020-12-10 00:00:00,4,Difficult to care about the crew when you know nothing about them. It was just laughable when Pitt made the new guy kill an unarmed nazi infront of everyone. The ending battle scene made the germans look like idiots and not experienced soldiers. When the SS soldier saw the main character under the tank and didn't say anything I wanted to turn off the tv
" Entertaining but not educational.
",0.2382,0.8014,2020-12-03 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the movie. All I can say is to watch the movie for entertainment but please don't put much stock in its authenticity. The idea of GIs playing ""piano grenade roulette"" at any time but, much less, as such a late stage of the war is just plain stupid. That being said, the acting was superb and the plot was very entertaining."
" Such a waste of good talent
",0.4404,0.8934,2020-11-28 00:00:00,5,"Great cast, trite story line. This was a paint by the numbers film. It felt like a copycat ripoff of Saving Private Ryan. Battle hardened vets, check, whimpy out of place recruit, check, similar ending. Wow, what a waste. With some creativity they could have created a much better film with the cast they had available."
" Loved it
",0.5994,0.8374,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,I loved this movie so much. Whenever Brad Pitt is in a war movie you know it's going to be good. The casting was amazing and it was such a good movie. The ending was such a big plot twist and i wasn't prepared for it.

" Who were the bad guys again?
",-0.5423,-0.9862,2020-11-15 00:00:00,2,"Horrible movie. Just an ode to violence and it doesn't seem realistic to me.
Brad Pitt is not hat he's best.
Not sure if the movie tries to criticise the actions of wwII USA soldiers who went too far or if it is just glorifying killing indiscriminatelly and justying every single violation of the Geneva Convention that those soldiers to.
Too much is too much and watching another movie that pretends to show heroes fighting bad guys but were the so called good guys in fact do more harm than the bad ones and it is all justified because ""we are Americans, they are not"" is too much for me. That scene where Brad Pitt tells the new guy to kill a surrendering POW is just outrageous and unjustifiable. We can not glorify acts of murder like that, special in a film that pretends to be ""realistic""."

" Call of duty WW2 THE MOVIE😂
",0.0,0.0387,2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"This is enjoyable if you pretend it's the call of duty video game. It's not realistic and it think it's audience is stupid. But it's fun watching tank wars, the battles are quite fun to watch. Too many clichés and the exchange between the German women is way too long, takes up half the movie.Watch it once and never again."
" Far-fetched but fierce, brutal WWII action film
",-0.7684,-0.9922,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"In the dying days of the War in Europe, the disparate crew of a damaged American tank stranded in a critical crossroads take a stand against an entire battalion of German infantry. The film is extremely well made, especially the battle scenes, which are grim and gripping (although a number of criticisms have been made about the realism of the encounter with the Tiger tank). Fury's crew include some of the standard war-film character tropes (the new guy, the religious guy, the super-competent tough guy (a Sargent, as usual), the unhinged guy), but they are all well portrayed by the ensemble cast (although Jon Bernthal overdoes it a bit as the abrasive reprobate Travis). The final showdown goes on a bit long and the German Waffen SS troops (a group particularly hated by the Fury's crew) seem a bit incompetent as they repeatedly run into, or through, the tank's machine gun killing-fields (as evidenced by the halo of dead soldiers seen in the final shots). Considering that (when 'buttoned up) the tank only has the bow and co-axial machine guns to defend itself against infantry, at any given moment, one side or the rear would be exposed and, as the Germans have anti-tank weapons, the extended survival of Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) and his crew seems a bit miraculous. Still, despite some implausibilities, inadequate character development (apparently a lot of Collier's backstory was cut out), and a couple of predictable 'war is hell' scenarios, 'Fury' remains a grim, exciting, bloody, and entertaining 'men under fire' war-film (but note: having never outgrown my little-boy fascination with tanks (especially WWII German), I'm going to rate highly any movie that fields real armour)."
" Excellent war movie - Pitt at his best
",0.6124,-0.0821,2020-11-02 00:00:00,9,"One of the best WWII movies I've seen in... well, a long time. Engaging characters, superb action sequences and the evils of war on gut-wrenching display. I don't understand some of the negative ratings for this movie. Yes, there may be inaccuracies, but it's still a great story of terrible times and conditions that, mercifully, few have experienced. Gripping until the end. No one is the cliched good guy or villain - not those American boys, not those reviled Germans .and certainly not Pitt's hard-bitten commander. The movie, unlike some of its predecessors, beats no drum for the wholesomeness of the American soldier or the American way. ""Fury""'s message is that no one escapes war without being tarnished, broken, morally compromised... but that amid its horrors, loyalty and even compassion can still survive."
" Pretty good overall
",0.7269,-0.9845,2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Yes this movie has some unrealistic elements to it as most movies do which deal with a subject pertaining to history but there was one thing about this movie which I found completely realistic and believable. This takes place in April 1945, just weeks before the German surrender. At this point in the war Germany knew they couldn't possibly win but wouldn't surrender and I thought this movie showed the frustration many Allied soldiers felt at having to continue risking their lives fighting an enemy who just won't surrender. Overall I thought the movie was well done and showed a more brutal side to war, it's not perfect but is definitely worth watching if you're not looking for a feel good film."
" Honest review
",0.5106,0.647,2020-10-15 00:00:00,5,"Points for the cinematography, ambiance, acting, but not much more really. I feel like they got a couple of things right but the plot was stupid, their actions were even more so.
For instance: In one scene we are shown how much respect the squad has for their sergeant, and in the next scene they are disrespecting him and behaving like complete baboons (and I don't even want to to get into the killing horses story - just why?) and the last act is the cherry on top. 
SPOILER ALERT: When they decide to just face around 300 german soldiers, like they have nothing to go back to once the war is over, like they don't have anything to lose. Might as well have killed themselves and ended the movie right then and there, saving us the last half hour of the movie. No bravery. No honor. No heroes. Nothing worth watching.I'm no going to comment further on this, it's just pointless. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone with a brain."

" Cliché isn't quite a harsh enough word
",0.3865,0.963,2020-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Every director has their trademark. Michael Bay with explosions, JJ Abrams with lens flares, Tarantino with feet, you get the idea. David Ayer seems to have his niche with employing great casts, a promising concept, and high production value, and squandering it on stale, formulaic direction.
This isn't actually a terrible war movie, I can do a pretty good job of suspending disbelief of the inaccuracies, but what it DOES do right, other war movies have done before, and done better. It was one cliche after another. Even the relatively obscure Saints and Soldiers (a war movie that actually incorporated faith in a seamless way, unlike this one) was more emotional and enticing than Fury, and that was made by a low budget Mormon company.
If you're like me and you're looking for a few hours to kill while you're getting caught up on your laundry, Fury is a good, decently entertaining way to occupy some time. Entirely forgettable, though."
" Fantastic
",0.5574,0.7906,2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,Set in an era less reviewed by WW2 related media this movie truly is a great.
" Almost really good
",0.4432,-0.5023,2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,"While watching Fuy I constantly felt like something was missing, I really wanted it to be deeper. The characters were there, but we don't really dive deep into them.The production value combined with the soundtrack was what made it captivating, but the resolution was just right out a summer blockbuster. In a film about war, I didn't quite expect a Michael Bay ending. And even though the movie really wanted to make me emotional about the last stand...it just didn't work.I'm not a war historian, but I also spotted some weird choices and the lack of realism. It still would've been fine, but the story itself just doesn't know what it's trying to be.Now, writing this short review while watching the credits, I am not emotionally moved or drained, and for a war film, a thoughtful message or a strong emotional root should be the thing that makes it stand out. And while the introductory act felt like it was trying to establish something, later scenes were either confusing or just straight-up nonsensical (including the dialogue).It actually made me sad that a film with such production value and actors was so mishandled to the point of becoming a simple action film with propaganda undertones."

No fury, but fluffy...Things that bug me in particular: the soundtrack sounds like music for a romantic dramatic movie, but this is a full on slaughter movie and such a fierce movie does not mix well with a sentimental soundtrack at all.More bad: the photography is too clean and good looking, when war movies need a gritty and bleak looking photography.Not any good? Well, it has got lots of gory action scenes with mutilated soldiers who get blown up in detail. For those who like that kind of stuff...

" Another cheesy war movie.
",-0.5994,-0.9889,2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"Fury is advertised as a gritty war story but nothing about it feels gritty to me. Every location just look and feels like a set. All the makeup also does not looks gritty, it looks dirty for sure, but it's not good, for god's sake the bullets look like they're from star wars, i'm not kidding they look very similar to star wars bullets. The use of CGI also really takes away the gritty feel that the film wants to have so badly.The dialogue is very poor and laughable at times, it's just the cheesiest screenplay you can imagine, it uses every trope and every cliché in the book.There are a couple of good scenes here and there, for example, the piano scene is pretty well presented and more thoughtful than the rest of the movie.The acting was bad, I think this is the fault of the director though. None of the actors look like they have any idea what to do, especially Logan Lerman and Michael Pena, first why cast Michael Pena in anything he's got to be one of the single worst living actors, and Lerman just had no idea what he was meant to do and was god awful.Fury does not have a lot to say, there is an obvious anti-war message, but that has been done I don't know how many times. Fury has no new approach to presenting this message and in the end it was just another chessy, soulless war movie."

Also showing that U.S troops were capable of atrocities, just like any other combatant (from other nations). The best part of the movie was seeing a real legendary Tiger Tank in Action. The one that is used in this movie (the only working one in the World), is Tiger 131 (housed at Bovington Tank Museum). Obviously in real warfare it would have smashed those American tanks to a zillion pieces. The ratio of Tiger to Sherman K.O's is 14 to 1. One Tiger knocked out 50 T-34's on the Eastern Front. The ending is the most fantastical war scene I ever seen. All of a sudden 'Fury' turns into Star Wars but way less believable. How do 100's of Waffen SS soldiers fail to beat a a severely crippled tank. It's highly unlikely that they would have been there at the end of the war (singing along a road). The SS committed beastly war crimes (true) but they were also crack combat troopers. My 10 year old boy stated the pure obvious.! ""Why the hell did they not fire the boxes of 'Panzerfausts' they had at hand!"" I'm sure everyone apart from the Director, was thinking the very same absurdity.

The movie accomplished the goal of showing that war is hell and cannot be refined, to paraphrase General Sherman. Even the American ""good guys"" can be as bloodthirsty and barbaric as the Nazis or the Russians. The final ""Battle of the Alamo"" is certainly heroic, but seems far from realistic, mainly because it is hard to believe the SS troops would just throw themselves at one tank en masse without pulling back and planning some better strategy. But who knows? If this was based on any true incident it's one I've never heard of. It certainly shows how short a tanker's life expectancy must have been when confronting the superior German tanks. Also, there probably were cases of clerk/typists being thrown into action. I suspect, however, that they were usually given a rifle and sent to the front lines rather than being tossed into a job requiring some previous mechanical training, such as tank gunner or bomber tail gunner."

Still, we get to see the ugliness of war from the perspective of tankers, which is one that hasn't been explored in a lot of depth in very many military films.

It is certainly not for the squeamish as our intrepid tank crew - led by Brad Pitt - fight their way across Germany towards the end of WWII. It's a sort of cross between the ""Dirty Dozen"" (1967) and ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009) but lacks the style and humour of both. Pitt is OK, is he ever anything more, as are Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman (who certainly looks the part as the rookie) and Michael Peña who make up the bulk of his war-weary crew on their mission, but the story has too many self-inflicted wounds; especially the scenes with the two women at breakfast.

I enjoyed this film, but it didn't have that element.*Spoilers Below*Norman, young, green, and terrified, shares a look of love with a beautiful young German girl who moved out out the way of the tanks with her bike. This kind scene- with their eyes meeting and communicating so much h- is typical of the love at first type moment. I mean she was just beautiful and he was clearly enamored. Not only is the moment interrupted by the crudest of jokes, but we not 15 mins later see that she's been hung by the Nazis. I was disappointed there wasn't going to be a future with her.Next, he falls fast for an equally beautiful girl at a house him and Wardaddy come across in a town they take. They are clearly taken with each other, and are distraught when they must part. Maybe he can get back to her after all the dying is over? The war is almost over anyway.... Sadly, no. Not ten minutes after their separation, we see her lying in a pile of rubble, dead.As others have pointed out, this movie tells a message. There are war heroes, but nothing is heroic or romantic about war itself. There is light in the darkness (of war), but the darkness will snuff it out shortly.There is nothing in this movie that is redeemed. Nothing salvaged. It just ends."

",-0.3182,0.9407,2020-06-16 00:00:00,4,"I can't believe I actually gave this film an ""8"". I remember being in awe of it because I made it a point to see this film in the movie theater because the World Wars have always fascinated me. The acting was superb. Great actors accept one being over the top. But Shia LeBeouf was amazing. Did not expect to ever play such a mature role with such authenticity. Michael Pena made think of that actual unsung sacrifice that men in war make when he says, ""best job in the world."" Jon Bernthal, what more can we say about this talented bad ass. But Brad Pitt was so over the top that he makes me feel that I am watching an actor trying to be all that and it fails. Just not believable at all anymore. Now I see why people said they were not pleased with him being the hero in ""12 Years of Slave."" He seems like that actor that desperately needs to do his roles in real life but we know he never could do he over projects and over acts. This movie starts out phenomenal but then the scene with the women, so dumb. They meet these women and have them cook, Norman gets a girlfriend and then she is killed. A perfect strike from the SS because the SS is that good. The next war scene is good when the 4 US tanks go up against the 1 German tank. It was an even better scene because of the commander of the last US tank to be destroyed by that German tank before the main characters take that German tank down. I don't know his name but that US tank commander, you could feel the real ness, the fear in his acting. The movie completely bombs at th I end with the Rambo scene where the hero crew takes out about 100 SS with a busted and stranded tank. This is the SS which I said earlier are supposed to be good but all of a sudden they turned into amateurs and shooting ducks for a busted tank. Not to mention the hero crew runs out of ammunition because they left it all outside the tank. Just overall, what a dumb movie because brad Pitt's character acts in the ways and gives orders that no real US military crew would ever follow. Taken on the advanced German tank when it had the element of surprise, and of course taking on 300 SS with a broken tank. This is where Hollywood allows the worse writers and directors and actors that have egos to destroy what could be good art. They don't care about authenticity but about capturing the attention of dumbos."

In a way it feels more like a videogame than a movie because the Germans are hardly depicted as serious fighters but more as easy targets.Watch this movie for the battles, the gore and the great cinematography. This movie has great looks and Brad Pitt shines as the somewhat supernatural tank commander.
However, this is all this movie is, it is cliche and very superficial. Fury does not even attempt to be historically accurate, German towns are nameless for example.
It has hardly any plot and no character development. The main characters are ""team players"" with tough appearance, that's all we learn about them during this movie. In a way this fits with the theme of this movie: war is violent and senseless, no need to know the people because they will die anyway.In short: Great looks but that is not enough to cover the hollow emptiness."
" Yet another movie with characters I don't care about...no matter how hard they tried
",-0.477,-0.9251,2020-06-08 00:00:00,3,"Seriously, I'd rather watch The Battle of the Bulge over and over again (despite its inherent flaws) than sit through this whole film again. I just go to YouTube every now and again and check out the battle scenes for Fury, because they're so darn good.The Brad Pitt character. Awful. But, I never got why he's considered to be such a great actor in the first place. I hope to live long enough to see him with Tom Cruise in one of those movies they make for over the hill actors who go on one last adventure and relive their glory days.The Pitt character treats us to mumbling German, and I don't recall a single German being like, ""Hey, this Amerikaner speaks Deutsch!"". No. They just expect American dog faces to speak fluent German.Could Pitt ever be as cool as James Whitmore's character Sgt. Kinnie in Battleground? Not in a million years. But, lets have him do the brooding thing and put some fake scars on his back and that will make up for it. Oh, and shoot lots of ""Krauts"" that I guess had never been to a rifle range in their lives.Pvt. Ellison, goes from being a rear echelon typist...to a tank crew. Uh, no. Those were highly trained men. To an infantry unit if needed? Sure.The rushed romance between Ellison and the German girl was, uh, I can't describe it...comical? She was scared out of her wits when ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt) and Ellison forced their way into her and her cousin's apartment. But just a little while later, Ellison playing the piano for about two minutes led to sex. No gift of chocolate or nylon stockings needed. Guess the Reich really was very low on manpower by then.Also, why did Collier assume that some German woman looking out a window was a signal for him to go into her apartment with Ellison and look for...I don't know, German soldiers who hadn't surrendered yet? Snipers? Who knows. That scene in the apartment was (mercifully) ended when another GI came up to tell Collier that his CO needed to see him right away. One problem. The messenger was black and U.S. Army divisions were segregated back then. So, the director had to do some PC here I suppose.The other characters? About as one dimensional and interesting as those in Saving Private Ryan (with the exception of Hanks' character which was well fleshed-out). Each one has a gimmick associated with him that takes the place of a personality.The tank battle scenes were quite good. Though I do still wonder how a Sherman managed to survive TWO direct hits from the 88mm cannon of a Tiger tank. The uniforms looked quite authentic as did the equipment. But, as is typical in such movies, the Germans are bad shots. Also, I've seen lots of photos and footage of even Volkssturm volunteers carrying many Panzerfausts (basically they're RPGs) but the Germans in this movie seemed to lack that many of them, or be able to hit a tank 20 meters away. Also, this Tiger had absolutely no support which is not believable.Another good thing about this movie was that it took place in a phase of the war that is usually not dealt with much in other WW II movies. That is, the fighting in western Germany. I suppose The Bridge at Remagen comes the closest as well as the German film The Bridge. Other films include portions of this time and theater of the war such as the beginning of The Sergeant (Rod Steiger), the end of The Young Lions and the last one or two episodes of Band of Brothers.The last interesting thing about this film, and others in the latest wave of WW II movies (say, over the last 30 years) is the depiction of American military men executing POWs. But this, of course, gets drowned out with stuff like, ""Well, they were worse!"". This would not have been allowed prior to Saving Private Ryan, so now the floodgates are open on this issue (see Band of Brothers and Letters from Iwo Jima)."
" Great
",0.6249,-0.9471,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"World War II films are almost a subgenre within cinema, and it is no accident. There is a certain facility in them to oppose good guys and bandits, thanks to the humanitarian crimes committed by the Nazis, which are always present in the collective imagination. In Fury, director and screenwriter David Ayer uses this prior information sparingly. As much as the Second World War brings such an environment beforehand, it is in the combat between men and their psychological reflexes that he is most interested. Especially in the horror that war brings.It is not for nothing that the main character of the feature film is Norman (the competent Logan Lerman), a young God-fearing recruit who falls by parachute on the battlefield. Unaccustomed to the bare reality, he feels the thud and, little by little, builds a certain carcass to survive. Fury follows this entire transition period, from naivety to the realization of how hard life is - especially that life. And in this sense, the context of World War II does not matter - it could be any other, without any difficulty. It is the reality of war that is in focus, any where there is hand-to-hand combat between people.Faced with this situation, the director builds Norman's transformation from his tank companions, Brad Pitt's hardened characters, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pitt and Jon Bernthal. As much as each one has its own peculiarities and distinct needs that often put them in shock, there is also the typical union of those who need support to support all that. Not only on the battlefield, to defeat the enemy, but also on the emotional side. The dynamics of this troop is what is most interesting in the feature film, due to the questions raised from absolutely everyday situations in a war scenario. How would you react to such a situation ?, the viewer may ask himself at various times.To give the air of veracity necessary to this story, David Ayer does not spare the viewer from some strong scenes. The photograph is grayish, a lot of mud on the roads and bodies, blood and body parts here and there. The battles with the tanks give the vibration of the action films, thanks especially to the quality of the sound effects and the ballet of the enemy tanks. There is a commendable technical predicament in the construction of the environments explored along the portrayed journey.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on June 6, 2020."

That ending worked."
" Extreme heroism
",0.5859,-0.3543,2020-06-03 00:00:00,5,"David Ayer has a recent history as an inexperienced and mediocre director, in 'Fury' he again demonstrates his weaknesses.
The premise of the film is based on a group of soldiers in a tank who must receive a new inexperienced and intrepid recruit, with this last description I think we can almost rate David Ayer himself. The director does not risk anything in direction or in writing and simply tells a highly hackneyed and even absurd story as we get closer to the end. The film really has a good start, with a story that promises to be interesting, but at some point near the middle of the film there is a break that causes the film to plummet and not stop until the end. End in which the director exhibits on the screen a heroism so absurd and not very credible that it is not even enough to be enjoyable. The act is so implausible that everything that was right in the film ends up being forgotten by this ridiculous outcome.
David Ayer has nothing more to offer the industry than empty movies, meaningless and logical, full of explosions, action sequences and scripts so absurd and childish that anyone could have written them better. Unfortunately 'Fury' is further proof of the poor quality of this director."

" War Psychology
",-0.5994,-0.9961,2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"It is one of the solid films that compulsorily enlisted, sent to war, describing the psychology of a young man and soldiers in war. You can watch it to understand the psychology of war. If possible, watch the movie high volume, and if you are in a quiet environment, watch it by wearing headphones. The sound effects are really amazing.Now, if you watch a movie by looking for mistakes and prejudice, of course you do not like it and you find mistakes. For example, there were certain errors in the movie Saving Er Ryan: USAAF (American Air Force) used P-47 as a bombardment escort until Schweinfurt'at second air raid, P-51 came after his failure. P-47 began to be used for ground attacks and close support. In one of the movie's most iconic scenes, the P-51s came and blew Tiger. Does this make the movie bad?
But in this movie it is very noticeable. Even in the war of the region, where the Germans left vehicles from fuel, and the Americans also had 7000 aircraft, 2 times more soldiers and unlimited high octane fuel, the Germans killed 19000 Americans for 10000 losses. The Germans caused Americans to lose more in every area, from aircraft to tanks. While a single Stug destroyed 13 Sherman, it was very ridiculous that 3 Shermans 3 rivets tanks destroyed Tiger without air and artillery support.The message to be given in the movie is to give up nothing regardless of life. If you have decided, you should go without giving up.
The main theme of the movie is not that American soldiers do a lot of work, but how bad the war is."
" Another Pitt masterpiece complemented by rising star Lerman
",0.6249,0.9988,2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,"Another touching moment with this war movie 🎥 highlight, this time with Hollywood sensation Brad Pitt. As previously expressed I have developed a genuine love of this type of films. The reasons are they are highly graphic, extremely visual, unquestionably sensational and incredibly real.
As a peace lover and lifestyle enjoyer I find wars very traumatizing. However, like it or not, war, like politics, is tough reality and in some way an inevitable part of the global life. People like you and me are just lucky enough to avoid this reality but not everyone can be so lucky. Hence movies 🎥 that depict wars give you some true feeling of this reality. Maybe not intelligent enough but still an intellectual being, I am deeply interested in history which itself is heavily and consequentially intertwined with politics and wars. To me war movies 🎥 are a show of maturity, masculinity and manhood. What's more, they are also about love, kindness generosity and gallantry which are demonstrated through friendship, companionship, mateship, or even brotherhood, whatever ship you would like it it to be.
Servicemen and women are tough people. Yet they can be gentle and loving people just like average folks such as you and me. They do their jobs as fighters and yet they possess all ordinary humanity sides. I still recall a casual conversation with a defense person on the train 🚂 one day. He basically said, ""When you sign up for defense you pretty much sign your life away."" What great strength, courage and determination you must possess to come up with that decision.
This movie, like many others, are very bloody and traumatic. You see tanks rolling over dead 💀 bodies, machine guns blowing off human limbs and blood gushes down soldiers' faces. Yet it's exactly because of this bloodiness that makes the scenes so real. The plot that a newbie who didn't dare to shoot an enemy from the start but could later become an experienced gunner simply shows you how reality can change people. I always say reality is the best teacher. You get slapped over and over again until you work out what reality is. That's how we learn and grow, isn't it? Yet even from the bloodiest and toughest fight there could still be peace and harmony, love and romance which is demonstrated by Norman (the American soldier) and Emma's (a German girl) shared love of piano and short lived romance. So there is the gentle side of the movie 🎥 out of the toughest themes.
In terms of casts Brad Pitt is undoubtedly a very talented actor. Shia LeBeouf is fairly well known too. Novelty in faces is enhanced by Hollywood rising star Logan Lerman who despite his boyish face acts in a very mature and experienced way.
Overall be it plot, direction, production, special effects and casts, this movie 🎥 ticks all the boxes. Well done Pitt. Whenever it's you in the show I must watch it."

" Macho, macho man
",0.0,0.1593,2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,"There's nothing in this film that you haven't seen in another thousand war movies before. What is perfectly clear is that David Ayer is a hack writer. The story doesn't matter, nor do the characters. The dialogue is laughable. I challenged myself if I could guess the next line, and that was no problem at all. This script is filled to the brim with clichés.If one is to believe the stories about the production of this film, Ayer put his actors through hell, egging them on to be macho a-holes against one another. For someone who used to work in this field I can tell you that it only results in a miserable shoot, not a more authentic product. They're actors, trust them to do their job. Or perhaps Ayer is simply too much of a failure as a director to be able to coax a good performance out of his actors without treating them like dirt.The level of testosterone in this movie is ridiculous. Everyone in the cast is so desperately trying to out-macho one another, Jon Bernthal is painful to watch. Michael Peña is playing the same character that he does in every movie, Michael Peña. He might be the nicest guy in Hollywood, but he keep getting gigs as an actor is beyond me. A pitcher with late stage Lou Gehrig's disease has more range. I have apparently seen some of Logan Lerman's work as a child actor, but it made zero impression on me. Which describes my impression of him in this movie. And Brad Pitt's greatest contribution is inspiring the haircuts of a million Chads.Also, everyone who knows the least bit about World War 2 knows that the ones who mostly bore the brunt against the Nazi forces were the soldiers of the Soviet Union. Any chance Hollywood will make some movies about them?"
" Great movie with some flaws
",0.6249,0.9876,2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie is great, since it depicts war as it should be. There ar no good guys or bad guys, no heroes or villains, just people on the edge on both sides. I really liked how it included authentic and real WW2 vehicles, which boosted the atmosphere a lot. From various kinds of Shermans to the real Tiger borrowed from Bovington tank museum, amazing attention to detail! The scenes inside the tank were amazing, gave a realistic claustrophobic tone, as we can see how the crew lives, fights and struggles inside. The attention to details, like family photos, battle trophies in form of iron crosses or captured weapons, hidden booze it all gives a cool atmosphere. I also liked how the movie did not try to praise the USA or demonize the Germans as a whole and both sides had good and bad people. The acting was superb throughout the whole movie, everyone did an amazing job. Only exception might be the ones playing the US infantry. No soldier would ever shoot like they do.On the other hand there are some serious issues as well. It doesn't seem logical to send tanks against AT guns in a tree line, especially when you do not know certainly where the guns are located. Also the fight with the Tiger makes no sense. It was a common practice by the Germans to target and take out the lead vehicle in a convoy first, then the last one to trap the inner vehicles. The Tiger going forward out of cover was plain stupid. Most likely the Fury should have been knocked down by the first hit as well. The whole scene looked amazing, but made no sense, just like the tree line attack. Same situation with final act. We see the Germans marching with the Panzerfausts (AT rockets) on their shoulders, yet when it comes to using them, suddenly they are stored in boxes for like the second wave. Also the German officer says those are the only ones, yet at the end of the movie you can clearly see more of them. The whole ending is so weird like, why would you send infantry to attack a tank like that? They clearly had all the tools to easily win this fight, but for some reason in this movie the German commander rather has his men mowed.In general the movie is not perfect, but tries it's best to showcase the usage of tanks in WW2. The atmosphere is awesome, the acting is brilliant, only some story elements are illogical, but regardless of those it is a spectacular movie, that is definitely worth to see."
" WOW!

" Thrilling friendship, but laughable battles
",-0.0258,0.8427,2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Up to the end scene, I would be inclined to give this movie a 9. Beautiful scenes, decent global story, good music, but most importantly - a captivating brotherhood of people that have each other's life in their hands. I loved to see how the circumstances push people to become very different - annoying, loud, brutal, primitive... But that's the outer shell - inside, the brotherly bond is always there.However, then comes the ending... Up until here the fighting was already quite Hollywood-esque - the protagonists are always the winners and everybody depends only on them. But then at this end, where all normal people would have run, our heroes decide to stay in a suicide position ""because we are told so"".Very surprisingly, the enemy is retreating for 5 minutes long, and luckily, our 5 heroes can already kill 100 enemies. Also luckily, the enemy forgets that they have anti-tank grenades or that there is a possibility to wait for backup since our heroes are trapped, and sacrifices 100 more units to the stranded but invincible Sherman tank. And who would have guessed, when they find their anti-tank grenades, they cannot succeed again.What's the next step to keep the suspense? That's the unfortunate loss of our heroes. But again, we movie-goers are lucky, because our heroes do lose the battle easily - they die one by one. Even the boss dies! But of course, not easily - because Germans are only allowed to shoot from the front and only one person at a time. Oh, and with large calibre bullets that are actually not lethal. I am so glad that we had such people, I'm sure we've won the war because of a few dozen of such Americans.Anyway, in short: the story of the battles, especially the last one, is laughable. But the friendship that is portrayed throughout the movie is brilliant!"
" Cad's Army
",0.0,0.9602,2020-04-04 00:00:00,3,"Hardened tank commander Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) becomes an unwilling mentor to unprepared novice Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) who is not prepared for war having previously served his time behind a typewriter. Nevertheless Collier guides his men through enemy lines in Germany, but at what cost??So here it is Fury probably one of the most bloated and overrated war films that I've ever seen; instead of offering us an insightful and involving character piece Fury instead became a macho chauvinistic display of empty emotion with most of the characters behaving like the biggest bunch of jerks you're ever likely to see. This is purportedly based on US Tank Crews during the final moments of World War 2 which begs the question; were they all objectionable like the guys depicted here? I have to admit that it was not a lot of fun sitting through this film and the only character I felt any real sympathy for was Norman.So aside from all of this what else happened? Well there's lots of shouting, noise, bravado and of course the US of A killing several Germans. At one point in the film there are some moments of quiet reflection which add nothing and only serve to elongate the film past its already generous 2 hour plus running time.The acting is not much to write home about; the likes of Pena, La Bouef, Bernthal and Pitt are all in the film, but if I'm honest I'd struggle to remember their names or anything about them as this is clearly not important to anyone that made this film. Pitt's character becomes somewhat sympathetic towards the end, but even he is a persona that is hard to endure. Only Logan Lerman comes away as being a sympathetic character (perhaps that was the point), but at least he was someone we could root for.Despite a lot of potential, Fury is far too superficial and thin to become really involved in and, truth be told, when watching the film it looked like I was watching someone else play a computer game so yes pretty uninvolving stuff truth be told."

" A Brad Pitt film, not a WW2 film.
",0.0,-0.9843,2020-03-15 00:00:00,5,"WW2 films are expensive and difficult to make. The biggest obstacle to making a WW2 film is how to source original or replica WW2 equipment. Tanks, in particular, can only be rented from the military body they belong to, so in the making of Fury the US Army would have leased out its tanks for filming - but not without censorship - if the Army does not like the script, they will not approve the lease of the equipment. So producers have restrictions on the stories they will be able to tell.In the case of Fury, although we can marvel at the original Sherman Tanks and uniforms, the script is weak and at times cringeworthy, but worst of all there is a noticable difference in the range of the actors used, with some inhabiting their characters and others who are simply incapable, the introduction of one such character who is poorly cast, ruins the immersion of the film quickly after a stellar action sequence.It also appears that there was no military advisor on set, with many extras shooting bolt-action rifles from the hip.The final scene is comically bad."
" Fake
",-0.4767,-0.9754,2020-03-13 00:00:00,3,"Remarkably unconvincing and un-captivating war film depicting characters and scenarios that defy the suspense of disbelief. Unclear and unengaging set pieces progress for over two hours climaxing into a fully faux film in the final act.As a study in a masculine and macho community it has nothing original in it's ideas or in it's execution as actors struggle to deliver extremely thinly written characters across an episodic and jarring narrative.Possibly intended to work as a tribute to 'soldiers in war' in the general sense and possessing an a-list Hollywood leading man as it's fulcrum, 'Fury' manages to convey dirt and grime quite well but otherwise fails to convince as a cinematic salute to battlefield combatants.Acting throughout is limited by the thoroughly inadequate writing and the direction never overcomes the limitations of both the writing and a questionable production standard.Possibly the editing process was the most extensive stage in the process of making 'Fury'; there certainly seems to be a failure in the focus of the film, I'm tonal and visual consistency that suggests multiple edits and cuts.I rate a 3/10 with the main credit being earned by the fleetingly used female cast members and the military hardware. I would struggle to recommend this except to Brad Pitt fans or war film completists."

So a war film, I find it somewhat surprising that war films seem to be harder to make than war itself, good war films anyway and this is a damn good one, I was surprised to see this was a work of fiction it was very well put together and as authentic looking as modern morality will allow, so watch Fury and then watch it again because though the producers state it's fiction I would bet a good limb that that actions like this happened many times during WW2, it's just they didn't really rate a mention, and while I find that a little sad don't let it detract from a very good film."
" Typical American stereotype without substance.
",-0.3182,0.8093,2020-02-29 00:00:00,1,"I already quit watching the movie after seeing the lousy performance of those two 7,5cm PAK 40 AT guns, which would had ripped all four Shermans to shreds in seconds at that distance. No, the MG42 nest had to fire first (can't imagine why), and all four Shermans drove in a row towards the AT gun nest, surviving without a scratch. Yeah, sure! Normally those AT guns would had got the initiative, plus with an averagely capable crew firing 15 rounds per minute, meaning a 4 seconds reload time for each shell.I later saw the Tiger battle on youtube. No better with the Tiger driving towards the Shermans instead of just remaining in place to maintain accuracy and distance.Would be nice if American's would factor in some true issues the German military had, which wasn't stupid soldiers, but low resources (ammunition and fuel; the Germans even had their ammunition nummarised within each tank, AT gun or artillery piece due to those shortages), while allied forces had air superiority and sufficient ammunition to even constantly bombard and crossroad or important supply route 24/7 with artillery. That WG involvement (counselling?) obviously didn't help much.That movie just is another proof that aside from Clint Eastwood Americans should probably can't and shouldn't do war movies. Also when looking at 1917, or perhaps Dunkirk the British seem to be better at that. David Ayer clearly achieved nothing here."

The acting was superb and their feeling hit you hard, so when they cry - you cry.The sound design from Fury is some of the best sound design Ive ever heard in a war movie. It was overwhelming and so amazing without be a distraction and hard to distinguish what from what.

I know it is #2 for certain.As a USAF Veteran who served during the ""Cold War' roughly twenty years after the end of WWII, this movie was superbly filmed and produced. This film is coarse in some parts; grievous and saddening during other segments.Logan Lerman as Norman Ellison plays a superb role, as does Brad Pitt. Although this film is somewhat mythic, it does reflect/represent the horrors of war. Logan, an Army typist who is sent to the front lines in Germany is an accurate statement about how our U.S. Army will recruit one for a specific specialty; only to send that soldier to God knows where else! (Sorry, Army buds, but that IS your rep even these many years later!)Norman is an innocent lad tossed into the mire of WWII warfare. Somewhat studious and faithful, he has been thrown into a body mangling pit. But, over the period of the movie Norman becomes strong and coarse like his mates.For those of us who like war pics, this is entertaining. Unrealistic, perhaps, but entertaining. There is a raw edge that softens only at the end. Kudos!"

The only ""realistic"" war film to come out of Tinsel Town in my opinion is Ridley Scott's 2001 masterpiece ""Black Hawk Down"" (based on a true account) which beats this garbage (and it's 11 producers and glamorous actors !) hands down in EVERY department ... including the pyrotechnics !"

You are going to be encouraged by the tank unit, in the times of odds against them stood strong even at the roads end . These men backbone was strong. Your backbone will be stronger too and your head will be held high , you will stand tall , your shoulders will be straighter, and you will see Americans won war war 2 because they knew they would be able to endure whatever comes there way. They stood with God as was mentioned many times in the movie. They stood up when the road assaulted there faith . They knew they were going to make a decision. Where they going to leave the road or were they going to actually stay.? This was no ordinary road. It was a road with incredible boldness and a road that would get the admiration of fellow soldiers and seemed more powerful than the administration of God. Little did they know this would be a moment that would define all tank units for the rest of their life's . This was a defining moment as warriors. You Will watch a real modern day scenario that possibly happened and never talked about. These are fiction warrior heroes as well, and some of the best directed we seen. These kind of decisions define who we are in the USA and set the standard for all warriors on the field
These warriors refused to give in and who are willing to stand up for strength and honor and duty and glory and faith . This stand, found others standing strong for many years to come. My hope is that as others saw this it will inspire your faith and encourage people
to inspire your faith and encourage people to make the correct choice when you face your defining momentThis scene transformed tons of others into world master changers for all the other units. The odds were 300 men to 5 men and one loved and lived on to tell the heroism and courage and commitment of the USA 🇺🇸 In times of war.You see this movie had a message and I thought this would be a good way to reach to others or at least get them to think at viewing movies differently.Every single person who has changed the Earth had to leap out and totaly do something risky and with faith. So this is more than just a war movie Today and tomorrow and next year is going to be the day to seize every opportunity you can to be that person who will stand for God against the Earth that enjoys to do be evil at times.Of course during that time the enemy during war time was extremely evil and only few of Germans were true nazis and many negative things were done.God did not give us a spirit that gives us fear but a spirit of power and love and self confidence and self control."

" Could have been so much more
",0.0,-0.99,2019-12-14 00:00:00,6,"The most frustrating part of this entire movie, more than anything else, is that it was so close to greatness, and let a couple of weird lapses in judgment drag it down to ""not a total waste of time but not great at all"" territory.There are lots and lots of subtle little things that this movie likes to do that elevate it above most other war movies. The sky is perpetually grey and cloudy, the times the sun shines are extremely rare, and you better believe that that was intentional. The ""good guys"", the American tankers, are barely-restrained animals, with rotting teeth, frayed clothing, permanent filth in their hair and on their faces, etc. The movie at large does a really great job of showing the more animal side of warfare, insofar as how an extended period of total warfare can twist even the most righteous person into a growling barbarian.The acting is all well above average, to the last actor. Brad Pitt is a personal favorite and as the weird, violent but caring Wardaddy he is a natural. A total prick, a fierce warrior and a harsh taskmaster, he swings between screaming, slavering killer and protective father figure. Pitt himself did a great job of showing that his character wasn't always that way; there is a scene where his civilization shines through and it's actually touching. Shia LaBoeuf does a top-notch job as the proselytizing ""straight man"", trying to stay right with God while doing as much damage to the Reich as possible. It's magical and I honestly feel that this is LaBoeuf's best performance of his life. The scenes where the tank crew jokes around and messes with one another are great and do a fantastic job of showing how close five men can get when they live, fight and die together in a closed, dark and dangerous casket like a Sherman.Why isn't this a 10/10 then? Because for all the amazing stage-setting they do, for all the trials and hardships and laughs we experience with this close-knit tank family, there are a few scenes that are so creatively and fundamentally bankrupt that they completely and utterly obliterate the setting and tone. There is a truly touching and genuinely incredible scene about halfway through the movie, and it makes you think, makes you feel, it's amazing. Then five minutes later there's a huge explosion and that scene is literally destroyed, no reason, no warning. I understand it's probably meant to show how random and senseless war can be, but I left that scene thinking ""man, what a waste of time"". Maybe it just went over my head though.Finally, I'm sure there are hundreds of other reviews about this, but the final scene is so unbelievably stupid it boggles the mind, and I am absolutely gobsmacked that this somehow made it past the scriptwriter. In fifteen short minutes all suspensions of disbelief are instantly dismantled and all the stage-setting that was done is hurled out a window. The dumbest, least sensical ending I have ever seen for a war movie, and I've seen some pretty damn dumb movies.Overall a movie worth watching, but it's more notable for how good it could have been and almost was."

" Brutal tanks
",-0.6249,-0.9942,2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"Tough, wounded men arguing with each other in a metal beast upon a scarred patch of earth. Their tank needs some electrical work before it will move again, and everyone's growing impatient with the increasing sense of danger around them. As we learn later, all four of these men have been fighting in that tank, named Fury, since the Allies first landed in Africa, but now it's 1945. The German war machine is broken but not gone, and Nazis are still trying to protect their homeland as America rolls across the German countryside towards Berlin.I loved how this movie looked. Dirty, grungy, and smoke-filled, it looks like a dirtier Ridley Scott movie. There's one scene where one of the characters gets clean, and the event occurs in the middle of the tense central section where cleanliness ends up feeling wrong somehow. Everyone is always covered in dirt and blood. You can almost smell the weeks of sweat and mud and grease clinging to them.The story is rather simple. The tank, having just lost its assistant driver, picks up a new guy to fill the post. He's been in the army for eight weeks while they've been in the war since Africa. They must go from town to town, engaging what little, but dangerous, German forces are left and ultimately defend a crossroads for the furtherance of the army as a whole. That simple story, though, is supported by a simple element. Its structure is centered around the new assistant driver, our eyes into this world. We are there as he goes from refusing to fire guns on possibly dead German bodies to mowing down lines of SS marching towards the tank. The execution on the journey (some might call it a character arc) is so well executed, and I knew it within the movie's first 20 minutes.At the center of that journey (the exact center of the movie, actually) is the scene where Brad Pitt's character cleans up. The tank has advanced into a German town, wiping out the handful of German soldiers and our main character has joined Pitt by invading a small apartment that houses a middle aged woman and her teenaged cousin. The entire point of the movie is to watch humanity strip away as people wade through war, and seeing these two women cower in fear at these two American soldiers creates a sense of unease and unpredictability. But the scene flows from one emotion to another. Tension gives to innocent love and breaks down into sheer terror. It's a fantastic little journey, as claustrophobic as life in the tank.Outside of that, though, are a handful of action scenes that are completely convincing in their brutality. The standout, of course, is the final battle at the crossroads. Heavily inspired by Audie Murphy's heroic action that bears some similarity to the action on screen, the battle is an extended descent into Hell as battle surrounds a broken down tank housing our heroes.Oh, David Ayer...what happened to you? Immediately after this you gave us Suicide Squad. What happened to the efficient and focused storyteller? I would blame Warner Brothers, but then Ayers gave us Bright."

War and the wholesale slaughter of human life is horrible, and this film successfully portrays that, mostly without glorification, and with unflinching attention to detail of the physical horror. The filth, gore, violence and death of war is shown in graphic details. A great deal of effort went into showing the authentic armour, weaponry and paraphernalia of the period, which combined with the detailed locations, filthy ruined environments and human desolation, paint a realistic picture. Many of the battle scenes feel realistic, with a few exceptions, notably the finale battle which is a borderline ridiculous turkey shoot and lets the film down very badly. The characters and acting are first class, really exceptional, but be warned these are not heroic figures you can feel good about. Be ready for harrowing camaraderie, broken bodies and broken minds. Deserving of praise for its integrity to its purpose, which I think is solely a portrayal of the horror of war."

",0.5106,-0.5715,2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,Once again Brad Pitt is taking names and killing Nazis in this burner of a movie that both succeeds and fails in its attempt at realism in war. The tank shots look too much like Star Wars blaster shots to not be distracted by but the gritty performances of the main characters is engaging enough to keep one interested in their predicament: to ride through Germany in the last days of the war and not get killed doing it. Brad Pitt gives a more human performance than his Inglorious Basterds counterpart. Often savage and in turn paternalistic. At times achieving both. Some of it stretches the boundaries of belief a little too thin but heck it's a lot of fun. There's an odd and uncomfortable 30 minute interlude at a dinner table that is way longer than it needs to be. Other than that the movie moves at breakneck speed.

",0.0,-0.9946,2019-08-02 00:00:00,3,"Good old war crimes to the applause of the ignorant. As a movie it has great acting and cinematography. Maybe a good 'feel good' message you'd expect from the biased end of the hero's/winners, but it denies the truth of history, and is factually inaccurate. Right from the get go Hitler did not declare ""total war"" in 1945 and he did not mobilize all men women and children. He did declare total war in 1943 for materials and goods to be allocated to the war effort. War is harsh, the harshest even of human device, and of course no one wants to root for the historical 'bad guy'. However to glorify dehumanization in this way is also deplorable. If anything this film only affirms how just as guilty the US (who were late to the war to begin with) is of war crimes, and hopefully isn't meant in any way to be historically accurate. Watching this film as an aficionado of history especially pertaining to wars I was left more with a sour taste in my mouth than being entertained.I understand this is a fictional movie based on fictional characters with fictional backstories in a true historical background. But that doesn't justify the glorification and demonization expressed in this movie. Every soldier follows orders, even when they don't know the truth of maliciousness behind them, no army is exempt from that fact. Maybe that was the message?, Didn't translate well."

Nothing makes sense in it.
Germans dug in, in the middle of the field, instead of the end of the forest!
Shermans destroying two camouflaged anti-tenk positions, before being destroyed by them!
End ""Zucker kommst zu lezt!"", sherman tank, known among the german soldiers as ""tommy cooker""(which only advantage over german tanks was it's speed), manages to destroy entire ss unit, while being immobilized!
Fairytale indeed!"

",0.0258,0.9591,2019-06-16 00:00:00,1,When I started the movie it looked good. Also the acting is good. It is filmed like Band of Brothers. But when I got further into the movie it got more and more unbelievable and silly especially the scene with the Tiger and the ridiculous final scene. That's absolutely extremely silly like mentioned in other reviews here. If it were like five or ten SS soldiers the tank crew might have won with extreme luck. Maybe. But so many hardenend SS soldiers with five years of fighting behind them?! It would have been a question of minutes.

" Fury: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
",-0.8225,-0.9907,2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The Good:
War films often look at the machines of combat as cold and impersonal tools. Infantry soldiers mount and dismount trucks and carry themselves from mission to mission on foot. The reality of modern combat, though, is more mobile, more mechanized. But, even though machines can be cold and impersonal, and can remove soldiers from the visceral and traumatic nature of war real intimacy and feeling isn't removed from combat. The film spends a good deal of time inside the tank trying to depict the close bonds that form between a group of men in close quarters put in life and death situations routinely, and it does it well. Although the personalities sometimes clash and we can see the real animosity that exists between them, truer moments shine through when they're asked to fight for each other and against perhaps the greatest evil the world has ever known.The Bad:
The worst part of this film is probably the largely uneven or lackluster performances. Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt, which is regrettable because as the film''s biggest star one would hope for more of a star performance. Jon Bernthal is Jon Bernthal, which is unsurprising. Logan Lerman is Logan Lerman, which is predictable. Michael Cena could have shined, but was given only an awkward monologue that doesn't really connect well to the rest of the film. Shia LaBeouf similarly isn't given much of a showcase in the film, but he does well in the moments that are written for him. He should have had more.The Ugly:
A deeper scan of a list of World War II films would likely generate at least a short list of films that better did what this film tried to do, but the first film that comes to mind for me is Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998). Although Ryan doesn't deal directly with tank combat, it certainly showcases how soldiers in combat can establish deep relationships without regard for the character of brevity that their lives have assumed. All that being said, the performances are also immeasurably better across the board."
" A good movie no needs to be an historical documentary.
",0.1779,0.3314,2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"My score is eight stars. I partially agree with all users that says it's not realistic at all, but i think Fury is actually a movie, not a docu-film nor an historical document.
Anyway it's a very good-acted movie.
One last thing: in some scenes it seems to me to feel the awful claustrophobic atmosphere inside the tanks, even the 'smell' and human conditions of all that guys that, and this is definitely true, have really fought for our freedom."
" A good boys own story with unbelievable ending
",0.5719,-0.8008,2019-05-19 00:00:00,5,"I liked some of this film. The Tiger tank fight was believable. The scene with the German women worked. The dynamics with the crew was ok after a while. But the well concealed anti tank guns failing to make a single hit was unlikely. The film was then ruined by the ridiculous ending with one damaged Sherman and it's crew supposedly taking out hundreds of SS troops. OK the SS didn't have artillery or tanks, but they just ran into the machine guns! And tanks are incredibly vulnerable on their own to infantry - especially well trained motivated troops with panzerfausts!"
" Could've been the new Saving Private Ryan, but missed the mark
",-0.4215,-0.9969,2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I can't remember the last time I was this excited for a war movie. A movie about a tank crew in World War II?! It sounded amazing from the start. Although I must admit I was a little bit disappointed when I heard who they casted for the roles. After Inglourious Basterds I found it hard to take Brad Pitt seriously as a tank commander and Jon Bernthal was still fresh in my memory as Shane from TWD.But nevertheless this couldn't stop my excitement. This was, as far as I know, the only movie about a WWII tank crew made in the 21st century. THIS could be the next Saving Private Ryan. But it didn't live up to my personal hype for numerous reasons.The acting itself was mostly good, but specifically two events ruined the movie for me and that's why I only gave it a 7.1) The Tiger vs Sherman tanks. Let's imagine you are a German tank driver. You have perfect cover and can easily pick off the Sherman tanks one by one. What do you do? Obviously leave the cover and charge at multiple tanks coming at you. Mistake number one. Secondly why do these Sherman tanks don't have infantry covering their every move.It's very hard to observe your surroundings from a tank and it's not that the Allied forces lacked manpower in this movie. Thirdly Fury was equipped with a canon that could easily destroy the German tank. There was no need to circle around it to hit the rear.2) I've had the honour to meet veterans from WWII, Germans, Americans and British. And all these veterans had one thing in common: they just wanted to make it back home alive.It makes the final battle in Fury harder to understand.It's April 1945. All the other tanks that accompanied Fury on their mission to defend a crossroad were destroyed. Fury(the tank) hits a mine on a road near the barn and can't move anymore. Making it an easy target. Norman(a member of the tankcrew) is on a reconnaissance mission. In the distance he sees 200 to 300 SS soldiers with Panzerfausts and other weapons. At this point the movie goes full Hollywood and in a bad way. It makes sense to retreat and regroup with other Americans to fight this enemy. But NO, let's stay in this disabled tank thus an easy target and try to fight off 200 to 300 German soldiers although the war is almost over.It's realistic that they could surprise the first soldiers, because they made it look like the tankcrew was killed. But after that it's one big joke. Stormtroopers would be embarrassed. It's almost like the elite of the German army forgot everything they were taught. The SS soldiers didn't know how to aim, shoot and flank a disabled tank. It was a joke.Obviously everyone, except Norman, dies in this ridiculous suicide mission. I still get angry about how they ruined the ending of this movie."

One of the best war movies of last years, very good plot, and excellent acting. The story is of war ugliness and the ties between people thrown into the hell of war.
One of the people from a US tank team was killed in action. He is replaced by a fresh recruit.
Later the plot accelerates when the US tank encounters the SS regiment and the tanks have to defend the US troops remaining behind.

" Great WW2 Tank Focused Film With Subpar Script
",0.7717,0.3297,2019-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Fury is a great tank flick of a film that focuses on tank warfare, sort of focus that is quite rare. Not only that, I'm pleasantly surprised to see them use genuine Sherman and Tiger tanks (working museum models) which shows they put a lot of care in getting across the historical accuracy of how these tanks operated.With that said, can't say the same for the actual script, tactics and methods used here. My favourite scene being the Tiger battle against the Shermans, and sadly, my least favourite would have to be the ending.The ending was your typical cliche hollywood last stand as the 'heroes' of the film face off against the germans in a last ditch suicidal effort because 'reasons'. Reasons that are never really explained other than a sense of hatred for the SS, and it so happens that an SS Platoon is making their way to them.All in all, a disappointing finish with a last stand that made absolutely zero sense because of the german inability to flank and surround an immobilized tank. But hey, if it made sense, then we would probably get a very different film.And maybe just a slightly better visual experience than what we ended up getting.Regardless, Fury is a great watch up until the ending, and should be enjoyed for what it is; TANKS!"

" More like a fantasy or superhero movie
",0.4201,-0.9967,2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"The movie is about some American Soldiers that are advancing with other troops in their tank further into Germany in a time when the war is already won. The whole plot of the movie is about killing Nazis and Germans and how much fun it is to kill them. Of course the Nazis were bad people and led to a lot of suffering but in this movie I had the feeling that actually the American Soldiers especially Brad Pitt who are portrayed as Heroes are the real evil ones. Killing children and prisoners is a war crime and to show it as something neccessary and heroic like Hollywood does is just wrong.Furthermore the last scene turns the movie into a fantasy film. 5 Soldiers who are almost defeating a whole battallion of SS Soldiers in a broken tank is just a joke.
I know Hollywood likes Superhero movies but they should not claim to make a realistic WW2 Movie then. People might actually watch it and believe this made up hero stories. The Second World War was a terrible time and many million people suffered and lost their lifes. To make such a parody of this horrific war is not appropriate. It is a disgrace to all the people who fought or lost their lifes in a war. I hope Hollywood will not continue making this kind of propaganda movies to glorify war."

That makes the film so great however, giving us a crystal clear mirror into the life inside a tank. The characters all have distinguishable personalities. One is the guy who is scared and doesn't want to kill people. One is the guy that's the leader and has been through a lot, the list goes on, and that's just to name a few. The tough scenes were hard to watch due to the subject matter relating to war. Such as the death of a loved one, comradery, even pstd briefly, and even simply getting adjusted to life in a tank. Much appreciation by the war for using real tanks used in World War II, it added to the realism the movie was going for. The ending to be put into one word, awesome.

That alone makes this the greatest war movie I have ever seen as it portrays real value of human life and not just that of the life of the protagonist which is usually American or British."
" Solid
",0.1531,-0.9791,2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"9 February 2015. Fury has nice pacing, engaging, and a balanced action drama of the tank warfare of World War II. This movie excels in its presentation of war that is both shocking as it is penetrating in its intensity and different perspective of military shells. There is a surprising, almost a futuristic laser blasters visual in the action scenes.This what is an essentially coming of age movie for one young new recruit at the end of the war exposing him to the horrors and delicate negotiation between war's insanity and human propriety. Fury, though doesn't quite have the intricate touch of comedic subtlety and cultural imbalance of Tropic Thunder (2008), nor the epic presentation of Saving Private Ryan (1998), the intimacy and continuous singular battle event focus and intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001) or We Were Soldiers (2002), the comprehensive nature of a predominate war struggle of survival of The Great Escape (1963), the darkness and totality insanity of Apocalypse Now (1979), or the raw, authenticity of Jarhead (2005)."

There is the good old cringe scenes, with the speeches it is a really intense film, if the tank shoot out doesn't make you squeal then I don't know what will. You can see the ending a mile away but you forget about it through the action and excitement of the final battle leaving you reeling with emotions.

There are pointless violence and unrealistic battle scenes. If the plot and the story contains something more meaningful to our intelligence, it would be better.The production is fine for me, who doesn't know much military stuff and doesn't know what the real things are like. The performance of all actors and actresses are solid and believable. Each character has its own personality. But the battle scenes seem silly that the American win so easily and the bullets of the German seem to miss the point all the time in every battle scene.But what I dislike the most about the movie is the idea that war means killing and it's good to kill others whom we consider enemies. I don't like movies that support war and portray killing mass of people as something great and brave. Some of the characters almost look like they enjoy killing. It just makes me feel sad and resentful. Nevertheless, there is a gentle scene with the two German girls that conveys humanity of some soldier characters.

In conclusion, action-movie lovers . patriotic American people, and those who enjoy violence and killing probably like the movies. Peace lovers should stay away."

Ultimately, all you're left with is a collection of depressing scenes, sad moments, and a worldview so cynical that it seems to endorse the surrender of ideals in favor of acceptance and comradery from ones compatriots and in the face of the brutality of the human condition that underlies the farce of civilization."

" For those who feast on comic-book violence, a much welcome wake-up call
",-0.2732,0.9789,2018-09-09 00:00:00,10,"I gave this film a 10 not because it is a great and satisfying narrative film that one would watch over and over but for what it accomplishes. This film is not plot driven, it doesn't need to be as it accomplishes all it set out to do. No punches are pulled in this one. This is an intense character study of mankind's brutality against his own. This is ""probably"" why this film got poor reviews because it doesn't have a plot and the standard Hollywood satisfying ending. It is gut wrenchingly truthful and most people don't want to watch films like this, reminding us how shit the world and humans are. But humans have short memories and they need to be reminded of history. This kind of film is very hard to do, many others have attempted this theme, some succeed but many fall short, not to a lack of trying. To sustain an audiences attention while hammering home its theme is a careful walk along a razors edge. Too much one way or the other and the viewer will tune out. Very few of this generation will have the patience to watch older films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, PATHES OF GLORY or other such B&W classics, but hopefully they will watch this film because of Brad or the war aspect. Whatever drives them to watch this film is a means to an end. Super hero and cartoon violence has its place and are escapist for sure, but too much of that will convince growing minds that that is what war and violence is, this film is a rude awakening to that juvenile thought process. Fury is one of those films that should be shown in schools, watching a film like this and similar films based on real-life drama, is worth more than reading a hundred books on the subject. History is not dead, it should be re-booted as often as possible to remind the younger generation that the world they live in has not always been this way and simply taken for granted that it has. As much as my life revolves around film, I know life is not a movie. I know the difference. Those that don't, are in for their own rude awakening at some point in their lives. This film reminds them that peace and freedom has the highest price."

starting off with the most positive aspect of the movie, the sets and set designs of the film are fantastic, from the prop design to the locations and sets used, this film really shines when it comes to the visual aspect. EFFECTS
The effects are on the whole pretty good, except for the gunfire, which is pretty laughable, and looks like it came straight out of Star Wars and not World War Two. CHARACTERS
There might as well not be any as we've seen them all before in every other war movie. Brad Pitt, John Bernthal and Michael Pena have proved themselves good actors in the past but no one brought their A-game to this movie, with Brad Pitt turning in one of the most mediocre performances of his career.SCRIPT
The script ranges from average to boring. When a character re-tells a war story it usually tells us a bit about the character as well as providing context to their past experiences with war and how they feel about what they've done and how it has affected them and is affecting them now. In this movie this trope (because that's what it is by now) is used for no other purpose than making the audience and main character feel uncomfortable, and tells us pretty much nothing about the characters.PACE
The pacing is all off, start stop start stop start stop, one minute we're watching a tank division bond in the battlefield the next we're sitting round a table with two characters who can't speak English (and might as well not be there) and talk to us about, what amounts to, a whole lot of nothing.MUSIC
It sucks and is used in all the wrong places, musical cues are completely off and kill any tension scenes build up. Not to mention it's probably the most uninspired score i've ever heard.RELATIONSHIPS
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
I get it, war sucks but saving private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Apocalypse Now and We Were Soldiers are all war movies with likeable characters and probably pay better respect to the American military than this movie does (as a non-American I'm curious as to how Americans view this film's portrayal of their military).
Not to mention that this film possesses one of the most insulting sex scenes in film history, when Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS has more tasteful sex scenes than your movie, then you know you've made a mistake.
The first real female character to appear in the movie and she's little more than just something to be exploited, a more intelligent movie could have made this into a good point about how treats all men and women like objects but it's here just to create conflict within the platoon and no other reason. -The main dynamic of our main crew is also laughable, ""we bond through our masculinity"", ""we shout a lot"", ""we're mean but still human underneath"". 
It may have worked if Logan Lerman had more of an arc rather than it being split between Lerman and Pitt, Pitt's an established enough actor to take a backseat role, he's done it before, but I'm pretty sure he just wanted an Oscar. I like Brad Pitt but he should have been more of a supporting role.PLOT
Was there one? If you want to make a Nihilistic movie fine, they've worked before but what was going on, they drove to a town, killed some Nazis, rinse and repeat.
There's also this ridiculous scene where 200-300 Germans are marching towards a broken down tank with 5 guys in it, and they decide to stay and fight, saying ""I didn't run before"".
WHY. Long Lerman has been in the war for about a day and now he's ready to fight and die with men that he barely knows despite never showing he held these values before.
Also - you pride yourself on killing Nazis, so you decide to throw your life away to kill some more knowing you're going to die, even though they could have run, so they let the Nazis kill them, and get a moral boost as they took down a tank. (Okay they slowed them down from attaining the town behind them but they didn't have any artillery with them, as it is clearly stated in the script) so the marching battalion was woefully unprepared to take a town in the first place. HISTORY
""Settle down we hit a mine that's all"" - so we'll just wander round like the people who set the mine aren't here despite the fact we established that we shoot corpses to make sure they're really dead - what? Who wrote this?
The history is hard to judge as inaccurate because the backdrop of the war is ignored, we're in a small part of Germany where the key points of the war are far away so it's hard to have a go at the film for accuracy.
I'm no military historian; so the props, dress and colloquialisms are beyond my judgement for historical accuracy but it distances itself from the key areas of the war enough so that it couldn't really be inaccurate.
The Germans are also dehumanised to the point where they might as well have been the Orcs or Uruk-hai from the Lord of the Rings, not all Germans were Nazis and we get it NAZIS WERE BAD, how about putting some humans in there among them.USA
I like the USA, I have American friends, I like American movies and a lot of my favourite actors are American, but would it have hurt to show some other nations (you know Europeans, because that's where it takes place, who aren't the Germans to be mowed down). 
I think it's safe to say we're all a bit sick of USA's World War Two shown in movies, but like I said its not a real problem and is a nit pick on my behalf.EMOTION
I felt nothing when the characters died. And when Brad Pitt is ""dying"" he's sitting there like he's just got back from a long day of work and is gathering his engery back up, rather than facing his own mortality and reeling from being shot three times by a sniper.
Lerman's character also places his coat over Pitt's body and no one else's despite them all bonding, but Pen, Berthnal and LaBeuof aren't A-listers so their characters mean nothing."

He knows nothing about land warfare in Europe in 1945. His mil experience was in the modern US Navy.He knows nothing about the people/men who fought through Europe in 1944-5. So what he has done is to transpose LA Gangs into a 1945 American Sherman tank in Germany.The Brad Pitt Gang inside his tank, with followers in other Shermans... and the enemy German 'gang' outside his tank.his crew all act like 'gang members' not soldiers. This is what i couldn't fathom until I looked up Avery's page on wiki. They don't think, talk or act like soldiers, but like 'gang members'.I'm 65 and I grew up on WW2 movies. Both classic and more modern. Both English/American and foreign. This bears no resemblance to any of them.It's Brad Pitt's movie... Brad Pitt's Gang against the German gangs outside. Esp, the SS Gang. So his crew talk and act like movie gangsters, not soldier. There is a nastiness, meanness, and grimness that seems far more gangland than 'soldierly'. Al the soldiers in this movie are filthy all the time. In reality, soldiers in combat took pains to remain as clean and healthy as possible therefore combat effective. This despite the mud and blood everywhere. Part of a soldiers pride is to keep himself his weapons and his surroundings pragmatically clean and serviceable, always. These guys are not soldiers, and do not look like soldiers after 1 week of boot camp and other stuff Avery has them do to 'enhance their meanness and nastiness'. BS!these guys wouldn't survive a real war. They'd be mental cases inside a month. They haven't enough humanity to balance the horrors of war around them. Avery has made them into ;gang nastiness'. Esp. the scene where he forces the young recruit to commit a war crime, with all the other soldiers cheering him on. This is SS territory, not American. But Avery apparently knows not the difference. Its all 'gangs' to him.And of course the Germans lose every battle. This is total nonsense. The Shermans were useless against most German tanks and anti-tank weapons, which is why Sherman crew casualties were so huge. They needed the AF to destroy their enemy. So all the combat scenes are quite stupid.To sum up...dumb, nasty, stupid 'LA gang in Sherman tank 1945'... best avoided. Try Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers for more fitting tributes to the generation that fought in WW2."

What the film is mostly about the horrors of WWII and reflection of how the US saved Europe from the horrors of the Nazi regime. It shows how people sacrificed their lives for a greater good.

" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.8488,2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Don't make the error to be fooled by what the title says... This isn't a war film. Its a action movie that just happens to be taking place in WW2 Germany.Let's start with the Only somewhat redeeming qualities I can say. It is indeed gritty and dirty, and doesn't do much justice to the characters. Even Brad Pitt's ""Wardaddy"" character, he is apparently a war criminal even. Shoots a German POW to the back of the head in cold blood. Also, it is impressive to see all the tanks and weaponry etc - considering especially that a real German Tiger was provided for this movie. The only Tiger tank still in working condition, Tiger 131 from Bovington museum in the UK.Now the bad stuff.Acting is very obviously forced by the actors, and although none are particularly bad actors or do that bad a job presenting their characters, they act more like caricatures ( or stereotypes, depending on who is portraying whom ) of people, than like normal humans. The film has long periods where nothing happens ( notably the 2 German women's house ) cut by scenes of fighting which are very unrealistic - Notably, ""Fury"", Brad Pitt's tank, takes 2-3 hits from a Tiger and survives, all the Germans in the film have forgotten how to operate anti-tank weapons, etc. The last scene especially is by far the worst - and could be summarized in this sentence: around 200 Hapless Germans run around a lone immobilized Sherman tank like headless chickens, and are getting mauled in the process by Brad Pitt handling a machine gun and Shia Labeouf throwing grenades from a hatch.Note: Brad Pitt can be killed, but apparently he is indestructible. 2 grenades exploding to his face, inside a tank even, and he is still whole. What is he made from ?Anyways, If this is your idea for a historical war drama, then sure go ahead watch this film. Otherwise avoid it like the plague, it is ridiculous."

",-0.34,-0.9951,2018-06-30 00:00:00,10,"As usual, the liberal arts minded and those who never have served in the military rate this move low - as low as their practical experience goes with regards to war, real men and the real world as it exists. The movie tempers the horror that is and always should be war. There is no mercy save in the minds of the politicians who make these wars and the cube warriors studying it from afar. Kill or be killed is the least of one's problems, as duty calls for more, much more of a real man or woman these days as in the past. Is there anything you liberals would lay your life on the line for save sex, drugs and illegals and your New World Order?This is about the core values every person who is a true citizen must have, not just in war but in life. What defines oneself is what one does, not says. Somethings like America, a whisper among the screams of a violent world, call for a citizen to sacrifice for the whole, not the one. This movie shows the collective good and such patriotism in a desperate and socially separated group fighting for more than just each other - and these movie critics and their college-knowledge campus rats just don't get it, and never will.The only thing worse than tank warfare is war at sea as both call for massive loss of life but coordination beyond pulling a trigger or stick.Fury - best describes in the mind of this Mustang officer of two wars what war is all about and what this film gives you cowards back home a glimpse of.You sell your country and citizenship so cheaply, as what skin have you ever had in the game? And electing a socialist bimbo in New York says it all - like her, you are not truly Americans."

For me it's one of the best film I have seen, an excellent casting (Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf...) with amazing acting. This film is really moving, we can project us in the violence, the difficulty of living during WWII. Logan Lerman's role puts us in the place of a young soldier between joy of youth and horror of the war. Fury is really realistic it's like if we were here with them on the battlefield, we can feel tension because of the danger of their mission.
I think we can't really imagine what soldiers lived and this film is not just about heroic soldiers, don't forget they are just humansI have no other arguments so please JUST WATCH FURY"

It is quite a brutal movie who shows without censure the horrific nature of war, the battles scenes are very realistic and that it a plus. It also shows us that no matter the issues, the brotherhood between the soldiers is at the center of their survival.
However, expcept the morbid scenes, this movie does not teaches us anything about the events of world war II and is very biased on a specific point of view.

The rest of us in the room agreed with him wholeheartedly and in fact, some of us had voted to stop it before then but he kept hoping it would get better.I remember the exact moment he, and the rest of us gave up on it; the scene were they're eating a meal with the German women in their apartment and acting like knuckle dragging Neanderthals, My Uncle told us, almost in tears, that no one he ever saw in the service acted like that toward Germans or anyone else, they never executed prisoners in cold blood, not that he ever saw although he admitted it may have happened he knew it wasn't common. Overall they were just trying to do their jobs, stay alive, and come out of the war alive with their sanity, their humanity and their minds intact. This movie disturbed him, and the few service friends he has left, greatly and I'm sorry he ever saw it.I wasn't expecting much going into this movie to begin with because Brad Pitt is a terrible actor and overall, his movies aren't that good. And as bad an actor as Pitt is, he looks like Lawrence Olivier compared to Shia LaBouf who's also in the movie and overacts in every single scene he's in, possibly in an attempt to conceal that fact that he can't act...If your anti-American and/or anti-military this is definitely the movie for you, enjoy! If you believe that all allied soldiers in WWII should be honored for doing an incredibly dangerous job as well as they could and helped keep the world free avoid this movie completely because it will make you ill.And if you know anything at all about history, you know...history? As in the actual recording of facts, occurrences and events as they actually happened, you'll know that this movie is nonsense from beginning to end. It seems a lot of reviewers here seem to think Hollywood's version of WWII is what really happened. In defense of this piece of trash they reference other Hollywood movies, not documentaries or history books...other movies. If that's the extent of your knowledge of history then I submit to you that you're opinion of this movie is worthless. And in reading through all those reviews I solved the mystery of how this terrible film could have such a high rating on IMDB; the positive reviews are repeated over and over and over again. I read some positive reviews four and five times...while the negative ones seemed to only appear once. I wonder what is happening there?It's just a shame that a clueless dolt like Brad Pitt and everyone else involved, got the green light to dis-respect WWII soldiers with this project, I wouldn't expect him to understand that, I doubt he has the sense god gave a donut and Hollywood is generally anti-military, and at times anti-American anyway, but somewhere along the way someone should have realized that this piece of drek was an insult to the men and women who served, and those who died, in World War II."

The very final scene, when one immobilized Sherman remains alive for half a day, disgusts the film with its unreality. However, like many American military films. In order to make films about the war, it is necessary that this at least somehow correspond to historical reality."
" Well made and authentic, with ""Beast of War"" one of the best WW2 tank movies ever made.
",0.34,-0.9992,2018-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Probably earns itself a spot in one of the top 10 war movies ever, if only for the great effort made at historical accuracy. The genuine Sherman tanks used in the movie, along with one of the only running Tiger tanks left in the world, really give this movie a fantastic historical feel. That, and the fact that they do not try to portray American troops as real ""good guys"" as they murder surrendered prisoners and do other things not so nice. I don't doubt these incidents occurred in World War 2, as they do in every war - but there are some genuinely ugly moments in this movie that taint the movie slightly - no doubt as intended, since real war is a million times uglier. Nevertheless, the story has enough scenes to give you something close to a feeling on what being an American tanker in WW2 was like. The movie moves along briskly from the beginning, and never slows down for long, especially not with excess character development - but enough is revealed about the main characters to show that the tank crew believes they are all more or less a collection of doomed men. The crew know they are probably going to die before the war ends - it's 1945 and the Germans are fighting harder then ever, now that they are on home ground - and their every word and action reflects this idea. So it's no surprise that we will take on the viewpoint of the newby of the group. Norman (Logan Lerman) is a GI that's ordered into Fury (the Sherman tank and the real star) as a radio operator when their last one is KIA. .. and it's Norman's eyes we see the movie through, since he is just as unprepared for what is going to happen as we in the audience are. Sent to stop German forces in a last minute defensive action, Fury and her fellow Sherman tanks face German army and SS troops in a virtual whirl-wind of crashing violence and furious attacks from a desperate enemy. There's nothing to say about this in a review without ruining the movie, but there were several glaring errors in the portrayal of wartime events...nothing bad enough to spoil the movie, but just enough to be annoying to WW2 history/weapons buffs. For instance, we are several times shown columns of marching German troops, who are heavily armed and are equipped with several Panzerfausts (German one shot bazookas) yet not once is one of them even fired at Fury! Moreover, ""War daddy"" (Brad Pitt) is shown popping out of the commander's hatch of Fury and firing a captured Sturmgewehr MP 44 (German assault rifle) at enemy. 
There is nothing truly wrong or unauthentic with this - all sides often used captured weapons, but an MP44 would be a very clumsy weapon to be used from the hatch of a Sherman tank (or any tank). This particular rifle was over 3 feet long, and using it from a tank hatch would be very impractical and would seem to involve quite a lot of fumbling. It would also be ridiculously slow to bring into action (tank crews were usually armed with .45 1911 pistols or M3 Grease gun submachine gun for this reason, NOT a full size rifle - even a carbine would really be too long).Despite the few (very few) silly aspects and historical inaccuracies that happen in this movie, overall this is one of the very best tank movies ever made (the only better one is ""The beast of war""). ""Fury"" is a very good war film, and definitely worth a watch by any war movie fan."

He is best known for working as a writer and/or director on a lot of excellent police thrillers. Besides the cinematic abomination known as Suicide Squad, I enjoy the movies he works on. This is unlike a lot of more one dimensional jingostic WW2 movies. The film is very gritty and violent and portrays a fairly bleak view of survival of Brad Pitt and his crew fighting the Nazi's and doing their best to survive inside a Sherman tank, which is inferior to the tanks driven by the enemy. This gives a fairly sound depiction of the horrors of war and what these men must endure. The performances are very somber and very good. The actors had great chemistry. The overall tone and mood of the film brings to mind the band Discharge, which would be a good aural companion piece to the film. Fury is a very good film, that is solid and well made."

The guts, the glory, Brad Pitt is horribly scarred. And Shia's character loves Jesus. God Bless America! Check out the German that is actually stupid enough to stick his head in that tank!Predictable.Could write a short book about how it was unrealistic.The scene where the young soldier goes into the bedroom with the young Fraulein (and Brad Pitt's character saying ""If you don't take her in that bedroom, I will"") raised my eyebrow knowing the history of the period. Tens of thousands of German women were raped by Allied troops-mostly Russians. Many committed suicide afterwards.American troops illegally executing German prisoners is presented as something normal and accepted. In reality Brad Pitt would have found himself in the Brig. Shooting them down during the heat of battle, even if they are just standing there unarmed, is one thing. Some times during heated action you cannot take prisoners and you cannot leave them behind alive. But cold-bloodedly shooting them after they were taken prisoner was not allowed. SS Concentration Camp guards were summarily shot by Allied troops, however. Some allied troops claimed they would shoot SS who tried to surrender. Officers didn't want this happening for good reason. Because it could cause reprisals against Allied POW's. And they could also face court martial or have their records permanently besmirched if these things were done by men under their command.They would never have put such a Greenhorn in a driver's position with zero training. Because a Sherman is not easy to drive and takes practice. They also must have practice on the guns and learn various maintenance duties. In a combat situation on-the-job training on a tank is like suicide.I laughed when Pitt's character said ""I love it in here."" Those Shermans would get up over 100 degrees and stink like diesel fumes. Nobody liked being inside them. All it takes is a 12-year-old to pop up out of a ditch with a Panzerfaust and your entire crew gets lit up like human torches. And he loves it in there? Get real.I laughed when they hit that mine and Brad asks ""Can you fix it?"" And he says he can. There's no way he's fixing that with out outside help and equipment!!! It's beyond ridiculous to think a disabled Sherman tank would take on an entire SS Battalion. Anybody that did that would be mentally ill. They would run. Any Officer would order them to scuttle the tank and destroy its ordinance. An experienced tank crew would not be sacrificed like that with out specific orders and a special reason. And it would not be necessary for any reason. At this point in the war we were destroying battalions with just aircraft. The U.S. Army crushed an entire SS Armored Division with just artillery. Nobody needed to make desperate stands with a Sherman."
" Strong performances and special effects pick up the slack of this schnooze-fest.
",0.7184,-0.8963,2018-04-24 00:00:00,6,"This movie really shows how well Brad Pitt has aged as an actor over the years. He and Shia LeBeof really give great performances that add to the suspense. Brad Pitt is a laser-focused combat officer with a certain vinegar-laced personality, and Shia LeBoeuf plays a religiously inclined main gunner who is perhaps his second-best soldier. 
This story moves along too slowly for my taste. There's alot of stopping and starting in the action, and at least one scene we see in every war movie: soldiers bust in to someone's home and take advantage of their food supply and recharge their batteries. One of the crew has a romantic relationship with a German girl in the home he busts into. It might be a real experience in war but I think I've seen it one too many times. 
The one thing you WON'T get in this movie is any sort of epic tank battles such as made the theatre of the Atlantic Campaign famous. The movie starts out inside the tank after a mission, and the forward machine gunner is killed; all you see is his bloody neck stump and spine sticking out which is graphic. 
I reduced one star because this movie has moments where the action isn't that great. In a couple of scenes guys are getting blown up everywhere, and in real life there would be grunts and cries for mommy and, well, internal organs lying everywhere, but in this movie they clean it up too too much. I heard that the insides of those Sherman tanks looked like slaughterhouses at the end of a mission! There is the one crew member who gets a Panzerfaust rocket cut straight through his abdomen, but very little guts and grizzle are seen! Another guy leans into a German grenade, but again, there should be blood everywhere, but there isn't!!!!! 
There's alot of German language in this movie. As having taken four years of high school German, I can appreciate that part of it. But still, this movie's setting takes place later in the Atlantic Campaign, so there's really often times no direction in this. Very much feels like the film stops where it starts and starts where it stops. There are a few tank battles but are so brief that you tend to get bored. 
Also, the German gunners in that one scene are firing into the tanks, and miss three times in a row!!! No way that is true; I happen to know that the Germans were reknowned for their accuracy and the Sherman was an easy target."
" More like a video game than a movie
",0.4201,-0.8834,2018-04-16 00:00:00,3,"A product of the video game culture I think. If you want non-stop action, its here. However this movie is masquerading as a wwII flick. Much of the movie is from inside or just outside a Sherman tank. This makes about 1/5th of the movie claustrophobic, not unlike a submarine movie. Its this intimacy of a close knit group of men that is the strongest suit of the movie.The movie seems to try to explain how innocent young men become ruthless killers. With a couple of the American characters portrayed as complete animals. Perhaps more ruthless than the SS themselves. The film is shown more through a young American recruit who only has office training. He gets thrown into a tank and loses his virginity on the battle field and literally later on. His innocence is played off the animalistic crew members who resent him for not yet seeing the cruelty of war. They try to destroy his innocence. This happens in everyday life as well, but is more obvious in this movie. I just can never get over how the tank captain doesn't button up the tank in such obvious situations. Such as numerous sniper opportunities in towns, traveling on roads right next to heavy woods.....etc. Obviously it is to create scenarios that the script requires. The violence in the movie is realistic and maybe over the top for shock value. The utter disregard for caution by the lead tank and the German SS battalion at the end is beyond belief. This movie just uses the wwII setting to set up impossible situations to create the main hero.The one tender scene in the middle of the movie is just there to contrast against the brutal animals in the tank crew."

" Brad Pitt's Fury
",-0.5719,-0.9779,2018-03-01 00:00:00,8,"In my opinion , this is one of the best World War 2 film's I have ever seen. Brad Pitt commands a Sherman tank with a five person crew on a very scary mission behind enemy lines in Germany. Throughout this whole movie it shows how one man's morals can change in a very short time due to a traumatic change of event's. We can see the struggle and pain Brad Pitt (Don Collier) feel's when he is forced to train a young rookie soldier ( Norman Ellison ) how to shoot through a tank and be able to spot and kill the Nazi's. I can tell that the pain and suffering Brad causes the young soldier remind's him of what he had to go through at that age. The whole movie show's perfectly the awfulness and inhumane nature of the war against the Nazi's in Nazi Germany, and the father and son kind of bond that Brad Pitt and the young soldier have together. In the movie it also shows the awfully scarring moments for all the soldiers and how awfully they cope with their emotions. It's a thrilling and heart pounding movie that I think alot more people should appreciate."

",0.8519,-0.978,2018-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Fury is a cliche-ridden, unrealistic, disturbing World War II film.The film's disturbing not because of its violence and nature of war, but because of the view of the personalities we are presented with. At first we have to deal with an annoying character who won't do his job, has a tantrum and responsible for fellow soldiers being killed. The rest of the crew turn out to be much much worse. The crazy nut job guy probably should of got a bullet in him by the kid. It's an action war film, so its engaging regardless, but the last battle scene's utterly ridiculous. If 200 troops can't take out one stationary tank, why are they walking down that road in the first place. Either you have the equipment to take it out or you don't. If you do, it shouldn't take long, if you don't, you don't engage with it. The best part of the film was with the two women, but it's all so fragile in its timing, if the crew walk in a bit earlier or they're in the building when it's hit or many of the situations where everyone around them is getting hit but them. It all would play out very differently. The enemy flashes a light on Norman under the tank at the end and pretends he sees nothing, they really should of come back and dragged him away. Why does it always have to be a happy ending. The crew that we are with are a vulgar bunch, yet the only depiction of the enemy's kind."
" What a waste
",-0.4215,-0.8972,2018-02-17 00:00:00,4,"Yet again a US film which puts in the resources to recreate realistic elements of scenes, equipment, weapons, towns, etc, and yet again a film which ends up focusing on a bunch of cry babies with imaginary friends. Why does Hollywood spend so much time delaying action to ensure that the audience can see that characters have feelings? Why assume the audience has a very low emotional IQ? The film is ruined by the entirely unrealistic final overlong scene, where five US troops hold up several companies of Germans, who strangely put themselves in fairground style positions to ensure they will be shot, have a sniper who is strangely inaccurate from short distances, troops who do not know how to use antitank weapons, and who are entirely incapable of dealing with a single crippled tank."
" Another unrealistic propaganda
",-0.25,-0.9942,2018-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Well, I am a fan of histrory, and I was expecting some good war movie like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or Thin Red Line. Fury is a big disappointment. Essentially it tells us a story a tank crew of 5 soldiers during the last months of the American invasion of Europe. Those soldiers are just invincible champions who essentially kill thousands and thousands of enemy combatants whithout making any mistakes, while the Germans are shown as a bunch of incompetent weaklings who never hit their targets, and when confronting a stronger enemy, (like ""Fury"", the war tank that gives the movie its name), instead of approaching cautiously, and trying to minimize their casualties, what they do is just marching towards it and getting wiped out by the tank's machine gun.I don't understand how come such imbeciles could offer any resistance. And they don't explain how the war lasted so long with such an easy foe. The real reason they lost was that they were numerically outnumbered, and were lacking supplies and military equipment. It is just plain brainwashing, trying to portrait the American soldier as brave and ruthless, sinxe they essentially murder unarmed prisoners of war just for pleasure. It is funny that if it was that easy, the Vietnam war would ended with an American war. The movie ""Fury"" feels like a tool for convincing tje audience to support adventures abroad (like we saw recently in Iraq), since the U.S. military always know what is doing, and the foreing populations are not composed of human beings, but just irrational animals who deserve to be killed. I think this film could be misused by a government that wants to re-write history. There is only 2 German actresses in the movie who are not shown in a negative light, and obviously both of them die because the point is that if you are German, you deserve to be punished. It is so much sadism,so much unnecessary killing that I don't understand why in real life Germans were defecting to the American side instead of the Russian side. Fury is so innacurate an illogical that I will not recommend to anyone I know. I prefer ""letters from iwo jima"" by Clint Eastwood, or ""USS Indianapolis"" by Mario Van Peebles as better examples of realistoc war movies that portays blth sides as human."
" Lerman Shines
",0.0,-0.9968,2018-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Fury follows a bad-ass tank crew and its bad-ass, grizzled, Nazi-hating, SS-killing leader, Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). A new kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the team - pretty much against his better judgement. He's never seen the inside of a tank before and hasn't even fired a gun since basic training. He's quite certain there's been a mistake and just wants to go home.Norman is a military-trained typist. An excellent, experienced typist; 60-words a minute he can go. A worthwhile skill to have when you've got a superior officer dictating a memo, but does it work when you've got an entire division of Nazis shooting at you? Not exactly. Norman is teased relentlessly, and mercilessly slapped around by Wardaddy because he refuses to kill anyone. Norman's crewmates believe he'll get them all killed one day, and there's plenty of opportunity for that. Wardaddy is well respected by the Oldman (Jason Isaacs, whom you won't even recognize) and it's Wardaddy's crew that always get the call when there are Nazi's that need killing or Allies that need rescuing; a task that Wardaddy ruthlessly, and violently, carries out with gusto and a 'take no prisoners' attitude.Fury shows the horrors of war quite explicitly. There is enough blood and gore in this movie to make any horror film make-up artist blush. I'm confident in saying that the actions displayed on screen in Fury happened in real life during the war - during any war - even though this particular story is fiction. It's that realism that makes this film sometimes hard to watch. 'War is hell' to quote William Tecumseh Sherman. Everything is so realistic and so genuine it's nauseating.I began to hate Brad Pitt as this movie went on. He plays quite a jerk. You'll hate him too (if you don't already for some other reason). Same with Jon Bernthal (that's the guy who played Shane in The Walking Dead). He's a creepy war machine without a conscience. Shia LaBeouf plays a depressed bible-quoting, war-weary soldier, and you know something else, he's really good in this role! I was surprised, actually, because of, you know, his frequent meltdowns I figured he just went crazy and stopped acting. His character is a troubled and emotional young man, so it's not too far from reality (and the cut on his right cheek is real and self-inflicted prior to filming the movie). Logan Lerman is awesome. He's come a long way since The Butterfly Effect (2004), and I much prefer to see him in an intense role like this, surrounded by so much talent. Lerman feeds off the other actors and you can see it.Sound mix is awesome, so is the cinematography (same guy who shot Suicide Squad and End of Watch). There is a good scene when some tanks get into a battle with some stubborn Nazis. There is one shot in particular that is awe-inspiring. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. It's quite stunning. I don't use the term 'awe-inspiring' very often.Overall, good movie, watch it when you can."
" This isn't your DC's Ayer

In fact, I'm willing to go on record as saying that Suicide Squad is possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen, so I really wasn't expecting a lot from ol' Davey-boy. My expectations were proven wrong almost immediately. The vibe is gritty without being melodramatic, the characters are interesting and well-written, and the plot kept me fully invested throughout. Even better, the film (mostly) steered well clear of the ""brave soldiers"" trope, presenting both the Americans and Germans as humans and not stereotyped cartoon characters. A quick glance at previous reviews mostly yields up the word ""unrealistic"", and in all honestly the final scene deserves every complaint it gets. Didn't stop me from being thrilled by every second."

History is violent.""He commands a diverse group. There is Animal (Jon Bernthal) an Hispanic (Michael Peña) and a born again (Shia LaBeouf) . Norman (Logan Lerman) i.e. ""normal"" joins this group as a green soldier who is reluctant to kill. Collier must transfer the meek soldier into a killing machine and rather quickly through whatever unorthodox method as necessary.The group is doing mop up work at the end of the war with 1,000's of Germans surrendering, yet they still meet the occasional sniper and pockets of resistance.The film lets you know that war and Jesus don't mix. In the opening scene Pitt rides in on a horse and I couldn't help but think, ""WOW! Joey really is a tough ""War Horse."" The film has action, drama, theme, and bit of humor.

All the 'let em burn' stuff borrowed from private Ryan. If you want to watch a good film about being stuck in a tank behind enemy lines, see LEBANON , about the 1982 Israeli war."
" Solid, realistic war film, if unspectacular
",-0.5106,-0.9747,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Fury' is set right at the end of World War II, with the American's slowly forcing the Nazis back towards Berlin. This is different to lots of WWII films, since it's not D-Day, or the Western front, or Pearl Harbour - it's just five guys in a tank, driving across Germany, fighting Nazis when they appear. And that's the film's strong point - it's very realistic. There's death, mud, weary soldiers, fleeing civilians and prisoners everywhere.Sure, it wasn't filmed in Germany (England instead), but the costumes and sets look believable. There's really only three battle scenes, with the reality of war (lots of waiting around) being illustrated to full effect. And while probably accurate, the drawn out interludes of no action make the film longer than necessary - I think this would have made an excellent 1 hour 45 min film, rather than 2 hours 15 min.Don (Pitt) is not actually the main character - it's really about new recruit Noman (Lerman) and how he fits in with this tight Sherman tank crew, and more importantly, how he deals with the horrors of war and killing other humans. The tracer fire looks great on the screen, but there's not enough action or incentive to care for the characters and their mission to make this a classic war film. See 'Patton' if you haven't!"

Terrible and real face of the ww2 is depicted with some excellent directing and impressive acting. I had a feeling that I was with them in the tank. Scenes are brutal, surreal and disturbing.

" Simple And Straightforward With Some Excellent Tank Battle Scenes
",0.2732,-0.9987,2017-12-07 00:00:00,7,"If you're looking for a deep and well developed plot, then ""Fory"" will probably disappoint. It's a very straightforward and even simple story of an American tank crew in the last days of World War II. Battle hardened and perhaps a bit cynical as a result, these Americans for the most part are not the honourable heroes that American movies usually portray. They've become as vicious as anyone else. They'll mercilessly kill their prisoners, they'll rape German women. There's repeated reflections on how bad the SS are whenever they're encountered - but under the surface there's a sense that this particular tank crew at least isn't all that much better. They kill indiscriminately, with little hesitation and few attacks of conscience. It's all to paint a broad picture of war as brutal and ugly. It dehumanizes warriors, turning them int killing machines. It's a very bloody and graphic and violent movie, featuring some of the most vicious tank battles I've ever come across on film. It isn't a movie that's going to give you the warm fuzzies, nor does it create heroes. It's not a very likable movie - and yet, I enjoyed it.First, I liked the lead performances from Brad Pitt as Sgt. Collier (the commander of the tank crew) and Logan Lerman as Norman (a clerk typist who somehow got assigned to tank duty. Logan was not welcomed or respected by the crew. He didn't want to kill; he didn't really want to fight. He wanted to type. He still saw the Germans as people rather than enemies. I liked the portrayal of the bond that developed between Collier and Norman. Collier took him under his wing in a sense - protected him somewhat from the abuse of the crew and treated him decently, all the while preparing him for war. Norman gradually evolves and - sadly in some ways - by the end of the movie becomes a savage warrior like the others. I found myself kind of wanting Norman to stay more human; his gradual transformation was a little bit sad. The rest of the tank crew (played by actors like Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal) were pretty one dimensional.The best scenes of the movie are probably in the German apartment where Collier and Norman hook up with two German women - one of whom seemed very young and innocent - much like Norman, actually. There's a tension to those scenes. Norman takes her into a bedroom and we assume they have sex - but it didn't seem to be a savage rape. This was Norman. The two seemed genuinely to like each other and found something with each other in the midst of the insanity around them. The girl's death as a civilian casualty when the Americans are attacked seems to be the turning point for Norman.As I said, this is a pretty simple and straightforward movie - but it does have some good moments of reflection and humanity.

" Good enough... up until the last scene
",0.4404,-0.9433,2017-12-04 00:00:00,6,"A reasonably well-shot and definitely well-acted war movie, but with enough dumb plot holes and strange moments to leave you scratching your head. It's a great movie to watch in that in some ways it's the most realistic depiction of tank combat seen on film in ages - shells deflect when hitting armour at the wrong angle, there are certain weapons that a tank can just plain ignore, etc. However, there are also other choices made that cheapen the whole experience (I guarantee that Brad Pitt's Hitler Youth haircut would have gotten him lynched in WW2 for real) and the last scene is so unbelievably stupid that it beggars belief.I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say that it's easily the worst ""climax"" I've seen in a movie in years, maybe decades. Visually exciting but fundamentally and creatively ridiculous, it does a fine job of stripping the movie of any stage-setting and immersing it may have done previously. It's not an awful movie (some of the tank battle scenes are really exciting) but don't let your brain get involved."

" Why the Hate?
",-0.5719,0.9775,2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"I just watched ""Fury"" and decided to check on its score in IMDb and, boy, why did I ever do it... I don't understand the negative reviews... It's not realistic? The Tiger knocked out 3 Shermans and hit the Fury twice in the sides, before it went down. It was a very realistic ratio during WWII. The Tiger commander might have got overconfident, excited, overwhelmed, etc... Also, he ordered the Tiger forward, because he probably wanted to put a shell in the Fury's side. Why not?Why is the last scene so criticized? The SS soldiers took losses, because they were surprised and because they didn't expect to fight a fully armed American tank, which can pretty much maw down a lot of infantry with its machine guns and shells. The Panzerfaust weapons were not very effective against thicker armor, so you need to get very close to the tank's sides and hope it would penetrate the armor... Good luck in getting into position, while the tank is shooting at you with .50 caliber machine guns and high-explosive/phosphorus tank shells.I can go on and on about the realism, but I won't.This is an artistic depiction of WWII and it is done very well. Do you think American soldiers were not committing war crimes? They were. And many of these war crimes were not documented or revealed. It's war, people become savages and their humanity is stripped away.Last scene is a cliché? Read about the feats, accomplished by WWII Medal of Honor bearers... Compared to what some of these soldiers have done, mowing down 50 SS soldiers by a tank crew is nothing. So, educate yourself, people. And stop with the pretense you know everything about WWII."
" Out of touch
",0.0,-0.9957,2017-11-17 00:00:00,5,"This is my first review on IMDb and it is just to express my bewilderment regarding the rating of this movie.My issue with the film is that the tone of it feels off. Being filled with all the clichés already mentioned in many reviews, it would work great as a tongue-in-cheek B-movie type self-parody, but instead it attempts to take itself seriously, which leads to a very bizarre cinematic experience.The film is set in the last weeks of the war, when, in truth, German forces were outnumbered, outgunned, demoralized and surrendering to the Americans in droves, as they knew that their treatment by the Russians would have been cruel. At this point of the war, no one wanted to do anything especially stupid, like get killed, as both sides knew the inevitable outcome of the war. Expecting the audience to fall for this story of battle-weary ragtag American underdogs fighting superior numbers and equipment comes across as being incredibly out of touch, and it makes you question whether the production team really did any homework on this.The clichés would have been great entertainment if the film was more ""Expendables"" than the Normandy aftermath scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"". The historical inaccuracies and outright shortcuts, like experienced SS troops get their asses handed to them by one immobilized tank, cause spontaneous laughter, only to be followed up by Shia LaBeouf's best attempt at a thousand yard stare. It almost feels like the editing is at fault, but reflecting on what has happened earlier in the movie, you realize that these failures are not the result of an accident, but instead are in line with the director's vision.For me, the pinnacle of the failures of the movie comes in the last moments of the film, where I thought I heard the SS officer rally his troops by yelling something along the lines of ""Sie sind untermensch!"" I seriously hope I misheard that, but in any case I let out a deep sigh. Germans hardly considered Americans to be sub-human, fascist doctrine mostly painted Slavs as servile sub-humans, so this rallying cry epitomizes how out of touch the film crew really was.The film would have worked for me, and for many others I think, if the cast were set as German Wehrmacht soldiers. From this point of view, it would have been a breeze to capture the senselessness of fighting on the losing side, of being under equipped and demoralized. All the same characters could have died and the new recruit could have lived, but it would have been somewhat believable if they wore German uniforms (think of the ending of ""Letters from Iwo Jima"").This movie is not entertaining as every other scene simply takes you out of the story and you end up scratching your head in bewilderment.For a serious look at desperate warfare, go watch the Finnish movie ""Talvisota"", or the German ""Stalingrad"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". For B-movie type self-parody, go watch ""Commando"". Fury is not the best of both worlds. Some things just do not mix.5/10."
" Good performance wasted on bad story
",-0.5859,-0.4955,2017-09-18 00:00:00,5,"This is the story of a battle hardened crew making their way across Germany during WW II in a Sherman tank. Although not many movies made that I can compare, it's unique in the sense that most of it takes place from the perspective of the tank crew. The visuals include a lot of unnecessary gore that added little of nothing to the movie. The story was lacking despite the fine performances of the actors and it seemed to drag on at times with content that really didn't add anything. There were a couple of scenes that even seemed it didn't quite fit the story-line.Enough to the story to get me through it but unlikely I would see it again.

It shows violence without qualms, and succeeds in creating a memorable rendering for the viewer, well helped by several tense action scene and a total immersion, comforting the viewer that it all seems real.But in fact it contrasts with the historic reality and all the credibility of the events bound to it, which are indeed quite forgotten for the sake of the tense and bad-ass looking scenes. Germans' tanks and their anti-tank artillery are less accurate and effective than they really were, allowing American soldiers and tanks to take the advantage in situations where they might have not, situations they probably wouldn't have engaged that way in the first place in reality, knowing both their own strength and weakness and those of German units, and preferring not taking such useless risks, especially at that time near the end of the war. So the exceptional is standardized, and a handful of Americans hold a suicidal position against a regiment of hundreds of Nazis, butchering many of them. It could have been greater if the Germans looked less like a herd of wildebeest willing to rush in number and more like soldiers willing to defeat or simply survive their enemy to fight at least another day. In fact the context of this whole last stand lacks credibility, why the hell these Americans would sacrifice their life to hold a position against all odds, whereas Germany is collapsing, invaded from everywhere by Allies and Soviets, and this German armed group is not in position to change a damn thing about it, in fact such a German force would have most likely entrenched itself on a defensive position to ambush the enemy at that time of the war, rather than the opposite.Anyway the film is made of good quality, with a good immersion, tense and convincing actors who compensate the more artificial and less credible stakes of the scenario, to give you a quite memorable viewing."

I didn't like Brad Pitt's ""typical"", clean- shaven, muscular, mean army guy thing that he had going on. Also the fact that Logan Lerman's character was the other ""typical"" character that had no idea what was going on was kind of ridiculous. The pain and fear that Logan Lerman's character faced is not unusual, but the fact that he was forcibly placed onto a tank was kind of weird. From my experience, it seems that those who work in tanks have some kind of special training. Why would they put someone like that in a tank? It doesn't seem very realistic. Jon Bernthal's character was also barbaric and seemed to be a bit exaggerated. Of course, it's possible that all of this may have actually happened. After all, anything's possible. However, the clothes and hairstyle that the girl had were incredibly unrealistic. That's not what girls of the 40s looked like. The fact that they just walked into the next room and had sex but tried to make it seem romantic was really weird. The movie itself gave almost no indication that the characters were suffering. Jon Bernthal's character showed signs of breaking but it kind of seemed like his character was already like that. It seems like they took a couple of facts that they knew happened and tried to revolve everything around those things, without doing any other research..."

There was ONE tank battle that was extremely underwhelming full of stupid moans and groans by the ""TANK CREW"" who are painfully stereotypical. There's the hick, the Mexican (???), the beta-male new guy Percy Jackson, Shia LaBarf trying to be southern, and a total rip off of Lt. Aldo Raine from Inglorious Basterds played by the one and only Brad Pitt whose haircut on the movie poster drew in so many viewers. I'm sure there was a small surge of patrons at barbers and salons who wanted ""the fury"" haircut. All I wanted after that movie was that hour and a half of my life back. From the beginning, the audience is presented with Brad's character who we know has had a troubled past and has suffered devastating losses in the war based on his facial expressions and grease covered hands and nose... spoiler... nobody really gives a f***. All of the asides and diatribes of the characters are so so so bad that they actually made me wish the Germans had won the war. The writing, acting and editing are sub par to say the least. Honestly, you should just watch it for a serious laugh because it is truly hilarious to think that the people who made this movie quite possibly thought that they made a film that would undoubtedly touch the hearts of its viewers and show the grimness and despair of a WWII tank crew... I laughed just typing that. No joke, one of the death scenes of one of the characters is priceless - it made me spit my drink out of laughter and joy."
" One Of The Best War Movies In The Past 20 Years

Hitler has mobilized every German he could get his hands on (old men, women, children) to try to stop the American advance. At the front lines is a Sherman tank crew headed by a tough Sergeant played by Brad Pitt. Short one crewman who was killed in action, Pitt receives a completely green, teenaged soldier (played by Logan Lerman) who specializes in typing and never had one minute of training in a tank.Knowing that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, Pitt forces Lerman to grow up much faster than the kid is able to. With a huge push deeper into enemy territory coming up fast, Pitt's crew must work together as one, cohesive unit if they are to have even a small chance of staying alive.My most memorable, movie moment on ""Fury"" is the scene when Pitt's platoon of tanks line up side by side and fire at a treeline ahead of them where German soldiers have taken a defensive position. With all guns firing (main cannons, .50 Browning heavy machine-guns, .30 machine-guns) the Germans are slaughtered within seconds, with many bodies blown to pieces.The outer shell of ""Fury"" is a vicious, gruesome tale of WW II combat. Within this shell is the story of Pitt, a veteran warrior who is near his breaking point, and is further burdened with a boy he must teach to be a hardened soldier; and in doing so, risks further dehumanizing himself as well as the boy.""Fury"" is one of the best war movies made in the last 20 years; and had it not been for the slight — I'm being kind here — unbelievable nature of the final battle, ""Fury"" would have been destined to become a classic.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

Why? It is unrealistic...ehm, yes EVERYTHING in this movie is unrealistic. Why is this the worst movie ever: It portrays American soldiers as barbarians. This movie is an insult for all those veterans. They like to kill the POW's. They encourage fellow soldiers to be sadistic. - The German soldiers have to fire zillion bullets to kill one American, while they are killed by the hundreds. The best soldiers Germany had, the SS, they can't knock out one tank while they have 300 men. They keep running towards the tank like sheep. VERY UNREALISTIC. In reality, this would have been 5 minute work for 300 Germans. When Brad Pitt and his new tank crewmember, bust into a house. They find a German woman with her lovely young cousin (ahum....as always). They are very scared...the might get raped. But within 5 minutes, this cousin decides to have voluntary sex with the crew member of Brad Pitt in the room behind them. Can you imagine? That you and your daughter have two uninvited, let's say, German soldiers in your house and your daughter wants to have immediately sex with one of them, while at first she was very scared that she might get raped. CRAZY. This is the best love story I have ever seen in my life, epic! The new young crew member of Brad Pitt, is at first a shy religious cleric and changes within two days in a murdering machine. When the (tracer) bullets were flying around, I thought am I watching here some sci-fi movie? It looked like they were using laser-guns. Can't be...it is 1944. And the scene with the Tiger tank. The best tank of WW2. The American Sherman, in real life, with his 75 mm gun would not penetrate the Tiger frontally at ANY range. And what do the Germans? they decide to drive towards the Americans so the Americans have to chance to hit the Tiger in the back.....again, the Germans are dumb, Brad Pitt is smart. The American soldiers are portrayed as rude and have no respect for the ones higher in command. They are sadistic to Germans and to their own soldiers. They act like a bunch of undisciplined soldiers.When the Germans are targeting with a lot of bullets the American tanks, Brad Pitt doesn't gonna sit inside the tank. But is giving orders on top of the tank. Of course, not a single bullet will hit him. Why should he.....???????? And when three bullets hit Brad Pitt, does he die like a normal person instantly or has at least some excruciating pain. No of course not, he can sit down and have a normal conversation. And of course the end of the movie...really...that was so unrealistic. So conclusion: I think that even Rambo is a better movie and more realistic ;)"

In fact, I knew nothing about Logan until I happened upon ""Indignation"" (quite by accident, actually).""Fury"" is powerful, but gut-wrenching. The horrors of war and the losses that occur in war are portrayed with gravity. The end is not what I was expecting, giving it all the more merit. Brad Pitt is superb in a role I might never have expected for him. ""Fury"" has guts. It is coarse, delivering a strong and at times a disturbing reality of what we humans do to one another in such settings. ""Fury"" is not for the weak of heart.After reading some of the reviews posted here, I may be on the short straw. But, I really like this movie because of its intensity. I may watch it again to see what I might have missed the first time.I must say once again that Logan Lerman is powerful as ""Norman"". I suspect his character reached me because I was only 18 one month before joining USAF (that was 1962). I was not in combat, but in overseas remote site Intel. I came of age in the Air Force. Lerman's character ""Norman"" speaks to me. Those days of youthful, moral righteousness and steadfast honesty are a dim memory. Like ""Norman"", I hardened."
" A compelling achievement
",0.2263,-0.9787,2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"It is 1944. US forces are taking Germany back from the Nazis. FURY is the name of one of their tanks, and its crew are Brad Pitt, Shia LaBoeuf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal.A screen commanding film, Fury is an achievement for Director David Ayer. He rises to the occasion summoning strong performances and crafting brutally vivid images and rousing fight scenes.The story is told largely from the point of view of a recent draftee, who wants nothing to do with war. He is assigned to Pitt's crew and there is a good scene where Pitt attempts to 'christen' him by handing him a pistol and bullying him into shooting captured Nazi, but the kid is too squeamish to do so. Despite being in some great movies, Brad Pitt hasn't done much for me in the last ten years. Since Inglorious Basterds, he has become a little monotonous. In fury he succeeds in channelling a convincing real beast which he hides behind his patriarchal composure.There is an intriguingly lengthy scene where he and his tank crew have breakfast in the home of two German women (complete strangers) , in a half abandoned town. It's not much of a breakfast but it becomes clear that the meal is less important than merely being in a home in the company of women (something that soldiers don't get the luxury of). Kicking off the last act there is a memorable one on one tank fight between our guys and a German Tiger tank. In the middle of an open field, they fight like man o' war ships in a bay, each relying on strategy more than fire power to bring the other one down. The climax is a suicidal stand off between our guys and a German platoon. Bullets and shells go flying amidst the surrealist lighting of explosions and flames. The ending we get is an inevitable one, but it is perfectly appropriate for the kind of war movie that Fury wants to be."

The former were, are, and always will be cowardly losers, but can be somewhat excused because they have never actually had to live in reality of any sort. The latter share some of those loser traits, but should know better. If history serves me correctly, we expunged them from our shores (not once, but twice), then showed up to help bail them out in their own back yard (gee...not once, but twice). If you twerps want to see Brits in wartime action, make your own damn movies (you haven't done a good one in 45 years or so).Having gotten that out of the way, I just finished watching Fury for the third time, and was as amazed as the first two times. There have been precious few films that have truly showed the utter brutality that is war, none as frankly as this one. No flag-waving, no nationalism beyond hatred of the Nazis, and NO reset button if you screw up. All in all, a stellar telling of the lives of tank crews (without a transformer or comic book superhero in sight)."

The Germans walked right into an entrenched American force who mowed them down left and right with very little loss of American life. Stuff like this happens in war. Late in the war there would not have been ""crack"" German forces left to defend Germany. All these complaints about how badly the Germans fought are not that unrealistic.

",-0.0258,-0.9007,2017-05-11 00:00:00,1,"The tank was good.....that and the Panzer were the most endearing features of this naive effort.From the beginning, I disliked, actually disliked, the main characters. They had no redeeming features, in particular Brad Pitt's character. The young recruit was, I fear, completely forgettable. I spent most of the film hoping they would all come to a gory end.The final scene, much commented upon before, was a travesty of stupidity, and continued the contention,well-established in so many post-war films, that German soldiers were useless. These ones certainly were, but then they did not write the moronic script, did they? It has all been said before, but crack SS troops, even at the end of the war, would not be as stupid as to attack a stricken tank from the front; although it has to be said that the final shot shows German bodies splayed out front, sides and back, so perhaps Fury had deployed some hidden weaponry, which we were not to know about.The denouement reminded me of that other great leap of the imagination, the final scene of ""Gauntlet"", hardly Clint Eastwood's finest hour, in which hundreds of Policeman, armed to the teeth, stand either side of a flimsy bus and pour torrents of bullets into it. Apparently, film bullets do not ever miss their target, nor indeed penetrate through a glass windowed bus to emerge the other side.That was tosh, and so was this.With different lead actors, a different script, better direction and just a little proper research and common-sense, this could have been a good film; but even then I doubt it."

",0.7264,0.8912,2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"Not a fan of war movies and battlefield scenes I had no expectation that I would enjoy this flick. And enjoy is not the right word because it is very long and certainly difficult to deal with. But there are two reasons I believe the movie is to be praised. First the hardened leader of the tank squad, WarDaddy played by Brad Pitt, reveals deep down a sympathy and a compassion for a young soldier way out of his element, an office soldier who somehow becomes a victim of army procedures and was sent to fight in a dangerous showdown with SS troops desperate to save the Heimat from the Americans in the last days of the war somewhere in western or central Germany. Pitt is tough, hard on his comrades and even harder on the Krauts he encounters. But he also, my second point, is able to be somewhat sympathetic even to the German civilians he encounters, whether they were or were not Nazi believers. The scene in the German home with the two women and the battle scared veteran Americans, plus the coming of age there of Norman the young soldier mentioned above, is very movingly done. Pitt's character is complex: a mixture of needed brutality covering perhaps a sensitivity as genuine as Norman's. You don't see this very often in these movies and I applaud those responsible for seeing past the obvious. I am not sure whether Norman's life is spared by accident or by a German soldier's sudden decision to be merciful; if the latter is meant then even a German soldier can have compassion. This did not occur often -- especially not on the Eastern Front -- but it did occur. Germans are after all not that different from us, as much as we should like to think and as much as we are justified in being skeptical."

This is one of the best war films from the last couple of years only competing with: inglorious basterds, American sniper and the hurt locker for the top spot. this is unfortunately because of the drought of war films but with The wall starring john Cena and Aaron Taylor Johnson coming up the future of war films is looking up.Brad Pitt and Jon Bernthal have worked together before this in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds gaining some good war film experience. Micheal Pena and director David Ayer both worked together on End of Watch. I'm also sure Shia la Beouf gained a bit of war film experience from transformers.From the very start of the film Logan Lerman puts up a great performance as Norman and does very well to fit in with the all star cast. The film has some incredible shots showing the good the bad and horrific bits of the war. The tension is great throughout the film but sometimes stops because of long drawn out scenes.Altogether fury is a great war time drama/action film with an all star cast the only bad things in it are a couple of clichés some unnecessarily long drawn out scenes and the film being a little bit too long."
" Exciting if flawed Second World War tank action
",-0.1779,-0.9917,2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier is the commander of a US Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury'; he and his crew have been in the thick of it in North Africa, Normandy and are now in Germany in the dying days of the war. Private Norman Ellison has only been in the army for eight weeks and is trained as an office typist until for some reason he is assigned to Collier's crew to replace a dead member he is definitely not ready for the terrors of war. He is certainly the outsider in the crew. As they progress through various actions he sees is baptism of fire and becomes a hardened fighter. Eventually collier is ordered to take five tanks to defend a vital crossroads; four are destroyed leaving 'Fury to defend the location then a battalion of SS turn up and one hell of a firefight ensues.If you are looking for a war film with lots of brutal action then this is likely to be the film for you; people are decapitated; burn and are blown up. There is also the feeling that secondary characters could die at any time and as the end approaches it feels as if anybody could die. There is a problem with the characters unfortunately; early on we see Collier forcing Ellison to shoot a German prisoner and the rest of the 'hardened crew' are even less likable I almost found myself cheering for the German Tiger tank that was picking off the 'good guys'. The action scenes were intense and nicely captured some of the confusion of battle even if, as others have noted, the tracer fire looked like lasers in a sci-fi movie. The ending definitely requires one to suspend ones disbelief as hundreds of Germans take enormous casualties before they make the slightest headway against this single tank even though they have anti-tank weapons. The cast lead by Brad Pitt, in the role of Collier, does a solid job making us believe in the characters even if some of those characters are pretty hard to like. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of war films; just don't expect it to be too believable."
" Unbelievable, farcical and boring

I was sadly mistaken. This is just another one of those WWII films where a handful of heroic US soldiers take on and wipe out whole battalions of elite German troops in a totally unconvincing and ridiculous way. The action scenes are just not believable. Using a Sherman tank, not the best choice as they were known as a 'Ronsons' after the lighter, because they caught fire very easily, this sort of 'A' team' takes on hundreds of elite German troops. Their machine guns seem to have unlimited amounts of ammunition and the German troops having been surprised by the tank continue to run around like headless chickens for ages allowing themselves to be mown down by the score. There were many impossibilities and inaccuracies in the action scenes, but by golly it must have made the American audiences back home in the US puff out their chests and feel great! This film adds nothing to understanding WWII and it's horrors and I just don't understand why it was made at all other than to make shareholders a profit. Basically this sort of garbage should never have made it to the big screen or small screen for that matter, it should have been quietly left to rot in some dark corner or better still put on a spacecraft and blasted off into outer space where a million years from now some unfortunate alien might stumble upon it!"

Proof if ever you needed one that the world is full of idiots.I need to give special mention to the final battle scene, because it really is a piece of work. Inexplicably, the murderous tank crew of this film decide to protect their knackered tank in the middle of a road where 2-300 elite SS soldiers are approaching (presumably so they can get off from more killing).The young lad that spots them approaching walks about 50 metres from the tank and runs back. It then takes the SS about 15 minutes to walk 150 metres so that the writer of this film can try and make the audience feel emotion for the brave soldiers for deciding to stay and fight, because they are so dumb.For the next 15 minutes, laughably, the SS soldiers choose to criss-cross back and forth and then do that several times over in front of the tanks main weapons until their number is depleted to a handful. They literally run up to the front of the tank to get mowed down and this is interspersed with the crew inside having a rather relaxed time telling each other what they are doing. Somehow darkness totally descends in this short space of time for a cynical attempt to add dramatic effect. This is when these elite SS soldiers get out a few of their bazookas and fire at the tank from 5 metres. And MISS. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Next Brambo Pitt gets shot 3 times and falls back into the tank to have a chat with his comrades. Now I can't be ar*ed to describe any more as I'm getting angry remembering how stupid it all is.If you want to watch this film: don't. Go on YouTube and just watch the final battle scene. It will either make you angry or make you burst out laughing. Which would be worth it."

" Lack of a real reaction and comradery in a pivotal moment
",-0.3182,-0.9963,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,SPOILER ALERT! The movie overall is pretty well done but the lack of sympathy between the characters and for people in general is unrealistic. Whether or not these men hate the Germans would make no difference during Emma's death scene. The fact that these men just shared a meal and obviously this young teenager just had a moment with this girl would cause a totally different reaction than what was seen in the film. OK so if this kid was still getting locked up and not killing Germans I could understand the men treating him with contempt but they've watched him kill and fight along side them so if he wants to run over and remove bricks from a dead women he just slept with they would have never treated him that way. I understand they are battle hardened vets who have seen the horrors of war but they have American values instilled in them and they would have never through him to the ground and acted as if it was an o well type of moment. This was a very tragic death and obviously these 2 women treated them fairly well especially the young man and brad Pitt and to act the way they did was unreal. Again I understand they've been through hell and back over and over again but the reaction depicted made me write this review because it honestly just bugs me to make them act this way. Maybe I'm overreacting but it just felt odd and I think that's even why they did a follow up scene with an apology to the young kid because if they didn't you'd feel no sympathy for these men because they have no sympathy for anyone not even each other. As a man coming from a family of veterans they have told me many stories and there are times to be tough and show little remorse but the one thing that holds men close together and makes them want to fight is the understanding of each other emotions and noticing moments when u show empathy for a tragedy. They've told me you can't do it all the time or else you'd be withering in sadness the whole war but a moment such as that would make the men pull the kid up not knock him to the ground because that's only going to effect his fighting. Sorry for the overreaction but just had to get that off my chest.

As such, a new approach can be hard to create.The film starts well, unlike most modern WWII films it focuses on an experienced tank crew headed by none other but the charismatic Brad Pitt. Against all odds this tank team seems to have survived multiple battles and the films begins showing a severely religious and naive new recruit commanded to join the tight-knit team near the end of the war. It becomes immediately clear that part of the film will evolve around the changing psyche of this new idealistic, utopian-minded recruit.The film is explicitly gritty, showing the true horror of war. One particular memorable, albeit brief, scene shows a body being run over by a tank. Another shows bulldozers clearing away a small mountain of dead German soldiers. It seems to denounce the reality of war as any good war film will do. Yet, despite this fantastic start the film made, it soon descends in terms of script, characters and story-line. The transition of new recruit ""Norman"" is so fast as to be unbelievable. Meanwhile an against-the-odds action-focused scene at the end, shows the Nazi enemy to be inept rather than the feared experienced enemy they actually were. In the end, the film seems to glorify violence that it earlier seemed to condemn.The film is easy-watching, at times shocking and well produced but in the end is ultimately forgettable. If you are just looking for a general war film to fill the time, this film will fit the bill."

Do you really park up and ruminate life next to a burning tank full of ammunition? Do you really patrol bunched up next to an ambush threat. The war is nearly over. The Germans had realized they'd lost months ago. Would a company of soldiers fight to the last man knowing their support MG and AT guns were taken out? Did GI's really chatter away in 21st century slang? Even the hem line and thigh split in the dress of the lass hiding under the bed is unrealistic.Two stars for good action scenes and an insight into how a tank crew operates..

Don't get me wrong its not a masterpiece like saving private Ryan. but works as great entertainment with a little extra...Brad who pretty much dominate the film does a good role. Despite his age the man is in great shape, and deliver a good performance. That sad thing is that he is almost a parody of himself and reminds me a lot about Aldo from inglorious bastards. Ofcorce not close to the same quality. But that is not expected either. But anyway see this film, its not the best but works so good anyway. I like how the film follows a dark, hardcore plot line. Mud, blood, bullets anything a 16 year old want to see with his friends on a Friday after a boring week at school. I had a good time despite week plot and not the greatest dialogue. I can see that more grown up and intelligence people don't find this very fascinating. But if you ask me (our some of my friends) its was great and delivered 100% Sorry for bad English I'm from Norway."
" How to ruin a war movie within the final 20 minutes.
",-0.8271,-0.5039,2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Fury actually begins quite good. It isn't uncommon for war movies to reduce ""realism"". So it is rather the standard that enemy forces attack just in the right size, so that the heroes can take care of them. And it can even be helpful for the audience, to focus on specific aspects.Plus: We wouldn't want enemy PAKs and Panzerfäuste to attack organized, all at once from different sides, wouldn't we? I might even accept the shallow characters, trying to represent the result of their harsh experiences. I could even accept the fictional scenario that a Tiger would engage a battle all on its own, so that ""Fury"" could prove its point of Americans fighting a technically superior opponent. But the final battle ... I don't know, I think that's how you insult the intelligence of your customers."
