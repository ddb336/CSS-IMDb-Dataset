" Nice comedy...
",0.4215,0.9941,2021-02-24 00:00:00,6,"""That Awkward Moment"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch three best friends being single at the same period after a long time, and they arrange to remain single no matter what. As time goes by they face some problems in order ot stick on their common promise.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it was interesting and very funny in some moments. The direction which was made by Tom Gormican who is also the writer, it was nice and I believe that he did a good job on combining three well-known actors and create something good. The interpretations of Zac Efron who played as Jason, Michael B. Jordan who played as Mikey and Miles Teller who played as Daniel, they were very good and the combination of the, it was very good. Finally, I have to say that ""That Awkward Moment"" is an interesting, funny movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure you will have a great time watching it."
" Guilty Pleasure Rom Com
",0.2263,0.94,2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie and I don't care that it has all the cliches of your typical rom com. All the leads and costars (first thing I saw Mackenzie Davis in) are great and it was pretty much before they all blew up. Daniel and Chelsea have my favorite storyline in this film. If you love rom coms, this is the film for you."
" It's all been done before and better
",0.4404,0.9326,2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,"That Awkward Moment is another in a long line of cliche-filled romantic comedies that provides nothing that is original or interesting to the genre. In this one we are introduced to three douchey guys who make a pact to stay single, which naturally means they will all find romance a matter of five minutes later. There is some humor in the way these guys interact, which kind of saved the movie for me. I liked the banter between Michael B. Jordan, Zac Efron, and Miles Teller even if it reinforced the feeling that these guys were complete frat boys at heart. I guess if I'm going to sit through a rom-com with nothing new to say, then I'm glad there were a few moments of levity that worked for me. The relationships they develop aren't terrible, even if every single moment leading up to those romances is completely predictable.Because there are 3 different lead actors in That Awkward Moment, they have 3 different stories to tell. It seemed like the Zac Efron romance got the most screen-time, and that meant it was the easiest to get invested in. Miles Teller gets a little less time to work out his romantic feelings, but when it's a story as rote as this one, it doesn't take much. Michael B. Jordan has the most nuanced romantic arc because he's dealing with an ex, but he gets the least screen-time to work it out, which is a shame. But there's only so many minutes of movie to go around, so I suppose they needed to cut somewhere. I kind of miss the days when a film would just focus on one romantic storyline so they'd actually have time to work through all the details. That Awkward Moment is not a movie I would recommend to others, but it was not painful to watch either."
" It has its moments...
",0.0,0.9459,2020-01-14 00:00:00,4,"Let me say how much I love Miles Teller and truth be told may be the only reason I watched this in the first place. He blows me away ever since ""The Spectacular Now"". So in this, he's just got the best chemistry with his friend / love interest. They are adorable. They need more air time in this flick.Now Zac and Imogen Poots doesn't work for me. It's odd and they are clearly the primary focus of the movie, so otherwise I may have enjoyed this more. Zac is too immature as usual, but that's sort of expected.I think this movie wanted and tried to be more than a juvenile comedy and just misses the mark."
" Alright
",0.25,0.9554,2019-11-30 00:00:00,5,"Comedy movies for the twenties are all sort of the same. It's cool to see ones that tell a different story. But this is ordinary stuff. Cool college kids become adults and adjust to life. It's fun to watch but is not going to win any awards.Zac Efron and Miles Teller do good together. It's a lot of the same stuff, sex relationships etc. work, adjusting to being adults.It was good. I really liked it and could watch it again.5 stars"
" And as it sound
",0.0,-0.471,2019-09-15 00:00:00,5,Well I love those actors but this movie quality is not good or funny
" Haters gonna hate
",-0.7845,-0.7498,2019-08-30 00:00:00,8,I don't know why everyone's being so negative about this film it's actually very well done. The chemistry of the bromance is amazing and believable story line. Down to earth dialogue and I've lived almost all of these moments so the reality of this movie hits home. Avoid all the negative comments and view it as a bromantic rom com and you'll laugh your ass off
" HOPELESS PIECE OF WORK
",-0.4588,0.25,2019-08-09 00:00:00,1,Where do they find these hopeless writers/directors. A truly bad script and direction. Is Zac Efron crazy for accepting something like this? If Zac wants a career he needs to avoid doing these teenage style movies. At least he was great in the Ted Bundy one.
" That Awkward Moment
",-0.1531,0.7783,2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,9/10 - surprisingly hilarious and worthy of an annual rewatch
" Simple and Easy watching
",0.4404,0.5423,2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Good movie, simple, realistic, except the awesome apartments but by hey what can I say I'm a dude"
" How to not date
",0.0,0.9229,2019-01-14 00:00:00,4,"To start off: this film is aimed at 18-25 year olds. Any other age group will most likely find it krass and very immature.It follows the story of three homies/bros in NYC, who have decided to stay single out of solidarity for one another, all the while aiming to add girls to their ""rooster"" (a growing list of girls whom they sleep with in turn).
Will they be able to manage? or will one of them start to develop feelings, and lose the challenge? Does anyone really care?It ends up being very run of the mill and unoriginal. The toilet humor offered a couple laughs (but more the ""Why did i even laugh at that"" type of laugh), but the leads come across as smug, unrealistic and full of themselves. Michael B.Jordan is the only character worth sympathizing with, as he seems to be the type of person you would account in real life.The rest are Hollywood glossed over and idealized.
Dont use it as dating advice!"
" That Awkward Moment (2014)
",-0.1531,-0.7195,2018-12-09 00:00:00,6,"Not the best comedy, but the cast of the film makes it alive.But the bad timing(execution) and the script makes it hard to watch.Anyway not that bad.Feel good comedy for anyone who likes awkward loves stories. : pOverall - 3/5"
" Thumbs Up!
",0.0,0.9877,2018-12-05 00:00:00,9,"I watched it today, and I usually am not in the mood for a Comedy, but this was a great mix with Drama and Romance. It was hilarious! And I love how the movie focused on the feelings from both sides. I'd definitely recommend this movie!"
" love
",0.6369,0.9753,2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this romantic comedy because it examines the different stages that build up to the fork in the road. The five year plan is a very good way of looking at it but even with that plan in hand you still get to a point where you both say where is this going and will our five year plan work out for the two of us. This is more a satire of all relationships and how each couple looks at the five year plan differently or how each couple looks at the fork in the road of where do we go from here differently. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are surprisingly good also. This was a great ensemble cast because no one out-shined and no one decided to try and be a hack and ham it up. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" amazing
",0.5859,0.3442,2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"I've never laughed so much watching a movie, i defintly loved it."
" A stupid comedy
",-0.2263,-0.9633,2018-09-30 00:00:00,3,"A very stupid movie that doesn't leave nothing at the end. The dialogues are full of bad words and superficial discussions, nothing new to show, Zac Efron is quite ugly and insignificant here and the same is for the other actors. 
Film script poor and embarassing. Really a bad movie."
" It's an okay movie
",0.2263,0.8535,2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Funny movie with good actors. The script was a bit cheesy, just like a lot of movies of the same genre. I didn't necessarily like the way Michael's storyline ended, they could've done a lot more with that. Also feel like the endings of the other two storylines were kind of predictable. The acting really saved this movie. Not the worst movie I've seen, but sadly it's also not one of my favorites."
" Underrated!
",0.0,0.9558,2018-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie! I love watching Efron, Teller and Jordan cutting their acting teeth along with Imogen Poots. New York is a great co-star and the soundtrack is good as well. I watch this at least once a year!"
" So where is this going?
",0.0,0.5927,2018-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Three guys vow to stay single. Jason (Zac Efron) is a NYC book cover designer who plays the field. He doesn't realize he is dating a woman until after they break up with him. Daniel (Miles Teller) works with Jason and has a friends with benefits relationship with Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). Guess how that works out...hint it's a chick flick. Mike (Michael B. Jordan) is a doctor whose wife (Jessica Lucas) wants a divorce and is cheating on him with a lawyer. Jason meets Ellie (Imogen Poots) who is everything he wants in a woman as this throws a wrench into the ""everybody stay single and play the field like we're in college"" vow.This is a chick flick poorly disguised as a guy's film. We know it is a chick flick because it is overrated due to Zac Efron being in it. It tosses some crude humor at us and some better barbs about relationships, but frankly it is the same old Hollywood shtick that brings nothing new to the table. Having said that, the actors did a fine job in their roles made unconvincing by a trite script.Will do as a chick flick rental, although I thought ""The Other Woman"" was a funnier chick flick.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity. Efron nearly nude"
" Writer Director sinking ship
",0.0,-0.4689,2018-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Another in a long line of closed circle movies that seem to get green lit and funded without a good script to make the effort and expense worth it.
The scary part of this unlikable film is that the guy who wrote this, and conned all these people into working on it might actually either believe this is how normal people act, or moves in a circle where these thoroughly unlikable people actually exist.
The mind boggles, as it's a well put together and acted horribly scripted piece of unpleasantness, with it's ugly unapologetic misogyny, that the talented female cast go along with. The end credit outtakes don't paint the guys in a good light either, carrying on like their sexist charmless characters do for the duration of the movie, but maybe that's just the method acting they needed to do to stay in these thoroughly unlikable skins."
" Not a big deal, but I laughed, and grieved.
",0.0,0.0644,2017-10-19 00:00:00,7,"That Awkward moment, when the movie is all about dirty jokes and 3 actors fitting in with each other perfectly, but then turns into a real sad drama in no time, and things go complicated, but ultimately, everything is solved. I adored this movie.7/10"
" Underrated Film
",0.0,0.6294,2017-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. There are jokes and scenes in this that killed me. Great cast, acting, chemistry, score and production. I'd rate it a 7.5If you don't like the humor/style, you will know in a few minutes so worth checking out this underrated movie. The score fits beautifully with the film builds--a post-rock industrial feel but more present, telescoping the emotion with the flow of the film."
" Not A Romantic Comedy...
",-0.3089,0.9713,2017-08-22 00:00:00,6,"I give this movie a six, because it still made me laugh, especially in the first half of the film, but to me this movie is not a romantic comedy at all, it's closer to a drama. It seems typical of the type of ""romantic"" movies being produced today, they're all just reminiscent of the fact that most young people now a days have no concept of what love is and are all harboring some form or another of commitment issues, though this movie really highlighted that fact within the dating culture of men, though in reality it seems to be across the board. That being said, I am sure that many people would get a kick out of this film, as I mentioned it does have it's funny aspects, particularly in the beginning, but something about this class of film just annoys me. Perhaps it's the fact that the characters are all in their twenties and yet they all have their careers so neatly in order but their love life is so incredibly dysfunctional... It seems to hint at one aspect of life that many people can relate to these days whilst simply glossing over the rest. Perhaps I am thinking too much into it, but unless a ""romantic comedy"" either has me in fits of laughter or at least leaves me with that feel good reaction, it's not likely to rank very highly in my books."
" Loved it!
",0.636,0.992,2017-05-31 00:00:00,8,"I've probably seen this movie over twenty times already, and every time I love it even more. It's so refreshing that it's not your typical romantic comedy with a pretty girl and a handsome guy who fall in love. The characters are so much more relatable and the humour and jokes are similar to the ones I find in my own group of friends. They chose the perfect actors for the characters and you can see they actually enjoyed filming it. My favorite part might be the bloopers after the credits; they crack me up every time. I would totally recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good laugh and doesn't want to watch something too serious."
