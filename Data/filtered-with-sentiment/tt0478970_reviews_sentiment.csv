" I want the Edgar Wright cut!
",-0.2714,0.9117,2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Ant-Man was a lot funner than I expected it to be, but I would have loved to see what Edgar Wright of Shaun of the Dead fame would've done with this before he left as director.Paul Rudd has got to be the most affable/likeable actor on the planet and he's pretty damn good at balancing the humor, drama and action as Scott/Ant-Man. But Evangeline Lilly was my fave -- her snarkiness was a welcome change from her tear-filled stint on Lost (she only cried for five seconds in this).And Michael Douglas! I can't remember the last movie I saw him in. He's the origin story, the family dynamic, and the fulcrum of the team. Corey Stoll was very bland as the villain with little sense of danger.And last but not least is Michael Peña as Luis leading the robber-three stooges. The lip-synching story rap was fantastic.This was a perfect setup for Ant-Man's over-sized role in Civil War."

" another good superhero
",0.4404,0.9852,2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Besides Batman, Ironman, Superman and many others, this one is unique superhero character for which I have not heard before. It has all the new stuff I expected to see. High presence of technology, emotions, different vehicles, people, devices, ideas. Best is the topic, being able to change size of something using physics. Then best are the stunts, similar to video game or dream or some animals' abilities, it's fun to watch different moves, positions, abilities. Then few smaller funny things especially in form of talk. For me the best part was that tank and train near the end. So funny, unbelievable, odd, cool. Bit faster and less emotional than Spiderman, but considering that idea is totally new and not copied from any similar movies, does not deserve any less rating. Better end than beginning. The travel into subatomic level graphics are better than some of the best movies like Interstellar (2014)."

" Ant-Man (2015, Peyton Reed) Rudd shines as another under the radar Marvel hero makes it to the big screen
",0.7506,0.9952,2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Ant-Man (2015, Peyton Reed)
Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" before it when ""Ant-Man"" was first announced I raised my eyebrow quizzically and wondered if these guys were serious. ""Guardians"" far surpassed all expectations. ""Ant-Man"" while being quite good falls into the margin of only adequate as far as the Marvel universe goes. Up until the very end this was a completely stand-alone entry into the Marvel universe and as such felt a bit misplaced although it appears that Ant-Man will make a reappearance at least in the next Captain America film if not more. For the most part though this film really was all on its own and also featured a new hero into the Marvel film lexicon and as such we get treated to another origin story. These origin stories while vital to introducing new and especially lesser known characters tend to lead toward a duller action film because we have to spend so much time introducing the characters and understanding their back story and such. The action we've come to expect out of these films really took a back seat to character development and also as we are dealing with Ant-Man the action scenes were not on par with some of the big set pieces in other Avengers films. One of the major successes here is the casting of Paul Rudd who like many of the casting choices for these Marvel films really seems to completely embody his character. Ant-Man's real life persona is that of Scott Lang who is an adept burglar with a heart of gold who ends up being jailed. When we come across him he is just getting released from prison and in attempt to maintain contact with his daughter he is trying his best to follow the straight and narrow. The path to righteousness is a harder one than he anticipated and in attempting one last score he ends up getting caught and jailed once more but this time he has attracted the notice of Dr. Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, who developed the incredible shrinking suit and in realizing the destructive potential hid it away from the world until now. Pym's former student cum nemesis Darren Cross is close to developing the shrinking technology and Pym has deemed now the time to stop him and to that end he enlists Scott Lang to become the new Ant-Man. Rudd who seems like an odd choice for a super hero does a great job of channeling Lang's sad sack loser of a man into a humorous, thoughtful portrayal as well as shedding some pounds and adding muscle much in the way Chris Pratt did to portray Starlord in Guardians. Evangeline Lilly comes along as Pym's daughter and initially she resents the inclusion of Scott Lang on this mission as she sees herself as the clear choice to don the suit. This is a good, fun, entertaining film and they do their best with the action sequences they do have but 'Ant-Man' overall lacks some of the large scale excitement of most of the other Marvel films.

" I actually thoroughly enjoyed 'Ant-Man'
",0.5563,0.9836,2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Much better than anticipated, I actually thoroughly enjoyed 'Ant-Man'. The concept is silly, but I felt it made it work very well.It starts off as more Paul Rudd-esque than Marvel-esque, especially with the comedy. I wasn't expecting much from it at that point, not that it was necessarily bad or anything but it wasn't what I'd expect from an MCU film. However, positively, it turns into something that fits in this universe.I enjoyed the action, score and humour. The cast do good things, with Paul Rudd filling the titular role nicely. I also really enjoyed Michael Douglas. Evangeline Lilly and Michael Peña are pluses, too. Corey Stoll, meanwhile, is a little meh I will say - entirely passable, but nothing memorable.This is a pleasant watch, one I'd recommend."
" Here come the 'Ant-Man' with a humorous bang
",0.3818,0.9965,2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Ant-Man is an action superhero movie directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stroll, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Pena, Tip T.I. Harris and David Dastmalchian in the leads.Frankly I enjoyed this movie and this is one of the fresh addition in the Marvel series with funny scenes and hilariously action-packed Joy ride. Paul Rudd arrives in the character of Ant-Man with a bang.The movie has an interesting plot and the director has given a superb introduction of the character. It seems that the director wasn't in a hurry for introduction of the character but still we wouldn't have minded if he would taken few more minutes for the development of the character.Acting is superb and Paul Rudd was superb in his character and it seems that the character was written for him. Although this is the first movie of the ant-man series but Paul Rudd was so perfect in his character it seems he is doing this character for long. Other cast and character were equally impressive.Screenplay of the movie was evenly paced and will keep you glued to the screen, action and VFX were also superb and should be appreciated. Climax of the movie is memorable and is different from other marvel movies.Overall a fun filled hilarious action comedy superhero movie that we all waiting for long time. A great arrival for Ant-Man."
" Super size me.
",0.5994,0.9305,2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"During the gap I had of MCU viewings between The Avengers (2012) and Captain America: Civil War (2016-both also reviewed) this was the title which I read the most about having troubles behind the scenes. Catching up on MCU movies I missed,I decided it was time to measure up a viewing.View on the film:Entering at the last minute after film maker Edgar Wright had quit after over a decade of developing the project, director Peyton Reed & Hard Target (1993-also reviewed) cinematographer Russell Carpenter retain some of Wright's unique stylisation with the hilarious use of Thomas The Tank Engine in the final action set-piece,and fluid, whip-pan, arc-shot edits to Lang (played with a bursting with charm energy by Paul Rudd) and his gangs snappy exchanges.Opening with impressive de-ageing that takes Michael Douglas back to the 80's, Reed sizes up Ant-Man with thrilling set-pieces that zoom-in on the flawless, glossy CGI with a enlargement of the insect world, via Lang walking deep into the colonies.Following Lang making a choice to become Ant-Man, the screenplay by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, with co-writers Adam McKay and Paul Rudd later adding Lang's face-off with Falcon, take the superhero origin set-up, and wonderfully twist it into a Sci-Fi Action Comedy heist flick, where Lang and his gang of former criminals (which includes Michael Pena funny snappy turn as Luis) fly onto the superhero side with encouragement from Hank Pym to stop the baddie putting the secret powers of Ant-Man under the microscope."

" Better than I expected
",0.4404,0.9797,2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"I have to be honest, I didn't really have high hopes for Ant-Man. I hadn't heard anyone praise it, and it just seemed like it was going to be a subpar, cheap superhero film released by Marvel. Fortunately, I was completely wrong, as this is a fun and entertaining movie from beginning to end. It's not flawless, there are a few things I didn't like. First of all, there are some serious structure problems present within the film, it doesn't flow very well. Secondly, the villain was very boring and didn't interest me at all, he was very forgettable. Those are pretty much my only big complaints though, as the rest of this movie is great. The characters are well written, and they're helped even more by some excellent performances, particularly Paul Rudd as the titular character. The cinematography is also great, and the action is well-filmed and includes some super creative set-pieces with some great cgi. The movie is also way funnier than regular Marvel movies, with some of the side characters doing almost nothing but crack jokes and still makes it work. If the movie was structured better, it would be one of my favorite MCU movies, but as it is, it's an entertaining, well-made superhero film that I don't regret watching."

Also, the shrinking effects are seriously impressive.I really enjoy Corey Stoll as the villain.

" Ant Man
",0.0,0.9991,2020-08-04 00:00:00,5,"Ant Man, directed by Peyton Reed, was a fun-filled, small scale film, that embraces what it is, for the better. Ant Man, like most MCU films, went through some tough production issues. They initially hired Edgar Wright to direct & write the film, but five rewrites of the script, and some contract disuptes later, Edgar Wright parted ways from the film. Marvel then hired Peyton Reed to direct, and Paul Rudd & Adam McKay to screenwrite. Peyton Reed added in a few decent shots, but this didn't feel like his film; it felt like someone trying to make a film like Edgar Wright, but missed on the execution. If Wright directed & wrote this film, like he should've, this could've easily been one of the MCU's best, having his style and energy pop off the screen.Peyton Reed did a good job with tying the film into the saga, setting up some acceptable, subtle exposition, but this just felt like safe, Marvel factory made film; In some ways, it feels like Peyton Reed borrowed some plot points from the first Iron Man film, and incorporated them here. I appreciated the different approach, going with a heist style film, but Reed spent so much time trying to fit the MCU quota, he wrapped himself into, too many underdeveloped subplots and characters, with an overwhelming barrage of jokes. The narrative has a nice fun tone for the majority of the time, but when they try for that menacing tone, it's laughable, and when they try for that emotional tone, it's too forceful. The pacing of the film isn't balanced well at all. Each act had a different pace, making the film feel not as cohesive as it should be.With a concept that's been used and abused, in order to get people in the seats, you need to have a likable cast; If you have even one character that doesn't work, the film will slowly deteriorate. Sarah Finn casted a lot of likable, and respected actors, but some of the characters didn't pay off as well as expected. Paul Rudd does such a good job in his role as Scott Lang/Ant Man. He brings this undeniable charm and likability to the character, with fantastic delivery to all of his lines, making it real easy to be invested in him. His character arch may be cliche, but he is going to be a nice addition to the avengers team. Evangeline Lilly puts a nice performance as Hope van Dyne, being a nice compliment to everyone on screen. She didn't have a whole lot to do in this film, being purposely shadowed, so it brings a nice edge to her character for the next film. Michael Douglas, man, that man is an actor! He fits the MCU scheme like a glove, putting on the best performance of the whole cast. Although his character has a few likabilities, and noble traits, he was underdeveloped for the amount of spotlight he had; it took some of the fame away from Scott Lang, and he needed all the spotlight he could get. Scott Lang's friends in Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I, are super annoying! McKay and Rudd try to give them enough to do to make them relevant, but they're just useless. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, is one of the worst, and most forgettable villains of the MCU. The small amout of potential his character had, was washed away by the way his character was written. They tried to give him a back story, but it was so forceful, and underdeveloped, leaving him to be a one dimensional villain.For a phase two film, there really wasn't a lot of action, but when it was there, it was presented in such a visually interesting way, with seamless effects, and so many colors blasting off the screen! You can tell that, before leaving, Edgar Wright choreographed most of the sequences, having his style all over it!Overall, Ant Man is another one of those films, where it's fun to revisit, but it's not one of those stand-out films, that belong at the top of the MCU list."
" Funniest Film in the MCU
",0.5574,0.9518,2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"SYNOPSIS:
Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is just released from Prison and promises an honest life, so he can provide for his daughter. However, after some pressure from his old crew, he gets back into the heist game to do one job that changes his life forever.REVIEW:
I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed this film. This was the only MCU film that I didn't watch when it actually came out. I wasn't very interested in the character. If I'm being very honest, Ant-Man is still probably my least favorite Avenger. With that being said, I really loved the back story to Scott Lang and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). I really felt bad for the situation that Scott Lang was in, while still knowing that it was all his own fault. One problem is obviously that he got back into the heist game. If this played out in real life, I'm 97.4% sure it wouldn't have turned out the way it did in this film. EVEN if it was a successful heist. It's one of those ""we'll look past it since his heart is in the right place"" things. I thought the Direction from Peyton Reed was done very well and more specifically the editing was done very well. Anything with effects like these always impress me, regardless if it's not the most impressive edit in today's film industry.This is probably a me thing, but I'm not a fan of the overly-evil-mad-scientist-villain thing. Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) was exactly that in this film. It could've been a far more subtle villain approach, which could also be on the Writer's behalf, but I don't always like putting the blame on the writers nor the actors. It's hard to know. There is also an absolutely huge discovery near the end of the film that bleeds into the sequel that makes no sense to me cause I couldn't believe that Lang figures it out, but after years and years, Pym never could figure it out. It seemed like such an incredibly simple idea too.There are a few flaws to the film, just like with almost every other film, but I do still find this to be up there among the funniest MCU films and it's a pleasure to watch. 7.4/10."

This is anothher MCU film. It's predictable and formulaic. But I think this is a much smaller film and i liked that. It s short and small so it knows what it is and just have fun. I love Paul Rudd he is really fun and naturally funny, Michael Douglas is always really good and another standout is Michael Peña who is hilarious. Characters were likeable and had chemistry. Emotional scenes were fine. Film is much more light hearted which i think is a breath of fresh air. It didn't do it as well as GOTG but it's still fun. It's a fun film. Pacing is fast and climax is very creative. I think emotional scenes didn't fit. It kinda drag in the middle. It was predictable and clichéd. Villain started out good but then it became boring cookie cutter forgettable villain. Even though action is fun and creative it isn't shot spectacularly. Whole film was boringly shot with no energy. If Edgar Wright directed the film it would have been great. Best jokes were ones that he wrote.
Overall: Predictable cliched but fun film."

Don't try to trick me with your double talk and pseudo science, the story sucks no matter how much you pump in to the special effects.I remember when collecting comics were fun and exciting, but Marvel and Disney and everyone else who tries to go in to this world thinking that they are in it for money rather than the artistic value, degrade the stories by pimping them out to the public as gutter trash.That's what this is all about and it is called profit.Gone are the cool stories which made up my childhood, the art work, the thought of waiting for a new issue next month and not about the collecting process. It was about being a kid and using my imagination.I like the special effects, but when you lack a story to go with it, then it is pointless.

" Ant man
",0.0,0.9899,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym - the original Ant-Man in the comic books - to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product - Peyton Reed's Ant-Man - is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world - including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) - aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle - a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man - from falling into the wrong hands.Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue - still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay - is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails - working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder - give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton - initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend - is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between lif"
" Fun film
",0.5106,0.9668,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,The MCU delivered another great movie with Ant-Man. I love the origin story behind Ant-Man and how they told it in this movie was awesome. It's a really touching lighthearted movie that works really well as a soft entry in the MCU. Add to that the final battle with the toys was a genius idea making for an awesome movie!

Just kidding, but he was an absolute scene-stealer.I think I had forgotten how fun and fresh Ant-Man is. Paul Rudd is terrific in the lead role, and almost every single secondary character is great. The humour is on point and never exaggerated, the pacing is formidable and the action scenes are all very fun. If only it had a more developed villain, it would be much higher in my MCU ranking, but it remains one of the most fun entries in the universe.Not going to lie, though, this particular viewing kind of got overshadowed by the spectacular trailer we got for Christopher Nolan's Tenet, my most anticipated movie of the year, this evening..."

" MCU Back on Track
",0.0,0.8729,2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"As a latecomer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I had heard a lot of negative opinions about Paul Rudd and Ant-Man. A few of the preceding instalments in the series (namely Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron) were quite frankly bad films, with very weak plot lines and very sloppy writing. This was much better. I love how these Marvel films experiment in crossing the boundaries between genres. In Ant-Man, we see your typical superhero origins story coupled with a classic heist movie. And for perhaps the first time in the MCU, our title character and hero is a down on his luck, ordinary (and relatable) guy just trying to hold down a normal job and maybe get to see his daughter at weekends. Our antagonist of Darren Cross (AKA Yellowjacket) is also a breath of fresh air, as his motives stem from a want of power and wealth - again more relatable than the Marvel accustomed seemingly groundless want for global destruction and genocide (think Aldrich Killian/The Mandarin, Malekith, Ultron etc). Overall I look forward to seeing more of Paul Rudd as the MCU progresses, right back on track."

",0.0,-0.9561,2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Ant-man doesn't bring any new for a superhero story. It is a cliche of character construction.
There only a relevant thing: the capacity of trying to using a well-based scientific knowledge to construct the ""superpower"", what makes it less bizarre, even when using special effects.
Besides that, there is need to develop a bad critic: the construction of all latinos characters is based on stereotypes of dumb, reckless, crime affected and funny. As a latino viewer, I felt offended about the incapacity of exploring in a less different and aggressive way all of this culture.
However, the acting, directing and cinematography are impeccable and all the characters construction, including the villain (what it is no expected of Marvel), are solid."

" Fun and silly...if not flawed
",0.5106,0.9987,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"We open almost twenty years before the first Iron Man in Nineteen eighty-nine. Dr. Hank Pym (a brilliant Douglas) is meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D's head of defence Mitchel Carson (a rather slimy Martin Donovan), along with Howard Stark and Peggy Carter. Pym has discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. are trying to replicate a very special and powerful formula of his for their own use and he vows they will never get their hands on it.After skipping back to the present time, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Perks of Being a Wallflower) is leaving prison (see the WHiH Exclusives regarding that) and is picked up by his old friend Luis (a wonderful Peña). Determined to now go straight and confident of landing a job with his Masters in engineering, Scott ends up working at a fast food joint in which he promptly gets fired due to his past transgressions.Unfortunatly for scott he ends up back with Luis and his associates who want him to join up for a job cracking a safe, which they learned about from brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. Meanwhile Hank Pym has been invited to Futures Lab at Cross Technologies for a presentation regarding a tiny super soldier headed up by Darren Cross, the former protege and student of Hank's. Darren is making huge strides in replicating Hank's formula is ready to sell it to the highest bidder (yup you guessed it, HYDRA).Now for myself this was an unusual Marvel superhero film. It never really feels like a superhero film and nor does it ever really feel like a Marvel film either. What it does feel like though is a typical Edgar Wright production and the whole film plays out more as a Wright comedy than a Marvel film. All it needed was Pegg and Frost to pop up and everything would have complete in the world. In all seriousness though, I'm very surprised neither were shoehorned in somewhere for a quick cameo (or I missed them).The plot line is a little convulated and uneccessary but it flows along nicely without any awkward moments and there is never really a moment where the film drags, though the start of the film left a lot to be desired and could have been stronger. The script is actually half-decent and fits the whole vibe of the film, though the comedy and one-liners are typical Wright, so if you are a fan of his you will know what to expect.Cast wise, everyone is pretty good here. Michael Douglas is excellent as one would expect but I really wasn't feeling Evangeline Lilly at all. She was much better in The Hobbit films. Paul Rudd, while never a favourite of mine is largely excellent and from what little I know, seems to fill the boots of the character very well. The three wombats (as Pym despairingly refers to them) provide the majority of the laughs with most of those coming from Peña.The special effects are pretty good and while there is nothing particularly outstanding happens in terms of explosive set-pieces, the miniature (or enlarged, depending how you see it) action scenes are pretty well filmed and do add a great sense of scale. There is a little too much blur in some of the sequences but it does not put you off visually too much. Likewise the soundtrack is also good and fades nicely into the background without being in your face (ala Iron Man).Overall Ant-Man is a fun film (if not a stellar character in Marvel's line up), and it is certainly helped along by great casting and Wrights script. Direction is adequate from (once again for Marvel) a primary television director. I didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did and while again the character is rather weak (from an interest point of view) this film does make the most of his rather modest attributes. A middle of the range movie for the cinematic universe.

When he comes out to his daughter and ex-wife (married to a cop), he can't even get a job selling ice cream. Desperate times call for desperate measures and he finds himself robbing a vault in which he discovers a strange suit. When he dons it, he shrinks to the size of an ant and attains super strength. Scared by this, he attempts to take it back but is arrested ninth attempt then finds himself enveloped in a complex plot lead by Michael Douglas (""Dr. Hank Pym"") to regain control of the company that built it all from the megalomanic control of Corey Stoll (""Darren Cross""). It's quite an enjoyable tech-fantasy and Rudd brings a good deal of fun to the role as he tries to save the world... The SFX are cleverly executed and it is fast paced. The dialogue, however is rather uninspiring and the set-piece nature of many of the action scenes grow repetitive after the umpteenth time. At 2 hours long, it could do with a bit of judicious trimming to compact it down a bit - but it is, nonetheless, quite an enjoyable comedy sci-fi."

Marvel have done well in being able to keep reinventing themselves and never taking themselves too seriously. Ant Man is a great edition to the Marvel universe. It seems fresh, unique and quirky.Ant Man is the superhero we can all relate to. He's the fanboy being in awe of the Avengers, not feeling part of the team. He's clumsy and makes lots of mistakes, as a new superhero should.Michael Pena was also very funny with his mates. His one liners gave the movie a light jokey feel throughout. Evangeline lilly was also a strong supporting actress, although her hairstyle seemed a bit odd.Marvel does seem to have an odd increase in its advertising though by this point. From around these movies onwards it seems to inlcude a lot more advertising than usual.

" Paul Rudd becomes Small Rudd
",0.0,0.9778,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoy that Marvel movies don't just stick with one genre. Just as Captain America was a war movie and a superhero movie, this is a heist movie and superhero movie. (Meanwhile at DC) It's pretty hard to get excited about a superhero who's only powers are shrinking and controlling ants. Especially because the original Ant-Man is not the main character, so if you're not familiar with the comics you may be confused. It's a different kind of Marvel movie. The theme of passing the torch has not yet been seen in any Marvel film. I loved that we've got the original hero passing on his legacy to a guy who really needs to change his life for the better. This has everything we've come to expect from an MCU movie. Humor, action, a good story, and cameos for the fans. It's reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy, a lot. And that's a good thing, because I enjoyed that movie a lot. It's because of this movie that Paul Rudd will forever be known as Small Rudd. It's not the best MCU movie, (so far, that's Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but it is a fun little movie that will be known as a gamble that Marvel took, that paid off in the long run.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

" Make us embark on a story with a content difficult to believe at first, and a good direction and cast
",0.1027,0.9995,2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Just as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' were a high stakes, so can 'Ant-Man'. The hero was at the foundation of the Avengers in the 60s, but he never held a big solo title or managed to migrate to the top echelon of the publisher and here he gains a golden opportunity to finally get recognition at the hands of director Peyton Reed, known for his romantic comedies ""Down with Love (2003)"", ""Separated by Marriage (2006)"" and ""Yes Lord (2008)"", but who had never taken on a major Hollywood blockbuster. Reed ended up replacing the acclaimed English director Edgar Wright, of the excellent ""Everybody Almost Dead (2004)"" and ""Scott Pilgrim Against the World (2010)"", who ended up abandoning the project due to creative differences shortly before filming began. This ended up worrying fans of the DC universe, but the final result on the screens delivers an exciting and fun adventure, which knows how to fully insert itself in the shared universe together with the other VIngers, but which, above all, manages to support itself only, establishing the hero for the general public.Forced to leave his own company by former protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits the talents of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief who has just emerged from prison. Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new abilities to prevent Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil, including selling the technology to HYDRA.The plot already begins showing Scott Lang the day he leaves prison after three years for committing an assault. Seeking to show that he's changed and wanting to make up for lost time, Scott needs to get a job, a place to live to try to see his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) again, but as a former inmate, he has a hard time getting a job. Because of this, he ends up deciding to return to the life of theft, unaware that he was being watched by Dr. Hank Pym, who sees him as the perfect person, for his willingness to redeem himself in order to live with his daughter again, his intelligence and abilities , to assume the identity of Ant-Man.When Ant-Man first appeared on the comic book pages, he was attended by Hank Pym, a scientist. Years later, he ends up giving up his secret identity in the name of a new volunteer, former thief Scott Lang. Dr. Pym, as a guardian, is a nearly retired genius, with only mentioning that he was the one who wore the Ant-Man costume previously (even shown in action alongside his wife many years before, when they participated in one of your missions in the past). The biggest hits of the script are precisely the emotional part, which accompanies a thief in the best Robin Hood style (who steals from the rich and gives to the poor) in search of redemption, trying to be a hero to his daughter, being 'the person who daughter already thinks he is'. That's the main motivation for Scott to want to change and start his life over, trying to do the right thing.In the following acts, we can follow the first contact that Scott has with the Ant-Man costume, the discovery of his powers, the escape from prison with the superhero costume, the initial training in fights to become agile fast and achieve shrink and increase in seconds for the suit to suit your needs, in addition to learning to communicate so you can command your army of ants. It is extremely interesting how the concept of Ant-Man is presented, explaining the various types of ants and how they can be useful with their faithfulness and teamwork, adapting to the need and situation. One could even have invested a little more in these scenes, since they show the evolution of Lang becoming Ant-Man, besides being extremely funny.Paul Rudd was a wise choice to play the miniature hero. He lends all his charisma to this interpretation. The interaction between Dr. Pym, Scott Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) flows fully. At first, considered Scott to be a bad choice to take on the hero's costume and wanting to take the lead herself, Hope starts to get more and more involved with Scott, dividing great scenes together, culminating even in something else towards the end of the projection . Michael Douglas does very well as a mentor and gives complete credibility to the brilliant scientist who seeks to prevent global chaos. Only his shaky relationship with his daughter Hope is overly dramatized. The impression that remains is that a conversation between father and daughter could have taken place a long time ago about the reasons that led him to want to protect his daughter all these years. Also worthy of note is Lang's little daughter, Cassie, who is super charismatic on the scene, in addition to companions and assault Kurt (David Dastmalchian), Dave (T.I.) and Luis (Michael Peña). The latter steals the show whenever he appears. The villain Darren Cross, the Yellow Jacket, played by Corey Stoll is not really a negative point, but the cartoonish tone of his villain clashes with a few more realistic interpretations of the rest of the cast.It is curious to see how the concept of Ant-Man, however unlikely, brings many possibilities through his technological suit. In the last third of the plot, we noticed these possibilities both in the form of resources used by Scott to fight the enemy, so much to be explored in the filming. Peyton Reed delivers a firm and daring direction, exploring camera movements and frames very well that show the back and forth of Scott's shrinking / rising, making us embark on the story and see the world through the eyes of the hero. The dimension changes in the most varied scenarios, causing people and objects to suddenly appear and disappear from the place where the action takes place is surprising and exciting, causing the pace to grow in a surprising way.We must also mention the links with the Marvel universe. All of them occur organically and not pushed in a way just to show that the film is inserted in the same space / time as the Avengers, who are mentioned by Scoot and Dr. Pym at a certain time. The main mention is related to Tony Stark, whom Dr. Pym has always wanted to avoid having contact with his technology because he considers it too complicated if it fell into the wrong hands. We also see Scott's first appearance before one of the Avengers, Falcão (Anthony Mackie) when he invaded the Avengers headquarters. The fight between Falcon and Ant-Man, besides being fun and creative, is a delight for movie fans. This meeting will result in the future participation of Ant-Man together with The Avengers. Even a quick quote to Spider-Man appears in the final scenes, implying that he is also close to showing up in future Casa das Ideias films. In the post-credit scenes, there are two scenes: one revealing the emergence of a new heroine and one with the participation of an original Avenger and one of the biggest villains in the Marvel Universe.Ant-Man is clearly a studio film that works very well with the formula in hand. Much of the humor that we already know so well is present, in addition to great visual effects that give realism and make us embark on a story with a content difficult to believe at first, and a good direction and cast. It is a great introduction to yet another hero in the world of the Avengers and his integration with the other heroes should not take long to occur. It's two fun and magical hours that fly by and make you anxious about what's yet to come with the character and the impending Civil War."

Paul Rudd is perfectly cast and it's about damn time he got some acclaim worthy of his every look and twist of phrase. Pena is a delight to be sure as well and even the criminally underused Corey Stoll is welcome.Some standout moments and comedic turns and sequences and set-pieces are a clever use of Ant-Man, however it plays everything too safe, doesn't revel in the archetypes or tropes of the heist genre as it should and instead abandons the language of those films and sticks to the even play of Marvel's homogenous family.Fully rubbery CGI third act is the bane of these cheap entries (Deadpool I'm looking at you).

" EXTREMELY UNDERRATED FILM!
",0.0,0.9651,2019-11-27 00:00:00,8,"As said in the title, this film is extremely underrated in my opinion, it may have to do with the smaller stakes amongst such big films in the MCU. Paul Rudd was made for this role (unless the role was quite literally made for him) and he has great chemistry with the actors around him. This films great comic relief through character such as Luis or through the increase/decrease of objects like the 'Thomas the Tank Engine' train set fight scene at the end.The film is very refreshing and entertaining, definitely worth the watch. Also there's a cool cameo from the Falcon which just reminds you that is part of the MCU."
" Obviously the product of a tortured production
",-0.5574,0.9393,2019-11-25 00:00:00,5,"His movie is intentionally light in contrast to the large movies that precede it. I think it's a good idea overall to vary a franchise's output in tone, scale, and even genre, but Ant-Man specifically doesn't really work.The problem is the fact that the main character has no real stake in the central conflict of the story. Scott Lang is an ex-con just released from prison for burglary who wants to go straight in order to be a good father to his little girl. After getting fired from Baskin Robbins because of his criminal past, he joins up with some other ex-cons to pull a small heist. He breaks into an old man's house, gets past both high tech and low tech security and walks away with a suit that he finds out later makes him the size of an ant. After some back and forth in prison, the old man, Hank Pym, recruits Lang to steal some technology from the company that Pym founded by had been kicked out of some decades before.And that's the actual conflict at the heart of the movie. It's between Pym and Darren Cross, the current CEO of Pym's company. Cross is recreating the Pym Particle, the techno-babble nonsense that makes the shrinking possible, a technology that Pym had created many years prior and tried to bury because of its potential implications and uses. Pym doesn't want Cross to get the technology because he sees in Cross some unstable elements, and he's right of course.What does Lang have to do with this fight? He's essentially a mercenary and never has any stake in the central fight itself. He gets roped in because of his need for money and Pym's desire to use his thieving skills (as well as his desire to protect his daughter Hope, who is also in on the plan), but he doesn't have the right level of interest to be the protagonist in this specific story. That's entirely Hank Pym. Pym is the protagonist, but he's built into the story as a secondary character. It creates a weird dynamic within the fabric of the narrative.On top of that, the movie's structurally odd. The entire second act is essentially one long training montage, and it drags. It's entertaining in spots, but ultimately it barely moves the story forward in any significant way. It's Lang sort of amusingly learning his skills while we get massive amounts of exposition about rules of the world, especially rules around ants.And yet, the movie has some entertainment. Paul Rudd is winning as Lang, and his thieving cohorts (led by Michael Pena) are amusing. The two times that Pena tells stories (the first to introduce the heist and the second the end the film and set up a bit in Captain America: Civil War), the editing becomes almost frantic in order to keep up with Pena's quick mouth. They're easily the most enjoyable moments of the film. It makes you wish the rest of the film had been told with a similar energy. The special effects are amusing and different. The juxtaposition of things like a toy Thomas the Tank Engine feeling threatening is enjoyable.However, the story overall is so poorly assembled with a main character that's not actually the protagonist, a below average antagonist, and a dragging second act, that I simply cannot find the fun in the work as a whole."

Ant-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, . it has good story and time line with ultron and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. And when looking for Howard's stark facility the for the stuff that controls the machine for the particle is on avengers soil this is fun when ant man encounters falcon because he breached security
Scot lange played Paul rudd shows a vulnerable side
The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job or not but when a job comes along he finds something or kinda faith plays a part in a job he stumbles upon that might save his life in San Francisco and her earns to be able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast. 8/10"

The scripting is slightly confusing when compared to the original animated version. Of course, copy pasting exactly would be a bad idea, since the animated movies, tv series are more dramatised. It's alright to have few alterations. The important thing is, storyline was good and also graphics was excellent, characters played nicely, a strong avenger was portrayed. So yeah, this was a FANTASTIC movie. Hit the screens guys, you'll love it. Awaiting Captain America: Civil War Too bad it's next year. :(Peace Out!"

However i did not care about this because the movie is very entertaining with good jokes and nice side charcters. I did enjoy the movie all the time and it feels more like 90 minutes than 2 hours. It really felt like other Edgar Wright movie, and as a big fan of Wright, that is a positive thing for me.Visually the movie is sometimes amazing (the sub-atomic room), most times good, but sometimes really ugly. I hate the clean Marvel look and here this is always the case. Sometimes the animations look good, but sometimes it is very ugly and too much.I can however not give this movie 8/10 because i hated the antagonist. Not because of his character and how evil he is, but because he is so boring and there is nothing interesting about him."

Paul Rudd is great in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances. The cg is great and the action sequences are extremely impressive.

Michael Pena is hilarious. Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym. Love the ant man suit and the villain Darren Cross is under appreciated. Darren Cross was sorta stabbed in the back by Hank Pym his mentor. The Yellow Jacket suit is so cool. The whole 3rd act fight is so unique and great.

" Amazing!!
",0.658,0.9988,2019-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This is the very first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that I saw and I love it!!
Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a non-violent and very likeable crook who is just being released from prison and decides that he wants to start over to provide for his little girl. But he is unable to hold down a job. He is offered a job - to break into a safe in an old man's house. But he finds nothing in the safe except for a strange suit. He goes home and tries it on - and winds up getting involved in a breaking-in job to save the world.
(Again, I apologise about the bad movie synopsis).
Paul Rudd is great as Lang. He is charming and hilarious. Though, I have one qualm with Lang's character - he tends to spoil some truly great or emotional scenes.
Michael Douglas is amazing as Hank Pym. The calm, straightforward man who hires Lang, Douglas really brings him to life.
Loved the way they handled the budding romance in this and there is some well-done character development.
The shrinking technology was fun and sometimes hilarious to watch - particularly in the climax.
Some have called this 'weird' or 'odd'. While I can understand why they think this way, I don't think it is. It's science fiction and great fun to watch. Great fun and really engaging. Loved Luis and his storytelling scenes. It's cheesy, but a fun cheesy. At first I really wanted more scenes where he is telling a story, but then realised that it would soon get old and his scenes wouldn't have the same charm. Luis really steals all the scenes he's in.
A definite recommend."

I thought it had great visual effects and showed it more effective. I was impressed with some scenes. For example, he was sucked into a drain and flew on the ant. I felt it was similar to Alice in Wonderland! At first, I felt a lot of ants very creepy, but it was funny that I saw them cuter in the last half.The most exciting thing was the way to show that Antman made the enemy consused by controling his size freely in the battle!"

Paul Rudd is pretty charismatic in this film. And Michael Pena was hilarious in this movie. The action scenes are fun to watch as well. However the villain, hornet, is pretty forgettable. It doesn't really make sense why he's evil because it isn't explained well. So overall, Ant-Man is another pleasant surprise in the MCU."

You can definitely see Mkcay and Wright in this script. And you can corporate dipping their hands in the pot. Even though it wouldnt have matched with the cinematic universe it still makes you wonder what it what have been like with just the clear vision of Edgar Wright. When the jokes work they really work. When they fall flat they fall flat. But there are great visuals, and very clever usues of the ant suit power and the concept. Like the shower scene. Like alot of marvel movies, it's got big flaws. Like one of the most underwhelming villains yet. But it's also alot of fun. And has some surprises. A very fun new superhero. One that we havent seen before.

Ant-Man didn't take itself too seriously which I think was key but there was some great action and some top humour. Unfortunately I found some of the jokes miss their mark but Ant-Man was a steady almost heist movie which shows a lot of potential ahead of sequels or an Avenger performance. Im new to Ant-Man but found the superhero something a little different and likewise the movie, it was a refreshing movie in the Marvel series and posed flashbacks in similarities to the original Iron Man film."

Her acting, her hair.

What was that ritual to say goodbye from prison - just to show that the hero is also tough? And what was that hispanic music playing? Also have you tried finding something in other peoples homes? I got to say at least for myself that even if they say where that thing is I still need a good chunk of time to find it. He had to find 3-4 things to take a copy of the fingerprint (and this didn't impress Pym but rather the cooling of the safe) and then he had to find the tools to freeze the safe and the process itself - and all this in the 20 minutes when the alarm was off.

It more like a classic Sci-fi ---Creature Feature hybrid with splash of super-hero fun for good measure.Paul Rudd did a great job of being a guy who is struggling in life and made some bad decisions even if they were for good intentions. He got the humour right and played the action right as well. Michael Douglas was well cast as Hank Pym and the story was really good from start to finish. The humour in this film was brilliant .

The villain of this movie is nice. He isn't very complex but he is shown as the villain from the very start and isn't super important. He does look cool though. The family aspect of the film is great, especially because both Hank and Scott spend the film dealing with father-daughter relations. Scott Lang is one of the most regular avengers along with hawkeye, his character is relatable to most and he is fun and casual, something that was missing in the MCU outside of Peter Quill. The concept of shrinking tech allows for very fun and well choreographed fight sequences. It is also funny, the whole movie has a sizable amount of Marvel charm and that that is only emphasized by Michael Peña's hilarious personality."

His wife (Judy Greer) is about to move on with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale).In a subplot Dr. Hank Pym is played by Michael Douglas who comes on the scene, almost doing an aside, and says ""I'm still alive."" He was part of a company that shrinks the space between atoms. It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first ""Iron Man"" again which isn't too bad, just predictable.

Like most people I have to believe that the Edgar Wright version would have been better but I must say that Peyton Reed did a pretty great job piecing what he had together.
" not as flashy, which makes it better

An unconventional hero in the making, operating in the (tiny) shadowy corners of the big guys, loads less bling and bells and whistles (but still a decent amount of fun with dazzling camera panning) which makes this a very welcome addition to the MCU!"
" A lighthearted and action packed addition to the MCU
",0.4215,0.9907,2019-04-07 00:00:00,8,"One might shy away from this movie due to Ant-Man not being a well known or beloved marvel character ,but after watching this movie, I can tell you that would be a huge mistake. The film is packed with action that enthrall the viewer from the start to the end. The action is coupled with masterful CGI that does not take away from the overall feel of the movie. In addition to the action the brilliant cast brings lighthearted comedy throughout the movie which acts as a much needed break from the action. For a character that is not widely known by the general crowd of average movie-goers, the movie does an excellent job of character building. One can begin to understand the history of each character and see them grow as a person as the movie progresses. As an avid Marvel fan, I found Ant-Man to be a worthy addition to the MCU ,and an overall great movie for all ages."

Paul Rudd did a really nice job as the well-meaning thief who is called on by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to pull a heist to stop the nefarious Yellowjacket. The special effects and cinematography are really cool. (Russell Carpenter, the guy who did the cinematography for this film, also did the cinematography for The Indian in the Cupboard, another small-size movie) The fight scenes are really fun to watch as well. Overall, while it is formulaic, it is still a fun film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Stay after the credits for an extra scene!"

" Kind of a mess, but still fun in a bite-sized way
",0.5719,0.9916,2019-03-31 00:00:00,6,"Falling squarely in the ""overlooked and somewhat underappreciated"" camp of Marvel films, 2015's 'Ant-Man' was not our typical effort from the studio. The Paul Rudd/Michael Douglas/Evangeline Lilly-starrer was a little bit goofy, kind of awkward but still fun, and for that reason it remains one of the odd men out among the bigger, badder entries from the 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America' franchises.'Ant-Man' has a few things going for it, namely Rudd. He's the unlikely underdog superhero in the vein of Spider-Man, falling into his role and needing to live up to sizeable expectations. Rudd is perfectly cast for this part, as his ""aw shucks"" personality and non-intimidating demeanor make him an unassuming agent. Lilly's Hope van Dyne is the kind of unpredictable, cutthroat semi-villain who could be just as helpful as she could be dangerous, and her onscreen father, Douglas's Dr. Pym is a likeable grandfatherly mad scientist type. Together, they make a band of renegades who might just have what it takes to thwart evil corporate suit Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). We also see some surprising supporting roles, from a bumbling Michael Pena to an ""on autopilot"" T.I., plus it's good to see Anthony Mackie as Falcon in a creative, pretty funny matchup with the Ant-Man himself.But don't go thinking this film is one of the stronger offerings in the franchise. It's not. In fact, 'Ant-Man' feels like it was created just for the sake of giving Rudd's Scott Lang a starring role just so he could make it into other films ('Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' come to mind).'Ant-Man' should be enjoyed for what it is - a fun, wild ride in a modern 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' kind of way."

So Scott uses his new powers to save the day.The visuals are great,the story is good and I really enjoyed Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. The action sequences are great too.Stick around for the credits as their is two post credit scenes. One involving Evangeline Lily becoming the Wasp,by seeing the wasp costume and the other one has Chris Evans in it."
" Missed the mark
",-0.296,0.77,2019-03-19 00:00:00,6,"This will not be the popular opinion. This movie just didn't work for me. I think it started to go wrong for me with the casting: Paul Rudd is not a favourite of mine, mostly because he goes over the top in his comedy (he may be going for endearing but he lands at silly), which was just amplified in Michael Pena's role; then, there was the lack of personal dynamics. How did they mess up letting Evangeline Lilly do what she does best - good, heartfelt, emotive performances? There was no chemistry with any of the relationships (except maybe with Ant-tony). The villain was mundane and barely threatening. Otherwise, the CGI was creative and dynamic, the potential of the bare bones premises are still there. It just fell flat for me. I can't give this film any more than a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
" Should Be A Bigger Part of the MCU
",0.0,0.9973,2019-03-18 00:00:00,8,"This for me is without a doubt one of the best MCU films. If not Marvel films in general, to come out in recent years. But this film is riddled with plot holes. With an intelligently written, charming and hilarious script. My main worries were how they would introduce Ant-Man since in the comics, he would not be suitable for the MCU. They did manage to nail it. Originally Hank Pym was going to be the Ant-Man in the movie. Favorably they changed since there was a lot of controversy with the storylines surrounding Hank Pym in the comics. They did add him as a secondary character because he is a pretty huge part of Marvel either way. The opening was incredible. The film was very unpredictable. I loved the scenes where it presented the plot twist. I was very surprised to see a different superhero other than Ant-Man in the film. Anthony Mackie's Falcon appeared and it was a surprise - I feel like we don't get enough of the lower tier Avengers in these movies.Paul Rudd played the protagonist Ant-Man, under the name of Scott Lang. He was hilarious in his role. And I can't wait to see him in future MCU films. I loved his aim. Unfortunately, the antagonist did not have a clear goal. Corey Stoll played Yellow Jacket. He was fine nothing incredibly impressive. The other side characters were Hope and Hank Pym - they were played by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly. Their backstory was incredible. I did think the relationship between Hope and Scott was ominous - I don't know why. Michael Peña was a nice addition to the film and he was phenomenal. An amazing way to introduce the Wasp and the Quantum Realm.I loved about this movie was its use of CGI and special effects with him shrinking. Some great fighting scenes, especially the one in which they make the colossal train. The age of the movie should be PG, for violence and mild language instead of 12. As I mentioned earlier, stuffed with giant plot holes. How does he manage to climb on a gun when small, even though according to the movie's physics - when he shrinks his original density stays the same? I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I love this movie."
" A smaller film in the MCU
",0.0,0.9348,2019-03-18 00:00:00,8,"This has to be one of the funniest entries in the MCU, Paul Rudd was born to play Ant-Man. I especially love the comedy and how it uses it to tell the story. Yellowjacket though wasn't that interesting of a villain. He wasn't well developed and kind of boring, but the movie was an origin story for Ant-Man, so he served his purpose. All in all, an excellent origin film for a great character."
" A fun little movie for fans of comedy and heists.
",0.7003,0.9611,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"In the never-ending array of superheroes feeding into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to support such franchises like Captain America and The Avengers, it can be difficult to make some of the B-tier and C-tier heroes seem interesting enough to devote a whole movie to them. To ensure each movie feels different from its predecessors, certain unique attributes must be applied. Whether it's the sci-fi-themed Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) or the mind-bending visuals of Doctor Strange (2016), each film requires a gimmick to make it work. For Ant-Man (2015), it's comedy.If you approach Ant-Man as a standard superhero film, you're likely to be disappointed. There are almost too many off-hand references to much of the MCU to make anyone not familiar with the vast array of movies lost and confused. Plus, the hero's ""origin story"" in Ant-Man is almost par for the course. However, if you watch this film with the understanding that it's more similar to comedy/caper/heist films than a superhero film, you're likely to be satisfied. From Michael Peña's third-party information chains to some of the physical comedy involved with the ants, the movie is fun to watch.And while Edgar Wright (of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and Baby Driver (2017) fame) didn't end up directing this movie, his influence in the screenplay is certainly recognizable. Of course, Ant-Man also owes a debt of gratitude to other ""shrinking"" films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), just as much as it owes to Bokeh photography and any number of heist films (like Ocean's Eleven (2001)). Sure, CGI made much of this film possible, but without the ridiculous nature of a shrunken world infused into the plot, it would have been more boring than fun.A fun little movie for fans of comedy and heists, I give Ant-Man 4.0 stars out of 5."

The first 20 minutes are boring and way longer than they need to be, but I guess that is the main and only issue. Otherwise, the casting chosen for the movie fits the bill perfectly, Paul Rudd fits so well with the other Marvel superheroes and Avengers that is astonishing how well they know who to choose to play their heroes. I always liked Michael Douglas and I was so happy when I saw him here cause right away I knew he was going to play an important role. Lilly is a well known actor from her days with Lost and many other movies so it was a no brainer to be aware of her acting capability. The CGI was over the top because every time Scott shrinked into The Ant-Man it felt natural, as natural as it can be. Altho it is obvious it is artificial, still it looks so well blended with the real parts of the movie( most of all I likes the interactions that Ant-Man was making with the ants all the time). The antagonist was also great with an awesome looking suit, altho maybe I would like a bit more screen time with fighting(also that fight with Falcon was a very positive surprise)"

I am a little bit afraid of what this movie could mean for ""the rules"" in future MCU movies. Sometimes they introduce the craziest things in this franchise which allow for the impossible to happen. And every movie just gets a little crazier.
But that's what this Marvel universe is for, to sparkle fantasy and make things happen on the cinema screens which wouldn't be imaginable in real life."
" Superhero movie not like the others
",-0.2755,0.8713,2019-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Ant-Man is a bit of a different movie than others I have seen. Sure, it is not like Deadpool, but it does have an interesting aspect: a superhero who does not have superpowers, a bit like Batman & Robin, Iron Man, or Spider Man who each depend on their gadgets but have no superpowers of their own. In that way, this movie sorta reminded me of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Still, it does not subvert the superhero genre but carefully stays inside of it, even tying to the Avengers, even though commanding ants with gadgets is kinda cool. The movie did not have the strongest plot though, with the typical ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" who worked on a government project, and it could have been more developed. For instance, at one point Michael Douglas breaks out of the lab with a big tank, and the helicopter with Corey Stoll and his henchmen. I don't understand why the tank doesn't fire at the helicopter, blowing it up, killing Stoll, rather than Paul Rudd as Ant Man leading the ants to attack. But, plots of these movies don't always make sense.So this wasn't the worst movie I saw, but if it was between this and other superhero movies (apart from Deadpool), I would recommend this one. Paul Rudd does a good portrayal as Ant-Man and Michael Douglas (as Hank Pym) is always good. While Evangeline Lilly as Hope is good, as is Bobby Cannavale as Paxto, among others, Michael Pina as Luis is annoying. I know he is supposed to be comic relief but he is more annoying than anything else.With all that is why I rate this film 5 stars."

If you like action and comedy genre, you should watch this movie for me, Ant-man is the best movie, of the world, the story is so good, this film has a big budget. The distribution is great. The Ant-man is a film by marvel. The creator of the marvel play in the movie in a short moment. The friend of the principal actor speaks extremely fast and it's funny.

The whole movie felt rushed.
They give Hope a character arc and they resolve it after 40 minutes, they don't even develop Hope as a character, she just is mad at Hank for not telling the truth and all that and then Hank talks to her for awhile and all is resolved.
Scott is a decent character he goes through a decent character having a clear goal that is personal and he cant achieve that goal cause of his background so he has to change which is a pretty good character arc in my opinion.CGI
The CGI is the best part in this movie.
How it looks when Ant-Man is small is very good and when Ant-Man fought Cross looked beautiful.VILLAIN
The villain is horrible.
He has a trashy motivation that is to sell the yellow jacket for money.
He has no development at all he is just this lousy villain that cant be taken serious.VERDICT

Evangeline Lilly will make a great wasp, Michael Douglas was a super Hank Pym. The script was funny, plot good and special affects great also. For those that don't read comics these are actually big players in the Marvel Universe. I guess what it boils down to is that Ant-Man just isn't one of my favourite superheroes so it's hard to get over excited about this movie, more than say a Thor or Logan. I also think it is aimed maybe at a younger audience. It's a decent watch tho and I think many will absolutely love it and can understand why many will give it a higher rating."

I felt Ant-Man was very carefully done with a lot of attention putting into it in setting up the scene, background, characters, etc.
Some say it doesn't give a superhero-movie feeling but I actually like how down-to-earth and more ""realistic"" it is. It gives a new taste to Marvel's heroes movies.

While the villain Darren Cross isn't really anything special, Corey Stoll does his best to work with what he was given and also props to Evangeline Livy as Hope Van Dyne who is given even more character development in the sequel which I have yet to see.Overall, it was a good film even though it's smaller scale (pun intended!) in terms of storytelling and it doesn't really kick off til after the 30 minute mark.This is one of Marvel's best movies and one of Marvel's best characters who is very important to the Marvel mythos, the Quantum Realm will play a significant role in Avengers 4 as will Ant-Man and the Wasp."

As a matter of fact, he has been so successful that he is even considering using his research on humans. And the one thing he doesn't want is for his project to fall into the wrong hands. So in order to prevent that he has kept the most important research strictly to himself. What he doesn't count on, however, is his devious assistant ""Darren Cross"" (Corey Stoll) maneuvering behind his back and taking over the corporation and continuing with the same research with a goal to sell this technology to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, another man named ""Scott Lang"" (Paul Rudd) has just gotten out of prison and is trying to make a new life for himself. Unfortunately, few places want to hire a former convict and in a moment of desperation he is convinced by some friends to break into the home of a wealthy man and steal all the money and jewels from the safe. But upon finally cracking the safe all Scott finds is a strange uniform and nothing else of any value. Realizing that this is rather odd Scott eventually puts on the uniform and discovers that his body has shrunk to an incredibly small size and that there are dangers all around him because of it. It's at this time that he hears a voice in his helmet which advises him on what to do next. What he doesn't know is that the voice belongs to Hank Pym and that he has been chosen for an assignment of incredible proportions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good ""comic book"" movie which contained a good mixture of both action and comedy. Admittedly, the ending was somewhat predictable but even so it still remained quite entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

",0.0,0.9959,2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"Ant-Man finally has a live-action movie! 3 years ago, and I watch it like every month. It's one of my favorite characters in Marvel Comics, and it finally has a movie, and it was as i expected.. disappointed me in some points, but as a whole movie, it's so charming!I found it boring sometimes, because of the slow-telling. I really believe that if they just got attention for some points they totally just let it go in the movie and the comics, it would have been the best MCU movie of all time.The cast is super-funny together, but once again the creators didn't gave them the chance to unleash their entire sense of humor... But it stills a funny movie though.The story is rich, but not that rich I wanted as I said up there. But the story STILL has a very powerful concept that I truly enjoyed!The performance was really talented and amazing, the cast gave me a great movie with their acting, especially Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man.The CGI was not really good, it was fine actually.So as a result, Ant-Man gives me a great time watching it, entertained at everytime I watch, so I'm gonna give it 8.5/10, but there isn't a half star in rating, and it doesn't deserve a 9, so I'm gonna give it 8 stars out of 10, but for me I give 8.5/10"

1. Michael Peña and the rest of the crew are genuinely decently funny
2. Paul Rudd is doing his best and his best is genuinely touching sometimes
3. Evangeline Lilly hot & buff (& sad, find her mom pls)
4. Michael Douglas is... probably trying his best too, could do better though
5. I love Cassie Lang and you can quote me on that
6. The Michael Peña-narrated scenes are genuinely some of the funniest things I've ever seen
7. Tardigrades! Please bring them back in the next movie
8. Ant puns restricted to ant names. Acceptable. Rip Antoni.
9. Far fewer plot holes than average Marvel movie. Damn good heist movie too
10. One star off for sheep jelly and the fact that he had that tank on a key chain despite the fact that it would still weigh as much as a tank
11. Clever use of shrinking abilities to mix up the action scenes in the movie from what we're used to. Excellent job on that
12. Ant training montage. Very good. This pleases us
Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. This has been Ants. Ants. Ants. Ant-Man!"
" Rating: B
",0.0,0.9997,2018-08-15 00:00:00,7,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Casting and characters. These are two things that Marvel never does wrong. Every character in the MCU is somehow perfectly portrayed by their respective actor or actress. I rarely (not to say never) look at a performance from this franchise and think ""maybe he/she was not the right person for this role."" Once again, they nailed the casting and the character's scripts.Paul Rudd is terrific as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. He is astonishingly charismatic and puts a lot of his humorous expressions into his display. Lang is a highly captivating character with a compelling past which causes him to struggle in the present. People judge him by something he did and not by why he did it. He keeps fighting that unfair discrimination back, but injustice seems to prevail. The writers do a wonderful job of making the audience care for him without it feeling forced. Phenomenal work on creating a new superhero with a great backstory and heartfelt motivations.Two other exceptional castings are Evangeline Lilly as Hope and Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym. Both share an emotional attachment, and they are connected to the most interesting and touching subplot of the entire film. For a generic origin movie, having such a remarkable yet predictable side-story is a plus since it helps the film's flow by providing more enjoyable scenes.Hope is an outstanding character, and Lilly grants her this badass personality which I honestly love. She can get herself deep into her role and seamlessly impersonate Hope's feelings, delivering some really emotional moments. Michael Douglas is a legend, and he proves that he still has a lot to give. Excellent portrayal of Hank and fabulous chemistry with Lilly and Rudd. Michael Peña is also very funny as Luis, and he is the main source of the trademark Marvel comedy, spread throughout the movie.The action is undeniably unique. Watching what would be a regular action sequence in a small-scale is awkwardly exciting, fun and extremely entertaining. I love how Peyton Reed approaches these sequences as well as Ant-Man's training. The CGI is top-notch, and the fights choreography is pretty good. I have to praise the editing of these set pieces because it definitely improves them by transmitting to the spectator a comprehensive view of what is happening.I don't really have what I usually call flaws. I mean, this is an origin film, so I was not expecting a masterpiece. I never do with this sort of movies. The goal of these films is to introduce a new superhero to the MCU and do it right. Do it in a way that the audience can understand where the protagonist is coming from, what are his motivations and naturally create an interesting and entertaining story that can supplement that character development. As far as origin movies go, this is yet another success for Marvel.The only thing I might complain about is the villain. Corey Stoll is fine but his character, Darren Cross, is just another guy who wants to make money out of potentially dangerous equipment. There is an intriguing part of his past that he shares with Hank and I wish they could have explored that a bit more. It would have surely given a whole other layer to an otherwise cliche villain.Besides that, everything is at least good. The screenplay is good. It is nothing mind-blowing or ground-breaking, it is just a generic superhero origin story, but Reed makes good use of it. The comedy is good. It delivers some chuckles, but it does not leave me laughing like crazy. Even the action, while it is undoubtedly unparalleled, is a hair above good. It is not absolutely awesome like Winter Soldier or Civil War. It is a good origin film, that is it.Ant-Man is another successful MCU's superhero origin movie. Once again, the casting is perfect. I can't see anyone else portraying Scott Lang besides the hilarious Paul Rudd. I feel the same way with Evangeline Lilly as Hope. Both deliver some excellent performances, as well as Michael Douglas. The original action set pieces reduced to an ant-scale, are super fun and exciting. It is a good origin film, and that is it. No mind-blowing story, no incredible villain, no jaw-dropping action, no epic score. It is just good, and I had the right amount of fun watching it. Primary mission accomplished: fantastic casting for a significantly developed superhero and his future sidekick."

" Refreshingly, this feels like a heist film first and a superhero film second.
",0.3612,0.9615,2018-08-06 00:00:00,7,"'Ant-Man (2015)' is essentially a heist film that's told with the tried-and-tested tropes of that genre, until it suddenly isn't and it ends in the kind of 'hero versus villain-with-the-same-powers' punch-up that marks it as the more generic - and, ultimately, middling - 'Marvel movie' fare it actually is. Still, there's plenty of fun to be had during the swift and sometimes emotionally-resonant narrative, especially considering that it manages to ostensibly be a comedy without calling attention to itself (in the way something like 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' does). In this way, it feels very natural and character-driven, comically and otherwise, throughout. It's also able to keep its core players keenly in focus at all times, making for a generally more personal journey. This results in a picture that's actually rather distinct from its peers but still very much sits among them, an example of an entertaining and engaging superhero film that finds its footing as something not entirely encapsulated - or, indeed, determined - by the broadest definition of that moniker. 7/10"

" Smaller in size and scale but no less creditible
",-0.4215,0.9782,2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Paul Rudd as the would-be hero brings lots of verve and self-confidence and good comic timing to the role. Ant-Man as a film, in comparison to earlier releases in the Marvel canon, isn't nearly as tightly packed and bombastic and it doesn't exhibit the same kind of rapid, choreographed fighting but it is no lesser film for it. We enter the strange world of the miniscule - where science would present big problems according to shrinkage and theories like ontogenetic allometry - but pay no heed to instincts or science - this is an imaginative comic fantasy. Most of the fun is in the knowingness of its place in the Marvel series for many viewers and the unlikely hero quality of Ant-Man compared to the Avengers. The most touching aspect, though, is his hero like quality to his daughter. There is a feeling by the mid-point of the film that it is positioned to step up the gears and become a full epic treat but sadly that doesn't happen. Nonetheless it is a competent heist film and with good support from Michael Douglas as the troubled scientist."
" Good MARVEL fun at the movies.
",0.8668,0.6486,2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Ant-Man was commissioned before Spider-Man returned to the MCU's fold, and I reckon it's good that in spite of the wall-crawler returning to Marvel, it's good that Ant-Man is still having his little universe expanded upon further in the Avengers movies; and of course his own Ant-Man movies.For those of you who don't know anything about the character (like I do not) this movie doesn't depend upon you watching EVERY MCU film out there or anything like that; this is not a homework-y type of movie. It's good dumb and Honey-I-Shrunk-The-Kids-inspired fun but with a superhero sleeve.Ant-Man gets 3.5/5 stars."

There is a giant ant that has morphed inside the house and runs out past the local pigs. The cop looks at it and says ""that's a messed up looking dog.""Yup. I have nothing else to add.PS: At least the one and a half women in this film are super thin and hard bodies. Unfortunately the only woman has short hair."

" It's a little generic, but a lot of fun.
",0.6652,0.966,2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"It's amazing that, despite all of the production issues involving Edgar Wright's departure, 'Ant-Man' turned out good. The film has a consistent tone and manages to feel like one complete vision. Ant-Man's powers make for a unique superhero tale with some interesting action and the origin story is an entertaining one that keeps its characters at its heart. The film also makes a good attempt at humour which, while not always successful, feels welcome as it fits with the characters and isn't out of place. It isn't a perfect superhero film, however. The character arcs and overall narrative are extremely predictable, and the villain is an especially weak one. It never really breaks the mould, but it doesn't seem like it's trying to. Instead 'Ant-Man' focuses on delivering lots of fun and it does that that in spades. Plus, Christophe Beck's memorable soundtrack is one of the best in the entire MCU. 7/10"
" Paul Rudd, the universal everyman, short, cheeky and always forever Paul Rudd
",0.0,0.9625,2018-07-11 00:00:00,6,"I don't want any superhero films, ever. No interest. I gave this 6 stars because it would be unfair to give a film a bad review because of that reason. It seemed fine for those who know the comic or love the genre, good special effects and music and acting. My problem is Paul Rudd. Is it possible to see a film without Paul Rudd perhaps? Yes, he seems lovely. He seems funny and short and loveable and...Paul Rudd. Whether he tries or not he is pretty much always Paul Rudd. I just can't believe he is in such a heroic and powerful role? Why was he cast? Is there really such a shortage in the whole world that little Paul Rudd was cast as a superhero? The dude can act and I on'y have a problem with him personally but he is hard to take seriously in this film, I believe. He has kind eyes and is reasonable and like an out of shape once cute dad. He's little and geeky-cool. Like always gets the girl but screws up. Anyway, that's just my opinion. I can't believe the film didn't include that kind of camp chicken dance he seems to do often as well, it would have been the icing on the cake.
Just waiting for him to appear in a horror film now as Paul Rudd, with a different hairstyle as that is the only thing that ever changes."
" Edgar Wright's Loss is Keenly Felt
",-0.0772,0.9268,2018-07-10 00:00:00,4,"The film just seems so tone deaf. Losing Edgar Wright off the film was a huge blow and a great example of why cinephiles follow directors and writers more than actors. Paul Rudd is a funny guy and a decent lead but when he isn't being written for and directed by a person with as much talent as him, he's just stuck in a middle-ing movie, delivering middle-ing lines.In the end, ""Ant Man"" seems more like the sort of film Edgar Wright would normally make fun of, not write."

" ""Ant-Man"" - A Strange, Yet Well-Executed and Funny Movie
",0.2732,0.9991,2018-06-23 00:00:00,7,"Ant-Man is a great film for fans of superhero movies, or the MCU in particular. It tries very hard to be a funny and remarkable film, which it ultimately succeeds in being. The heroes and villains really put this film in a special place where it becomes more like a thriller than a Marvel movie, but still keeps the vibe you would expect from anything with Paul Rudd in it. It mainly shows the titular Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd, embark on a journey to save the world, but also prove himself to the people in his life.However, all this film really does for the superhero genre is cement how an experimental film like Guardians of the Galaxy can become a success both in the box office and with critics. The only thing that doesn't truly make it as great a film as Guardians of the Galaxy was is its by-the-numbers elements. But even with its faults, the good far overshadows the bad. It's a hilarious picture, that uses its overuse of action and bright, blinding colors to its advantage. At times, it's very hard to tell whether you're watching an action film or a comedy. It also does the best with what it has: A semi-popular hero with obscure characters and a small fanbase. Even with such a small interest, it knocks so many other movies from that year out of the park.Michael Douglas really portrays an older version of Hank Pym like that was the role he was born to play. Truly excellent and honest to the comics. Evangeline Lily does the job of Hope Van Dyne AKA The Wasp, and boy does she do it well. She manages to be a total badass, but still keep her character balanced and level. Corey Stoll plays a maniacal villain. Enough said (although I believe his performance was least convincing, he still did awesome). Abby Fortson was cute and charming, and still keeps her dad going, which is heartwarming and sweet. But no one, I repeat, NO ONE, can forget the star of Ant-Man: Michael Peña's, Luis, the funniest and greatest character in all of Ant-Man. His jokes are the best, and he really gives Ant-Man a buddy-buddy aesthetic. Other great performances were given by Bobby Cannavale, Tip Harris, David Dastmalchian, Anthony Mackie, Wood Harris, Judy Greer, John Slattery, and Hayley Atwell.Overall, Ant-Man is a charming and funny movie. Even if it's just to introduce Ant-Man into the MCU, it still is a great film for casual or diehard fans. It wants to be a defining picture in its genre, but it really is dragged down by its basic elements, even though I liked it. 8 out of 10!"
" The smallest superhero
",0.0,0.9995,2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,"Undoubtedly, each of us in childhood had favorite superheroes that we admired. They were in demand and needed, because they always taught a good cause: they clearly demonstrated how to be persistent and strong; how to overcome difficulties and obstacles; To reach heights and conquer new horizons; be able to love and offer a helping hand in a difficult moment; and most importantly - to remain yourself, soul and heart. Such acts and good deeds invariably evoked feelings of pride and enthusiasm, and it was so attractive and tempting that they could not help imitating them - fluttering like a smoke out of everyday everyday life and moving towards a huge peace, in the name of his own salvation. Sometimes it happens that patriotism prevails over soulfulness, and after all the lofty and ambitious, at times haughty and arrogant projects about superheroes, I want to take a break, to look at something that is not burdensome, unconstrained, perhaps even modest and simpler, closer to my liking. Following the loud and sensational ""Era of the Altron"", the company Marvel, provides just such an opportunity, providing in his universe a place of an Ant-Man, whose name is not so popular and known as other heroes, but nevertheless, it is needed for the purpose of a full set , and also for the completion of the second phase of this very carnival.The man-ant. In the past, he was Dr. Hank Pym, now - burglar and thief Scott Lang. People do not shout at all, do not shout out his name, they do not sing praises in his honor, but the gifts given by Pim, in particular the reduction in size, clearly stand out Scott on the background of other superheroes, and, of course, find an interesting and fascinating application for themselves. Scott is far from hopeless, like many others, he also has his advantages, in fact skillfully breaks through protective mechanisms. In the same virtuosic way, Marvel draws parallels between the tiny world of the Ant-Man and our ordinary. This is the highlight of the picture, where from a daily routine, such as the running water in the bathroom, the movement of insects, there is a really exciting show that does not get bored, at least because of its novelty and uniqueness. Ants who are a friendly team, attract a lot of attention, manifesting themselves from different sides, and to discover and discover something new and amazing in its own way is always pleasant.
Without opposition and struggle, the whole picture does not lining up, so you need an opponent, who is a pupil of Hank Pym - Darren Kross, nicknamed the Yellow Hornet. And yet, it is worth noting that in the picture of Peyton Reed there are no strictly negative characters, there are only people who have lost their way. As a matter of fact, the Cross is the same, and its motives are clear and common, as well as Lang, Pim and others. If the ""Man-Ant"" and stands out with some ingenuity, then only by that small world, and as to the decoupling of the plot and the characters - they are submitted in the most elementary and uncomplicated manner. Be that as it may, this does not affect the film, which, in addition to its wittyness, wins and due to a good actor's presentation. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, together with their characters perfectly in harmony with each other, do not forget Michael Penny, with his funny character and funny gang, which makes a significant proportion of humor, due to his absurdity and absurdity.If you reproach the ""Person-ant"", then only for the accelerated rhythm of the narrative, leaving in the end a feeling of unfinishedness and haste. Shortened actions and incompletely developed relationships experience the same sense of conciseness as the ""Altron era"", but in this case, based on the above aspect, Peyton Read's film turns out to be more advantageous, perhaps because of the lack of trickery and sophistication . In addition to the fantastic, interesting and without exaggeration of the exciting world, the theme of love and family drama is touched upon. Love between the parent and the child, family ties are not just superficial, or for the species, they occupy an important place in the picture, which also gives an impression of a small share of its dramatic and soulfulness. ""Person-ant"" can be safely called the most real outlet, against the backdrop of great pathos and excessive heroism. The film is light, casual, pleasant, sometimes ironic and funny. He will certainly find his place among other Marvel projects, thereby expanding his cinematic universe even more."
" Lazy Writing
",-0.3612,0.9195,2018-06-11 00:00:00,7,"REVIEW - ANT MANYes I finally got around to watching the other insect inspired super hero movie who is a cross between Spiderman, Iron man and Batman.Spiderman because of his insect name,
Ironman because of his powered suit,
Batman because he is basically a normal gut just with a special suit.When this film first came out in 2015 I really didn't fancy it at all and when I saw the appearance of Ant Man in Infinity War it didn't impress me, so why did I watch this?Good question.Yes funny in places which Marvel or is it DC, (can't recall which is which because of the sheer number of super hero films we are being bombarded with at present) tend to learn towards rather than the dark, emotional and brooding films made by the other studio (whatever it is called).Watching the film, honestly I just thought it was lazy writing, giving the clue about shrinking into nothingness so early in the film and how our anti-hero (hey is that where the name 'ant man' came from) managed to escape this extra small dimension.Simple to watch and follow, some excellent comedy pieces by the 3 stooges but just (as I predicted) didn't hit home for me personally, but was an enjoyable watch none the kless.One thing that really cpnfirmed the lazy writing was with the film is the fact that the inventor of the 'Yellow Suit' (as I said lazy writing), was told by Michael Douglas that he was experiencing mental issues due to using the yellow suit, how? he had only just created the zero particle to power or size down the suit as tested on the lambs, so how could he have used the yellow suit previously to become so mentally unstable to sell to Hydra?Lazy writing.Personally for me the highlights of the film were Thomas The Tank Engine and the Tank!Rating 7 out of 10"

Following the previous event in Age of Ultron, Ant Man dives into the other great minds in the world and the possible small dilemmas created by this privately owned tech and corrupt corporations. Peyton Reed directs this movie beautifully with its fantastic cinematography and great direction with the combination of CGI and practical effects making this movie feel as real as possible with its direction. Sadly in my opinion I would've liked to have legendary director and writer, who created this script for Ant Man, Edgar Wright, to direct this film instead. Reed does a good job with what he was handed and balances everything very smoothly. The script is amazingly written with its tight dialogue and hilarious scenes between various characters, and of course Michael Pena being Michael Pena with his amazing execution and flawless acting. The dialogue feels so fluent I compare it to Iron Man and The Winter Soldiers with the feel of them to this. At some points I forget I'm watching a film and feel like I'm on set myself watching magic get made. And sadly with the writing there are some plot holes with the physics of the shrinking and growing and the 'power' behind some things. Acting overall is flawless. Corey Stoll may be my only pick for a possible miscasting. Up until the final act I didn't feel the impact of his character as an antagonist until that part. I felt more of him being a crazy scientist type of approach. He did fantastic with the script he was handed and he is a great actor but his casting for it to me just didn't fit it for me. Bobby Cannavale I thought was more of an antagonist than him with his sternness and hatred towards Rudd's character for his past actions and even future ones too. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lilly though all fit their roles perfectly and give this movie character and dimensions too with their hilarious yet serious tones throughout. And this movie made me forget how great of a comic Douglas is. Overall this film is very enjoyable and entertaining throughout and has some very memorable scenes, Retrieving a thing from a place with a fan favorite character. With some physics issues and a possible miscasting in my opinion, this movie isn't flawless but it'll get you laughing enough to possibly forget about them.Ant Man gets an 8/10"

",0.7351,0.9479,2018-04-05 00:00:00,6,"This was good, entertaining, would have been great to see in the theatre with the spc effects, kids will like this one. Its a superhero origin story following Paul Rudd as a con artist who gets a shot at redemption when his mentor (Michael Douglas) asks him to don a super-powered suit that shrinks him down to miniscule size, gives him superhuman strength and the ability to control an army of ants. We watch him learn to use the suit, assorted comical training scenes and fight off villains seeking to steal the invention.I liked Michael Douglas as the professor and the girl from Lost Evangeline Lilly. I thought Paul Rudd would have been funnier. Some holes in the story, although probably only applying to people like me who don't follow the universe ... not even holes really just questions... when he first breaks into Michael Douglas' house how can he scale the wall so easily? He's a hacker not a burglar right? What is the deal with Anthony Mackie swooping in, what's his story? Anyways, I liked the scenes where Rudd is shrunk down running in the grass, in the ant hills, liked his relationship with the ants in general ""Antony"" . The bad guy was ok, kinda your stereotypical antagonist I recognized him from that FX vampire show The Strain (Corey Stoll)"
" Though its not the best Marvel movie but excellent introduction to Antman
",0.4939,0.9586,2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"I would be honest Ant-Man isn't the best Marvel movie up to date but it was still amusing to watch since it had a lot of funny and memorable characters like the thugs (Scott's buddies) and that weird bunny (Tom Kenny). Paul Rudd,Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll were all pretty good as their characters.The best scene out of the whole movie is probably Falcon's cameo when Antman tries to escape S.H.I.E.L.D but Falcon blocks him and he has to fight him to get past him. Also the last fight scene with Yellowjacket was awesome and when he enters the microverse. However the post credits were useful since we get a sneak peak of Wasp's costume and Hope Pym would become the next Wasp which I am looking forward to in the upcoming Ant-Man and Wasp. Also one of the post credits does lead into Civil War since we see Sam and Steve visit Bucky.Overall good movie but not the best."

After a robbery that did not go as he expected our hero earned only a super-suit that has the ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength. Using that super-suit understood that he has to overcome not only his family problems but also much more for humanity. In order to do so, he has to embrace his inner hero and earn the trust of his mentor.I liked this movie because it was something different from all the other Marvel movies, it was like I was watching a movie inside a microscope sometimes and I have to admit that it was fascinating. I also liked the interpretations of Paul Rudd who played as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Michael Douglas who played as Dr. Hank Pym and Evangeline Lilly who played as Hope van Dyne. Michael Peña who played as Scott Lang's friend named Luis was once more hilarious as the comic relief character and Corey Stoll who played Darren Cross / Yellowjacket made a decent interpretation. The direction which was made by Peyton Reed was amazing and I believe that's the most important reason why this movie was so good.Finally, I have to say that ""Ant-Man"" is a very good movie for its kind and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it since it's very interesting, with a well-written plot, some twists that will increase your interest about the movie and you are going to enjoy it very much."
" Ant-Man Review
",0.0,0.9976,2018-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Ant-Man is a film directed by Peyton Reed. Back in 2015, when I saw the trailers for the film I was quite excited for the film. But not knowing much about the character I still had doubts. But I had a blast watching the film. Three years later as the sequel to this film is approaching, I felt it was the perfect time to review this film.Plot: Hank Pym, a former Ant-Man mentors Scott Lang to take his place and help him with a heist.Story and direction: Knowing that Edgar Wright would have directed the film, I felt the film would be quite different from what we have got as of today. But this film is not bad. It's quite entertaining and good. Thank God, the studio retained Edgar Wright as the writer for this film. The characters except for some instantly attract you. The jokes also don't seem out of place. They feel natural to the story. The human element of emotions is quite well balanced in this film. Considering the budget was kept lower the what MCU invests in other films, I felt the VFX was at par to the previous ventures. Never for a moment I felt I was seeing CGI. Kudos to the VFX team. But as with positives, do come certain negatives. I felt as a villain Darren Cross didn't appeal to me. He was very lousy and awkward. Also there is a scene post the epic battle that was a bit over-melodramatic. And then the editing regarding some action scenes. This is where Edgar Wright would have succeeded. The editing is quite choppy which is very cringe-worthy which makes some action sequences less enjoyable.Performances: It will be very hard for me to imagine Ant-Man without Paul Rudd. I loved him and he embraced his character so nicely. Evangeline Lily was great too. Micheal Douglas was awesome. The pain, anger, sorrow he carried all those emotions with so ease. Micheal Pena was easily my favorite character each time he opens his mouth, I was bursting with laughter. T.I. and David Dastmalchian as provided great support to Rudd's character. Corey Stroll was very unimpressive. I couldn't connect with him for even one scene. Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer and Abby Forston were good. It was good to see Marvel Alum gracing this film with their presence. And finally Stan Lee. Although he comes only for about 10 seconds I always will love him.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Scott and Hope have a pep talk and Scott finally learns how to control the ants. This scene was where you could feel the strong bond between Scott and Cassie. This is why this scene resonated with me the most.Verdict: Although it misses on a few points, I do feel for an origin story it did quite a decent job. Can't wait for this character's appearance in Infinity War and also the upcoming sequel to Ant-Man.I am going with an 8/10."
" True Neutral

The story isn't bad but it isn't good, The comedy is alright, It's original but just passingly so, and Everyone's performance meets expectations. This movie isn't a waste of time but you could also be watching a better movie. Even if your dead set on watching a Marvel movie there are much better MCU movies out there.I didn't have expectations for this movie so i still had a good time watching it, I was never bored but I was also never fully invested.Ant-Man is a movie that is mediocre in essence"
" Watchable, Not Much More
",0.0,0.8746,2018-02-10 00:00:00,5,"I did not have high expectations for this movie, I certainly wasn't to excited or I would have found a way to see it sooner than two years after it came out. Usually low expectations make it easier to like a movie, it is much easier to meet or exceed low expectations than high ones.I don't need non stop action a plot with huge implications, save the world, huge revenge motive, or whatever, to like a movie. In fact I often like what I call ""small movies"" with fewer special effects or huge cultural significance or whatever, but just have a good story to tell and some interesting characters. Ant man was an interesting character in the comic books, but I am certainly not a fanboy who is going to criticize the movie for some minor detail differences from the source material, it just wasn't translated well to the big screen like Thor, The Hulk, or Iron Man. My problem with the movie is that it didn't really succeed as a comic book movie with bigger than life stories, villain and action, and it was pretty boring as a plot and character based movie as well. I don't even mind cliched and formulaic if well done, this one is cliched and formulaic, but it is not well done. The five stars I gave it are probably a little generous."
" Unfortunately standard, with hints of brilliance.
",0.3612,0.9954,2018-02-01 00:00:00,6,"This review was previously posted on my blog, so sorry if bits don't make sense on another site! Recently, I've been watching the MCU films again. This is mostly due to the run-up to Avengers 3. I haven't felt the need to do reviews for most of them, but since my last post was semi-related to this film, I thought I might as well review it.As mentioned in my previous post, Edgar Wright was briefly involved in this film. As a fan of his work, this naturally elevates the film for me. While I can't know exactly what the director was involved with, you can still clearly see his fingerprints on the finished product. The editing is also brilliant at times, keeping the pacing of the film quick. A great soundtrack is present, and some comedy moments actually work, unlike my usual experience with recent Marvel movies. Unfortunately, the OST is a disappointment. This seems to be a frequent problem with most Marvel films. Can you, dear reader, remember an original song from a Marvel film? The only one people seem to be consistent with is the Avengers theme, which is rather odd; you have a cast of such varied and unique characters, and the music could really reflect that. Instead, songs feel like they could be taken from one film and added to another, and nobody would notice a difference.The cinematography is decent enough. There's rarely anything mind-blowing. Most of the highlights come from various jokes relating to the ever-changing size of the protagonist. Sharp cuts to reveal how mediocre the events occurring actually are happen frequently, and almost always to great effect.The dialogue was middling. The film falls into a painful trap, where the mentor character dumps a full scene of exposition onto our uneducated protagonist. It's rather frustrating given the fact that most viewers have already pieced the plot together. We don't need a recap. Also, there's various moments where lines are clumsily delivered. I don't know it's that's due to the actors or the writers, but regardless, parts simply don't work.The actors in this film are also interesting. There's very few poor performances, but at the same time, the writing can often let people down. Evangeline Lily is probably the most consistent of the performers, and Corey Stoll (ignoring the dodgy dialogue and poor writing) is perfectly fine as our antagonist.Also, rather oddly, the film seems to slip between originality and cliches rather easily. Ant-Man relishes in the standard scenes of a 'shrunken person' film, with small things being scarier, almost being stepped on and apocalyptic baths all being present. At the same time, however, moments are peculiarly mature. The protagonist isn't much of a hero. He's a convicted criminal who's just gotten out of jail. His partner has separated from him, and found a new lover, who is now acting as the father figure for their child. When I first watched the film, I expected it to end with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd)'s wife realising she really loves our protagonist, and has done all along. They'd get back together, and Scott would get full custody of his child again etc. Instead, it takes a far more mature route, and Scott finds a romantic interest of his own, while still remaining on good terms with his previous partner and her new lover.Typically, the film has quite a few random issues. There's a jarring absence of blood, despite characters being shot. There's also moments where it's clear we're meant to be feeling some sort of emotion (and perhaps I'm just a sociopath) but I felt little to nothing at the 'sad moments'. Also, the villain is simply awful. Again, however, this is annoyingly common with Marvel movies. Still, was a villainous Jeff Bezos the best they had to offer?The film is ultimately bland, but perfectly serviceable. It's an incredibly average Marvel movie, with depressing glimpses of real inspiration. I'll give it a 6/10. If you're a Marvel fan who's yet to watch it, and are curious as to how important it is to the overarching MCU plot, I imagine you can skip it. The next film in the series, Captain America: Civil War does feature elements of this film, but it's not really mandatory viewing. Still, if you have the time, there are worse ways to spend it."
" True movie craft, superb !
",0.8016,0.9909,2018-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Superb movie and great fun. Despite usual expectations about movies based on comics stories this one surprised me with it;s superb screenplay ( with Theme ), extraordinary casting ( if there would be Oscar for casting it should be nominated), superb acting, great effects, cinematography, editing, musicc score every element of the filmmaking craft deserves it's mention. You really want to watch this cast as there is unspeakeable pleasure to see all the main heroes ( Michael Douglasi his late years, lovely ! ) surrounded by team of colourful helpers.
You will not be be dissapointed and I'm waiting to see continuation."
" Good Superhero flick!
",0.4926,0.9648,2018-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly and Corey Stoll star in this 2015 action film based on the Marvel Comics. Rudd (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) plays 
Scott Lang, a thief who is down on his luck and wants to visit his daughter.
Soon, he steals a scientific suit that can shrink a person to a ant's size and learns he's been chosen to help it's creator, Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas).
Pym takes Lang under his wing, teaching him the capabilities of the suit and
to communicate with ants. Lilly plays Pym's daughter, Hope van Dyne and 
Stoll plays Darren Cross, a corrupt, business protégé of Pym who becomes Yellowjacket. This is a good superhero flick, Rudd is great in it and there's neat effects. I recommend this."
" Light and easy fun and action
",0.7351,0.9983,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Another month, another Marvel film! (Well, it's actually been two months since 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'). And although it may make me sound like a fanboy, I'm still not sick of them - especially when they're still as fun as 'Ant-Man'! Definitely not one of the bigger superheroes (no pun intended), but Ant-Man and Wasp were original Avengers in the 1960's comics and have always been integral to the Marvel universe. The film does well by including the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym (Douglas, holding up well for a 70-year-old) and tying him in with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Howard Stark, as well as showing some of the Wasp. The film also sets up Ant-Man's involvement in future 'Avengers'/'Captain America' films by having the Falcon (Mackie) involved too.Brought to you by the director of 'Bring It On' & 'The Break-Up', it's surprising it's not a weak rom-com! Reed does an OK job, but it's hard not to imagine what Edgar Wright, the original director (he still gets a writing credit) - famous for 'Shaun of the Dead' & 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' - would have done with it. That's not to say it lacks imagination or humour - as shown by the tank and the Thomas the Tank Engine scenes - but just that it at times feels a little pedestrian. I guess the PG (and not M) rating also contributes to this.The story is pretty simple, as is fitting a non-super-powered/non-Mutant hero - Scott Lang (Rudd) is a burglar (not a ""robber""!) who is trying to do right so he can be in his daughters' life again. Luckily, Pym and his daughter, Hope (Lilly) come along and give him the opportunity to wear the Ant-Man suit, which has the ability to shrink, thanks to the ""Pym Particle"". The film is fast and fun, with Rudd a great choice for the lead role, with his charm and humour (helped by one of the writers being Adam McKay, best known for 'Step Brothers' & 'Anchorman'). There's some 'seriousness' with Cross (Stoll) as the villain, but it is all very fast-paced and the stakes never seem too high. This won't be anyone's favourite Marvel movie, but it's certainly not a bad one either."
" Not bad at all, but could have been better
",0.698,0.8453,2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Listen...this was a superhero movie that knew just enough to laugh at itself and have fun. Bonus points? Absolutely. But there's a point where self satire is not quite enough. Michael Pena and Paul Rudd made this thing work. But I would have loved just a WEE bit less cliche. I'm not sure what I want from a superhero movie anymore, but it is slightly more than this."

" better than it seems
",0.4404,0.998,2017-12-03 00:00:00,5,"Expectations were low with this one and the movie takes full advantage of it. So many years mastering the ""hero's journey"" plot give us movies like this one. An unorthodox hero whose story needed comedy, and it has it, but without losing its dignity or getting cynical. THE MOVIE HAS WHAT IT NEEDS IN THE RIGHT MOMENTS IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT, without taking itself too seriously nor too lightly. The comedy works, I laughed a lot, but the dramatic bits are just as efficient, and the tragedy of going sub-atomic adds something unique to the family drama and this particular hero's challenge. The adequate shorter running time shows the studio intentions were more humble this time. It is just a nice entertaining movie, nothing more, nothing less, and it accomplishes its purpose brilliantly. Special mention to EVANGELINE LILLY, whose lack of faith in the training scenes is hilarious. A character well portrayed and well written, brilliant transition from hate to love in just a handful of scenes. Special mention as well to MICHAEL PEÑA, the comic relief. His rambling explanations are a great, original idea perfectly executed. The fact that this movie is better than The Age of Ultron proves that studios should relax, keep it simple, stop over-thinking and just make entertaining thoughtful movies, which they are more than capable of doing."
" The world's smallest superhero!
",0.0,0.9972,2017-11-27 00:00:00,8,"After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement they don't know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit's owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn't interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won't be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed 'Yellowjacket' suit.Not being a comic reader I wasn't familiar with Ant-Man before this film came out but when heard about it I thought the premise sounded rather fun and so it is. There are some humorous moments, mostly provided by Scott's criminal friends; these are fun and don't detract from the story. Scott/Ant-Man is a good protagonist as he isn't a typical superhero; he has no natural superpowers and the technology he uses wasn't invented by himself. Paul Rudd does a fine job in the role and is ably supported by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as Dr Pym and Hope. Corey Stoll is suitably menacing as Cross and Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian are fun as Scott's criminal friends. The special effects are very impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and accept that Ant-Man can change size and interact with actual ants. I liked the fact that while it is made clear that this film takes place in the same reality as other Marvell superhero films it doesn't guest star any other well-known superheroes just one less well known one in a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates an Avengers facility to steal a needed piece of equipment. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the superhero genre; it is lots of fun and has plenty of exciting moments."
" I'm late to the party! Very enjoyable, great cast and special effects are mind-blowing

This very much upsets his relationship with his young daughter, Madison, who still adores her biological dad. Nevertheless, she also loves her new stepdad (Bobby Cannavale), a policeman, and her mother (Judy Greer) and lives happily with them. One day, astonishingly, Scott receives information that his sentence is commuted. But, there are strings. A famous scientist, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has requested his services in a serious heist. Pym, you see, has invented a special suit, Ant-man, which allows the wearer to shrink to various sizes, mostly that of an ant. But, an unscrupulous underling, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who Pym fired, is also brilliant and has perfected the technology himself with knowledge gained from his former boss. Pym is a good guy while Cross has no problems selling his invention to the evildoers of the world, for a high, high price. Therefore, Scott is needed to shrink down and steal the parts that make Cross' operations work. It's dangerous. Meanwhile, Scott is also distracted by Pym's lovely scientist offspring (Evangeline Lilly), who has been secretly working against Cross. Can Scott pull this risky mission off and will he ever see his daughter again? This highly entertaining film has a, first, a strong cast. Rudd has his comedic ""nice guy with baggage"" role down pat while Douglas is very fine in his secondary part. Lilly, Cross, Cannavale and the rest are also quite nice. Especially funny is the trio of ex-cons who aid Scott in his new life. The script and direction are strong, too. Above all else, the special effects are mind-blowing, with journeys back and forth between the natural world and the microscopic. What a treat for the eyes! In short, these Ant-ics are not to be missed!"
" Ant Man is a beautiful, wonderfully made visually spectacular movie with stunning visuals and entertaining humour.

Ant Man is a small superhero delight. Marvel has done it once again. Ant Man is a movie about a small superhero but it is definitely a very big movie in terms of entertainment, humour and laughs, awesome character development, solid cast performances, awesome action scenes and an interesting story line. The direction of Peyton Reed is well crafted. The movie looks visually stylish and some photo realistic visuals are perfectly created. CGI, VFX are also good and looks realistic. The movie also looks good in terms of 3D, the 3D aspect of the movie is great. 3D scenes are handled very excellently and some scenes of small Ant Man in 3D are best. Also, Special Mention to the Excellent Screenplay and Story by: Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd.The performances are great. Especially the performances of Main Characters are very well performed. Paul Rudd has done a fantastic job as the character of Ant Man. Evangeline Lilly as the character of Hope Van Dyne is brilliant and Michael Douglas has done a superb job in portraying the character of Hank Pym with his incredible talent and excellency. But best thing of the movie is Michael Peña and his very awesome amazing super fantastic performance in the terms of humour and as a supporting character. He is one of the many best thing in the movie. His humour comic timing is excellent and feels very realistic.Ant Man has some flaws and issues also.The major flaw of the movie is a weak villain- the main negative character. The main villain character of the movie that is Yellowjacket is underdeveloped character and feels to be very rushed off. Corey Stoll as the main villain character of Yellowjacket is OK but not very impressive and his character feels very under utilized. There are also some underwhelming unnecessary characters which are not properly explored and they feel just like some plot devices to the story. Some scenes and certain sub plots are not properly structured.On a special note: Stay for mid and post credit scenes. They are really awesome. And there are lots and tons of references to past and future Marvel Shared Cinematic Universe Movies–through out the Ant Man movie.

" Light, Easy & Silly
",0.4588,0.9531,2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This time Marvel went small in concept and of course big with CGI effects. I was unaware that Ant-Man was a comic book character until this movie came out. The high level plot is a wise old scientist and his underling grapple with the moral uses of a shrinking suit and person technology. When the suit technology falls into the wrong hands, a seemingly regular Joe gets recruited to steal it back. Throw in a father-daughter relationship conundrum and the ubiquitous shout out to Iron Man (that guy seems to be referenced in all Marvel movies) and those are the shallow plot points that are the bases for the special effect. Effects that are really good. Lots of clever shrinkage scenarios around kids toys and other everyday happenings. Turn off your brain and watch this movie for the fun effects, light humor, silly tone and to see if Ant-Man will save the day."
" Should have been better
",0.4404,0.9926,2017-10-14 00:00:00,5,"Ant-Man promises much but doesn't deliver. Probably the weakest link of every Marvel movie ever made... It depends too much on special effects and there isn't the wit we are used to in other Marvel movies. A likable next door neighbor kind of guy that is a hero in disguise is a recipe that has been delivering for some time but the special 'X factor' we look forward to in a hero just isn't there. And I'm not blaming the actor's performance, I'm blaming the poor writing. Too much time was spent around a computer making sure the special effects were spot on but not that much time was spent writing a believable story that every fan would like to watch.5 out of 10. This is a movie to forget by Marvel. Apparently there will be a sequel, I just hope they improve what they have done here, as the fans deserve it."

The movie also has some comic relief, forced at times, but still good enough to appreciate the humor. The acting was pretty good with just the right balance of drama and humor; I especially liked the subplot regarding the relationship between Dr. Pym and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly).There is also plenty of spectacular special effects to highlight the tension in the plot.

" Works a treat as a light-hearted effects blockbuster
",0.765,0.977,2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"ANT-MAN is another light and breezy Marvel superhero movie conceived as a stand-alone introductory piece. The story is about a down-on-his-luck thief who ends up stealing a body suit that has the power to miniaturise him instantly. He then uses said suit to go on a heist to retrieve some important technology from a maniac. The film is set in the same universe as the Avengers films and contains some clumsily shoehorned-in references to the franchise.It's a simple enough conceit, but one which zings with humour and features endlessly great CGI action sequences which really push the boundaries and show off techniques and effects that haven't been done before. It was a lot of fun seeing ants playing the good guys in a similar way to HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The heist plot is nothing special but there's enough ensemble acting and humour to see it through. I wasn't particularly interested in Paul Rudd's hero, but Michael Douglas gives reliable support and Corey Stoll's bad guy is memorably nasty. For a light-hearted effects blockbuster, ANT-MAN works a treat."

The plot is sorta strange, but the dry humor sneaks up on you, and you find yourself laughing at the quick one liners.Michael Douglas was outstanding as the eccentric, yet not too eccentric scientist, who discovered a way to communicate with ants, and invents a neat super suit that shrinks someone down to ant size, while giving them super strength as well...I know, the concept is out there, but once you get into the story it definitely grabs you completely...Rudd is the ex-con who steals the super suit, finding out later that the mad scientist planned for him to, heh heh...The story is weird, the acting top notch, and Antman will give you some seriously funny entertainment..."

" Baskin Robins ALWAYS Find out
",0.0,0.9908,2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"'ANT-MAN' was directed by Peyton Reed, should have been directed by Edgar Wright and stars Paul Rudd, Corey Stroll and Michael Douglas.​ Decades ago, Hank Pym(Michael Douglas) made the Pym Particle, a special formula that could shrink a human being to the size of an insect. He kept his research a secret for many years but when his old protégé is closing in on the formula, Pym employs Scott Lang(Paul Rudd), an ex-convict and thief to don his suit and steal the formula from his protégé before it's too late.Damn. I don't wanna work in Baskin Robins now man... I don't need them seeing my life. Weird product placement(I guess?) aside, Ant- Man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the MCU and is a refreshing change of pace from what we're used to. Instead of being a standard Action movie, Ant-Man has evolved into a heist movie and takes the leap perfectly. The heist element(a product of Wright's genius I am sure) made the movie infinitely better than it should have been. I've always liked Paul Rudd, he seems like a nice guy, but I've never truly seen him shine before this movie. He pulls of Lang perfectly and I can definitely see this getting him more roles. Michael Douglas supports Rudd and does his role exceptionally well as Hank Pym. His dry tone and sometimes sarcastic mannerisms made him a perfect mentor for Scott and made him a memorable character. My main complaint is with the villain but I will address that in greater detail further along.The story for this movie is alright. What makes it entertaining is the heist element and the heist alone. Without the heist, this movie would have been flat and have blurred in with the remained of the MCU for me. One thing I will say has been lacking from many MCU movies is powerful and impactful moments. Not saying they never happened but this movie tried to do some properly. Alas, they failed at this. They make a joke midway through a powerful scene and acknowledging it mid scene doesn't make the fact you ruined a good scene go away, it just puts it to the forefront of most people's minds. Not to say it was a bad joke, I just think they should have left it alone. Straight before or straight after - I don't care. Just don't ruin a scene that was working which I cheap gag for laughs.As previously stated, Rudd and Douglas do exceptionally well so I won't comment any further. Also stated previously was my dislike of the villain, Darren Cross. Corey did a perfectly passable performance as Cross but where he falters is how one note he is. The character is just a mad, evil genius with no layers or interesting motivations. He was very dull and is this movie's main downfall. I don't know much about the Ant-Man comics but, if he is like this in the comics, they should have chosen another villain that had more meaning. Another weakness of the movie for me was Evangaline Lily as Hope. I didn't buy her performance, her character but most importantly I didn't buy the romance between her and Scott. It just felt unnatural and wasn't earned. They could have made a fun, romantic-comedy esc side-plot and even poked fun at that in the movie but they just go for a bland montage that doesn't effectively convey the character's emotions and feeling. Michael Pena's Luis could have come across as an annoying time waster but didn't. It's very hard to make the comic relief work in a movie and I think Pena did it brilliantly.This is a technically proficient movie and it looks fine but I bet it would be a technical Marvel if Feige kept his grubby paws of Wright's neck and eventually fired him. The effects for this movie are marvellous. I believe that they used miniatures for major segments in this movie. That is not only inventive but also a very refreshing change in pace from the standard CGI fest. Not to say there is no CGI but when it's used it's used very well.This movie made me laugh, the heist was interesting, the action was top notch. If I had to poke one other flaw it would be a certain cameo towards the middle which I believe should have been cut from the movie entirely. Aside from these flaws, Ant-Man is a very fun ride and I definitely want to know where these films go. I'll rate it 8 Weird A$$ Looking Dogs out of 10."
" Such a great movie
",0.6249,0.9936,2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie. It isn't my favourite Marvel movie, but I do love Paul Rudd, so it made me the movie instantly a good one in my book.In this movie, a (trying to be) former-thief, Scott, is recruited by a scientist to pull of a heist. He is armed with a super-suit which has the ability to shrink to the size of an ant, but become super- strong at the same time. Scott must embrace his inner hero to help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, in this heist, which will save the world.Best part of this episode: Everything.Worst part of this episode: Darren Cross. Ugh.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great."
" Marvel's Best Movie To Date - A Miniature Marvel
",0.7906,0.9966,2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"After watching Marvel's Avengers - Age Of Ultron and Guardians Of The Galaxy, of which I was a little less than bowled over by, I was hesitant to watch this film. I knew this had the potential to be a brilliantly visual masterpiece - which it was. It was also a well thought out story filled with interesting characters and well-shot scenes, both innovative and ingenious.Marvel needed this film to breathe fresh air into its universe.Though it's not the Hank Pym Ant-Man that I remembered out of the back pages of the Hulk comic of my youth it still held up to the comic's feel and atmosphere.Writers, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd create a good and solid story around this Ant-Man's origin and the threat which the Ant-Man tech could produce. It could also be that the personality of Scott Lang (Ant-Man) is so steadfast and credible is that Paul Rudd who portrayed him also co-wrote the screenplay. I've never been a great fan of Rudd's as I've found his previous work could either hit (Role- Models) or miss (Admission) - this is definitely some of his better work, and he adds quite a bit to the character and atmosphere of the movie.Even the rest of the cast do a brilliant job with their characters. I especially liked Bobby Cannavale as Paxton, Scott's ex-wife's new man... and cop! He adds a nice dynamic to Scott's personal life as he loves Maggie and Cassie (Scott's ex and daughter) and tries to give Scott the benefit of the doubt, even though he's an ex-con. Then there's Michael Pena who is outstanding as Luis. It was nice to see Evangelina Lilly in a decent roll and she carried off the role of Pym's estranged daughter, Hope Van Dyne, admirably. She should make a brilliant Wasp in the upcoming sequel.The other star of this film is the Director, Peyton Reed, who seems to effortlessly weave CGI and reality together. The scenes where Scott pops from miniature to actual size while fighting could have been so bad but thanks to the direction and the animators they're believable and very effective. Reed is also good at switching pace to give his audience a roller-coaster ride of a movie.The special effects are superb and seamless - respect due to all involved. And it is truly wonderful that Thomas the Tank Engine is finally breaking into the big time.This film is a must for all comic book and action movie lovers alike. If you've not hopped into the Marvel universe yet this is one hell of a good place to start... though it may make the rest of the films look a little pale by comparison. This is one film I will watch again... and again..."
" More relaxed than others, very entertaining
",0.7708,0.9971,2017-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Ant-Man? Marvel isn't making movies about the actually interesting heroes, but we get a movie about Ant-Man? I was very suspicious when Ant-Man was announced. Who actually gave a chicken-s@#t about Ant-Man? However my mind changed once I learned Edgar Wright was one of the writers. I've liked his style so, you know, even if Ant-Man had been total rubbish, at least there was some skillful writing - not just from Wright.The most distinct thing about Ant-Man is how much simpler it is compared to the massive Avengers franchise. The story is simple, mostly revolving around a heist instead of some huge, epic fight that will cause millions of dollars worth of damage to the cities. It's simple, yet still interesting enough to watch. Another special thing about Ant-Man is how much more relaxed it seems. There's no giant need to make it super serious and stuff a lot of philosophical pondering in there, which usually does go to total waste when it comes to superhero movies. Ant-Man is an action comedy, and it usually manages to make even the most important fights quite funny in rather easy ways. Ant-Man does a way better job at making the situation lighter than, say, Avengers: Age of Ultron, where they just zing kind of cheesy one-liners here and there to get cheap laughs from the audience. Could it be because writers of Avengers are working under this huge pressure and they can't really enjoy themselves, while reaction to Ant-Man being announced was pretty much ""Why the f@#k would you make this movie?""Of course there are annoyances, which are too common with any superhero movies, and they get recycled over and over again. There's that unnecessary romance, predictable structure, but what's most annoying to me is you can't really watch a Marvel movie unless you've seen like at least three others. I'd love to be able to watch Ant-Man as Ant-Man, because it's actually funny movie, but there's hint to movies I haven't seen, and I don't want to watch. This is the biggest problem with the franchise system - you can't just watch movies individually. Like sure I wouldn't watch Iron Man 3 without seeing the first two, but like this is the first Ant-Man movie and still I have to know so much? It's a buzzkill.All in all Ant-Man is a very entertaining movie, but it has the same flaws every superhero movie has. Thankfully though it's hilarious and way more relaxed than any other superhero movie I've seen - apart from Deadpool, of course."
" Tiny Iron-man, but still good.
",0.5927,0.9941,2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Finally I decided it is time to review the film ,which you can't tell the title with out chuckle a bit , because it seems so outrageous and silly and yet and yet the Marvel Studios still made a decent film out of it and bring one of the original Avengers on the big screen ,despite the lack of size ( ;)).So in the film we follow Scot Lang ,who is recruited by Hank Pim ,the original Ant- man in order to help him steal his plans of how to change a persons or things size. Add to the mix add some nice slap-stick , Corey Stoll as the antagonist and you have your movie ,which by all the marvel films so far I feel it as the most family friendly of them all, like the Home Alone or Honey I shrank the kids of the MCU. And that is by no means bad ,I actually believe it is good that MCU can make and films like that. Up to 2015 we had seen already ,WW2 film (First Avenger) ,Space Opera (Guardians of the Galaxy) , the technology genius (Iron Man) ,films about Gods (Thor) and not one but two big team ups (Avengers). In short ,yes the film feels like that has similarities with Iron-man but they are superficial at best. Also if you are inept in the comic history ,you know dear reader ,that Ant-man from the comics has the most mixed and controversial story from all the Avengers. So to watch a film about him ,been both faithful to the premise and in all honesty removing the parts which no-one want to see it was a pleasure and gave me quite a lot respect to the creating team.All in all if I have to compare the newest man with a power-suit with the original I would say that Ant-man is better than Iron-Man 2 and 3, but still far behind the first film. So buy or rent it and watch with the whole family."
" ""Why don't you just call The Avengers?""
",0.0,0.9889,2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I guess I owe Peyton Reed an apology. I wasn't entirely right in saying Ant-Man was going to be bad. In fact, I had a lot of fun with it. I loved how small-scale the movie was, and Paul Rudd was great here. His arc is predictable, sure, but he does a good job giving the character some personality where the script failed to do so. Rudd is a guy who I love to watch in movies, so seeing him get his ""big break"" here is personally awesome for me and honestly would have been even if the movie wasn't good.However, I had some serious issues with the movie. Now, whenever the film really honed in on the ""heist"" aspect of the story, it worked. But, the MCU references bring the film to a screeching halt. One scene in particular (spoiled by the ads, so I'll talk about it) involves the lead having to steal something for Pym, only to find out the base where this technology is at is actually an Avengers base. This leads to a completely unnecessary and out-of-place fight between Ant-Man and Falcon. Yeah, it was kind of cool, but man, forced doesn't even begin to describe how this scene felt. This is something that definitely wasn't in Edgar Wright's original script.Speaking of Wright, Peyton Reed does try to mimic Wright every so often, and I wish he hadn't. The montage scene early on with Michael Pena worked, but the fast cuts and other montages similar to what you'd see in Wright's films just don't. You really shouldn't try to imitate other directors, especially one as visually distinct as Wright. Thankfully, Reed doesn't fall back on his style often and has his own voice, even if it is more mainstream.As a whole, though, Ant-Man is a fun movie that is refreshingly small, but ultimately gets bogged down whenever it tries to tie itself to Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Which is a shame, especially knowing that with Wright at helm, it would have definitely been more of a standalone feature and it probably would have been even better."
" One of my all time favorite MARVEL superheros movies
",0.7603,0.9997,2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero. I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made. A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me.

" Iron Man is an awesome film
",0.6249,0.9963,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"No, you read the title correctly – this isn't a review of Robert Downey Jr's first outing as the man IN steel. This is a review of Paul Rudd's turn as the titular 'Ant-Man' – yet another entry in the – seemingly – never ending 'Marvel Cinematic Universe.' Basically, Marvel has a formula where you have (a) (conflicted) hero (b) incident giving him superpowers (c) nemesis who happens to be the sort of bad version of himself. Now, before any Marvel fans jump down my throat and point out that NUMEROUS superheroes follow this template – I know this. DC and various independent efforts have all done this, right back from their comic origins. However, no other franchise is this prominent and turns out one film so quickly after the next, making it hard to forget what's come only just a year or so before.'Ant-Man' follows Paul Rudd's character who's a down on his luck ex thief, freshly-released from prison, who gets more than he bargained for when he steals a top secret suit which allows him to shrink down to the size of an ant, along with all the benefits of super speed and strength which goes with it. Now, first of all many people wondered whether Rudd would pull this off. Typically, he's been known for his romantic comedies, rather than his action films (let alone leading man status). I'm pleased to say he did well. He brings a lot of humour to the role without making it an outright comedy, often poking fun at the genre, not to mention the general ludicrousness of being known as 'Ant-Man.' Besides, the typically forgettable villain that Marvel films seem to be known for (whenever Loki's not trying to take over the universe) we have Michael Douglas as the Obi-wan/mentor role to Rudd's fledgling superhero. I was delighted to see him back on the screen again as it seems like a long time since he's been at the forefront of the industry and he brings the charm he used to exhibit back in the nineties to the proceedings. Yes, there's a love interest in there, too and some 'comic relief' characters who you won't be able to remember their names once the credits have rolled.Then, once the cast is assembled, they proceed to go on what is effectively Marvel's take on a 'heist movie,' i.e. think 'Ocean's Eleven' but with more insects. Did I mention Ant-Man can also control ants? Well, he can. This leads to – in my opinion – is one of the film's only real let-downs – the special effects. Now, for ninety per cent of the film the effects are up there with what you'd come to expect from a big budget film. It's just sometimes the insects do look a little 'drawn on' after the footage has been filmed. I guess I should just forgive this on account of how unfeasible it would be to train an army of bugs to put in a convincing performance (although, saying that – didn't Disney do that in 'A Bug's Life?).So, 'Ant-Man' hardly reinvents the wheel in terms of cinema or its genre. However, its biggest flaw is also its strongpoint. It goes with the 'winning formula.' It certainly feels like a modern Marvel movie and, when you hold it up closely to others like 'Iron Man' and 'The Hulk,' you'll see that it copies them practically beat for beat. Normally, this would feel like a let-down, but when it copies something so good and just so happens to be such great fun in the process, I really can't bring myself to hate this film as much as I might have wanted to. Ant-Man will never be as big as Iron Man or Captain America, but this film's existence (and success!) proves that there is scope for the lesser-known heroes to also shine. Don't think too hard about this film, just break out the popcorn and enjoy. Oh, and apparently Ant-Man WILL return!"
" Superhero-movie without the edge
",0.0,0.9659,2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"Another of the Avenger heroes makes an appearance. Having seen the other Avenger movies I knew pretty much what to expect. A movie full of action mixed up with a humorous dialog and some classic comedy. And Ant-man was just that. A funny action packed spectacle. However, it doesn't really rise to the level of the other Avenger movies. I don't know what does it, it might be Ant-man's hero ability that is more comedy than action. Or the constant size-zapping that make most action scenes fragmented. Or that Ant-man's ability is not consistent within the movie. Oh, I know and have no problem with that the movie is unrealistic, it is in the genre. But that the Ant-man one moment is heavy enough to dent a car's roof but not the ants he is sitting on. A movie need to be true to itself.Well, it is fun. It is action packed. Paul Rudd does it well in a role unusual to him. But it is not at the level of the other movies that it is inevitably compared to."
" Disintegration!
",0.0,0.5382,2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"This is a heist movie and smaller in scale than most superhero films, which is why it works so well. The film is about a convict father who is unknowing recruited to become the next Ant-man in order to pull off a robbery and keep Ant-man technology out of the hands of the bad guys. The film does an excellent job of mixing comedy and action. The gem of the film is the final battle, it is one of the best fight scenes I have seen from hero films in a while, excluding the Civil War airport fight. However the film isn't perfect. The villain is underdeveloped. T.I. is in this film and his acting drags on you. The lady playing the future Wasp is a blank slate, nearly robotic. And some of the ant CGI is outright awful. But now I'm just nitpicking. This is a very rewatchable and I highly recommend it."
" Odd, but good
",0.4939,0.9856,2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Ant-man has a different tone and style to all the other Marvel films. It is surprisingly entertaining and has a marvelous balance between comedy, action, and drama. With an over-complicated plot that relies too much on coincidence, the believability is questionable at times. And like the other marvel superhero films, the villain has no character depth, and is very card-board. Rudd is the perfect choice for Ant-Man, and Douglas and Lilly were fine supporting roles. The movie had some cute and enjoyable tie-ins with the greater realm of Marvel, and has enough references and teases to be a true part of the Marvel universe without being overbearing or obvious to the point of cringe."
