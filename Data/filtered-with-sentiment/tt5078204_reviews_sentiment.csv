" Great movie !!!
",0.7163,0.9423,2021-04-03 00:00:00,9,Great movie.Good acting and a great story line.Omar Sy nails it as always.Good to see him play a serious role with the injection of his natural humour and screen presence felt throughout.Definite watch if you are a Sy can.
" Absolutely unrealistic film
",0.0,0.8656,2021-02-27 00:00:00,3,"I had pretty high expectations from this movie since a few friends recommended it to me, but it absolutely sucked. In the middle of the film it changes from a bad comedy to an even worse melodrama, but while the film is in it's melodrama phase it still thinks it's a comedy and tries to make you laugh while trying to make you cry. The film makes a complete joke out of everything, for example it's a running joke that the main character can't speak English while having lived in London or 8 years, am i supposed to find that funny? When at the end of the film they realised that there weren't any emotional moments in their ""melodrama"" they just decide to abruptly kill of one of the main characters. You can see that the movie is indeed a movie since none of the things that happen would actually happen in real life, for example the dad leaves his work in France behind for 8 years and then just suddenly comes back like nothing happened and just get his job back. One of the scenes did slightly make me laugh though and there was a good balance between visual storytelling, montages and just normal dialogue."
" It says comedy but im bawling my eyes out

" Watch if you wanna cry.

It is a sweet but sad movie at the same time, and I love the way it has a playful setting. I just loved it!"

",0.0,0.8012,2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Marvellous little film!
French film , but it is more than worth it , to do the effort reading the subtitles!!
If you like the character of the father in this film, watch also ""Les intouchables"" !"
" Overrated and disappointing
",-0.4939,0.2411,2020-02-15 00:00:00,3,"This movie is mainly using stereotypes and cliché, is predictable and tries to appeal to our emotions without any subtlety.
A loss of my time, I cannot believe such high ratings with so many voters."

" Making an impact
",0.0,0.9081,2019-11-30 00:00:00,9,"The movie has a slow start. But after about 20 minutes a true story comes alive. It is teaching us a few life lessons.
Enjoy the movie"
" Nice and sad
",-0.0772,0.8967,2019-03-17 00:00:00,8,I didn't like end. I expected to be comedy but this movie is great. Story is not so new but during watching there is a lots of surprise and it is worth of watching.
" Really fantastic

" A story about life
",0.0,0.9477,2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"What does it really mean to be a father? How can 20 euros change the life of a man. A beautiful and touching story about hardship, love, struggles, friendship - in one word: life. Omar Sy has became one of the greatest actors, who can diplay the deepest emotions on screen, just if it was real. A great one."

" A breath of fresh air
",0.3182,-0.0516,2018-12-12 00:00:00,10,"What more can I say. In this age of terrorists,serial killers, superheroes, self serving politicians and globalised corporations, it's wonderfully refreshing to watch a movie such as this. At this point words fail me. Just watch it, take in the messages of selflessness and then reflect on what you have yourself. A wonderful movie."
" Tomorrow everything starts
",0.0,0.9531,2018-10-18 00:00:00,10,"The film is entitled ""Demain tout commence"" in english is ""Tomorrow everything starts"".

I love this film because is very good."
" Feel good movie
",0.4404,-0.5431,2018-09-28 00:00:00,5,"I think the bad reviews are from people hoping for a realistic story. it's not, it's a comedy. Funny, calling for feelings, but aiming for the happy ending.
Problem, the ending is not so happy, and the story can be confusing. 
That's why i'll give 5 stars. But if you are looking for a nice comedy, the acting and the filming will get you what you need.SPOILERS
""Il est malade"" is said before the end, which is a misleading to the real twist. I dont know if it was on purpose but it's not ok to let a character say something and ignore the meaning of the scene to tell another story at the end.
END OF SPOILERS"
" Shaking plot, heartfelt interpretations
",0.4215,0.9879,2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Once I learnt that ""Two is a family"" was a remake of a Mexican film, I understood all the mixed feelings I had while watching it. It does have that forced happiness and joy that all Mexican telenovelas seem to have, in which people go from laughter at tears in one blink. But that's not the point here. The thing is: the movie goes everywhere. It should be about a man's redemption, regarding his reckless behavior and lying tendencies. Then I thought it should be about a mother returning to take away a loving daughter from her brave dad, and it became a court drama. But soon after it was about dad letting go of the girl, and in the final chapter it becomes something else. So I went to watch some of the original's scenes (I don't mean to be mean, but truth is I wouldn't find Eugenio Derbez, with that weak chin, a womanizer... it wouldn't convince me, latino or not latino). I wish it had a plot which was straightforward, because there's a big message in there, something that is always delicate and heartbreaking whenever you find it in art (literature, cinema). The message doesn't even get to you, because the main character never really redeems himself. However, some of the moment were truly tender and beautiful, both Omar and Gloria Colston completely steal the scene, and supporting actors like Clémence Poésy and Antoine Bertrand were very intense and solid as well, in their portraits. I just felt the direction was sometimes lost and the voice went shaking, I didn't find what was being delivered was pertinent or interesting at times (like the school scene with Sam being the new janitor at Gloria's school, or the scene in which Sam jumps off a 11th floor). Overall I felt the movie was too long, that story could've been beautifully packed, it had lots of potential, but I somehow feel it got lost behind all sparkles and fireworks, easy laughter and Omar's genuine talent to make us smile."
" Good remake of ""Instructions not included""
",0.4404,0.9274,2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Almost the exact copy of the 2013 movie, few scenes skipped but if you enjoyed ""Instructions not included"" with Eugenio Derbez, you will surely enjoy this one."
" A movie that can't decide its tone or subplots... so it goes for predictability.
",0.0,-0.9883,2018-09-04 00:00:00,3,"This is the kind of movie you would watch if you hate yourself. Based in a terrible piece of mexican cinematic excrement and with no original elements, this movie tells the tale of a party guy that is not afraid, his boss is able of kinda tolerate him that suddendly gets a kid abandoned by it's mother because she was confused. So he becomes accidentally a stunt double to raise her. The mother appears later to reclaim her, they get togheter for a time because the kid dies and everybody is stupidly happy ever after.The plot sounds absoltely dumb? The execution is even worse.The tone was lost all over the place. The movie tried to be drama / comedy / action / educational. Failed in every aspect. The drama was bland and had predictable outcomes. The comedy was so badly delivered it physically hurt. The action was scarce and I have no idea what it had to do with anything and the moral is so hamfisted it gave a masoquist an orgasm.The cinematography, the acting and the photography were good... so those were absolutely wasted, the music is stock, the dialog is unsatisfactory and the delivery is painfully boring.Do seriously not watch this. Nor should you watch the movie it is based on. I have no idea which is worse and I won't watch either of this abominations again"
" I'm mute!
",0.0,0.4191,2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Just fantastic and touchable. This can not be true, amazing and SY makes as always his roles flawless!"
" Terrible
",-0.4767,0.4019,2018-05-20 00:00:00,1,Cheap sentimentality like a soap opera. An offense to intelligence. Terrible.
" YES FRANCE!
",0.4574,0.9197,2018-04-26 00:00:00,8,"What a delight to watch a movie where the situation is reversed from one of the biggest clichés in American cinema. Black protagonist with better conditions for a child's creation where the mother, white, would be the problematic. This is rare in hollywood movies. Thank you France! Comedy-like drama with good actors and a simple text, but that makes us think about our responsibilities. Very beautiful movie!"
" Weak story with a lot of licorice
",-0.4404,0.986,2017-11-13 00:00:00,4,"If you want to see Omar Sy in another ""sweet"" childish story filled with good people and intentions, then go see this one. It is filled to the brim with sugar and does hardly reflect reality.I sometimes wonder: we don't like people that lie, right? So why do we like movies that lie? Because this movie is one big lie. It's a sweet bedtime story for children. I am not against people and situation that are optimistic, but this is just far-fetched. The acting is average at best, certain scenes are barely watchable due to the amount of sweetness involved and generally the story line goes from one unrealistic moment to another. Character development is virtually lacking and there's just one truly surprising moment in the narrative which basically saves the credibility of this movie. If you want to see a feel good movie, then perhaps this is not a bad choice. But objectively speaking, the movie scores below par on all important counts."
" Not too bad a remake
",0.431,0.8834,2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"This was made as a European version of the Mexican original. The original was released in 2013 and called ""No se aceptan devoluciones"" or ""Instructions Not Included"" and this one was released in 2016 and is called ""Demain tout commence"" or ""Two Is a Family"" Both are bilingual. This remake is pretty good but as with almost all remakes, not as good as the original. This version does skip past a few scenes and key story points but otherwise is almost scene for scene the same."
" Good movie but an uneven experience
",0.2382,0.9632,2017-07-21 00:00:00,7,"This is a dramedy, containing touching elements as well as funny ones, and most of it is carried off rather well. Omar Sy's acting is up to his part of over-strained and anxious single father, between this and ""Chocolat"" he's shown that he can be trusted with more serious stuff without problems. Most of the other actors (including the daughter) are equally up to their jobs, with the possible exception of Bertrand's ""Bernie"" (don't know if it's the actors', director's or writer's fault but that character was neither believable nor funny).Which brings us to the weakest point - the comedy aspects just don't work that well here, most gags are rather cheap laughs, some not very funny at all - the drama parts are more enjoyable. Recommended all the same!"
" Responsibility
",0.0,0.9251,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"For one there is the responsibility of making a good remake as it seems. While I was watching it, I was not aware of this being a remake. I'm going out on a limb here and will believe a fellow reviewer on IMDb when he says this is a Remake of a Mexican movie. So yes while Americans do like to Remake world movies (including French movies), the French do like to do so also.And why shouldn't they? Especially when you get a result like that. You probably have seen or at least heard of Omar Sy (if you watch this very close to the release that is, not like 50 years later) and he is a very likable guy. While his character has flaws, a new family situation changes everything. Now that isn't completely new, even Adam Sandler and The Rock have done similar movies, but this still feels sort of unique. And most important of all it is funny"
" moving and amusing
",0.3818,0.9278,2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"This is the typical well made comedy–drama, where the wise combination of funny and moving elements results in a good product, also thanks to the good acting performances. Omar Sy really feels his character and is certainly the pillar of strength of a sometimes weak screenplay, but still capable of arousing deep emotion. The (usual) bad Italian translation of the original title (Demain tout commence), with the addition of a useless subtitle, does not render the intention of a picture that wants to touch some delicate chords of human sensitivity, in a very simple and natural way, and manages to do that quite effectively."
" Above everything, a sweet drama full of EMOTION!
",0.5093,0.9884,2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"What brought me to see this movie was the fact that Omar Sy was on the cast, one of my favorites french actors. The fact that it was a comedy\drama also captured my attention because of the variety of emotions which are offered to us all the time, during the film.After watching the motion picture ""Demain tout commence"", I've reserved an extremely positive review for this topic! At the beginning Samuel is living a relaxed life always in parties and long nights, it is beautiful to see how much the man's life changed when he discovered he had a daughter, I will not give you spoilers about the rest but I advise you to watch it!In case you like movies full of good plays and INTENSITY till the end, you should see ""Demain tout commence""!!PS: I also really liked Gloria Colton play, she will surely have a great career!"
" Diagnosis: identity crisis
",-0.6249,0.7193,2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"Given the premise, the story that screams to be told here - a serial womanizer who never took an ounce of responsibility in his life suddenly loses everything and is faced with the challenge of raising a girl, who is a total stranger to him, in a foreign country, with no means at hand - is sadly left untold. Instead, the movie opts for introducing a wealthy, bearded plot device called Bernie, and we skip the first eight years of little Glorias upbringing in a colourful montage. What we get after that is a strange and tiresome cocktail, the base of which consists in a version of the worn-out 'liar revealed'-story, needless and lazily motivated (""I'm only lying because I want to make you happy""). Embedded in this are scenes reminding us of the impossibly ideal, always cheerful friendship between father and daughter, alternating with half-hearted attempts at drama, both elements effectively nullifying each others' effects. The outcome is a confusing movie that doesn't know its own identity. I could have perhaps forgiven it its flaws and watched it as a lighthearted comedy with some family drama components, if all the commotions in the second act would have simply been put to rest in the third, and that would have been the end of it. But, consistent with the movie's main issue, in the very last scene, a formerly entirely irrelevant subplot reemerges to – assisted by a whimsical, reflective montage of our family, once again united, frolicking in the sea and laughing into the camera – scream ""tragicomedy"" in our faces. One thing to hold in its favour are the performances of the two main actors. Sadly, the development of their characters is utterly neglected, not allowing the actors to really show what they can do."
" Remake of Mexican movie
",0.0,0.4065,2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"After 10 minutes I started getting this weird feeling I had seen the movie before. Impossible, as it just started screening in the cinemas. Scene after scene I was able to predict what would happen, until I remembered that I had seen a similar Spanish like movie a couple of years ago with exactly the same story. Unfortunately this has biased me and I cannot give an objective opinion of the movie. I was constantly annoyed by the fact that I knew what was going to happen. Let me try though.I like the story, I like the conundrum and I like the fact it touched my emotions. It is kind of a heartbreaking dilemma, which I believe the outcome has been portrayed quite realistically. I was not that fond of the acting though, none of the actors were really that trustworthy in their acting. I would consider the child to be the best actor in the movie. The music is average and the cinematography not that special either. Therefore, I would give this movie a 6,5, but since that is not possible, I will give it the benefit of the doubt: 7.0"
" Better than I thought it would be!
",0.4926,0.9843,2017-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Better than I thought it would be! I think that Omar Sy is one of the funniest and talented actors of France. Especially in Untouchable he's got a certain type of humor. In this flick he plays a father. At first I thought it would be a kids film only. But it's just an emotional film for everyone. Of course it's not a genius film but if you want to see a good rainy Sunday afternoon movie this is just for you :) The problem of this movie is the storytelling, first everything is good and then it gets worse and worse. There's also too less communication between the main characters. But the acting is good, also Gloria is really well played, I'd like to see her in other films too :) Good acting, a lot of emotions, 6 out of 10 stars."
" A totally unexpected Omar Sy
",0.0,0.9819,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I though I knew Omar Sy from his other work: ""Intouchables"", ""Nos jours heureux"", ""Chocolat"". But this is something else! Excellent performance! He's so into his character that it feels he isn't even acting, just being. The plot twist towards the end is a real surprise. You go on guessing the story line, but it goes to and fro a few times. Along the way, you're really rooting for more than one person! It's a tale of ""deserving"" versus "" rights"", feelings versus facts. Clémence Poésy did her part very well too and so did Antoine Bertrand, madly in love with his work, thinking very fast. The tempo and timing looked good, I did not feel its length of nearly 2 hours. All in all, a good movie, certainly worth watching, for men and women alike."
" Emotional Story, great acting
",0.6908,0.9304,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"First let me say this: I am not a fan of Omar Sy, nor his previous work in Intouchable... But I was amazed how realistic he brought his character to live in this movie. Im not an emotional person but towards the end of the movie I really had troubling holding the tears in because of the not logical rules of the court and our society.You really feel connected to a lot of the characters in the movie. There are some cheesy things that keeps coming up and suppose to be funny but after 2-3 times it's not really that funny anymore.Overall it's a great movie and definitely one you can watch with you girl/boyfriend or wife/husband!"
