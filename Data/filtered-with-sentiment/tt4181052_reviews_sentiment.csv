" Yet another clunker from Gervais
",0.0,0.4532,2021-03-26 00:00:00,4,"Ricky Gervais can be really hit and miss nowadays. From The Office to Extras, he was at top form and made consistently great stuff. His Live Stand-Up Comedies are still funny for the most part too. After that though, his track record varies as I wasn't a huge fan of Life's Too Short and found Derek pretty crappy, but After Life was kind of decent. Is he on a decline? Maybe? It's hard to say.With Special Correspondence, Ricky Gervais wrote and directed this for Netflix and unfortunately it's mostly a miss. Any small handful of jokes that worked are filled with lots of misses and the story gets weaker as it progresses, so it becomes kind of poor by the end. I'm also starting to think Gervais is only good at himself. I didn't buy he was a geek who liked comics and video games at all.Eric Bana and Vera Farmiga fare better in their performances, but it still can't save the weak writing which has big plot holes and could have been much better. That being said, it was a pretty easy watch and I've seen worse things from Netflix. I was kind of hoping this was going to be a comeback for Gervais, but sadly this is one of his very worst projects.4/10."

" Helps if you like Ricky Gervais
",0.6249,0.9879,2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"I came across this film today, November 2020, quite surprised that I had never heard of it before.
Firstly, I haven't always appreciated Ricky Gervais, and if I would have seen this film when it first came out, I may not have enjoyed it as much as I did. But having moved on from 'The office', (Something I will always love), Ricky's humour has changed somewhat over the years, becoming more serious leading to his latest creations of 'Afterlife'.
And although Afterlife is not a comedy as such, whilst special correspondents is, I found the humour in both ver similar. Not the slapstick, in your face style of 'The office', but a subtler humour which I have now grown to enjoy just as much.
So yes, I am glad I have only found this film this year. An unexpected find, no hype, just an enjoyable film full of Rickys brand of humour."
" Ricky Gervais should stick with stand-up.
",0.0,0.9915,2020-11-09 00:00:00,6,"Where to start? First of all, I love Ricky Gervais as a stand-up comedian, he's definitely one of my favorites in that genre, and I love him in series like The Office, so I was looking forward to see what he was capable of in a movie. It's a bit disappointing to be honest, not that it wasn't funny at all but it could clearly have been better. My opinion is that he should stick with stand-up comedy, that's what he's best at. In Special Correspondents the cast did a fairly good job but there was just something missing to make it a hilarious comedy. I don't regret watching it but I don't need to watch it a second time."
" Not Special, But Separate & Smart
",0.4443,0.9721,2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Not particularly special, no, but novel, it's at least something that isn't churned out in a different guide every single year. Granted it's a remake of a French film, but as much as a remake can be, the premise is original.Gervais plays the type of character he regularly plays in a lot of his work now, so in that respect it wasn't new, but it's a character people enjoy and a setting we haven't seen him in before. It's not hysterical, but it is witty and the quips flow nicely.The quality definitely peaks and dips throughout, it's a slow starter and towards the end gets incredibly predictable, but the secondary characters, i.e. Finch's wife provide the satire that Gervais does so well.Not groundbreaking, but a smart comedy which outshines a whole lot of crap which is regularly released trying to get laughs out of tired material. MacDonald with an American accent wasn't appreciated though."
" Quite nice to watch even in 2020
",0.4754,0.9611,2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"One of the better comedy films on netflix. I really enjoyed every moment of it, and I would gladly watch it again. The plot is good, the humour is classic Ricky Gervais, which I very much liked."
" Wonderfully funny...
",0.5994,0.8636,2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Yes ignore the bad reviews unless you don't like Christopher Guest movies (Best in Show. Waiting for Guffman etc) because if those movies go over your heads, you'll certainly miss the charm of this one. All of it is great but especially adored the Mexican couple who helps them out by lending their second floor.."
" Ordinary acting
",0.0,0.9665,2020-08-07 00:00:00,2,"This wasn't worth watching. There are a few funny lines but some characters are way off. The actual premise for the story is pretty good, just the execution is very ordinary. Even if you're a fan of the great Ricky Gervais, I'd give it a miss. I kinda wish I watched something else."
" Laugh out Loud Funny.
",0.7579,0.9397,2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Obviously, this could never happen in real life. But, put that aside and just buy into it.My wife and I both really enjoyed it. Gervaise, played a little against type and was great. Bana as well.Good stuff."
" Don't read reviews the movie is good
",0.4404,0.7003,2020-07-23 00:00:00,9,I had a suprisingly good time watching the movie. Story is good I don't know what the reviewers are talking about.
" A fun movie, how can it ""not be"" with Ricky!
",0.5562,0.9523,2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,"First of all I love anything Ricky Gervais does and this was no exception. Funny and cute, and Eric Bana is also great in it and a hunk, although I think Ricky is also a hunk. I watched Ricky in his Series- After Life and I knew then that he was a great movie producer. I will watch all of his movies from now on. He's the real deal. Don't listen to the bad reviews, just watch and enjoy!"
" Mediocre Correspondents
",0.0,0.962,2020-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Decent watch, might watch again, but hard to recommend over some many other things to watch.Ricky Gervais is funny enough at the worst of times, and Eric Bana plays off of him very well.The movie is funny, the story is a bit over dramatized, but that works in its favor as much as against it. Gervais typically has an edge of dark humor to his comedy.Its said outright early in the movie, but this is another one of those movies where the guy goes through way too much to find the right girl that was under his nose the whole time.I like that Kelly MacDonald and America Ferrera are in the movie as much as the movie itself, and they have the best parts.Take or leave this one, I don't think you'll be missing much if you skip it, but its good enough if you're having trouble finding what to watch."
" This is great and caustic satire
",0.6249,0.9805,2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand the negative ratings. This is a pretty good film and a very easy 98 minutes to spend your time.Yeah, it's not filled to the brim with funny but shallow one-liners. It's a classic comedy in that the situation is what makes it funny, and not the actors acting as crazy as they can. It's a satire that exaggerates a situation instead of exagerrating words.The things it satirizes are also pretty great. Since this film, journalism has really taken a downturn in the US. And I think that's what gets people uneasy about this. It's a movie that dares criticize the media and the 24-hour news cycle, and like any good satire, the targets of its humor don't like it."
" Missed opportunity.
",0.1531,-0.7991,2020-05-27 00:00:00,5,"I haven't seen the french original, but i know what movie this one reminds me of: ""Wag the dog"". The story is similar: Two low-class radio journalists fake a civil war in Ecuador to save their necks. And while the '97 comedy is an example for a great political satire, this one mostly falls flat even as a comedy.It does start out promising. The idea is also interesting and executed sorta acceptable for the first half hour. The characters work decently enough and their motivations seem legit, although it's all written very, very much on the nose. No buzzkill, but you pretty much can tell where it all goes within the first ten minutes.Yet even that was not meant to last. The screenplay drops into cheap shots and dump attempts at social satire. At the 1-hour-mark it becomes unbearably superficial and unintentionally clumsy. And while american culture is already treated poorly, i doubt the writers ever even looked Ecuador up on wikipedia. It's writing at its absolute laziest, relying on weak screwball stereotypes from the 80ies.The acting isn't amazing either. Ricky Gervais has one and only one character, he again is the pudgy underdog brit with the good-natured heart. By now it feels naive to expect more range from him. Then there is Eric Bana and this is the first comedy i've seen him in, but his deliveries only range from good-ish to weak. The only actors that feel spot on are Kelly Macdonalds as the wallflower love-interest and Kevin Pollak as the radio boss. Both seemed to me like they could have done more if they'd been given a chance. This screenplay didn't.The last two thirds of this movie are just dragging out the little material it has and it all left me unsatisfied and disappointed. ""The office"" was a far better remake."
" Enjoyable movie

" Worth every minute
",0.2263,0.9274,2020-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Special correspondents was ons of the best comedies iv'e seen in a couple of years. The Hollywood comedy scene has become complacent and boring, being filled with political agenda's with horrible scripts. This movie stand out. Great storyline, lots of sarcastic humor and straight to the point. Thank you Ricky"
" A good watch!!
",0.5399,0.9748,2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Amazed at its extremely low rating when we have so many Netflix offerings full of tasteless comedy and bs love making scenes, get 7.5+ . For me, it I'd a steady comedy, not out of mind witty but simple and solid. I have rated it 8 because it's storyline is very good, clean and concise. Actors are very well chosen and it binds you very easily to the story after 5-10 minutes. A definite watch during lockdown."
" Such a disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.2382,2020-05-17 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge fan of Ricky Gervais, but this film was a huge disappointment. There are no real laugh out loud moments, whilst the storyline is weak and highly predictable."

" The bad reviews are very harsh!
",-0.7897,-0.004,2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,This movie kept my attention and the storyline was interesting. It's not a conventional comedy but worth a watch. I almost stopped after first five minutes having seen all the bad reviews but glad I gave it a go.
" Classic Gervais
",0.0,0.91,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Classic Ricky Gervais movie. I enjoyed this remake of ""Envoyés Très Spéciaux"", by Simon Michaël. This version has a great balance of comedy and adventure. I think Mr Gervais has made better films, but this is certainly worth a watch."
" Ricky Gervais can do no wrong in my eyes
",-0.6486,0.9922,2020-03-26 00:00:00,9,"He has such a wonderful talent for baiting the politically correct morons and he does it with such subtlety that we can laugh in mock horror and not distress, just like we used to laugh at those seaside postcards..Humour as it once was and should be now.Laughter is a release for the human condition, good humour is handling the unfairness of life without being cruel. It allows us to both laugh at , and to be sensitive to, the paradox of life ........ and to my mind there's not many who do it better than Mr GThis movie is set in New York with Eric Bana playing a rebellious and ruggedly handsome radio reporter and Ricky Gervais playing the nice , innocent foil.The plot centres around an international assignment for the both of them which falls apart before they even leave the city.They are supposed to go to Ecuador to cover a civil war that is breaking out there but , and I won't spoil it by telling you how, it turns into a sweet story of scam and romance.The acting and pathos is really well done and Kelly Macdonald puts in another one of her stellar performances as Ricky's romantic interest.I don't know how Kelly does it but she has that special something that makes a routine part rise to excellence. I just love to see her on screen and in this appearance she is even better than she was in ""No Country for Old Men""The pacing is just right, as is the casting, and I have to say that it's one of the more enjoyable films I've seen in the past couple of monthsWell done Ricky and very well done for the rest of the cast and crew."

The whole cast is awesome!!, funny story, I dont judge a movie based on the normal criteria I judge in 1 thing was I entertained and I most certainly was!!!! Thanks ricky another great movie at a time we NEED to laugh!!!"
" Brilliant comedy
",0.743,0.8854,2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,Another great creation from Ricky Gervais! This is a really funny comedy about a team of journalists feeding crap to the public in hope to make the headlines. Not so far from reality. I actually think there is more to this movie. Gervais wanted to show how the media works but still keep it light and enjoyable.

" Simply alright ;-)
",0.4588,0.9686,2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,"I read the reviews here first and didn't know what to expect. It seemed like reviews were either love or hate with not much inbetween. I didn't find it THAT funny, but the story is enjoyable and it's obvious that it was supposed to be ridiculous and unrealistic at times. It wasn't boring or anything, good acting. All in all, something easy to watch, definitely funny at times."
" Agree with others, this is underrated
",0.3612,0.9795,2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"I've always admired Ricky Gervais and his work. This production was a perfect combination of humor, positive messages, and bromance. Loved Eric Bana, they played well of one another. Just surprised I had not discovered this one sooner. Thank you Netflix/Ricky. Definitely a feel good without the mush. Cheers!"

But I found it impossible to watch long enough to figure out how they finally made it out of the country.Also, I love Kelly McDonald (from Gosford Park), but is trying out an American accent a rite of passage now? I'm an afficionado of failed attempts. and hers is a delicacy."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.6369,2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"I dont understand why this movie havent got a higher rating.
Ricky Gervais at his best"
" Dissatisfied and disappointed
",-0.6908,0.707,2019-04-26 00:00:00,3,Poorly defined characters that contradict their intelligence and suave that is established in the first act. Premise is far-fetched. As the movie continues it gets more and more frustrating to watch because the characters make choices that no one would make. I'm sure this movie sounded good in a Blue Sky session but the reality is it's best avoided.
" Surprised with the low reviews
",-0.0516,0.9737,2019-04-10 00:00:00,8,"I have slated the majority of Netflix original films for being some of the worst films I've seen but I was really impressed with this one. The humour is witty and lead characters play their parts well: along with the supporting characters, especially Vera Farmiga. I was really surprised when I checked the ratings that it wasn't 7 or higher. Watch it and then make your own choice, you won't be disappointed."
" Awful but prescient
",-0.25,0.0772,2019-04-05 00:00:00,4,This movie is awful in every way. Luckily it will never be made again now that it has been acted out in real life by Robert Mueller and CNN.

" Full of dry british humour
",0.4767,0.9655,2019-03-17 00:00:00,8,Didnt have a clue what to expect but Im so glad I did. The story line was unexpected and a fantastically original. There was many laugh out loud bits especially when they started their broadcasting from the apartment. Subtle yet obvious I absolutely loved it and havent laughed as much since the remake of Jumanji. Well done all
" Very Enjoyable
",0.4927,0.7717,2019-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I laughed throughout this movie, it had a tight clever script that was delivered by a strong ensemble group.If you like Ricky Gervais's work then this is of the highest order. I understand many won't get the British humour, the anti-hero, the underdog, the ironic situations, the self-deprecation, etc etc. But if you do this is a gem."
" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9614,2019-02-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very entertaining. We've enjoyed watching it. Nice not to have to wait for it to pick up and get going. Keeps you interested all the way through. Lots of twists and turns. I'm not a critic, just a person that likes movies to engage me. This one doesn't disappoint."
" Predictable Uninspired Garbage
",0.0,-0.9644,2019-01-27 00:00:00,1,"This is by far one of the worst watches in recent years. You know exactly what's going to happen from the first 15mins. No twists or turns, nowt.I also found it very stereotypical with the South American couple who harbour the correspondents. Here's a newsflash USA, not all South Americans are stupid. Stop with this idiotic stereotype, it's just irritating now.It's a predictable rom-com in disguise with an annoyingly dull and completely unrealistic script.
So bad I can't even be bothered to make a joke about this one.
Gervais, your movies are a let down compared to your programs. Learn to stay in your element, not just rake in anything you can just because America pays well and magnifies your fame."
" Stale and Uninspired,
",0.0,0.9922,2018-12-24 00:00:00,5,"Special Correspondents is a mediocre movie with a shoddily written plot and a cast that are enjoyable but have been much better. Ricky Gervais and Eric Bana certainly have an excellent back and forth that makes for a very enjoyable viewing, It is just unfortunate their natural chemistry was put together with unnatural dialogue.I am a huge fan of Ricky Gervais, and it upsets me to see him deliver such average work, but the film really does feel unfinished, like there was so much more that could have been done to make this far better, for instance, strengthening the plot, but the passion just was not there. He definitely did not have half as much intrigue for this as he had for the likes of The Office or Extras, he was just asked by Netflix to make a movie and did.The characters are also immensely two dimensional, none of them have a quality that adds a real human element to them, every thing they say feels written.A stumbling mess. Not without its moments, Special Correspondents, unfortunately, does not have enough for me to recommend this.
Two down on their luck men fake a kidnapping while they hide out in New York.

" Not really that funny
",-0.3843,0.9542,2018-09-08 00:00:00,5,"Ricky Gervais I never found that funny but his movies are watchable. Eric Bana was well cast in this smarmy reporter role. Vera Farmiga was terrific as the uncaring money obsessed wife of Gervais. Works ok for a while, but it got boring quickly particulary when they were spending so much time in the room. Then when they went to Ecuador for real the action started. This wont stay in the memory long. Special Correspondents is like a mish-mash of some great ideas that go absolutely nowhere."
" Funny+ (No Spoilers)
",0.0,0.636,2018-08-28 00:00:00,8,"The stars' playing the roles of radio correspondent and techie have quirky personalities that work perfectly together in this quasi-misadventure that takes an unexpected turn south (no spoilers, pun intended) as they try to work their way out of a massive fib that could get them both fired and blackballed permanently. A rare comedy that reminds me of the Steve Martin films from back in the day. Highly recommending!"
" Not horrible, but not great either. Same old thing....
",-0.5448,0.894,2018-03-27 00:00:00,3,"At this point, Gervais (a comedic genius adept at live performances and excellent TV programs) has proven that he should avoid movies. Thus far everything that he's written and directed has contained phoned in performances and predictable scripts. I was really pulling for this one as all of the actors involved are top notch, but once again it was lack luster all around. Not horrible, but just....boring. All the actors felt like they were 'acting', rather than inhabiting the role. As for predictability, you can see the entirety of the script a mile a way. Also, Gervais has an annoying ""crutch"" that he uses in every movie by relying too much on musical montages. It felt like there were 3 or 4 music videos in the middle of the movie, then followed by that same......old......predictable.....last conversation between friends or lovers while the camera pulls up and out of the final scene. UghI wouldn't say avoid it, but don't get your hopes up. You'll just be waiting for it to end."
" Laugh? You will, if you get it.
",0.5574,0.8766,2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm amazed that although the US have adopted Ricky Gervais, that they still don't get him. Everything he's been involved in, that's ended up on a screen, has been a piss-take. Usually those piss-takes have offended people who don't get the joke, hence the 2 star Nutfux rating for this movie.The underline story is a simple one. A hunky heart-throb journalist and his blundering loser, sound-tech, fake a news story (never, ever happens), but, end up getting taken hostage, in Ecuador for real.
I say 'underline' story because that's exactly what it is. This is a complete piss-take of the American, star spangled moron. Its a salute to those who happily donate a dollar to any stupid cause that's got a stars and stripes draped over it. This is a satirical piece by Gervais, that's cloaked by a typical storyline that would get the bobble-hatted masses cheering for Uncle Sam and the Muurican way.
Laugh? You will, if you get it.Even the final words spoken by the brilliant, Kelly Macdonald and Gervais, gives the viewers a clue to the piss-take:
""This is like being in a movie""
""A low budget movie, really"""

" A Pleasant Surprise. A very solid film overall
",0.7425,0.9846,2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Don't go in expecting this to be the next Citizen Kane, but don't believe the negative reviews either.This film starts off as being a typical mismatched buddy comedy, but its plot has lots of depth and is quite multi layered. The characters are all very interesting as well and the first half of the film is a total knockout.The story goes to a point where the two protagonists end up in a tight corner and you really want to know how they will possibly get out of it. Its a very intriguing situation to say the least. Its outlandish but still within the realms of being believable.Then there is the comedy. I don't think I ever laughed out loud but the film definitely had me smiling for the bulk of its length.The final part of the film was not how I would have chosen to close the chapter, but even so it is the only little gripe I have about the film.As I said, don't expect a cinematic masterpiece when you go to watch the film, BUT, this is definitely one of the most solid films in the mismatched buddy comedy (mis)adventure genre to have ever been made (at least in recent years for sure).Its not the perfect film for sure, but well worth a watch."
" Not really up to comedy genius Gervais's standards
",0.4144,0.974,2017-09-02 00:00:00,5,"It's a Netflix-produced project written and directed by legendary comedy mastermind Ricky Gervais, who also stars alongside Eric Bana. A radio journalist (Bana) and his technician (Gervais) fake their own kidnapping during a rebel uprising in Ecuador and try to hide out in New York instead. Also appearing: Vera Farmiga, Kelly Macdonald, Kevin Pollak, America Ferrera, Raúl Castillo, Benjamin Bratt et al. Like most of Gervais's movies, it's not as sharp and funny as his famous for based on his other works (TV series, standup, podcasts etc). Sadly, it's also nearly not as mainstream friendly as most of his movies which have at least some memorable LOL moments. It's based on a decent idea and the screenplay is competent, but the humor is rather dry and intellectual, making one go I see what they did here"" rather than really enjoying the show. The satirical pokes about the authenticity of modern media business and the worthiness of the stars it creates gives the story at least some extra depth, even if you won't remember it the next morning. Dialogue and acting are competent, too, but we spend most of the time in the company of two men with no palpable chemistry – just doing their work and being professional about it. Always solid Vera Farmiga gives a more juicier performance as a technician's villainous wife but she can't conquer the overall dryness of it all, either. The movie also looks cheap, which is not a problem in itself because the small budget sets its limits. But I have to say it's overall one of the less exciting Gervais projects I've seen. Sorry. At least it doesn't go on for too long, although at 101 minutes it's not exactly short either. And yes, disappointing Gervais is still better than no Gervais at all. IMDb says it's a remake of 2009's French comedy ""Envoyés très spéciaux"". Both have mediocre user rating but the newer version has a bit higher score (5.8 vs 5.3 out of 10)."
" Not Laugh Out Loud - But A Decent Little Movie All The Same
",-0.2411,0.995,2017-08-30 00:00:00,7,"I must admit, as a huge fan of The Office, Extras and Ricky's stand up, I've become used to deep belly laughs aplenty whenever I watch the work of this great comic, and so before I sat down to watch Special Correspondents I was fully expecting a similar comedic experience. I was wrong.To anyone who plans to watch this movie who has a similar expectation - you may be disappointed. Do not, however, deprive yourself of what is a smart, entertaining movie. Once I accepted that there would only be a few chuckles here and there, I was able to genuinely enjoy Gervais' latest outing. This felt very much like a drama/comedy as opposed to a comedy/drama. There is a great chemistry between Gervais and Bana throughout, and for anyone who enjoys light satire this is definitely well worth a watch. I can't stress enough that if you are expecting tonnes of laugh out loud moments, you simply won't enjoy this movie for what it is, all though for fans of The Office, look out for a moment in the movie where Ian Finch (Gervais) attempts to record a heartfelt plea on video camera to the people of America, where he initially gets his tone and demeanor wrong - for around ten seconds he fully channels Brent. Priceless."
" a huge drop in creativity - but the reason is obvious.
",0.2263,0.0117,2017-04-18 00:00:00,3,"I did not laugh or even chuckle, as I more and more grimly watched this production.I won't bore you with the details, other than to say the plot was predictable once the premise was established, and was never believable. A big surprise, based on the genius of The Office and Extras. Still, when you see what a dud Derek also was, it doesn't take a genius to realize that the missing ingredient is Stephen Merchant. Once he left the collaboration, Gervais's comedic success has nosedived."
" A decent fish-out-of-water film
",0.0,-0.4064,2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"If there's one thing most people can agree on, it's that Ricky Gervais is a comic genius when it comes to making TV. The breadth of influence from his melancholy character creations on ""The Office"" and ""Extras"" has been seen all over the TV landscape.What's curious is that a lot of this innovation is absent in Ricky Gervais's films. ""Ghost Town"", ""Invention of Lying"" and this film basically work through the age-old comic method of character and opposing concept like (off the top of my head) guy who wishes to grow up meets adulthood (""Big"" or ""13 on 30"" in reverse), president wielding extraordinary power meets small-town politics (""Welcome to Mooseport""), thoughtless man with no appreciation for present meets eternal present (""Groundhog Day""), or powerless man meets eternal power (""Bruce Almighty"") ""Ghost Town"" is a case of a guy who wishes to be left alone being forced to deal with the dead on top of the living people he wishes to avoid. ""Invention of Lying"" is a case of man without influence gets power over gullible society. ""Special Correspondents"" is a case of lazy news reporters meeting real news.With the exception of ""Invention of Lying"" (which lends itself to home-run-hitting dialogue), none of these have the depth in their premise that could reach the same comic heights. As is, it's a decent film that works at the lower degree of difficulty set in by its script. The quieter moments of character development, though somewhat sitcom-llke, tend to work and the characters hit their notes.Ricky Gervais is a news reporter who has accepted he's a schlub in life (much like his ""Invention of Lying"" character at the start) despite somehow managing to snag Vera Farminga as a wife. Gervais digs relatively deep although the tone of the supporting cast (Vera Farmiga is pretty arch, America Ferrera is ""Latino comical"" in a way that mirrors Sofia Vergara's ""Modern Family"" role) and the film's plot would pick a fight with any sense of pathos. Still, Gervais is likable and kind of sweet and his chemistry with love interest (though the two have an admirably platonic vibe).Why Gervais is so stifled when he apparently has directorial control and is credited as a writer on these films is hard to figure out, but the film is what it is."
" Awesome
",0.6249,0.8717,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Like others have said: This is the kind of (sad ass?) comedy that Americans most often do not understand, because it is not uplifting and happy - thus the not fantastic rating on IMDb.Excellent movie, excellent story and excellent humor all the way. I'd rather watch this again than to watch some other random silly movie any day of the week, or something. Only Spinal Tap was more genius than this. And maybe a few other, that I can think of. But apart from those. Excellent."
" Spikes
",0.0,0.951,2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"There are spikes of comedic moments in this one and watching this I can only imagine how good the original movie must have been. Which I unfortunately haven't seen yet. The concept is pretty neat and it works overall. Bana and Gervais is a good fit, though it's not like you'll be rolling on the floor laughing.Apart from some highlights though, there is a lot of drought too. Which is a shame, because some ideas might sound funny on paper, but didn't translate onto the screen as well. It might be mildly amusing of course and if you don't have high expectations anyway, you will be more than entertained with this"
" Not too bad
",0.431,0.9689,2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I thought I would give it ago. The result: not the best movie but it was quite an enjoyable one, had great actors for the movie. It is one of those movies that you only watch once, maybe twice. The two main actors Eric Bana & Ricky Gervais worked together really well. There was a mix of everything, romance, comedy and action. Had some good supporting actors. I did get caught of guard with the language, as I am not the biggest fan of swearing. I was also a bit disappointed when Eric Bana & Ricky Gervais started doing drugs towards the end, I don't like drugs at all. So it did put a bit of a dampener on the movie. But a part from that the movie was enjoyable. A movie worth watching."
