" Solidarity!
",0.3595,0.9442,2021-04-04 00:00:00,7,Miners and the LGBT are the two unlikely but sensible allies and this movie does a good job of showing us that one time where they united in 1984s Britain - you start to think if they had been united more from the beginning how the world would have been different. A very good political movie.
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.5591,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,Pride is an important and uplifting film without stooping to sentimentality and is a crowd please that genuinely works.
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9538,2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,"It was really heartwarming, it actually gave some more fate in humanity. It's about a serious topic and it makes you think a little bit but it's also easy to watch. Overall it's a perfect balance and I loved it so so much."
" Movies like this make me have faith in humanity
",0.6486,0.9915,2021-03-31 00:00:00,8,"This is so well made, very moving but it made me feel better for the world when I stopped crying. Very nice story telling, the fact that the story is true makes it so powerful. I love it. The atmosphere was great and I enjoyed every bit. Great acting as well, everyone should watch it."
" A heart-warming experience
",0.0,0.7291,2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"On the surface, the subject seems unapproachable, especially for those unfamiliar with the historical events. However, any initial roadblocks soon didn't matter as I let the humor and great acting sweep me away."
" Lays it on a little too thick but nevertheless a poignant and heartwarming story
",0.631,0.9337,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"A brilliant cast deliver an often heartbreaking depiction of this unlikely alliance. The ease in which certain individuals cast aside their lifelong prejudices is a little fanciful and overall, the movie tends towards corniness. But there is enough string acting and great comedic writing to make Pride a memorable and moving experience."
" A strong movie with an incredible story
",0.5106,0.9924,2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I watched pride in classe a few weeks ago and I loved it.
First of all, the cast is very great, the acting is very impressive because it's so realistic. The actor who played the role of the main character, Bromley, did an outstanding performance. He's very touching and interesting because it allows us to address the issue of coming out and the difference in treatment in relation to the sexual majority in the United Kingdom.In addtion, the scene that I consider to be the climax of the films is when the LGSM activists are traveling to Wales where they will meet the striking miners and after they all start dancing together.To finish, the greatest compliment I can make about this film is that even if it's a comedy, it conveys a strong message. It show that that we should all support each, show solidarity regardless of our differences, like sexual orientation because we are all the same and we're equal. Also this film is symbolic and the history behind is very touching because it's a fight that LGBTQ+ community fought for many years for their freedom.I highly recommend this movie, if you haven't seen it yet !"
" WHERE ARE MY LESBIANS??
",0.0,0.9201,2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,I love the energy of this film. He represents great progress. There are moments to celebrate and to pause. The film takes up two social issues and shows how different but also how common they are. He confronts them with both wit and seriousness. The film shows hope.Both the LGSM and the old miners' committee stick together and their mutual reaction to each other's lives is remarkable.The film triggers a great deal of interest in my will to progress and shows what is possible. He made me cry and fight inside.
" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.9376,2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"I'm so mad at myself for not having watched this before! It's so beautiful, funny, and absolutely heartwarming!! There were moments I laughed out loud, moments I joined the dancing and moments my eyes got teary. Thank you (insert everyone involved)"

" LESBIANS AND GAYS SUPPORT THE MINERS!!
",0.508,0.9529,2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,Absolutely fantastic movie based on real events where a local support group consisting of London's gay and lesbian community travel to a mining village in Wales to lend their support against the government with a fair amount of resistance from some of the locals. The story was told so well and acted superbly well. Highly recommended to watch as its one of those gems that flew way under the radar
" Something special
",0.4019,0.7964,2020-09-05 00:00:00,10,You know you are watching something special when you caught yourself with a silly smile throughout the film and tears pouring down your cheeks. Just wonderful and very wholesome.

" A creative action leads to powerful impacts
",0.6908,0.8625,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"The above statement can refer to both the movie and to when it happened in the 80's.

Powerful, sad, inspiring."

" A film about gay people that's not about gay people
",0.0,0.9966,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"It's not about gay people or miners but about two groups of people from very different backgrounds discovering that they are not that different after all, and connecting on an incredibly human level.
Every little subplot is beautifully handled, almost every character adds something to the story and is given their due, not one of them is there just for the sake of adding another face.
Especially Mark's character moved me, though. He is the face and the force of his group, and he combines the main values that this film is about: solidarity, loyalty, and fighting with everything you have for what you believe in.
The film just keeps getting better and better and when you think it couldn't possibly get any better, the ending tops it all - and it actually happened in real life!
And the cherry on top: its so incredibly FUNNY!! I don't normally watch a lot of comedies because I often think they tend to be a bit silly, but in this one had me reconsider my opinion on the genre. The comedic parts and the dramatic parts are well balanced, and it manages to convincingly tell a story about a serious subject while maintaining a light tone.
Side note: my father, 60 years old, a tad conservative (he has no connection to or interest in the gay community whatsoever) watched it on my recommendation, and he really enjoyed it. So: please give it a try, it will be two hours well spent!"
" ""Six gays and a dyke"".... A true story of bigotry, fear, hope and optimism...
",0.3612,0.9076,2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"A true tale of solidarity that united two pretty unlikely parties back in 1980s Britain. A group of young gay activists decide to support the striking miners and so travel to a Welsh village to help out. There they face a population with serious problems; not just immediate but also longer term attitudinal and traditional considerations too. They are also unfamiliar/intolerant of anything remotely connected with London's gay attitudes and/or lifestyle - and the spectre of AIDS is uppermost in many minds too. The gang are led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) and before long this is much broader story about acceptance of all by all - albeit told with a very left-wing bias that won't be for everyone; particularly those who remember the interminable strikes in the UK in the 1970/80s. There is a smashing performance from George MacKay, too, as a young man coming to terms with his own sexuality - and with his parents! Andrew Scott, Dominic West, Jessica Gunning and Paddy Considine add richness and depth to a series of parallel and genuinely eye-opening (frequently comical) themes and the ending - at the first ""Pride"" event in London must bring a tear to your eye; whatever your politics or sexuality."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.2528,2020-01-01 00:00:00,8,"A piece of history. i've been move to tears. I did not know about that story. I start my sentimental life a bit before 80's. I a can testify how hard it was to live a life, as we were surrounded by haters (most by ignorance). This movie put everything in perspective and tell one thing ""solidarity has healing property for human kind"". unfortunately, the ruling calls put all they got to prevent people to support each others. Don't let them win ! it was A great film !"
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.7096,2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,It's an excellent movie that shows to the people the power of solidarity and humanitarian.
" About as perfect as can be achieved
",0.5719,0.9621,2019-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I've only recently discovered this film and am so impressed I've watched it twice over two evenings, with the second viewing even more impressive than the first, with so many details. A genuine story about brotherhood and solidarity, and all the more stunning because it's a true story, and it sticks to the facts - rare in films that are supposed to be true. Highly recommended!"
" Just brilliant!
",0.6239,0.7558,2019-08-17 00:00:00,10,"It is an enormous task to make a film seriously yet funny. This film, however, delivers! Some questions remain unanswered, but the fact that it's about real people, real differences; it made me cry. This is how the world should be! Peaceful, without prejudice. If all the 'weaker' people come together, we can make a difference. And this film shows just that! It's full of empowerment, and that's what we need in 2019!"
" Perfect balance
",0.5719,0.97,2019-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Before even being made, this film had the huge advantage of having an extraordinary and a emotionally compelling real story as its raw material. I can't imagine how anyone would not be moved to tears by this story.Of course good raw material doesn't automatically make a good film - plenty of examples to the contrary exist, so what we have here is a perfectly executed artistic achievement from start to finish: the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the music. It's one of those times when stars align to make something perfect. The balance between emotion and lightheartedness is incredible, the cast is outstanding, the pacing doesn't miss a beat. Watching this is so deeply moving it's almost cathartic in the end."
" Great, great, great film
",0.9231,0.5267,2019-07-11 00:00:00,10,Shows the history of the great battle of miners strike and how the LGSM did what they could to support them through on of the toughest period of welsh history
" Important piece of history
",0.2023,0.8979,2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,This was such a wholesome film that it left me in tears at the end. It highlights the necessity of coming together by supporting each other as well as loving each other whichever sexual orientation you are. A beautiful movie that serves as a vessel for progression and change still relevant now.
" Fabulous-brilliant-touching-inspirational
",0.0,0.9932,2019-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Based on a true story PRIDE is really a great film about understanding, tolerance, friendship and solidarity !! The main story is about the encounter between the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) and the miners in the Dulais Valley in Wales !! But also around the event there are several personal stories (people whose life changed after this encounter.
PRIDE is a film with great emotions : for example when the women began to singing ""Bread and Roses"" !! But also a film full of British humour !!
The performances of all the actors and actresses are excellent.
Again I repeat a great historical moment of friendship and solidarity !!"
" My all-time favourite film
",0.0,0.5779,2019-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I am not a film person, as I find it hard to sit still and watch something all the way through, but I have watched Pride on countless occasions and will again in the future.
There's something about the film that I can't get away from. The chemistry between the actors is magnificent and the tone is so upbeat and uplifting whilst also drawing attention to very serious topics at the time.
I think this film captures an important piece of history; something I didn't know about until watching this a few years ago. Mark Ashton will never be forgotten thanks to this film.
I've forced almost everyone I know to watch it!"
" A great piece of LGBT history
",0.6249,0.9602,2019-04-22 00:00:00,7,"In 1984, a group of gay and lesbian London activists raises funds to give financial support to striking miners in Wales . At the beginning, there are serious tensions between these two very disparate groups until they realize they have common enemies: the government of Margaret Thatcher and slanderous right-wing tabloids. This film is based on a true story.""Pride"" does a fine job in its portrayal of the struggles of the gay/lesbian movements in many countries in the 1980s: while there was progress, it was at a great price due to the massively collective homophobia of the time. This interesting recent history might have been better portrayed if the film had been longer than its two hours. There are many interesting characters and we only get to see glimpses of them. More time might have allowed the viewer to know more of the characters.Some characterizations did work well though. One is a gay Welshman who left rural Wales to escape homophobia. Actor Andrew Scott makes much of his brief scenes by conveying deep emotion in his face. Another interesting story is of a young, closeted gay man who has recently moved to London . His journey into adulthood is finely told.The directing by Matthew Warchus is competent but conventional. More flair and style might have had more impact. There are also times it's difficult (at least to those of us English-speakers outside England and Wales) to understand the accents and colloquial terms. This is unfortunate as many in-jokes are missed.The film can be praised for its relatively balanced gender casting - a rarity in many movies. The number of female characters is not grossly outnumbered by the number of males. Also, as the women are relatively ordinary folks, they are portrayed by regular-looking actresses who do not look like supermodels, contradicting a trend not just in Hollywood films but in independent and international films as well, including French cinema""Pride"" is a fine film worth seeing especially for its hopeful and moving finale. I was pleased but not surprised to read that a musical stage version of this film is already in the works. Bring it on! - dbamateurcritic"

Based on real events and real people, told with humour, the development of understanding between two different but demonised communities in that dark time when the UK was deeply divided, won't be popular with Thatcherites, but is a must for those of us who still feel a shiver down the spine at the mention of her name."

" Enjoyable film, but it's all just a bit too nice
",0.6858,0.6228,2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those films where its hard to pin down exactly what's wrong. The acting is first rate, the dialog is realistic and amusing, and costumes, props and sets appear pretty much spot on. I think its that it is all just a bit too sanitised and everyone is just a little bit too nice. Most of London was a filthy, miserable place in the early 80s (see High Hopes by Mike Leigh), the majority of people where somewhat lacking in money, and it really wasn't until after the riots in 1985 that the overall tackiness started to fade. - in contrast, everyone here appears to be fairly well-off and all turned out in their Sunday best whenever we see them and all of London looks quite nice. Even more noticeable, every working mens club in 1984 had to be viewed through a thick fug of tobacco smoke and however well they were looked after, furniture and furnishings were apt to be tinted brown from tar, somewhat tired and all rather second-hand. Finally, even though this is a light-hearted look back, I did feel the bigotry and discrimination was side-stepped and over-sanitised, things did start to progress in this period, but not really that much.."
" A friend in need is a friend indeed & here it goes mutually.
",0.7506,0.9918,2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is how Lesbians and Gay activist support strike of miners. It further highlights how in return they get support from miners, to gain acceptance for their rights.If you belong to a certain community and a movie is made highlighting them you automatically get attracted towards it. This is where it was indifferent to me. However if you are curious you would get entertained by certain aspects that are filmed or made known.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Good. I liked 'Bread and Roses' with its melody (fan of such music). Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: Extend your hand for help; you won't be disappointed in the long run. A friend in need is a friend indeed and that goes mutually."
" Pride joyfully prides itself in being a feel good, if occasionally flat, comedic drama.
",0.8813,0.9899,2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,"It's a rare occurrence to encounter a historic British LGBT film that manages to be entertaining and somewhat informative, with minimal fictionalisation. Much like the pride group itself, this drama is bolstered by a myriad of colourful characters against the dreary backdrop of the Miners' Strike, evoking both political and social contextual themes. A passionate rally consisting of homosexuals attempt to be heard by supporting a small mining town in Wales during the infamous Strike during Thatcher's government. Thus, the support group LGSM was formed. The film confidently illustrates the struggles of homosexuality, on both a personal and national perspective, within 1980's Britain. Segregation from heterosexuals due to the AIDS epidemic, homophobic violence and inaccurate publicity from the press. Yet, the light British comedy complements these heavier topics well in what ultimately is a fluffed up drama. Some additional focus on the hardship for the group and specific members, particularly Bromley coming out to his parents or Gethin visiting his mother after abandonment, would've enhanced the minimal amount of emotional attachment for these people. However, the consistently light tone gets the job done and depicts an important milestone in British LGBT history. The plethora of fresh and experienced talent amongst the cast highlights the raging talent within the country. From a feisty Nighy and Staunton to an innocent MacKay and Scott. The old and young, straight and gay, made for several humorous moments that will certainly put a smile on your face. It's narrative structure lacks cohesion, starting by following a new member as he rapidly joins the group which allows an outsider's perspective. This then instantly changes and shifts between each member's backstory as well as the residents of the Welsh town. It's overstuffed with too many characters. Pushing that aside, it's a wonderfully enjoyable drama that seamlessly blends history with general entertainment, powered by excellent performances."

" Fabulous film.
",0.5267,0.9908,2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"An absolute feel-good film, beautifully crafted, filled with interesting and well-enacted historical detail, excellent cinematography, top-notch writing, pitch-perfect acting, and classy straightforward directing.Based on a true story, this gem of a film memorialises events which though politically significant are largely overlooked by history. We all remember the miner's strike of 1984-5, but how many people remember (or were ever even aware of) the pivotal role of the gay and lesbian community in that historic clash, or what transpired in British politics as a result of it?This is a terrific film on many levels; as a piece of entertainment it is well-paced and enjoyable throughout, lifting the spirits and raising an occasional tear. As a historical re-enactment it is well researched, enlightening, and nostalgic. As a political commentary it is thoughtful, articulate, intelligent, and avoids pretty much every potential pitfall, with not a sledgehammer to be seen.All in all, a very well-rounded piece of British filmmaking that ticks many boxes. Worth a watch. Or two. Or three..."
" Pride
",0.34,0.9989,2018-04-01 00:00:00,7,"When I heard about this British film, I knew it was LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) related, and critics described it as tapping the same formula as The Full Monty and Billy Elliot, I was looking forward to it. Based on a true story, in the summer of 1984, at the time of the miners' strike, Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) is a gay activist, joining the Gay Pride Parade in London, and 20-year-old student Joe Cooper (Sunshine on Leith's George MacKay) from Bromley is exploring his own sexuality, he watches the parade, before becoming part of it. Soon enough Joe joins a small group of Gay and Lesbian activists led by Mark, they plan their protests and actions from bookstore Gay's the Word, run by gay couple Gethin Roberts (Spectre's Andrew Scott) and Jonathan Blake (Dominic West). Mark says that the gay community are not being harassed by the police as much, because the miners are their new targets, with many police officers violently arresting and beating them, and just like the gay community, the public and government are hostile towards them, and the subject of smear campaigns from the tabloid newspapers. Mark announces the formation of ""Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners"" to help raise money, many activists refuse to join, because of past experiences of discrimination and aggression from miners against the gay community. Therefore, LGSM consists of ""six gays and a dyke"", they start raising money immediately, and Joe is their official photographer, their actions prove successful. The National Union of Mineworkers however is reluctant to accept their support, worrying about associating with a gay group. Frustrated with the lack of response, the activists instead go directly to a mining village, they choose Onllwyn, a small mining village in Wales. They are excited to have money raised by the LGSM accepted, but spokesperson Dai Donovan (Paddy Considine) comes to London, where he discovers they are a gay and lesbian group, he admits to never meeting gay people before, to which Mark responds he has never met a miner before. Dai quickly realises the importance of the alliance between the two communities, he is asked to give a speech at the local hall, the gay and lesbian crowd are sceptical and hostile at first, but with an eloquent speech, he wins their hearts and minds. SiÃ¢n James (Jessica Gunning), starting volunteering at the community centre, overhears the Women's Support Group debating whether to invite LGSM to their village, despite her husband Martin (Rhodri Meilir) urging her not to make herself stand up, she speaks out to invite the LGSM, and she becomes a member of the Women's Support Group. It is soon clear some are unwilling to let the gays come over, Maureen Barry (Lisa Palfrey) vehemently opposes the gay and lesbian support. When the LGSM arrive in Onllwyn, they are met by a silent and hostile crowd, and Mark's clumsy speech does not improve the situation, with many walking out. The next day, the LGSM are taken sightseeing around the countryside by SiÃ¢n and Cliff Barry (Bill Nighy), in the distance they see police arresting more miners, a form of harassment against the miners, Jonathan says to SiÃ¢n they are doing it unlawfully. The miners celebrate their release at the community centre, following SiÃ¢n barging into the police office to demand they be freed, most miners now regard the LGSM as allies. That evening at the community centre, the gays and lesbians feel the sense of community among the villagers, letting go of their own prejudices against the miners, Mark announces that the LGSM will organise a spectacular fundraising event, to make the government meet the miners' demands, but there is no idea yet. Maureen Barry, bitter about the miners and support groups embracing the gays and lesbians, contacts a tabloid about the LGSM, the next day the police show up, and The National Union of Miners urges the Onllwyn support group to sever ties with the LGSM. Mark and the group read the newspaper headline, being called ""perverts"", they decide to adopt this term, and create a music festival event, titled ""Pits and Perverts"", taking place at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town. At first no record label is willing to have their artists play at the festival, but eventually they secure Bronski Beat, members of the Men's and Women's Support Groups from Onllwyn and other villagers show their interest and come to London, and the festival is a huge success. The next day there is supposed to be a meeting, but when it is rescheduled, and the LGSM arrive late, ties with the support groups are severed, Cliff and Martin, lacking the eloquence of Dai, could not stand up for them. SiÃ¢n and the other women confront Maureen, she believes the LGSM were only supporting the miners for their own gay rights agenda, but SiÃ¢n shows the thousands raised by at the festival, they use it to buy a red van, driven by Hefina (BAFTA nominated Imelda Staunton), to transport the miners to protest rallies. In March 1985, the Miners' Strike ends, the miners of Onllwyn go back, Joe sees them off, Mark has alienated himself from the LGSM, after a personal crisis over his fear of contracting HIV, he confronts Joe about hiding his homosexuality from his parents, Joe eventually confronts his parents and makes his own choice to leave them. The LGSM and Lesbians Against Pit Closures attend the 1985 Gay Pride Parade, the LGSM are disappointed at first about not being allowed political signs, but the red van shows up, and several of the villagers join to support them. The parade organisers tell them to go to the front, as there are too many people, including hundreds led by the National Union of Mineworkers. In the end, in 1986 the Labour Party incorporated rights for gays and lesbians in their party programme, due to pressure from the National Union of Mineworkers, and the end text says what many of the characters did next. Also starring This Is England's Joseph Gilgun as Mike, Matthew Flynn as Tony Cooper, Freddie Fox as Jeff Cole, Liz White as Margaret Donovan, Monica Dolan as Marion Cooper, Harry Potter's Jessie Cave as Zoe and Russell Tovey as Tim. The cast are all well chosen for their parts, with many of these kinds of films, it is funny, moving and dramatic in the rights places, it has a great witty script full of terrific one-liners, a splendid soundtrack of songs, and it has many feel-good moments in amongst the realistic and powerful serious points, all together it is an enjoyable historical comedy drama. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for writer Stephen Beresford and producer David Livingstone, and it was nominated for Best British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!"
" Often intriguing, although curiously lacking, drama about leftist-unity in 80's Britain.
",0.0,0.9939,2018-03-30 00:00:00,5,"I could never understand what everybody was supposed to be so 'proud' of when it came to homosexual identity, or LGBT rights. Was it the rise of the presence of the AIDS virus? Surely not. That society generally became more promiscuous? The fact that Judeo-Christian values copped one in the eye? Probably. Whatever the reason for the pride, it isn't answered in ""Pride"" - a colourful leftist wet-dream which is probably too long and, while ambitious, doesn't impact in the way it perhaps might have done if it were more focused and carried with it more of a directorial stamp.Homosexuality has, in essence, always been despised - irrespective of the era and irrespective of the civilisation. For centuries, it was outlawed around the world under religious dogma: Christianity; Islam; Hinduism... Then came the world's first atheist state in the form of the Soviet Union, whose women averaged four abortions in a lifetime but whose homosexuals were still criminalised. So much for socialist egalitarianism. In Cuba, run by the supposed poster-boy of the left at the time of this film's setting (the 1980's), Fidel Castro had homosexuals grossly maltreated.In the modern age, the ghost of Alan Turing looms large over western civilisation's moral compass when it comes to such people: a man with a mathematical mind so brilliant, it would be dishonest to say that it didn't contribute to the British war effort against the Nazi machine to the same extent as Wallace and Montgomery. Despite being a hero, he remained a pariah simply for being gay. All of this leads us to life in Britain in the penultimate decade of the last century, where ""Pride"" tells, firstly, the true story of young Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) - an LGBT and Communist activist who took pity on the mining communities' treatment by the government - and the more synthetic narrative of a twenty year old rube named Joe (George MacKay), who lives at home in what looks like an affluent Conservative Party stronghold and is beginning to realise he's gay. Primarily, ""Pride"" is interested in Ashton's trying to get together a makeshift relief-effort entitled LGSM (Lesbians & Gays Support the Miners) in order to help said miners as they struggle out of work. 'But why should anyone care about them?' asks somebody. ""Because miners dig for coal, which produces power, which allows gay people like you to dance to Bananarama till 3 o'clock in the morning."" Eventually, a community in South Wales hear of the group and Matthew Warchus' film moves to tell the story of the two parties coming together.Where the film is at its strongest is during the earlier phases of the miners, initially led by Paddy Considine's Dai, and Ashton's LGBT troupe hooking up. Set at a time when the political dichotomy in Britain was not yet entirely broken, there are stark binaries between the two groups which make for intriguing viewing: the obvious physical disparity lies in the difference between the big, butch miners and Mark and his effeminate friends. The LGSM are more into their synth-pop, whereas the miners enjoy their slower, traditional guitar music. The miners are far from 'Conservative', but possess a small, close-knit community consisting of nuclear families whose children are suddenly being exposed to a brash homosexual subculture. It is still a tetchy issue. Indeed, one friend of Mark's refuses to do a damn thing for the miners on account of having been bullied for being gay when he lived in a mining community up north. Ideologically, two of Mark's friends are, ultimately, entrepreneurs and therefore capitalists, where the miners are ardent socialists and vote Labour. But was it not, after all, Antonio Gramsci who once wrote that the bloody, muddy experiences of World War One acted as the unifier of the despised classes so that they now all share the same goal of toppling capitalism/discrimination/injustice etc.?Where the film struggles is in its lack of any real substantive plot. Its secondary strand, that of Joe's emerging homosexuality and his shame in having to keep it from his loving, though traditionalist, parents is underdeveloped where it might have really been the explosive core of the film. The second act lacks coherence, and essentially consists of either group traveling to visit one another. Certainly, by the time it has resorted to characters rolling around in fits of giggles clutching sex aides, it has somewhat lost us. Irrespective, the film does well to capture what it felt like to be in Britain at the time with these various political factions co-existing. It is never cordially established, but I would guess many of those around Mark, being as metropolitan and from London as they are, would have found allegiance with the old Liberal Party more-so Labour when it was run by the likes of Foot and Benn. They are, therefore, more out of step with the miners than they perhaps realise. Warchus encompasses those from each of the three sides of the British political triangle of the time impressively: the struggling socialist communities living under Thatcherism; the Liberals who, whilst more capitalist than they'd care to think, utterly reject right-wing social attitudes and the Tories, with their housing estates characterised by detached properties; bourgeois gatherings; 'homophobia' and green and pleasant front lawns. Mark Ashton was a real person, and according to the Internet, was a member of the British Communist Party back when the Cold War was still on and the Kremlin itself was responsible for funding much of its activism. Was he even aware of the USSR's position on queer people? The film does not say. What it does have to say, however, is that he was a brave individual who stood for what he believed in and copped a lot of flak for it. Whatever your position on anything in life, there is something to be drawn from that and his tale depicted here."
" Fun, moving true story
",0.7269,0.9961,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Pride' is a simple British film that manages to be about lots of things all at once, all while being charming and quaint, as only the Poms can do! It's set in London (and Wales) in 1984 and follows a small group of gay & lesbian activists who decide to do stand up to the Thatcher government - not for gay rights, but for the rights of the striking miners! It's all handled quite well and doesn't become a full on drama, or a full on comedy - or even a full on ""political"" or ""gay"" movie.Sure, there's definitely lots of political messages being explored - and you would like to think the world, in general, is a more tolerant place 30 years later - but the film's really about this group of six friends banding together and supporting another put-upon group, a small mining community in Wales. This is where a lot of the humour comes from - the old Welsh ladies having fun with ""their gays"" and ""their lesbians""!The cast is superb - even though Nighy is probably under-utilised - with Mark (Schnetzer) & Joe (McKay) particularly captivating. The soundtrack/score is also great, although there's obviously some disco! Well-paced and with a great ending, this is a very enjoyable film."
" British Film at its Best!
",0.6696,0.9535,2017-07-31 00:00:00,8,Pride tells the story of a group of U.K. activists that form a group called Gays & Lesbians Support the Miners. They lead the charge in collecting money and materials to support miners during the strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984. In the telling of this true story a good many of the actual people involved are present during some of the march sequences. Good acting all the way around and an enjoyable film.
" Inevitably-one-sided but persuasive telling of a quite amazing true story
",0.8947,0.9987,2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I watched the Matthew Warchus-Stephen Beresford offering ""Pride"" just days after media heralded the first week in centuries in which the UK engaged in no large-scale power generation from coal. I use the word ""heralded"", since - while there were many references to that being ""historic"", it was hard to see much regret. Today, coal is viewed as a dirty source of CO2. The fact that we might someday need some for strategic purposes - just in case - seems wrongly skimmed over, but should we really mourn the passing of coal as main everyday fuel? This is a first key perspective against which ""Pride"" can be set, while the second concerns the relatively recent death of Lady Thatcher - a person who receives zero sympathy in this film, as well she might not given the authentic recreation of the circumstances of 1984. However, this is 2014 work that refuses to acknowledge what Maggie knew - that each taxpayer had by 1984 been subsidising the coal industry for decades to the tune of thousands. This is likewise a film ready to simplify Arthur Scargill down into a hero-leader of working miners, and to present police officers as little more than suppressors of rights ready to deploy physical and verbal abuse against strikers. Finally, it is a film largely unprepared to acknowledge that miners lived short, dirty, diseased and unpleasant lives that few would envy, and that many did their level best to escape from. The closest we get to this last recognition is a brief line uttered by Bill Nighy's character ""Cliff"", who makes it clear that members of his close family have been killed by their occupation.In short, and with the best will in the world, ""Pride"" is irrevocably pro-miner, decades after the events, showing how opinions on the miners' strike will remain divided - perhaps forever, with black v white, and little nuancing or attempt to present both sides of the argument.Interestingly, your reviewer is not quite like that...While this film cannot persuade me to renounce my admiration for ""Maggie"" overall, I do find sympathy for the miners' cause evoked in me by ""Pride"" (just as I find it evoked by ""Brassed Off"" - the similarly-themed Mark Herman film made in 1996, hence far closer to the portrayed events). I AM NOT made of stone, even if the makers of ""Pride"" seem to be.Of course, ""Pride"" goes beyond the strike per se to report the remarkable alliance struck up between young male and female homosexuals and Welsh miners at a time when anti-Thatcher sympathies were NOT enough to bridge gaps of prejudice, even when the L&G community did all they could to raise funds to help the miners and their families. The fact that these were often English city-dwellers from the ""soft South"" made the divide even more visible!This is obviously then an amazing story worth telling, and it is here told with warmth, insight and humanity, and indeed - in this dimension at least - with the necessary nuancing. AIDS was just getting going then, and potential sufferers and society were both scared, for the same and different reasons. This ensured that anti-gay sentiment gained reinforcement just at a time when sexual-minority rights would otherwise have been making further progress. Even the 21 age of consent for male homosexuals was still in place. It was a quite different world, and one that gains authentic presentation.The aforementioned Bill Nighy plays far from his usual part, and is perhaps the most compelling character - a quiet, poetic soul thrilled by mining history and culture, though not quite blind to its costs, a repressed homosexual himself and a gentle man resorting to the strongest possible language as he spews out his loathing of ""Thatcher"". His fellows in the mining community include the reasonable, bridge-building ""Dai"", whose portrayal by Paddy Considine is just right. And, needless to say, Dai's mix of crusading and pragmatism at first gets far more support from the true unsung heroes of every such industrial village - the wives and mothers. Here we get quite superb performances from Imelda Staunton as the gung-ho Hefina, as well as the quieter kindness personified of Gwen, played by an excellent Menna Trussler. On the L&G side there is an absolute plethora of great acting to savour, be it from Faye Marsay as the lovely (in every sense) ""Steph"" or Dominic West as older gay actor Jonathan Blake - in real life still alive in 2017, despite being among the first people in Britain to be diagnosed HIV+. Then of course there is our hero ""Joe"", played by George Mackay; Gethin (Andrew Scott) and real-life early AIDS victim Mark Ashton - also a communist (though the film chooses not to go there), who is just superbly played by Ben Schnetzer. On this side of the film, this is an ensemble chosen with care to offer a non-stereotypical presentation of the whole spectrum of types and personalities that the lesbian and gay community (just of course like ANY OTHER COMMUNITY) can muster.Ultimately, ""Pride"" remained an at-times uncomfortable watch for me, but solely because I believe the cynically manipulative and self-adoring Scargill had an agenda beyond UK pits, while Maggie had a duty (was repeatedly elected) to see the big economic (and even environmental) picture. That is also a story that will need telling someday. In the meantime, here is a film that I still appreciated greatly, portraying an incongruous and priceless situation from history enjoyably, thoughtfully and deftly, through truly classy performances.But concession-making is a two-way process. If I can swallow my ""pride"", sacrifice political beliefs to see the merit in (and even feel sympathy for) arguments presented by the other side, well perhaps so also can they, one day..."
