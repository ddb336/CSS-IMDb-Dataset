" Worst Hercules ever!
",-0.6588,-0.5106,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Dwayne ""Dumb as a Rock"" is a more suitable moniker."
" FUN AND ENJOYABLE RIDE
",0.7351,0.9319,2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Dwayne Johnson plays the classical hero, leading a squad of mercenaries to defend the king of Thrace. An entertaining action flick, Hercules offers a fun and enjoyable ride, retelling the story of the legendary character and his heroics. But the climax could've been better and the battles scenes aren't epic. Nevertheless the film with its sprinkling of tongue-in-cheek lines makes the 98 minutes a fun watch.Rating: 6,7."
" Seven Samurai Go To Greece
",0.0,0.9811,2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This isn't Greek mythology. This is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven, if you prefer) with some names from Greek mythology and a bunch of CGI slathered over it.Duane Johnson plays the role of the bald guy who rubs his head and recruits all the rest of the Samurai (or Yul Brynner as Chris)All the way down the line to the sn0t-nosed kid representing the character played by Toshiro Mifune/Horst Buchholz.They get hired by the leader of the local impoverished shythole to save them from the rampaging warlord/bandit. He offers to pay in gold (admittedly a lot better than rice in Seven Samurai). Nominally in Magnificent Seven it's gold but the gold doesn't actually exist.They go through all the similar training. Some scenes and dialogue seem like a direct lift.Anyway, as long as you don't go expecting to see anything remotely resembling Greek mythology. And better yet, haven't actually seen the vastly superior Seven Samurai (to say nothing of the splendid Magnificent Seven) you will probably enjoy this CGI-filled tale of dirt farmers battling pillaging warlords.It's beautifully shot and expensively cast. With a lot of atmospheric smoke. What more could you ask for on a Saturday night."
" Good entertainment with a twist!
",0.7177,0.9201,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Nice twist in the story with big action. The movie keeps it real. A lot of the fantasm and the mythical creatures get there fair chance being explained because of the background of these ancient stories. Not everything is what they tell and that keeps the movie original.
Good acting and a nice cast."
" Fake Demigod and demons
",-0.4767,-0.1451,2020-12-10 00:00:00,3,"I just wasted an hour and a half waiting for the scenes in the preview to show up that made it true of the Hercules story. I'm regretting spending $14 on a buff dude who only has a reputation because of help he gets from a clan he travels with. Also all the stories that are ""told"" are myth. He ""defeated"" a Hydra and somehow kept the heads(false of that) and in the bag it was a mask covering a human decapitated head. Don't waste money if you want the Mythical version... the preview doesn't do anything except portray lies."

" The Results Of The Fantasy Of The Imaging Faculties
",0.0,-0.3612,2020-11-26 00:00:00,1,"Some time ago, someone had the ridiculous idea of mixing fables, folklores, legends & myths with non-fiction and/or history. Hercules is one such non-sense story."
" I Actually Liked This
",0.4215,0.8805,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"Dwayne Johnson plays Hercules as he goes from a mercenary for John Hurt -- the English one -- to someone with a conscience.I expected this to be about as ridiculous as The Legend of Hercules, released the same year. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is the production and cast first rate, with some fine cinematography by Dante Spinotti, but director Brett Ratner's staging allowed me to play the ""where did they lift that shot from"" game; I identified bits from SAMSON AND DELILAH, SPARTACUS, and CONAN THE BARBARIAN during the denouement alone.It's based on a graphic novel by Steve Moore. Because he got no money from it, Moore asked fr his name to be removed from the credits. He died soon after he made the request, and so wound up not only with the credit, but a dedication. All free to the producers!"
" Listen to me
",0.0,0.8968,2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,I know why people. Think this movie sucks but I think it's a masterpiece really we don't know what happen to Hercules after the 12 labors (I think) but really The Rock fits well as Hercules and the battle scenes are just amazing don't hate on this movie but really if I'm missed everything wrong with it just tell me I would understand the acting is good too and the movie at least needs some thoughts really the movie is a b tier if I had it
" Interesting Spin
",0.4019,0.5574,2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,It's a cool take on the whole legend. Johnson is made for this type of role and even eases up on the botox.
" The second half is blatanly stupid!
",-0.5707,-0.9832,2020-06-17 00:00:00,4,"Sorry, but I can´t really give this movie a good rating, although it starts quite well...First half was nice, not gonna lie!But the ""plot-twist"" is just so badly written, that a lot of small details don´t make any sense!Like; why doesn´t Rhesus take his time and to spread the truth about Lord Cotys?
And what nonsens is the the ""raided village"" scene now? Was it all faked?
This makes just too little sense at all.But the real bummer is the showdown!
This is so ridicilous and so plain stupid!
Why do Lord Cotys men even follow him at all, although he just revealed his true evil face?!?
Are all of his men mean, bad, bloodthirsty bandits?
I thought they were farmers?
How can they follow a lord, that literally shouts out his evil plans?The second half was just breathtaking awful and idiotic!"
" What A Cheesy Film !
",0.0,0.6918,2020-06-15 00:00:00,1,"Hercules , of Samoan and black Canadian origins, is wearing a wig, and fighting somewhere in Hungary / Croatia ! What else can be said about this film ? A dozen ageing British actors (but unlike the usual Hollywood menu they are NOT the villans here !) and a few Norwegians plus hordes of East European extras make this boring film slightly more whimsical ... but the CGIs make up for the hilarious battle scenes.And as usual these days ... there is a 5+ minutes of credits including ""trainee"" accountants and pencil sharpeners !Don't waste your time over this, even on a rainy day !!"
" The Rock as Hercules,,, enough said!!
",0.0,0.6103,2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,"This one is good,, but if you're expecting greatness,,, keep walking. It's a good movie that's loosely based on the legend. The Rock leads a band of mercs to fight for a King looking to expand his kingdom,,,Just watch it!!"
" This movie doesn't deserve any hate for being bad cos it was never gonna be good
",-0.4419,0.3439,2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"I look at this in the same way I'd look at any movie with the rock in like fast and furious or that GI Joe sequel when it's that type of dumb action movie that has little to no story and just a load of good action with some charismatic actors to hold attention when not stabbing people, so sit back enjoy dumb action for under 2 hours.
When I first saw this movie I didn't particularly appreciate this cos of Lord of the rings mostly the specifics on why I didn't like it was the lack of mythology which was a bit lame but on a second viewing I can just enjoy dumb action and you can too, also the big battles are really well made considering not Helms Deep quality but still good and worth a watch."
" Mostly disappointing
",-0.4939,0.8515,2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Mostly disappointing, 'Hercules' fails to deliver in what should've been a thrilling action film.It's still an OK production, with a few decent qualities. Dwayne Johnson is perfect for the titular role, even if it isn't one of his best performances; the iffy wig doesn't help either. Ian McShane and Aksel Hennie are good casts, though both are a little underused throughout.I didn't like the multiple villains, especially as none of them really stand out. Away from McShane (Amphiaraus) and Hennie (Tydeus), I don't think they got the correct actors for Hercules' team - the remaining lot all slightly irritated me in different ways.The plot isn't the greatest here either. I did actually enjoy the ending in truth, it's the best part of the film... everything up to that point plods, as well as having rather obvious plot devices. The overall score could've been better, also.It all accounts for unsatisfying viewing, unfortunately."
" What could you take a point off for?
",0.0,0.765,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Classic The Rock number. Do not watch this if like fellow reviewers you're looking for ""Greek mythology"" or ""classic legend"" this is an action film, filled with funny quips, and designed to be a laugh along number.
Would go so far as to say it mocks 300, channels LOTR and is bordering slapstick at times."
" Entertainment without mindblowing storytelling
",0.4215,0.9041,2020-03-28 00:00:00,6,"If you are looking for a somewhat accurate representation of the actual legend of Hercules then keep looking. It is a good action movie with a not-too-serious tone, but the actual talk of gods adds little to the story. The theme is nothing new and draws many parallels to other movies about ancient Greece. Perhaps the movie wouldn't have suffered greatly from being longer and thus giving the characters more backstory and personality traits. But fitting to a Friday evening, when you just need entertainment."
" Hercules
",0.0,-0.0891,2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Someone had the incredibly stupid idea of showing Hercules' infamous tasks within the first five minutes and then tell a somewhat conventional story of antique battles and rebellion. The Rock is a charismatic hero and his team works, too. Without this cast this movie would have fallen to pieces. As it is, the action is decent, the result entertaining enough and thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously. But still, whoever came up with this simplistic plot should be smacked over the head."
" Big budget gone all wrong
",-0.4767,0.8868,2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Even though Hercules is a legend and not a real person, the historical accuracy is pitiful. First of all Hercules is the roman adaption of the Greek Heracles meaning that the original myth is Greek. Set in the timeframe of ancient Greece when the legend was live, it narrows time to a certain age. The weapons, the armor and above all the shields used in the movie is a mixture of both ancient Greece and ancient Rome aswell as used by the wast germanic tribes in the northern part of central Europe. I'm not demanding nor was I expecting full historical accuracy, but this is like taking inventions from more than a few centuries from a whole continent and putting them all together.As far as the story goes, not much is accurate here either. So as most often with big Hollywood productions, the scenery is great, the fighting scenes are lavish but the core is pretty much non existent."
" Great story
",0.6249,-0.5719,2020-02-10 00:00:00,10,Story is different and it works. It is worth the time and emotion from tears to anger.
" Man. Myth or a Little In-Between?
",0.0,0.9946,2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Hercules is a thoroughly good action film and I like the approach the film-makers take to their famous mythical subject. In general, a Troy (2004) interpretation is adopted, whereby everything is de-mystified and the pantheon of Olympic Gods is neither seen, nor heard. However using the intermittent vehicle of Hercules's nephew storyteller Iolaus of Athens, we do see some of his fabulous ""Labours"", that the man himself and his loyal band of followers are at pains to inform the curious, ""may have occurred"" in the past giving rise to his legendary status.The movie has good production values, the sets and locations are convincing and the action sequences are particularly noteworthy. The adoption of a ""magnificent 6"" arrangement also adds plenty of depth to the characterisations, rather than just totally focusing on the big guy. Good to see Rufus Sewell finally playing a ""good guy"" again, rather than his customary villain and I particularly liked the roles of the feral warrior Tydeus of Thebes and the Amazon archer Atalanta of Scythia, both played by Nordic actors, Aksel Hennie and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal respectively. John Hurt, Ian McShane and Joseph Fiennes add plenty of experience and depth to the support cast and it's quite interesting seeing Rebecca Ferguson in a fairly substantial support role, just prior to her ascension to international A - list fame.Overall Hercules is fast-paced, funny, and packed with plenty of eye-popping action with impressive effects. Action fans should be satisfied, as might those viewers, perhaps more interested in the Greek Mythology side of things."
" Liked it more than anticipated
",0.4215,0.9811,2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Remember those American epics from the 50s and 60s (even early 70s) into which they drafted loads of top-flight British actors in order to get beautifully-voiced delivery of erudite-sounding lines? Well, you'll get plenty of that in Brett Ratner's 2014 version (of comic-book origin) - thanks to the dulcit tones and fine screen presences of John Hurt, Joseph Fiennes and the ""lookalike dream team"" of Rufus Sewell and Ian McShane, who all deliver wise and very often witty lines in nicely-created cities and indoor settings, as well as outdoor Hungarian locations.Dwayne Johnson does absolutely well enough acting his part (yes really, it's more than just the muscle). It's then fun as we see how Hercules got by with his legendary accomplishments with more than a little help from his friends (as also played by Norwegians Aksel Hennie and Ingrid Berdal, plus further Brit Reece Ritchie, who also does well); while the debunking of centaurs as men on horses, Cerberus the three-headed dog as three separate wolves and so on is a far less deflating (far more elevating) experience than you might expect. It's also nicely summed up by closing Ian McShane comments to the effect that our poor old world needs real heroes more than the legendary exploits of gods or demigods.That also hits home more than you might imagine...The battle scenes seen on the large scale look pretty impressive, with different defensive and offensive tactics deployed in a mostly plausible way; while the body count - though astronomical - is achieved by choreographed microscale violence that avoids gore or excessive detail (the film appeared on my TV screen as a ""12"").And, as in those old epics of past decades, a great deal of emphasis is put on morality and doing the right thing - ultimately if not always immediately; as realistically padded out for the 21st century with a measure of cunning and a lot of wry humour.It's all good fun!"
" Not everyone can play every role
",-0.2584,-0.932,2020-01-11 00:00:00,4,"Let me start by saying I did not choose to watch this film. It was playing in the cardio cinema at my gym, so that is how I came across this mess of a film. I don't even know where to begin. The writing was terrible. The Rock was terribly miss cast, and is evidence that not anyone can play any role. He was totally wrong for the role of Hercules. I am a fan of his, but this was not a good role for him. The only reason I even gave it four stars is because of the acting of the other members of the cast, specifically Ian McShane and John Hurt. Had it not been for them, this would have been completely unwatchable."
" Hollywood ruining Greek mythology
",-0.25,-0.1531,2019-12-31 00:00:00,1,"When something is written perfectly as is all Greek mythology, stop ruining it and making it into i Xena the warrior princess movies.

" One more absurdity
",0.0,0.5255,2019-09-07 00:00:00,3,"Hellenic myths are beautiful and plentiful. All good moral lessons are already there, which could make us wonder why after millenia we are still aberrant.
This mockery is one other to Hollywood's collection. It begins with Heracles in Macedonia in Alexander Magnus's time! Shameless.
Sole charisma of this may come from Dwayne's humility in acting Heracles."
" Wasted!
",-0.5411,-0.2823,2019-08-08 00:00:00,3,It took too much time to take off. And when it started to fly then it was too late. Rock was great as Hercules but the screenplay really sucks.
" 2014? Really?
",0.0,0.8957,2019-08-04 00:00:00,4,While watching - gruntingly given all the creative freedom taken and subsequently abused - I commented the CGI was pretty good for a early 90's movie. Now I see it's from 2014 and must wonder; did they spend all their cash on actors alone? Not much spent on script and absolutely nothing on CGI.A good example for future generations on not how to do it.
" Cheap and nasty
",-0.5574,0.4329,2019-08-02 00:00:00,6,How can they have such a decent budget and cast yet STILL make it look like an amateur production? How?
" Great popcorn flick!
",0.6588,0.9761,2019-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Seeing The Rock do what he does best as the Demi-god hero Hercules! This isn't an Oscar worthy film which the cast and crew are acutely aware of!
This is just one BIG FUN movie! You'll cheer for Hercules and boo the bad guys!
Dwayne Johnson is the perfect actor to mutter lines like ""Do I look afraid?"" While staring into the camera while basically winking at his audience.
If you want fun and excitement this movie is for you!"
" my notes
",0.0,-0.1655,2019-06-25 00:00:00,2,"Except for a few good action parts, everything about this movie was terrible. especially the acting by the rock. not only was he an awful actor, he was the only one in the movie without an accent and it was so noticeable. in a few parts, he tried to use an accent, but only one word in the sentence would have the accent (1 viewing)"
" Very enjoyable
",0.4927,0.9663,2019-03-09 00:00:00,7,"A different role for the rock but what a job he did. Entertaining, fun and surprisingly good. My question I ask is why a surprise, the rock is my hero, but I think it's because these genre of films often don't keep my attention. But I never once turned away from the screen with a hint of boredom. Instead my head was nearly in it wanting to fight alongside the rock! You might have seen me helping the rock push that thing over near the end!"
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.5413,2019-01-18 00:00:00,8,The movie is a period movie and full credit to Dwayne Johnson for playing the role with perfection. This movie might not be as grandeur as Gladiator or as gorgeous as 300 but still this movie possesses a charm in it. The start of movie is little slow but it will not disappoint you. If not perfect then a good period drama.
" Average The Rock flick
",0.0,-0.7891,2018-12-06 00:00:00,6,This is basically what you expect out of a Hercules with The Rock in it. It's not bad and at times the fighting is actually pretty good but it seems to be unsure if it wanted to be an adult movie or a kid movie. Still overall I like what they did with the story making the slaying of the monsters more tall tales than reality and Hercules actually fighting with a group of mercenaries instead of just himself. He helps one side defeat the other but then realizes he was on the evil side and in the end redeems that.
" the rock as Hercules
",0.0,0.7184,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it is a brand-new take on Hercules. Instead of focusing on just the myth or the legend of Hercules this movie focusing more on the concept of is Hercules a human or a god. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are incredible also. Especially by the Rock as Hercules and Aksei Hennie as Tydus. The cinematography is absolutely incredible. The sets and costumes match the ancient Greek period which is also incredible. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Rock, paper, demi-god.
",0.0,0.6872,2018-11-18 00:00:00,5,"'Hercules (2014)' takes an interesting approach to its story and the mythology surrounding its central character - though it's an arguably less interesting approach than the more conventional or, rather, expected one (especially since this was the one that the trailers heavily pushed). It also has a decent lead performance from the rarely, if ever, unlikable Dwayne Johnson - or 'The Rock' (as he was still then partially known). However, neither of these things can prevent the piece from ultimately being a pretty generic, bland and almost entirely forgettable entry into the rarely engaging middle-big-budget 'fantasy-history' genre. 5/10"
" Better than the reviews
",0.4404,0.9856,2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"I liked this film. I am a history buff but petty things like names, chronologies, stirrups and lots av anachronistic details do not seem matter in this fun movie that wasn't even filmed in Greece. The Rock is pleasure to see and especially the deconstruction of the Heracles/Hercules myth is enjoyable and humorous. Good acting in this context and good cast overall.
Recommend it as is."
" Way better than expected.
",0.4404,0.9538,2018-10-30 00:00:00,8,"I remember watching the Sinbad movies, that occasionally popped up on tv in the 70s, they were well made and entertaining.
With that in mind, I was quite surprised to find how much I enjoyed this movie. The Rock does a great job flexing *and* acting as Hercules, and the supporting cast, including John Hurt help bring the action. I'd like to see this have a sequel."
" Misplaced casting?
",0.0,0.886,2018-10-06 00:00:00,6,I mean... why not try to at least find a Greek actor to play a Greek mythical character? I love the Rock but just didn't really find his portrayal convincing. The film was otherwise decent in terms of production values and script.
" Hercules without special powers
",-0.3089,-0.5784,2018-10-03 00:00:00,6,The film Hercules failed to deliver the audience the actual essence of Hercules character. He was half god as his father was Zeus and half human as his mother was a mortal woman. In the entire movie it wasn't shown anywhere that he uses the godly powers he possesses. He was shown injured and hurt like normal human do where as if you see the Hercules the legendry journeys in that tv series the Hercules was never hurt or got injured as he was half god. The audience lost the interest as he was shown as a normal human not as some super hero which was expected out of this character. Kevin Sorbo should have played the role as he looks like a Hercules and Dwayne was out of proportion for this role.
" Expected better
",0.4404,0.9671,2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Being a fan of everything that is mythological it was impossible for me not to go watch it. But I was a little disappointed, I thought the film would show us gods in other forms than statues and that there would be magic. However, Dwayne Johnson has come up quite convincing in his role (Hercules), as well as Rufus Sewell (Autolycos) and Ian McShane (Ampharios) who gives a hint of humor to this film. To summarize, Hercules is a good movie to watch with friends, I also strongly advise those who are fond of mythology (especially if they watched the Hercules serie of 1995) to watch it."
" Don't kill until you see the white of their teeth
",0.5773,0.5267,2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,The review that this is a sword and sandal movie nailed it. Beyond that what stuck out to me is how good everyone's teeth looked. Looked like a wall at an orthodontist.
" OK
",0.296,0.3182,2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Mr. Johnson is always great. There were so many other stars in the cast that I can't believe it was under my radar until it hit TV. One of my issues with the movie is the depiction of the Thracians: They were portrayed as half-naked painted barbarians with battle cries that sounded like zombies. Also, they seemed to be wielding Egyptian khopeshes instead of their traditional rhomphaias. Finally, where were the Thracians' horses, for which they were known?"
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.8742,2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Well, the movie is below average. Of course, Dwayne Johnson once again plays himself and despite the fact that he can be fun, he doesn't really fit. Only thing keeping the movie above 5 stars, is that it has the interesting thing that it implies that Hercule's labors are implied to be fiction. Frankly, there are better Hercules movies out there if you want."
" Not that incredible, but not necessary bad.
",0.5824,0.9973,2017-12-01 00:00:00,7,"Hercules is a movie all about expectations. Based on the trailer and the promotional material, it easy to assume that the movie would be about the classic story of Hercules doing his twelve labors, but this hope is rapidly broken in the movie's first minutes, which show that the myths are just lies or exaggerations spread by Hercules and his mercenary friends to benefit themselves by getting easy gold and inspiring fear. Because of that, the movie subverts what is expected from a mythological movie and transforms itself in quite a surprise. I personally enjoyed this initial twist, but I can understand the disappointment of someone that went to the theaters expecting Hercules to beat some monsters. Apart from the subversion of the premise of a normal mythological movie, like Disney's Hercules animation (which treats supernatural beings as a part of its universe), Hercules is not quite different from a conventional action movie like Fast and Furious. It has fighting scenes and, in the end, what matters is friends trusting in each other. A good part of the movie is just about The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) being The Rock, an incredible strong guy that likes to show his muscles and always does the right thing when it matters, but in this movie especially he does not see any problem in lying to get money, though. During the movie, the question about what is fiction or not is raised, just to leave the conclusion cloudy as to whether supernatural powers are something real or not in its narrative universe. Doing this in the end bothered me because it is possible to understand the movie as a generic movie in which the protagonist has super human strength and that simply negates its initial subversion of the genre of mythological movies. In addition, the most prominent message that the film brings is that narratives can be dangerous, and that they can be used to control people's opinion of an oppressor as someone good. Therefore, we need to have more sides to a history than just one and we cannot trust everything that we are told. It a good message to bring in a blockbuster movie that at seems quite unpretentious, especially in 2014, when we were not so immersed in this post-truth era of politics. In conclusion, the movie is just OK. It has an interesting premise and it is packed with enough action and comedy to be fun and bring some kind of message at the same time. It will not blow your mind, but it will certainly provide you, your friends and some popcorn with a good time."
" Average
",0.0,-0.079,2017-11-23 00:00:00,5,It isn't good.It isn't bad.It is just kind of there in the middle.The Rock as Hercules is genius casting because apart from looking the part he is one of the most charismatic actors working today and that's just about it. The movie never really sticks the landing with it's story and never gets you emotionally attached to its characters.If you looking for a Hercules adaptation you could do worse *coughs* (legend of hercules more like legend of abominational filmmaking Im I right?)
" Wish I watched it sooner. Great flick.
",0.7783,0.9774,2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"Hercules I can not believe it took me this long to finally watch this because I love the Rock and I love action. Anyway, this is one of those great action films you can watch at any age and enjoy. However it is the type you movie you have to watch completely to get the full effect because the last 20 minutes are where the film really pays off with all the set pieces in place. Great family film and a great film in general."
" Oh, Dwayne
",0.0,0.9031,2017-07-11 00:00:00,6,"I may have liked this movie years ago had I not seen Gladiator. And Troy. And Thor. And 300. I really like Dwayne Johnson and a few of his movies--Walking Tall, Snitch, The Rundown--but the excellent supporting cast (e.g, Rufus Sewell, John Hurt, Joseph Fiennes) did not make up for his acting in Hercules. He may not get nominated for Oscar, but he's capable of better acting. Movies in this sub-genre have become cliché, and this narrative of the mythological character was rather predictable."

I watched it in 3D which definitely had added a point or two since that was done well. However, the movie itself was just lacking something. They had a great cast. No complaints on the acting. The script was a bit too corny at times. IMO if they would have stayed on task with just blending the myth with the history and not tried to force any silly dialogue in this movie would have been a classic. That and maybe added a bit more intensity ad length to the battle scenes. Many scenes just seem to get cut short. I know there is a director's cut that is just a little bit longer but I' not thinking the few extra minutes are going to make this one. This is not a waste of time by any means. Enjoy it as a simple sword and fantasy movie. Just don't have your expectations set for an iconic epic."
" The 'Truth' about Hercules...
",0.0,0.9906,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"I was galvanized by this movie! I remember the trailer. I was eagerly licking my chops in anticipation of viewing it soon. Unfortunately, life gets in the way, and it is only now that I can report finally viewing it in its entirety. Regardless of the liberties taken with the Mythos of the Son of Zeus, I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the Hercules tale.The beginning was great and called to mind the paintings done by the great Frank Frazetta for the Conan and Tarzan covers. The visual appeal of the opening sequence is so exhilarating that afterwards you are ready for the holes being inevitably poked into the fabric of the Hercules legend. This is for the adults, who, unlike children, cannot take things at face value and must bring logic and 'facts' into the fun. Compared to the graphic novel, by Steve Moore, the look and the feel of the film is a decided improvement. When Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his first appearance in the opening scene wearing a lion's head as a helmet, he looks just like the character I read about in a children's book when I was seven years old. Face it, in Hollywood, looks are everything. This explains the enduring appeal of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman. The fact that she actually looked like the comic book character come to life at times towered over such trivialities as character and plot development. Here Dwayne Johnson embodies the character in his own way much as did the late great Steve Reeves. You believe he is the real Hercules no matter what is said about him and his adventures.I remember watching 'ZENA: THE WARRIOR PRINCESS' and reading later in TV GUIDE how it took half a dozen ladies of similar appearance to Lucy Lawless to create the Warrior Princess myth. Lucy did all the acting; especially in the tight closeups; but there was an alternate Lucy for the swimming scenes, a Lucy for the jousting and sword fighting scenes, even a Lucy for the bareback riding and crucifixion scenes. The point being it took a whole team of people to create the legend of 'ZENA: THE WARRIOR PRINCESS'! This is the point with this version of 'Hercules', I believe. Here we have a warrior of unusual strength who goes around with his own myth-making machine. The sundry details of his labors and adventures are dubious and moot. But the hyperbolic way in which he is 'presented' to his 'public' is Hollywood merchandising mocking itself with a knowing wink. This is a Hollywood Hercules before there even was a Hollywood; and as Kirk Douglas used to chide John Wayne, yes, it may be true that he did not really kill all those Indians, but still, he sure packs a hell of a wallop in a bar fight.Let me not mislead you. I'm not writing this to convince you there is something profound or philosophical going on here in this movie. Quite the contrary. What I do like about it is the light play between fact and public relations. We are told at the end of the story that this is the 'truth' about Hercules. But you get the feeling that even this is to be taken with a grain of salt, because somebody may be carefully parking their tongue in their cheek for popcorn and ticket sales."
