" Wonderful movie!
",0.6114,0.9569,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I caught this movie on some basic cable channel one rainy afternoon when I was stuck at home. What a great surprise! Very well written story/script by Jim Strouse, and very well directed by John Krasinski (who also plays the lead character very well) Richard Jenkins is also spot on brilliant with his performance as the patriarch of 'the Hollars family) Sharlto Copley is also very cool in this movie. Highly recommended!"

Despite the negativities by some, it is just how life goes, sometimes. It wasn't too far fetched from reality (for the most part)."

",-0.6801,0.9246,2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"This is basically a big screen Lifetime movie which I'm giving an extra star because Margo Martindale is always a joy to watch and Josh Ritter's music choices (including plenty of his own recordings) add a bit to what is a nominally interesting sentimental feature. Written and directed by men, Anna Kendrick and Mary Elizabeth Whitstead (one scene) are given little to do, as is way too common even in these supposedly enlightened days."

Small town / big town differences. Growing up, adulting and finding your place in life. No car chases here but a terrific film with some serious good laughs. Takes a bit of a heavy turn right before the end but ends on a high note. Cast is great too. Loved it!"

When anybody, I mean literally ANYBODY can make an uplifting, funny, inspirational movie about your mom dying, your dad breaking down and losing his job, then you have TRULY mastered the skills of film making, because anyone who can tell a sad, SAD story, with so MUCH joy and laughter, deserves my fullest, my deepest SYMPATHY.The good: this is NOT a straightforward comedy, but the jokes arise out of vulnerability, out of shame, out of weakness and sickness. Your mom is dying, your father is breaking down and still this movie is TRULY through and through funny and TRUE to LIFE and INSPIRATIONAL.Only 6 stars on Imdb? COME ON!!! This is comedy at it's finest. With the best acting performances. With the most endearing, gentle LOVE FOR FAMILY being portrayed. Drama / Comedy masterpiece. I love it........"

" Ed Burns for the modern era
",0.0,0.3612,2019-09-25 00:00:00,7,A John Krasinski film that a majority of people may not have heard of. Watching this makes me think a the younger Ed Burns films that are simple and about family and the common things we take for-granted in like.

" Watchable little film about real-life
",0.0,0.977,2019-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Real people going through real life problems. That's what this film felt like. Despite the short runtime, I felt connected to these characters by the end of it. I laughed, I cried, I felt annoyed. Such is life.Some of the characters felt a bit too close to home. But I think that might just be the point. The Hollars could be any family out there, and here they were experiencing things we all do in life. Sometimes it's just kind of comforting to see others being normal human beings - even just in fictionalized movies.If you're wanting an escape from every day life - this film probably isn't for you. Because it takes every day life and shoves it in your face, warts n' all. I wish the storyline took certain turns where it didn't, but that was out of my control - much like life itself is.The often annoying Anna Kendrick was great in this, as were the rest of the cast.""..the best thing you've ever done for me

But there are too many problems...
The giant tumor, the bad relationship with Ros and his ex wife, twins, the company going bankrupt, the dad suddenly working somewhere, the graphic novel that we don't fully seem to ""see""
And then pouf...
She dies, the son returns to the family business, funeral and it ends with Becca going into labour.
There were so many things unresolved...
Maybe a several months later would've fixed a lot :)"

" Quirky and endearing
",0.0,0.9894,2017-11-23 00:00:00,8,"I adored this movie! It enriched my evening last night. I didn't have any expectations going into it. I figured I'd like it because of the great cast--and that is a small part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much.I enjoyed how the characters never took themselves too seriously-- and the message behind this movie for me is you really shouldn't take yourself and life too seriously because then it's too heavy to carry around all the time. The movie was endearing to me because Sally and Don remind me so much of my grandparents whom I admire greatly. Don calling Sally ""chief,"" is much like one of several nicknames my grandaddy called my mama (What I've always referred to them as). Their playful and joking personalities are similar to my grandparents too, so I really felt like I was with both of them again.This is great family viewing for the reasons I've mentioned. I think adults and kids will both get some enjoyment out of this film. Plus, Charlie Day is Charlie Day in it--and everything you'd expect from John Krasinski is delivered. Watch it please!!!"
" Family Comedy with Heart
",0.3612,0.7184,2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,Directed by and starring John Krasinski this family comedy with a few tears hits all the right marks.From family fisticuffs in the hospital room to indulging mom's sweet tooth for dipping pretzels into ice cream for breakfast - this family has got a lot of heart.The family rallies when Sally Hollar begins having seizures and needs brain surgery. What follows is a family coming back together and smoothing out misunderstandings. There are zany madcap moments that will make you laugh and cry. Worth a view.
" Great cast, Alright Story...
",0.7269,0.9931,2017-10-29 00:00:00,5,"The movie began feeling like there wasn't a proper introduction into the first few characters, I expected it do go deeper through out the movie but felt like it lacked the connection with the audience.There were some slightly funny moments where I would find myself with a smile & cracking a little laugh but I could feel it would end with heartache, if not by death of the mother than a relationship break down with John Hollar (John Krasinski) & Rebecca (Anna Kendrick).There was a brief love triangle thing going on with Johns old girlfriend, with her new husband, Jason (Charlie Day) being Johns Mums nurse at the hospital, the first interaction with John & Jason was funny & was confusing for John who ended up being invited over for dinner after being accused of still having feeling for his old girlfriend.Over all, it felt like some story lines were briefly touched on but weren't explored any further.With a sad but sweet ending, I would still recommend watching this movie if you enjoy dramas & especially with this lovely cast."
" don't like Ron
",-0.2755,-0.9612,2017-10-07 00:00:00,4,Ron Hollar (Sharlto Copley) is an adult son living in the family home with his parents Don (Richard Jenkins) and Sally (Margo Martindale). Ron is recently fired from the failing family business. He stalks his ex-wife Stacey who is moving on with reverend Dan (Josh Groban). They have two kids together. Sally suffers a seizure and Dr. Fong (Randall Park) diagnoses a brain tumor. John (John Krasinski) returns home from NYC after receiving the news from his pregnant girlfriend Rebecca (Anna Kendrick). Jason (Charlie Day) is a hospital nurse who still holds a grudge and married to John's ex Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) with a baby.I really don't like Sharlto Copley. His character starts off by peeing in a bottle in the kitchen. It's off-putting without being funny. His character is entirely annoying without being funny. Almost everybody is a little annoying without being funny. I wonder if Charlie Day could be funnier as Ron. This is John Krasinski's feature directorial debut. I get his intention of a quirky dark comedy indie. I didn't get much comedy and the indie is all too familiar.
" Full of laughs and tears
",0.3182,0.9637,2017-09-03 00:00:00,8,"'The Hollars' is a beautiful film that everyone should watch. It's perfect if you want to watch a comedy or a drama and there really is a lot of meaning and emotion allowing every person to get attached even for a little bit with the characters. I wanted it to watch it from the first time it came out but unfortunately it never came to my local movie theater, but when I finally watched it I realized that it was worth waiting. I can understand why someone can say that is not anything special the truth is that there is nothing particularly exciting in it but there is nothing particularly bad either and that's good enough for me. As a fan of Anna Kendrick this movie was one of the few that I really saw her shine and she showed the audience that she can do just as good in a dramatic part. Totally recommend it to everyone !"
" Predictable, cliché-ridden indie family dramedy with a great cast
",0.6249,0.9932,2017-06-18 00:00:00,4,"If you were to create a spoof of independent family dramedies, it might share a lot in common with ""The Hollars."" That's not to knock the relatable, familiar and big-hearted intentions of writer Jim Strouse and director/star John Krasinski (""The Office""), but their movie is rife with not just clichés, but the most obvious clichés. Most people could guess what will happen after witnessing just the first 20 minutes.Like so many films before it, a major family occurrence brings the main character, in this case John Hollar (Krasinski), home from his big city life to his middle America hometown and into old and challenging dynamics. That inciting incident is news that mama Sally Hollar (Margo Martindale) has been diagnosed with an advanced brain tumor. Each Hollar takes the news differently, and it turns out that's not all they have to contend with; patriarch Don's (Richard Jenkins) family business is failing and older brother living at home, Ron (Sharlto Copley), is crossing the line with his ex-wife and two daughters. Oh, and John's girlfriend (Anna Kendrick) is eight months pregnant.Strouse's story doesn't just embrace clichés, it leans into them. John has to face his high school sweetheart (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and her high-strung boyfriend (Charlie Day) who ""happens"" to be his mom's nurse; Ron contends with his ex's seemingly perfect youth pastor boyfriend (Josh Groban); Sally has emotional trouble shaving her head in preparation for her surgery. And that's without mentioning the pregnant girlfriend. No character's behavior, circumstances or outcome comes as any surprise.In spite of it all, the film attracted all these terrific names in the parentheses above, and they lift Strouse's script about as high as it can go. The moments of the film that work work because of the talent. Krasinski does not offer much as a director to tell this story in a way that extends beyond the banal framework of the family that contends with big feelings and comes together in the face of adversity.""The Hollars"" will surely find fans in viewers who enjoy recognizable on-screen talent in a movie that's story safely goes where they want it to go, with its ""profound"" moments punctuated by indie folk music. Sure, the reason filmmakers started making movies like this in the first place was because there was something real, honest and tangible about this setup, and ""The Hollars"" touches these same universal themes and feelings. But Strouse's script feels more like a smattering of conveniently chosen archetypes, scenarios and personality traits weaved together to create that story instead of finding its own voice.Especially considering the talents of Krasinski, Kendrick, Jenkins, Martingale, etc. the lack of originality creates a staggering amount of apathy for their characters and the cookie-cutter ups and downs of the story. There's something bizarre about seeing moments in this film that are well-acted and come from such a sincere place, but feel empty because they go down exactly as you'd expect a movie to draw them up. Empathy requires novel moments in which viewers feel compelled to put themselves in a character's shoes. ""The Hollars"" proves that the key word in that formula is ""novel,"" because if we've already pondered all of these exact predicaments depicted in a film, it's not so exciting to put on that old pair of shoes, even when they offer some familiar comforts.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" ""The Hollars"" deserves to be seen
",0.0,0.3284,2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"Here's another example of a terrific film that wasn't given proper exposure by the industry. The four leads--Krasinski, Copley, Jenkins, and the amazing Martindale--are perfect, and completely convincing as a family facing crisis. In spite of the somber subject matter (it's geared toward adults, not children), director Krasinski successfully wrings both chuckles and tears from these performances. It's a shame that ""The Hollars"" didn't garner some of the Oscar nominations that went to bigger-budget, but less deserving, films in 2016."
" I would recommended more
",0.2023,-0.4036,2017-05-06 00:00:00,6,"This movie has good acting first of all, a story that can happen to all humans, is 'nt boring at all - in spite of the sad theme of mother's illness. I was watching it with enough interest then came the scene where ill mother escapes with her son to have a dinner outside at a restaurant, celebrating the next day's operation. On the other hand, the end seems real, brings in mind, the well known saying, hope dies last! Anyway, I think, this movie has some bizarre writing details. We see comforting son, saying that is tired, or has enough, from his relationship and afterwards, admitting that he loves and wants to be together! Surely, the dialogues are good enough, but somewhere control over reality is getting lost - or is reality sometimes, so contradictory?"
" We Are Family!
",0.0,0.9963,2017-05-02 00:00:00,9,"John Krasinski's 'The Hollars' is all heart. And that's precisely why this family-dramaedy shines so bright. With Krasinski calling the shots & acting in one hand, along-with an ensemble ready to leave you awe-inspired on the other, its hard to refuse 'The Hollars', despite its predictable plot.'The Hollars' Synopsis: A man returns to his small hometown after learning that his mother has fallen ill and is about to undergo surgery.'The Hollars', for all it stands for, is about Family & Love. Where would one be without a Family? The Hollars are flawed, but that's how us Humans work, amidst this ride called ""LIFE"". Krasinski treats the narrative with realism & makes sure you have a smile on your face once this story concludes. I liked The Hollars, all of them, this family of four, full of madness, secrets, regrets, but above-all, there for one another at its most crucial moments. Krasinski is self-assured at his job here & his Direction is skillfully done. He has the knack of a true filmmaker! James C. Strouse's Writing is strong. The emotions bloom out beautifully & the humor, though brief, works wonders whenever its put in. Cinematography is first-class. Editing is neatly done. Art & Costume Design are good.Performance-Wise: Krasinski is a fine actor & 'The Hollars' is a yet another reminder of that fact. He's nicely restrained in the central role. Richard Jenkins & Margo Martindale are Acting Jewels. Jenkins is faultless as the overtly emotional, subtly devastated Hollar Sr., who doesn't miss a single beat. Martindale, meanwhile, steals the show! In a role that demands a performer of true merit, Martindale chews on the character & offers soul in abundance. Sharlto Copley is in form after a long time. He shines here. Anna Kendrick is natural to the core, as always. Charlie Day can do better for himself in the world of acting, as he's marvelous here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cute in a small cameo. Randall Park is decent. On the whole, 'The Hollars' is a Winner. This one's right from the heart, made with a genuine sense of feeling."
" waited a few days
",0.0,0.9293,2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"Before I wrote this review because I wanted it to settle in. I won't say amazing, but I will say pretty damn good. Richard Jenkins, Margo Martindale (who doesn't get the credit she deserves) and Anna Kendrick (hot and a great actress, and, no, I don't care what you think) all shone in this movie...Krasinski was, of course, going to be the weak link. Another guy who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. But he can be ignored, as he should be (yeah, I know he directed it, but I feel it was the kind of direction where he's asking the real actors,""What do you think I should do here?""). The brother was a nice evolution...even the nurse (the little guy from Always Sunny in Philadelphia) was a fun tangent. Watch it..you'll be pleasantly surprised."
" Not a comedy as advertised
",-0.2755,0.9768,2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Don't be fooled by the categorisation of the film on the In Flight Entertainment channel. It's not just a comedy as advertised but a honest, tear jerking yet funny and thought provoking film. The honesty of the movie has me examined my relationship with my own parents - have I spend enough time with them? care about them as much I should? The love and marriage the older Hollars have is something we should all want and work towards to. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters - bringing them to life, making my heart wrench with what is happening to them and having me invested all 90 minutes to find out how the story pans out in the end.Highly recommend watching this if you're tired of watching all the big money Hollywood films and is looking for something refreshing to watch."
" A Different But Not Unusual Portrayal Of A Family
",0.0,0.2732,2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"I liked the family portrayals of the leading characters in this film. They were gritty, erratic, whimsical, maudlin...in a sense they covered the gamut of emotions of a struggling lower middle class family from a small town.Its one that many viewers can relate too and conversely perhaps many can't--or wont, regarding the Hollars as 'losers'. Its a slice of life presentation and well worth an evening's viewing."
" Amusing enough
",0.3818,0.9736,2017-03-10 00:00:00,6,"I could nitpick and find a trillion faults with this movie. The direction lacks any sort of inspiration, letting the viewer actually ""feel"" the passive way Krasinski chooses to go about treating the all-star cast. Thankfully, most of the actors seem to know what they're doing so, albeit lukewarm directorially, the performances somewhat save the day.My opinion, unless he seriously ups his game, JC really needs to keep his front-of-camera day job and leave the technicalities to those with a more creative eye. Onwards.The writing is inconsistent, varying from incoherent to brilliant which, let's just say is not good for those with short attention spans. Like a screenwriter's hoarding wasteland, the plot is crammed with all sorts of random subplots that add nothing to the story, ultimately resulting in frustrating loose ends - so be prepared to invest and be disappointed.Now, for the surprise. I actually enjoyed this movie. Emotional manipulation, forced drama and all, on the back of the magnificent chemistry between Martindale and Jenkings, Krasinski's dead-pan despondence, Day's irrational wit, and Kendrick's refreshingly grounded performance, I was thoroughly entertained. The movie offers quite a few pieces of quotable dialogue and peppered with humorous lacings, certain melodramatic sequences that border on the twee never quite tip over to the cringe-inducing side, keeping the drama basic but real.All said and done, this would have been a two-star, forgettable annoyance, yet it somehow succeeded in gripping my attention enough for me to enjoy the otherwise menial material.From me, three stars and never forget that Margo Martindale is one of the great ones."
" When the family needs you the most...
",0.0,0.997,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm not saying this is the best film of the year, because there are plenty of better films than this, but in some way this film wins our heart. First of all I did not know John Krasinski directs films. In fact, this is his second feature film, the only one I have seen and I loved it. The main reason to I enjoy it was, it is sentimental. Not just some foolish melodrama, but an uplifting film filled with lots of fun.The cast was at its best. I liked everyone and their unique display. At some point it feels like a realistic drama, but those comedies make us realise that it's only a film. Margo Martindale was really awesome. I have never seen her in such a wonderful role. Most importantly in an important role like this one. If I remember this film in the future, that's only for her. The only negative about the film was the twist. It was like they aimed for it to bring change in pace and atmosphere, when the situation in the story was not in its favour. Even though I did not care it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.This is the story of the Hollar family who reunite when they needed for each other. When John comes to know his mother got ill, he immediately flies back home. His brother is already there and the father is financially struggling. With many struggles, they all prepare for the medical procedure. In the meantime, there are some outside adventures. Like meeting their old friends, places, ex-wife et cetera. The remaining of the film is to reveal how it all goes and where they will stand.The target audience is mainly the families. If you like a tearjerker, you would enjoy watching it as well. So in my opinion, this film is under-rated and under-noticed. Mainly because of the cast is not so popular and so the lack of promotion. Even the film poster is not that impressive. Kind of looks like a B movie and of course it is, but an awesome B movie. Worth a watch for many reasons and you will know it when you give it a try. So, recommended.8/10"
