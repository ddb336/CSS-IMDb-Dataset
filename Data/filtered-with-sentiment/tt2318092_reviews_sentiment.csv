" Best love movie
",0.8555,0.9552,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie just makes me the happiest person alive, I love everything about this movie, the soundtrack, actors and story is just amazing, I could watch this movie for ever and never get tired of it!"
" This really is a gooden!
",0.0,0.9759,2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,"Okay, I know the movie title is a little lame but this is a really great movie! It's so cute, it's got the drama and it's got an awesome soundtrack. Not to mention, Alex Pettyfer is a fox! This movie should've been bigger, it's still a fav of mine even in 2020"
" Cheated.
",-0.5106,0.7506,2020-12-29 00:00:00,3,"Endless Love is overly sentimental and entirely unconvincing, though not completely without its moments.Characters are poor and neither of the leads ever make an impression. Greenwood's character far too excessive as well."
" Bland remake with lots of running
",0.0,0.8179,2020-09-06 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure what happened here... if this was meant to be a remake of the dark, obsessive love story with Brooke Shields from 1981 it failed completely. This remake quoted as a romantic drama where ""passion meets tragedy"" watches more like a Nicolas Sparks romance; angsty, clichéd, simple star-crossed lovers, very cookie cutter, high school melodrama.Storyline follows a privileged but sheltered girl who falls in love with a broody but handsome working class boy and how her disapproving father conspires to keep them apart. Meh.To me the movie was actually more about the dad, Bruce Greenwood. He steals all the scenes from his young co-stars as we watch him go off the rails because of his inability to deal with grief, let go of the past and overprotectiveness of his family. Redemption comes at a cost.Honorable mention to Gabriella Wilde as Jade Butterfield who managed to amuse/annoy me with her perpetual running. The girl never walks anywhere, she's like a waif flowerchild, running and dancing in little dresses, waving her arms about."
" Mediocre at best
",0.6369,0.8658,2019-11-21 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, even calling it mediocre is probably too much. The only thing of worth is Gabriella Wilde, the girl is insanely beautiful and that's worth a few extra points in my book."
" Wrong arm
",-0.4767,0.6369,2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,After the concert Jade's wristband is on the other arm. While they are in the back of the pickup truck. Where David writes I love you
" worst thing ever
",-0.6249,-0.7311,2018-12-03 00:00:00,1,I usually love cheesy romantic films but oh boy this was the worst piece of s**t i have ever seen i think i lost about 8000 brain cells after watching this
" BE GENTLE. IT'S MY FIRST TIME AND THE FLOOR BOARDS SQUEAK,
",0.4404,0.9921,2018-10-18 00:00:00,5,"No one ever talked to Jade (Gabriella Wilde) while she was in high school because she was too beautiful and too rich. David (Alex Pettyfer), who has never talked to her, likes her as they speak for the first time as he parks their family car at the country club. Soon she joyously loses her virginity by the fireside. Her home has magical floor boards that squeak when you walk on them, but not when you make love on them. Be gentle it's my first time and the floor boards squeak.Her mom (Joely Richardson) is supportive of their relationship. Dad (Bruce Greenwood) is not. The evil Dad schemes for Jade to be a doctor and go to Brown University. David, who is intelligent, plans on taking over his dad's (Robert Patrick) garage and hopefully he can stop punching a time clock.This is a not a guy's film. Grown ups running around with sparklers? Falling in love forever on a first meeting. Having your first sex somewhere besides an automobile. Daughter not knowing what a jerk her dad is after living with him for 18 years. A mechanic with smooth hands. Seriously Shana?This is a one star film for guys, 10 stars for women. Please ladies, don't make your man sit through this one forcing him not to chuckle while you have a Puffs moment.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb near end. Implied love making. Brief sheer fabric nudity. Were her straps still on her shoulder while laying down after she took the garment off?"
" Not bad for a guilty pleasure watch
",0.8352,0.9643,2018-05-27 00:00:00,6,"5/26/18. Since I didn't see the original movie that this movie was supposedly a remake of, I can't really compare them. So, based on its own merits, it wasn't too bad of a love story of a rich girl in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Wilde makes for an attractive upper class girl in love with the very attractive working class Pettyfer. Wilde's father, played from Greenwood, is obsessed with controlling the lives of his two surviving teens after losing another son to cancer. So, Class plays a role in this young couple's lives, but only because the father is so racked with guilt that he becomes unbearably controlling what he really can't control. Not bad for a guilty pleasure watch."
" Actually good movie
",0.4404,0.7703,2018-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Even though the story is cliche because in every movie there is a father that doesn't like his daughter to be with some boy,i still think that this movie is worth watching.
I cried the first time i've seen it and untill now its third time i'm watching it.
I'm not a type who likes romantic movie but definitely yes,it was a good movie."
" wanna be Notebook
",0.0,0.8719,2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"it's poor version of Notebook, they copied almost everything, but couldn't make such a good and realistic lovestory like in Notebook. there are many scenes which feels so cliché and unbelievable, maybe actors aren't as good as in Notebook, maybe script, or both of them. Though actors are really beautiful and I liked one thing that was added not like Notebook, she has brother and it's good character!"
