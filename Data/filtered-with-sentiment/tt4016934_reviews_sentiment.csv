" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9756,2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This was very satisfying throughout, it got better as it went along, the way the story got told is one of the main things that made this film unique, I would recommend this and not the extended cut. Mystery, romantic, funny, disturbing, beautiful and engaging, especially with the two main leads, the music is great and it adds so much to the film. Don't watch it with your parents. Everything I saw in the film felt it had a purpose to be there, definitely want to check out more of this director's work in the future."
" A Sharp Picture
",0.0,0.9816,2021-04-05 00:00:00,7,"A very sharp picture. Loved the way it conveyed and made us notice tension where it wasn't the ""in your face"" kind. Using smaller side plots, twists and emotions that act as release valves throughout the film rather than a final release of tension is something this film does. While this looks all too nice at first, it puts the pace of the story in an awkward position when there is no final kick to end it all. The visuals were good but at most scenes they weren't that special. Really liked how the director told us the story in a way that it moved on our reactions. While this is good for the first couple of twists and turns, it hinders the story when the audience gets tired on the long run. The whole film felt more like an American Classic, like the Great Gatsby, in its Storytelling rather than a Japanese drama at first but it slowly turned sour as the story commenced. The whole love and death theme was also well-done. The most highly noticeable thing that I don't like is probably the timing of the themes. In this matter, some are underdone and raw while others are overdone and burnt. This is caused by the far too many turns arcs in the story. Good watch overall."
" Mesmerizing..
",0.0,0.9719,2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie has a unique plot and contains a few shocking plot-twists. However, it also is an overly sexual, weird movie which in my opinion was unnecessary and makes the movie quite ""unrecommendable"". You should definitely see this movie, but you should watch it alone. I do think that this movie would have been more successful internationally, if it hat been toned down a bit.All in all, a unique movie with a fantastic plot. If you like movies like Shutter Island you will probably love this one."

" The uncle must be the director of the film
",0.0,-0.9631,2021-03-10 00:00:00,6,"They probably thought if we show full-blown gay sex on the screen with a historical background, we can collect all the awards including the Oscar just like Parasite did. But it thankfully didn't seem to work. It took on a vulgar tone at times as it went too over the top with the sex scenes with an underage looking girl looking right in the camera with her mouth covered in vaginal secretion. They got rid of the man and the uncle got him back and tortured him while he's smoking the poisonous cigarette in the basement where the uncle had also killed the aunt and set it up to make it look like a suicide by hanging. People kept talking about the twist at the end and I can assure you there's no twist whatsoever. Both women tricked each other with the man at first and when his lady wanted to hang herself in the cherry tree, the two united against the man. She got out of the asylum and met the girl who poisoned his drink and made her sleep at the hotel room. That was it. They all wanted to be Japanese at the time because being Korean was not as attractive and that's the takeaway of the movie I assume."
" A masterpiece.
",0.6249,0.9868,2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Ask me to name a perfect movie, and I'll say The Handmaiden, directed by Park Chan-wook. I watched this last year during the first few months of the pandemic and it took me on a rollercoaster. It's a 2016 film, and the fact that I hadn't known about it sooner was pain. But to be fair, I was definitely not of age to watch this in 2016 as it does have quite graphic sensual scenes.Everything about this movie is breathtaking. The design, costume, score, characterization, and the cinematography are, not to sound too fancy or pretentious but immaculate.Just like Parasite by Bong Joon-ho, this movie has its own twists and turns. The craftsmanship involved in making this movie makes it extremely effortless for the audience to enjoy the plot. One element that I enjoyed the most was the movie's pacing; Chan-wook's direction for the movie was a genius move. The movie is divided into three acts; the transitions from one style to the next was well thought of, everything was smooth.With that being said, It's not a movie for everyone. It's an erotic thriller with a dark humor sprinkled on top but Chan-wook balances those so well that it prevents the audience from being too distracted. Even when using the words erotica and thriller to describe the movie, it is in no doubt that this was crafted and executed so well that it is such an aesthetically pleasing movie to me. Some parts of the movie might be a little too much for some people but for myself, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for two and a half hours."

" What you don't see is what you get
",0.0,0.9418,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Wonderful trick and play with the audience in very beautiful pictures and great performances, a bit slowly told (typical arthouse) but once the revelations of the second act kick in, suspense increases, even though the end is ultimately predictable. Not sure why the erotic had to be so explicit, but then again it's a bold statement of two women finding love and shelter in one another that helps them fight a gruesome male-dominated environment and seek new purpose in life."
" Sexy, sharp, and stunning
",0.7184,0.9952,2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,"This is undeniably one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. It takes the best aspects of your favorite films and directors and puts it into a deliciously show stopping package. It is the sharp societal commentary of Parasite. The creativity and absurdity of Oldboy. The fun of Tarantino. The shock of a Fincher film.The film is shot gorgeously. The cinematographer had an absolute field day putting the shots together for this. The set design is immaculate. The writing is witty but easy to follow for someone reading subtitles. The colors of the film are a little uninspired but particular scenes looked absolutely fantastical.Without spoiling the plot of the film, I will say that the plot is mostly classical, although the execution is masterpiece level creative. It is an absolute joy to watch even when the next 10 minutes are spelled out for you.The pacing is fantastic, although the film slows down significantly just after the halfway point. This isn't necessarily a problem, as this lowered momentum is used as set up time for the closing act.If nothing else, this film has some ICON scenes that took me straight to my core. These are scenes like ""luke, I am your father"" or the end of the usual suspects which make us love cinema.Park has shown that he is one of the greatest in the world at his craft."
" Another korean masterpiece with mind blowing twists.
",0.6249,0.9009,2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"First you may think the genre of this movie is drama.But as the time passes on you will start to getting twist.New twists in every 20 minutes.Director had done a Precious work like his other movies.A awesome combination of drama,thriller,romance.Give it a try you wont be bore."
" Disgusting pervertion.
",-0.5267,0.1145,2021-02-09 00:00:00,1,"This film made me sick. It has tons of sex, about 15 sex scenes in total. It has all sorts of sex like softcore, hardcore, lesbian, rape, bondage, incest, underage, virgin, rape (half of these should be in quotes, but still). This film is a pervert's fantasy. It is almost 3 hours long (extended edition) and about 1/3 of content is just sex. The story is slightly interesting and has some good ideas, but the film is just not worth it. Movies like this should be on pornographic sites, not on festivals or cinema."

" Absolutely forgettable
",0.0,0.736,2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Part 1 is an extremely boring tale about a girl who wants to trick her mistress. Part 2 is the same extremely boring stuff from the mistress's point of view. The director then spices the whole thing with some lesbian sex scenes (he obviously saw ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" and tried to copy that movie for the sex), which are the most boring thing in the movie. There is a little bit of sadism but for that see ""Audition"" instead which is a great film. And Part 3 has some twists, lots of plot holes and is completely forgettable. Overall, the biggest question about this movie how it got to the list of top ranked movies."
" An amazing movie

" Huge fan of Chan-wook Park but this is just tripe
",0.3182,0.9756,2020-12-03 00:00:00,4,"So many previously good films, mostly revenge based. I even love the Drummer Girl series so after reading some great reviews I watched it with subtitles.After a slow start I was still hooked and kept slogging my way through this and when I finally finished I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. I can't recommend this to anyone. The extended graphic sex scenes don't serve the story at all and are just for ratings. How can anyone not see this is beyond me. The story is barely there and predictable after 30 minutes.I think that because there are Korean and Japanese languages spoken, rather well I'm told, that this movie gets a boost. Another boost for nudity and a bit of revenge. It's a 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses. I rate it a 4 because I'm expecting a good quality film from a respected director, who doesn't need to make soft core porn to increase his audience. It's a major let down and prevents his other films from being noticed."
" Mostly a bore
",-0.25,-0.5052,2020-11-25 00:00:00,6,"Far too much gratuitous sex. Interesting story line but focussed far too much on the sex. For the most part, a waste of 2.5 hours."

The Handmaiden is an absolute masterpiece with an incredibly intelligent narrative structure and a mysterious atmosphere that is second to none.
I can definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that deviates from the classic norm."

I truly don't know how his mastery of story telling came about, it cannot be film school, he was born with this incredible gift. Anyways, I have watched this film four times over the years to truly grasp things I missed. It's an immensely beautiful tale and all I can say it is watch it."
" Park Chan Wook is great, but I thought this was ok
",0.6542,0.9568,2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"Maybe it's because it was put on a pedestal as ""one of the best thrillers"" and by the 8.1 on IMBD, but I thought this was just ok.Sure, the cinematography is great, acting is really well-done, but I don't see it being an 8. It was good, but something is missing. I expected a bigger ""twist"" or something at the end. However, that didn't happen. I dunno, I was disappointed.If your into lesbian sex, you'll love it. I'm not knocking it, but erotic thriller isn't what I expected. I expected a psychological powerhouse. However, the movie provides only one ""Ohhhh"" moment.6.5"

None other movie I've seen have so many twists and the twists are really subtle!
Slow paced movie, divided into 2 parts (within the movie) with 3 major twists!

The way this story arc is constructed is just SUBLIME to me: well thought trough, well carried out. I was not prepared for these many twists and turns! Throughout the different parts/sections we withness the story from different perspectives centered around the two main female characters... I was impressed with how much visual perfections the change of perspective is carried out! A lot is told through visuals - sublime cinematography as well. I am overwhelmed by the beauty and detail and perfection of this movie!"
" Knocks it out of the (Chan-wook) Park.
",0.0,0.9364,2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"A loose adaptation of 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters, Park Chan-wook's 'The Handmaiden (2016)' is a layered and subversive thriller that very much feels like a novel brought to life. It's a film that knows exactly how to handle its audience, revealing only what it needs to for the current status-quo to be compelling. Its twists and turns come at the exact right moments, leading to a satisfyingly unpredictable experience that only gets deeper with each new revelation. The subject matter is darker than you might initially imagine; it deals with themes of domestic imprisonment, abuse, grooming and pre-video-tape pornography. It's also, even at its core, a romance. The relationship that blossoms between the eponymous handmaiden and her originally eponymous lady (the Korean release is named after the latter) is what fuels the narrative. Much has been made of their graphic yet restrained (though still very 'movie') sex scenes, but it's their budding sensuality and genuine connection that makes the pair believable. They're good, somewhat understated characters that keep you invested in the picture. This adds a layer of emotional resonance to the otherwise plot-heavy affair. The flick just grips you and doesn't let go. It has a palpable texture to it and it takes you on an unexpected journey. It's one of Park's best efforts. 8/10"
" Watch it for the story alone!
",-0.3164,0.9969,2020-08-28 00:00:00,9,"This was my introduction to Park Chan-wook. I honestly cannot wait to see his previous films because The Handmaiden was awesome.The Handmaiden shows a woman who is hired to be a handmaiden to a heiress but is secretly there to defraud her.Just the story alone is why I think people should check out The Handmaiden. The film's narrative goes back and forth a couple of times and the way Park Chan-wook uses this to his advantage is incredible. The film led me to believe one thing was happening but then it revealed something else happening at the same time and it's these twists and turns which made the film so fun to watch and everything was built up extremely well. The twists revealed a different side of each character, kept the film suspenseful and it didn't feel forced at any given moment. The entire story was so well thought out that I found it incredibly hard to find a flaw in it.Apart from the story, the technical craft is outstanding. The production design is terrific and the colours of the films are great. I really loved the score and overall music. The cinematography and direction were sublime and the pacing was really good. It's over 2 hours long but it never felt that way because of how interesting the story and characters were. The two lead actresses (Min-hee Kim and Tae-ri Kim) had to do a lot of demanding stuff but they both were fantastic. Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Cho also gave really great performances.Park Chan-wook's twisted, sexy and suspenseful story is must watch. The only thing I didn't like was an editing choice made during the end of the film. I don't understand why a choice like that was made but apart from that everything else about The Handmaiden is truly phenomenal. Definitely give it a watch."

" A Modern Classic.
",0.0,0.9908,2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,"Wow. Just, wow. This is undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade. Every aspect of the film: the plot, the cast, the cinematography, direction, artwork and set design (I believe Wes Anderson was a big influence in all these areas). Everything is sensational - and not in a 'pretentious arty' kind of way either. It truly is a cinematic masterpiece.How this film did not sweep up at the Academy Awards that year is simply beyond me. Forget 'Best Foreign Language Film' - this should've been nominated in virtually every category. Don't get me wrong, I adored 'Parasite' and was as pleased as anyone to see that film get the recognition it deserved at the last ceremony - but 'The Handmaiden' is even better in my opinion.The main trailer itself doesn't seem to tell you too much about the characters or the plot, and after watching the movie last night I totally understand why. This is a film best watched without much prior knowledge. The film grabs you from the first minute, and then takes you on an awe-inspiring, sensual journey of feelings and emotions as a result of its distinct unpredictability. You will be thrilled, shocked, touched and totally captivated as the story unfolds - not to mention spellbound, by the sensational visual work at play throughout. Something the director and crew clearly invested so much time and imagination into.All in all, I give this film a 10/10 rating as I simply can not find a single fault. Bravo!"
" Beautiful but...
",0.5994,0.8347,2020-08-17 00:00:00,7,"I saw this on DVD having recently seen Portrait of a Lady on Fire - so my view of The Handmaiden is obviously coloured by that (wonderful) experience.The sets and cinematography are lovely, sometimes verging on the surreal, and to anyone who has not read (or seen the TV adaptation) of Fingersmith - the novel upon which the plot is based, the twist and turns in the story are surprising. I liked the way the film is divided into three chapters, with the storyline suddenly being seen from a different point of view. I wasn't, however, convinced by the portrayal of the relationship between the two women, who seem to be falling in lust rather than love. To me, the sex scenes are voyeuristic, though highly athletic (I envy their bodies!) and made me think of entries into the ""Year of the Sex Olympics"" rather than being erotic. Is this because the director is male?"
" A film best seen knowing nothing
",0.6369,0.9163,2020-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Chan-wook Park, the visionary director behind Korean classic cinema like 'Oldboy' returns with The Handmaiden, a story with twists and turns best watched given the slightest context of what the film is about. This film is impressively atmospheric as it immerses audiences in the Gothic, grimy setting the juxtaposes that of the sublime aesthetic the architecture that blends European and Japanese cultures. Without giving away the plot, The Handmaiden creates a world that sucks audiences in, with its atmosphere and number of plot twists, resulting in an excellent work that discusses themes of taboo and cultural/ideological clashes."
" Handmaids tale
",0.0,-0.191,2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"I watched the longer Directors Cut of the movie and it is something to behold. A very interesting story, that might have intrigued someone like M. Night Shyamalan too (I always have to think if I wrote that correctly - would be nice if imdb had a feature where it recognized names and helped one out). The story and its pace are fairly easy and slow to follow. There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).Having concenterated way too much on that aspect (it is what it is as someone recently said in a way worse context), the movie is well told and may reprise certain moments to give the viewer a fuller picture of what he experienced - which overall is a nice thing, but some may find redundant. Park Chan Wook is more than Old Boy, if you are still stuck on that (great movie no doubt), and he more than proves it here"

" The Handmaiden is a sumptuous, layered masterclass in romance storytelling
",0.5574,0.9977,2020-07-27 00:00:00,8,"The Handmaiden was different than I expected, but an extremely well told story. The first act seems a bit slow and straightforwards, but at the end comes the first twist, and from there the wonderful, intricate story unfolds. I am not usually a big fan of romance films because they force the relationship with no real understanding of their perspectives or reasons they care about the other person. In The Handmaiden, the layering of their perspectives by seeing events from one perspective in the first act and another in the second does a fantastic job of showing the way each opens up to this idea, despite their initial plans. The other thing that makes the romance work so well is because of the personal backstories we understand in how up to this point, they have been controlled and used (particularly sexually) by men in their lives. This is particularly poignant for Hideko, but also present for Sookhee in relation to the Count. It's a great story of two women who had turned cold and ruthless due to the way they have been treated by men in their lives, to find each other and regain some passion and joy. I love the way Park structures the story to present a simple set up and then add depth to it as the movie progresses, until by the end we see the full picture and can appreciate the wonderful journey the two women went on. The cinematography and score are excellent, but at its core this is a brilliantly crafted story of two women finding love and liberating themselves from the domineering men in their lives."
" Could have been 'The Best Erotic Thriller Ever' with more Twist in Climax
",0.6808,0.9859,2020-07-16 00:00:00,7,"The Handmaiden (2016) :Could have been 'The Best Erotic Thriller Ever' with more Twist in Climax. The Handmaiden certainly has one of the best Twist for any thriller in the last decade but the film is hurt because the climax is revealed much before it opens the 2nd and 3rd subplots of the narrative. The primary plot is, A woman is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress, but secretly she is involved in a plot to defraud her. When the 2nd plot running along with it is opened we audience are totally shocked but then there is third plot which is even weaker than any ordinary single plot thriller to spoil the momentum. There are plenty of small small loopholes in the Twists but formally endurable because you are going to witness something amazing after that but then you meet one weak side of this narrative which doesn't do anything thrilling but just eat time and make it Overlong. Just imagine, if the third story in the film had pre-planned twist, The Handmaiden would have probably ended as the 'Best Erotic Thriller Ever made'. For now the opportunity is lost but anyways it still has 2 Great Twisty tales corners and 1 weak side in this triangular Thriller. People might not like the sexual explicit scenario but somehow it was used correctly according to the need of the script and thankfully it wasn't added deliberately just to please perverts. The Handmaiden is technically very powerful because the use of camera and background score makes this one look quite furtive. All the actors have done no compromises while being wild physically and verbally which is impressive. Director Chan-wook Park did a great job while crafting it but only if could have made it more pacy as pace is one of the most needed element in thriller genre. Overall it's a Great Erotic triangle of thrill in which two sides are strong and one is weak. Surely Watchable but not a Must see material.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
" Good. Not great.

Unfortunately, I was expecting a lot and till the very last minute was hoping for a good mind boggling twist, but it never came. The movie is good but definitely overrated. Sex scenes are very weird and not sexy in any way."
" Beautiful chreography
",0.5994,0.8481,2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,Many reveiws speak of the filming and choreography which is excellent. Two young women find themselves falling in love in a world dominated by men and male power. Often bruttal and misogynistic. Worth watching how male power over women is normalised.
" beautiful, bold, captivating
",0.7579,0.9955,2020-06-26 00:00:00,9,"I have noticed on other occasions that many of the Korean films refuse easy categorizations. This is also the case of 'The Handmaiden', the film made in 2016 by Chan-wook Park. It is a mature film, a film that starts from an English horror-Gothic style novel, moves the action in Korea occupied by Japan in the 30s of the last century, and develops into a synthesis of psychological and erotic thrillers with family saga and social cinema with a strong feminist touch. The personal imprint is very visible, the director that 'Oldboy' made famous in the world manages once again to tell fluently and with a unique visual perfection a Tarantino style story that takes place in a Japanese Hitchcock setting. I think there will be viewers who are bothered by one or the other of the details and scenes in the film, but I don't think many can escape the magnetic charm of the story put on screen by this Korean master. Yes, master. I think that with this film, Chan-wook Park earned - at least for me - the title of master of the art of film.The film has four characters moving in a world that feels like a kind of historical pulp fiction, probably a retrospective satire of the Japanization of the Korean high and ascending classes that happened during the colonial period in the early 20th century. They all imitate Japanese behaviour, take Japanese names, aspire to become or at least look Japanese, which was probably the sign and appearance of the social rise of the period. Kouzuki (Jin-woong Cho), a rich old man, owner of a villa whose architecture mixes Victorian and Japanese styles and collector of an impressive library of precious books and lithographs, raises (severely, not to say cruelly) and educates Hideko (Min-hee Kim) the daughter of his late wife's sister who committed suicide years ago. Does he intent to marry her or does he just use her as a refined object of pleasure for the erotic readings served to his male friends? Hideko has a beautiful dowry, which he tries to get his hands on, same as do the young artist who introduces himself as Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha) and the maid Sook-Hee (Tae-ri Kim), in fact a clever pickpocket who becomes the pivot of a chain of intrigues worthy of a saga of a fallen family, with many hundreds of pages devoured by readers. The plans will change several times, same as the viewer's perspective throughout the film, which is divided into three approximately equal in time parts, in which the story is told and repeated from different points of view.The narrative technique of alternative perspectives has already been used in the world cinema, including that of the Far East, by master Kurosawa for example. Here it seems to me that a new dimension is being added, because the two storytellers are the young Sook-Hee and Hideko whose connection is constantly evolving and oscillating between a master-maid relationship, solidarity facilitated by the shared destinies of traumatic childhoods marked by the deaths of the mothers, complicity , enmity, rivalry and love. It's one of the most beautiful stories of its kind I've seen on screens lately, and Chan-wook Park demonstrates his mastery of psychological characterization, as well as his ability to transform shocking details of violence and sex into functional elements of action. All four acting performances are perfect. Visually, the film is a delight, at no time is the camera neutral, the most interesting and unusual angles serve the story and each frame is studied and staged with the aesthetic refinement of the Japanese prints. Viewers who a priori reject movies that are too violent or which contain too explicit scenes will probably avoid this film anyway. For those who will see it, however, it will be difficult, I think, not to fall under the spell."
" Woah. Shockingly engaging thriller.
",0.2732,0.9648,2020-06-25 00:00:00,9,"This is probably one of my favourite movies of the last few years. It's extremely engaging and shocking both narratively and visually. The acting, pacing, and visuals of the film were all fantastic. Each character was well defined and explored.This movie isn't perfect but it's pretty close to it. There are two things that come to mind which I think might fix it in my opinion. The first is a minor problem. At some point in the second half in the film, the camera freezes on each of the characters and fades to the next scene. It's the only scene where this happens, and I don't know why. It's jarring and unnecessary as far as I'm concerned.The second is in the structure. For the first half of the movie we're lead to believe that Sook-Hee is conning Lady Hideko at the behest of Count Fujiwara. We then realize that Fujiwara and Hideko had conned Sook-Hee. This definitely caught me off guard, especially since I had grown to expect Sook-Hee to help Hideko because she had fallen in love with her. The problem arises soon after this, when we learn that Hideko was actually conning Sook-Hee with Fujiwara. This isn't a major problem, I only think that this realization should've been saved for the end of the film.Anyways, I'd absolutely recommend this movie. It's one of the best thrillers I've seen come out in quite a long time."
" is it totally my cup of tea? probably not. but it's impossible to give a lower grade.
",-0.4215,0.9977,2020-06-14 00:00:00,9,"A bunch of korean films might get lost the outside viewers in some historical context (korea occupied by japan), cultural ignorance - do we know how korean society worked in the 30's? - but they have what matter the most: heart. deep characters. a very intricate and rich plot. given this, even if we don't relate totally with everything we see on the screen is impossible not to feel amazed by a lot of the action.we can read this movie in several ways: as a con film, a movie where everything can be deceiving and we need to have our eyes open in order to understand exactly what the movie means...but also as a romantic drama that i was not expecting at the beggining. a love that's impossible in a society as such, and in way the movie tends to be more about that than what it doesn't meet the eye. it gives also an insight about how society could be built: looking being more important than what people are. a society where the social ladder seems to be walked only if you try tricking someone.because both of the main female characters are so rich and vividly alive we can relate to them easily without some of the societal context. the two main male characters are kinda the ones that seem to pull the strings, the ones in control. obviously it's hard to talk about this film with no spoilers. but the truth is: is a type of film that worries about everything: hving realistic and identifiable characters. having a narrative that has twists but never betrays itself and mostly a narrative where there's always something going on.having amazing visuals, a perfect art direction with sets that make each frame rich and full of details. the cinematography is also amazing - the color pallete is great. chan wook doesn't spent that much time in the big camera shots he has, but he gives us enough time to gather all the information necessary. every shot in this film seems the right call: the detailed ones the more general ones, the shots in between the chracters while dialogues are going on...the important thing is: it won't be as hard to understand as it may sound. it's not. the plot flows well, it has amazing visual and narrative details, but you won't be that distracted at least in the first viewing. my second one would be just grabbing all the elements i missed, mostly the details on the rooms, or the carriages, or pretty much any interior. the lights on the exterior scenes. the technique behind a narrative that relys on great characters and a poignant story to tell.so even if this isn't exactly my type of film..is so well built and made that for me was impossible to give a lower grade. i can't. it would be too unfair for such a dense and detailed type of movie. definitely check it, it deserves the praise it has."

At its core, a movie not entirely about revenge but about catharsis, with great attention to both detail and symbolism, The Handmaiden, to me, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched. Park Chan Wook hardly disappoints, but this underrated gem is truly a piece of art. The chemistry and dedication between the two main characters, Hideko and Sook-hee, is incredible.""My savior who came to ruin my life"" is something I will never forget.

It's an extended commentary on Japan's occupation of Korea in the 1930s, and it's an intense piece of psychological horror from one of the masters of the genre, Park Chan-wook. But more than anything, The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core. For Park, the Korean director of crossover genre hits like Old Boy and Thirst, the movie feels like an evolutionary leap forward in an already brilliant career."

The complicity between the two women becomes the highlight of the movie, and the key to figure it all out.
It has three parts and they work just like a puzzle. I'm glad they decided to do that, because it is also why the movie is so good.

The web of trust & backstabbing which underlies the plot is beautifully displayed through splitting the movie into 3 parts/perspectives.Some of the more nuanced plot points are rushed, like the exposition in part 1, or Sook-hee's escape from the asylum, which left me confused & distracted. Maybe the director expected the audience to already be familiar with the Fingersmith which this is based on?The worst of it was the gratuitous sex scenes which were framed in a cold, voyeuristic way that made me feel like I was supposed to identify more with one of the Uncle's ""book club"" members than with Hideko or Sook-hee themselves. It's made worse by placing their successful escape alongside a weirdly sympathetic scene of ""Count"" Fujiwara in part 3.Overall, certainly better than a lot of mainstream portrayal of lesbians, but clearly still a film by a straight male director for a straight male audience, which is pretty disappointing"

You start to despise yourself and the same kind, sympathize with yourself, and be crazy about the inescapable reality and destiny .That is broken. So you finally understand that you are born free, but you are everywhere in the shackles.
Park Chan-yu may not want to discuss the depravity of human nature, but just wants to show his life and have the right to pursue happiness. In essence, this is not a feminist movie nor a LGBT topic. It is purely cross-class love, but it happens to be the same sex. The whole film is in a tight rhythm. If there is anything that can be improved, the second part has some repetitive narration explanations that are too intimate and unnecessary.
Photography is another highlight of this film. The photographer's pursuit of composition and balance is almost harsh, even if the audience comes to appreciate it as an exhibition."

Early on we see a wealthy man living in an opulent mansion who is corrupt in that he forges books to sell and wants to marry his niece for her inheritance, and a couple of grifters who want to swindle him in a cruel way that will leave the niece in a madhouse. There is some real darkness here, and this is just the start of it. The film is 145 minutes long but the production value is so high that the time seemed to fly by. It was almost ruined by director Park Chan-wook not exercising the slightest bit of restraint during the sex scenes; it goes from sweet seduction and lesbian empowerment to exploitative soft-core porn as he holds the camera/male gaze on the young actors for far longer than was necessary on more than one occasion. To me it was far steamier in the scenes of glances and small touches, though I know I sound hopelessly old-fashioned saying that. Still though, this was a damn good film."

" Lugubrious pacing and drawn out erotic scenes compromise cleverly-plotted love triangle set in Japanese occupied Korea
",0.2732,0.9831,2020-01-08 00:00:00,5,"The Handmaiden is Korean director Park Chan-wook's ""erotic psychological thriller"" according to Wikipedia. You would think that a film set in 1930s Japanese occupied Korea would provide some insights into that particular era, but think again. The political context is lacking and the film is simply a fractured love triangle featuring erotic elements.
The narrative is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we're introduced to a con man, Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) who seeks to con a Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) into marrying him; he conscripts a pickpocket, Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) to work as handmaiden to Hideko, with instructions to convince her mistress of the suitability of taking Fujiwara as her husband.
If The Handmaiden has any value at all, it's in its clever plotting: in Part 1, we see everything from Sook-hee's point of view. We're led to believe that Hideko is an innocent, under the tutelage of her uncle Kouziki (Cho Jin-woong), a Korean collaborator, who aided the Japanese in securing a foothold following the takeover of his native country. Kouziki sells expensive forged erotic novels at auction to rich Japanese. Sook-hee ends up having sexual encounters with Hideko on the pretext that this is what she can expect (and even more) from the Count.
Part 2 is narrated from Hideko's point of view. This is where we become privy to the previously alluded to ""big twist."" In a series of flashbacks, we see that Uncle Kouziki was abusive, driving his wife to suicide and abusing his adopted niece Hideko when she was both a child and adult (Hideko is often forced to narrate the uncle's erotic novels in front of a leering group of clients at the auctions).
Fujiwara's initial plan is to have Hideko committed to a mental institution after marrying her, and splitting the proceeds of her inheritance with Sook-hee. Fujiwara however soon learns that Hideko is no innocent and concludes conning her probably would not be successful. Instead, he modifies his plan to have Sook-hee committed and marry Hideko after falling in love with her.
Part 3 features a further plot reversal. Here Hideko decides to double cross the Count after to admitting to herself that she was in love with Sook-hee all along! You can possibly guess the rest of it: Hideko drugs the Count and has him brought back to her uncle, who initially attempts to torture him but ends up dead after the Count facilitates a convenient murder/suicide.
As for the two women, they end up scot free, making love to one another as the camera fades out. Note here that The Handmaiden features a good deal of erotic scenes (particularly between the two women) which doesn't add much to the drama and ends up slowing the proceedings down considerably. Despite the good acting and cinematography, The Handmaiden also suffers from characters without many redeeming characteristics, which prevents us from getting too absorbed in their slow-footed machinations.
If The Handmaiden wasn't so lugubrious, it probably would have been more engaging, but the glacial pacing relegates it to the pantheon of mediocre films on the international circuit in the past decade."

",0.2449,0.9665,2019-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I'm late to the party on this one, so I'll keep it brief.My only previous experience of director Chan Wook-Park's work was 2003's ultra-violent Oldboy that was later remade for US audiences.This takes a reverse sweep by adapting a western tale for the east.It uses Sarah Watters' sublime Victorian lesbian bodice-ripper, Fingersmith, as its source material and translates it into Korean/Japanese culture.It's bloody brilliant.It's sumptuous in its design.The acting is universally excellent and the story is a guess a minute thriller that holds your attention for every second of its 155 subtitled minutes (yellow for Japanese dialogue, white for Korean).The story is all about jeopardy, class and the real meaning of love and it's sultry, sexy, beautiful and actually quite hilarious in parts.It's no wonder it's made it to IMDB's top 250 of all time.I rate it a straight ten. What a brilliant and unexpected way to spend a wet November Monday night."
" So worth putting the time aside
",0.2944,0.9882,2019-11-11 00:00:00,8,"It's rare that I can watch a movie this long in one go. Obligingly it divides itself into three distinct acts that serve as convenient check points so you really feel the progress being made.Does it justify its runtime? It really is an epic story, not in the sense that it spans any great amount of space or time but in how it shows with great ambition and attention to detail, explores a complex and enigmatic relationship, that is for both its participants a testing of the limits of gender, sexuality, ethnicity and economic class.A sensual and atmospheric evocation of a particular time and place where two cultures live uneasily side by side, there is plenty of the Korea/Japanophiles to jack off over except there is an irony to it presentation of ostentatious culture and refinement; showing the dark side to the beautiful and that deeper vision that lies beyond the patriarchal gaze. (I woke up this morning in a pretentious mood).The non-linear narrative structure presents us with mystery and intrigue regarding its central conflict, where less and less is exactly what it seems and we are treated to an impressive bout of story telling and misdirection in this tale of hidden identity and self discovery as well as characterisation and thoughtfulness.Very visually beautiful with a lyrical surface belying the bitter core, in which even the whether are not immune from this world of alienation and loneliness.A serious movie, but with a sense of humor when it needs it. A love story of sorts, but thankfully that kind in which the relationship is a tool to explore the characters rather than the other way around.My only real issue is that it is not exactly cogent what the plan is even when we're supposed to know.Not a movie to watch casually, but give this movie the commitment it requires and it will pay you back in spades."

" Good story... for a porno
",0.4404,-0.672,2019-11-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is essentially just a very well-written pornographic film, and there's no reason for it to be. If you remove the unquestionably excessive scenes, it becomes a thrilling tale of deception and cunning, with dialogue and acting that deeply convinced me the actor's truly felt their characters' emotions. But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography? Whatever his motives may be, I now firmly believe that he is a dirtier old man than the dirty old man in his story, and this movie that had so much potential only leaves me feeling dirty too."
" Lavish but strangely juvenile
",-0.4215,0.7747,2019-10-19 00:00:00,6,"Sarah Walters's novel 'Fingersmith', a tale of power, perversion, pornography and passion in Victorian England, gets a lavish Korean makeover in Park Choon-Wok's movie 'The Handmaiden'. It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity. But for all the artistry, I never quite escaped the feeling of a tale told by schoolchildren, snickering behind the bikesheds."

During the first half, the movie seemed like a slow period drama about 1930s Korea showing how woman were slaves nothing but in name. But during that slow pace, movie added some seeds which came to fruitions in the later half of the movie. No spoilers, but the first twist just before the second part made the movie alive and after that, it was rollercoaster ride full of highs and lows.Unfortunately, the movie shows all its cards by the end of the movie which doesn't warrant rewatchablity because you've already seen important scenes twice from all possible perspective.The high rating movie from me because of the twists and look of the movie.

",-0.4019,0.9923,2019-08-06 00:00:00,10,"They say that you have seen your favourite movie of all time before you turn 25. That still holds true for yours truly, but it still pleases me that my personal Top 50 can change even when I'm in my 30s.The Handmaiden is the tale of a young con artist named Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri), hired by a man to play the role of a handmaiden for an umarried, wealthy heiress named Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), who he wishes to seduce, marry and then get rid off. But things get complicated when Sook-hee starts to develop feelings for Hideko. Even more so when the tumultuous and horrid details of Hideko's life start to become known.The Handmaiden is told in three parts, from three different perspectives, each going through many of the same events as the previous ones, but each revealing more and more. They stick with the scene longer or start earlier, allowing us to see that not everything is at it seems. And that works beautifully. This is a layered story at its best. No matter how much you've guessed, no matter how much you already know, there's always just a bit more to figure out, a bit more to the story. And it just works.Plus the film is just beautifully told and executed. The camera angels, the costuming, the sets, the dialogue, the acting. The director Chan-wook Park was already an international sensation thanks to his Vengeance trilogy, especially its middle film Oldboy, but this just might blow that film out of the park.Fantastic film. Daring, inventive, inquisitive, secretive, revealing, sexy, sly and all around great. A must see film for all fans of cinema."

" A gorgeous and spellbinding movie
",0.6124,-0.2081,2019-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Aesthetically mesmerizing and intricately written. The story is separated into three parts, showing different occurrences through other points of view with different contexts. The director wants the audience to second, even third guess themselves. One part might show a particular scene one way, and the next may show it through a different angle/tone, adding or excluding dialogue. It creates an atmosphere where the characters true intentions are not clear. This contributes to the film's unpredictability. The set for much the movie is an incredible estate, built with an extreme contrast in English and Japan architecture. A maze lending itself to voyeurism and eavesdropping. The sex scene (shown twice with different contexts) is as intense and provoking as it gets for the big screen. Much homage is payed to artistic vision in this movie: The shots of the many scrolls and paintings/drawings themselves, the closeups of spying eyes, the visual reenactment of the erotic novels, and scenes with the estates Japanese gardens as the backdrop. Pickpocket or handmaiden? Count or con? Pampered Countess or prisoner?"

But mystery combined with feminism gives a really interesting movie to enjoy. I really have not seen much similar stories in present movies.Main Actress,Tomako has done a great work with her acting .She has allowed emotions to be flowed from her facial gestures and viewers will be at very ease when watching her actions. Because they are so expressive and vocal. Hodeko , the second lead actress does a poor job. She is keeping some part of emotions in her self without wholeheartedly spilling it out. Its a fundamental issue she should avoid. Lead Actor ,Mr.Count should have done a better role and he is depending the acting of two actresses for his brilliance. That way is not the correct way.Nudity is used with care in the film with a purpose.Nudity is not inserted to attract people because of its nude content.It should be praised.Locations are really attractive but too much details. Viewers has so much to absorb in a scene. Last Samurai is a really good movie which we cannot see this issue."

",0.0,0.8511,2019-06-23 00:00:00,4,"The Handmaiden is widely regarded as a critically acclaimed film, but lacks the substance to justify its significant praise. At a running time of nearly 3 hours, the film is in desperate need of editing to reduce its excesses - of which there are many. The plot is dragged on for far too long, and the voids are filled with unnecessary, protracted, over-the-top sex scenes to force sexuality into a story that it does little to benefit. While the central premise of the film (a revenge tale) is promising, it is squandered by the film's length and lack of originality. After the first twist of the film is revealed, the plot becomes increasingly predictable and offers little payoff for the viewer's time.The acting and cinematography were well done, but wasted on a movie that offered far less than it was promised to be. In truth, this movie could have been edited down to half its running length with nothing of value lost.My advice: 3 hours of your life are better spent on almost anything else.WE OUT HERE"
" A visual South Korean world cinema delight
",0.5994,0.9292,2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Well a feast for my eyes! Visually stunning first foray into South Korean world cinema.The Handmaiden is based on a Victorian England crime novel Fingersmith but with the locale cleverly moved to 1930s Korea under Japanese rule.The film has deceit, secrets, plans and some pretty steamy lesbian scenes thrown in for good measure.Director Chan-Wook Park has made a 145 minute foreign language film really interesting.I made the mistake of watching this film over two sittings. Split into three acts with multiple timelines it needs a single viewing.
The plot follows Sook-Hee, a handmaiden (servant) to a rich Japanese heiress who is being conned by a Korean con man.
Or is she? The film has more twists than a fairground twister ride!"
" Masterclass Cinema
",0.0,0.9943,2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year. You may not agree with me but for me this is cinema of the masterclass level.It's sexy time!"

Because it is one of the best films I've seen...ever.I was absolutely (and continue to be, as I've watched it two more times since) stunned by this movie. The story is so engrossing and TIGHTLY written. The twists and turns, I can't imagine the amount of work that went into the script itself. The characters are all beautifully layered, which is only enhanced by the great actors that portray them (and it must've been some WORK to play these characters who wear masks on top of masks throughout the film). The visuals and camera work are amazing as well. I particularly loved the colors and palette, which is so vivid and bright throughout.

" Sadly intimate and beautiful
",0.2732,0.984,2019-03-25 00:00:00,9,"The dramatic and sarcastically tense film of the beloved Korean director Park Chan-Wook. It is like a punch in the stomach with a cotton glove, as he plays with viewer and his point of view several times during the plot, we love and hate characters with a frequency of frightening changes and unlike similar scripts, here everyone has construction, everyone has senses, everyone works and everyone has their own narrative weight.With a script that tells the story of a man who seeks to win a rich woman to give him a blow and get his money, the film works in a trio, man, woman and his maid, seems simple at first glance, however its roterisk features, ramifications and development end up leaving the plot much wider, complex and beautifully functional.The trio created by Park Chan works very well, has all its plots and twists very well fitted, at certain times, we love and hate everyone, besides the good performances and motivations convincing with their development. In addition to talking about topics such as sexualization, ambition, greed, manipulation, ethnic strife, violence and psychological torture in a playful but raw.The highlight of the film in the first moment is its script, however, we have here a great soundtrack, optimistic and sad at the same time, which complements the void that each character has, plus a clear and beautiful photograph that contrasts with internal angles cold and colorless, causing caustrophobia. The photograph of the film speaks with its shooting angles, innocence and perversity intertwine with a macabre beauty, the sex scenes are extremely well filmed, intimate and irrational, that are at the same level of their scenes violent and cruel, psychologically and physically . With some planes sequences and angles open, its direction is beautiful.In addition, we have great costumes, composition of scenes, makeup and sound, ""The maid"" is a complete film.""The maid"" is not perfect, but flirts with perfection, aesthetics and technique, we have a great movie, full of feelings and symbologies. 9/10"

The twists are all so cleverly written; it's witty, funny and romantically naive at times.
This movie is a present; a gift; and needs time to be appreciated.

My only problem with this was that it was so erotic. I had no idea it was going to go all the places it did and that might just be bad on my part but, nonetheless, since I was so unprepared for it, I took off a star. It was a good, edge of your seat drama though."

",0.0,0.9001,2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Because of Oldboy, I had very high expectations... So maybe that explains why the experience fell a little flat. I think it is to do with the fact that I was expecting a suspense full of tension. First of all, I would classify it as a dramedy of sorts. Why people relate this to any Hitchcock is beyond me. I didn't find it even remotely tense -- we can easily predict what is going to happen in each of the three parts, and there is no element of fear. All along we know that everything is going to turn out fine. The character of the uncle, for instance: I kept waiting for him to show his true colours in a much worse way. The conman is stupid and goofy. And the female characters are beautiful and fun to watch, but superficial and silly as well. I did find it funny at times and even laughed out loud with one or two scenes. The characters and the plot are kind of childish, and perhaps would have benefited from being a little sharper, thus turning the experience into a more Almodóvar-like one. But overall it is quite entertaining. Scenery and costumes are kitsch enough, and the fast pace and kookiness remind us of Tarantino."

In reality, she comes from a 'family' of thieves hired by Fujiwara in a scheme to send Hideko into an asylum after marrying her.There is a shocking twist at the end of Part 1 which left me a little confused. One spends the rest of them movie trying to make sense of that turn of event. Honestly, I don't think it answers my questions fully to my satisfaction. I can't accept that it's the best escape plan for anybody. It's a scheme that can't be examined too deeply. It would be more definitive to fake her death. It leaves me feeling a little scammed especially since none of the characters can be believed at face value. They're all lying and I couldn't grab onto the truth. I'd rather they play it straight sending Hideko into the asylum and the Count double-crossing Sook-hee along with everybody else. She could return to rescue Hideko and fall in love. This one does feel a little constructed to shock. Honestly, my only reason to see this is that it's on the top 250 list. It's rare to have a pulpy twisty erotic thriller on the list. This one is beautiful and shot like an art piece. This is a real artistic endeavor from the nude erotica to the complex story construction. It is highly ambitious although I remain unconvinced by the twist."

Despite of this, he was able to convert the story, the characters and the costumes and scenarios into the dynamics of the Japanese occupation of South Korea during the war. Thus, the film tackles themes as love, betrayal, conflicts on personal interests and liberation. With only four characters, the movie offers a magnificent story with several plots and twists, thanks to a successful choice of narrative style and form.
The Handmaiden is an amazing movie that evidences the perfected style of a recognized director who surpasses himself with every movie he releases, that shows majestic combinations of quality cinematography, editing, sound and the perfect use of scenarios, a very well written and complex characters, along with an even more well developed story throughout the plot, thanks to the correct decisions made on form and style of the film.

" Disgusting bunch of irrelevant feminism propaganda
",-0.6597,0.739,2018-05-24 00:00:00,4,"Chan-wook Park used to be such a great director, being the man behind the success of the fantastic 'Revenge trilogy' and most notably Oldboy (2003) as his ultimate masterpiece. Unfortunately The Handmaiden is not a masterpiece, just a bunch of blatant in your face social commentary.The problem lies not in the cinematography, which is top notch the entire film. It is visually beautiful, with great use of color and indoor cultural Asian scenery, and some fantastic costume design. The music is also a very good emotional piece as is usual in a Park film. However, the best parts end here. You could say that the complex multi layered non linear storyline is well structured narrative, but i disagree. It basically shows the same events two times from different angles and with a couple of scenes added to it that would otherwise have been a spoiler. The story is constantly twisting because of things that we couldn't see but there is not an ounce of refinement in it. ( That person wants to sell that one out for their own gain, now another person wants to sell that one out for their own gain, now two persons pair against another to sell that one out for their own gain ). This entire immoral construct never ends as there is little to none character development.All our four main characters are rotten to the core and this never changes throughout the film, yet somehow Park decides the two women are the good ones and the two guys are the bad ones? Such an incredibly lazy political message which is something that i would never have suspected from an artist such as Park, but it happened. The 'Count' ends up being the fall guy, for being dumb enough to not realize he is being deceived, which is hardly a surprise since men do not seem to realize anything at all in this film. The uncle is just a disgusting sadistic psychopath who also sees his downfall because of his own plain stupidity. The two women are not very likeable either, albeit in a more subtle way since their unlikeable nature is due to the fact that they only seem to care about money but all the while not showing their sadistic sides. The way the final events unfold is not a very subtle way of creating a kind of feministic statement that they cannot be pushed around by men.The erotic part of this film is absolutely utterly useless. There are numerous graphic sex scenes between the two women which do not enhance anything in this pretentious story but only seem to serve as a bunch of pornographic material good enough to get into the minds of those feeble minded and blind enough to like this film. Disgusting sexually oriented pictures and disgusting dialogue are constantly thrown at the viewer in order to gain the thumbs up only because of this pathetic form of pornographic flattery. It is a motion picture, which is supposed to be an artform, yet this is a mere disguise for the mindless pornographic nature of this film. I am fortunate enough to have a brain smart enough to not take the bait.It sure is pretty to look at, and might entertain those who want to see female nudity and simulated sex scenes between females, but for those smarter among us, this really is a poor excuse for a motion picture that is supposed to open our minds or make us better understand the human condition."

The cinematography on the other hand is really good and the storyline, despite being confusing is actually kind of well executed, which means the way in which the movie is divided into acts supported the storytelling. I normally don't have a problem with sex scenes in a movie but in this, i felt as if they did not have any real purpose other than to ""please"" the audience (they defenitly weren't left in for storytelling purpose).

Another barrier is the heiress' evil uncle (Cho Jin-woong) who has dominated her for many years. The film is based on the novel ""Fingersmith"" by Sarah Waters and updates the story from Victorian England to Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20thcentury.There are various plot twists to keep this movie intriguing throughout. The first two (of three) parts are the same narrative while the second is more of a revision of the first with a different perspective. These are the best parts of the film.The third part wraps things up well enough but with some difficult violent scenes. Also, at the risk of giving away a spoiler, the story has too many resemblances to the superb American indie film / lesbian love story ""Bound"" (1996).In addition to ""Bound"", ""The Handmaiden"" takes cues from another more recent lesbian love story ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" from France. Both films had sex scenes between two women that began as erotic but ended by being (or at least bordering on) pornographic.

I can just imagine what theater movie goers must have gone through when the love scenes between Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim) and Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) took center stage. When you're not ready or prepared for it, the sex scenes can inadvertently turn a promising night out into a virtual catastrophe. The story could have been told without the explicit sex and perhaps might have been more enthralling if the affair between the Japanese heir and her Korean handmaiden been more nuanced and suggestive.

" A masterwork of cinema that is both sexually manipulative and ruthlessly violent
",-0.5994,0.9994,2018-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Park Chan-wook is a master of blending multiple themes in his films. His newest film, The Handmaiden, further proves his mastery of balancing and wrapping every element together in an enjoyable way. The Handmaiden is many things at once; sexual, thrilling, violent, and dramatic. Brilliant directing along with excellent performances make this one of the best films in recent memory. The film is set in Japanese occupied Korea during the 1930s. Sook-He is a poor Korean nursing girl that must use her skills as a pickpocket to get by. Her con artist skills get her involved in a plot by Count Fujiwara (a fake persona used by a fellow poor Korean con artist) to steal the fortune from a rich Japanese book collector by marrying his naive niece. Sook-He is sent to the book collector's vast estate as a handmaiden for the niece, Lady Hideko, who is also the inheritor of the fortune. At first, Sook-He and the Hideko don't get along, but after some time they begin to get closer and more intimate. A romance and alliance forms, one that changes Sook-He's original plan. The Count soon arrives and immediately tries to win over Hideko. From this point, the film becomes a twisted game of cat and mouse between the four main characters. You never know who's on what side and who's conning who.Chan-wook presents the film in three equal chapters. Each part focuses on a central character from their point of view. The first follows Sook-He and Lady Hideko and how they initially act around each other. The second goes back in time to reveal Hideko's childhood and how it was devilishly mangled by her uncle. The third follows the Count and Hideko as they play a game of cat and mouse with each other.Each chapter intersects with another, creating a timeline where the sequence of events is presented out of order. Actions at the beginning of the film are revisited later at different angles and from different points of view, which reveal new information that is key to the structuring of the plot. This technique beautifully creates characters and events that complex and memorable. Layers upon layers of storytelling are given to us through different mediums. It keeps thing fresh as we are constantly piecing the timeline in our heads. One could knock Chan-wook for his overuse of gratuitous sex in a few scenes. The romance between Sook-He and Hideko results in intercourse, which ultimately lasts close to ten minutes and ends up feeling like softcore porn. However, the actual sequence is integral to the main story and is done with such care that it barely hinders the overall quality.Chan-wook is known for his outlandish films that are filled with deep storytelling and rich visuals. Here he has outdone himself as the plot gets more interesting as time passes and the grandiose visuals are candy to the eyes. He uses the Korean and Japanese languages as an element of his story as each brings its own symbolism and meaning. Characters flip between languages constantly and each shift is for a specific purpose. As we are the watching the film, we get a sense that the main theme revolves around female empowerment. At the start of the film, both Sook-He and Hideko are servants under powerful men. Their similar circumstances lead them to form their own destiny together, one that is without a master.The cinematography is gorgeous as we are treated to some of the most elaborate and pleasing shots in recent memory. Chung Chung-hoon uses his full arsenal to create a brilliant sense of atmosphere inside the convoluted mansion. Zoom, pan, and crane shots are used with a clear purpose. They frame the scenes perfectly, giving each actor the right amount of space for their performance. The acting, like the rest of the film, is wonderfully done. The standout performance comes from Kim Min-Hie as Lady Hideko. Her ability to immediately switch from a naive schoolgirl to a vengeful enchantress creates an aura of mystery around her. Kim Tae-Ri as the young Sook-He is amazing as well. She brings a sense of youth and acts as our guide for most of the film. We see most things through her eyes and her reactions and facial expressions are tied to ours as well. Finally, Ha Jung-woo as the Count and Cho Jin-woong as the uncle are a creepy pair of power-hungry men. Their methods may differ, but their results are the same. Jung-woo is confident and cool while Jin-woong is cold and menacing. Both share some great scenes with the lead women and have great chemistry.The Handmaiden is a film that carries multiple themes and things it's trying to do. It exceeds in every area possible, keeping right on track as Chan-wook delivers a story that is both challenging and pleasing. The Handmaiden is n feat in cinema that should be seen by all who want to witness a master at his best."
" Very Asian, very erotic, very interesting, British?!
",0.5497,0.9837,2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"The movie starts with a young Korean girl leaving her family to go to be a servant in a Japanese household. The visuals, the language, the mood, they are all so Asian. The eroticism is so pronounced even from the start, so different from the sanitized Anglo-Saxon media, too. So I was quite amazed to hear that this is an adaptation of a British Novel called Fingersmith. The adaptation is great, though. I can't say much about the story without spoiling it, but it is split into three parts, each from a different viewpoint, showing you that things are far from straightforward. It's basically a thriller noir, only set in 1930's Japanese occupied Korea. I liked the acting, the sets, the story, but what put them all into perspective was the way it was all presented. The non linear way of storytelling really made this a fresh and interesting film. Bottom line: a very beautiful Asian adaptation of a British novel that should be easily accessible to both Eastern and Western audiences."

",0.8126,0.9975,2018-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I try not to use that word, it's rather overused for films that just aren't masterpieces. But when a film is so gorgeous that it imitates art, so multi-dimensional that it transcends the majority of narratives and so daring that it tests the limitations of film itself...I can't help but call it a masterpiece. A rich Japanese lady recruits a handmaiden who soon turns out to be a swindler, tasked with falsifying a wedding in order to steal her money. Twists and turns soon reveal many secrets that question the legitimacy of the new handmaiden's undercover task. Immediately I was hypnotised. Park Chan-Wook has such an eye for detail, every frame is lovingly crafted and resembles a jewel on a glistening necklace. Cinematography rarely looks this gorgeous, honestly. The visceral imagery conveys multiple themes of lust, greed, jealousy...in fact, nearly all the seven deadly sins are thematically interwoven in this complex narrative. Chan-Wook played me like a puppet. Manipulating my mind with every unexpected twist. It's a story of how powerful love is. An emotion so overwhelming that people are moulded by its presence. The lead characters all experience this, whether it be falsifying love or truly experiencing it for the first time. How motivations for money and power can be blurred by love. It's just a work of art. It truly is. Deceive me once? I applaud you. Deceive me twice? I'm jumping up and down the room like a lunatic. Tiny intricacies that are soon explained within the narrative's three parts, these revelations blew my mind. With an everlasting haunting undertone, it just made the story all the more resonating. Even the musical score was stunning, replicating orchestral symphonies with traditional Asian instruments. I will say it's an 18 for a reason, the sexual nature is extremely explicit yet it doesn't detract from the seamless story. Asian cinema has yet again proven that it's better than Hollywood. The Handmaiden, easily, acquires the perfect rating."

Basically set in the 1930s, in Korea during the Japanese occupation, beautiful and fragile Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim), lives with her sadistic and despotic uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo). Uncle Kouzuki is an intellectual and an avid collector of rare erotic literature, he has raised Lady Hideko since the tender age of five, he plans to marry her for her riches. As a result, Lady Hideko has been confined in a large dreary and sun-deprived countryside estate, she is like a caged bird. She also seems to be an easy target for forger and outright con artist Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), who hires dexterous young pickpocket Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) to act as the new handmaiden, as part of the secret plot to defraud her. The Count needs Sook-hee to persuade the unaware noblewoman to marry him, and when the elaborate scam is successful, he will ruthlessly and without any remorse whatsoever, he will send her to an asylum. The con was proceeding according to plan, but Lady Hideko's unparalleled beauty with her long raven hair, luscious scarlet lips and velvety skin is no match for them. The scheme is doomed to fail when Lady Hideko and Sook-hee discover unexpected emotions and a romance develops, and in the end Count Fujiwara realises what's going on, he uses cigarettes laced with mercury to poison Kouzuki, the two women celebrate their freedom, making love. Also starring Hae-sook Kim as Miss Sasaki and So-ri Moon as Aunt of Lady Hideko. The leading actresses give good performances as the heiress and the young swindler who become believable lesbian lovers, and the actor playing the monstrous uncle is good, obviously having to read subtitles it was not easy to concentrate, but I got the general gist. The story was originally based on a book set in Victorian Britain, the new setting is put to good use, the costumes and scenery are marvellous to look at, the psychological thriller style and macabre stuff is interesting, and the love story and sexual scenes are beautifully done, all in all it is an intriguing and worthwhile erotic drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. Good!"

Initially, I thought this was supposed to be a horror movie and while it has horrific moments, it's certainly not horror. It's more suspense, mystery, lesbian drama.In fact, I haven't seen this much graphic lesbian sex in my life. I'm no prude, but girl-on-girl action isn't my forte, so it's not on my top ten porn searches. But, if you're into that, you might be pleased when it shows up several times in the film.The movie revolves around a rich heiress who's woo'd by a scheming Count and his Maid-to-Be to get her fortune. She's somehow set to marry her uncle, but the Count's got other plans for her cash. Only, his decoy, the film's title, has other plans.While I had to start/stop this several times, it's highly recommended as it's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, scored excellently and the twists just keep on coming that makes the whole experience worth it. Yes, it's overlong and could've been severely cut, but it pays off and in the most satisfying way.

",0.0,0.6648,2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"I admit to being a little disappointed when I found out that master film-maker Park Chan-wook's latest film would be THE HANDMAIDEN, a remake of a lesbian romantic drama filmed by the BBC as FINGERSMITH. This one relocates a tale of Victorian London to South Korea, where a murky plot involves mucho double-crossing as a con man decides to employ a maid to help him seduce a Japanese heiress due to inherit a fortune.Like the rest of Park Chan-wook's output, this is an expertly-made piece of drama, with sumptuous costumes and filmography, and fine performances from the cast. A pity, then, that it turns out to be merely a romantic drama with a few dark twists. The emphasis is on explicit sex throughout. Imagine if the director had instead put his talents to making another film like OLDBOY - now that would have been something special. This lengthy, languidly-paced film has some good storytelling methods and nice twists throughout, but otherwise it feels disappointingly shallow."

The way this movie portrays human degeneracy, greed, compassion and love is just mindbogglingly genius. This movie single handedly made me realise how bad Hollywood productions have gotten. This reminded me on how good movies can be. No super heroes, no nonsense, jut a pure raw story to tell. Magnificent."
" top notch film making
",0.2023,0.9863,2017-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Another very impressive film from Chan-wook Park who manages to draw his audience in from the very start. The opening scenes seem very quick and it appears it may be too difficult to keep up for the fairly long running time but it turns out to be a breeze. The pace slows and we are rewarded for our early concentration as so much makes so much sense so soon. Not always so with Asian movies, for western audiences, it seems to me. Park has such a wonderful sense of framing and is not afraid to move his cameras in unconventional ways. The sumptuous interiors and exteriors may have the appearance of the equivalent of an English historic romance but here the cameras offer us views and movement more akin to a full on action movie. Split into three parts, I found myself slightly bewildered at the start of the second section but soon caught up with the audaciousness of Mr Park and his co-writer. Beautiful, explicit, daring and rewarding, this is top notch film making."
" In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.
",0.2263,0.9993,2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!8/10"
" there are places that you can't truly understand
",-0.3412,-0.7701,2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"You may have heard Park Chan-wook's ""Ah-gah-si"" (""The Handmaiden"" in English) called an erotic psychological thriller. That's true, but the movie is more. It addresses relationships and abuse. Very well, I might add. I'm not sure how much of it I can describe without giving a lot away. I can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this. There's plenty of sex, but none of it gratuitous.The only other Park movie that I've seen is the bland ""Stoker"", so I'm impressed. I would definitely like to see the rest of his movies. Moreover, I would like to see more movies set in Korea under Japanese colonial rule (a part of history too often overlooked). Not a masterpiece, but one that I recommend."

Don't get me wrong i really like 'Lady Vengeance', 'Thirst' and 'Stoker' but in comparison they felt flat. Now Chan-Wook slightly changed his style and made a more accessible movie for the general audience, but at the same time a great movie.'The Handmaiden' is clever, well constructed, full of great characters and in a strange but understandable way erotic. Especially, the two female characters showed a great range of emotions and acting skill in this movie. I most admit after the first big turn in the story of the movie, i expected the way the story would play out in the end. But this didn't stop the stylish and nice way the story was told.Even if you are not familiar wit Oldboy or Asian cinema, go watch this movie you will at least like it."
" An absolutely psychotic but exhilarating film
",0.6054,0.9992,2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"This is quite an exceptional film. With two and a half hours of intense, rapid-fire betrayal, unpredictability and purely psychotic thrills, The Handmaiden is an intoxicating watch from start to finish. Directed stupendously by Park Chan-wook, and featuring three amazing central performances, it's a film that will grab you with its unbelievable levels of insanity and darkness, but will thrill you again and again with a sumptuous and confident execution of an enthralling story.Let's first establish what on earth this film really is, and why that makes it so brilliant. On the one hand, this works on its own as a period thriller, with the setting of Korea under Japanese colonial rule allowing for some insight into the time period of the 1920s-30s, as well as some beautiful costume and production design, all of which plays a big role in making the film as elegant as it is.On the other hand, the story is an incredibly intense affair featuring twists and turns the likes of which you've never seen. The film is directed by Park Chan-wook, who also made the legendarily messed-up thriller Oldboy, a fact that's even more disturbing when you realise that The Handmaiden is in more ways than one even more psychotic and terrifying than that movie.The story is one of deception, betrayal and love from start to finish, and in that, it's very reminiscent of two classic thrillers. The style of its story, featuring three acts based around three enormous but totally unpredictable twists, is much like how David Fincher's Gone Girl plays out, whilst the content of the story, involving two characters secretly working together to get one over on someone they have befriended is hugely reminiscent of Diabolique, a film so effective in its thrills that it actually influenced the success of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.Anyway, it's a plot that's difficult to talk about without giving away any spoilers, but it is one that is utterly thrilling at every moment. Not just an unpredictable mystery, but a story so full of depth and emotional intrigue, allowing its characters to flourish in the most unorthodox of ways as the plot snowballs towards breaking point.However, the plot alone isn't what makes this film so amazing. Above all, Park Chan-wook's direction plays a huge role in that. As we know, Park is a director with the ability to not just weird you out, but chill you to the bone with some pretty demented stories.Here, he doesn't hold back even for a second when it comes to portraying the sheer brutality of the lead trio. The story that unfolds effectively takes the form of a love triangle, but Park makes sure to emphasise the darker side of that sort of conflict by filling the film with some incredibly frank and unbelievably graphic sex.Now, many films go too far on this front and become completely gratuitous, but that's not the case with The Handmaiden. Although there are two scenes that are almost unwatchable given their graphic nature, the sex scenes play an incredibly powerful and central role to the entire story, and without being portrayed in such a frank and carnal manner, the intensity of the story and the betrayals that come about as a result would never have been so strong.Another reason that the film is so intense is simply because it just doesn't stop. It may run for almost two and a half hours, but believe me, that time feels no more than ten minutes thanks to the unbelievable pace of the movie. Split up into three perfect parts whose structure messes with your perceptions of the story as much as anything else in this movie, the story moves along at an almost relentless pace, continuing to snowball as things get far darker, and far, far more disturbing, but it makes for an incredible viewing experience that leaves you completely intoxicated from the very first scene to the very last.Finally, we can't forget the performances, which are just as brilliant as everything else in the movie. The leading trio are exceptional to watch, and they work amazingly on screen with one another, with just enough chemistry to make their cordial relationships convincing, and yet enough alarm in their individual turns to keep everything on a knife edge.Kim Min-hee is amazing as the Japanese heiress, and is able to throw you way off scent when it comes to really figuring out what her character is all about. Then Kim Tae-ri is just as brilliant as the handmaiden herself, and shows an incredible level of intensity as what at first seems like the film's most orthodox character. And finally, Ha Jung-woo excels as the Korean man disguising himself as a Japanese count to win the heiress' affections (and fortune), with a strong, and often even frightening performance bringing total unpredictability to proceedings.On the whole, I was absolutely blown away by The Handmaiden. It's an intense and at times jaw-dropping piece of work that will have your eyes glued to the screen at almost every second. Directed beautifully by Park Chan-wook, it's an elegant period drama crossed with one of the most intense and demented thrillers you'll ever see, and its incredibly graphic sex will have you cowering away while being simultaneously stunned by the dramatic power on display. Its two and a half hours pass by in an instant, but its intensity and purely psychotic nature will stay with you long afterwards."

His idea: The lady shall fall in love with him, and after the marriage he will put her in an asylum. The pickpocket Sook-hee, disguised as a handmaiden, is meant to influence Hideko. Fujiwara, Hideko and Sook-hee entangle themselves in a web of liaisons and intrigues ...""The Handmaiden"" by Park Chan-wook is the riveting tale of a love triangle, where nothing is as it seems. It's disturbing, humorous, erotic, suspenseful and cryptic - a treat for everyone enjoying weird and original cinema. Park Chan-wook is well known for his movies dealing with themes such as violence, perversion and insanity. ""The Handmaiden"" might be his most excellent effort to date, even surpassing the powerful revenge thriller ""Oldboy"" (2003), which is a bit too erratic and over the top. This movie however has a clear vision and a much more subtle approach, masterfully playing with the expectations of its audience and twisting the story several times.This movie is about men forcing their sexual fantasies on women: Hideko is forced to read grubby texts to a male audience and to perform strange BDSM aerobatics. The only way she can escape this perverted world is through lesbian love, which culminates in one of the most awe-inspiring sex scenes I've ever seen. Park's depiction of sexuality is subversive, as there seems to be no escape from male fantasies no matter what. (And not just because Park is a male director.) There's some really interesting subtext going on here, but that doesn't mean that ""The Handmaiden"" is just pretentious gibberish. No, it tells an entertaining and engaging story as well, all while looking gorgeous. The humour is pretty great, too: There are many laugh out loud scenes. (Yeah, there might be some penis jokes in this.)With ""The Handmaiden"", Park Chan-wook proves that he's still one of the most exciting directors in contemporary cinema. His vision is artistic and daring, light-footed and sexy, captivating and beautiful. It's a brutal thriller, a sentimental drama and an erotic romance all at once. A truly original movie. Don't miss it."

However, the second half is less compelling and plausible, with a few plot developments that don't make sense and some twists that seem there for twists sake. Momentum is lost as we have a new round of backstory, and this seems overwrought and overly long, and much of it seems unnecessary.

" Victorian England is traded for colonial Korea –a country writhing under Japanese oppression –The altering of the plot is done in such remarkable aspects, perfectly!
",0.8439,0.9883,2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Consider the octopus. Moist and squirming, this extra-terrestrial creature stalks the ocean's calm depths before merging into the scenery. It spots an unsuspecting fish passing by. Before the prey can understand why this familiar patch of seabed now seems so unsettling, it feels a clammy tentacle coil around its torso.The octopus is an ingenious hunter and has long been a sexual symbol, a tradition which director Park Chan-Wook has followed to highlight suppressed and perverted desire. The mollusc performs this role in his most notorious work Oldboy, when Choi Min-Sik devours it alive after his release from captivity. It appears again in The Handmaiden, encapsulating the film's strange mixture of predication and passion.Based on Sarah Walter's book Fingersmith, Victorian England is traded for colonial Korea – a country writhing under Japanese oppression. The new masters have absorbed the superior and modern culture of the West, using it to carve out its own imperial hegemony in the East.Mimicry of the masters is essential to advance up their ladders of power. Some, such as Uncle Kouzuki (Jo Jin-Woong), have discarded their base Korean identities in the struggle to attain a Japanese one, even going so far as to adopt a new name.This Uncle Kouzuki, in aiding the Japanese in their subjugation of the peninsula, has acquired a literal gold mine. Using this wealth, he buys his way into the circles of Japanese nobility and builds a vast gated compound in the local woods.In this estate, he lives with his niece, the Lady Hideko (Kim Min- Hee) and their servants. His own wife, a Japanese noble, is dead and Kouzuki hopes to marry his niece to secure access to her vast inheritance and lineage.However, he is not the only man with his eye on Hideko's assets. A lowly Korean forger posing as Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) aims to seduce her, enlisting the help of Nam Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-Ri) posing as her handmaiden. Their plan is to defraud Lady Hideko by marrying her to Fujiwara, then sending her to an asylum.The story is co-written between Park and Chung Seo-Kyung who borrow elements from its novelised base. They break the narrative into three parts which are carefully stripped away, each section revealing more truth than the last.Flowing through the narrative's entirety are two main plots – one a tale of romance, the other of revenge. These address the film's main themes of the struggle to reclaim love and beauty in the face of separation and predication.The film contains excellent dialogue delivered superbly by strong performances from the main cast. Each actor has been carefully selected for their role, from the horrifically impassive face of Kim Hae-Sook as butler-madame Sasaki to Kim Min-Hee's doll like features, fragile and unnerving. Their physical attributes match exactly with the personalities of their characters.The main issue some may have with this film is that it perhaps places the female leads on something of a pedestal. Their relationship is one of abiding faith and harmony. The perversion is all on the part of the males. Instead, their idolised moments of lovemaking are depicted with an attention some might find excessive.Whatever your opinions in this regard, The Handmaiden undoubtedly reinforces Park's strong reputation as a director. His direction allows for a stunning range of emotions to be weaved into this story, with an exquisite set design that would make the BBC blush. It makes for a deceptive charm many will find difficult to escape."
" a stunning piece of art
",0.3818,0.9908,2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"I don't even know where to start with this movie. For starters, it ranks up high in my favorite movies of 2016, and it's for a reason. The first thing I would like to point out is the stunning cinematography, which stays consistently good throughout the movie. The performances were amazing, especially from the two female leads, Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri. They have amazing chemistry together and leave the audience rooting for them the entire run time. The story was compelling and beautifully composed so that the viewer never really knows what's going on until the very end - not for a second did I get bored. I absolutely loved seeing the events of the film depicted from different character's perspectives. This is the type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. Park Chan-Wook nails it with the direction, as was expected of him at this point. He doesn't shy away from explicit content and the entire movie has this erotic aura surrounding it. At the same time it manages to be one of the most empowering movies for women I've seen in a long time and the movie that the LGBT community has been waiting for, which I believe is extremely important for Hollywood at this time. Let's just hope that other movies follow ""The Handmaiden's"" lead. A truly refreshing representation of homosexuality in film. In conclusion, this is a masterfully crafted movie that I would recommend to everybody, definitely one of the highlights of 2016. I can't wait to see what Park Chan-Wook has in store for us next and am excited to keep following his work."
" An exciting mystery

In his new film, Park, brings surely one of his best works, the plot is set in Korea in the thirties, in a time of Japanese occupation, and focuses on four main characters, Hideko, a Japanese heiress who lives isolated in the camp with Kouzuki, his domineering uncle, Sook-Hee, a newly hired maid, and a con artist who presents himself as Count Fujiwara to teach painting to Hideko. Being divided into 3 parts of lies and betrayals, the film has a huge camera work, abusing well-designed plans and space, both indoors and out, traveling through a mixture of English and Japanese architecture, the film is a breeze in the eyes of so beautiful, from the very accurate track, immersion in the beauty of Japanese erotic literature, the film explores well-developed characters, and of course, returns plot twist on plot twist, as the director knows well how to do, no doubt one of the best films of the year."
" Complex But Not Entirely Confident
",-0.5814,0.8821,2017-06-09 00:00:00,7,"In one of my intermittent conversations with IMDb legend Bob The Moo he recommended a 2016 South Korean film THE HANDMAIDEN. Having total faith in Bob I did make a mental note of getting round to seeing it when I had some spare time. As with any recommendation I also made a mental note of not looking up the recommendation for obvious reasons. After all I did look up a couple of early online reviews of THE MUMMY earlier today and let's just say they let the cat out of the bag. It's hardly a surprise when a film is ruined because surprise is given away. The only thing I knew in advance before seeing THE HANDMAIDEN was that the director was Park Chan-wook who made the overrated OLDBOY which reminded of something else - Bob also once recommended me THE FOUNTAIN , a film I thought was pretentious rubbish Park is something of an auteur. Revenge is a theme that intrigues him as a film maker but not in the way Hollywood would develop a revenge thriller where Bruce , Arnie , Sly or Chuck would wreak revenge on creeps via an arsenal of firearms and explosives and I'm not entirely sure if that's a compliment. By the same token it's not necessarily a complaint either but I did feel the narrative execution could have been developed better. There might be a problem in that the original source novel was set in Victorian Britain rather than 1930s Korea but I don't think it's that. What I found annoying was the constant need for characters explaining what is happening which is usually obvious and why it's happening when it's not obvious at the time but becomes obvious later on. It's certainly a complex film where objects that seem meaningless make reappearances as plot turns. Also as with OLDBOY there's a somewhat sleazy story which the audience will find divisive One thing that will never , ever shake my faith in Bob The Moo is that he knows a great looking film when he sees one. I might have hated the fractured storyline of THE FOUNTAIN but at least Aronofsky understands what cinematography is, even if he takes it to excess. With THE HANDMAIDEN director Park and cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon have made a stunning looking film which while I was sitting in front of a laptop in a smoky Edinburgh flat made me think I was either walking around rural Japan or stuck in a Japanese mansion with a bunch of deviants, Another good aspect is the editing which gives the film a pace that can't be faulted especially compared to the average Hollywood movie. There is one technical aspect I found irritating and that was the intrusive music but again this is very subjective It's certainly the visuals that impressed me with this movie , the story less so. Or should I say how the story is executed. As I said the story itself is rather complex but the constant need to spell things out shows a painful lack of confidence"
" An intriguing and visually and intellectually literate film
",0.34,0.3625,2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"South Korean films are not exactly flavour of the month in Britain, even among ""world cinema"" buffs; the most one can say is that they are at least more popular than North Korean films. ""The Handmaiden"", however, has recently had a long run in central London. Perhaps its popularity can be put down to the fact that it is based upon a novel by a Welsh author, ""Fingersmith"" by Sarah Waters, albeit with the setting changed to Korea under the Japanese occupation. Or perhaps to the fact that it features two beautiful young actresses in bed together.The plot is a complex one, too complex to set out here. It revolves around the plans of a conman posing as a Count to marry and elope with Lady Hideko, a Japanese heiress living in Korea with her authoritarian uncle. To further his scheme he hires a Korean girl named Sook-hee to obtain a position as a maid in the uncle's household. The film is divided into three parts, and Parts 1 and 2 essentially tell the story from two different viewpoints, giving us different perspectives on these events. At the end of Part 1, which is largely told from Sook-hee's viewpoint, it appears that Hideko and the supposed ""Count Fujiwara"" have conspired together and played a cruel trick on Sook-hee to enable them to elope together. In Part 2, which is largely told from Hideko's point of view, we realise that appearances can be deceptive and that it may in fact be Sook-hee and Hideko (who have become lesbian lovers) who are in league together.The film is not only based upon a British novel; director Park Chan-wook may also have been influenced by the visual style of the British ""heritage cinema"". It is notable that Hideko's uncle lives in an Edwardian-looking European-style mansion built for him by an English architect. The photography certainly has that rich, sumptuous look we have come to associate with British historical dramas, and, like some Western directors such as James Ivory and Martin Scorsese, Park is able to use this style of film-making to shed light on some weighty themes.The most important theme explored in this film is that of the mistreatment of women by men. (There is an implication, although perhaps no more than that, that Hodeko and Sook-hee have become lesbians because of the way men have treated them and that under other circumstances they might have been heterosexual). Hideko's uncle Kouzuki is a sex-obsessed bully, whose greatest passion is for his collection of antique erotica. Kouzuki is a widower, his wife having died in what was supposedly a suicide, and it is strongly implied either that she was driven to kill herself by her husband's mistreatment of her or that he in fact murdered her when she tried to leave him. During her lifetime Kouzuki distressed her by forcing her to read from his pornographic books to his guests, and after her death he subjected Hideko to the same treatment. Fujiwara may claim to love Hideko and poses as her liberator from her uncle's tyranny, but in fact he is just interested in her money. As for the working-class Korean Sook-hee, Fujiwara regards her as being both socially and racially inferior so has no compunction about the way he treats her.The film occasionally slips into Grand Guignol; the final scene involving Kouzuki and Fujiwara is particularly lurid and does not make a great deal of sense. Overall, however, this is an intriguing, visually and intellectually literate, film from a culture that does not feature very highly on the average British film buff's radar. 8/10"

Min-hee Kim stars as Lady Hikeko, a young Japanese woman of wealth and beauty living in an isolated estate with her sadistic uncle in Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s. A gaggle of Korean thieves and con artists dream up a scheme to separate Hikeko from her fortune. The idea is for one of them to pose as a Count Fujiwara, seduce Hikeko and then marry her. Aiding this scheme is a pretty little pickpocket named Sook-Hee (played with great skill and charm by Tae-ri Kim).That's all I can tell you about the plot. Rest assured it is fascinating with some very surprising twists and turns. This is also one of the sexiest movies I've ever seen. It is billed as a crime thriller but actually it is the story of a beautiful love affair. Again I will not elaborate since any more information might spoil the film for many viewers.Bottom line: I plan on seeing this again and I seldom watch films more than once, only the great ones.--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote"""
" An Excellent, Liberating Film
",0.5719,0.804,2017-05-31 00:00:00,10,"""The Handmaiden"" is a fiercely original bit of erotica that changes the setting of the novel on which it is based from England to 1930s Korea. In an example of narrative sleight of hand that would make Quentin Tarantino proud, director Chan-wook Park tells his story in three parts, each one upending the perspective of the one before and forcing his audience to re-process everything it has just seen.The first part tells the story of a young pickpocket, Sook-Hee, who is roped into a scheme concocted by a sleazy thief posing as a rich count to rob a rich heiress, lady Hideko, of her fortune. The second part tells things from the heiress's point of view, and we find out that she and the ""count"" are actually in cahoots and it's Sook-Hee who's the dupe. Then the third part details the efforts of the two women, who have fallen in love, to double cross everyone and escape to make a life together. ""The Handmaiden"" is largely about what happens when women tire of playing the role assigned to them by men and decide to write their own narrative. Storytelling is a running theme in the film, but the stories being told are all about women being sexually used by men at best but almost always suffering in some way, either physically or emotionally, at their hands. When Sook-Hee and Lady Hideko decide they don't like the parts written for them and take matters into their own hands, it's like watching a weary character in a book jump out of the pages and run away from the reader.

",0.4019,0.9843,2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"We didn't much care for Park's Eng.-lang. debut, ""Stoker,"" a formula Gothic creeper with some showy cinematography, borderline overacting and a pretty lame script. He's on much firmer ground here with a Korean cast and setting—the latter shifted from the source novel's Victorian England to Japanese-ruled Korea, c. 1930. The crusher plot line was ""inspired by 'Fingersmith,'"" one of Sarah Waters's tales of the lesbian demimonde, and the film kicks off with some vintage romance-novel shtick —a scoundrel's plotting to elope with an heiress, Lady Hideko, and relieve her of her fortune. He installs an accomplice, a skilled female pickpocket (that's what a ""fingersmith"" is, apparently), as Hideko's lady's maid to help him win her over, and the intense relationship that develops between the lady and the lady's maid is what saves ""The Handmaiden"" from being just another forgettable genre film like ""Stoker."" There's some pervy Sadean stuff involving a hanging tree and forged pornographic MSS and such, but the two heroines' tale is so compelling and the plot ticks over so smoothly—despite an amazing WTF?! moment at the end of part one—that you'll barely notice. Great performances, fascinating background (esp. the Koreans' cultural cringe toward their depraved Japanese rulers); those who have problems with what a know-it-all Netflix reviewer called ""tribadic"" sex scenes—not even sure that's the right word—should probably look elsewhere, however"

" a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp sustained with an absolutely captivating momentum
",0.0,0.9962,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Park Chan-wook's succulent period drama is a three-act intrigue set in a Japanese-occupied Korea, a close-knit cast includes a Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), her newly hired handmaiden Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri, in her blazing film debut), the professed Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo), a Korean con artist who is wooing Hideko but schemes to wrest for the marriage's collateral financial gain, and Hideko's current guardian, her uncle Kouzuki (Jo Jin-woong), a Korean book collector who is spoiling for a Japanese identity, and has no qualm of marrying his niece as long as he could keep a tight rein on the latter's magnanimous inheritance. The narrative is succinctly coordinated among the central quartet and starts from Act I, we peer into the game plan from the angle of Sook-hee, she is not a dewy-eyed lamb as the first impression suggests, but an orphan pickpocket equipped with street smart and a yen for wealth (her con artist mother died during parturition), colluded with Fujiwara, she is arranged near Lady Hideko to sweet-talk her into the marriage, which Fujiwara plans to throw her into an asylum once it is consummated, so he can hog Hideko's assets, among which Sook-hee also demands a handsome paycheck. Things get complicated when Sook-hee is swooned by a doll-like Lady Hideko, whose delicacy and naivety, the aftermath of a reclusive lifestyle imposed by Kouzuki, is something she never expects to encounter and once her sexual awakening stands in the way of Fujiwara's plan, there is no telling who will come off as the winner. Act I ends with a bang in your face, a twist segues into Act II, now we get the perspective from Lady Hideko. Sheepish is not an apposite word to describe Hideko, she can be calculating and menacing (no one can indeed see the whole picture, that's the lure of its narrative game: offer us a chance to leafing through those often imperceptible), flashback of her childhood, with her now defunct aunt (Moon So-ri in a transfixing cameo as the fruitcake) emblazons the perversity of Kouzuki and his reading club, where her aunt (later herself) are trained to narrate (sometimes even perform, with a wooden puppet for instance) erotic and often kinky stories from the antique books in front of an all-male audience, those who are solvent enough to participate in the auction of these said salacious urtexts, that's where Fujiwara first lays his eyes on Lady Hideko. Another grand revelation finally sets straight its multi-buried subterfuge, in the Act III, where Park Chan-wook's unloosed endorsement of womanhood reaches its exuberant zenith, women are fêted by the abandon of sexual liberalization (under a vibrant pace) whereas men are doomed in their Freudian subservience (heightened by an overt self-referential appearance of a giant octopus, Park's trademark metaphor of pervert and ruination). Leading lady Kim Min-hee impeccably holds court here, conveying a tangy impression of Goddess finesse mingled with unpredictability, mystique, and empathy, her ageless countenance adorned by the gorgeous period costume and make-up, cogently embodies the most alluring quality of oriental feminism, paired with a ludic but emboldened Kim Tae-ri, their resultant eye-popping soft-core sex sequences dare to give BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (2013) a run for its money. Ha Jung-woo, the superstar of South Korean cinema, dutifully deploys a broader touch to transmit a tinge of caricature and incredulity in a supporting job that elicits our sympathy even when on paper, his character shouldn't.Inveterately operatic, ravishingly sumptuous, THE HANDMAIDEN tops off a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp with an absolutely captivating momentum which leaves its rapt audience feel triumphant and thoroughly justified, all by dint of Park's upmarket artistry, aesthetic sensibility and gallant vision."
" Truly ""human beings in their vilest form""

In the end, it is not worth watching. This is not something I want to remember or have in my head. If you think about it, why would you want to live a dark and tortuous life like that and why would anyone want to create a film to encourage people to bring such a thing to reality.

This is the best movie I have seen in 2017 and one of the best movies ever.I read a lot of reviews and noticed that while some reviewers where disturbed by female sexuality and pleasure, calling this movie pornographic, nobody even mentions being offended by the torture scene which for me was the one part of the movie I had to look away from. (it is very brief and important to the story so you can just hide your eyes as I did if these things disturb you) Most of all this is a story about love. The two scenes that stood out for me had nothing to do with sex or violence. One is a simple scene that happens on a road where you see two souls connect. Another happens in a library where you see one character express and liberate another character from so much pain and degradation. Simply a beautiful film in every way and a must see."

It presents devious men who misuse and abuse women, but it reveals more about devious women who misuse and abuse each other. The movie is beautifully filmed, but not so well edited.

" She gives a five star performance
",0.0,0.9978,2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"This review of The Handmaiden is spoiler free ***** (5/5)IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT to imagine the thoughts of a big-name filmmaker such as Park Chan-wook. He's optimistic to say the least, and this has lead him to become a Korean cinema mastermind, just by a few films that have shocked audiences all over the world, he's been called a genius. It's given his films a particular high-standard, whether they're thrillers, Oldboy or whether it's a sexy vampire story, Thirst. He's good at thrilling his audience no matter the genre. His previous film, Stoker, his English-language debut and his first foray into Hollywood, went beyond all that; he added a new feature by going beyond the mark with sexual content. It had a scene where Mia Wasikowska's burgeoning villain, masturbated joyfully after the assassination of her attempted rapist. That was sex on a smaller scale; his latest The Handmaiden involves that scene on a much larger scale, think Blue Is The Warmest Colour, that's this film in a nutshell. Inspired by Sarah Waters' crime novel Fingersmith, this powerful Byzantine-esque tale is a picturesque journey of a lowly pickpocket who is employed by a powerful Seoul con-man to defraud a wealthy Japanese heiress out of her money, during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1930s. It's a voluptuously stunning tale of love, sex, violence, and vengeance, at 2 hours an 24 minutes it is a slightly episodic endeavour of vengeance but it's gorgeous every scene from inside the mansion or outside in the gardens is presented like the number one painting exhibit at The Louvre, even the luridly mesmerizing intimate times are like a painting, thanks to Chung Chung-hoo's cinematography. Told over three chapters, each set with a purpose, which most of the time ends up with somebody getting hurt it's an irresistible tale of wonder and joy. We open with Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) a young pickpocket who is employed by a con-man, Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) to work for a wealthy Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) as a handmaiden, while he tries to seduce her into marriage. But it later transpires that Count Fujiwara isn't the man who he says he is, he's self-indulgent in many ways and also he plans to put young Sook-hee in jail for thievery. She, however, has different plans she starts to fall in love with Hideko, and as their love gets stronger to a point she's then taken away.At which point she forms an elaborate plan for vengeance, it's a while before this plan comes to play and when it does Chan-wook isn't afraid to steer away from the material. He presents himself as a cinematic thesp by creating his characters around turmoil, pain, suffering and emotion. The film is fiery at this point getting faster as every minute is an irresistible moment, towards vengeance. Meanwhile, intercutting flashbacks of Hideko's life growing up with her narcissistic uncle and her insane auntie and how they taught her to read erotica with proper diction around an audience of perverted elderly men. Sure it's a perverse moment, but it's still equally mesmerizing there are plenty of those moments that evolve this film and each one is better than the last. In addition, it's frankly sexual, horrifically violent, and voluptuously stunning.When the final thrill comes to play it shows that Sook-hee has planned her moment of shine well, it's a non-bullsh*t thrill which involves a lot of pain, a giant octopus on the wall, pollution from smoking and ultimately a stunning shot of Sook-hee and Hideko tearing up a studio in the home. This is lifted with perfect execution, it's almost too hard to look away from beauty of love (which is the message this film gives). The Handmaiden is sybaritic yet luridly mesmerizing down to its final moments that are executed perfectly, it's a joy. It's Chan-wook's best film in years that will stand the test of time. VERDICT: A part Oldboy, a bit like Stoker with a part Blue Is The Warmest Colour makes this is a cinematic masterpiece of the ages."
" Beautiful imagery, disappointing content

The manipulation of colour is done masterfully as well.But other than that I had trouble finding any substance to the film. I enjoyed some scenes, the interaction between actors, but most of them did not feel real so I didn't really take anything from it.There are several slow parts where scenes are replayed from a different perspective and it's mostly interesting for the sexual discovery the characters partake. Actually, there is not much to it other than the sex.It was okay, different from what I usually watch, but I was expecting something more special, especially after watching such an amazing trailer."

It's a complicated layered story of con artists and deviants, but there are many aspects to it all. There's humour, scares, romance, eroticism and suspense. Lots of twists add up to make a film that really you don't know what to expect next with. It's excellent. It's all shot brilliantly in Chan-Wook Park's philosophical style. Each shot is picturesque. It's wonderful to look at, the music is wonderful and the storyline is engrossing. The motley crue of characters have some great depth to them that you are just intrigued. I've just watched the extended version, so I'm reviewing that here. It's very graphic sexually so be careful on taking a date to this film. If you're liberally-minded, then you'll really enjoy this. It's erotic and sometimes crude, but never really offensive. It is actually also a criticism of certain forms of sexual abusive behaviour, and that's intriguing. It's a wonderful film, and another in what is marking the director to be amongst the finest directors I've ever encountered. I can't recommend his work highly enough. Give it a try."

For the rest, I found the film far too long with all these flashbacks, there is a time when I got lost in the story, so what bothered me the most and without being a prude, It was all these scenes more than erotic and quasi pornographic that irritated me, there was way to make a film simply erotic without being saturated by all these scenes far too daring that for me have spoiled the film, i am sure many have enjoyed these lesbian scenes, if i had wanted to see a porn, i would have tapped a believe me and i saw with the years, so the choice is not that the scenes shocked me in As such, was that they did not have to be so daring, in short, as their opinions are said to each one. I can nevertheless also point out that the actors were very good in their respective roles. In conclusion, a superb realization, beautiful scenery and beautiful pictures, which make me put a 7/10 nevertheless .."

With lots of twists sometimes movies become boring and feels that the writer is trying too hard but no not this one. Everything falls in it's place perfectly. The style of story telling with non-linear narrative lends it a fitting way to convey the story. All the actors are stupendous, couldn't have played their part any better. Specially the Handmaiden, for me it was love at the first sight. Her innocence, beauty and smile took my heart away. Similarly the Lady Hideko played her part with utmost perfection . The Villains also come out and deliver a perfect performance. Talking about cinematography ; it is picture perfect, the color combination sometimes remind one of Wes Anderson . The Music too is crafted in a suitable manner and makes it more emotionally charged and gives it a strong feel. I usually don't just praise a movie but point out what I thought was missing but sorry this time there is nothing I think about. If you want to see a sensual, dramatic, unpredictable movie this is perfect treat for you. They don't make it like this anymore."
" Park Chan-wook always delivers
",0.0,0.9775,2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"As an unconditional Park Chan-wook fan i was very eager to see the Handmaiden and i was not disappointed. It tells a story of a maid who agrees (alongside a con artist) to work for a young woman who is about to inherit a substancional amount of money and at the same time brainwash her to marry the con artist so he can put the young woman in a mental facility and get the fortune for himself, and a small portion of money for the maid of course. But the plan goes sour when the maid starts to develop feelings for the young woman and regrets what she's doing to her. It's a wonderful movie, but when the second part of the story starts its when things really begin to heat up and then you can clearly see that this is truly a Park Chan-Wook film that it's not far from he's master piece ""vengeance trilogy"". Without spoil ling to anyone the ending myth surprise some of the die-hard fans of Park's early work because it's a different end from the rest of he's movies, but don't get me wrong it's a perfect end it's just a 180º from what i was expecting.

" A sick and bizarre hymn of womanly love
",-0.1027,0.1734,2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"A con story gone wild, that's another way to summarize what The Handmaiden is about. In between these two short formulas, there's a story no description would be able to do proper justice. It would defy your expectations and keep you puzzled about what's actually going on and what's to happen next. This ability to surprise is The Handmaiden's most undeniable quality, and that alone makes this film worth watching.There's, however, a certain ""anime"" flavor to this story. No, not in the sense that the characters have disproportionately big eyes or hyperbolized emotions. The characters' emotions here are pretty well-explained, but the events that cause them are often contrived beyond any rational explanation. Especially when it comes to people's greed, violence and perversion. As if the film tries to take us aback by flummoxing and mesmerizing us with its explicit and graphic nature, so that we obediently submit ourselves to its cinematographic will.But while the entourage of this story, taking place in Korea during the Japanese occupation, is indeed captivating and colorful, there's a certain ""modern replica"" feeling about it. And not just because it is inspired by a book released in 2002 but whose events take place in Victorian Era England. It's the whole concept of womanly love that can be vicious and cruel to conquer all, something that our society found a taste for only recently. This concept has everything in it to haunt our minds and become a true icon of our generation, but with The Handmaiden it felt neither entirely fresh nor entirely genuine. The world already has Blue is the Warmest Color and Gone Girl. If not for them, The Handmaiden might have been groundbreaking. But now, it feels too much like those two stories intermixed, with an octopus added for a graphic effect. To a stimulated bidder, this book could still be sold high. But it still doesn't make up for a difference between an original and an artfully crafted fake."
" Wonderful new film by Korean auteur Park Chan-wook
",0.5719,0.995,2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Like many North American films fans, I discovered Park Chan-Wook's work through his 2003 breakout Oldboy. He has continued to make great films like Thirst, I'm A Cyborg (But That's OK), and his American film debut Stoker, but I have felt that known of his films have packed the same punch as JSA and the Vengeance Trilogy until 2016's the Handmaiden.The Handmaiden is adapted from the novel the Fingersmith by Sarah Waters, and tells the story of a woman named Sook-hee, who takes up an offer from her employer Count Fujiwara to become the titular handmaiden for the very rich Lady Hideko, so that the Count can get into Hideko's good graces, and eventually marry Hideko in place of her uncle usurp her fortune, and have her committed. What he does not anticipate is that the two ladies will fall in love, and eventually plot against him.The film has what could be a simple period set story told in a deeply complex way. The story is split into 3 acts told from each of the 3 main characters perspectives so that certain segments are repeated from the perspective of each character, so they are understood in different ways. Chan-wook has created a lush, gorgeous atmosphere to set his story in, and even in the film's slower moments (in the late 2nd act for example), the film is stunning to behold. The performances from the main cast, are always deep from the written to the physical.This brings me to the sex scenes which like Blue is the Warmest Color have taken on a note of notoriety for their explicit nature. They certainly are explicit for a film that could qualify for a sort of mainstream film, but they do feel central to the plot, as both characters come from positions where they have been dominated by men their entire existence, and are using these moments not just as sexual expression, but as moments where they are able to take control of their own existence."

It proves that with lust, and hot unexpected erotic passion that leads to emotions that new life and love is possible for two ladies.Set in 1930's Korea a young woman Sook-Hee(Tae-Ri Kim)is hired to be a new handmaiden for Lady Hideko(Min-Hee Kim)who's a Japanese heiress who's lives on an estate by the country and the palace is a castle spread like with many books to read and much to learn like the arts which involve hand painting. However it's a secret plot that Sook-Hee has with a con man known as the count and that is to defraud Hideko of her large inheritance.Thru it all the film has visions of doubt, trust, and the elements of love and hot erotic passion is taken into new heights as the emotions brought out with Lady Hideko and Sook-Hee twist this plot and little cat and mouse game for a spin and turn that you and even the count didn't see coming.

" A visually beautiful erotic masterpiece from South Korea's brilliant Park Chan-wook
",0.9153,0.994,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"South Korea has produced some of the world's most creative and exciting works of cinema since the century began, and Park Chan-wook (of ""Oldboy"" and ""Thirst"" fame) is one of its most acclaimed filmmakers. Still, knowing that, nothing prepared me for ""The Handmaiden"", unquestionably Park's masterpiece to date, and even perhaps the finest film to ever come out of that country.Born and raised in Seoul, Park was determined to be an art critic until his first viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" which dictated the rest of his life. In 2013, Park actually made a twisted, stylized loose remake of Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt' (called ""Stoker"" with Nicole Kidman, his only English language film) but whereas that movie was somewhat inconsistent albeit visually lush, ""The Handmaiden"" is perfectly realized, the framing of every shot and the rhythm of its pacing fully controlled in structure and tone, and executed with such an exquisite sense of visual beauty in its production design, costumes and cinematography (as well as the aesthetic beauty of its cast) that virtually every frame of this film could be hung on the wall of an art museum.Adapted from Fingersmith, a Welsh novel by Sarah Waters, the film is set in the Japan-occupied South Korea of the 1930s as if its characters and setting had been lifted out of Henry James' Victorian England. Divided into a three-part structure, it tells of a handmaiden hired to a young Japanese heiress who lives a secluded life on a large Dickensian estate with her dominating Uncle -- but the intricate plot that develops has more twists than a Philadelphia pretzel, with scheming and swindling, double-crossings and betrayal, as well as explicit lesbian sex (and a small dose of shocking violence). What makes it all so engrossing is the three-part construct which allows its events to double back on themselves (a la Quentin Tarantino), keeping viewers constantly off balance as new twists become slowly revealed like layers falling off in the peeling of an onion. All of this is in the service of a high class, richly poetic work of cinematic art, one that is as intelligent and sophisticated as it is intense and erotic, a film displaying no less than the most gorgeous images of the year in cinema. Not to be missed.(One added note: I was lucky enough to view a special extended director's cut of this film in an art cinema which ran 167 minutes, adding 23 minutes to the theatrical 144-minute version. Although much of the additional footage was of totally explicit sexual activity, these scenes were shot with such taste and poetic beauty that it was never exploitative or offensive, to this viewer anyway. Both cuts are equally recommended -- the regular theatrical version more of a thriller; the longer one more of a romance.)"
" The Handmaiden is an excellent erotic psychological thriller with twisty screenplay,terrific direction and performances.
",0.6249,0.9956,2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"The Handmaiden (2016): Most of the erotic thrillers of recent times failed to impress because the makers are only focusing on ridiculous sex scenes than the plot.I have watched only few erotic thrillers like Poison Ivy,Basic Instinct and Unfaithful.The Handmaiden,a South Korean film got universal acclaim and I had huge expectations on Korean films especially after watching The Wailing.The Handmaiden is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Park Chan Wook.So how is The Handmaiden?Plot: 1930s Korea, in the period of Japanese occupation, a new girl Sookee (Tae-re Kim) is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress Hideko (Kim Min-hee) who lives a secluded life on a large countryside estate with her domineering Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo). But the maid has a secret. She is a pickpocket recruited by a swindler posing as a Japanese Count (Jung-woo Ha) to help him seduce the Lady to elope with him, rob her of her fortune, and lock her up in a madhouse. The plan seems to proceed according to plan until Sookee and Hideko discover some unexpected emotions.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: The Handmaiden is brilliantly crafted erotic psychological thriller with great twists and turns.Movie is told in 3 parts and all of the parts have great thrills and emotion.Movie starts as drama and later takes a twist at the end of Part 1 and in the second part we get lot of twists which gives us meaning of unanswered questions in Part 1.Park Chan Wook did an commendable job in directing those picture.He cleverly managed to tell a simple revenge in an interesting manner.2)Performances: New comer Tae-re Kim did splendidly well in a challenging role.Debuting in a intimate role is not a great start but she did it and scored big and her sexually inexperienced heiress, a layered turn from Kim Min-hee.Kin-Woong Jo as Uncle Kouzuki is impressive.3)Background Score: The Handmaiden has haunting score which elevated lot of scenes.It provided a creepiness feel to the scenes.The music during sex scenes are seducing.4)Cinematography: The film is beautifully shot with rich visuals and greenery locations.Minus Points:1)Amount of Sex and Nudity: The Handmaiden has lot of explicit sex scenes which may disturb few audience but more importantly, there's longing, affection and intimacy between the maid, and her sexually inexperienced heiress.So,The Handmaiden is an excellent erotic psychological thriller with twisty screenplay,terrific direction and performances.My rating 8.25/10"

Chan-wook directed and co- wrote the movie, with Jeong Seo-kyeong (a frequent writing collaborator of his). The script is loosely based on the novel 'Fingersmith', by Sarah Waters, with the Victorian era setting changed to Japanese-occupied Korea. It tells the story of a conman that hires a pickpocket, to pose as a handmaiden for a depressed Japanese heiress, in order to rob her (through an elaborate plot). The movie stars Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri and Ha Jung-woo. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also won, or been nominated for, several prestigious awards. I enjoyed it.The story is set in Korea, at the time it was under Japanese colonial rule. A conman, going by the name of Count Fujiwara (Jung- woo), hires a pickpocket, named Sook-hee (Tae-ri), to pose as a handmaiden for a severely depressed Japanese heiress, named Lady Hideko (Min-hee). Fujiwara plots to marry Hideko, and then have her committed to an insane asylum; in order to steal her fortune. He enlists Sook-hee to help him. Sook-hee agrees to the plan, but then she develops feelings for the heiress. Things only become more complicated from there!The film is a great female empowerment love story, it's also (once again) beautifully shot, and masterfully edited, by Chan-wook (I love his visual style). The screenplay is also brilliant; and although it starts out slow, it becomes really involving. It's also full of really passionate, and quite erotic, sex scenes. If that's your thing, it's full of them; but it is all part of the story (and rich character development). It's also one of the highest rated movies of 2016, by many critics, and I can see why.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps"
" Made with a lot of class
",0.0,0.9965,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I have only seen one previous Chan-wook Park film ('Oldboy') and it just so happened it was one of the finest films I have ever seen. I've always planned to see more of his work, but sometimes find it hard to get motivated to watch foreign language films. However, when I saw he had released a film in 2016 which was getting a positive response I decided I had to check it out. 'The Handmaiden' is quite a different tale to 'Oldboy', yet it's told with equal measures of class. Park makes terrific looking films with amazing attention to detail and has an incredible ability to intrigue and fascinate an audience with the complex and intricate stories he tells.'The Handmaiden' is mostly a love story, partly a mystery and partly a violent thriller. The story is told in three parts. We are told a story, then asked to question everything we have seen, and then given an explanation of sorts. Throughout all of this we are being treated to some wonderful acting, direction and writing. It truly is a wonderfully put together film.In some ways this film may alienate a portion of its audience. People who like romances and love stories don't often tend to enjoy high levels of violence. Conversely, those who do enjoy high levels of violence and a mystery/thriller element to their films, don't often have the patience or desire to sit through what is at its heart a love story. This is the only problem I can see this film having. As long as you're able to get past that side of things, you're going to have a good time with this one."
" The art of eroticism
",0.0,0.9971,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"''The Handmaiden'' is a mesmerizing period drama that convinces with a twisted story, gloomy settings, an atmospheric score, precise cinematography, profound characters and incredible acting performances. It consists of three parts, the first two leading to clever twists and the last one to a satisfactory conclusion that leaves no questions unanswered if you watch carefully. The story is set in Japanese-occupied Korea and tells the story of a thief's daughter who is collaborating with a clever crook in order to steal the inheritance of a rich Japanese lady living in seclusion with her perverted uncle. Telling you anything more would take away from the movie's brilliant storytelling.The movie has a slow pace but develops a melancholic atmosphere right from the start with the very first scene until the final freeze frame. Despite a few necessary repetitions in the story due to a few shifts in perspective, the movie passed surprisingly quickly despite a running time of nearly two and a half hours.The story is clever and emotional with its twists and turns. Some twists are hard to predict while others are easier to figure out and others again aren't directly revealed throughout the movie but they are all told carefully, elegantly and profoundly. This movie doesn't only stimulate your genitals and your heart but also your brain.The film should only be watched by mature adults since it includes a lot of eroticism. The movie carefully contrasts cold sexual abuse and passionate romance in a balanced way. This isn't only done by performing credible sexual intercourse in front of the camera. This is also told through facial expressions, quotes from erotic novels and appropriate settings. While more conservative minds could be shocked, one should note that every single scene adds to the clever story and the depth of the characters. This movie doesn't include any sexual innuendo and no pornographic movie could even slightly achieve what this movie does. This is truly a lesson in eroticism performed by highly skilled actors and actresses and this combination makes this movie stand out.In the end, the combination of intense emotions, profound eroticism and an intelligent story in a movie involving outstanding actors and actresses and directed by one of the world's best directors makes this one of the very best period dramas ever made in the history of cinema. Not only genre fans will adore this movie but any adult with a genuine interest in cinema should watch this contemporary masterpiece."
" If goospimples are your thing, this film will hand it to you in spades.
",0.4939,0.9909,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"No spoilers...Oh my. I was a big fan of UK dramatisation, ""The Fingersmith"" so was a little worried about ""Ahgassi"" translating across the sea. I was primarily concerned with the issue of conservatism over there, especially in Korea where censorship can be quite harsh at times. I honestly did not expect the full-on, pretty much nothing left to the imagination rendition of a rather graphic novel. Bravo!My worries were unfounded: not only was Park Chan-wook able to convey the imagery convincingly, the rather complex story-in-two-parts translated wonderfully. The timeline (30's occupied Korea) the utterly sumptuous settings of the Japanese/European style mansion amidst the almost desolate beauty of the countryside and finally, The strong, character driven story lines acted out by a first rate, suitably gorgeous cast.As a Japanese speaker, I found the Japanese half of the movie to be blissfully well acted and the Japanese convincing enough, considering the Korean cast... However I was forced to rely on some sub-par subtitling for the Korean half having only sparing knowledge.Finally, having the original novel and the UK screen version to compare against, If found that the story told here was as triumphant and thoroughly heart-warming ode to trust as was the original and so well adapted to the Korean 30's that it felt truly in place in the sumptuous sets and in the hands of the gorgeous cast."
" It doesn't get better than 'The Handmaiden'.
",-0.3412,0.9965,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Park Chan-wook is already a legendary filmmaker in pretty much every circle and he's only 53 years old. With films like the original 'Oldboy', 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', 'Thirst', and 'Stoker', it's easy to say that Park Chan-wook is a master of his domain and film. Fortunately for everyone who loves film, his new movie 'The Handmaiden', based off 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters is not just a film, but an experience in cinema and will be forever etched in you memory for all the right reasons.In 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook has perfectly conjured up a mix of a 1930's drama, comedy, horror, suspense, and a bathtub full of sex and tentacles. Most filmmakers would have a very difficult time making a classy artsy film with these subjects, let alone, combining all of these aspects, but Park Chan-wook has done it effortlessly. Set in Korea in the 1930s, a suave crook named Count Fujiwara has hired a young woman named Sook-hee, and has trained her to be a pick-pocket and con- artist, in order to make the mysterious, strange, and very wealthy Lady Hideko fall in love, in order to taker all of her jewels and money.Sook-hee goes undercover as Hideko's new handmaiden in order to help her fall in love more with Count Fujiwara. Something unexpected happens when Hideko and Sook-hee end up falling for each other, much to the dismay to Hideko's sadistic black tongued uncle. There are so many layers to this film and each of its characters that during the 145 minute run-time, you get the story basically three times, told in different perspectives, with each new look, revealing a darker and more sexual side to each character and compelling clues to the ever going mystery of just what is taking place at this beautiful estate.Needless to say, it isn't all puppy dogs and beautiful flowers. With some of the darker images and actions that take place in 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook uses his camera in a very elegant way and never in a harsh movement, making every bit of debauchery or lovemaking seem innocent. 'The Handmaiden' is one of the better films in a long time and there is absolutely no other film like it.MUST-SEE!"
" An overlooked masterpiece.
",0.6124,0.998,2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"THE HANDMAIDEN is a great film. It seems to glow with creativity and beauty with each new scene, and during the entirety of its over 2 hour run time I found myself entranced by a slow-churning mystery that left me once again excited by the craft a good movie can make appear so easy.The film is a South Korean production helmed by director Chan-wook Park, known mostly in America as the director of 'Oldboy.' People often say that foreign films demonstrate a higher quality in comparison to the stuff of Hollywood; that stories are daring and the craft is not as pressured by executives who would rather turn a profit than make something truly substantial. Did they ever get it right.The movie is a period piece that is lush in costumes and sets. Each new shot paints a picture on the screen that simply pulls one into the world of South Korea in the 1930's. The cinematography, a lush landscape of vibrant hues and meticulous staging, keeps us engaged as though by hypnotism. The story follows three people, each scheming in their own right, telling the audience information that might only be a passing thought in their mind. In the simplest form, the story is of a conman who hopes to rob a wealthy woman (Lady Hideko) of her inheritance by feigning love with her and posing as a Count. Once married, he will find her mentally unsound and throw her in a mental institution, leaving him to bask in a newfound fortune. In order to make the most of his plan, he sends a maid (another con artist named Sook-Hee) to infiltrate the Lady's home and gain information and insight into the mind of the woman.The film opens with a scene of forgers and thieves who meet to hear the ""Count's"" plan. He runs a business of sorts, forging money, legal papers, and jewelry. He promises them a cut of the fortune assuming they can help pass himself off as a man of means. Sook- Hee, for her troubles, is promised $50,000 and a new wardrobe once Hideko is institutionalized. She is a simple girl, illiterate, but the prospects are insatiable.In the night, she takes a car ride down the coastline to the estate of Lady Hideko, a grand estate built in two parts: one half designed as though an English mansion, and another half in traditional Japanese style. It's truly East meets West, and the blatant metaphor of clashing cultures and ideas only becomes more potent as the story progresses.Lady Hideko lives on the estate with her elderly uncle, a man who uses an ink pen so fervently that his tongue is stained black. He is a collector of antique literature and texts which are entirely erotic in nature, and uses Hideko to recite the texts to potential buyers who frequent the mansion in hopes of bidding on what is essentially pornography. We learn about her past, raised by her Uncle in a disciplinarian manner, losing her aunt to a suicide as a child, and an eternal fear of ever leaving the confines of the estate. For Sook- Hee, the innocent maid come to spy on her, it might already seem like a mental institute is not too far off.As these two women begin to know each other, they become friendly, with Hideko using Sook-Yee to model her clothes and confine dark secrets in the privacy of her room. Sook- Yee, who sees the potential wealth she will soon inherit, seems hypnotized by the beauty of her boss, and in some of the most beautiful moments of glances and gestures, we can see a dark romance forming between the two women.The story is broken up into three parts, and to venture in even discussing the array of twists and turns would do no favors to the structure of the story, so expertly-written and brilliant that at any one time we may have flashbacks within flashbacks told simply to act as footnote to a line of dialogue or interpret the actions of a character. Never are we lost or in over our heads; this is a masterpiece of story and style. In fact, Part 2 nearly replays the entire first act of the film but through the perspective of an entirely different character. Scenes are repeated in their entirety and yet the insight we gain only leads towards understanding of the next moment, and the next...The movie is based on an English crime novel called ""Fingersmith,"" and we can see how this story could easily be (at first glance) a serial crime novel with a predictable plot. The story is tense at times and deeply erotic at others, showing these two women in moments of ultimate vulnerability and strength, sometimes in the same instance. I would expect many audience members to be offput by the graphic nature of several scenes, and yet I can do nothing but praise the artistic endeavors to use sex on film as a means to tell an emotional story.The Academy Awards have created a shortlist of potential nominees for Best Foreign Film, a list that does not include 'The Handmaiden' (South Korea instead nominated a film called 'The Age of Shadows'). It's a shame that a movie as wonderful as this could be looked over, even if by technicality that a country needs to pick one film only to represent it. The soundtrack is haunting, the story compelling, the look is heavenly. I know I will see many more films as the Fall rolls along, and yet I know that when I come to make a list of my favorite films of the year, this is now the one to beat."
" Asian Cinema At Its Very Finest
",0.0,0.9921,2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"""The Handmaiden"" is a deeply romantic story full of erotic tension, but also a highly intelligent thriller. It is told in three parts, with countless conspiracies and turns. Everything that you think you know, will turn out in an unexpected way. But not only the story convinced me. The visuals are outstanding and the general look of the film is close to perfection. That is cinematography at its best. The music of the film is fitting and contributes to the great atmosphere. The only weakness of this movie are its overacted and sometimes silly male characters. But the main focus lies on the two female protagonists, who are convincing. For me, this film is a must-watch for fans of Asian cinema and everyone else, who is into new exciting ways to tell great stories on the big screen."
" Tedious, long winded, beautifully shot
",0.5719,0.9882,2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"""The Handmaiden"" is a fairly tedious, hard-to-follow art movie.It looks great, like a photography book come to life... sort of. But just because it's nice to look at, doesn't mean it's fun to watch.The story is told in three parts, each introduced by an on-screen title. The movie goes back and forth on the timeline a bit.It's so long-winded in parts that I stopped caring who everyone was and what they were doing. This is anathema in any movie, but more so for one that fills you in after the fact. I am generally loath to assume that the only reason someone says they like an adults only movie is because of the sex. Here, I have to make an exception. Yes, it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes - though not much compared to ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"". And yes, this lesbianism is between two pretty, young Korean actresses.Supposedly, at least most guys love to see women make out, and most of them also have a preference for Asian women. I realise I am an anomaly in not being that excited by either. And take the sex out of the movie, and what do you have?A photography book you'd enjoy flipping through, but not enough of a story to make you want to take it home."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9965,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Handmaiden"" (2016) was without the doubt one of the best movies from 2016 I've seen. This is a multi-layered story which involves - love, sex, cons, mystery and a little bit of violence. Before seeing this movie i kinda thought it would be slow paces story which will probably involve all above mentioned things, but boy oh boy surely i wasn't prepared for how this movie is great. If anything else, this movie isn't slow paced - at running time 2 h 15 min. it is a brilliantly crafted highly involving story. Directing, writing, cinematography were first rate as well as acting and set design. The story itself was very intriguing, but its the brilliant movie craftsmanship that made ""The Handmaiden"" into one of the best movies I've seen whole year (2016).Overall, ""The Handmaiden"" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys great films (but not for the youngest ones as it shows some explicit sex scenes). It is a very beautifully filmed story, not predictable or boring for a second (!) and a highly involving one. Brilliant picture."

Anything someone is looking in a movie he will find here. i truly hope this movie will go for and be enjoyed by manny viewers..i must say that it contains a lot of one on one nude girl power but its only to tell the beautiful story between the girls! i read also that the movie its from a book ..i am so glad he made the adaption between two countries that share a past like Japan and Korea' I am very ignorant so after the movie i started to google about the real handmaiden there. over all grate picture ..frame after frame i never took my eyes off of it"
