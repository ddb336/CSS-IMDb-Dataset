" Proud to be an American
",0.4767,0.9913,2021-03-19 00:00:00,9,"If ever you believed in the Constitution of the United states of America or what it meant to truly be an upstanding lawyer that cared about your rights under the Constitution,then this moving depiction of real life Lawyer and advocate for the American way of life James Donovan will remind you that you live in the greatest country in the world. Tom Hanks plays the real life lawyer Donovan responsible for defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance, in 1957 Cold war America after he is captured and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. This story captures the American Way of Life and how important our Constitution and Due Process of law is needed to protect us all, native and immigrant,from a Government that might just want to see such an individual as Rudolf Able executed instead of given the freedom of a fair trial. Until I saw this movie I had reached an opinion of Lawyer's in general as all corruptible. I stand corrected, James Donovan was a true hero who lost his reputation because of his continual fight and defense for the unalienable rights of a Russian Spy. He saved face though and was reputed and redeemed when his choices proved to be the right thing to do and he was responsible for the return of Rudolph Able back to the KGB in exchange for captured a USA Pilot Gary Powers and a captive USA Student. Another great Spielberg Creation despite its lowest Grossing film to date. A must see if you ever wanted to be a lawyer, believed in your constitution or what it meant to be an American.
James Donovan went on to work for John F. Kennedy as an Iternational Diplomatic Negotiator and negotiate the release of 9703 Men in Women and children in 1963 following the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba.-"

" First of all - it's not a spy movie
",0.0,0.965,2021-03-06 00:00:00,6,"About spies? Yes. But a spy movie? No.
If you're looking for something like ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" or ""The Good Shepherd"" you won't find it here. It's rather judicial drama about a counselor and his meditations. Still a fairly good movie though, like 6/10. With great scenography."
" A great spy thriller!
",0.6996,0.9939,2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Spielberg and Hanks, what more could a movie fan want? Individually the two rarely miss the mark with their projects. Stick them together and the results are often sensational. I wouldn't class Bridge of Spies as sensational, but it is a gripping, stylish and engaging thriller nonetheless.The story is remarkable and one that I'm very glad to have learned about. We follow Hanks' lawyer James Donovan as his case to defend an alleged Soviet spy drags him deep into the Cold War. There are some great themes explored, and the performances are exceptional. Hanks is a cut above the rest and delivers his dialogue with such sharpness and wit. Bridge of Spies really is all about the dialogue, which is always excellent. Don't go in expecting an action packed thriller. This is more John le Carre esque, playing out like a game of chess.My only criticisms of this film would be that it never quite reached the heights I was expecting or hoping for. The level of peril always felt quite low. I was hooked don't get me wrong, but the ending felt fairly obvious and as a result there was no great danger or suspense. Then there were the characters. I wasn't that enamoured with any of them. The film was more about the events and how they unfolded, and characterisation and development appeared to take a back seat.Aside from this, everything about Bridge of Spies was great. The direction from Spielberg was expectedly fantastic, Hanks was so magnetic and watchable, and the score, sets and costumes set a brilliant tone and style for the film.Very enjoyable and most definitely worth a watch."
" OK but not great.
",-0.5384,0.8393,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"The film has very good production values and is slick, of course, after all it is Spielberg. But I was surprised to find out Ethan Coen was one of the two script authors, as I find the script too traditional and too safe, presenting a rather romanticized, simplified, naive version of that era and people. The film is much more Spielberg than Coen brothers. 7 out of 10 for me."

" Give him an Oscar 2015
",0.0,0.9442,2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Tom Hanks, how awesome you are, you deserve an Oscar.
Mark Rylance, yes, you are the Oscar.There are two scenes for two different walls
A safe and stable homeland, and another broken and dividedLet's put a question:
Is there a fair trial for the spy?
The answer:
Anyone deserves to be defended, because anyone's life matters
And anyone deserves decent treatment as a human being.(Law is the only means of justice for human beings, and for preserving their humanity).When the world tightens and you are surrounded by the sharp and critical gazes of people, just because you are a doer of principle that you see from your point of view that nothing disgraces your position, will you remain steadfast in your position even if this position costs you the security of your family or contempt for your neighbors, or will you swim with the current and submit to the pressures of your society ..Do what you think is right without looking at the considerations made by others. It takes two kinds of boldness, the first is your boldness necessary to make a decision, and the second is your boldness necessary to take responsibility for your decisions."
" Bridge of Spies is divided into 2 parts
",0.0,0.9244,2020-12-19 00:00:00,4,"Bridge of Spies is divided into 2 parts. The first time the action takes place in the United States, excellent judicial drama. With a slow development of events, which is noteworthy completely without musical accompaniment (a rarity in modern cinema). The second part, this is already an action movie in the style of M (James Bond), where the whole action is accelerated and at least repel the turnover of musical accompaniment. And the second part is terrible. In the first, the USSR and the GDR are shown as barbarians. Great propaganda. The most important thing is how Spielberg fakes the facts. Berlin was bombed not by the USSR, but by the Allies. The USSR, on the contrary, helped restore the ruins of eastern Berlin. And finally Abel in the USSR was recognized as a hero and confirmed the status of a spy. And to talk about the light in which the GDR is represented does not have to, some kind of ghetto.
And most importantly, 2 part of the film is a natural B-movie, which you watch by inertia and only for the sake of acting by Tom Hanks."

" A Footnote of History that Captures the Danger of the Cold War
",-0.8074,0.9645,2020-11-29 00:00:00,8,"Bridge of Spies and its tale begins at the start of the Cold War. Our protagonist, James Donovan, is a American Lawyer tasked to defend captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Meanwhile, a U-2 spy plane pilot named Gary Powers is captured by the Soviet Union after being shot down during an aerial photo shoot. The CIA tasks James to negotiate a trade for Gary Powers in exchange for Rudolf Abel.The movie, unlike most other war inspired films, takes a more methodical take on the cold war. While this movie has a minuscule amount of action, its slow but intense escalation keeps watchers at the edge of their seat. Each scene effectively captures the tension of the cold war and redefines what it's like to be on the edge of global conflict. While at times slow, the movie still has powerful moments such as the scene within the court.The characters of this film, based on their real life characters, are played by amazing actors. James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, captures his character beautifully as he plays a role as a loving father and a professional lawyer. Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance, allows the viewer to see Abel as an intelligent, moral man who enjoys art rather than a malicious spy. Each character within the film plays an important part of the story and effectively drives the movie forward.The plot of the film is based of the real life events that took place during 1962. Bridge of Spies, although exaggerating some parts of the movie, follows the facts that occurs. Bridge of Spies allows us to see the events that occurred without adding anything unnecessary. The movie captures the essence of an Anti-Communist America that plays a huge role during Rudolf Abel's trial. This highlights Donovan's unyielding patriotism in which he believes Abel should stand fair trial despite the heavy backlash he is receiving. Abel within the movie shows the audience how effective of a spy he is by showing how little information there is against him in trial. The plot, while exaggerated, paints a picture of the cold war through the story it tells and the characters that play it.Bridge of Spies is an example of one of the Seven Revolutions: Conflict. During the beginning of the Cold war, Germany was divided into West and East Germany, U.S. owning the West and Soviet Union owning the East. Tensions rose when Soviets began to develop nuclear technology that threatened the U.S. Thus began the Cold War, a prime example of psychological warfare."
" Would it help if I worried?
",0.128,0.881,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. Cold War, historical things don't usually float my boat that much, but the story itself was very interesting and played very well.Based on real events, essentially it is about James Donovan's (Hanks) refusal to endure injustice, as he fights for the rights of Rudolf Abel (Rylance), back in 1957.
Later we learn that Donovan is almost as much of a humanitarian as Schindler with the work he does in Cuba, but we don't see that in this film, it's just interesting to see that he wouldn't be swayed by anything. He firmly believes in the law and stands by it.Both of the lead actors give outstanding performances, as you would expect and deliver a tale that could have been quite dull or something we've seen before.
It's funny how we have seen so many films these days that we have come to expect horrible things or sudden changes of circumstance to hit right at crucial moments and then we realise that it is a bio-pic and things don't always happen like that in real life. It actually adds to the tension and makes stories new again, because it changes the current formula of movies. Sometimes even when you know how the history actually turned out, you can still find yourself expecting the hero to be shot, even though you know he grows up to become the president or something?Based on the IMDB Trivia section, very few bits were added to flesh out the story and none of them really make much difference to how it made me feel, so you are getting quite a genuine interpretation of the events as the occurred.This film actually taught me a few things I didn't know, showing up huge gaps in my historic and geographic knowledge, but if you're more clever than me (It's not hard (That's what she said)) you may not experience this. I had no idea the USSR had control over East Germany and that's what the wall was all about, but then I did fail my Mock history exam and never turned up for the real thing. I shouldn't have taken all those days off school.I can't really say what made this one so good, but it's probably a lot of things all coming together as one, the filming, lighting, direction, sets, costume, all working collectively alongside the superb acting perhaps?"
" Lacks Subtlety
",0.0,0.9235,2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,"The script felt so in your face with plot and character development due to blockbuster mentality, the usual Spielberg (though there are exceptions). Rylance is such a pleasure to watch and it is a good, almost compelling story.I recommend this film but it should have been great and it is mediocre."
" Not Quite
",0.0,0.9652,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"I have enjoyed Tom Hanks' transition from average comedic actor to top line dramatic actor so the juices were flowing at the chance to watch him in a political/war drama.Unfortunately the film never really delivers the punch that it could have. I'm not talking about action bells and whistles rather, some scenes that really spark and capture the imagination. To get to the next level from ok or passable to good and then great a movie has to have an impact one way or another.Bridge of Spies whilst ok fails to deliver any note-worthy moments that could have propelled it to something special."
" Usual one-sided, color-deaf thing for Steven Spielberg
",0.0,0.5927,2020-09-15 00:00:00,7,But at least it's better than Atomic Blonde in any way possible.
" A Solid Bridge
",0.1531,0.823,2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"'Bridge of Spies' is a solid retelling of the Gary Powers incident, where a U.S. pilot was shot down over the Soviet Union while conducting reconnaisance at the height of the cold war. Powers was ultimately repatriated in a prisoner exchange, and the film is told from the perspective of the civilian lawyer who negotiated the deal. Tom Hanks plays the lead as an All-American, squared-jawed liberal lion, but the film is nicely nuanced, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Spileberg directs and the Cohen brothers wrote the script, so the film's basic competenace is hardly surprising; but it's nicely nuanced story with a Le Carre-esque mood, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Overall, it's an interesting portrait of a difficult time, and one with a rare happy ending where a negotiated solution stopped the cold war getting colder in a way that the world could little have afforded."
" Expertly crafted
",0.0,0.9875,2020-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Superb film!I love 'Bridge of Spies'. Every angle of it, at least from my point of view, is expertly crafted. The score by Thomas Newman is outstanding, the onscreen talent bring their a-game while the story is extremely riveting. It lasts for 141 minutes, it felt like 90 minutes tops; it absolutely flies through its run time, at no moment did I feel anything close to bored.Tom Hanks is brilliant in the lead role as Donovan, yet another great performance to add to his résumé. He rightly takes all the plaudits, but some must be left for Mark Rylance who is also brilliant as Abel. The support cast also more than pull their weight, too.Undeniably worth your time. Not sure how much of it is historically accurate (sounds like most is?), I honestly don't really care as it's a great film - which is what we are all here for after all."
" Golden Spielberg
",0.0,0.9484,2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"POSITIVES:1) Hanks and Rylance are both flawless. Every scene where they both feature is cinematic perfection
2) The character arc of Donovan (Hanks) is extremely endearing and engaging
3) As you'd expect from a Spielberg film, it is beautifully put together with fantastic cinematography and score
4) The opening half an hour and final half an hour are both mesmerisingNEGATIVES:1) The film is undoubtedly half an hour too long
2) It almost feels like two films wedged together; with the courtroom drama of the first 45 minutes quickly abandoned for the espionage thriller of the final 2 thirds
3) There are a couple of subplots that I found unnecessary and seemed to bloat the story; one example being the training sequences for Powers before he is captured"

It's interesting how the makers have laid emphasis to the little history of why the wall was being build in Berlin , why did they used to kill people when they used to cross the wall . As an audience you are inquisitive to know why this Is happening. Overall it's a must watch"
" Bridge of Boredom w/ BAD Camera 🎥 Work
",-0.7603,-0.8276,2020-08-13 00:00:00,2,"I'll make my review simple. This was the most BORING Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks production I have ever watched, especially when compared to some of their classic works. I really loathed all the camera shaking plus the constant zooming in and out during the film. It sure didn't make up for the lack of action in the movie. Absolutely nothing memorable happened! That's TWO and a HALF hours I'll never get back."
" A masterpiece for the entire staff.
",0.6249,0.9902,2020-08-06 00:00:00,10,"The script of this film has an unusual story structure.
That's because there is not much drama about the protagonist's inner conflict. Usually in a movie script, the core of the story is about how the main character gets over the problems he has in his mind. If you don't do that, the story usually doesn't hold up. But this movie is different. The protagonist doesn't have any problems inside himself. He just goes on with his mission, his belief in what he has to do, and his responsibility as a professional. This kind of scenario structure actually makes the script very difficult to write. But this writer, director, cameraman, actors, musicians and all the staffs pulled it off.
Analyzing the story, the story is divided into two parts. The first part ends about an hour in the film. As I was wondering what happens after that, a different mission comes up as part 2 and the protagonist moves towards it. And in that action, there is a challenging part that goes beyond the mission but it's important to do as a good human. That's what makes you want to cheer him on and that's the structure of the story. I think I learned from this film that people are shown by a noble challenge. I admire Kudos to Matt Charman, the screenwriter who wrote this.
And Tom Hanks was brilliant in the role. I applaud both Tom Hanks and the casting staff. I mentioned that the script is good, but the motivation for why the character in Germany has to be rescued, is not well written in the script. It takes the form of merely explaining it. Nevertheless, it works, because the character development of the protagonist is successful. Probably, if you only read the script of the second half of, you won't find it interesting. The audience can't sympathize with the protagonist's reckless charring. In order to make up for this weakness, I think they decided against the first scenario and add the beginning half. It was probably Spielberg who directed it. It must have been Spielberg who ordered it. No, let's say that it was definitely so. Spielberg is amazing."
" Could have been great..kinda a wasted potential
",-0.4939,0.9779,2020-07-28 00:00:00,7,"First thing it's not a bad movie it's beautiful,well shoot,great cinematography and astonishing performance by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance they have great chemistry together which we don't see a lot of it in the movie it's only a few scenes hands down they are the best in the movie I wish we had seen more of there scenes together..the movie despite the running time it feels like it wasn't enough we didn't know much about anything the spies like what rudoulf was doing why didn't see any ""spying"" in the movie it just little scene in the beginning..It had some comedic moments which was fine I really would rather it to be darker cause you know it's a cold war it's one of the most dark and interesting eras in human history..I didn't like so much that james donavon was a hero nothing stops him gets what he wants with little tiny troubles it felt not so realstic

" Interesting subject matter yet a lack of suspense
",0.128,0.9464,2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"Spielberg manages to create a film that is able to keep hold of your attention for its relatively bloated runtime, but only just. The true story is that of interest, especially if you are into the Cold War however a lack of memorable moments and a flat third act make it hard to recommend too strongly. Its a fine film, with good acting and excellent cinematography however it won't be something you rush to see again any time soon."

A humanitarian-filled New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is the Soviet intelligence officer Rudolph Abel (Mark Lilangs) defend. Even if the surroundings were full of various doubts, Donovan still upholds the principle of fairness, professional observance, and actively defended Abel. The reason why he is great is not only to do the job of a lawyer, but also to represent the American spirit full of respect for human rights.One of the most impressive scenes is the generous statement of lawyer Donovan facing the CIA agent:""Your Excellency, the Cold War is more than just a word, not just a metaphor. It is actually a competition between two competitors in the world.I want to say that Rudolph is our enemy in this war, he was regarded as a soldier in this war, knowing that the government thinks it is inappropriate to treat him like this, so he did not get the treatment of American citizens, he got Suitable for the enemy, but inappropriate for the suspect.I understand this person. If the accusation is true, he is loyal to foreign forces, but on a voluntary basis, if he is a soldier of the enemy, he is a good soldier. He did not serve as a deserter to save his life. He refused to take refuge with the captive. He refused to betray his creed, he refused to be a coward, and the coward must have given up his dignity before deserting. Rudolph would never do this.Shouldn't we show this person by giving him all the rights that the national judicial system gives to the individual? Who are we?

I so enjoy a historical/legal drama and this movie certainly satisfies in that arena. Tom Hanks is brilliant as the attorney who becomes progressively enmeshed in nail biting, high level spy trading negotiations. Mark Rylance as the Russian spy gave a memorable performance for which he deserved an Oscar. One felt such pathos surrounding this spy who in the end, whether he was convicted in America or sent back to his homeland in a spy trade, was in a no win situation. For the attorney played by Tom Hanks, he apparently became quite an asset in negotiating international deals for the Kennedy administration."

" If you love Cold War, this is your movie
",0.0772,-0.9626,2019-11-09 00:00:00,10,"Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I barley know about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance, proving once again how great actor he is."
" Coen brothers propaganda
",-0.25,-0.7314,2019-10-06 00:00:00,4,"The message is that the ""other"" is always a gift, and that Americans who resent those who seek to destroy their country are evil. No one in fact ever attacked Donovan's home, but it's a made up scene for the movie to reinforce how awful average Americans are, typical Coen brothers' nonsense. The push is always free of the fact that the Soviet system was and is vastly less concerned with civil liberties or rights than America. However, the movie frequently picks apart American values and slips these themes into the movie like roofies to lull the audience drinking in this bull. When Donovan tries to appeal and is warned off for the potential damage to his career, they forget this never happened, but the same film makers would never highlight how many mainstream Americans get de-platformed everyday from Facebook, Twitter and others in the greatest assault on the First Amendment in American history. Great acting, sets, cars and clothing, etc. Too bad there's a political anti-American theme dressed up as ""history""."

Also, because of all of the dead air and space that Spielberg left in the movie for 'effect' (like a clock ticking for 20 seconds to illustrate that Tom Hanks was bored... Thanks.) Oh, and it was also long from all of the interludes filled with terrible orchestral music. Music can make a film, and there were times where the music was as bad as the jokes.

" Two great actors deliver with a simple but superlative script
",0.3716,0.9418,2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Of course we know how great an actor Tom Hanks has been, with many Academy Award wins and nominations in his body of work. I think sometimes he makes it look so easy that he doesn't receive adequate credit for those roles. Sir Mark Rylance is more of a character actor, even though he has had lead roles also. He disappears into his characters. He was wonderful playing Thomas Cromwell in the tv series Wolf Hall. Boy, am I looking forward to the next series of that standout program. Oh, and by the way, he won the Academy Award for his work in this very film I am reviewing here. And of course it was directed by Steven Spielberg, a bit of a legend himself.The plot to Bridge of Spies is not as layered and complex as many spy thrillers, but if anything, not having twists and turns dropping onto our head from nowhere allows the suspense to build out in plain sight. Interestingly, one of the key scenes was filmed on location where the event actually took place. I am leaving out the details in case are you haven't watched it yet."
" A BRIDGE TO NOWHERE
",0.0,-0.7132,2019-04-22 00:00:00,6,"Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies is a Cold War drama set in the early 1960's. The movie is crowded with stories that all crash into each other. Sadly, they never generate any real drama. How could the man who made Jaws come to give us movies that have about as much drama as an election for President in Russia.The movie starts by showing us a guy painting a self portrait. Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance, recently of Wolf Hall fame). is a very unlikely spy, seemingly a simple man engrossed in his work as a painter. When he is arrested, James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance defense attorney, a 'common man' type who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and children, is picked by the Bar Association to represent the suspected Russian spy. Out of the blue so to speak, we are told the story of Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), the pilot of a US spy plan shot down while over the USSR. Powers is taken prisoner by the Soviets.Gee, I wonder how these dots are going to get connected?Donavan insists on giving Abel the best defense he can. In the process, he becomes as hated a figure as Abel. The trial judge, the newspapers, his friends and even his family, all try to convince him that he only has to go through the motions of representing Abel and no one expects him to get Abel acquitted because we all know he's guilty, right? Well, yes, we all do. The audience is shown from the start that Abel really is a spy so there is no suspense there. Abel's trial turns into a 'show trial' in spite of Donavan's efforts. Donavan's only success comes when he convinces the trial judge to sentence Abel to 30 years instead of the electric chair.And this is where the plot connects the Powers spy plane story - the CIA wants to exchange Abel for Powers. It asks Donavan to act as negotiator because the US government does not want to get involved directly in the negotiations. Donavan accepts and heads to Berlin.Now the movie could have just told us these stories and it would be a straight cold war drama - but no, its hero Donavan isn't going to just be a pawn for the CIA. So, enter a US student studying in Germany who is caught on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall on the day it is erected. It seems he is trying to save a girl he is in love with, or maybe it's just a friend - it doesn't matter because the student is just a plot device. He is arrested on charges of being a spy for a reason that will become clear.Donavan, after a series of cat and mouse games with various agents of the Soviets secures the deal to release Powers, but he will not agree to it unless the student is also released. The CIA goes nuts - it wants Powers and doesn't care about the student. Donavan won't budge - he is a decent American and we all know that decent Americans are far better than their duly elected ghastly government. Pont made. Story of stupid American student understood - he is there to be rescued.The screenplay was pieced together by more than one person - three or maybe two and a half - Joel and Ethan Coen were brought aboard to redo the original Matt Charman script. For this reason, the script is choppy and none of the characters is fully realized - except Donavan. What I hated about Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall was his stoical almost comatose attitude to everything that happened. In this movie, he is actually more deadpan, but his lack of concern about everything is used in the plot. On more than one tense occasion, Donavan asks his client if he is worried and Abel always answers, ""Would it help?"" It might help if Rylance moved an eyebrow once in awhile.The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and could have been brought in less than 2 hours. There are lots of Spielberg 'mood shots'. The music is like listening to crème puffs oozing out their goo then exploding at the 'dramatic' points - John Williams was ill (probably indigestion listening to his own scores after Jaws) so Thomas Newman filled in as pastry conductor. There are a lot of appearances by fine actors (Alan Alda among them) who are given about as many lines as Rylance has facial expressions.Keeping in character with Bridge of Spies, I am now going to do a flip and stitch in a new perspective - in spite of all the above, go see it. Tom Hanks is just so good at playing these kinds of roles that you shouldn't miss it. Not the showy stuff of Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, but the kind of roles that Henry Fonda gave us in 12 Angry Men and a host of other films. Another quietly fantastic Hanks' performance is worth the price of admission."
" A realistic and stressful drama!
",-0.5562,0.9943,2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"It is not that common a movie absorbs you with its story, but when it does, you could feel living inside it and experience it as it goes. Tom Hanks' acting is as good as ever and Mark Rylance's performance is absolutely incredible for which he won the academy Awards for best actor in a supporting role.
It's a movie about legal confidentiality in the years of the cold war, before Berlin's wall was broken. East Germany is highly under the Soviet union's influence, and a lawyer is responsible for trading lives between US, USSR and East Germany.
It's easy to watch as the rhythm of the movie never slows down more than a few seconds. Music is adequately good for the movie, Oscar Nominated.
I've never been a fan of Coen Brothers, and I've seen many of their originals. I liked their screenplay for this movie better than the others. Steven Spielberg's patriotism once again is dominating in this movie.
So, if you are one of those people who'd enjoy watching a movie based on a true story, full of dialogues, monologues, great acting, good music, and a lot of nervousness, this is your type of movie. I deducted a few points for I'd never watch this movie again, didn't love the directing, and I think there were unnecessary exaggeration in some scenes.
However, I loved that you'll know about the situation and what is going on in many scenes just as the protagonist knows and understands: if he's waiting, you're waiting, if he's scared, you're scared, and if he's nervous about what is going to happen, you'd feel the same. The amount of empathy you'd feel for this movie's characters is very much in many scenes. Other scenes, on the contrary, somehow hard to feel any empathy.All in all, watch this movie, there's a reason it's been nominated for many awards, and as much as Spielberg's involvement, the quality of production is never below a certain point which makes it, still, a good movie to enjoy and a good story to listen to."

" An Intense, Powerful, Captivating Spy Thriller
",0.5423,0.9776,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year."
" Not historically accurate
",0.0,0.9827,2018-12-25 00:00:00,4,"No mention of Donovan being a spy himself. Half of the movie we listen lots of speeches about democracy values and justice as an explanation of Abel's great luck of staying alive. Meanwhile, if you compare the final sentences - 30 years for Abel and 10 for Powers - you'd be a bit confused. If you ever notice that of course, because Soviet court scene is shown quite brief, loud and weird. I haven't even heard what judge had said there first time I watched the scene.
They switched the way how Abel and Powers were treated as prisoners (Abel wrote that he was hit once, while Powers mentioned he stayed in a comfy cell and was treated well)
East Germany was shown as it was straight after Berlin surrender in 1945 (gloomy, with tanks, army, dirt, 100% bombed buildings + blue colour filter). It looked much better in 60s, just google it. Look at the pictures of Elvis visit for example. Soviets put loads of money there (as well as USA - to West Germany) to keep up with the race, it was their ""shopfront"" back then. And of course it could not be bloody snowing there in summer!
Abel was considered a hero after the exchange and officially was praised as a great spy. (They lied about it in the final afterstory credits)I think if you take real events as a base for your movie, it's not fair to twist all the details like this. Even if you're dying to show countries and events stereotypically, please check the sources first, your movie only wins after that."

I don't know how historically correct this movie is, but this movie might spread the wrong idea. Just because they are Russians it doesn't mean that they are bad people. I wish this movie was taken with both their perspective in mind and presented in such a way that the audience so that we can better understand the situation on both sides.

As a daughter of parents who lived through Communism Eastern Europe in the fifties, they immigrated to the United States. The Germany especially the East Berlin side was grim and bleak under communism. This film did a terrific job in relating and bringing the story to life about James Donovan, a lawyer who defended Abel under enormous pressure. His family endured bullying and taunting from friends, neighbors and colleagues. Tom Hanks was perfect in the role by the way. Alan Alda also played a supporting role. Again the film really belonged to Sir Mark Rylance who was also awarded Knighthood for his services as an actor. I could watch him in anything."
" Mostly Okay But a Superb Finale
",0.7964,0.9432,2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story: In 1957, James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) is a partner in a Brooklyn law firm who deals mostly in insurance claims. After he is assigned to defend a convicted Soviet spy, his life and mission are changed entirely.Director Steven Spielberg succeeds in evoking earlier periods: Brooklyn in 1957 and Berlin in 1962. The physical atmosphere has a mood of its own in each city. These evocations are well aided by the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.The beginning is rather good but is occasionally predictable even to those of us not aware of the historical events. Donovan also seems too earnest and we don't fully get why he would be this way considering the danger his convictions place upon him and his family.The middle of the film successfully portrays the bleakness of Berlin as the infamous wall is being built; but it tends to sag and seem overlong.The final scene, which takes place in the titular location, lifts everything to make the film worthwhile. The bleak winter night is made even harsher as the tension and suspense reach their heights. Here, Spielberg shows once again what makes him great.There may be an overall message: that countries with good laws must maintain those good laws to stay great, even when such countries are being threatened. This principle could still be a source of today's discussions about similar situations.."

""Inspired by true events"", I'm confident there were artistic liberties and shortcuts taken in order to tell the tale, but I'm sure other reviews have parsed the details. What I appreciated was the gripping and suspenseful storytelling, and when I realized after the fact that Spielberg was the director, I wasn't surprised. I'm not a Tom Hanks fan at all, but I can say he knocks it out of the park with this one. Everything felt genuine and period correct. The film is thoughtful and makes you think about some higher themes, while making you want to concentrate on what is happening so that you don't miss anything. It covers a lot of ground, and it probably helped that I didn't really know much about the events in question. The dialogue is witty and on point (see, Hollywood, you can still do it when you want to), and some scenes are quite moving. This movie is proof that you don't need sado-masochistic torture scenes and embarrassing soft porn to have a gripping spy movie.

The story buildup is done very well and both characters depicted by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance make you appreciate more the human side of the story rather than the political one. Even given the serious tone of the story, I did enjoy the humorous elements that were added in by the characters to lighten the mood.Don't expect too much action and suspense as this is not that type of movie, rather focus on the points this movie is trying to present about the ideals that we agree with but often don't follow. In this case Tom Hanks' character is fighting for what's right, not what's politically favorable.The movie has a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" to it, that's why I gave it 9 instead of 8 and it's well deserved."

I will avoid the plot spoiler details, but we know historically he would go on to negotiate the spy exchange for downed pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell).As a history buff I found the details (even if they may have been inaccurate) interesting as they weaved a tale demonstrating the ability of an insurance lawyer to negotiate.

Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar.After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel.The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects. But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film.Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks."

" A hit from Spielberg
",0.0,0.983,2018-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end."
" Really well made Cold War true story
",0.0754,0.9954,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his ""would it help?""s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time."

Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, who has directed and produced many war-time films (such as Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Schindler's List) he sets this film during the bleak conditions of the Cold War, just as the Berlin War completes construction.Bridge of Spies employs fantastic acting from all cast members, especially Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, who emit a strong yet realistic sense of camaraderie and friendship due to their, at first, mutual relationship which develops into a bond so tight that the audience doesn't want it to be broken. The film also manages to contrast image and words, which work brilliantly, such as every scene where Tom Hanks is on a train, where no words are spoken, but one hundred ideas are broadcasted via the strong emotional face of Tom Hanks. These Grade-A performances as well as the completely differing settings of the two halves of the film, perfectly execute the mood integral for this serious, often heart-tugging moments. As mentioned, the scenery is gorgeous, with frequent switches of location; from America to Berlin and back, the location/cinematography greatly enhances the atmosphere of this film as do the uncoverings of background characters emotions and feelings towards Hanks' character such as a random policeman he meets, all questioning him: ""Why are you defending that traitor?"", revealing to the audience the side some must take for their country.Overall, the film is magnificent with perfect performances, a contrasting climate (from sun to snow) and the nuanced characters makes Bridge of Spies a fantastic film with strong underlying morals and values which still apply to this day."

However, I believe that the logistics of the exchange were oversimplified, and did not pose to be an accurate depiction of the heated arguments that must have been at play during that time. In addition, certain imagery was very effective in drawing comparative environments between the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the scene in Berlin when James Donovan is viewing the men that attempted to climb over the Berlin wall. This scene was compared to the end scene in which we were exposed to children in the United States climbing over a fence without the slightest nervousness of violence. Overall, this movie was a great docudrama that inspired to support the strength and conviction of the United States' pride in a free trial."

It gets quite tense at times and I understood it better the second time I viewed it. I gave it a 10.

" Good film of Cold War true events
",0.2023,-0.9981,2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"""Bridge of Spies"" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history. The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men. All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects. Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957.The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel. The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971.Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial.In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park. James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor. While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970. A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in ""Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident."" A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain,"" stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War."

I have to also in the same breath mention the absolutely fantastic Oscar winning performance given by Mark Rylance. Mark gives an epic performance in his own right and it's so fine to see their two characters on screen. Bridge of Spies is as close to flawless as movies of this type get. It tells the story as it should but I appreciate the way it's told, it makes it more interesting, how the story is weaved. It makes all the difference how you spin a tale and in the same turn, hook the movie watcher in. Bridge of Spies finds just the right balance, striking just the right chord in my book!"

Before I tell you what I think I just want to say that despite my perceptions, I still think the movie was a decent movie. The acting, cinematography, directing, and script were all superb, and I cannot say enough about Tom Hanks, he truly is one of the best actors in Hollywood. All that aside, the movie was boring. While the acting and directing were well done, there was nothing interesting about what was happening. Just another spy movie - without the action - with a pretty predictable ending. There was no action, no twists, no interesting commentary or argumentative dialogue surrounding the particular political atmosphere at the time. Just a pretty straight forward storyline with nothing to capture, or retain, interest (in terms of the storyline). With that in mind, I don't want to say it was a bad movie because it wasn't. I suppose I just expected more. With that in mind, I would still recommend the movie, so long as one isn't expecting any fireworks...and has had plenty of coffee in advance."

He is so laid back as to be almost horizontal. It is, by its subject, a very talky movie but it is well written and none of the talk is wasted time. It is absorbing and interesting about a time when I had little interest in world politics. It all makes sense to me now."
" ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical films
",0.0,0.9973,2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"When the director of ""Jaws,"" the star of ""Forrest Gump"" and the writers of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" come together to make a film, you know you're in for a treat.""Bridge of Spies"" is set in 1957 during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked by his partners to defend Abel in the impending trial. Donovan is ridiculed and scorned by his fellow Americans for representing and defending Abel, as many of them would rather see him hanging from a rope. However, Donovan's success in keeping Abel away from the death penalty proves vital in negotiating with the Soviets after they capture an American spy. Whenever I watch Tom Hanks, seldom do I see Tom Hanks. Whether it's Forrest Gump, Captain John H. Miller or Woody from ""Toy Story,"" Hanks consistently excels at becoming the characters he portrays, and he delivers a dynamic performance as James Donovan. The character is decent and kind, but firm in upholding the law and his personal values. Mark Rylance's portrayal of Rudolf Abel is Oscar-worthy. Abel is an awkward, mild-mannered and unusually calm elderly man, the last person you would suspect as a Soviet spy. In the face of potential execution following a guilty verdict, Abel remains cool and collected. Blown away by his lack of alarm or concern, Donovan questions, ""Are you not worried?"" to which Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" Ethan and Joel Coen's script dishes out the perfect comedic, dramatic and thrilling elements that make ""Bridge of Spies"" great. Its dialogue drives the story, and while this may turn off certain audiences, I found it enthralling. Fundamental themes of integrity, perseverance and standing up for what's right are broadcast clearly and effectively through the actions and words of the story's protagonists. Like most of his films, Steven Spielberg's touch is evident from the first shot. There are several scenes throughout the film in which two or more people are simply exchanging dialogue in a room. While on paper this may come across as dull, Spielberg keeps you engaged by positioning his characters in different places during a scene. Through this he is able to portray a variety of shot types and angles and simulate the effect of cuts that aren't actually there.Spielberg's narrative direction is as captivating as his visual storytelling. ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on a true story, and very little is altered or fabricated for the sake of entertainment. Aside from a few minor plot points and inconsistencies of the spies' time in captivity, Spielberg and the Coen brothers stay true to the intriguing story of how an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn saved the lives of two Americans and a Soviet spy.Novelty in today's cinema is a hallowed treasure. Unique scripts are replaced with unnecessary sequels and reboots, and dialogue-driven stories dwell in the shadow of the next Marvel blockbuster. Despite Hollywood's ever-growing lack of originality, directors like Spielberg continually restore my faith in filmmaking. ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical thrillers, and is a must-see for lovers of the genre."

What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier.With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was.With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon.***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed ""Good Guys of the Free World"" in a bad light."

" A gripping cold war thriller
",-0.5423,0.9769,2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Set at the height of the cold war Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is arrested in New York; nobody is keen to represent him in court but eventually James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer with previous experience at the Nuremberg trials, takes on the job. He is not expected to do much more than go through the motions but he is determined that Abel will represented to the best of his ability even if that makes him unpopular. Donovan is adamant that Abel must be given the best defence as demanded by the US Constitution not doing so would make America little better than countries that don't have fair trials. Somewhat inevitably Abel is found guilty but Donovan makes a very logical plea against the expected death sentence if for no other reason he should be kept alive so that the United States will have somebody to trade if one of their spies is caught by the Soviets. Not long afterwards just such an event happens when US pilot Gary Powers is shot down while flying a U2 spy plane high over the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards another American is arrested on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain; this time a student in East Berlin. Donovan soon finds himself in Berlin, where he is to negotiate with the Soviets to exchange Abel for Powers however he wants both Powers and the student; it won't be easy though as the latter is held by the East Germans and the CIA aren't at all bothered about getting him back; they just want Powers before he cracks and starts to spill secrets about the U2 project.This is very much a film of two halves; both of them gripping. The first half is a court room drama where Donovan represents Abel to the best of his abilities even though it makes him very unpopular with a population that seems to think that anybody who represents a suspected spy is little better themselves; during this we also get scenes showing Powers entering the U2 programme and explanations of his mission before his eventual shooting down. These scenes serve to introduce the main characters and their situations but are still gripping in their own right. Tension raises significantly once the action moves to Berlin as it is made clear that if anything goes wrong while Donovan is in East Berlin he doesn't have any formal protection. There is a sense of anti-communist paranoia in America but this is nothing compared to the tension in East Berlin were people are being shot trying to cross the newly erected Berlin Wall. Tom Hanks does a great job as Donovan; an apparently ordinary man who has found himself in an extraordinary situation. Mark Rylance also stands out as Abel; a likable character with a dry sense of humour. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story gripping and capturing the feel of the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film."
" Explaining The Cold War Era
",-0.5994,-0.9203,2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema. That's exactly what happens (again) with ""Bridge of Spies"". It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.For a basic plot summary, ""Bridge of Spies"" tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union. Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.The area in which ""Bridge of Spies"" works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable. The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11. Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of ""patriotic justice"". Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions. At school, they are taught to ""duck and cover"" in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the ""Commie traitor"".Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role. Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", or the typical Jimmy Stewart ""defend peace and law at all costs"" type role. In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.The only reason ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't even better is that the ""espionage stuff"" over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film. The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level. It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy. Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of ""Bridge of Spies"", as well as the notable acting performances given. It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across. That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its ""fair shake"" in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses."
" Why did I wait so long for this movie?
",0.0,0.9668,2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Bridge of Spies. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. It is so amazing. Stick around and see how so.Synopsis: In the cold war, a lawyer, James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers. The pilot was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission and stays in the company of a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US. Starring: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance Director: Steven SpielbergFirst thing is, there is hardly anything wrong with this movie. The only downfall is the fact that it ran two minutes longer than it should have. Just a mere two minutes was the matter of this movie being a 10 or a 9. Throughout Tom Hanks' character's whole time in Germany he was saying all he wanted to do was get home to his bed. When that happened at the end of the movie it should have just ended there. There was no need to show that people respected his character after he got back. Falling onto his bed and going to sleep was enough in my opinion.Now that we got the one bad thing out of the way, let's talk about the best thing of the movie. Mark Rylance did deserve the best supporting actor for his role. He was so amazing in this movie. Was he a spy or not? Yes, the truth has come out and he was a spy, but nobody knew that at the time. The way Rylance played it off as if you couldn't tell was superb. If he see this movie for anything watch it for Rylance's performance.Tom Hanks in this movie was as amazing as he always is. Well, after he stopped doing those romance movies. And outside the two I have mentioned, there was no one who stood out. That's okay. The whole situation was about how Donovan treated Abel respectfully and worked over the Russians and Germans to get what the U.S. needed.Unlike a lot of Spielberg's movies in the last twenty years this one did not have a pacing problem. Even though it was nearly two and a half hours long it didn't feel that way. You are so entranced in the story that you don't realize you were sitting there for two hours and then the movie is over.How this movie didn't win more awards is beyond me. It was so good. This is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. I guarantee it. Watch it.Rating: 9 out of 10"
" A potentially excellent movie let down by the director
",0.5719,0.9776,2017-02-24 00:00:00,3,"At the end of the movie (2 hours) I was left feeling hugely disappointed. Most of the concerns that I had during the movie were left unanswered and, once again, Spielberg's inability to omit moments of crass emotion or signpost future scenes (watch out for thugs on the streets etc.) were galling. The cast should be excellent but only Tom Hank's character seems to benefit from any real development. Even then I wanted to give him a damned good shake; talk with your wife for Pete's sake, why would your colleagues put you into this position, don't walk so close to the wall, your family has just been shot at!All of the opportunities to develop the sub plots are ham-fisted, bordering on stereotyping. But then that is what Spielberg usually gives you. In a movie this long the pieces should feel like they are supporting the whole but they feel oddly disjointed.The final scenes do give a good reflection of the paranoia of those days (to which we seem to be returning). But at the end I was left asking ""is that it?""In conclusion, Bridge of Spies is a watchable movie with excellent period feel which is enjoyable as long as you watch it rather than think about it."
" Bridge of Spies
",0.0,0.1496,2017-02-23 00:00:00,2,"The film ""Bridge of Spies"" set during the cold war is a collection of banalities including a predictable plot, mediocre acting and dull music. The screenplay could have been much more thrilling if the writers would have followed the main events in a more historically accurate way.The real life of James B. Donovan was much more exciting than the one depicted in the film. He was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and was already a well-known lawyer when he took the Rudolf Abel case. Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; the shootings, which were the most similar to the ones depicted were those associated with the killing of Peter Fechter that happened the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge.The real life stories of the spies of that period offer rich material for a writer, however the Coen brothers took the most uninteresting segment of the espionage story. The characters are bland and forgettable. This is an example of a politically correct propaganda film showing the good work of the intelligence services.The film ""Bridge of Spies"" is boring and disappointing – a naïve film made for a naïve audience. It is clear that Spielberg is a populist and the master of banality.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2016/09/bridge-of-spies-review/"
" Fantastic Movie
",0.5574,0.965,2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"Tom Hanks does it again with a very well thought out, fast paced and emotionally moving story. I was eager to see this film and it truly didn't disappoint. While it is based on true events, I found myself focusing on the Constitution for which this film draws attention to. I appreciate very much how the focus is on an attorney willing to uphold the rights of an individual, while possibly being a spy for the USSR. Loved this film and highly recommend it."
" Well done
",0.2732,0.9888,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, well-produced. Spielberg and the Coen brothers take an interesting episode in world history and craft a compelling, dramatic story. About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)"
" Solid historical drama
",0.1531,0.9955,2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama. While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie."
" Getting across the wall
",0.0,0.9799,2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap."
" OK story, but too long and too slow
",0.2421,-0.5457,2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"This is a movie about spies during the cold war. Main problem was the movie was well over 2 hours with not enough excitement or tension. Plot is Rudolf Abel is arrested for being a Russian spy, I guess he was but never really admits it. Tom Hanks plays James his lawyer. When an US pilot gets captured by the Russians, James makes a play to trade Rudolf for him. He does the dangerous work of even going to Berlin and meeting with Russian and German officials. He learns of a US student whom has been arrested in Berlin, so going against what he's told, he tries to bargain for the student also.So of course the 2 sides have issues, but in the end James is able to negotiate the release of both US detainees. FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but only watch it if you got a lot of time on your hands."
" ***1/2
",0.0,0.9753,2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Someone will have to explain to me why Mark Rylance won the best supporting Oscar award for this very good film, especially in a year where Sylvester Stallone was well favored to garner the award.That being said, this was a very good film showing the efforts of a Brooklyn lawyer in going to Europe to secure the swap of Rudolph Ivanovich Abel, a Russian spy with Gary Francis Powers, the latter getting caught during the U-2 Spy Incident during the waning years of the Eisenhower administration.Hanks, as the attorney, is relentless that the swap must include the economics student who was studying in East Germany at the wrong time. The film showed the break that there was between East Germany and the Soviet Union."
" Good Entertainment if You Don't Need Historical Accuracy or Reality
",0.6908,-0.94,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"We enjoyed this movie on a purely entertainment level. If you don't have to have historical accuracy and logic, this will do for that.The movie is filled with mucho movie clichés, for example, a dark stormy, rainy night to set the anxious scene for the shady CIA agent following Tom Hanks, cold blizzardy snow to set the East Germany post war gloom and danger, mean/cold/evil CIA agents, a judge that doesn't care about following proper legal proceedings, WW II era German soldiers, cold and calculating Soviets, 1950's innocence in America, Commie hating Americans, unquestioning allegiance to the Military, and of course everything has to be based on a time deadline and come down to a happy ending at the last moment.The first part of the movie made me uncomfortable because of its historical inaccuracy and exaggerations. Once I stopped looking for accuracy and reality as necessities, I settled down to just being entertained. Gary Powers clinging to his spinning out of control U-2 was both exciting and silly. A person attached to an out of control airplane that was falling at +400 mph would be torn apart. I believe the historically accurate story was less exciting. Gary Powers ejected after his plane was hit, failed to destroy the aircraft and take his suicide pill, and was captured, to the embarrassment of the U.S.The movie takes a long time to move through the story that we know has to have a happy ending. It's filled with almost there, then failure, then almost there again. That's the main pattern of the telling.Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, no matter who he plays these days. He's no longer the intense actor we saw in ""Big"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Cast Away"", or his other blockbuster masterpieces. The overall theme of the story was a good one. Spying was considered a necessary part of the Cold War, and both sides denying that they were spying was part of the game.History loses something in the telling."
" Top notch film; highly recommended
",0.4391,0.9347,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"*I Will Do My Best to not include spoilers but if I feel the need I will notify you beforehandOverall: This movie is a great cold war drama and is another badge that Spielberg and Hanks should wear with pride.Good: Absolutely stunning cinematography. Every single actor did their job incredibly well and could not be flawed.The story itself is very interesting and I imagine it was a very tough task to transform it into a movie but it worked so well done writers. Anyone can turn a large scale event such as Dunkirk, or Stalingrad but to turn something much more minor and make it give an effect ranking with them events requires true skill. ​Beautiful music to show tension, heart warming moments and even the brutality such as the train sequence, speaking of which was jaw dropping. The ending was so very well done and came full circle to the movies prior events though I feel the actual final negotiations could have been done a little better. ​Bad: The first act is quite slow and dull but it makes up for it after that. Some scenes could be taken away or cut down. Some subplots and minor characters such as the journalist, while possibly historically accurate, felt out of place and could have meant more if explored more thoroughly. The final negotiations could have been done a tad bit better and accents weren't always accurate.Best Part: The ending that comes full circleMVP: Ton Hanks as James Donovan9/10"
" Good Spielburg Drama
",0.4404,0.9963,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I thought Bridge of Spies was a well made period drama. I really enjoy that Spielburg takes efforts to make you feel like you are in the fifties in this one. The cars, the style, and even the authentic train Hanks rode to work made it excellent. I enjoy period pieces, they are more engrossing when the environment around the actors seems to match the era they are supposed to be in. The little touches were great.I found, like another reviewer, this movie to be more humorous than I expected as well. I really liked Abel's repeated ""Would it help?"" to comedic effect. This was a well written drama by the Coen brothers as well. The combination of the Coen's writing with Spielburg's vision was great. Tom Hanks is fantastic in this movie as he usually is. I am a big fan of Tom Hanks, he has always been very versatile. Here he plays a lawyer tapped to defend a suspected Russian spy in court, and negotiate the return of captured Americans in exchange for the spy. Hanks does well with these types of roles. There isn't a lot of action in this movie, but there is still an excellent Spielburgian action sequence. The movie moves along fairly quickly for such a long movie, and that is no small feat, as some of the material is pretty dry. This movie could have been much more boring than it was, the story was told well. I am a huge Spielburg fan, like many movie fans, and he does a great job again. The cinematography from Spielburg's regular team was excellent.Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I am not generally a fan of spy movies. I find spy movies boring sometimes, even ones with great action sequences. This movie is a well made period drama, that should satisfy fans of the Coen brothers, Tom Hanks, and Steven Speilburg. Check it out if you like biographical period dramas. 8/10"
