" A really good movie with a great plot & good photography.
",0.8882,0.9132,2021-03-30 00:00:00,8,"A really good movie with a great plot & good photography. In this age of cyberspace, everything is hackable and manipulatable. That what this movie is all about. In the real world the more we rely on very complex computer devices, the easier it is to have hackers breach security systems. This is a fictional film based on today's reality. It does have some twists and turns that might leave some guessing so some may need to watch it twice. On the downside, it is too short. Back out the beginning garbage, the end credits, half of the case scene, and it is only a smidgen over an hour long. It is too short to develop the interpersonal relationships, some of the scenes, and the end disposition. Brief synopsis: Willis is a veteran and highly capable field operative who uses a 'black box' hacking device that can hack anything, anywhere, to bring out who sold his cover & who killed his wife and almost his son. His son, Lutz, puts on the best performance in the movie as he tries to stop the device from falling into the wrong hands eventually finds his dad and they team up."
" SMH!
",-0.3802,0.3745,2021-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Don't let the names Bruce Willis and Gina Carano fool you, not even good actors can make a poorly written film decent! If you want to just throw something on while you look at videos on youtube then this is it! You may hear a gunshot or something and glance up here and there but trust me don't bother in attempting to get into this mess!"
" A bit of a mess...
",0.0,0.9431,2021-03-15 00:00:00,4,"For the most part, this is a straight-to-video action movie that is 'okay' at best. The plot was the usual confused mix of clichés that never really make for a particularly exciting movie, but things are never awful, either (well, before the finale). Bruce Willis could have filmed his scenes in a couple of days, but when you have a big-name actor in a small part, at least make good use of them... In this, it feels like he's sleepwalking his way through a few scenes in a warehouse and just hoping to pay off his latest car or something similar.Oddly enough, the film is so forgettable that I was near the end before I realised I had watched it once before (admittedly, in the background whilst doing something else). The only memory I had was in thinking that the female lead made a nice change from the usual. She actually looked like she could kick posterior, but was poorly used.Since then, I have become a bit of a Gina Carano fan and, in now knowing some of her background, you can't help but wonder what the director and writers were thinking, when they could've put her skills to great use.The worst part of the film, however, is the conclusion. It really is a confused mess, with the obligatory saw-it-coming double-crosses, but also badly edited and pieced together. It's as though the director gave up, never finished filming, and the editor/s had to somehow cobble something together with the footage that was left.Essentially... if you want something disposable in the background, you could do worse. That's about the best you can say."
" It's hollow, but nothing awful
",0.4973,0.8797,2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,"I didn't find 'Extraction' to be that bad at all, it's not good either but it's definitely nothing terrible. I found it an OK, relatively well paced full on action film.It is, I will say, one of those productions that big up a well known actor, in this case Bruce Willis, yet they actually don't even feature much. That's a negative for sure, like why would you have Willis and not make him the main attraction - most likely down to financial/scheduling issues, but still.Kellan Lutz is very much the lead in this and I think he does a solid enough job, as does 'Fast & Furious' alum Gina Carano. Talking of alumni, 'The Walking Dead' duo Steve Coulter and Joshua Mikel appear.I agree the story is nothing exciting or thrilling, but I honestly didn't have much of problem whilst watching it. It's hollow, but nothing awful - in my opinion, anyway.If you're looking for a good action film with this title, check out the 2020 release with Chris Hemsworth - it's certainly much better."
" Skip this one
",0.0,-0.8343,2021-01-24 00:00:00,3,"Weird plot lines, really bad acting - even Willis is not at his best. I'd skip it if I had it to do over."
" Mediocre plot, contrived cheesy dialogue. The action is okay.
",0.2263,-0.9914,2020-12-04 00:00:00,4,"An action movie doesn't need to be high quality, but this one falls just a little short of even that standard. The plot is forced, people being idiots and doing things because the plot requires it with no regard for whether anybody would actually do such a thing.
The dialogue is bland, cliché, and often badly delivered (because the lines are so bad nobody could mouth those words with any conviction.)
Some plot devices are shoehorned in for convenience but then never go anywhere.
It has some okay action, as expected from an action movie, but it could have used a little more. And of course it uses the standard movie cheat codes - bad guys get knocked unconscious by hitting them in the stomach, but the good guy takes a minute-long beating to the face by multiple trained fighters and walks away without a bruise (after rendering them all unconscious with a few unconvincing hits.)
The big fight scene at the end involves three different factions, at least, and it's dark and muddled as many fight scenes are, and the motivations of some of the characters are not clear, which makes it impossible to really follow what's going on.
And finally, if someone is chasing you and you don't see them behind you any more, don't stop and look around for them. Keep going, idiot.
Still gets four stars because it's supposed to be a mindless action movie, so it's not a high standard. But it's like they didn't even try."
" Complete yawnfest

",0.0,0.9926,2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend.I love any chance I get to see Gina Carano in action, but Kellan Lutz carries the majority of the movie with Bruce Willis and Carano in more of a support capacity.For an action movie, it's pretty good, the problem is that it is a spy movie. It's all about intel, it's focused on the CIA, but for some reason we keep presenting the CIA as a private army instead of a foreign based intelligence agency (like an overseas FBI, but without guns). Even ""assets"", like assassins, are technically outsourced and aren't supposed to be available in country.The motivation of an ""all hack"" device isn't quite enough for me, and the action is mediocre compared to most action films, but very well done.The most interesting parts of the movie are the ""spoiler"" bits, so there is something extra to what I see as a very bland main plot, but all in all it's a very average, if good, movie experience."

" Awful
",-0.4588,-0.9455,2020-08-14 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I have seen. Especially with any kind of budget. Absolutely nothing works. Well maybe the camerawork is passable. Terrible acting, bad plot and possibly worst music ever in any movie. Do not waste your time even if you are Bruce Willis fan, he is only few minutes in the movie and is equally awful than all the other actors."
" This Genre Is Played
",0.34,-0.9242,2020-08-07 00:00:00,1,"This is another one of those movies about one highly trained super spy who can beat up 15 armed men with nothing but a poo noodle. The guy is usually a rebel who does things his way while getting criticized by his superiors. Oh, and he's also a ladies' man who has trouble making a commitment. It's so played. We've seen it so many times. You know how it's going to end.Usually the success of most movies is going to be determined by whether the characters are likable, and that is where this movie falls short. This guy is annoying. There was one scene where he was threatening to kill some guy unless he revealed the location of the bad guy. We both want something. I want to know where the bad guys are, and you want to live. I turned it off after than scene."
" Opposite of Original
",0.3182,-0.7269,2020-07-24 00:00:00,2,"Waste of everyone's time. Willis makes fair use of his few minutes of screen time and Gina Carano is always fun to watch. Joshua Mikel is a believable bad guy and turns in an above average performance that stands out in this film. Other than this, the plot line, acting, and staging is a painful experience. I wonder if the writers, director, and cast are as embarrassed as I am for them."

It had a lot of flaws too - some questionable acting, poor photography (who on this film is in love with gaudy green color casts?) and some lazy writing. but the action was good and overlooking the lazy writing the story was good. Definitely better than the ratings to date."
" Great movie

You simply tried to duplicate that formula, and failed miserably. Look, you tried. There was a good story there, but you didn't dig deep enough. You even used similar lenses, stages and script. A giant rip off. You got 3 stars from me, because I love the four actors I just mentioned.What I think sucks, is that actors have to pay for your mistakes. Poor writing, poor production, and yet it's the actor that takes the hit. Shame. ""Dishonor on you. Dishonor on your cow.""Gina, Bruce, Kellan and Sweeney.... great job guys. Professional as always.I'm a terrible writer, it's true. So take it from me. Don't copycat... it never works. You always pay in the end."

",-0.4767,-0.6462,2020-07-09 00:00:00,3,"I caught this on Netflix. I had higher hopes, but this movie just didn't make the cut. The action scenes were ok with the fight sequences well choreographed. However, in general the acting was poor. Even Bruce Willis's performance was lacking.

" Total and Complete Crap
",-0.3818,0.9845,2020-07-05 00:00:00,1,"Oh my God. It pains me so to see ol' Bruce having any part in these low production eye-vomit movies. He must have lost all his early Hollywood money somehow and is now forced to take on these laughable and terrible productions. Good lord, Bruce is just calling-it-in when it comes to his acting and delivery of his lines. He must have so much contempt for what movie making is nowadays. Bruce plays second-fiddle to a much younger, bulked-up, male model, meathead of an actor named Kellan Lutz. Kellan has an impressive acting resume but you wouldn't know it watching this movie. So perhaps he is in the same position as ol' Bruce. The director of this movie must have been in love with this young actor/model (Kellan) because just like the opening credits, there are massive wastes of time, self-indulgent, montage scenes and fight scenes. They to convince you that Kellan is some kinda bad-ass, Chris Hemsworth looking (it's ironic as Chris Hemsworth delivered an amazing performance both acting and bad-ass fight scenes in a 2020 Netflix debut movie of the exact same name ""Extraction"". HA!) So let whoever is in charge of modern day Hollywood know what type of disgraceful job they're doing today and how they ruined one of the few things the rest of world use to love about America which is great movie making and pop culture. Oh well, at least Quentin Tarantino is still producing and directing movies. We still got a little of Spielberg left and his protege (in a manner of speaker) JJ Abrams. Alas, they are not prolific enough to save us from watching modern movies like this dog-leg of a film."

A guy said he would suck his dad's ****. Seriously.I'm guessing the rest of the movie was contingent upon us believing Bruce Willis was a super agent that no one had been able to keep up with...until his son (Kellan Lutz) finally proved his mettle. I bet he saved his dad even.Plus they gave Dan Bilzerian a speaking role. The guy is the man, ok, but he's like a good looking and competent Tommy Wiseau. Keep him at the after party, give him a voice role in Zootopia 2 as an evil leopard, just don't cast him as the guy who sits in the dark by the computer saying smart things. I turned it off after that scene. I was filled with dread at the prospect of having to hear Dan say something like ""we've zeroed in on the signal, they're on the move""."
" Thinking hard for good things to say...
",0.3612,0.9473,2020-05-29 00:00:00,3,"From the very first scene, it's obvious this movie will not be what you hoped. I love a pulpy action thriller, but this lost me inside the first minute. The first sequence, though intended to be grim and heavy, was unintentionally hilarious...I laughed twice and neither time was at a joke.The writing is abysmal. There is no other word for it. Full of cliches and plot holes large enough in which to lose Bruce Willis' (presumably) enormous pack packet.
I'm a big Willis fan, but it's like he's totally checked out. Kellan Lutz and Gina Carano do a good enough job, but they can only ever be as good as the team around them, and some of the background acting is truly atrocious.From the world's longest training montage, to the laughably unnecessary CGI, this film assaults you from all angles.I want to end on a positive note, so I will. The action scenes and ocassional glimpse of Bruce Willis...kinda just being Bruce Willis...are the best parts of this movie; it's just too bad they are sandwiched between the rest of it."

",-0.4939,0.9771,2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"It's a decent action-er, really like Kellan Lutz, Gina Carano in their roles. D.B.Sweeney is always reliable, and he's good here too. Kinda liked Dan Bilzarian and really liked Joshua Mikel. Kellan Lutz has turned up as a regular in FBI: Most Wanted, though not getting a whole lot to do, it's nice to see him again, after enjoying his performance in this movie. Bruce Willis was the icing on the cake, though he's not in the film a lot, he lends his acting experience and the weight of his reputation. The only thing I really, really didn't like was the music. I don't want to trash it, because composing and performing is a skill, too. Maybe it just wasn't right in this particular movie - it smacked of 'B' movie, to me. A proper score from real instruments, not a digital one, would have been a very good thing. Oh well, anyhow, liked the movie, lots of fast-paced action, decent plot, decent acting generally, and fine acting in a couple of cases."

After that, it's like a badly tuned white noise and then a droll muffle of an AM radio.Nothing makes sense in this movie. I follow the suspension of disbelief code when watching movies but it seems white impossible for this.

Apparently he shot all his scenes in one day and it shows. It looks like they didn't pay him enough for more than one facial expression ('serious') and I hate to say it but this reminds me of many recent Steven Segal, outings, specifically the execrable 'Sniper: Spec Ops', i.e. the great man shares little or no screen time with other actors so they can easily add him into scenes during editing. How sad.It's not that this is a by-the-numbers action flick which adds nothing to the genre, it's that it's so boring. The actors are going through the motions. The dialogue is tedious, the characters uninteresting. The colour grading is 'edgy' and exaggerated much like the title sequence (which really put me off from the start). I imagine the inexperienced cast members were excited to appear in a Bruce Willis movie but it's hard to see how this will help their careers.Ultimately it's the kind of movie you fast forward through primarily to avoid the pain of seeing it in your 'continue watching' queue on Netflix."

" Family vengeance
",0.0,-0.9297,2018-10-25 00:00:00,2,"Saw 'Extraction' because Bruce Willis has done good films and given good performances in the past, 'Die Hard' is a genre landmark and his performance is iconic in that. The title and poster also intrigued. Have an appreciation for action and the idea for the story sounded interesting. Expectations were not high though, because Willis has been past prime for a while (several bad films and has looked tired and disengaged a lot).'Extraction' is not a good representation of him, if not as bad as 'Vice' and especially 'Reprisal'. 'Extraction' is a better film to that while having similar, actually even the same, faults. It fails in the action stakes, faring very unfavourably in relation to other films seen in the genre, and while anything involving abductions and rescues have been very engagingly done on film 'Extraction' manages to portray it with no thrills complete with dull pacing, lots of silliness and endless predictability. Not hating it with pleasure, it's my honest opinion and my negative feelings towards it are regrettable.Not much redeemable here, but two performers do try and come off reasonably well compared to everything else.One is charming Gina Carano, the best thing about the film, although she is very underused. The other is DB Sweeney, giving his all with conscientiousness without overdoing.However, for someone highly billed, Willis is used poorly, being hardly in it for someone so misleadingly highly billed, he looks tired and like he didn't want to be there. Kellen Lutz shows no charisma or personality in the lead. Everybody else is bland and annoying.Visually, the film does lack cohesion and the colour scheme is so unappealingly murky. The music is too loud, should have been used far less and some of the placement is inappropriate. The direction is suggestive of inexperience, there is just no energy, momentum or finesse, the non-action oriented parts are handled so indifferently and the action is shot in a way that can be difficult to follow.Dialogue from the very start to the predictable climax is riddled with clichés and cheese and what little there is of the story has no surprises, fun or tension, is very pedestrian in pace and fails to make sense or have signs of maturity. Tension and suspense are non-existent. 'Extraction' goes overboard on the ridiculousness and lack of plausibility and at other points it takes itself too seriously. The action is clumsily choreographed, sloppily edited, near-incoherently shot and not exciting or suspenseful at all, as well as looking at least twenty years out of date and relying far too heavily on convenience. The characters are not compelling or easy to get behind, too sketchily written and with character behaviours and traits that frustrate. Do not expect every character in every film to be likeable when characters in numerous films purposefully aren't, but it is an issue if there are characters meant to be rootable and 'Extraction' has that problem.Concluding, very poor and close to shambolic. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

" Decent hand-to-hand fight sequences save low budget actions film (which Bruce Willis is barely in)
",-0.128,0.99,2018-06-04 00:00:00,4,"Bruce Willis got top billing in this film and is all over the film poster, but in classic low budget movie bait-and-switch, Willis filmed all his scenes in one day and is hardly in the film. The story involves Willis as a CIA operative who's kidnapped within the first few minutes of the film and it's then up to his son, Kellan Lutz, and real-life MMA champion Gina Carano to rescue him. When ends up happening is a series of fight scenes that are actually pretty good (not quite John Wick great, but certainly better than average), although I was disappointed that Carano did not have all that many standout fight scenes. She was amazing in Steven Soderberg's ""Haywire"" and I'm still waiting to see her in an equally worthy of film since then. Overall, this low budget action film does feature some decent fight sequences that make it worth watching, but the film's overall low production value and rather thin story do make it pretty obvious to audiences that this is not a something of ""Die Hard"" or ""Haywire"" of quality. And D.B. Sweeney looks as if he too may have filmed all of his scenes in one day as well."
" Better than a lot of the garbage criticism makes it out to be.
",0.0,-0.4736,2018-05-11 00:00:00,7,"As an action-thriller with the neo-dark flair it's just fine. I never expected 'Jason Bourne' levels of plots and conspiracies, so the movie is easy to follow. Phair lady Gina Carano deserved more screen-time, she was sort of a wasted talent in this and was proll'y not supposed to upstage Kellan Lutz who did a good job overall - he's believable as a tough guy. Bruce Willis has very limited screen time - an aging movie tough guy passing the torch.For me, it works.I'd simply ignore some of the ""reviews"" on this site. Not the low ratings, which are alright... Unsubstantiated trash-talk however, carries zero weight.Maybe some of the main criticism stems from people expecting to watch Willis in an alternate 'Die Hard' lead role. This one is technically a 5.5-6.0/10 for me, but a 7.0 to counter a lower than deserved rating is fair."
" SO THE PLAN IS, YOU HAVE NO PLAN
",-0.296,0.9578,2018-04-29 00:00:00,5,"Leonard Turner (Bruce Willis) is a crusty old CIA agent who may or may not be retired. He is kidnapped in Newark, along with the Condor, a device that can hack everything. Harry (Kellan Lutz) also works for the company as a desk agent in Prague. Harry had been working on the Condor, but his boss wants him home. Harry goes rogue to save his dad and the world. He teams up with his old girlfriend (Gina Carano) in New JerseyThe film was actually filmed in Alabama, except for the flyover which was Pittsburgh. There was a lot of hand to hand fighting with cliche scenes starting with the opener as Leonard is tied up and given a pen. Who didn't see that coming? The fight scenes were so-so and Gina Carano was unconvincing. The whole plot seemed weak.Not the best Bruce Willis film out there, but better than that one where he dies early and his son has to use his cell phone (The Cold Light of Day). Guide: F-bomb.

" Far better film than it gets credit for ...
",0.6705,0.9875,2018-03-12 00:00:00,6,"No spoilers. Simple plot with twists. The acting in an action film are limited to the action presented. Of course this isn't a realistic CIA film. First, there are no CIA ""agents"", there are operatives and officers, but agents are an FBI title. Second, the plot is fairly simple, but actually well done. Third, the production values are rather high for a straight to video film.
The fight sequences are pretty well done, Gina Carano is a fine film fighter and so are Kellan Lutz and Bruce Willis, age notwithstanding.
There are enough plot twists to keep this interesting, within its genre.
No, this isn't the high speed, top of the line Tom Cruise actioner, yet it has its moments. So, no whining about the less than stellar costs associated with it. Given a larger budget and better writing it could have been a far better film. The writing is what makes the film suffer.
All in all it was entertaining and for those of us who've been waiting for a new Bourne Identity, this isn't it, but it might have been.
So, take it for what it is and enjoy the action and shut up. Predator was not much better an actioner and certainly some of Arnie's 1980s action flicks were no better. Kellan Lutz and Gina Carano have careers as action stars and given better scripts and some experience under their belts have the ability to make some fine films in the future. If there is a real disappointment here, it's Bruce Willis who could have phoned in his performance, perhaps his payday wasn't as large as he's used to?"
" Less enjoyable than a tooth extraction
",0.3832,0.66,2018-01-18 00:00:00,4,"I have found that a typical formula for successful (i.e. decent to good) action movies involve adding one part mega action star and one part juicy action story involving espionage or military engagement or something similar. ""How can it go wrong?"" is my thinking. ""A mega action star would never agree to this movie if the story is bad."" Well, this movie proves my formula is not exactly foolproof. I settled in to watch ""Extraction"" knowing only that it featured Bruce Willis and possibly that it involved the CIA. By the end of the movie, it's fair to say that this isn't really a Bruce Willis movie at all since he plays second fiddle to actor Kellan Lutz, who plays a character named Harry Turner. Now if someone asked me, ""Do you want to watch a Kellan Lutz movie about the CIA?"", I might say, ""I don't know...it might not be good if a familiar actor isn't the lead."" Having watched this movie, my words would be justified. A fundamental clue that it would be poor was in the editing. The producers decided to adopt the kind of accelerated-timeline editing approach which is the death knell for action films. I don't know the motivation for this approach, but it really needs to stop. Nothing says ""STOP SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF"" as does the speeding up of events to cram as much action as possible into a very small window of time. It makes a story much less believable, it saps characters of development, it can be hard to follow for viewers, and it makes it a challenge for the viewer to care about what is going on. In addition to the editing, the story line itself was rather horrid. The use of cliches has already been commented on, but beyond that it was just boring and lacked credibility. Would a desk-level CIA employee really decide to crack the heads of four other agents because he couldn't go on a rescue mission to help his father? Is one agent still working for the CIA going to feed secret information to that now-rogue CIA employee? I guess they don't really care about job security there. Was there a reason that part of the story takes place in Prague when we only get to see office shots? The list goes on.All of this was aggravated by the ridiculous acting performances we see here. Bruce Willis, should be ashamed of himself. D.B. Sweeney has seen better days. I actually did not mind the performance of Kellan Lutz, but the real sore thumb was the acting of Gina Carano. Before watching ""Extraction"", I did not know who she was, but she looked vaguely familiar. I eventually realized that her performance was so wooden that she must have received her starring role for some reason other than her acting chops (I suspected she was a singer trying for a move to the movies, but it turns out she's an MMA fighter trying to get into acting). If you don't know what I mean, simply contrast her performance with the animated performance of the actress who played her roommate. Even if you think the roommate's performance was nothing special, it was still noticeably better than Carano's. Overall, there was too much dragging this movie down. A few positives might be found, but not enough to make this movie anything but one to skip."

" Gets by on the fight scenes alone
",-0.5574,0.5922,2018-01-11 00:00:00,5,"EXTRACTION is an acceptable B-movie thriller with a lead role for THE EXPENDABLES 3 actor Kellan Lutz and a guest part for Bruce Willis. They play father-and-son agents who are left grieving when Willis' wife is murdered by gangsters. Ten years later, a valuable hacking device is stolen and Willis kidnapped, forcing his son to go into action to rescue him. This is a simple and low budget tale that's well directed by Steven C. Miller, the man behind THE AGGRESSION SCALE. Willis doesn't get much screen time and seems a bit bored by it all but Lutz makes an effort and seems to have grown as an actor since the last time I saw him. The story is nothing special and features a few twists along the way. Gina Carano shows up as Lutz's ex and turns out to be a major ally, but her acting abilities are really limited here and I felt embarrassed by her attempts at humour. Still, the film does get by on a series of crunchy, well-choreographed fight scenes which feel inspired by BOURNE. The best is the bathroom fight against the assassin which is really neatly done."
" I will never watch a movie with Kellan Lutz again
",0.0,0.9312,2017-11-11 00:00:00,2,"Typical CIA tough guy dad and wannabe ""never going to happen"" son. Kellan should have been called Kelly, coz I found the chicks in the movie had more muscle power.Kellan shows us that he is definitely not fit to be a field CIA agent and is better off behind a desk pushing paper. He gets beat up all over the place. The Asian dude had his number for sure. Luckily the Asian guy was in the movie for a short scene. If it were real life Kellan would have his butt in a sling right then. The women seemed more hero types displaying action worth with they guns, cars and hands. Kellan was more like the little butterfly that needed to be saved every now and then. If I were him, I'd send the script back and pick unemployment. Of course, he needed the money and probably a chance to showcase talent. But the movie was a talent killer. Maybe he should try ballroom dance.Its OK if you want to watch an action fight movie when you got nothing else to kill time. Beyond that, it just seemed poorly plotted and one for the forgettable files."
" A waste of Carano's presence
",-0.4215,-0.7237,2017-11-06 00:00:00,3,"This is not a great film, you'll be very glad for the few moments when you can relax to any minute of passable film-making. The dialogue is hammy with lots of over-exposition. The plot is just sloppy. Some of the story is based on the ignored professionalism of the lead, which he then proceeds to demonstrate none of. And everyone has guns but punches their way everywhere. Strangely tho, the end does have a decent twist. Sadly not enough by a long shot to save it.Unfortunately the lead is without charisma which colours all his interactions, and gives zero chemistry to the relationships. While Carano still might be finding her acting feet, I think she has a real screen presence, but it is horribly wasted here. Willis essentially makes a cameo, and while he sleepwalks thru it, is dependable. Generally the supporting cast are embarrassing except for a really good performance by Lydia Hull (even if the direction left the tone misplaced)."

" A Ridiculous Movie Further Degraded by a Paint-by-the-Numbers Approach
",-0.6486,-0.5128,2017-09-06 00:00:00,3,"This movie essentially begins with a veteran CIA field agent by the name of ""Leonard Turner"" (Bruce Willis) being abducted by terrorists who also manage to seize a valuable piece of computer technology from him in the process. Naturally, considering the impact this package might have on the security of the United States an immediate effort is made to find those responsible and either regain or disable the computer device before it can be used. As it so happens, Leonard has a son named ""Harry Turner"" (Kellan Lutz) who works as an agent for the CIA as well but because he hasn't been certified as a field agent he is not allowed to become involved in the rescue of his father or the reacquisition of the computer equipment in any manner. Harry, on the other hand, has no interest in sitting on the sidelines and as a result he decides to disobey orders and go it alone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this has to be one of the most ridiculous films I have seen in a long time as it completely ignores both reality and common sense. Not only that but the film seemed to follow a paint-by-the-numbers approach which further degraded it even more. In short, this wasn't a very good movie and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

Despite his reservations, his son Harry (Kellan Lutz) has joined the agency. Leonard has called in every favor to keep Harry sitting behind a desk. Ken Robertson (D.B.

Harry escapes from his handlers to try to rescue his father while retrieving Condor. His ex Victoria Phair (Gina Carano) is the agent on the ground.This movie has a bad trifecta. Willis has been phoning it in for a long time. Both Lutz and Carano have questionable acting skills. The best that I can say is that Carano has loosen up a little and seems semi-human. It doesn't help that this movie is the definition of cheap B-action movie. The writing is weak. The setup is perfunctory. The action is not as big as it needs to be. It's slightly better than a bad TV movie but that's not a high bar."

The movie is a sub C made-for-TV kind of junkie movie. Poor Writing, dialog, fight scenes, car chases, consistent logic of story are not made up for by quality actors. The hurky jerky camera work is sickening, literally. The nonsense story of a supposedly talented agent going off with no plan along with a goofy destroy the world device makes this lower than it should be. It could have been a passable B movie. Car chase scene where the cars just drive around until the bad guy just stops to be hit by the hero. Unbelievable, literally. The lead makes so many stupid judgments and decisions it could almost be a parody.I gave it a 2 because I pity the good actors. He never thinks ahead nor has a plan in the entire movie.
