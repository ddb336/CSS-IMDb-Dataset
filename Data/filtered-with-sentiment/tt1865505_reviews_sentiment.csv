" Gorgeous and charming
",0.8316,0.9538,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"This lovely story tells of a girl who can become a seal and her brother's attempts to help her. It's magical, visually stunning, and one of the most charming non-Miyazaki cartoons I've seen. It's easily the best of Cartoon Saloon's Irish folktale trilogy (I'd almost rate this a 9, but not quite), and is full of ingenious and lovely moments.Highly recommended."

" Enchanting!
",0.0,0.9029,2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I came across this film a couple years ago, on Netflix, while looking for something for my kids to watch. I have always been interested in myths & legends, so the premise appealed to me right away.The animation was absolutely beautiful. It's not realistic but it looks like something out of a children's story book. The story itself is enchanting. Even my son, 7yrs, looked up from his video game to watch. My 2 yr old daughter also stopped to watch, particularly during the singing parts. The music is hauntingly beautiful. The story is suitable for any age.It centers around selkies but also includes many other creatures and characters from legend. Think twice before passing this one over."
" Perfect in every way
",0.5719,0.8122,2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,Magical and moving. Good for the soul. Had me my husband and my two children mesmerised from the start. It made me want to be in the sea. Absolutely beautiful.

" For the blind, I mourn
",-0.6705,0.7096,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,All I can say is I was I was mesmerized by outrageously gorgeous colorscapes created for this production. Simply beyond my capacity to understand how a human could create such landscapes of color.
" A beautifully animated Irish folk tale. Totally worth watching.
",0.7089,0.9526,2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"The story revolves around the myth of the selkie - a magical mermaid, basically, but the main character is a small human boy who misses his mother and begrudgingly protects his little sister. The animation is very beautiful and the celtic mythology seamlessly integrates with the modern world via compelling and layered characters. The film is entertaining to both adults and children.There are other animated films by the same guy, Tomm Moore, and I am going to watch them all. He's like an Irish Miyazaki!"
" Unique animation steeped in Irish folklore.
",0.0,0.9731,2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,"In perusing Netflix a while ago, I came across Song of the Sea (2014), a nominee for the Best Animated Feature Oscar that had completely gone under my radar. At first glance, this film seemed to be by the same people who had done The Secret of Kells (2009). I appreciated the 2D style of the animation from Kells and looked forward to additional stories that could be told in that style. I was not disappointed in the visuals, but I was confused, perhaps more than I should have been with the plot.Don't get me wrong: the plot is pretty simple. I certainly was able to understand the story of a brother and his mystical mother and sister. Some of the plot points seemed pretty cliche, all things considered. What I had trouble with was some of the Irish folklore that ran throughout this movie. Perhaps it was all part of a singular ""fairy"" portion of their lore that tied it all together, but it seemed to jump around from glowing seals to stone singers to owl grandmothers with little connection between them.Despite my lack of understanding of Irish folklore, Song of the Sea is still a touching film. There's genuine emotion in these animated characters, and I could really relate with the father (Brendan Gleeson), as well as with Saorise (Lucy O'Connell). The visuals and fantastical elements do work well for the animation style, and I can't wait until I can watch the next film in this ""trilogy,"" the most-recent Wolfwalkers (2020). I always appreciate foreign animated films, so I would highly suggest that people who are tired of the same kinds of animated movies put out by American studios give movies like Song of the Sea a watch.Unique animation steeped in Irish folklore, I give Song of the Sea 4.0 stars out of 5."
" Absolutely beautiful film
",0.6361,0.9267,2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This is such a calming movie. The animation is simple, but beautiful; and the score is enchanting. I loved every bit."
" A nice change of pace
",0.4215,0.8939,2020-11-18 00:00:00,10,The look and feel of the animation style in this film is very distinctive and personal. The colors are all subdued and shifted into the twilights blues. The design is distinctly Celtic and yet it feels like nothing I have seen before. I could get lost in these images forever. It is really nice to see an aminated film that has such a personality to it.The story is a little bit confusing (it might be because I am lacking the cultural context) but even so there is an emotional power here that makes the story as striking as the animation. The film is so wonderfully different.
" ""You see, without her coat, the selkie has no voice.""
",-0.296,0.9581,2020-10-14 00:00:00,7,"It can be said for ""Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion"", another picture I'll be getting to in due time. So without raining on anyone's parade, I don't see how this movie rises to the level of a Top 250 contender. Yes, it's a cute film, well made, carefully animated with an original story, but ultimately that's all it was for me. It tugs at the heartstrings a bit, and does have a warm, family friendly vibe to it, even if the mother Bronach returns to the sea at the finale in her guise as a selkie. I did like the Irish Gaelic songs that the character of Saoirse voiced, particularly the one that broke the spell on Mac Lir and brought the stone fairies back to life. Somehow though, this didn't rise to the level of a film that one would consider among the best off all time. For this viewer, something more substantive would have been necessary to seal the deal."
" One of the most spectacular moviye I've ever watched
",0.0,0.7892,2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is simply spectacular, one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched in my entire life. The animation, the storyline, everything is woah! Simply mind-blowing. Everyone should watch it atleast once in their life time. Recommended for all ages, the storyline is so simple even a kid would totally understand it crystal clear. Watch it without any second thoughts or hesitations. It's wowwwww! I could've given 100‚≠ê's if it were possible."
" ""A Selkie's Song Set Free""
",0.5106,0.9861,2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.The animation in this beautiful, and some of it reminds me (vaguely) of ""Spirited Away"", but makes more sense. I'm sure the relation is the sense that ""Spirited Away"" is Miyazaki's display of the Japanese fey, though it is apparently in several other movies (e.g. ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Ponyo"").This is a movie of great tragedy and powerful feelings, but ultimately is about appreciating your family and people while they are there. There is charm and uplifting feelings to the entire situation: you're not just going to be depressed or moved.As the introduction of the fey start, it is very unclear what is real and what is magic, or if the magic is real. That surreal attitude to this child's adventure seemed to add to the charm of dealing with the situation.The only problem I have with the movie is this ambiguity, there are so many parallels (that often occur in fey stories) to reality that you can't tell if this is a story of how a boy imagined an adventure, or if it's a fey story full of hidden magic.The details they go into are amazing if you look. Even the tears shared between fey and human are different. The details go on, and while I'm not sure if the quality is better, worse, or just different to a Miyazaki film, I feel it was made with the same consideration for how the audience is supposed to feel as they watch in the same way he created."
" I almost want to believe that magic is real after watching this movie
",0.0018,0.9933,2020-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I didn't expect to shed a tear after watching this movie but I did. The story was rich with themes of love and loss and every song, inspired by Celtic folklore, has the melancholic and lilting Celtic sound fitting so well and hauntingly with the story's emotional mood. I couldn't keep my emotions sealed in those jars since this movie took me to emotional heights that I'm yet to get down from and haven't visited for a while.I'm pretty much used to the 3D computer-animated styles of Disney and Pixar so the animation over here was like a fresh breeze of air to me. It kind of reminds me of old Russian cartoons with a bit of a modern touch. Yes, it's a bit unusual but in all the best ways because the visuals are stunning. It swirls with pastels that morph into imaginative lines capturing humans and mystical beings in their primitive, yet imaginative, visuals. The character design is charming without being too cute or stereotypical and every character looks unique. I almost want to believe that magic is real after experiencing these visuals."
" Almost a ten
",0.0,0.4779,2020-07-20 00:00:00,7,"I truly loved this film with one exception. There is a scene where some of the characters have a barrel top for a door. On it is written ""keep out- no humans- and Feic off"" The words Feic Off should not be in a children's film and is completely unacceptable to any parent."
" Beautiful masterpiece
",0.8402,0.9716,2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is 100% on point. It's beautifully done, with great music, a great story, character development you actually care about, and it deals with some complex themes. Also, have Kleenex handy, your gonna cry like a baby.One of the best part is while most animation nowadays is done with CGI, this movie is mostly hand drawn, with CGI highlights that don't call attention to themselves or detract from the movie."

" A beautiful and enchanting animation!
",0.636,0.9971,2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"""Song of the Sea"" is a story inspired by the Celtic folklore tradition of the selkie. The story primarily focuses on Ben and his little sister Saoirse. Together, they go on an adventure to free the fairies and save the spirit world.""Song of the Sea"" tells a really beautiful story through the use of gorgeous 2D animation. I really love how the movie developed the brother-sister relationship between Ben and Saoirse. ""Song of the Sea"" is also moving and heartfelt. It has a really touching ending that moved me to tears.""Song of the Sea"" kinda reminded me of ""Spirited Away"". There are definitely some parallels between the two movies. Even the character design of Macha from ""Song of the Sea"", bears a striking resemblance to Yubaba from ""Spirited Away"".The animation is spectacular and visually-mesmerizing. The animators did an amazing job of creating and designing an atmosphere that feels enchanting and magical. The use of colors is also very good in ""Song of the Sea"".The soundtrack for ""Song of the Sea"" is amazing. It does a very good job of setting the tone and mood for the movie. Very soothing and beautiful.The voice acting in ""Song of the Sea"" is delivered and performed brilliantly. I am really impressed by the voice acting of David Rawle (Ben), Brendan Gleeson (Conor/Mac Lir) and Fionnula Flanagan (Granny/Macha).Overall, ""Song of the Sea"" is a beautiful and enchanting animation. It's a movie that is perfect for both children and adults. I highly recommend it."
" A cute little fantasy film if you like that sort of thing
",0.6705,0.8658,2020-06-04 00:00:00,5,"I should probably just say up front that I often struggle with fantasy stories that focus on a lot of magical and mystical things. Song of the Sea is a film that fully embraces the world of fairies, spirits, and other magical beings. It is connected with Irish folklore, which is something I know little about, aside from the concept of selkies. Needless to say, I had a hard time getting fully invested in this story, and remained a bit checked out through the whole thing. There were also a number of logic questions that kept coming to mind, and I had to remind myself that a fantasy adventure requires some suspension of disbelief, no different than one of my superhero movies. Who knows why I can fully buy into the fact that a human being can turn into a giant green rage monster, and yet I struggle when one turns into a seal, but for some reason my brain fights against this kind of fairy tale.The plot that I cared about was the big brother trying to watch out for his little sister, and when I could overlook the mystical mumbo-jumbo, I enjoyed seeing how he grew from resenting her into genuine affection. They did a good job of building up his character in the early scenes, and you could understand the arc of his emotional journey through the film. It felt a bit like everyone else was a non-character, though. The sister does so little, and is merely a damsel in distress. The parents are not in most of the film, to the point that the villains have more of a stake in the story than them. I will say that the art style of Song of the Sea was adorable. It has a cute childlike quality to it that I enjoyed. One final thing I have to mention, the titular song was a bit overused in the film. I was starting to get tired of it by the end, and considered it annoying when the tune was stuck in my head afterwards. Clearly, Song of the Sea isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it had some elements that I appreciated, even though I doubt I'll be watching it again."
" Sweet bedtime story
",0.4588,0.9709,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"The thing with the indie animated movies is that we usually get a unique visually striking way to introduce ourselves into a pecular world, and a pecular story, that we don't hear every day.I think that is beautiful, but I always find something in the plot that doesn't immerse me into the story, not at all.
There is always something missing, that they don't tell us, and sometimes we don't realize, cause we find ourselves lost in the greatest visual art.I hope to listen a story as good and well-cared as their visuals.Anyway, if you are not very meticulous, this is a charming, adorable movie."
" Magical story
",0.0,0.5859,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"I've heard this film described as the ""Irish equivalent of Spirited Away"" and I can see that. It has a magical story with compelling child characters and many mythological elements. The story also has an emotional aspect to it that pays off."
" Saoirse the Silkie's Fate is Sealed as a Human
",0.0,0.9013,2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"We all loved this film, which, along with Secret of Kells, represents a major achievement for Irish animation (and Cartoon Saloon, more precisely). The close parallels between the fairy, human, and natural world are striking: Conor mourns his departed silkie wife like the giant MacLir; his mother, who criticizes him for his grief and tells him to forget about the night she went into the sea, is like (the same as?) Macha. It is the children who control this connection with the fairy world, and in the end, after they free the fairies from their stone fate, they choose to sever it: the spirits depart, and Saoirse elects to remain a human. So, unlike Secret of Kells, where Christianity cautiously interacts with the magical natural world, and captures it in the manuscript, in Song of the Sea, the modern world (and Saoirse, Ben, and Conor) ultimately let it go, like letting go of their mother. It is a poignant, though not explicit message of the film. Witness the contrast between dirty, industrial Dublin and the seaside town where the silkies frolic; they can only come out on Halloween night, when the film takes place. Amazingly, my daughter Sienna caught an image of the forest spirit Ashlyn, from Secret of Kells, riding the bus from Dublin out to the country side. We wondered: was it really her, or just a kid dressed up as her for Halloween? Great film."
" What's strong
",0.5106,0.7936,2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"There are many stories of loss, loss of loved ones, loss of youth... even loss of your dog. Ben's story is just one of many, and we all know what happens when he's mean to his sister, saoirse, because he's buried at sea with his mother and his ability to love. The OWL witch turned her son to stone with her own hands. The Tears of her son did not set off the storm of the world, but stirred her heart to the ground. It was like you were slapped by your mother, there's a lot of suffering out there. The slap on the son, but the pain killed the witch. ""Now, if someone said he could take away the pain, would you allow him to help you? "" Seal off the bad feelings and let the world smile warmly. You naively believe that if you can never lose your temper, you can return to the original appearance.
One day, you find yourself cultivated, invulnerable, heart as quiet as stone, calm, you control the reason of the biggest enemy, think that they finally have the ability to do everything, can firmly go anywhere. However, do not cry will not hurt you, how can you still know happiness, your heart is too heavy, has long forgotten the feeling of flying, it is the fear and beauty of the intertexture, it is falling into the abyss without hesitation. Your walk is meaningless."
" Song of the Sea lyrically paints Irish folklore with limited narrative brushing techniques.
",-0.2263,0.9353,2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,"In Celtic and Gaelic mythology, a selkie is a seal with the ability to shed its skin and become human, a process known as therianthropy. The enormous Mac Lir, commonly associated as the Sea God, was a noble warrior. A valiant knight suffering an eternity of pain due to the loss of his lover. His tears would heighten the ocean's water levels to gargantuan heights, placing the coastal civilians of Ireland at risk. His mother, Macha, relinquished Mac Lir of his melancholy. Portrayed as an Owl Witch, she stole his raucous emotions thus turning him into stone. Determined to rid the emotional output from everyone, including herself. The seal folk, now destined to release musically inclined faeries from their petrified state of stone, must act fast before the path to T√≠r na n√ìg closes forever. Leaving the whimsical creatures as mere decorative ornaments in this world.Cartoon Saloon's second feature, founded and directed by Moore himself, continues the exploration of Irish mythology from 'The Secret of Kells'. A mystical realm nestled in stupendous folklore and grandiose mythos. Reminiscent that of a bedtime story, Moore's ornate sense of world building is unequivocally outstanding. The blustery Irish Sea. The endless fields of rural countryside. Magical ruins sprinkled throughout the landscape. Moore's team of illustrators have, once again, produced a flawlessly designed animation that repeatedly expresses the creativity behind hand-drawn techniques. Its style, from repetitious swirls to water-coloured backdrops, grants the other-worldly story a consistent mythical presence. Character models, particularly animals such as wild seals and pet sheepdog C√∫, inhibited a child-like aesthetic that reminded maturer audiences of the imaginative stories they grew up with, and how we perceive them now. Those accustomed to Irish folklore tales will be familiar with the creatures on display, supplying bountiful amounts of imagination throughout.There's a hint of influence from Ghibli's Miyazaki that transforms a relatively unknown culture into an attempted accessible family-friendly animation. The score, ranging from ethereal ocean waves to Irish folk music, heighten the central mystical premise of ""Song of the Sea"". A melody that acts as a portal, a line of communication, between the human world and the faeries. Voice acting was solid all-round, Rawle in particular was a stand out. Gleeson's sorrowful tones adding an ounce of delicacy to the emotional output.However, for all the justified acclaim Song of the Sea has received, alas it is a story with basic storytelling capabilities. For Ben and his younger half-human half-selkie sister Saoirse, who traverse the land in desperation for solace, the merging between T√≠r na n√ìg and reality places them in the midst of a story about courage and familial love. Ben treats Saoirse poorly, jealous of the attention she receives. Their father, a lighthouse keeper named Conor, send the children away to live with their grandma in the city, due to the increasing dangers of living on a remote island. The family is internally suffering with grief, after the disappearance of their selkie mother Bronagh, whom Ben blames Saoirse for. Their quest to save the petrified faeries is simultaneously a journey of reconciliation. For a family to move on as a collective unit. The overbearing problem is with how the fictitious tale of mythology is unable to blend with the complexities of this real family. Moore, equipped with Collins' script, expends most of the runtime detailing the components of the folklore story. A story that is indeed painted on the very walls of Ben and Saoirse's bedroom. This grants the characters several opportunities to produce expositional dialogue regarding the mythos behind Mac Lir.Due to the inaccessibility of the world Moore is attempting to illustrate, with many having no prior knowledge, he had no choice but to explain every single component heavy-handedly. When Ben meets the Great Seanacha√≠, whom still remains unknown to me, the plot's entirety is spelt out to us with restricted characterised consequence. Ben reacts for a second when given his next task, only to then rapidly move onto the next question or piece of exposition. Yet, despite being explained the story, certain narrative aspects still felt ignored, as if the audience should've known beforehand. A selkie is not explained. At all. The visual storytelling alone may elude to the capabilities a selkie possesses, but it then requires further research to clarify those initial findings. Arguably, the more engaging aspect of the tale was the familial drama that had subsided after the first act. Conor seemingly exiting the feature had consequently relinquished the melancholia that powered the visual style. Only to surmise their familial woes in the climactic lyrical performance.Moore's second feature is too monotonous for adults, yet too complex for children. The abundance of imagination and gorgeous visual styles pushes this animation to admirable heights, however personally constantly finding myself at a crossroad. Yearning to love a film that deserves so much attention, but only managing to like it. Unable to connect to a story of grandeur and wondrous mysticism. Song of the Sea drowns me in a world of heavy lore and light relatability."

" This is a genuine animation gem.
",0.0,0.996,2019-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Upon winning an Oscar nomination for his exquisitely animated film The Secret of Kells in 2009, for his follow-up, Song of the Sea, director Tomm Moore accomplished the same again. He lost the Oscar to Disney's Up in the first case and again won in Big Hero 6 for the second time by Disney. Nonetheless, watching Moore's films tackle these big hitters is still great. Ben and his little sister Saoirse are sent to stay with their aunt following their mother's death while their father is still in mourning. They take it upon themselves to find their own way back home by embarking on a fantastic journey across the ocean where they are tasked with liberating faeries and protecting the spirit world while exploring the mystery and ancient mythology of the Selkies-mythical seals that can transform into human form when on shore. Like in The Secret of Kells, Moore is again concentrating on Irish mythology and imbuing the whole story with the same ethereal beauty that he used in his debut so brilliantly. His traditional, hand-drawn animation in an age of over-produced computer-generated content is a joy to behold and so refreshing. With only two movies (and an upcoming addition to a chapter of The Prophet by Khalil Gibran), Moore was listed in a similar light to the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki for his ability to create his own magical and enchanting tales. Personally speaking, I believe the Miyazaki analogy is far too late, but Moore is undeniably a star, irrespective of that. His universes and creativity can be fantastic at times, and Sea Song is a beautiful piece of storytelling. He has minor pacing problems, but, like The Secret of Kells, and younger viewers can find their attention challenged. That being said, the flaws this happened to that film have been modified a bit. His narrative is deeper and more interesting and his decision to stick with the musician Bruno Coulais and the Irish folk group Kila leads to a perfectly fitting score reflecting and complimenting the spirit of Celtic mythology. A fascinating and beautifully crafted fable of rights-of-passage where the narrative and symbolism interweave almost perfectly. Last year's Oscar nomination was absolutely deserved and very disappointed to bow out to Big Hero 6. The Academy is well known for making wrong choices, but it is incredibly disappointing that they would ignore this in favor of something that just happened to make more money. This is a genuine animation gem."

",0.5994,0.9501,2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is beautiful with a moving storyline, character relationships, and a hauntingly beautiful score. It is a touching story of loss and how the love found between family helps to heal if you open yourself to it.
The Irish mythology is wonderfully wound throughout with selkies, the owl witch Macha, and the giant who cried an ocean.
I use this movie as part of our St. Patrick's Day celebrations, and it's the perfect addition to the other activities I was doing."

" A Simply Told Compelling Animated Aventure
",0.2263,0.9541,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"17 August 2016. What makes this animated feature children's movie stand out is its simplicity. The fresh, but simple flowing animated scenes, without the details of 3-D like Caroline (2009) or Paddington (2015), allows for the story to be the headliner and focus on a story legend capture the audience under its spell. Song of the Sea is even more softly tinged with flourishing beauty than the more solid tones of animated dog of Bolt (2008). This product of Ireland echoes the Japanese focus on story over technical finesse of animated technology as From Up on Poppy Hill (2013) and Spirited Away (2001). This film is fresh and more lyrical mythic visually dream-like approach to animation of a very appealing legend."
" An enchanting tale of the strong bonds of family.
",0.5106,0.991,2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,"After watching all three feature films from Cartoon Saloon (Secret of Kells, this one and Breadwinner) I have high hopes for director Tomm Moore and company, because this one takes the crown as one of the most beautiful animated feature films in recent years! The other two are as goergously animated, but Song of The Sea has this one spark which makes it a masterpiece.Even though it's a fantasy film, it really conveys a strong message of loving and letting go told through Cartoon Saloon's signature style with vibrant colours and great attention to detail and unlike The Secret of Kells it managed to go a little less in on the shapes of the characters and making them a little more realistic without sacrificing their artistic touch.As for the characters, they are well made and relatable, but I must confess that our main character, Ben, is one of those protagonists you have to warm up to, because of how he starts out as a jerk. But it's part of his character growth which makes him so much more sympathetic.I won't go into much more about the movie, but in short I'll say that Song of the Sea is a beautiful animated movie bound to capture your heart. Cartoon Saloon and its core members really deserve more attention."
" ThIs deserved Academy Award
",0.5423,0.9344,2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,Amazing animated movie. I don't know how it didn't win Oscar. I mean Big Hero 6 is also good and cool animated movie but it just isn't better than Song of the Sea. Love the soundtrack and song of the sea is amazing.
" One of my favorite animated features of all time
",0.4588,0.9945,2018-09-06 00:00:00,10,"Cartoon Saloon is a studio that has never ceases to amaze me. First with their film ""Secret of the Kells"" and continues to impress me with their film ""the Breadwinner"" that released after this. But to me, Song of the Sea is their biggest triumph, and can easily rival any of the animated classics out there. Firstly, the audio is beyond compare. The soundtrack is deep and moody in a fantastical sort of way. But also i'd regret not mentioning the additional sound design that helps put you directly into the film in a way I don't quite find in modern Disney films. The voice acting is also top notch. The designs and voices harmonize perfectly and not once do they sound unnatural or out of place.Speaking of the design, the look of the film is out of this world. Cartoon Saloon's unique voice as a studio is very simple, very shape based with unique textures that add that extra bit of depth and ground the characters in the world. If you're like me and fell in love with how they illustrate, i'd invest in the ""Art of"" book. It's 100% worth it. The narrative is heart-wrenching (prepare to cry) and fairly fresh. It's strength (and one of the strengths of the movie in general) is that the story is very Irish. Cartoon Saloon is a very Irish studio and I think they have a lot of pride in being able to express that through their work to the rest of the world. Hearing stories i've never seen before is something that Cartoon Saloon seems to be building a specialty for, and I hope you'll give this movie a chance for you to experience it yourself."
" Enchanting Irish Folklore Adventure

Director: Tomm Moore 
Watched: 8/8/18 
Rating: 8/10 {Clue: Sophomore effort from Moore's Cartoon ____ } Selkie folklore gorgeously portrayed- making therianthropy and shapeshifting appear magical rather than scary. Adorable side characters that are easy to fall in love with- from C√∫ the oversized shaggy dog to the scatterbrained Great Seanacha√≠ whose memory is ingrained in his many overlong strands of hair to the singing trio of Faeries to Macha the outwardly mean witch that is afraid of emotions. Looks like a children's storybook with its watercolor pastel palette and simple hand-drawn animation. Outstanding soundtrack with playful melodies, enchanting Irish folk artists, and traditional Gaelic songs. Ostensibly for young viewers, but older ones will benefit from heartfelt themes of loss, forgiveness, love, loyalty, family. Not your typical animated film- meandering in pace and content a little heavy-handed for children, but a mesmerizing adventure impossible not to be enchanted by. #Acrostic #PoemReview #AnimalLove #Animated #Irish #MagicalRealism #Shapeshifting"

" Stunningly beautiful story and animation!
",0.636,0.9736,2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,This is definitely one of my top 3 favorite movies! The animation style is uniquely gorgeous and the songs are hauntingly beautiful.

AMAZING movie!
" Simply and stunningly beautiful.
",0.5994,0.9867,2018-03-12 00:00:00,8,"'Song Of The Sea (2014)' is a straightforwardly beautiful folk-tale with a wonderfully kind and magically uplifting spirit. Its profound emotional payoff will surely bring a tear to the eye of even the most stone-hearted of giants. The animation itself is gorgeous, echoing the simple pure-soul of the piece, and the film's overall effect is one which makes you want to smile for quite a while, impressed that what you've just witnessed was aimed at children and yet touched you so deeply and effectively on an emotional and intelligent level. Profound, sometimes saddening yet pleasantly stirring. 8/10"

" From the shell, the Song of the Sea. Neither quiet nor calm, yet searching for love again
",0.7106,0.9988,2017-12-30 00:00:00,9,"After accomplishing wonders with The Secret of Kells, Tomm Moore and the people of Cartoon Saloon came back five years later with their second animated feature, Song of the Sea. Despite going under the radar in some countries, it was lauded by critics and got another Oscar nomination for best animated feature. As for my two cents, this once again trumps through visual storytelling and Gaelic culture, but it also contains more heart than that of Kells.Unlike Kells where it took place in ancient times, this film is set in modern times. It follows a family living on the lighthouse of an island where a young boy named Ben is happy with his father Conor and mother Bronaugh. One night while Bronaugh is soon to give birth to his sister, she vanishes into the sea while the daughter Saoirse is calmly born. Although unable to speak, Saoirse soon discovers that she is the last of the selkies, which are women in Irish legends that transform from seals into people. Along with Ben, they journey off to the sea to free the ancient fairy creatures trapped in the modern world.The most genuine aspect of Song of the Sea is the relation between Ben and Saoirse, as it feels very much like a typical albeit understandable sibling relationship. Although Ben is rather snooty to Saoirse throughout much of her life, it makes sense as he deals with the passing of his own loved one, who he felt Saoirse took her from her. However, as the film goes on and Ben and Saoirse subtly bond through their journey, not only does Ben improve as a brother, but he soon discovers why his mother left Saoirse alone to him and it really elevates the heartfelt emotional side of the movie. It's fine to be moody to your siblings as children, but you mustn't be so hard on them without thinking more about them, because there's a good chance they mean more to you than you take them granted for.Some characters are more stubborn and torn like Ben's dad and their granny, but it's no more for the fact that they either want what's best for their kin or are still dealing with a loss that affected them emotionally. However, the stand out characters are the mythical creatures such as the fairies, the goddess Macha, and the great Seanchai. Alongside offering their own quirks and distinct personalities through their looks and history, they all serve the plot on trying to either raise or subdue their folklore into the heavens to be free from such struggles, like being stuck on Earth.Speaking of folklore, the tales that the movie brings up are quite extraordinary. Aside from selkies, these tales contain all sorts of spirits that definitely feel as if they emerged from a children's storybook, complete with mystic and lavish Celtic designs. The way the story crafts them as entities soon to be faded unless they are restored from a lullaby in a dramatic tale of two children helps the film create a perfect contrast between reality and fantasy, not unlike Pan's Labyrinth but certainly more family friendly.Finally, the animation and music are just sublime. Along with simple but cute character designs, the character animation is quite smooth, the backgrounds are endlessly imaginative and even symbolic at times, the effects feel like a moving painting, and the use of color blends perfectly with the environments whenever needed for the scene. While dark blue is use phenomenally for sad and emotional scenes, there is always a light to create a sense of hope and wonder in such dark times. While the score is fun and upbeat from time to time, it can also be very heartbreaking when needed, and the main song feels like a lullaby that even an adult can listen to and feel comforted just by hearing it.If Studio Ghibli is seen as the modern legend of Japanese animation, then Cartoon Saloon has officially earned the title of the modern legend of Irish animation. By boasting creative artwork, well nuanced characters and a deep source for ancient Irish folklore, Song of the Sea is a refreshingly original and breathtaking tale just waiting to be talked about. I absolutely recommend this, not just to animation buffs and those interested in Irish culture, but even to those who once had moody but real relations with their siblings. It just might remind you of a time when you ratted on your siblings before realizing how much they really do mean to both you and the rest of your family, and this film will definitely feel reminiscent to you with its timeless appeal."
" Better than Disney, more shallow than the Japanese
",0.4404,0.9544,2017-12-10 00:00:00,6,"It's a pretty film, I imagine it goes well with children, though I found it slowly paced.Beautiful graphics, but in terms of story it doesn't compare to Ghibli. It talks a bit about Irish mythology (I guess? Celtic?), but you don't learn anything really.All these people saying how the film is super deep (for an animation! gosh, there ARE deep animations out there) never saw Princes Kaguya or, for example, the Wind Rises, Garden of Words, there are so many deeper Japanese animations.Bottomline: better than Disney (what isn't?), less funny than Pixar (but more beautifully animated), shallower than Ghibli. Now take your shot"
" Another beautiful animation from 'Cartoon Saloon'
",0.5994,0.965,2017-11-25 00:00:00,10,"This Irish animation opens of a remote island as Bronagh tells fairy tales to her young son Ben. She is heavily pregnant and suddenly states that she must leave. Six years later there is no sign of Bronagh; Ben is living with his father and Saoirse, the young sister who was born on the night his mother was last seen. Saoirse doesn't talk and Ben appears to resent her. On the night of her birthday she finds a strange coat in a locked chest; then she goes down to the sea and swims with the seals; it is clear that she is no ordinary child. In the morning she is found on the beach. Ben and Saoirse are taken to live in the city with their grandmother while their father puts the coat in the chest and throws it into the sea. Soon Ben decides to run away because he misses his dog; Saoirse follows, playing an instrument made from a seashell. The soon meet a group of fairies and it becomes clear that the tales their mother told him were true. This includes the story of Macha the Owl-witch who takes the feelings of magical beings and turns them to stone; if they are to be freed Saoirse must be reunited with the coat so she can sing the Selkie song. It won't be easy as Macha is aware of her.I found this film to be an utter delight, like Cartoon Saloon's previous offering 'The Secret of Kells' it features Irish mythology in a beautiful manner. The story is beautifully animated with charming characters and stunning backgrounds. The settings vary from the city to the countryside to a sea with waves reminiscent of those created by Japanese artist Hokusai. There is a sense of threat but nothing that should be too scary for younger viewers. Even Mocha, the antagonist of the film isn't actually malicious. The music that accompanies the story is charming and works well. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animation; it was something special; by the end I was both smiling and crying thanks to a bitter-sweet ending."
" Normal Animation Style Done Very Well
",0.3384,0.961,2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)This is a touching little story mixed in among some vaguely explained Celtic mythology. While the mythology and symbolism is vague, it did let me ponder the visuals and try to figure out some things. Helped to read IMDb reviews after watching. Aside from that, the tale kicks off with a pregnant mother who suspiciously leaves her husband and child. Later, the grandmother gets involved with the family. The meat of the story is hard to explain but the child goes on an adventure trying find the whereabouts of his mother and comes across other mythical experiences along the way, one being some special sweater, shawl, coat or something. The viewer is awash in beautiful and dreamy scenery with a pleasant film score accompaniment. Some of the vagueness is tied up in the end but the vagueness weakened my emotional connection a notch. Overall, it was a fun and unique film for those looking something that won't end up on kids backpacks, pajamas and stickers."
" Most Beautiful Animated Film Ever

The voice acting is brilliant, the sensitivity to character and Celtic tradition and myth are beautifully balanced. I watched it as an adult and was enchanted, but it's affect on kids is amazing. If you need a children's gift a copy of this film is perfect."

Unable to talk, Saoirse is starting to show special powers and sea creatures seem to respect her, indicating that she is no normal little girl.A sweet modern-day fairy tale. A linear adventure story that manages to stay reasonably focused and doesn't get too fantastical while introducing us to some intriguing characters. Mostly ideal for kids though adults won't mind it either. Quite difficult to dislike.Not very profound though - it is just a linear fantasy story, after all. So not brilliant, but still enjoyable."
" When a movie touch your heart....
",0.0,0.9912,2017-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Song of the Sea is an animated fantasy drama about a brother and a sister. It is a beautiful painting of an adventure that takes two siblings on an amazing journey. In between, they will try to save lives, find a way home and most crucial, look for unanswered questions. You may not find the description as unique as the movie actually is. The reason is, this movie is not just about the adventure, it's about what they find while they are on it. It is not some treasure I speak of, it is the feeling of love towards one another, a sense of caring. Also, it is about hope, which pushes you beyond your limit to make you brave enough to face your worst fears.The animation is over the top. It feels like we are looking at mere sketches but the characters feel real as you and me. So, when they will cry, you'll get emotional too. It is the powerful scenes like these because of which this movie is amazing. The song which the movie is all about is a melody to your ears and is nicely placed in the movie.I would say that those of you who watched and liked movies like ""A Monster Calls"" and ""Kubo and the two strings"", you will like this one too. All in all, it is an interesting watch for everyone."
" Stunning and wonderful 2D animated movie
",0.743,0.99,2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"This is a wonderful movie with wonderful artwork that really brought back my childhood. You know those vibrant and colorful story books with pictures that your elementary school teachers use to read to the students. Well it's kind of like that except it's like watching a moving children's story book that even adults can enjoy and be mesmerized with. It's rare to see amazing 2D animation movies that isn't from japan, so this movie was a treat to sit through. This is a stunning and hand-drawn animated folk-lore journey. That encompasses the importance of understanding, bonding and how good intentions might not always be the right choice. This is a wonderful 2D animated movie I would recommend to kids and adults.9/10"
