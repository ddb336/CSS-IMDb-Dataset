What always baffles me is people sitting and watch television and studying with constant talking and noise in the room, why bother."
" Man's Mistakes
",-0.3612,-0.7776,2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"That type of activities are done by all over world by organisation,family and single man but this movie is more than that.The head of the clan is father but others are feel very guilt coz they are knows one day we will caught or punished.Casting and acting was excellent.love, sentiment, guiltiness, master plans,money and many feelings around there. Extraodinary story telling."
" The stories of special families in specific historical periods range from cognitive divergence to final split
",0.4019,0.2732,2019-02-18 00:00:00,6,"The stories of special families in specific historical periods range from cognitive divergence to final split. Father and son are both good actors, one with no change of face, one with all one's heart, and the other with all one's hands and feet at a loss."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.5709,2019-01-07 00:00:00,4,"Since it is based on a true story, I expected more interesting scenes and actions. Too naive, everything is predicted, average criminals... nothing to deserve to make a film out of it."
" This is an Argentina/Spain co-production based on true events , being well paced , skillfully edited and very interesting .
",0.7841,0.9982,2018-11-07 00:00:00,7,"The most colorful epoch of criminality in Argentina during Galtieri's military dictatorship era is brought to life in this story of a robber and criminal family . As this family kidnapped and killed people in the 80s in a period of economical crisis when any employment, even illegal, was cherished, ambition, money and power originated an interminable cycle of fury and violence. It deal with the Puccio family led by the honorable daddy called Arquimedes : Guillermo Francella , he is going as far as to supervise the homework of his youngest daughter as a dedicated teacher . His eldest son is Alejandro, -Peter Lanzani- , a Rugby star champion . But actually Arquímedes Puccio turns out to be the tyrannical leader of a bunch of delinquents composed of his spouse and children. As they along with some accomplices carry out undercover activities , consisting in abducting wealthy people , detaining them in his own home , mistreating and torturing them and doing away with them after cashing the ransom.This is true story of the Puccio Clan, a model evil family , but their tale results to be a perverse stew of lies , violence , kidnapping , murders, pronounced bloodshed, sentimental blood bonding , and with a surprising ending . As an upright family -a model family whose well educated children have a promised and bright future- living their deep respectability , but is nothing but a smokescreen , being really a criminal group . The picture is plenty of thrills , intense drama , violence and thought-provoking issues . The main cast and support cast give magnificent interpretations . Here stands out Guillermo Francella who gives a masterful acting as the allegedly honest and dignified storekeeper by trade, who cares about his five children . As well as Peter Lanzani playing Alejandro Puccio , an admired rugby star .The motion picture well well produced by EL Deseo S.A. : Agustin and Pedro Almodóvar and professionally directed by Pablo Trapero . His films have covered the most important festivals, receiving critical acclaim and awards . Trapero is one of the biggest creative forces in Latin American Cinema .He has sat on the main Festival juries at Venice, San Sebastian and Locarno, among others . In 2014 he served as President of Un Certain Regard in Cannes. In 2015 the Ministry of Culture of France awarded him Chevallier Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, becoming the first south american director in receiving this honor. In 1999 Trapero directed his first feature, Mundo Grua, which won the Critics Prize at Venice. In 2002, he opened his production company, Matanza Cine, that produces films for fellow filmmakers, as well as his own. His second feature, El Bonaerense (2002) premiered at Cannes, Familia Rodante (2004) at Venice, and Nacido y Criado (2006) at Toronto. In 2008, Leonera, presented in Competition at Cannes, revealed the talent of Martina Gusman, muse, actress and producer of the cineaste. He returned to Cannes with Carancho (2010) and Elefante Blanco (2012), both in Un Certain Regard. Trapero is a good filmmaker , his best film was ¨Carancho¨, dealing with a slow burning exercise in moral decay and his usual actress results to be Martina Gosman who has worked in various film with him , such as : ¨Lion's den¨ , ¨Nacido y Criado¨ , ¨Carancho¨ and ¨Elefante Blanco¨ . This El Clan turns out to be a dramatic and provoking flick , an above average film and Argentina's official submission to Academy Award and it achieved several Prizes of the Argentinean Academy. With this his latest film, The Clan, he won the Silver Lion for Best Director in Venice International Film Festival . Indispensable and essential seeing for Guillermo Francella fans ."
" Why the high reviews?!
",0.0,0.5989,2018-08-17 00:00:00,2,"I found The Clan to be very disappointing...
The story itself if very captivating and you expect it to be somewhat as gripping as you'd think. The character building is decent you begin to like and dislike certain characters quickly. I felt the fact you don't see how those whom are being held hostage are living, you actually don't see them at all besides when the Father is making them write their ransom note, makes the movie more of a drama less of a thriller. They are crying and looked beat up you also don't see any abuse. I felt like those are key points of the story and the fact they don't also build on the hostage characters makes it less intense since your less emotionally involved... Just me."
" Good but kind of boring
",-0.3484,0.8612,2018-05-29 00:00:00,6,I did not like the movie as much as i liked the story its self. I belive it couldve been better since that the story is really good so i would recommend to read about it and watch some videos rather than watching the movie.
" Decent, though not compelling, docudrama
",-0.1695,0.5239,2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"The true story of the Puccio family of Buenos Aires, Argentina. During the height of the Galtieri regime of the early-to-mid 1980s the Puccio family, lead by senior government official Arquimedes Puccio, kidnapped and held for ransom several individuals. On more than one occasion they murdered their victims. This is their story.Decent, though not compelling, docudrama. Details well the events involved and these make for interesting following. However, not overly compelling viewing. Is pretty much a blow-by-blow account and feels quite dry at times.Not a must-see, but not a total waste of time either."
