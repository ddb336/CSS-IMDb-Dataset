" Great Film
",0.6249,0.9695,2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,Starts slow.. but stick with it and you'll see a great movie. Truly did not deserve the hate it got by critics. If you want a really scary movie.. this is not it. But it you want a beautiful gothic masterpiece with scary undertones you've got it. Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain are amazing. 10/10.
" This ranks up there with Stroker Ace
",0.0,0.9092,2021-03-14 00:00:00,4,"If this movie only had Burt Reynolds and Lonny Anderson it would have had a chance at the box office. Instead of the female lead of Ms Chastain Dom DeLuise would have been an improvement.
Mr DelToro really outdid himself. The last time I've seen direction this fine was coincidentally in another Bert Reynolds classic The Cannonball Run. It was shear genius.
Stephen King even gave a glowing review. I wonder if it was out of courtesy. You would think their art is more important than friendships."
" Should have been good, ruined by wide plotholes
",-0.0516,-0.9959,2021-03-13 00:00:00,3,"How much did I want to love this movie? A lot. How much did I like it when I saw it? Barely. I'll start with the little bit of positive - visually, it's gothicly gorgeous. Lush fabrics, dark manses, snowfall against stark backdrops, twisting hallways, phantoms, beeswax warm candlelight in dim rooms rich with wood paneling. When I saw the original trailers, I thought it would be just my kind of film. Then I watched it and felt bamboozled into a mess of a plot that asks the viewer to suspend all common sense, reason and thought. We are introduced to heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) as a child menaced by the creepy spectre of her recently dead and much loved mother and this is moment one I can't understand - why on earth is the ghost of a mother so loved and loving a terrifying visage? Why would she appear in a form to scare the wits out of her child? Then we jump to Edith all grown into an educated, sensible and insightful adult...who inexplicably ends up falling for shady stranger Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) after knowing him for about 35 seconds of dancing. Hmmm, sure, totally believable. Even when the father she loves and trusts tries to warn her off, shortly before being found dead under dicey circumstances, she persists in her infatuation, marries Sharpe and heads off to his estate in England about half a heartbeat after she's seen her father properly buried. And did I mention she also does this over the pleas of her childhood friend (a hotty with a crush on her) Charlie Hunnam, playing Dr. Alan McMichael? This sensible and smart young woman doesn't take even two moments to wonder why everyone she cares about is telling her to run? Nope. Then she gets to Sharpe's home, also populated by his disagreeable sister Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), and it has massive holes in the roof. Like the size of school buses. Another idiot plot point I hate - first off we are to believe Edith would just shrug and say, sure, seems legit, and two, that she wouldn't immediately insist on using the funds she actually has to make repairs? Because it's winter and basically if this was the real world everyone in the stupid mansion would freeze from exposure no matter how many fires they lit and all the wood would become rotted in a month and fall through. Also, there are no servants in this giant house. None. Not a one. Edith, a woman who grew up with every privilege and comfort and a house with the staff she would expect neither notices nor asks. Yet, everything in the mansion seems to get done - towels in the bathrooms, linens on the beds, candles, fires lit, etc. Seriously, it can't be Lucille doing all this, no one person could, and Edith isn't doing it. So, how is it happening? Never explained. Further, from day one, Edith spends most of her time alone in the desolate mansion and doesn't see Lucille or her husband anywhere for 20 hours a day, everyday, and never asks where they are. Sure. Then we come to the plot reveals - Lucille and Thomas have been having an incestuous relationship since they were adolescents and cooked up this scheme as adults to have Thomas marry rich heiresses with few relatives and lots of money, then kill them for the cash. They've done it before Edith several times. Yet, they still have no money currently despite all their huge windfalls and live inside a broken mansion with nearly no roof? Were they burning the cash from their previous kills in the fireplaces? I know we are to believe they've been putting a lot into Thomas' strange scheme to restart the family business, but doesn't it defy reason to think they didn't at least use the huge sum of money from killed wives one or two or even three to fix the place they live? Maybe replace a few carpets damaged by, oh, the snow and rain falling on them from the open roof? It's dumb. Lucille is revealed as the killer of Edith's father (Edith actually seems shocked to find out her father didn't just, oh, smash his own head straight through a 6 inch porcelain sink by accident - absurd) and then Lucille kills Thomas when they argue over Edith's fate. Edith's handsome friend from back home arrives, but stupidly brings no back up with him when he thinks she's in mortal danger. Why?? He's injured in short order, rendering him unable to save Edith and eventually Edith is aided momentarily by Thomas' ghost to dispatch a crazed Lucille. Later Edith and Alan leave the Sharpe mansion together and Lucille is now a ghost trapped there.In conclusion, I spent most of my time watching just yelling angrily at the screen over all the ridiculousness and it absolutely ruined the whole thing for me. If you don't much care for the quality of plotting, watch it for the visual pleasure. If you're like me and plotting and sense matter, skip it and save yourself the frustration."

" A very stylish gothic love story
",0.6666,-0.9872,2021-02-03 00:00:00,7,"A baronet from England arrived to their town with his sister Lucille and Edith fell in love with him while she was receiving warning from the ghost of her mother about crimson peak. Lucille killed her father and the scene was very brutal as she hit his head against the sink at the club's bathroom until it was cracked open. And then Thomas married her and take her to England with him. They started living in their dilapidated mansion with Thomas's machines for mining and red clay mine beneath the house. Butterflies in the attic, the hole in the roof, the basement with red clay and the lift and very gothic architecture of the house provided a strong atmosphere. Edith discovered some cylindrical phonographs and listened to them and found out they were the previous lovers of his husband and the Italian one was warning whoever listening to it about them trying to kill her by the poison in tea. She wanted to leave but they were snowed in. The eye doctor from her town in America arrived to the mansion because he was suspicious of Edith's fathers death and talked to the detective of the man and found out that Thomas is already married. Edith caught them making love in the attic and Lucille threw her off the rails. They were lovers and the girl killed her mother the one ghost that Edith saw with a cleaver in her head. He wanted to take her with him but Lucille stabbed him and Thomas faked finishing him and hid him in the basement because he was in love with Edith. Lucille couldn't accept his brother lover falling in love with someone else and stabbed him in the face. He died and she went after Edith. She took out the cleaver from the basement the one she killed her mother and they went out in the white snow and red clay capped garden. Edith could kill her when she was distracted with the ghost of Thomas and the doctor carried him away from the house as some people coming towards the house. It was a very stylish movie and I liked the mining machine of Thomas, the doctor's design to see ghosts, those cylindrical phonographs, gothic mansions and all but the script was a little bit weak and I expected a more surprising final as we already knew from the very beginning that Edith survives. But still it was definitely a nice gothic horror fairy tale about an aspiring young writer falling in love with a dangerous man and couldn't save herself from him despite his mother's ghost's warnings."
" A slow burn for most, but a great in-depth story
",0.7945,0.989,2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"The Short
Story: Story is exceptional with plenty of intrigue, suspense, and many factors that keep one interested and invested as to what may happen next.Characters: Acting allowed for the characters to have a life of their own and be completely believable as people.Effects: Visual effects and designs definitely cemented belief in the setting and situations, extremely well done visuals and sets.Lighting: Use of scene-based lighting rather than pure studio lighting is present in most scenes, allowing for added immersion.Sound Design: Sounds do not seem out of place and further add to immersion with their well-done designs.Themes: Set pieces, props, and clothing seem to be quite era-appropriate, once again allowing for a pleasant immersive experience.Expanded (no spoilers)
Though a simple story in premise with only a few unique parts to it, the story elements do not overstay their welcome, or flesh out to become something entirely different from what they were initially established as.The journey that our main characters go through feels natural and enjoyable, having them confront several stopping forces and through a combination of subtle to large changes, evolve as characters. Revolving primarily around three characters for most of the central plot means that there isn't a lot of room to flesh things out under ordinary circumstances, but with the well thought out plot, the characters are able to work off of each other and allows for a lot of small developments within them, going on to further breathe life into the world around them.Characters are established in various levels at the beginning, giving us enough to work with for some, and plenty with others. Though as the movie unfolds, more is learned about all of the characters, allowing for better understanding of what has led to them being the way that they are now, with some more of the twists and secret information being kept until very close to the ending sequence of the movie.Set across an interesting time in which harsh conditions and approval was of utmost importance, the movie manages to handle these themes competently and even manages to play around with them a little, almost leaving them as a backdrop to the overall concept of the movie without forgetting them and making sure that the audience feels connected to the characters.Lighting greatly enhances the immersion in this movie as in several scenes the lighting excels at creating atmosphere, reflecting character personalities, what they bring to the table, and most importantly, allowing a scene to feel correct with depth and lighting style.Extra (spoilers)
Filled to the brim with symbology right from the start, Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is plagued with the ability to see ghosts, including that of her own mother, which haunts her, though as we come to learn rather quickly, this is not a malicious spirit, and is benevolent and guiding, something shared by the other ghosts presented in the film.Suspense is successfully built up after the arrival of Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddlestone) and Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) when they have a short but crucial interaction with Edith's father, Carter Crushing (Jim Beaver). We quickly learn that all is not as it seems, though not quite at the depth revealed as the story continues.Edith is torn between two worlds from the very start, wanting to write about ghosts as an author, and conforming to the societal norm. Through that inner turmoil reflects the outside world she is living in, when she begins to fall in love with Thomas Sharpe, she has a chance at escaping all that her life has become and taking charge. However, her father puts a stop to that when he feels that something is not quite right between Edith and Thomas, being suspicious of him from before when mentioning the amount of times Thomas has reached out for help across various places.Edith eventually ends up going to Crimson Peak, unaware of its name at that time, previously having been advised from deceased mother to ""Beware of the Crimson Peak"".A large portion of the movie takes place within the house in Crimson Peak, where Lucille offers Edith some tea on a few occasions, we learn rather quickly to believe that something isn't right with the tea, and it is later revealed to be poisoned, a great display of Lucille's character. Showing that she is subtle in the way she deals with her problems but hinting that her toxicity is a deep flaw.Edith, slowly dying from the poison would begin to suspect the happenings at Crimson Peak with the interference and guidance of a few spirits, including that of Lucille and Thomas's mother.Thomas and Lucille plan to have Edith die once she has signed off a transfer deed, granting the Sharpes ownership over her estate, not longer having need of her afterwards.During this time, we learn of Thomas's multiple marriages and the fact that Lucille had been in a mental institution, furthering the ""something isn't right"" feeling.Up until around three quarters in to the movie, Thomas has been all for Lucille's plan and excited to go about this prospect once again, though now starts to feel suffocated by her presence in his life, wanting to leave that life all behind and start anew, having actually fallen in love with Edith. This advances Thomas's character and serves as a strong growth point for his character, showing a divide between the once perfect sibling couple. Lucille is unable to accept this information, and once Thomas burns the signed papers, Lucille lets her jealousy take control, killing her brother in a blind rage.With the final confrontation taking place outside of the house, Edith fights off Lucille, aided by the ghost of Thomas. Edith tells Lucille to turn around to look at her brother, Lucille doing so. Upon seeing the ghost of her brother, it is clear that her character has developed in her final moments. Having had either no guilt, or such little guilt over her previous murders, she was not able to see the ghosts within the house. Seeing the ghost of her brother shows that there is a guilt weighing on her now that was once not present, this being all Edith needed to get a final blow on Lucille, freeing herself from that nightmare.Returning to the beginning of the movie, it shows that a core plot point is that you never escape the ghosts of your past, only ignore for so long until they manifest, and you are unable to escape what has happened. Though this is portrayed differently with Edith and Lucille. Edith is able to learn from these past incidents and ghosts, allowing for her to survive where they had not, accepting the past and trying for a better future, whereas with Lucille, she is unable to move on from the past and these ghosts end up serving as a sign that her past has caught up to her, finally being too much for her to escape from.Overall the movie is extremely well directed, written, lit, designed, and acted out. The concept though simple was well executed and made for an entertaining and informative movie that I would highly recommend."

" Superior
",0.5423,0.8453,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Crimson peak is superior to the majority of mystery / ghost stories these days with their one dimensional jump scare recipe. Here you get the perfectly told Victorian/gothic fairy tale (gone wrong). The story might not be the most groundbreaking one, but that's fine. It's authentic, believable and most importantly, human. Love, hate, obsession, greed all this play a massive role in CP - the supernatural one is only a side note. Special call out to the Production design team. The overall vibe, buildings, costume, interior is nothing short of spectacular!"

" Ghost hunting in a maze of a family of heavy traumas
",-0.6705,0.7592,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"This is not bad for being an ordinary horror and ghost story, but there is actually an interesting point in it. Mia Wasikowska is a young beautiful daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur in America, but she has lost her mother and wants to get along in life by writing ghost stories. She has no success until a young handsome aristocrat comes across from England and seemingly falls in love with her, so he takes her along to his family estate in Cumberland, north England, a rather scary place suitable to Poe stories. here she gradually gets more and more like imprisoned at the mercy of Ton Middleston, her lawful wedded husband, baronet, and his sister, who is a cool piano player. However, they have some awful family secrets, and thus an endless horror nightmare begins with all kinds of atrocities, murders and bloodsheds and so forth, until an American doctor friend comes across who has suspected some nasty business, and he gets dragged into the mess of a horribly afflicted family. The film is marvellously well made, like all del Toro's films,. and a wonder to look at from beginning to end, the splendour constantly towering new visual wonders on top of all the previous ones, building up almost architecturally to a most impressive spectacle, while the sum of it all actually turns out to give her palpable evidence of that ghosts do exist in reality, which was her main object to prove from the start. But who will believe it?"
" Exactly right for a winter night, well shot and predictable

A very well imagined and contextualised film and all the better because you can act superior like, 'ooh, that costume is not quite 1891 more 1885', or, 'well that mechanical digger just would never work just look at the camshaft'. Setting all that aside, it was dark fun to watch and even includes human version of the Daffy Duck versus Bugs Bunny classic, namely the clanging whack to the head with a big long-handle shovel.

I've watched this work of art numerous times and it captivates me every time I think people dont get deltoros obsession with the macabre mixed with romance. He is obviously a romantic and yet knows the darkness as well. You can see his influence of mary Shelley and classic horror combined with his desire to achieve romance. The combination is magical, shape of water, pans labyrinth, the strain, all are so far beyond horror and in their own genre. We are soooooooo fortunate to have him making these works of art that'll stand the test of time!! Crimson peak is in it's own category therefore cant be defined, just enjoyed."
" A real shame...
",0.0,0.9916,2020-11-24 00:00:00,4,"I'm sometimes annoyed when people call films like Apostle boring because the first half is slow paced, but this film was dreadfully dull completely through. I have enjoyed most of Guillermo Del Toro's work. Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece, while the Devil's Backbone is clever ghost story and Cronos is an easy-to-watch fun movie. Hellboy II actually has a lot more to it than your standard action film. Sadly, this film cannot even surpass Pacific Rim in its campy fun. It was borderline unwatchable at a lot of points. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston seemed to be trying, but their characters were a drag to watch. Even the gore was unsatisfying. However, in fairness, once the revelation in the second half happens, it does get pretty funny to watch in a detached sort of way for a solid fifteen-twenty minutes, and Jessica Chastain does do a good job of at least being entertaining. If you like special effects, monsters or gore, those are the best parts of the film, but it's such a drag to get there. I think the only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 3 is that Guillermo directed it and I sort of see what he was going for.
However, you should watch literally any of his other movies, Pan's Labyrinth is his best movie, but the Devil's Backbone and Cronos are worth watching."
" Visually marvellous

I like Del Toro's style, I haven't seen a lot of films from him but from what I have seen I really enjoy. I love how he merges horror and fantasy to terrific results.
The film is very beautiful with some of the best costume design I have ever seen in a film, the sets are also gorgeus in particular the mansion in Crimson Peak and I also absolutely love the colours of the movie.
The acting is good although I don't think it stands out much and the story is very interesting even though the twist is predictable.

That's what I like about this one, not that I don't like modern time horror movies, which I do, but something about the 18th century makes it more cosy to watch alone in the dark.There is only one thing I don't like about this movie, actually it's a certain actress called (Jessica Michelle) although she does quite a chilling performance, I just don't like her as an actress,and a lot of people may say she is a good actress and all etc etc... but it doesn't work for me.Other than that the movie is perfect, and I know it's been five years since it's release but I still like as much as the first time, but that's the work of Guillermo del Toro...

Now a tender bride, she follows him to his native country, only in order to make one shocking discovery after another...""Crimson Peak"" may work - perhaps - as an homage or a pastiche of a certain genre, to wit the heavily Gothic horror, but it does not work as a legitimate representative of the genre. The reason is simple. A horror movie is supposed to induce a feeling of fear, but here everything is so familiar the viewer can predict the next development or the next twist from the comfort of his chair. Indeed, ""familiar"" is an understatement, since we're talking about a series of tropes and conventions a Jane Austen would have recognized. Consequently the movie becomes about as scare-inducing or disquieting as the menu of a Chinese takeaway restaurant. You KNOW the menu is going to list spring rolls, Peking duck and egg fried rice ; and yes, those are the exact same items printed on the piece of paper in front of you.I'm awarding the movie three stars, for its superb art direction, its magnificent effects, its outstanding props and locations and its dazzling costumes.

" ""You have nowhere else to go.""
",0.0,-0.9697,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"For students of cinematography, this is a stunningly filmed movie. The sets and costuming are gorgeous with a Gothic vibe, but it gets a bit surreal when the story moves to England with the marriage of Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). The open air roof of Allerdale Hall and the rotting floorboards would have been a pretty good indicator that the new bride just might have made a mistake. There's also more than just a bit of creepiness to the relationship between Thomas and sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain), and it wouldn't have surprised me if the story went in the direction of them being a married couple luring Edith into their web of deceit.The title of the picture derives from the red clay that Thomas is mining right outside his ancestral home, which turns winter snow a bright red that complements the horror inside the huge mansion. While the opening of the picture quickly reveals that it's going to be a ghost story, there's a bit more going on with the victims of the Sharpe's earlier conquests. I have to say though, the freakish looking creature that emanated from the floor of Allerdale would have sent the average person into a fit of hysterical screaming, but Edith took it in reasonable stride as one of the oddities of her new home. To me, she didn't seem to be all that panicked about it.The violence in the film picks up a considerable notch when Lucille pushes Edith over a second story balcony railing onto the snow covered living room floor (not a typo!), and from there, it becomes a knife fest to see who gets to be the last person standing. Lucille stabs the visiting Doctor Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), Edith stabs Lucille, Lucille in turn stabs her brother right in the face!, as Edith grabs a knife of her own, a little souvenir from ghost mom. Interestingly, Thomas winds up actually falling in love with his wife throughout the ordeal, and helps Edith kill his sister from the great beyond. All complemented by various shades of red as the story reaches it's ultimate bloody conclusion."

It was INCREDIBLY visually appealing, the colors , cinematography, costume design , casting, dialogue and overall feel we're on point .Plot wise , it wasn't meant to be scary, give cheap thrills or make you jump. It set out to be a time piece in which everything was supposed to look and feel as it would in the late 1800s, and it did . This was focused on the fact that the real ghosts in our lives are emotion, trauma and intuition and we need to learn to let some go and keep others with us.There are some BRUTAL scenes but they are placed well and used to add effect . It was a little predictable , but I don't think that's always a bad thing. It set out to be a story with a ghost (s)in it, but a ghost story and it did a great job of this and creating the incredible tension between all of the characters .I think this is one of his best and I would highly recommend it ."

It miraculously held my attention throughout the whole thing (a miracle on it's own since I'm ADHD), and had my heart racing several times. The cast did an amazing job, and the visuals were awe-inspiring. I watched it twice in one day, and enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Definitely one of my new favourites.

But I often find myself watching Horror movies that do romance so well and it makes me mad because you know they're likely going to die. So it's all wasted (not really, it makes you care even more for the characters so it hurts more when they die). That is how I felt with this movie. I love period films and this one is on my list of favorites now. And this period film really felt like a romance of it's period and I loved it and then the horror came it. Which was also amazing. It was creepy without having to constantly jumps care you (it had a one or two but that's fine). It is a slow burn movie, but it's also about two hours long, so I'm not sure if you could call it a slow burn. In any case, if you like period films with unsettling ghost (that look like how people in the Edwardian era would think of ghost) and a bit romance drama then you'll love this film. However, it can be a bit gory at certain parts."

" Visually vibrant but plodding & predictable Victorian-era film
",0.296,0.8715,2020-08-30 00:00:00,3,"As I've gotten older, I usually prefer the classic films from the 30's-60's decades. However, I subscribed to a 30-day free trial offer for Cinemax and thought this film looked intriguing, especially since I am a fan of Tom Hiddleston.First off, there was no convincing chemistry between any of the three leads, and the incestuous relationship between the brother and sister was telegraphed with their first glance. The film would have been much more effective and surprising concerning this main plot element if they had acted more like a restrained brother and sister of this particular period of time.In addition, I found the film confusing and plodding as well and the use of gory violence unnecessary. The ghosts' actions also made no sense and didn't add to the film's progression, and neither did the corpse in the ""bloody"" vat in the lower level. The liquid's color, though graphically vivid, looked neither like blood nor like red clay. The film's violence was just too over-the-top for me. I watch too few ""horror"" films nowadays and that is why I will go back to my old standards like ""The Innocents"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" with the handsome and charming Ray Milland. A film's horror/scare factor can be just as effective in black and white and with minimal, well-placed use of screeching and screaming. It's a shame that filmmakers (of any era) capitalize on all of the gore and violence. Give me the b/w cinematography from the first half of the 20th century any film-viewing day over the gut-wrenching violence and gore vomited on film lovers in the past few decades.My three stars are for: 1. the cinematography, 2. the costumes, and 3. the tiny dog's light-hearted presence and barking that added relief from the film's excessive, graphic violence and the irritating shrieking of the ghosts."
" Enchanting, eerie and enjoyable
",0.1027,0.9931,2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"I had no expectations going into this movie, but came away loving it. It's rare for a movie to hold my focus for the full run time, but Crimson Peak did. Visually, it's a cinematic masterpiece; so stunning, haunting and artistic. The story is more complex than I expected and although most viewers will predict where it's headed about half way through, there are still twists and turns that kept me on my toes. It's not a cheap horror which relies on jump scares or gore, it's a true gothic horror - the suspense is subtle and built into the atmosphere and setting throughout the movie. There are times where you're not quite sure who the bad guys and good guys are, and even when you think you know exactly how it's going to end, you still question your judgement. The cast were brilliant and all gave great performances. I was genuinely invested in Edith and in a strange way, even the romance between her and Thomas. Overall, I liked everything about Crimson Peak. It's a movie I'd watch over and over and still love it every time."
" Simple plot but worth a watch
",0.3291,0.9574,2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"Whilst it does have its problems, I would recommend watching it and forming your own opinion if you're on the fence about this movie. It wasn't scary for me, but it was creepy. The horror is peppered throughout so didn't become stale, but I also didn't feel starved of it.
I would recommend if you like the idea, just don't watch it expecting a ghost story, it just has ghosts in it.Crimson Peak is a spooky movie about a woman (Edith) who falls in love with a mysterious man (Thomas) who is trying to restore his mining business. Thomas has a dilapidated family home which is sinking into his clay mine.Plot-
The start of the movie was its weakest point in my opinion. Thomas' appearance felt forced to begin with but in retrospect fitted with the story. I'm not a fan of lengthy time skips (few days or maybe a month) and the start of this movie had a few. This led to the romance between Thomas and Edith mostly happening offscreen and felt rushed. Once the characters arrived at Thomas' house (crimson peak) my enjoyment of the movie skyrocketed.I personally thought that the plot was quite simple, which isn't necessarily a problem but I was left wanting to see more of the house and the characters could've been explored further, especially Thomas. There was a good explanation for the ghosts but it was done at the wrong time and this is my least favourite part of the movie and what I think is the weakest scene.Cinematography-
The way this movie looks is excellent. It's gorgeous. The only criticism I have is the weak CGI. It's not terrible, but I could tell it was CGI.Length-
I thought that it was an enjoyable length for me and it didn't outstay its welcome, just a shame it left me wanting more.Immersion-
For me, what went on was believable in the context of the movie (or depending on your beliefs regarding ghosts.) The time skips at the start hurt my ability to get really immersed, but I never looked at my watch.Soundtrack-
The music was fine and wasn't distracting. None of the tracks apart from the main theme really stood out to me.Would I watch it again-
Yes, I plan on watching it again."
" This came as a surprise.
",0.2732,0.92,2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Crimson Peak was recommended as a horror, and whilst there are a few horror tones throughout, I would say this is more in the psychological thriller bracket.It is a wonderfully lavish film, it looks fantastic, gorgeous costumes, sets and of course that exquisite building. The story is gripping, and will have you enthralled, you have no way which way it's going to turn out. Some decent special effects for the time.Hiddleston and cast are terrific, the acting is of the highest order, and elevates the story.Very gothic, very good, 8/10."
" ... and I generally like del Toro ...
",0.3612,0.9532,2020-07-20 00:00:00,5,"I feel I am in a real minority here -- there are critics I respect who think highly of this movies.I did not. It's possible some of my reaction could have been a case of ""wrong film at the wrong time,"" but even though I was happy to accept this as a ""fantasy"" of sorts, I found myself yelling at the the screen (of my laptop, that is) because of the sheer style-over-substance-ness of it all.Somehow, the Sharpe family's penury manifesting as a 20-30' foot hole in the roof through which leaves (and then snow) can oh-so-picturesquely cascade in a column throughout the film was too ""I'm just doing this for the shot"" for me. And that example is multiplied for the length of the film.The leads are physically attractive, and they show that they can mimic some extremities of emotion -- but in the end, do you know these people at all and do you care what happens to them? I didn't.YMMV.Del Toro has huge talent, but for me this was an enormous misfire. It's all spectacle."
" a story with ghosts
",0.0,0.9353,2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Any film made by Guillermo del Toro has a visual style that makes it recognizable at a glance, whether it's a sequence or a 'still' photo taken from the film. 'Crimson Peak ' made in 2015 is an excellent example, being perhaps the most 'del Toro' of del Toro's films. From the point of view of fantasy and visual imagination, the film is excellently designed, which makes it far exceed the average level of vintage horror films. In del Toro's filmography, however, this film is not one of his top films. The reason may be that by placing the story in the genre of movies in which ghosts and their relationships with humans play a key role in the action, the director (also a co-author of the script) seems to have borrowed and made the most of all the set effects, but works too little to the supernatural element. Those who see the film will find that the ghosts show up in copious quantities and in impressive appearances, but do not play an important role in the action. To paraphrase a dialogue in the film, it is a story with ghosts, but not a ghost story.The story begins in the New England of the first years of the 20th century where young heiress and socialite Lucille Sharp (Mia Wasikowska) falls in love with a young Brit inventor Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) which his father believes to be the wrong man for her. When his father dies a violent death nothing can prevent any longer Lucille to Marry Thomas and move with him and his piano playing sister (Jessica Chastain) to England. Their location is a remote mansion which seems to have witnessed plenty of atrocities that may not be over actually, a fact that the which the ghost-communicating American young woman (did I mention that she has the talent to speak with ghosts?) will face soon. Soon we will be together with the heroes in the middle of a Gothic horror movie.I have already written about the visual qualities of the film. Guillermo del Toro invented a cinematic world in his films in which people coexist with ghost, spirits and strabfe life forms, in which water and retro technologies play a significant role, in which red is a counterpoint to white, and black and shadows have thousands of different shades. The director directs his actors with professionalism and controls them with precision, completely erasing almost any trace of their personality, melting them into masterfully designed costumes and the extreme feelings of the heroes. We were in a gloomy and violent fairy tale, with a somewhat predictable outcome. With an extra touch of inventiveness and creativity, 'Crimson Peak ' could have been a memorable film."
" The Brits outshine the Americans on every level
",0.0,0.9897,2020-07-03 00:00:00,9,"This film has incredible gore sequences, the sink scene in particular is a very amazing sight. I think the characters were realistic, especially as they tended to have a lot of characteristics people from their countries tend to have. The main character for example was an overly ambitious author stuck in a fairy tale magical land of her imagination and her father had no ambition or recognised any great potential when he saw something unless it was similar to an invention that already exists, which is very American I feel as Americans don't tend to have much creativity compared to Brits.I also thought the ghost of the main character's mother was very sexy because she was a lovely white woman, to me it doesn't matter how decayed or old a white woman gets, she'll always be beautiful in my eyes so yes her mother's ghost was a very good treat for my love sack.I also think Thomas' sister is arguably the sexiest character ever so I can see how her and her brother ended up having the relationship they did. The Brits in this film, Thomas and his sister really did put the Americans in their place and outshone them on every level, Thomas Sharpe was a very complex highly intelligent character which paid a tribute to the British gentleman of the 19th Century and whilst he has a lot of ambition, unlike the main character he knows the limits of his ambition and doesn't let his ambition drive him insane or to a fictional world which only exists in his mind.My only disappointment in this film was that I wanted Thomas and his sister to hug each other and look after one another in the final scene of this film to show that they live happily ever after, as I feel those two characters were born for each other."
" Gothic Horror
",-0.5719,0.9352,2020-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Not action horror.I'm not sure about other countries, but trailers here made this movie look like a slasher, fast, action horror when really it was closer to a Gothic romance one. I think the movie suffered from miss-marketing and people went in thinking this was something it's not.The sets, costumes and ghosts were all beautifully designed. I'd expect nothing less from Guillermo del Toro though.The characters were interesting and I want to especially emphasize how much I loved Jessica Chastain in this. She did so well in making her character as eerie to watch as possible, like you know there's more to her there.
She was legit scary at the start, without needing a hockey mask and a machete.The story was engaging, even if other's might think it would be too slow, I felt like I was on the edge of my seat, trying to piece together the puzzle on what's going on in that mansion.As someone who's tired of the jumpscare-riddled, overly gory and big chested, screaming ""high schooler"" horror movies out there, this one was a big win in my books and a breath of fresh air."

Sure, it spends some time establishing the characters and set up to the marriage and move to the house, but this isn't at the expense of any horror or scariness. There was ample time for the dramatic climax, which was a little bloody but quite balanced compared to some.
I suppose the plot was a little predictable but still enjoyable.
Overall, excellent aesthetics, great acting and plot."
" Bland and unoriginal
",0.0,0.2311,2020-05-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie didn't work for me, the pacing is really bad and the story is like plain boring. The whole plot is predictable from the start, like the first time Tom Hiddelston is introduced you know what's going on and how it will end. There was a bathtub scene from The Shining which didn't really amaze me, although the visuals in this movie are great. The second half of the movie is actually much better than the first but it's still uninteresting and poorly written."
" A story with ghosts in it.
",0.0,0.9714,2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Guillermo Del Toro is the master of making movie violence feel shocking and painful, often pushing the boundaries of genre (and rating) to deliver moments that genuinely make you wince. 'Crimson Peak (2015)', a lavish ode to gothic horror that owes a huge debt to films such as 'The Haunting (1963)' and 'The Innocents (1961)', is peppered with such moments. Though it plays with themes often seen in the famous director's work, the piece puts its self together as a competent, confident and compelling story about love and monsters. Of course, the thing isn't about ghosts, even though it has plenty of ghosts in it. Perhaps this abundance is its weakest aspect, actually; the hellishly red spectres that haunt its eponymous family home are almost too overt for their own good, juxtaposing the otherwise restrained vibe of the horror and creeping incredibly closely to the realm of 'cartoon'. Nevertheless, the narrative is effective and the scare sequences are well-crafted. An unconventional pacing lets you know immediately that the plot revolves around its protagonist, not just the ghostly goings-on she unwittingly gets involved with. The performances are all great, even when they aren't all that spectacular. Hiddleston, especially, is impressive in his surprisingly layered role, carrying the weight of a lot of the affair's late-game twists and their nuances. The twists themselves all feel natural and a few are actually surprising. There's a good amount of foreshadowing and a back-and-forth dynamic that keeps you on your toes. Overall, the flick is great. Amidst its beautifully desolate set-design is an intriguing, almost atypical story that feels decidedly - and delightfully - old school. 8/10"
" A Great Gothic Horror
",0.1027,0.9941,2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Overall this was a very entertaining, dark, somewhat mysterious Gothic horror film. I loved the period that the movie is set in as I'm a big fan of Victorian era fashion, technology and culture. The scenery was very good thanks to the amazing setting the film was in, the snow surrounding the Sharpe's large house in the middle of nowhere made the film even more dark but at the same time more beautiful and memorable.Plot Complexity: 15/20 - A lot of quotes Thomas Shape says are very thought provoking, such as the way he tells the protagonist she's childish and consumed by unrealistic childish dreams, it makes me wonder what he said there was true or whether it was simply his way of dumping her because of her father so even after watching this movie there are still some nice interesting questions to carefully think about after watching. The way Thomas' sister gets evidently jealous when he dances with the protagonist in the beginning was quite interesting as it shows his sister isn't content with their relationship being sexual every now and then, for her their relationship MUST be sexual all the time.Characters: 8/10 - I felt each character in this movie had some personality to them, even the protagonist to a certain extent though she was a very stereotypical Female character in many ways.Thomas Sharpe was easily the most interesting character as he had the most interesting thought provoking quotes, was the smartest character and had a lot of knowledge which made his quotes generally very interesting for history enthusiasts such as myself as well as giving the character a more broad range of things to say as a result of his vast knowledge. Tom Hiddleston's acting was top notch and the film did a great job of making it difficult for the viewer to decide whether to support Thomas or the protagonists father during their few scenes they have together.Emotion (not including laughs): 8/10 - The film had many emotional scenes such as the protagonist's father's death, Thomas' death and Thomas' dumping of the protagonist, the dance scene as well as the sex scene between Thomas and the protagonist.Consistency: 10/10 - No boring scenes in my opinion, overall a very entertaining film from start to finish, you probably won't long to watch anything else when you're watching this movie for the first time.Scare Factor: 5.5/10
Sex Factor: 6/10
Laugh Factor: 1/10"

" Stunning imagery let down by poor talent...
",-0.128,-0.1556,2020-04-20 00:00:00,6,"This is a gorgeous looking film with some superb Gothic-style settings and detail. The premiss is that of a scheming inventor (Tom Hiddleston) who approaches a wealthy American industrialist for funds to develop his mining machine. To no avail, but in the process the daughter (Mia Wasikowska) falls for him and when her father is brutally murdered she marries him and returns to his home complete with his own version of ""Mrs. Danvers"" (Jessica Chastain). Once there she discovers his manor house - complete with a huge great hole in the roof - is full of it's own grisly secrets. Is that really just the iron content in the water?? The suspense is much more subtle and cumulative; it isn't about banging doors or dodgy sound effects; the pace of the thing is compelling. The acting, however, is not. None of the three principals seem to gel; Charlie Hunnam appears totally uncomfortable as the doctor; the dialogue doesn't work anywhere near as well as the visuals and the Velázquez score underperforms disappointingly. Perhaps del Toro had to cast for box office rather than suitability for the roles - which is a shame; the whole thing could have been much better with a more talented trio in the leads."

" A Red Herrings Classic!
",0.0,-0.9271,2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,"As we've come to expect from a Guillermo del Toro film, Crimson Peak is nothing less than a visual feast. Luxuriant cinematography by Dan Laustsen, appropriate Gothic-inspired sets, sumptuous costumes and let it be said now, that del Toro knows how to light a set. In spite of the genre, with the setting largely confined to the traditional ""haunted mansion"" on the snowy moors of England, the audience is never expected to peer into expressionistic gloom and try and guess what's happening. Everything is seen with abundant character and clarity.The acting too is first class with especially great work from the two female leads in Mia Wasikowska as the heroine Edith, who is in close to 90% of the scenes and Jessica Chastain as her chief antagonist Lucille, who is required to play a progressively threatening and more domineering role as the storyline moves forward. Tom Hiddleston is more than competent as money-seeking British knight with secrets Sir Thomas, who is seen less in the second half of the film, as his sister Lucille grows in prominence. And Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver are not short-changed, when it comes to the writing of their support characters.Guillermo del Toro has not tried to hide the fact publicly that Crimson Peak tries to avoid the modern pattern of creating shocks and cheap thrills, by the use of multiple jump scares and sudden loud noises. This is clearly a film paying homage to classics such as The Innocents, whereby suspense is created through the development of a brooding, increasingly threatening atmosphere.However it's clearly not a spoiler to state that this is a ghost movie and therefore the vast majority of scares we encounter in the first two acts are created by the emergence of rather horrid, terrifying CGI spectral creations who appear to frequently intimidate and frighten poor Edith. But in a shaggy dog third act twist, it becomes bleedingly obvious that these ghosts are actually supposed to be ""good"" and sympathetic to Edith's forbidding plight. So then we are left wondering why earlier, they felt they had to scare the crap out of her to get their message across, when we see the white ghost of Tom, looking and behaving completely differently. It's just not a consistent approach and we are left feeling that we've been conned by the cinematic equivalent of a pea and thimble trick to maintain suspense levels.Crimson Peak is a worthwhile addition to the ghost movie genre, but would arguably have been far more memorable, had it adopted a more consistent, less contrived approach with the use of its supernatural elements. I give it a 6.5/10, which is exactly its IMDB rating at time of writing and virtually the same as its Meta-critic rating. I think that's a very apt number and kind of wish I didn't have to round it up to 7."

Now married to Thomas, Edith must leave behind her family estate in Buffalo and head to the Allerdale Hall in England, an age old and secluded mansion standing tall amid red soil. Much as Thomas and his sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastaine) have fancy titles, Edith soon discovers that the family is actually broke and is looking for money to fund a mining project in the estate. She will also discover that the three of them are not the only inhabitants of the mansion, but there are ghosts creeping out of hone woodwork, trying to tell her about a sinister and morbid past and a terrifying plot hatching. The movie is downright eerie and sends shivers down the spine in the beginning, but the horror doesn't hold for long as it transforms into a suspenseful narrative in due course. No love lost - the tale is gripping enough for the viewers to remain at the edge of the seat until the very end when the mystery falls in place. The frigid mansion, the snowstorm outside, the mysterious characters and a-chill-a-minute storytelling are worth every pence.

Somehow the story is humdrum as I expected more from it. You sense all the things that inspired this film and yet it is inert. There is no substance just like the foundations of the mansion."

" Beware Of Crimson Peak
",0.0,-0.961,2019-10-01 00:00:00,8,"Crimson Peak is a Gothic tale from director Gullermo Del Toro. This movie is so much better than I thought, in fact I loved it. The story includes ghosts, murder, deceit, and incest, making it one of the best horror/suspense movies I have seen. So here is a little about the movie, and yes my reviews are detailed. So I hope this review is helpful to you?As a young child, Edith Cushing( Mia Wasikoloski) lost her mother to Black Coloria. Edith is raised by her father, Carter Cushing( Jim Beaver). He is a successful wealthy builder in New York. Looking back Edith would remember those nightly visits from her mother's spirit as a child. She would come into Edith's room waking her; and warn Edith about Crimson Peak. It is 1901, Edith is now a successful author in Buffalo; N.Y.. She visits her father and is still very close to her childhood friend; Dr. Alan Mc Michael. Alan is Carter's Physician and really likes Edith. One day Carter is hoping the two will marry. Edith is viewed differently from some of the other women, especially Alan's mother. One day while at work, Baronet Thomas Sharpe( Tom Hiddleston) has an appointment with Carter Cushing. At first, Edith is not impressed with him; because his title says it all. A Baronet is a rich sponge who lives off other people. Thomas has also bought along his sister Lucille Sharpe( Jessica Chastain). Lucille is a piece of work she is very cold to others, and very possessive of her brother. The two are both from Cumberland, England and have been left an estate at Allerdale Hall.When Thomas meets Carter for the first time, Carter doesn't like him one bit. Thomas has come to seeking money from Carter, for his production of clay that is produced on his property. Thomas explains that it is the richest and reddest ever on the planet, hence the name CRIMSON PEAK. In order to keep producing more he needs money for more clay harvesters. Now, Carter knows that Thomas has failed to raise capital in London, Scotland, and Italy. Now in New York, Carter is not buying the story; and asks Alan what he thinks about him? Alan believes he should get, Finlay, an investigator to find some more info on the two. Finlay comes back with the results a couple days later, and Carter knew the two were up to something. The results show the two are penniless sponges. Who prey on primarily on wealthy women.That night there's a ball at Carter's residence, and invites the two siblings. Afterwards he asks to see the two in his den. He tells them he had them checked out and knows there game. Then he pays them off and tells the two to leave Buffalo A.S.A.P.. He especially tells Thomas to have no further contact with with his daughter. The next day Carter is preparing for the day at his club. He hears someone in the bathroom and goes to look around. He can't find anyone, so he returns to finish up. All of a sudden he is blindsided; and beaten to death.After her father's death Thomas contacts her telling her what happened about the payoff and proposes marriage to her. When Edith decides this is best for her, she returns to Allerdale Hall as his wife. She has no idea that he is already married. When she sees this so called estate, she is floored. It's a wreck, the roof is in need of repair, the house sinks into the ground due to the clay; and the two really can't afford to keep it up. She walks around and the first thing she sees is an image of a woman, she tells Thomas; but he says it's Lucille.Thomas tells Lucille and the two start to worry. When it keeps happening, the images become darker; and more grotesque. She finally asks Thomas if anyone has died in the house. He brushes it off and explains to her sure the house is very old.When she meets Lucille and has a chance to really talk to her, she realizes Lucille is very cold towards her. When Edith asks for keys to the house, Lucille refuses. She explains the house is very old, and some places are too dangerous right now. Lucille has plans for Edith, she starts poisoning her tea, she is now their prisoner. She is only their so they can steal her money.Back in Buffalo, Allen talks with Carter's lawyer. He tells Allen Edith has transferred all her assets to Cumberland, England. Allan is shocked when he hears this, and talks to Finlay. Allen tells Finlay something isn't adding up, transferred assets, no communication, and the sudden marriage.When Alan meets with Finlay and gets the news. Finlay tells him that Thomas is already married to a Pamela Upton of Milan, Italy. When Alan hears this he knows Edith is in trouble, and goes to England to help her.While Edith is there, Lucille continues to be hateful to her; and Thomas is still his sister's puppet. Edith demands a key and will do anything to get one eventually stealing Lucille's one day. Even though Thomas is married he begins to fall in love with her. Edith continues to see these images of a ghost; and tells Thomas. Thomas and Lucille know she is seeing the image of their late mother, Lady Sharp(Dave Jones). The spirit seems to help Edith find clue's all over the house about the duo. When Edith wises up she begins to search the house and comes across this chest. It holds the secret of three women and their mother. These women who were wealthy were held captive until they signed over their assets to Thomas and Lucille Sharpe. It comes out they too were poisoned, robbed, and later killed-all for money.When Alan arrives at the Sharp's estate he tells Edith everything, even though she is suffering from being poisoned she does understand him. All their history,especially when the two were young and sent away. When Alan begins to take Edith home, Thomas inflicts a non-fatal wound to him. Then for the first time in his life Thomas stands up against his sister, confronts her, but she ends up killing him. Lucille then begins to track down Edith. The two fight to the death, when Edith hits her with a shovel, Thomas's ghost is there to help Edith. In the end, Edith and Allen escape from Crimson Peak. In Conclusion, this is a great tale that has it all even a great ending. An impressive piece of work with excellent visuals,plot, and acting was decent considering these actors were unknown to me."

I'm not a fan of horror, but this film is more than just cheap thrills riding on tides of gore and moments that make you jump. The story is well written, the plot twists are clever, the visuals are beautifully done and the characters are so empathetically portrayed they have you wanting to know their fate and feeling drawn into their world. Mia as Edith Cushing was a likeable hero and Tom Hiddleston was brilliant as Sir Thomas Sharpe, imparting to his character a sense of depth and complexity which really made this story work. I didn't give this a 10 because I'm simply not a fan of horror, but it saddens me to see the number of trolls posting incredibly negative reviews of this film for ""reasons"" that don't seem quite correct if you've actually seen it. One is left to presume this is similar to the attack on Captain Marvel, heavily trolled because the hero is female (thank goodness the Aliens movies achieved their popularity and reviews before this unfortunate rise of misogynist trolling).

The vibe it gives off is an ancient and gothic feeling which I really like. The house is very cool as well, majority of what happens in there is very interesting. The secrets revealed are also very good. However, I have a huge problem. If a horror movie doesn't scare you, what's the point? This plot isn't scary.

The spirits' design is also very stylish, however they struggle to inspire any real fear, and serve more as instruments to move the story forward.The editing is lacking, with quick cuts where there need to be ones and campy transitions that rukn the overall style of the film. The script is adequate, not anything to write home about but period appropriate, and carried by capable and adequate actors, who are able to portray the necessary melodrama even when it seems too much. The motivations are sometimes paper thin so don't try to think about them too much.Problems, however, emerge with the story. Paper thin and predictable from the very start, the story doesn't veer from cliché, and stays very typical for this kind of period drama. Actors act exactly as you expect them to, and when they don't it seems very forced and unnatural."

" THE ULTIMATE VERSION
",0.0,0.9985,2019-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I've been a fan of Guillermo del Toro for some time. I enjoyed MIMIC when some slammed it. I loved his following films like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, BLADE II, HELLBOY, PAN'S LABYRINTH and PACIFIC RIM. So when I heard he was going to turn his attentions to a ghost story I was primed. How could he fail? The fact is he couldn't and didn't. CRIMSON PEAK is one of the best ghost/haunted house films ever made and among my top 4 in the category.In 1887 Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), daughter of wealthy businessman Carter, is warned by the ghost of her mother to ""Beware of Crimson Peak"". Time passes and in 1901 she finds herself looking for work. At the same time she meets Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who has come to seek backers for his invention, a clay mining device. Along with Thomas is his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Edith soon falls for Thomas to the disapproval of both her father and her childhood friend Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam). So much so that he bribes Thomas to leave his daughter.But Thomas writes her a letter and the two marry. Before her father can disinherit her, he is brutally murdered. Grieving Edith accompanies her husband and sister-in-law to their home in England, Allerdale Hall. The mansion is falling to pieces, due in large part to the fact it is built on a huge deposit of red clay.As time passes Edith begins to see apparitions of various ghosts in the Hall. Lucille is cold to her and not the least bit welcoming. And Thomas has yet to consummate their marriage, too preoccupied with his invention. That changes on a night when they are snowed in and afterward Lucille flies into a rage. Edith begins to become ill shortly thereafter and as the snow falls she notices the entire location of the Hall has turned red outside. Thomas tells her that this is why some call the location ""Crimson Peak"", the red clay permeating the ground as it rises up and colors the snow red.The ghosts continue to plague Edith and more mysterious circumstances take place. Fearing for her safety Dr. McMichael has arrived in England to come to her aid. But will he arrive in time to save her from the various dangers the apparitions have warned her of? And just what is actually taking place in Allerdale Hall?The movie combines the best of ghost stories and haunted house tales to make a completely affecting film. Those involve not just the scary apparitions that appear to Edith but the entire make up of Allerdale Hall. Del Toro has given life not just to the participants of the story but to the entire location as well. The dilapidated state of the Hall, the crimson snow, the shadow filled hallways and twisting passages all work together to create and effective atmosphere that primes the viewer for what is taking place there.But the ghosts themselves are splendid as well. Once more del Toro uses actor Doug Jones to the best of his abilities to bring these manifestations of the undead to life. The combination of make-up and acting by Jones makes each of these creations believable and terribly frightening. When mixed with the location itself the movie provides the most effective ghost tale done in years.The entire cast deserves major credit for their performances here. Del Toro has brought out the best of each of them. Not one can be singled out among the rest. Each and every one of them does an amazing job. That they can come from the previous items they are known for and not once do you feel those past incarnations is a testament to their skills.But the movie came out in 2015 and the blu-ray has already been on the market since that time. So what reason would anyone have to buy a new copy of this? Well the obvious answer is that it's getting the Arrow Video treatment. If you don't know Arrow Video by now you're not aware of one of the best disc companies out there. Their releases provide the best version of any film they've released with plenty of extras on hand for those who enjoys them as well.Their version presents the film in hi-def blu-ray format. But it is the overabundance of extras that make this one special. Rarely do companies provide this much background on a release. The extras here include an audio commentary by co-writer/director del Toro, ""The House is Alive: Constructing Crimson Peak"" a feature length documentary on the making of the film, a previously unseen Spanish language interview with del Toro, ""The Gothic Corridor, The Scullery, The Red Clay Mines, The Limbo Fog Set"" four featurettes on the different aspects of Allerdale Hall, ""A Primer on Gothic Romance"" where the director talks about the specifics of Gothic romance, ""The Light and Dark of Crimson Peak"" in which the cast and crew discuss the use of color in the film, ""Hand Tailored Gothic"" a featurette on the costumes in the film. But we're just getting started. There is also ""A Living Thing"" a look at the design, modelling and construction of the Allerdale Hall sets, ""Beware of Crimson Peak"" a walking tour of Allerdale Hall with Tom Hiddleston, a look at CRIMSON PEAK and the tradition of Gothic romance by author and critic Kim Newman, ""Violence and Beauty in Guillermo del Toro's Gothic Fairy Tale Films"" a video essay by writer Kat Ellinger, deleted scenes, original trailers and TV spots, a double sided fold-out poster, four double-sided postcard sized lobby card reproductions, limited edition packaging with newly designed artwork by Guy Davis and a limited edition 80 page hard bound book featuring writing by David Jenkins and Simon Abrams, an archival interview with del Toro and original concept design illustrations by artists Guy Davis and Oscar Chichoni. It's almost as if watching this entire offering from Arrow will turn into less a movie viewing and more a binge watching weekend.I can tell you now if you hadn't already realized that I loved this movie. I watched it again about 2 months ago but when this version arrived I didn't feel obligated to watch it again I wanted to watch it again. And it was well worth it. And there is no doubt in my mind that I will revisit it again and again. If you've not seen it then by all means make a point of doing so. And if you've seen it in the past and loved it then make a point of picking up this version of it, if not for the extras then for the film itself. Why? Because Arrow Video has done it right and done it well. That alone should be a reason in itself."
" It was disappointing had alot of jumpscares but did not live to it's hype
",-0.2732,-0.9814,2019-01-12 00:00:00,6,Guillermo del tero ah yes the same guy who made films like pans labyrinth (2006) and mimic (1997) the many problems with Crimsion peak was that it had alot of benefit it had a high budget the film follows a girl in the 1800s who after she moves into a big mansion but is later haunted by demonic ghost many critics panned the film like plugged in which are some of the worst critics of all time but what makes Crimsion peak disappointing was that it was very slow and boring it was sort of scary it had alot jumpscares but was poorly written and poorly slow and boring another thing was that it was it had a high budget the mansions were rich and dark or gloomy and the dresses reminded me of the 1800s clothing though it was dark at the end where the girl actually dies (spoiler alert). Though you can watch it though be warned on how boring it was you might like it but I can't get into it
" A flop plot
",-0.34,-0.1823,2019-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Not scary, poor acting (with the obvious exception of Jessica), awful plot and saw most if it coming miles away. The only part it made me frightened was because I was watching a recorded box version and when it finished and I turned it to direct TV it was starting again."
" Not what I expected but I've come to appreciate it
",0.5499,0.986,2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Guillermo del Toro's ""Crimson Peak"" is very much a throwback to a bygone era of horror fiction. At first glance, the movie appears to be a standard haunted house tale like countless others that we've seen through the years. However, upon closer inspection the story's true inspiration turns out to be the archetypal gothic romances that laid the foundation for much of the horror fiction that has since followed. Successful examples of this approach in Hollywood are few and far between, with the likes of ""Rebecca"" (1940) & ""Dragonwyck"" (1946) being among the few that spring to mind.To be sure, there are indeed horrific elements in ""Crimson Peak"" but I would hesitate to classify it as an out-and-out horror movie. del Toro is obviously familiar with the basic ingredients of a gothic romance and he wields them expertly in crafting his own story. While you might have a point in saying that that the formula is extremely derivative, it is nevertheless a formula that works. It basically wouldn't be gothic romance without a vulnerable heroine, a dashing but mysterious suitor and an ancestral home whose hauntings are both literal and figurative.Given the somewhat rigid guidelines of gothic romance, del Toro's script is actually more intricate than it might seem at first. The movie is full of metaphors, many of them visual. This imbues life into material whose presentation could have been routine in the hands of another director. In particular, the use of colour in the film is especially striking.Of course, a script like this needs actors/actresses who are up to the task of bringing it to life. Mia Wasikowska is suitably delicate for the role of the young lady who becomes ensnared in a perilous situation. Tom Hiddleston & Jessica Chastain have the juiciest roles and neither of them disappoint in supplying an air of subtle menace. Charlie Hunnam's performance is a bit below these three in my estimation but he still makes a serviceable counterpoint to Hiddleston. The supporting cast is similarly satisfactory but ultimately nothing to write home about.del Toro's direction is well handled, as always. The beautiful visuals do not come at the expense of generating & sustaining suspense. The visual effects are a bit too grotesque for my taste but others may feel differently. The sets & costumes are also exquisite. Overall, the movie shows meticulous attention to detail in virtually every area of the production.All of that being said, ""Crimson Peak"" definitely isn't a movie for everyone. If you're looking for horror then you might not find enough of it. If you're looking for romance then you might be turned off by the horrific trappings. To be honest, while I admired del Toro's craft the first time I watched this movie, the story felt a bit weak. It was only upon rewatching it that I was able to appreciate the intricacies of the presentation and appreciate it for what it is rather than what I initially expected it to be."
" A good psychological horror film.
",-0.2023,0.9832,2018-12-30 00:00:00,8,"This movie is really good. Set in the late 19th century, the psychological horror film bet heavily on building a scary environment. The time chosen helps: it is the time of long dresses, Victorian superstitions, neo-Gothic houses full of shadows and sullen, gloomy appearance. All thought to detail, as usually happens when we have Guillermo del Toro at the helm.The story is simple: a young American, daughter of a wealthy capitalist, engages with a poor but stout British aristocrat in search of funding to revive his family's centuries-old clay mines. However, her father is against and decides to scare away the Englishman and his dark sister, dying soon after, very conveniently for them. Thus, a few months later, the young woman is on English soil, married and living in a dark and shattered house. There are hidden dark secrets that she will gradually discover ... and that will reveal the true face of her new husband.Okay, let's first look at the problems: the script is pretty solid but it has a blazing hole: the stupid idea of making a very expensive machine to extract clay which, it seems, is so surface that it even threatens the structural stability of the house built in top. It is something that even during the film leaves anyone to think and I do not know how del Toro, a usually detailing director, let this fault escape. On the other hand, the scares are quite predictable and, at least I did not feel so scared. I like it, the movie shudders, it causes chills, and there's enough blood and gore for audiences who are looking for this sort of thing, which is not really my case, but it was not that movie that made me afraid to turn out the light in the room .Mia Wasikowska was perfect for her character. She knew how to be sweet and fragile while being brave and reacting to danger. At times, she knew how to look like a damsel in distress, but in others she was stronger than any man in the cast. Tom Hiddleston did his part quite well, revealing doubts about his own feelings. In the background, his character is quite fragile psychologically. More powerful and dominant is Jessica Chastain, an actress full of strength who has mastered the film.Technically, the film surprises by the highly elaborate scenarios and by the decadent and grandiose mansion, where everything happens. The blood-red color of that substance that in the film is clay also helps, along with snow white, to make the film visually more impressive. The good construction of the scenes combines harmoniously with a somber cinematography, but not enough to remove color brilliance."
" A ghotic Ghost Story
",-0.3182,0.9941,2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"First of all, this is not a ghost story, but a story of ghosts. If you are looking for some pure horror movie, something like Insidious, then this is not it, although you will jump from your seat at some point, which is always welcome!Best thing about this movie is the visual sight of it all, the sets, the house, the wardrobe! Everything has been taken care up to the littlest detail ever! It is like a gothic fairytale, but instead of fairies you will find some ghost wandering around at some point in the story... The house, for example, is soo big and there are so many things in it that you might start thinking, really? Why is this like that?All characters are really well-played by their actors and actresses but Personally, I loved Jessica Chastain's performance. She is really terrific in her role as the sinister sister; since the moment she appears, she simply takes the show home. Absolutely fantastic she is! (She should take more roles like this!)This is above all a Guillermo del Toro's movie and you can feel his touch in it and if you like his movie this one won't disappoint you. Just go and enjoy it!Bonus: At some point in the movie a friend of mine shouted: ""That's Batman!!"". Which I found really hilarious because I was like: ""That's a ninja!!"".

" A very mixed bag
",0.0,0.9288,2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,"If you were to task both critics and general audiences with naming their favourite active directors, I would place a bet on Guillermo del Toro being the first name on the lips of many. The Mexican monster-lover has the unique ability to juggle both passion projects that clearly mean a lot to the filmmaker, and large-scale blockbusters to appease the studios, and this one-for-me, one-for-you approach has allowed to him to bring to the screen some incredibly personal stories which would have otherwise been left to linger in the director's imagination. So for every The Devil's Backbone, we got a Hellboy, and for every Pan's Labyrinth, we got a Pacific Rim. 2015's Crimson Peak was del Toro's first attempt at blending these two styles. Movie lovers could admire the breathtaking visuals and attention to detail, while the general audience could enjoy a juicy gothic mystery featuring some of the industry's most attractive stars. The result is a very mixed bag.In turn-of-the-century New York, heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) dreams of becoming an author, but finds herself dissuaded at every turn by the men holding the power. Her father, wealthy businessman Carter (Jim Beaver), is visited by English travelling salesman Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who is seeking investment for his clay-mining machinery. The dashing bachelor is shut down by Carter, but catches the eye of Edith, and two begin a romantic affair. When Carter dies, Edith marries Thomas and travels to his home Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, a decaying mansion dubbed 'Crimson Peak' due to the red clay oozing up from the ground. Joining them will be Thomas' ice-cold sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain), who seems to harbour a resentment for her brother's new wife. But Crimson Peak has stories to tell, and Edith's unexplained connection to the spirit world means that she is frequently visited by hideous tormented ghosts carrying warnings. Back in the U.S., former suitor Dr. McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) is conducting his own research into the Sharpes and their shady history.Del Toro has always excelled at building tangible worlds which seem to live and breath alongside the characters, and the rotting interiors of Allerdale Hall is one of the director's greatest achievements. Lush with exquisite detail, the house pulses with menace, tormenting Edith with locked doors and taps that spurt red before running clear. There's even a hole in the ceiling that allows snow to gather at the bottom of the main staircase, and the splashes of bold colour evoke the likes of Mario Bava, Dario Argento and Hammer. It's a feast for the senses, and it's just enough to distract from the mediocrity of the main story and the inclusion of CGI spectres. The mystery unravels quite beautifully, but the problem is that you'll already be two or three steps ahead. Nothing that happens in Crimson Peak will come as a surprise, especially after you've quickly realised that anyone with an English accent can't be trusted. The film loses its physicality somewhat when attempting to deliver the scares, as twisted ghosts crawl and squeal their way towards Edith. Computer-generated apparitions will never be scary, and Crimson Peak packs way more impact when catching you off guard with moments of extreme violence that will make you wince and cry out without averting your gaze. Rank this somewhere above Pacific Rim and below Hellboy II."
" In Which We Paint the House Red
",0.0,0.9904,2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"There's a term in film studies, the ""auteur theory."" It's to film directors what a modus operandi is to criminals: a distinct way of doing things that readily identifies a work as theirs. One of the best modern examples is Guillermo del Toro. Even in commercial fare like the ""Hellboy"" series and ""Pacific Rim,"" there's a giddiness and fascination with the bizarre and grotesque you won't find from any other director. The only one who comes close is probably David Cronenberg, yet where he is more of a cold observer, del Toro is clearly having the time of his life. Which is why ""Crimson Peak,"" a film I saw for the first time last night, was a bit of a disappointment.To be fair, this is not a horror film. Del Toro considers it a gothic romance, and despite his usual trademarks - insect imagery, unique creatures, religious symbolism - there's very little to actually fear in ""Crimson Peak."" And that's fine - del Toro is so skilled a director it's exciting to see him branch out as he did with ""Hellboy"" and ""Pacific Rim."" However, he holds onto his most cherished genre just enough that I couldn't help but feel something was missing.It is not the visuals - Dan Laustsen, filling in for regular del Toro cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, is just as consummate a stylist, and the house is arguably the most eerily beautiful set of all his creations. I do wish, though, that the editing had been a little less choppy - it threw off the pacing of several scenes and made the film, even at two hours, feel rushed at times. Not the acting, either - while Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam were a bit stiffer than I expected, Mia Wasikowska is compelling, while Jessica Chastain outshines everyone. It has all the ingredients required for a good creepy romp. So what, then?Perhaps this - one of the greatest strengths of any given del Toro film is not just the visuals but the inventiveness. Unless you're totally in tune with his sensibilities, you can't possibly predict what insane thing will happen next. There's not much of that here. Except for one late twist, the story is surprisingly simple, and at one point I felt as if I were waiting for the characters to catch up. Again, this being a homage to a bygone era of filmmaking, it's understandable, but in terms of plot and tone I surprised myself by thinking this was del Toro going through the motions. The ghost story itself is strangely rote, the human drama melodramatic but ultimately unremarkable. Perhaps the most egregious moment was a sex scene between two relatively normal adults. I mean, come on! What is healthy, conventional sex doing in a Guillermo del Toro movie? Where are the fish men and their hidden appendages?Okay, I kid. I don't believe it's possible for del Toro to make a truly bad film, or at least one not worth watching. He's a visual genius, and his basic concepts are almost always refreshingly original, even when riffing on old genre tropes. Here, though, seems to be an instance when his eccentricities aren't equaled by the plot they are in service of. Still, even conventional del Toro shows more ingenuity and genuine enthusiasm than the vast majority of Hollywood, and for this reason Crimson Peak is still well worth seeing. Just don't expect to be in as much awe as you're used to."

" What a Waste of Acting Talent
",0.0,-0.5973,2018-10-07 00:00:00,5,"There is some really good acting in an otherwise horrible script. Yes the sets and costumes were amazing. Jessica Chastain was brilliant as the possessive sister of Tom Hiddleston's Thomas Sharpe. But she had some awesomely tough plot turns that worked against her. She had so little good dialogue to work with. There is absolutely no way even someone as stupid as the Edith Cushing character (Mia Wasikowska) is going to sign away her wealth, at that particular point in the movie. Why did Del Toro even think that was going to work? Maybe he was trying to emphasize the psychological horror of Edith's predicament. I wondered why have the story even go there? Learning not to drink the tea is one thing (we got it: Rosemary's Baby), but to then go ahead and eat the porridge when we all know that's poisoned too. It's just too obvious. And then to have to work with the plot device of having Lucille leave the rest of her keys on the tea tray, knowing that Edith stole one, was too much for me to believe. I kept losing my suspension of disbelief over and over and having to find it again to get back into the movie. Very distracting. He also chose two completely wooden actors to play the sympathetic leads. I don't think Wasikowska knew at all how to make Edith believable. Charlie Hunnam as Dr. Alan was marginably better. For me, the violence overshadowed any subleties and interesting philosophical questions Del Toro might have raised. The final two lines, ""Ghosts? They never go away,"" were intriguing. But the questions that could be inspired by the last assertion were not in the least way explored in the movie. It is a waste of a final statement. I came away thinking, Huh? What exactly happened in this movie? Why did it happen? Do I care about Edith? She's stupid and careless. And she's freakishly strong for a woman on death's door. This was a gorgeous movie in a visual sense, and had good horror for the sake of horror, but not of the calibre of say a Cronenberg or Hitchcock. It might seem that Del Toro built the sets and ghosts, loved them so much, and then just tried to fit in a story, with any old horror trope, and hope we wouldn't notice. Well I noticed and was disappointed."

",0.3818,0.6783,2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"What can I say? I was greatly impressed by everything in this movie, if I'm being honest. I was enamoured by the somber tone and the Gothic style of the story. The production design is really something to behold and admire. Visually it is a marvellous spectacle, it is truly one of Guillermo del Toro's undeniable strengths. The clever use of certain colours such as red and symbolism really fit with the horrific setting and back story. Even the costumes are amazing, specially those worn by Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). A huge plus I want to
give to this movie is the complete absence of cheap jumpscares; this film managed to be scary simply by introducing its scary elements slowly but always in frame; which made me contemplate the frightening figures
for a longer period of time, thus making its purpose much more effective.I'll leave the details of the plot to your viewing experience; I will just comment on the high quality performances by the main actors. Mia Kasikowska does a fantastic job, she reminded me of Joan Fontaine as Mrs. de Winter in Hitchcock's Rebecca in some moments. Both Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain fantastically deliver haunting performances, with their characters torn between good and evil at key points in the film. I was blown away by Chastain's performance, specially when her intentions are fully revealed.I was completely immersed in the viewing experience, almost as if I was omnipresent yet a part of the tale. That's what each and every single one of the elements I mentioned above do when they are exceptionally well-put
together by a competent filmmaker like Del Toro, who has his own particular style completely figured out and able to manage it with taste and stylistic artistic direction.If you're looking for a great gothic-styled movie, this is it. The visuals will astonish you, the horror elements will surprise you and its story will captivate you.
Give it a try."

Then the villains are revealed and all is left is a slow painful crawl to the predictable ending. It didn't help that Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston played very well, it didn't help that the sets and the mood of the film were perfect, all because the story was weak and predictable. If this would have been written by Edgar Allan Poe, it would have been a classic. As it is, it's just something I've seen before many times.It took me three years to gather the time and courage to see this film, in the end I've watched it at 2x speed and still felt the need to fast forward.

",0.0,0.9965,2018-07-12 00:00:00,6,"I hate skipping plot summaries when I write one of these, but I think it's probably best when discussing Crimson Peak. The plot here isn't all that important. Crimson Peak is one of those ""style over substance"" movies. The plot takes a backseat to the cinematography, lighting, costumes, sets, special effects, and just about anything else you can list that makes a movie look good. And what plot there is in Crimson Peak is so filled with holes, I fear that dwelling on it will only make me like the movie less. I'll just say that the plot left me with more questions than it answered.If films are art, Crimson Peak belongs next to the Mona Lisa. It is one of the most stunning pieces of film I've ever seen. Every frame looks like a painting. I'm not sure I've seen a film this beautiful since I watched House of Flying Daggers over ten years ago. The colors, the shadows, the lights - gorgeous. My absolute favorite image (and I'm not alone based on what I've read across the internet) is the ceiling-less grand hall in the rotting great house. It's amazing. Another element that really helps the images come alive is the atmosphere. I may not care for Guillermo del Toro's plot, but there's not denying his skill as a director. He mastfully fills the film with atmosphere so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Combine the atmosphere with the visuals and you end up with a movie I'm going to enjoy on some level despite its other flaws. The acting in Crimson Peak is hit or miss. Normally, I feel that Tom Hiddleston outshines his co-stars, Here, however, he's completely over-shadowed by Jessica Chastain. She acts circles around everyone else in the film. Her role is the smallest of the three main characters, but she dominates everything - even the scenes she's not in. Overall, if you're a fan of gothic romance/horror/mystery (although the horror elements don't come to much and the solution to the mystery is all too obvious) you owe it to yourself to check out his gorgeous film."
" Crimson Weak
",-0.4404,-0.714,2018-07-08 00:00:00,3,"Guillermo Del Toro comes an awful cropper with this movie. Just about every horror film cliche is doped out in a gorgeous-looking, appallingly-scripted film. and the thing is so silly it becomes unintentionally funny.Tom Hiddlestone is okay, Jessica Chastain gives the sort of performance she might want to leave off her CV. Mia Wasiowsaka's character is so dumb it's hilarious.The script writers obviously realised how bad it was, as they up the gore content to ridiculous levels. The last 30 minutes is pretty much just bodily injury time as everyone gets stabbed, sliced, hacked and bashed. Mia, who has been suffering from slow posioning throughout the movie's second half, becomes a shovel-wielding battler at the end. Tom, of course, reforms all of a sudden when he really does fall in love - ah bless. It's a plot twist you can spot coming a mile off. The women will be happy that he displays his arse Kirk Douglas style.Thanks for all the exposition from phonograph cylinders, handily filling in the gaps for all those audience members who are a bit dim, while at the same time ripping off Dracula. Sorry - in this post-modernist era it's a smart reference, of course for all the psueds. There are plenty of others. I'm just suprised Tom didn't have a monster bubbling in the vat, as they might as well as ripped off Frankenstein as well.I suspect this may become a great guilty pleasure in years to come. Makes me glad Del Torro's Lovecraft movie fell through."

This is a very classy horror fantasy and I enjoyed every moment."
" Jane Eyre meets House of Usher with ghosts of the past
",0.0,0.3053,2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak"" is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, ""Crimson Peak"" has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""The Others"" (2001) and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994), but it's thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein,"" which is why I cite ""The Others."" Psychological Gothic horror like ""Demons of the Mind"" (1972) and ""The Eternal"" (1998) are other comparisons. If you're in the mood for a movie like these, you'll probably appreciate ""Crimson Peak.""Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies I've ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.Some people think the story is meh, but it's no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critic's list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 59 minutes and was shot in Hamilton, Kingston and Toronto, Canada.

" Beautiful start, upside down middle and confusing end
",0.4588,0.5624,2018-05-06 00:00:00,5,"My judgement is purely based on the screenplay I read not the movie itself. But what I have read from the movie synopsis it seems they somewhat deviated from the story while making it. The story starts beautifully - interesting female protagonist, Edith, her father - self-made businessman, Boston society. Then it gets confusing with each turn as Edith who is a clever, educated and aspiring, suddenly becomes somewhat dumb and starry eyed and falls for the antagonist too easily - Mr. Sharp. Then her father turns into an antagonist too... Being a woman several scenes stood out as not quite true or believable - one is when Mr. Sharp comes to Edith at night asking her to join him to the Ball, when couple of hours before she refused to go there with her father. From being in her pyjamas and writing away her book she suddenly transported to the Ball, all beautifully dressed and stuns everyone with her dance... In real life try to get a woman out of her pyjamas and into the Ball... Good luck, I would say, as women need lots of time to prepare. I also found it not very believable when her father would not show her the papers that he discovered about Mr. Sharp but instead keeps it secret and pays Sharp to leave and also break her heart too. Not quite the character that was portrayed in the beginning of the story. Personally, I think there was no need for any ghosts at all, as Edith discovers the truth by finding clothes and albums of previous women who stayed at the castle and were murdered, so she is able to understand what has happened and will happen to her. Doctor suddenly becoming alive in the basement also is unrealistic and does not serve any purpose... The end is also very confusing - Edith gets out saying she decided to live but she never gave an impression of a person who did not want to live... I believe it could have been such a wonderful story but somehow it was lost to maybe 'too many cooks' and a wish to make a horror movie out of it. What a pity."
" Waste of Del Toro
",-0.4215,-0.5859,2018-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Pan's Labyrinth made sense because the underlying motif was the Spanish Civil War and the horrors of the war allowed the nightmare imagery.
This on the contrary is just a petit guignol gothic melodrama. While it shows that Hiddleston is suited to the saturnine and cadaverous, Jessica Chastain's role as the evil sister is thoroughly overplayed.
But the red skeletons that keep appearing do nothing but make you laugh - they are too shiny and synthetic and ther movements comic in their efforts to scare. What a waste of Dle Toro's imagination - maybe he needs the money - yet he put his name to the script. 
And what on earth is the red liquid underground clay that they pump out - there's not enough story to suggest it's a metaphor for anything - and I've never heard of red sludge there for the digging.
You can't introduce too many random fantasy elements or it fails to dispel the disbelief. 
There were also elements that were foregrounded to have a significance but then never did - the clay machine, the dog, the red vat of gunk, the faithful retainer. 
Three stars is over generous."
" A stylish gothic horror
",-0.5719,-0.9098,2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"As this gothic horror opens protagonist Edith Cushing tells us that ghosts are real; we see how the ghost of her mother warned her to 'beware of Crimson Peak'. Years pass and Edith meets Sir Thomas Sharpe, a baronet hoping her father will invest in his mining machinery. He soon starts to court Edith but breaks it off when her father confronts him with certain information that has come into his possession. Shortly afterwards her father is brutally murdered and Sir Thomas marries Edith. They leave America and return to Allerdale Hall, his home in England, along with his sister Lucille. Allerdale Hall was once impressive but now it is somewhat dilapidated; Lucille tells Edith that certain areas of house are too dangerous as she refuses to give her the house keys. Edith soon starts seeing more ghosts; clearly something very bad in the house once. Back in America the truth about Sir Thomas is learnt and family friend Dr Alan McMichael heads to England to save Edith; the question is whether or not he will get there in time.Coming from writer/director Guillermo del Toro it is hardly surprising that this is very stylish with chills taking priority over more obvious scary moments. Early on it is hard to tell whether Sir Thomas is charming or just a charmer and once the action moves to England it soon looks as though Edith has made a terrible mistake. There is a constant sense that something is wrong; not just when Edith sees some impressively grotesque ghosts... no slightly see-through people here! Everything looks very stylish; from Edith's vivid yellow dress to the deep red of the clay Allerdale Hall is built on. The cast does a fine job; Mia Wasikowska really impresses as Edith, a character who is both strong and vulnerable; Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain also impress as Sit Thomas and Lucille; keeping their characters ambiguous for much of the film. For the most part it is chilling rather than scary but there are shocking moments that are very violent and quite gory. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of gothic horror."

I imagine if you have an old run down place, it qualifies as ""Gothic."" The horror felt forced also. The cinematography and costume was done well, in spite of the fact of opening the film in Buffalo.

Anyone familiar with some of Del Toro's other work will see a lot of his signature visual touches, which is far from being a bad thing, and the design of the ghosts was refreshingly innovative and blended into the overall visual style. The plot is interesting once it gets going, however slightly predictable. Sadly, there are some noticeable downsides. The most obvious one is how slowly this film starts, with seemingly very little happening for the first twenty or so minutes. The focus is very heavily on the plot, and while some characters are developed more slowly because it ties in with the plot, others can feel underdeveloped. When this is combined with the slow start, it makes the first part of this film fairly boring. Some of the chronology of this film can seem slightly strange as well, when scrutinised. However, despite its faults, this is still a good film and worth watching. 7/10"

With this continues the disappointment. I do not know how he did it in the other but he does not look like anything in any of his other films.

The utterly ridiculous plot, so badly cobbled together from a handful of implausible premises that it actually makes your eyes water to follow it onscreen? The cringe-makingly horrendous acting, complete with terrible accents from at least two of the main protagonists? The lurid sets that look like they came straight from some cheesy 90s computer game? The bubble-gum-coloured CGI ghosts that would look at home in even cheesier computer games than those of the sets? The hackneyed score that punctuates every move of every leaf, doorknob and eyebrow and that we seem to have heard thousands upon thousands of times before? Yes, folks, it's all here. A true compendium of all the don'ts of filmmaking. And then one asks: how oh how does such unadulterated garbage make it to the big screen? Fudge knows. This is the cinematic equivalent of a very cheap, very rusty 1950s ghost-train ride in a very rundown fairground managed by illiterate crooks, only it comes disguised under a thick veneer of glossy technicolor paint to fool the one or two under-sixes who might just be able to watch this plastic cheeseburger of a film to the end without throwing their arms up in total disgust."
" Well put together creepy film
",0.2732,0.9889,2018-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Crimson Peak (2015) is a Guillermo Del Toro film, which means it has a good chance of being high quality. Del Toro is famous for his acclaimed film, Pans Labrynth. There are good things this had going for it, the director of course, and also the very talented cast. The cast includes Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston and more. They all played their roles well, special mention for Chastain, who gives a deliciously creepy, spot on performance as the suspicious sister in law. The plot is very intriguing and the advertisements really drew me in to watching it. I like how they executed the plot, for the most part at least. It has a nice build up, gives the characters some depth before just jumping straight into the scary/creepy stuff. But when the creepy stuff comes, it works. I liked that everything had a backstory, throughout most of the film you aren't really sure what all is happening, which is good, it builds suspense. Another big positive here are the visuals, they are just immaculate. The mansion, the snow, the ghosts.... I just really loved both the beautifully done production design and the creepy atmosphere that set the mood.

",0.3716,0.9941,2017-12-21 00:00:00,3,"Take a whole lotta Jane Eyre, including some lines lifted almost verbatim; mix in some Fall of the House of Usher; wrap it in amazing, gorgeous sets and costumes; throw in some good actors, including one stunning beauty (Jessica, with a dodgy English accent) and one who actually played Jane Eyre (Mia); and voila, you have... a great looking, plodding mish-mash of gothic themes and images but no core or center. It is interminable. The plot could have been good, but it just goes on and on and on. After a while, the ghosts are a big yawn. It starts pretty well, while we have a plucky heroine. Much is made of her writing, but eventually this just disappears into the cold, red sludge, along with all her personality. I kept thinking, this looks amazing, I love gothic stuff, I adore Jane Eyre, I really liked Del Toro's previous work, so why is this totally failing to engage me? I really wanted to like this. But it's definitely a ""meh"" from me."
" A tribute to classic horror
",-0.5719,0.9489,2017-12-08 00:00:00,8,"This what I like to call 'your mom's horror movie'. It's a love story set in a previous century, there's some mystery but zero intrigue and occasionally you get some spooky (don't mistake for scary) scenes. It's not everyone's cup of tea but I don't think this movie deserves any less than a 6. It is a stylish little peace that leaves you with a slight feeling of melancholy as Del Toro's films tend to do.The story follows the Gothic novel formula: an old mansion, a family secret, some ghosts and romance. Apart from the hustle, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. In fact I think the story would've been much more entertaining if it focused more on the villains and their scheme instead of showing it to us from the victims point of view(because each step that the heroine takes is predictable). Ironically the antagonists turned out to be more interesting and developed characters compared to her.The design of the ghosts is actually pretty interesting. Sadly, they appear just for scares. The ghosts are merely metaphors just like it was stated in the begging of the movie. It would've been more interesting if they played some role story-wise like persuade the heroine to avenge their death by killing off the Sharpe siblings.Which leads me to the final problem I had with 'Crimson Peak'. It builds up as this stylish and refined horror but in the end Lucille gets killed off with a shovel to head like it's 'Evil Dead' or something and Edith even delivers a one-liner after wards. The part where she gets Lucille to turn around is silly. The whole scene is just comedic and out of place. So was the sex scene but I don't even wanna get into it. It would've been smarter if Edith fixed Lucille's tea and gave her a taste of her own medicine if you know what I mean.Despite it's flaws I liked the movie's appreciation of classic horror. The acting was good. I'm not really fond of Mia Wasikowska but the others were great and Mia looks good in vintage gowns. The use of color and texture keeps you focused on the screen from beginning to end. Most modern horror movies just make it as dark as possible and put a teal color filter on it. Some people compare its style to 'Suspiria' but I would say that it's much closer to Mario Bava's 'Blood and Black Lace' and the third episode of 'Black Sabbath'. You'll see not only the similarities in style but even where inspiration for the ghosts came from."

Yes, the story itself is predictable but the fine actors and especially the superb visuals give enough goodies for the connoisseur of Gothic horror. Director Guillermo del Toro knows his business, and the main actors Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston play their roles well. A good watch for you if you like such movies as The Woman in Black, The Others, A Cure For Wellness, The Awakening, Fall of the House of Usher etc.For the visuals a nine, the acting and directing a 7 and for the story a 5. Makes a neat 7."
" Love the atmosphere and cinematography!
",0.6696,0.9048,2017-10-30 00:00:00,7,"The lighting in this film is gorgeous, both adding to the atmosphere and implying subtle details about the characters. Cinematography is beautiful, with eerie and sinister props/settings. This really adds to the lighting effects. I loved the snow gracefully falling down the scenes. Costumes were suited to the time period and again adds to the atmosphere.Guillermo del toro crafts a suspenseful and scary tone, as I really became worried for the main character! The plot being really interesting as well. However, sometimes the main character can be quite naive, which sometimes becomes a little frustrating. But this may not bother some and probably represents the time period. A great watch for halloween or just in general!"
" Great visuals, superb acting...kind of a predictable plot
",0.8481,0.9962,2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film as it has that Guillermo Del Toro style to it which means some very good visuals. He crafted a very lovely period piece that injects us into a world where things are not as they seem and where one wonders who to trust. That being said, when revelations were made, there was not anything all that surprising and I honestly thought the ending would entail something cooler. Still, it was a pretty good story, just nothing that is really going to be making you gasp in surprise. The house within the film looks incredible and is a house that I would love to explore and they actually apparently made the entire house; unfortunately, they promptly tore it down after filming to make room in the studio.The story has a young woman recount the first time she had seen a ghost. It happened to be her mother and the apparition carried with it a warning to stay away from Crimson Peak. Years later the young woman meets a strange man from Europe. He is trying to garner funds so that he may create a device to get the red clay that resides on his land out of the earth so that it may be processed and used. The young woman's father scoffs at the idea and is immediately suspicious of the stranger from another land. This stranger soon begins to warm up to the daughter which makes the father more suspicious. Well, in the end the young woman ends up married to the stranger and they head off to he and his sister's very dilapidated mansion. During her stay there she sees things within the walls as the very house seems to have a life of its own, but the true terror may reside in the heart of her husband! The acting is really good. I liked the guy who played the father as I liked how he was immediately suspicious. Tom Hiddlestone was great as the mysterious stranger too. The true star though was that really warped house they created as it looked incredibly creepy. A house that seems ready to collapse at any time. Honestly, I am surprised the character of Edith did not just turn around once she set foot inside that thing. Looks like it would be cool to explore, but there is a freaking hole in the ceiling where it constantly is raining debris down below! So I enjoyed the film, would have been better with a bit more supernatural flair to it. It does have supernatural elements to it, but I was expecting it to be more supernatural than it turned out to be. It is Guillermo though so his movies generally have a look to them that can make up for the fact that sometimes the story is lacking. This one's look does that as does the acting in it. I am pretty sure most figured out what was going on fairly quickly, but it is just a matter of how it plays out."
" looks great but terrible story
",-0.3818,-0.886,2017-10-18 00:00:00,4,Would be better without sound. The decor is stunning but the script is abdominal. The script is similar to all other horror movie clichés. When you are in a life threatening situation always stay in the easily escapable situation and shout: who is there?. I don't believe the average human being would act in that way. To me it seems as if non of the actors posses any sense of rationality or danger. A movie for late nights under influence while reading a book with loud music.

The red clay looked like blood coming from the earth. This is a very original movie. In fact I have never seen a movie on this subject matter before. The ""crimson peak"" looked eerie covered in snow. I would recommend this movie."

" Gothic with a Capital G
",0.0,0.9828,2017-09-08 00:00:00,9,"After seeing Guillermo del Toro movies like ""Mimic,"" ""Blade II,"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I came to realize that he loves to model his works in the style of Gothic. There is nothing wrong with that. Like Tim Burton, he enjoys mixing his colors around, particularly the dark ones. I saw trailers to ""Crimson Peak"" and read up on it on the Upcoming Horror Movies website, which made me want to know more because I am curious about certain movies like this one.Seeing it just once made my blood run cold. It really did. I do not like writing reviews that are laced with spoilers, so I'll just say this to anyone who is interested: Go in it with an open mind. Watch it carefully so that you can take in all of the details. You might miss a few things if you don't watch it closely. It is a good movie that is done in true Guillermo del Toro style. To conclude, I guarantee that you will not see a film ensemble like that ever again."

It's stupid. The second most typical part is where the old man kneels down next to the sink to pick the razor up as the killer sneaks up from behind. Could he have taken longer kneeling down? I mean he goes about it like it's just such a pain in the @$$ and turns it into a project."
" Pretty but boring, and not remotely scary
",0.3802,0.9562,2017-08-24 00:00:00,3,"I thought I'd give this film a shot since famed horror author Stephen King called it ""Gorgeous and just f---ing terrifying"". Well, it was gorgeous... The costume design is great, but the story is dull, predictable, and not at all scary. Mia Wasikowska's acting leaves much to be desired; that girl is like a walking wet rag. Jessica Chastain's Lucille is almost cartoonish in her ridiculousness. The ""scandalous twist"" isn't much of a twist and, if you paid any attention to the trailer or promos for the film, you knew exactly what it was. This seems more like a paycheck movie than any kind of ""labor of love"" or ""homage to the art of horror"". Definitely not Guillermo Del Toro's best work, though I know he considers it a ""gothic romance"" rather than a horror movie or even a thriller. It's as if even he knows it lacks surprises, suspense, and especially scares."
" Horror To Endure
",-0.5719,0.7172,2017-08-20 00:00:00,2,"If you have not seen Crimson Peak before, yes you have. About a thousand times. Sometimes less lavishly, less melodramatic, less formulamatic, lesser-known cast, etc. The only ground this film breaks is the pink-ooze built into the setting and plot. The heroine is possibly the stupidest character ever to make it to screen; e.g., having seen monsters and apparitions in the morning wanders about in the afternoon as if she's on vacation. The leading male creep is as handsome and charismatic as a bathroom plunger. The dialogue gives new definition to contrived. What was del Toro thinking? ""I'll make the ultimate Gothic horror film!"". And who and why, Guilllmero, would anyone be interested in sitting through two-hours af absolute predictability watching caricatures mouth loaded banalities to one another? Emily Bronte, Mary Shelley and Edgar Allen Poe are laughing so hard they're busting out of their graves."

And most of them are accurate; It's a nice looking movie but doesn't really have much of a story to hold it together. When the more horror elements make their way in, you get a glimpse of what a better movie might have looked like. But the bulk of it settles into being a middling sibling drama.The acting is all acceptable with Jessica Chastain stepping outside her usual roles and actually turning in a good, albeit 2 dimension performance.Can't really recommend watching this since it's such a slog at 2 hours long. It's a shame since I think there was a chance for a pretty good horror movie in there but instead we get a dull drama peppered with gore."

Is it a Gothic horror? Yeah, sorta. Kinda. Is it a Victorian romance drama? Sure. Sure. There are scares and swoons in equal measure. I suppose the more difficult is question; Is it any good? The answer isn't a simple one.This isn't a movie for everyone--It certainly wasn't for me.--but it's a movie that I can appreciate, if not exactly like, for its technical craftsmanship. As with all of del Toro's films, it's a visual feast, and can be appreciated on the strength of that alone. The cast is filled with wonderful actors sincerely and earnestly sinking their teeth into the soppy melodrama, making it work better than it probably should.My gut tells me this is probably a bit of a polarizing film. If it's in your wheelhouse, you'll probably love it. If not, the two hour runtime is likely to be more painful than the corsets the ladies are wearing."
" The Unholy Trilemma
",0.0,-0.948,2017-06-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a meta-film. Just like it's a story with a ghost in it, it's a film with a book in it. We can see the book open and close in the end, with Edith's name on it. But you really have to look carefully not to miss it. So, maybe that's why the film resembles those penny dreadfuls written by working class boys. Or women? I know Del Toro intended to make a feminist film, whatever that may be, but the story revolves around a man, with two women fighting a bloody battle over him in the end. The man, played by Tom Hiddleston, is a perfect picture of narcissistic personality disorder, which again makes him more interesting than the leading ""good"" lady, played by Mia Wasikowska. As a true gentleman, Tom Hiddleston shows us his ass, again stealing the limelight from the ladies. This is not just a study in Victorian morals, it is also the revival of Victorian morals. Mario Bava films, Hammer horrors and Giallo films were full of female nudity. I find this new sort of feminism boring and moralistic. I shall have to take a look at this film again, maybe one day when I forget about Tom Hiddleston's face while being dragged to different airports by Taylor Swift. Jessica Chastain gives a great performance, but no tits. I can't decide whether showing tits today makes you a good actress, a brave woman, or a total slut. Looks like the whole showbiz is stuck with this trilemma, too."

" A Beautiful And Entertaining Guillermo Del Torro Masterpiece.
",0.8979,0.9978,2017-05-11 00:00:00,9,"While watching this beautiful motion picture one thought kept flickering through my mind; this is what a modern Hammer film should look like - it so reminded me of the classic '60's and '70's films.Guillermo Del Torro has created another masterpiece filled with vivid and beautiful imagery and superb transitions between the light - happy - and dark -eerie - atmospheres, which work well on the emotions. Along with superb acting from the cast and a potent story, with the help of Matthew Robins, we are given the tale of twisted love and greed, which builds slowly with twists and turns throughout.What always surprises me most is that Del Torro takes some of the nastiest parts of the human psyche and the violent actions they include and shows them in such a gorgeous way while never glorifying or condoning them is amazing.This is the story of Edith Cushing, lovingly portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, a solitary and intelligent woman trying to make her way as an author in a man's world. She meets and falls in love with Thomas Sharpe, played elegantly by Tom Hiddleston, who is in town trying to raise funds for his mining machine from her father, Carter Cushing, who is admirably portrayed by Jim Beaver. However, her father doesn't like Thomas and does everything he can to stand in the way of their relationship. It's only after his death that Edith is free to wed Thomas and move out to Crimson Peak.As the days pass, Edith begins to realise that maybe her father was right, there's something not quite right with Thomas and his sister Lucille, strongly portrayed by Jessica Chastain... or the house they live in...I fell in love with this film right from the start. It's so stylish with its lighting, camera angles, and sound, that it fits perfectly with the era in which it's set. Even the End Credits are beautiful to watch. There are a lot of directors trying too hard to be stylish and here Del Torro makes it appear effortless. The special effects are really good, the one scene where the ghost is dragging itself up and along the floor is pretty creepy. I also liked the effect of the clay on the snow, turning it blood red, that was a nice touch.I would recommend this movie to everyone - it now resides at the top of my favourite Del Torro movies."
" One Of The Most Beautiful-Looking Horror Movies Ever Made
",-0.6096,-0.9729,2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Just had the pleasure of seeing a Guillermo del Toro film that I had greatly wanted to see when it opened around 18 months ago, the Gothic masterpiece ""Crimson Peak."" The film stars Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston (whom most viewers, including myself, probably know best as Loki in Marvel's Thor and Avengers movies) and Jessica Chastain. In the film, which initially transpires in the Buffalo, NY region of the very early 20th century, Mia marries a destitute baronet, Hiddleston, and returns to his decrepit English mansion, Crimson Peak, along with his sister (Chastain). Her mother's ghost had twice warned her away from any place with that name, but off she goes, to her eventual regret. Soon enough, other ghosts arise to warn and frighten her, and she soon learns the terrible secrets of the place, and of her new husband and sister-in-law. The look of the film is absolutely spectacular, and how the costumers, cinematographers, set designers and set decorators for the film did not win Oscars is beyond me. This might be one of the most gorgeous-to-look-at horror films ever made! And yes, despite the love story at its core, this is most decidedly a horror film, and a pretty darn violent and bloody one as well. All three leads give superb performances, and practically every shot demands to be frozen on the screen and examined. The film grows wilder and crazier as it proceeds, and the finale is one not for the squeamish. This will surely go down for me as a nominee for Top 10 status come year's end, I have a feeling. I really did love this one. It's currently showing on many of the HBO channels, for those who get them...."

" Crimson Peak- Gothic romance at its best
",0.8316,0.9992,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Since the movie hit the theaters time has passed, but I believe it is never too late to see and review a good movie. As you may have noticed by my introduction I did not watch it when it first came out, even while it did grip my attention. I suspect it must have been the fact that it was marked as a horror movie, a genre I avoid, a fact that as it seems also kept other possible viewers from seeing it. Be as it is, I'm not going to chit-chat, I'm writing a review. Let's start.Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young bright woman and her fathers only child living in 1901 Buffalo, New York. As an aspiring writer she gets nothing more that a few amused smiles, until she meets the handsome English baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who seems to be smitten not only by her writing but also with her. He, who came searching for investors to finance his new clay-mining device, gets rejected not only by the financier but also by Edith's father, who feels an unease in the presence of this young man. The sudden and surprising death of her father leads Edith deeper into Thomas'arms and the young couple travels to his home back in England. Allerdale Hall is everything else but a shining castle and her sister-in-law Lucille (Jessica Chastain) seems as cold as the winds that blow through the many holes in the roof. At first Edith tries to make the best of it, but with a sister-in-law cold and unsettling like a shadow, a husband who is kind but distant and a house where ghost's whisper warnings at night it does not take long until her life is in threat when dark secrets come to the light.Well, there are so many things that should be talked about, that this fact alone should make you interested. I already noted that this movie was wrongly advertised as a horror while it actually is nothing else then a Gothic romance, a style very popular in the 19th century. Imagine it like a mix of Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" and Hitchcock's ""Rebbeca""- being more like the later one. Add a few ghosts. The performances and characterizations of all the actors are top, the best you can get. We have side characters like Edith's father (played by Jim Beaver) who is IMO a refreshing realistic good father and we have also Edith's childhood friend Dr Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) who all the time senses something bad approaching and aids her for help. You may argue that he could have said something earlier, but then again, who is he to forbid her to marry the one she wants, and if that someone is not he then its fine too, all he wants is her too be happy. Also, without any evidence there was nothing he could say. Now lets get to the three main character, and man, they hit it. Mia Wasikowska as Edith is a wonderful choice (I only saw her as Alice in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and did not like her, but again, nobody was good there) being an educated bright young woman who searches friendship and love in the people she knows. She plays it never bland, shy at most, which is more then fitting given everything she goes through. Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas will surely make a few hearts out there skip beats, giving his character enough elegance and kindness while slowly letting the darkness shine through, all while adding a touch of vulnerability to it. And speaking of darkness, Jessica Chastain as Lucille will make everyone's blood run cold, playing her character as mysterious and twisted as you only can.While I listed all the character and performances pretty much on their own, I will like to note that the relationships, all of them, is what makes them so special. There is a motive through out all the movie with butterflies and moths, Edith being the butterfly searching and meaning sunshine and Lucille the moth in the dark eating weak butterflies, which shows perfectly everything. Promotional posters also have Thomas being overshadowed by a human skull representing death and Alan having angel wings appearing in the background showing his role in the end as well. All in all, this movie is as much relying on visual storytelling as it is on the script. You could argue that the story in its self is very simple, but the visuals are what carry everything through. We have wonderful and amazing costumes, we have a haunting gorgeous old house that slowly sinks into blood-red clay, visual storytelling at it best in all ways. If you fear it may be too scary with the ghosts, let me tell you that they are more unsettling than scary and might actually not even really be there. Its the atmosphere that makes this somewhat a ""scary movie"" and not jump-scares and unneeded gore.I highly recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good piece of mystery, great atmosphere, amazing visuals and a bit of romance. And I hope even people who, like me, needed time to finally see it will be positively surprised."

" Kind of a Gothic-ghost-horror movie
",0.0,0.9783,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I don't usually watch this type of film, so I don't come at this with the knowledge of some people who reviewed this on IMDb.Crimson Peak stars Mia Wasikowska as aspiring writer Edith Cushing in Buffalo, NY. She believes she sees the ghost of her mother at times - her mother died when she was quite young.She meets a handsome, romantic inventor, Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who has come to the states to find investors for his harvest machine. He wants to marry her, but her father, who has hired a detective to investigate Thomas and his sister, the lovely Lucille (Jessica Chastain), objects. Then he is killed. Edith marries Thomas and goes to England to live in the family home. Think Grand Guignol on acid. The place is a disaster with part of the roof gone and water coming in. So comfy. Then she starts running into this red skeleton telling her to leave. Yes, this film is pretty predictable, with some wonderful production values and a great cast. I just saw Mia in the show In Treatment, as a teenaged gymnast, and she was fabulous. I haven't seen her in her adult years in anything but this. Her role isn't straightforward - she is supposed to be emancipated and yet she's frail.Directed by Guillermo del Toro, there were hints of ""Notorious"" toward the end.It's a good rental."

",0.3291,0.4782,2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I don't think Guillermo del Toro has ever made a movie that I don't like. Running through the list in my head, I really can't pick one out. He is such a good director. Having said that. This seems to be the worst one out of the bunch, and yet I was well entertained by this movie. Probably more so than a lot of people. Let's get to the review.Synopsis: Edith Cushing's mother died when she was young but watches over her. Brought up in the Victorian Era she strives to be more than just a woman of marriageable age. She becomes enamored with Thomas Sharpe, a mysterious stranger. After a series of meetings and incidents she marries Thomas and comes to live with him and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe, far away from everything she has known. The naive girl soon comes to realize not everything is as it appears as ghosts of the past quite literally come out of the woodwork. This movie is more about mystery and suspense than gore. Starring: Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam Director: Guillermo del ToroThe first thing I want to do is get the two things out of the way that I really didn't like about the movie. The first thing is the fact that I pretty much figured out what was going on before Mia and Tom's characters even got married in the movie. I'm not saying it's a terrible thing, but he did hurt the movie a bit. Just because I did know the ending doesn't mean the movie wasn't still entertaining.The second thing, and I may get a crap ton of flak for this but, is Mia Wasikowska. I don't know what it is about this girl, I just don't like her as an actress. She just doesn't have that charisma factor to me. She has the one expression over and over again and she is as stiff as a board most of the time.On to the good things. Tom and Charlie were the best things of this movie. There isn't a single character they haven't played that isn't quite amazing. This movie only solidifies them as some of the best actors of this time.You already know how I feel about the director, but one thing I hardly ever talk about is the setting of the movie. It does take an hour to get to the Crimson Peak, but it is worth it. The design of the house is scarier than some of the real haunted houses out in the world. del Toro really knows how to create the perfect atmosphere for his movies. He made it seem more than what it was.Final Thoughts: Even though I am giving this movie a 7 out of 10 it is still a very watchable movie. If you haven't watched it yet, you probably should.Rating: 7 out of 10"
" A Movie for Another Time
",0.0,0.9484,2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Don't get me wrong—I liked this movie from the great Guillermo del Toro, a filmmaker I have admired since his amazing 'Pan's Labyrinth.' And similar to that film, 'Crimson Peak' is beautifully crafted, like the china teacup Lucille uses to serve Edith her questionable tea. Unlike del Toro's earlier effort, though, this movie felt distant and terribly formal to me—the Noble Style vs. a rollicking square dance. And, speaking of dances, there was no better scene to illustrate this aloofness than the one in which Thomas waltzes with Edith in front of her father.To me, the best horror is visceral, not mannered. Referring back to the Hollywood classics of the 1930s, 'Crimson Peak' felt closer to 'Wuthering Heights' than 'Frankenstein.' Sure, we get to see abominable CG apparitions, but even they are distant. They never really engage with Edith in a way that would induce sheer terror in a cultured young woman. Of course, I realize they are there to WARN her, rather than scare her. But still  By now, movie audiences have been exposed to such fare as 'Saw,' 'The Human Centipede' and 'House of 1000 Corpses.' Pretty hardcore stuff, don't you think? To my way of thinking, resurrecting Gothic horror was a bit of a risk for everyone involved. Why did they do it?I've seen a lot of horror movie devices over the years, but never clay. Usually, desolate places like Cumberland are filled with moors floating in a dense white mist. But clay? This didn't really work for me. Sure, it was red and resembled blood, but . They never really DID anything with it—even when they had their chance in the cellar, which held huge wooden vats of the stuff. Maybe those scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. And as long as we're talking about missed opportunities, what about Edith's so-called writing? She managed to bang out one story and never really writes another word during the rest of the film. Okay, the movie is not about her writing, but the story would have worked just as well without it.'Crimson Peak' did not do well at the box office. As of this writing (April 2016), it has earned $75M worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, with a production budget of $55M. Compare that to Warner Bros.' 2013 hit 'The Conjuring,' which to date has grossed $318M worldwide, with a production budget of $20M. To me, 'Crimson Peak' was a movie for another audience in another time.In the trailer, the quote ""Gorgeous and terrifying—it electrified me"" is attributed to Stephen King. Terrifying? Really? Come on, Steve. I can't imagine that anything short of an alligator chewing your fingers off one at a time would be terrifying to you. And certainly not this movie. Disturbing, yes—especially concerning the twisted relationship between Thomas and Lucille. Henry James would be proud. As I said, I liked 'Crimson Peak' but, sadly, I went into the thing wanting to love it."
" I feel so bad for all the effort put into this
",-0.5849,0.9771,2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"I was very excited to see this film, because I'm a Del Toro fan. I like his visual style and Pan's Labyrinth is a legendary film for me. The movie however, fails to meet the expectation. It is supposed to be a quirky, creepy but visually rich story with ghosts in it. The script is so weak that I got the impression of having watched this movie, although it was impossible. There have been so many movies in a haunted house, with 2 perverted siblings, whatsoever, that you immediately get a dejavu. The only surprise (which is not really a surprise if you're a movie nerd) is that the siblings f*ck each other. The rest of the story is very weak. The lines are so lame. No references to anything. You feel like you're reading a badly written children's novel. I'm really not a hater. On the contrary I was very ready to praise this film. I've just read the trivia here and I see that the house was completely designed only for the movie. The costumes were ""blah blah"" fabric. Ms Chastain learned the PIANO for this role?! It took 6 years for the movie to be finally shot, del Toro wrote 12 versions of the script.. All this effort and yet you have a very averagely shot, boring, visually inadequate film. The costumes looked like they were made in 5 minutes, out of curtains. Very sloppily made, not detailed and not suitable for the time period. Even the hair-styling was so bad I sometimes wanted to cry (especially of Edith). The coloring looked like a bad instagram filter, rather than looking artsy and rich. The house was ridiculous. Everything looked plastic and cheap rather than antique and original.. There was nothing interesting in the story. The ghosts SFX looked like something out of a 90s computer game. Really? Such a great illustrator like Toro can work so hard and only come up with ghosts that look like stupid, red, skeleton men? I can understand the need to emphasize color red here, but it was horribly done. And the things that were supposed to look like blood rather looked like goo. Overall it looked like the budget was 10,000 bucks TOPS. From my point of view, Tom, if he's for the first time fallen in love with someone other than his sister, should not have slept with the sister again, after sleeping with Edith. So many details were unanswered for in the script. What good is it that Edith is a story teller? Why, after listening to the recording in the MAIN HALL OF THE HOUSE WHERE EVERYONE WOULD IMMEDIATELY HEAR HER, she leaves everything and runs in the snow? If she is so intellectual, why doesn't she make a nice plan to run away? Why does she even keep eating the food they give her? Blah blah blah.. I'm very sorry but even a 4 is too much for this. It's one of my fav directors, along with 2 actors that I ADORE, the movie is in the genre that I LOVE, and it's still like sh**.Long story short: No one will read this review but if you do, lower the expectations. A LOT"
" beautiful Gothic horror lacks mystery or thrills
",0.4019,-0.3314,2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Ghosts are real. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) has known this since childhood when her mother died and her spirit warned her, ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" As a young woman, she's trying to publish her ghost story only to face sexism. English baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) has come to America seeking investments from Edith's father Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) for a clay-mining machine invention. Carter distrusts the failing aristocrat and his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain). His investigator Holly finds something damning and he pays Thomas to leave his lovesick daughter Edith. Carter is murdered and Edith marries Thomas. They go back to England but Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) is suspicious as the Cushing fortune is liquidated to the Sharpes in England.This is a beautiful Gothic horror from Guillermo del Toro. It is simply gorgeous. On the other hand, the story lacks thrills or scares. There is no real mystery since the Sharpe siblings lay out their cards early on. It's also unlikely that Carter wouldn't reveal the secret to his daughter. All of it takes away the tension. The Sharpe mansion looks beautiful in a haunted manner. The story needs some reworking to inject more thrilling tension."
" Creepy, Atmospheric and Well Acted
",0.2732,-0.5927,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"One of Guillermo Del Torro's most divisive movies as it was mostly reviled by critics and audiences. However the movie is better than most people are willing to give it credit for. The story of a wealthy woman who marries a mysterious and charming stranger, but butts heads with her new sister-in-law and soon discovers haunting secrets about her new home with deadly consequences in store. The film is well cast with Mia Wasikowska as heroine Edith Cushing, the naive and lovely heiress who aspires to be a successful novelist in late nineteenth century America (and London once she moves to her husband's ancestral home). Edith is prone to being haunted by ghosts as she regularly sees her mother's spectral form warning her of the titular ""Crimson Peak"". Playing the role of Edith's suitor is the devilishly charming Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas Sharpe. The English actor is perfectly suited for the role as he exudes charm and tenderness while harboring sinister secrets that attract us even more to Hiddleston's Thomas. And rounding out the big name leads is Jessica Chastain as Hiddleston's sinister sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe. Chastain plays her character with an out-right disdain for Wasikowska's Edith which leads us to mistrust her immediately. To counter her sinister nature, Chastain demonstrates an eerie control on Hiddleston's Thomas. Her motives for her behavior are kept secret from the viewer until the film's shocking climax when Edith finds out the horrible secrets of the Sharpes.The film keeps an utterly unsettling atmosphere as Del Torro utilizes soft color palettes for lighting and the sets. However the red clay is a garish shade of red to offset the green tones of the titular house. Admittedly the CGI in the film is cheap-looking compared to Del Torro's other films where he blended practical and digital effects much more seamlessly.Still give this film a chance even if you end up hating it."
" Beware of Crimson Peak
",0.0,-0.8982,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"In the turn of the Twentieth Century in Buffalo, New York, the aspiring writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Edith saw the ghost of her mother that warned her to beware of Crimson Peak when she was a child and presently she is writing a ghost story. Now she is visiting a publisher that is friend of her father and she stumbles upon her childhood friend, the ophthalmologist Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), who has returned from overseas and is opening an office in the same building. Out of the blue, she meets the English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who has come to Buffalo with his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) to seek investors to his machine that operates with clay. He has a meeting with Carter Crushing and other businessmen, but Carter refuses to invest in his invention. During the night, the ghost of Edith's mother visits her and warns Edith again to beware of Crimson Peak. Soon Thomas seduces Edith and Carter hires a private detective to investigate the lives of Thomas and Lucille. A couple of days later, the detective brings a report to Carter disclosing dark secrets from the past of the siblings. Carter pays a large amount to Thomas to end his relationship with Edith but he is brutally murdered. Thomas explains to Edith his attitude and they get married and travel to England to live in his derelict mansion over a red clay mine at Allerdale Hall with Lucille. Edith starts to see a red ghost and discovers that an Italian woman has sent a letter to him. Then she becomes weak and coughs blood. What is happening to Edith and what is the mystery of Allerdale Hall and the siblings Sharpe?""Crimson Peak"" is a combination of drama and ghost story by Guillermo del Toro. The performances, direction, locations, cinematography and costumes are magnificent. The conclusion is predictable and the plot uses many clichés, but the film is highly entertaining even for those that are not fans of horror. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Colina Escarlate"" (""The Crimson Hill"")"
