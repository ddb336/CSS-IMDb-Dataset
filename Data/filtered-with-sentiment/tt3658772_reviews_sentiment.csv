" Dreck
",0.0,0.0,2021-03-26 00:00:00,2,Again: Dreck. Pacino and Hopkins phone it in. All other *actors* are just wooden mannequins.
" Typical gritty thriller
",0.1027,-0.9827,2021-03-25 00:00:00,3,"When Josh Duhamel gets hired to head the legal team of head honcho Al Pacino when he's being suing another head honcho Anthony Hopkins, he gets far more than he bargained for. He should have bargained for it, though, since he got the job illegally. Anthony Hopkins's girlfriend, Malin Akerman, approached her married ex-boyfriend Josh with evidence against him, and Josh took it. Wouldn't he think there might be consequences? In this gritty thriller, nothing's off limits. Blackmail, threats, murder, revenge, and of course, misconduct. If you like these kinds of movies where nothing really surprises you but you still get your weekly dose of sex and violence, you can rent it and see what you think. I felt it was a waste of the big stars' talents, since by itself, the script screams 'B-picture'. Malin Akerman is a beautiful woman, but I'd rather see a movie where she's given some acting to do, instead of just a few scenes where she looks good in her lingerie. Keep an eye out for Alice Eve as Josh's wife and Julia Stiles as a police detective. DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. In the church, about 15 minutes before the end, the camera spins completely upside down, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
" Sometimes less is more...
",0.0,-0.6614,2021-02-19 00:00:00,4,"I am genuinely surprised at this trainwreck, which is a perfect metaphor because Misconduct starts out brimming with potential and gets progressively worse over time, barreling ultimately into perhaps the most absurd triple denouement in film history--all of which is tacked on in the last few minutes with NO SETUP whatsoever. All payoff and no setups does not a good film make.One thing I appreciate about this experience is that is serves as an unforgettable reminder that great films do not just happen effortlessly. They require so much planning and discretion and plotting and SETUPS before payoffs. Misconduct completely fails despite having an excellent cast and a promising story and setting. This could have been a great film, but instead it is a disaster."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.0258,2021-02-18 00:00:00,3,"Aren't some people supposed to review the scenario and agree that it make sense to other people?
Embarrassing. Don't watch."
" De Palmaesque
",0.0,0.7157,2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I miss Brian De Palma. There's something about caméras' mouvement that isn't appreciate anymore. It serves thrillers so well. Shimosawa is very talented here, or is it cinematographer Michael Fimognari. Really enjoy the way this story was presented to us. About greed, success, doing the wrong thing for the right reason."
" Mediocre film with excellent cast
",0.5719,0.25,2021-01-08 00:00:00,3,"Mediocre film with excellent cast. Like most people, I only started watching the film because of the cast. The plot itself seems interesting and naughty at the beginning, but all this collapses in 30 minutes. Al Pacino and Anthony Hopkins could pull the film, but no. They played almost cartoon characters. One plays a translated nerdy grandfather, the other plays a devil boss. It only finally gets into a longing, the only thing surprising about this movie is the answer to the question of who killed Emily. From the advantages it is possible to answer only the absence of positive characters."
" Convoluted ""thriller"" short on just about everything...
",0.0,-0.8332,2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I wonder if Josh Duhamel (""Ben"") wasn't just a little dizzy by the end of this overly complicated murder mystery that boasts a good cast, but delivers a rather muddled and confusing plot. He is a lawyer who becomes embroiled in an high level law suit against ""Arthur Denning"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins); a billionaire pharmaceuticals industrialist. Having convinced his boss (Al Pacino) that their case has merit, he proceeds but before he can get any teeth into his proposed prosecution, a deal is struck - and his principal source ""Emily"" (Malin Akerman), who is not without her own peccadilloes and with whom he has started an affair, is found dead - in the apartment he shares with his wife ""Charlotte"" (Alice Eve). Still with me? How did the body get there - moments before the police arrive? Was Emily trying to double-cross him, Hopkins, both? What's Pacino's angle? Who is really pulling all the strings? Well, folks - answers are the one thing this film is desperately short on - so expect to watch for 1¾ hours then ask yourself why you bothered. The narrative and direction are both reminiscent of something Christopher Nolan might have concocted when he was seven and the acting - even from Hopkins and Pacino relies way too much on Duchamel, who - though a good looking chap - has neither the oomph nor the script to make a go of this. I'd hoped for something more along the lines of ""Fracture"" (2007) but sadly not..."
" Poorly directed and edited
",0.0,0.4215,2021-01-03 00:00:00,4,"Can't say much more than the other reviews on here. Plot had potential and could have been much better. Cinematography was ridiculous. The actress who portrayed the wife, Charlie, could have been played by a robot - wooden and emotionless performance."
" Sort of ok until the end
",0.296,0.5563,2020-12-30 00:00:00,4,"The movie gets a few stars because its nice to watch pacino and hopkins doing their thing. Otherwise what really bugs me is that the movie digresses into relationship drama instead of focusing in on the more interesting pharmaceutical coverup story. In the end, the whole original premise of hopkins and even pacino gets lost in the background making it all strangely pointless."
" Watchable, but empty and unrewarding.
",-0.296,0.1269,2020-11-07 00:00:00,4,"Misconduct has a lot going on and does engage, but Duhamel's presence along with his character's reasoning sink the whole endeavour.Ben's poor values aren't addressed, other than Hopkins's character talking to him about it. He should not be with his wife at the end, not because she reveals she killed Emily, but because all this came about unnecessarily, because he's just an a-hole. I can't understand having Hopkins and Pacino in a film and casting Duhamel as the lead, he's quite poor. Hopkins terrific, Pacino solid and Alice Eve likable, bringing something different to a standard role. Julia Stiles must have loved the gig, requiring a few simple responses and expressions."
" the plot idea is good,good cast but a poor film sadly.
",-0.8338,-0.884,2020-09-21 00:00:00,6,"I think this good have been a good film,I like the plot idea and the cast but the finished product is poor.
I don't feel it is as bad as the made for tv films we used to watch on cable in the 1990s but it is not much better.
This is a legal drama of sorts,a lawyer not having a great career breaks the rules to get ahead in his career and everything gets complicated.
We all have bills to pay so I am not going to be too critical of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino being in this.
Duhamel is good in this and I like Alice Eve whose career is beginning to disappoint me.
I wish it was not set in New Orleans because I always feel a film set their will feature corruption and blurred moral issues.
So not an awful film but not great either."
" Go watch grass grow
",0.0,-0.1779,2020-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Literally go do anything else than watch this movie. The plot line is terrible, tries to be dark and twisty. I judge Al Pacino and Anthony Hopkins for agreeing to this."

" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.9029,2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"You would expect a film like this, with two of the biggest stars on the planet, to be enthralling and unforgettable. But no! Their roles were completely shallow, as was the entire film. The plot was simple enough and the kind of story that makes for compelling viewing, but what a hopeless let down. There was precious little character building. In fact the characters were so bland that you start to wonder if you really care about what happens. I was watching this with a friend and we couldn't help but pepper it with sarcastic jokes as it trundled towards a rather weak and stupid conclusion that made no sense. If you want to maintain a good impression of these two great actors, give this movie a wide berth!"
" Misinterpreted
",-0.3182,0.5946,2020-04-26 00:00:00,5,Despite a great cast this film could mot be salvaged. It has way too many holes in it and just wasn't believable. It had little redeeming value. Glad we were able to watch it for free.

",0.0,-0.9115,2020-04-14 00:00:00,5,"If one ever wants to compare stellar actors with those of a far less Ilk this movie personifies that.
Between Pacino and Hopkins there's a lot going on they make one drawn into the movie Unfortunately Duhamel and the actress who plays his wife take away their thunder there is also an area in the movie about 3/4 of the way there that is totally dead but then it picks up again Unfortunately the acting is so poor by some principal actors in this that the whole thing just doesn't gel"
" Really bad
",-0.5849,-0.8522,2019-10-09 00:00:00,3,"Shocking really as some legend actors, but bad music, wooden acting, terrible lines. I couldn't be bothered to watch the last 40 mins."

His young girlfriend gives this secret to a young and talented lawyer who was her ex. When he was going to disclose crime thing turns wrongly he get involved in the murder and lost case too. What is the end you can see this movie. The story line is interesting but when we watching movie we feel that we are missing something I mean thrill is missing. You never get tension till the end.Even though having big names here in a movie, it is not impressible. Like darkness below the lamp. And it only due to poor screenplay and presentation. There is some suspense but when it reveals you will be not surprised. First of all Anthony Hopkins is having merely 3 or 4 scenes and those were just okay not much effective as his previous many movies. Then Al Pacino, he also has a limited role and it is not powerful.. Then kung fu master, Byung-Hun Lee ( G.I. Joe :Retaliation fame) only for a wasted role although he is martial art expert. Those name could be not save this movie from falling apart. Overall movie is so average even it has a good story. Not for much recommendation."
" Cheesy movie for hammy Pacino
",0.0,0.8488,2019-06-02 00:00:00,2,"Maybe I'm alone in the world, but I've come to detest Pacino and his hammy A-A-A-CTING!!!! presence. In this case, his Froghorn Leghorn southern accent almost turned his scenes into satire comedy. Also you might notice, that any movie Pacino graces with his massive ego has the big dramatic scene at the end based solely on himself. Duhamel should stick to rom-coms - especially since he's making his career primarily as a celebrity dating tool. Hopkins? He can be charming, he can be scary - here he was just ... not there."
" Not Bad

" Satisfying thriller full of chilly characters
",0.5267,0.9817,2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,"After I saw this movie I had to marvel at how many creepy characters it had managed to assemble. There are two creepy bad guys, including a brilliant role by Sir Anthony, though I have to add that he's done similar roles many times now. Still, it has to be said that it's still a pleasure. The other creepy guy is a masterclass in restraint and presence. There are two creepy girls, one immediately so, the other, in a character development that is supreme, comes across as such thanks to a consummate performance. It's a beautifully choreographed film, great framing, great editing techniques and well above average soundscape, which gathers and rolls along with the action, leading to subdued booms upon each shock or twist. I had to duck the piece a couple of points for the inconsistencies in the plot. At one point a lawyer has no trouble illegally strolling into the home of a billionaire. There's a stab to the heart that didn't seem to bleed much or kill. At another point one wonders how the bad guy is so easily locating the good guy, then so easily overpowering him, etc. Such details are lost in the edit room, and while it's possible for one's back brain to explain them, it's irritating at certain moments, particularly as one has to pay attention to follow the plot, which occasionally jumps a little way back away from the hero's timeline. It's not too distracting from the enjoyment however, and this tense and mystery orientated thriller should easily please the viewer. Al Pacino's role is crucial, and he gives a much more restrained performance than we're used to, which is awesome, helped along by a dedicated script."

If you take Pacino and Hopkins out, you have a door stopper. Go ahead and leave the room. As I stated, I have watched a lot of movies in my day, but I have never seen one as bad as this one. If you like to waste time, watch it. If your time is valuable, don't. I am in the don't category. If you finish it, go get a drink and find a good movie to watch.

TERRIBLE from start to finish.And oh: Alive Eve, man... Alice Eve... She managed to be THE WORSE PART of the trashy film. Come on! She was like a robot. Like a zombie.

You know, when you see BW's name on a movie now, you say to yourself, ""Why does old Bruce keep making these horrible movies? Has he blown all his money on hookers and cocaine?"" Al ain't quite there yet and now that he's 78 years old, he'll probably never make it to BW's level of pathetic. This movie was bad, and it wasn't his doing. The main problem was all the zombies in the movie and this wasn't a zombie movie. You had an asian hitman zombie, a wife zombie, an ex lover zombie, a private detective zombie, and a tycoon zombie...and still not a zombie movie. Poor Al Pacino, you better talk to the director next time before you accept a movie at your age."

" Abysmal
",0.0,0.8275,2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,"I'm guessing all the money was spent on paying the two big wages, as it couldn't have been spent on script-writing. The plot, for what it is, is a well-used one, and one that is obvious from about 15 minutes in...which is what I should have given this film. Hopkins' acting is as great as usual, Pacino's not so much. But it's sad to think that two big names can't do anything at all to help what is a terrible film. The scenes are completely unbelievable (spoiler alert), and 'Ben Cahill' goes from bookish, back-room lawyer to some fancy street fighter. He also manages to evade a police raid on his home by jumping from the one side of the house that the police forgot to cover. Stupid police! 'The Accountant' somehow manages to spirit away people from hospitals and streets to his abandoned church lair (again!) that somehow still has all its electrical power on (they always do) even though all he has is his bike! Clever trick, that. But his fighting skills are no match for a bookish, back-room lawyer. I know! At the end, the attractive 'Charlotte Cahill' gives her one-minute monologue-reveal piece without blinking. I don't know why, maybe the director thought it was a good idea. A much better idea would have been not to make the film in the first place. The funniest (by that, I mean the most absurd) bit is where 'Charlotte' tells 'Ben' he smells of vodka. She's twenty feet away from him, and he's just left a girl who (we're told) is smothered in perfume...yet she manages to smell vodka! That little bit actually sums up the entire film."

Emily Hynes (Malin Akerman) is the young sexy girlfriend and employee of Dr. Denning who is urging him to leave the country. Our protagonist, Ben Cahill (Josh Duhamel) ia a lawyer who works for Charles Abrams (Al Pacino). He wins cases, but has an inside man who can hack files, i.e. doing the wrong thing for the right reason as he justifies it. His wife Charlotte (Alice Eve) is a nurse. Later we find out they lost a child due to a miscarriage. The film opens with Emily going missing, then jumping to one week earlier when Emily contacts her former boyfriend Ben Cahill with Arthur's personal files.Yes it starts out with a twist, but that is hardly a plot spoiler. There are numerous twists as this thing goes on, twists that don't make sense or have decent clues, but exist for the simple reason as if to say, see how clever we are? I felt the film would have been better if they had left off the last twist or two. Josh Duhamel was deadpan in his role and our two headliners were rather boring, although it was clear Hopkins was trying to play an evil heartless man not named Hannibal. There was enough misconduct to go around with the miscast of Josh Duhamel being the worse.Bourne girl Julia Stiles did good as a security agent, but she had a minor role.Guide: F-bomb. No sex (sorry about the plot spoiler). No nudity."

It is, however, given something of a lift by the performances of its two Oscar-winning 'guest' stars though, apart from money, what drew either Al Pacino or Anthony Hopkins to this is a mystery. Given the material they have to work with, they are both excellent but the movie is such rubbish you probably won't want to spend too much time with them and certainly no time with anyone else.

" Hitchcock Type Thriller - Well worth a Watch!
",0.5707,0.9693,2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Looks like the trolls and competitor studios decided to sink this one, which is unfortunate as it is worth a watch.
Of course if you like your films full of students that can't act, filmed on a mobile, on a budget that costs no more than a cup a coffee, using a generic poster for their film that is nothing like their film, then get some mates to write big reviews and claim it's a fantastic film ... then this film is not for you!
This film has a top notch cast, looks great and looks like a real film, great music and storyline with a few surprises.Reminded me of a Brian De Palma / Hitchcock film, has a strong opening with then a slow burner build up , but not too slow, second act gets interesting and the final act with a good few twists and good pay off , would class as a thriller rather then a drama, with scenes of violence and second half with a fast pace.
It's not something i would watch twice, but well worth watching once, don't listen to the trolls and their agendas, likely hood they probably didn't even watch it!!"

",0.0,-0.9877,2017-12-05 00:00:00,2,"This year I had misfortune to watch some really bad movies. Recent one is Geostorm - but I did not expect much from that. Here, you see 2 famous veterans among actors, some called them 2 greatest and like. And this movie is just one big mess, misfire in all levels, aspects. Everything is bad - direction, story, storytelling, editing, and yes, acting in most cases. Should we blame Al Pacino, Anthony Hopkins for bad acting, or rather director and poor script ? Actually, who invested money in this disaster of movie ? As I see, they wanted to make some noir, with twists, something what will keep viewers on edge. Huh, I almost felt asleep at about 1h. There were many scenes witch simply did not make sense, were overdone, too long - like some of motorcycle attacks. Maybe worst was scene where Pacino and Hopkins were together (only one in this mismovie) - maybe it had some sense, but was presented so poorly, and no logic at all. For the end need to mention Alice Eve - did she was on something during filming ? How she passed casting for this movie - was criteria to look doped in all scenes ? Sorry to say such things, but it was some worst acting I ever seen. Rating: 2 - just because some pictures on exhibition were good :-)"
" Good movie with a good cast, well directed and well written.
",0.8402,0.9648,2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie concept is a refreshing breeze in from about 20 years ago. Seeing these old masters so seasoned, and newer faces in roles which were once cliché feels like a good homage to ""ye olde"" 90s thrillers with the legal backdrop. Josh Duhamel was great in the old Harrison Ford role, but for his Tom Cruise running scene he needed two cuts. Tom would never have stood for that. The acting and editing was nuanced and stimulating. It felt like everyone knew they were in a movie with Anthony Hopkins. Nobody phoned it in, not even Pacino. You could feel that all the players really bought into the project. It was a pleasure to watch. Pour the wine, kick off your shoes, enjoy."
" it's official - I'm going crazy
",-0.34,-0.0253,2017-08-31 00:00:00,7,"I'm embarrassed to say I actually liked this film.Let me say up front, despite some of the reviews here, I had no trouble following it.I also admit I did figure most of it out. This, however, did not keep me from being entertained.I am surprised Pacino and Hopkins signed on for this as neither role is especially great.Someone, somewhere, greenlit this thing and gave it a decent budget, even though it's a first-time director (Shintaro Shimosawa).The story concerns am ambitious young man, Ben Cahill (Josh Duhamel) who goes after fraud perpetrated by a pharmaceutical company owned by Arthur Denning (Anthony Hopkins). Cahill has been cutting corners to make his cases all along; this one is no different, as he obtained the information illegally from an old girlfriend (Malin Akerman). Ben's boss (Al Pacino) gives him the go-ahead to pursue it.Things unravel pretty quickly, as Ben is threatened not only with danger to himself but his wife (Alice Eve); he finds his ex- girlfriend dead and goes on the run.Okay, I happen to think this was an excellent plot clumsily handled by this director, who maybe should have started with something simpler. This is a very complex story to put across, and while some of the camera angles are interesting and I would say this man has talent, it wasn't put together quite right. He tried for a Pulp Fiction thing that didn't quite come off, for one thing; and for another it's just too all over the place.Another problem is that every suspense or mystery movie nowadays has to end with a twist since Usual Suspects. Well, now the twists are expected and passe, so what writers are doing now are putting twists within the twists. It's too much. The acting was okay, but the husband-wife thing between Alice Eve and Duhamel was sketchy and not fleshed out. Not sure who to blame there.Nevertheless, this was a good rental - not sure how I would have felt with these big names attached if I had paid $12 in the theater."
" Great Actors, story a little blah, the twists saved it!
",0.7955,0.8762,2017-07-17 00:00:00,6,"With talent like Pacino and Hopkins I was expecting something stellar. What you get in sections is rather lukewarm, but other parts of the movie are on fire! In the end the twists of the movie are what saved it. The film makers leave you guessing until the very end and even then they pull a double twist that makes your jaw drop. Could have been better, but if you like the actors worth a rental."

This movie however is absolutely awful and there was nothing either of these actors could have done to have made it better. The plot is terrible and the whole flow of the movie is dreadfully let down by poor amateur production, screenplay and direction. In the right hands and with the same actors it could have been such a good movie."
" How did Pacino and Hopkins get signed into this disaster. Do they need a paycheck that badly?
",-0.8391,0.7576,2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"WHAT A MESS. The plot made no sense, the scenes were incomplete, there was little continuity, the dialog was written by an eighth grader.There were so many technical flaws that it boggles the mind these did not get fixed. Just a few out of a thousand: a bunch of cops standing around silently with loaded weapons waiting for a conversation in a restaurant to end; cops entering a home but not guarding the exit through a bathroom window; the hero patching up a very large bleeding cut across his stomach with superglue; the hero and his wife each killed two people but walk happily into the sunset at the end of the movie. How could anyone in his right mind invest $-millions to make this trash.Getting parts in Hollywood must be getting hard to come by, but actors like Hopkins and Pacino don't come cheap. Truth be told, the only reason to see this movie is to watch Pacino and Hopkins. You can give these veterans absolute gibberish to say and do (as in this movie), and they still manage to make it interesting. This was released as VOD to Netflix...shame on Netflix."
" Warning: Watching this can be hazardous for your health
",-0.34,-0.9824,2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"I like refrigerator movies. Hitchcock called the serviceable thrillers that because while they were very entertaining to watch, after you go home and are going through the refrigerator, you start to pick apart the plot. In case of Misconduct, you might as well carry a portable refrigerator because you start picking the plot apart while watching it!Some good direction and clever plotting can help cover a deeply flawed movie to an extent. This movie however is extremely tone deaf. There is no sense of directorial style. There is an insulting use of non- linear chronology which serves no purpose other than to hide the fact that the plot is paper thin. It goes without saying that Al Pacino and Sir Anthony Hopkins are legends. They can make Troll 3 at this point and their legacy won't be hurt. Well maybe a little bit, but they are still legends. But this movie wastes their talents especially Hopkins who seems like he is waiting to cash in his check. Pacino gets a scene to go bombastic but you just don't care and just feel sad for the guy. Josh Duhamel tries but the ridiculous script defeats him. The standout is Alice Eve who gives the worst performance I have ever seen in a big budget movie. There is emotionally distant and there is whatever the hell Eve was going for. I was in a flight and looking for a quick movie to kill the time but this movie despite a promising start, completely goes off the rails and ends up being a waste. There is a scene about 70% into the movie where Hopkins and Pacino are on-screen, for the first time EVER...and you just don't give a damn! That is all you need to know about this junk."
" very banal plot
",0.0,-0.9979,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Conspiracy - Conspiracy is an American thriller directed by Shintaro Shimosawa, the producer of The Grudge. It was released in Italy on June 15 and in the cast are Al Pacino and Anthony Hopkins both won the Oscar and this is their first film together. The original title of the film is Misconduct - ""Conspiracy"" there we invented us in Italy - and talks about Ben Cahill, an ambitious young lawyer played by Josh Duhamel, who is in the midst of a struggle between a prominent lawyer (Pacino) and the leader of a corrupt pharmaceutical company (Hopkins). Cahill gets the incriminating documents to the pharmaceutical company and speaks to the character played by Pacino. Bad things happen and Cahill must find out the truth or lose everything he has. It looks nice. According to virtually all written reviews about the movie, it is not.In his early days in Italian Conspiracy - The conspiracy was among the five most popular films and grossed more than 50 thousand euro: a fair result, considering that it is the weekly day of June. And it is a better result than what the film has had in the US, where it grossed around 24 thousand dollars, and especially in the UK, where in its first weekend in theaters - one in which the films are usually most their collections - has grossed nearly 100 pounds (125 euro). There was a second weekend because the film was withdrawn from sale. Conspiracy - Conspiracy has cost around 10 million euro; Variety wrote that was screened in five British films and in each of them received about 25 euro: it means that on average the film has been seen by 4-5 people in each UK cinemas where it was shown. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Conspiracy - The conspiracy is ""a predictable and forgettable film"" and that the great days of Hopkins and Pacino are according to him long gone. Stephen Holden of The New York Times was more lenient with Pacino and Hopkins - ""go to their usual pace"" and one wonders how they were deceived to get them to act in the film - but is equally ruthless with the film, which is ""made by a director and the writers who usually worked in low-budget horror movie ""and it shows,"" is ridiculously clumsy, mounted in a senseless, incomprehensible, no suspense, is a film in which one of the bad guys continually invests people with a motorcycle"". Tim Robey of the Telegraph wrote that Conspiracy - Conspiracy ""is the worst movie that Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino have done in their careers"": Robey said he had seen the films considered the worst made by the two actors - ""I saw Instinct - Instinct primordial, Jack and Jill, 88 minutes, and Premonitions The rite and none of these is a film that I would like to have seen ""- but no one is still able to gamble with conspiracy - conspiracy in terms of ugliness. Robey gave the film one star out of five. The same rating given by the Guardian, whose critic Wendy Ide wrote that it is ""terrible"" and is a big stain on Hopkins curriculum and Pacino. It could be shown in film schools as a practical example of how not to make a film. Every decision is wrong: whether it's the plot, casting, photography, sound and probably even the canteen menus during filming. [...] The director, Shimosawa, is fond of harmful and slow camera movements, which eventually will stop at innocuous things, such as a refrigerator. The soundtrack is thunderously stupid. And the plot is so muddled that one wonders if anyone actually read the script before giving the green light to funding for the film. It does a little 'hard to find but there is also a positive review for Conspiracy - Conspiracy: is written by Chuck Wilson of Village Voice. It's a little 'tangled and sometimes wonder if it's ironic, and perhaps it is: Wilson writes that ""it is a pity that the film was snubbed"" because the debut of Shimosawa director has a ""elegant visual style and a plot full so many and so absurd twists that the film becomes an appreciable melodrama. "" Wilson writes that the film ""makes us think of Brian De Palma's Carrie Vintage - The look of Satan and Dressed to Kill"" and ""there are beautiful, long and straight shots in which the camera goes even further than the actors, as if trying another turning point in the plot. "" Wilson adds that all this might seem like something that disturbs and confuses, it is not: ""It is talented,"" and the director ""should start organizing meetings for his next film."" The only place they seem to agree with Wilson is South Korea, where Conspiracy - Conspiracy grossed just under a million Euros."
