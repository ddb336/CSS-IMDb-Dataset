" The Duel is a flawed western that might not work for everyone but I liked it, the two leads shine throughout the film
",0.5719,0.9871,2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"The Duel is a Western film directed by Kieran Darcy-Smith and written by Matt Cook. The story follows David Kingston, a Texas Ranger who investigates a series of unexplained deaths in a town called Helena, where he hides his identity from the preacher and mayor Abraham Brant whom killed his father 20 years prior to the events of the movie.The film stars Liam Hemsworth as David Kingston and Alice Braga as Marisol Kingston whilst Woody Harrelson portrays Abraham Brant and Emory Cohen plays Isaac Brant. The two leads, Liam and Woody are great in their roles, giving their best to the screen. The others are also pretty good, nothing wrong with the acting.But why did the film get such bad reviews and low score on IMDB? I believe it's because of how dark and gritty it is and how it isn't historically accurate, the movie is also slow paced and has meaningful dialogue above action, but when action hits it hits hard.But my honest opinion is that it's a nice looking film that placed two great actors against each other and it made for some entertaining and well done drama. It's worth watching, for the cinematography and acting, I also found the story to be quite well and the characters were well written."

Would've been awesome as your typical vengeance western, but hollywood just had to turn this into typical anti white, anti Christian, ""woke"" propaganda.

Standard operational procedure.If you enjoy a movie where the good guy has a great heart and the bad guy is a conniving scumbag then it is worth a viewing. Good storyline. As usual Woody can play a twisted, evil, character, after all he was spawned from one. Hemsworth handles his character with dignity and fortitude. Solid for a streamlined cast."

Character motivations don't make much sense throughout, but I gave up caring somewhere around the hour mark. I'm giving it 5/10 cos Harrelson is always fun to watch, but I suspect I just wasted 2 hours on a stinker. I really can't tell, cos production values are excellent throughout but I wouldn't recommend this oater to anyone."
" Needs a banjo....

When he and his wife (Alice Braga) arrive, he discovers the town under the leadership of the spookily evil/charming preacher ""Abraham"" (Woody Harrelson) who almost immediately makes him the town's new sheriff. What follows is a sort of psychological game of chess between the two as they size each other up and as Hemsworth, his wife and his investigation all start to get embroiled in quite a cunning game of cat and mouse with Harrelson, his son and henchmen. Sadly, though, the promise isn't matched by the delivery. Harrelson has, too many times, tried to portray the evil, borderline fruitcake, baddie and Hemsworth just hasn't got the presence on the screen to carry it off as his challenger. The less said about the dialogue the better and the direction clearly had a mandate to extend the $10m budget to film as much screen time as possible, regardless of it's quality. It does, briefly, have something of ""Deliverance"" (1972) about it..."

Only thing that really annoyed me was that David in the end from his ambush shot one of the losers first instead of the main villain and then just taking care of the rest. But on the other hand most of the movies do not make the logical decision in such moments ;-)"

This time but I don't fault Harrelson because the screen play was really bad. And the directing was even worse. 72% of the cast should go back to class. Cinematography was good but many of the shot set ups wasn't. Perhaps worse of all, the director probably did an even worse job on the editing. I'd like to give this movie -5."
" Disappointing film with good moments
",-0.0772,-0.948,2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,"About halfway through I told my wife I'd turn it off but I wanted to see what was going to happen. The camera work was pretty good. The setting would disappoint anyone who has been in South or West Texas because that's nowhere near how it looks there. It was filmed in Mississippi. Not an ideal substitute.
Liam Hemsworth did an almost adequate job..Please, I mean no offense to actors from other countries but aren't there native born actors who could handle the dialog a little more naturally? I felt Hemsworth's American accent to be contrived as though he was carefully avoiding his natural Australian accent. He looked right for the part but whether it's his acting style or the director's oversight, he often came across as unintelligent due to his reluctance to speak yet from other scenes we know he is well spoken. A script adjustment might have helped.
Woody Harrelson's character was superficial to the point of being paper thin. The fancy cliche villain is an old gimmick that I, for one, am very tired of seeing. He managed to portray the villain who thinks all the time staying several moves ahead of everyone. Harrelson's facial expressions were good and being a native Texan he had no problems with accent although the pomposity was over the top. The script wasn't his fault. He tends to do well in this type of role so were it not for the script and the underachieving direction, his performance could have been notable.
Alice Braga had a minor role but handled it well in an even performance.
All in all, I'm not sorry to have watched it but it isn't one I would recommend."
" Can it get worse?
",-0.4767,-0.97,2020-02-07 00:00:00,2,"There is nothing in this film to recommend it, but perhaps it is the acting that is the worst aspect. It's hard to decided who did the worst job, but probably it is Woody Harrelson. Then there's the script, which is not merely lacking interest, but steals a plot from other films set at a time when it's not appropriate (I can't say any more w/o revealing the plot). The music is funky to say the least and the direction is without tension. Don't waste 90 minutes of your life."

" Revenge Western

Mexican citizens have gone missing in the area and the Texas Governor sends Texas Ranger Kingston (Liam Hemsworth) to investigate, The complication is that Brant killed Kingston's father in a duel twenty years before. A tale of racism, revenge, ethnic cleansing and downright horror with some really disturbing scenes. Truly a Savage Western. Good acting by Hemsworth and Harrelson along with Alicie Brage as Marisol, Kingston's conflicted wife and Felicity Price as Naomi, a prostitute who is desperate to escape from Mount Hermon. Directed by Kieran Darcy-Smith. 7/10. On Netflix."

",-0.2263,-0.973,2019-09-22 00:00:00,4,"The story may be predictable, but Harrelson goes all in as the deranged preacher, and it's a pleasure to watch, whether he's wiggling his eyebrow tattoos or horseback riding around town, dressed in an all-white suit. On the other side, Hemsworth stays monotonous, even if it unravels the lethal secrets of the city (which, once uncovered, turns this Western into more of a horror flick).Watching the secret horrors of the city turn David into a morally loose and bloodthirsty ranger, seeking revenge, should be intriguing. Rather, the emotionless performance of Hemsworth (and a gloomy subplot about the inexplicable descent into insanity of his wife) means that this Western scattershot misses its mark."

He is rugged, intelligent and slimy in this one, nearly spooky. I had never seen Liam Helmsworth in anything. He is a good actor, but it is hard to get passed the ""good looking"" part....like Brad Pitt in Troy, just too pretty to pull it off. And it was a nice surprise to see another, younger Braga family member on film...they are a talented bunch. It was an entertaining movie, not a hard hitter, nothing profound or think-inducing.

" ""Do you not fear the eternal hell that awaits you?""
",-0.3964,0.8863,2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,"I fully expected this film to have a relatively low IMDb rating (5.8 as I write this), but I thought it was a pretty good Western. One thing I need to clear up from the movie's title page here on IMDb and also touched on by a number of reviewers, was the location of the main story. It opened with a scene taking place in 1846 in Helena, Texas, which is where some viewers believe the rest of the tale took place. But twenty two years later, the focus shifts to the town of Mount Hermon where Abraham Brant (Woody Harrelson) holds sway as the town boss and it's loquacious preacher. I guess it doesn't make a difference in the grand scheme of things, but I like to be accurate about these things.Part of the plot here appears to be based on the 1932 film ""The Most Dangerous Game"", itself based on a short story of the same name by Richard Connell in 1924. That has to do with the fact that Preacher Abraham is running a hunting camp for foreign adventurers who want to know what it's like to kill people. The prey consists of captured Mexicans who are held in a cage, separated from their families, and left starving until the hunt is about to begin. Sounds a bit like a political statement being made here but who am I to judge, it didn't appear like any of them were requesting asylum. Assigned the task of discovering what's happened to missing Mexicans along the border, Texas Ranger David Kingston goes undercover with an assumed name, going by Locke. Taking his wife along under duress, David initially gains Abraham's favor and is made town sheriff, though it's later revealed that Abraham knew David's real identity as the son of a man that the Preacher killed in an arm strapped duel back in 1846 Helena.There are some interesting elements that pop up in the story, like Abraham's branding of a town prostitute (Felicity Price) with the letter 'A' on her thigh indicating that he 'owns' her, and Abraham's fascination with snake handling during his call to Jesus sermons. Playing it safe, Abraham doesn't use serpents of a poisonous variety like some modern day Pentecostals, he's content to handle what looks like a collection of corn snakes and milk snakes, quite colorful I might add, and actually beneficial to keep a rodent population down. There's also a rather clever twist in the story that blows by quickly and isn't highlighted, and that's the idea that David knew Spanish the entire time Abraham was warning him with a threat to his life. Not very savvy of Abraham there, knowing that Davis was married to a Mexican wife (Alice Braga).That last point was probably the most underdeveloped part of the story. It seemed that part of Marisol's (Braga) discontent with her husband was based on the fact that her own father 'gave' her to David right before dying. She fell under Abraham's evil eye while disadvantaged with some mysterious ailment, and it leaves a big question mark at the end of the story as to the resolution of her marital relationship. Not so for the fate of The Preacher. Again, with a little bit of a twist, Abraham has his own come to Jesus moment in a final showdown with David. You might say that the evil town boss found himself caught between a rock and a hard place."

His wife takes ill and is seduced I guess by the preacher and goes into his concubine of wife's. No explanation of why she leaves her husband and goes to the preacher. At first I thought he sent her to him to draw him back to the preacher. But then the preacher seemed to exerciser her in her illness almost brainwashing her.

Nothing about them or the story is even remotely plausible, not even within the limits of their own fictional world. The female characters (if you can call such automatons characters) are rolled on and off-screen like props, supplying the flimsiest excuses for more violence of one kind or another. One wonders how such things ever manage to get made in the first place.

Most of the actors seemed professional and physically appeared as we might expect people from the late 19thC old west might appear, that is with the exception of bald headed, slow talking (Mr. I'm thinking ahead before I speak) Woody Harrelson. Deep thinking, lost in thought, is not what comes to mind when I think of Woo-D.

Sometimes you see a painting where it is not the content that catches your eye, but the way that it is painted. I would say that i have that experience with this movie: a well crafted piece of art. The acting is superb, the sound, music and scenery fit well together and create the perfect atmosphere for this story. Not a complex or spectacular story, but intriguing, and beautifully painted. Absolutely a must see for those who appreciate quality."

" Contemporary Western with social theme
",0.0,0.7845,2018-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Western movies are few and far between these days. So when a Western does appear I take the time to watch them. Generally, the stories are not the simple 'black and white' good versus evil or cowboys versus Indians plots of the past. Instead, viewers are fed with more complicated stories with fewer set piece gunfights. The Duel is no exception. It has some great acting by Woody Harrelson though the other main actor's performance, i.e. Liam Hemsworth, is acceptable at best. The story has an underlying social message relevant to today's far right Christian movement about discrimination and xenophobia. At times the plot moves slowly and the film could do with more action. Nonetheless, for fans of Western movies The Duel is eminently watchable."
" Boring but with a Message
",-0.1655,0.5019,2018-03-17 00:00:00,5,"This film seems really clean. Not implying it's a 'family film', or anything, just that everyone and everything seems so brand new and clean. Even the raggedy clothes Hemsworth wears in the beginning look as if they're brand new and he just ripped it in places to make it look raggedy. Some characters have dirty faces but their clothes are immaculately clean. I've seen hundreds of Westerns and this is the first that has given me this perception.It's not a fast-paced film. The beginning (while raining) with Harrelson and a group of people get into an argument (or what not), and someone ends up dead with the cliché child (etc.,) sad by the dead body who (most likely) is a parent of his. After that scene, it moves extremely slow. Unforgiven (1992) was like that but the difference between that film and this one was the dialogue was vastly more interesting in Unforgiven.The story: people are disappearing on the Texas/Mexico border. Hemsworth is hired by the Governor to find the culprit(s) responsible. Hemsworth plays a Texas Ranger. Texas Rangers were the first official border patrol agency. Harrelson plays a cult preacher, Pentecostal most likely (snakes, speaking in tongues.) and he is to be feared. He's, apparently, the quiet kind of evil; perhaps with passive-aggressive tendencies; calculated (in his mind) to be that way. I didn't find anything interesting in this film. It kept my attention (most of the time) but that isn't necessarily enough for a film. There's got to be some sort of interest to grab one, right? I did initially watch this because I enjoy Woody Harrelson films but this film just doesn't go anywhere; or it goes somewhere but takes too long to get there. The overall acting is fine, the direction is fine, etc., is fine. The story is just boring; or told boringly. Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is difficult to figure out (probably not meant to be) but in today's US, maybe it's a picture of our future rather than our past."

I wonder if it's the lighting, the sets, or the camera work. The pacing is lethargic. Woody does his work. Liam isn't bad in this. I'm not sure I understand what happened to Marisol.

But Harrelson overacts every scene and uses the annoying stereotyped mush-mouth drawl that made ""The Cowboy Way"" so unwatchable. His ""Abraham"" is presented as a sort of cult leader who appears to have healing powers and can cure sickness with a single touch. Hemsworth is Texas Ranger ""David"" and has a wife who immediately falls sick in Abraham's town and Abraham begins to tend to her a little too much. David notes that there are no Mexicans in the border town only to find that Abraham hates them, captures them and sells them to hunters who delight in tracking and killing them. Which fails to explain why Abraham is infatuated with David's wife, who is Mexican. We also never learn why she is infatuated with the crazed Abraham. Nor is the issue of Abraham's faith healing ever revisited in the film. It's as if by the second half of the film the writer forgot he put that in the first half. Ultimately David is forced to be hunted but given a rifle and bullets to make it interesting for the hunters. His first move is to shoot the man guarding the next batch of captured Mexicans and free them. But it never occurs to the Ranger to take the gun and ammo of that guard so he eventually runs out of bullets. And after he resolves the situation, the wounded Ranger rides off into the sunset (instead of returning to Ranger HQ) leaving his confused wife behind in the town we are subsequently told was abandoned.

Woody Harrelson is absolutely perfect as the head of a religious cult. Liam Hemsworth is fine as the somewhat amoral protagonist and his wife Alice Bragga does a fine job though either of the two could have been replaced by someone else but they are not bad. The story depends on atmosphere and they do a good job on that from beginning to end. The problem is if you go into it expecting a shoot em up tale of good and evil you will be disappointed. If you want to see a weird tale with strange twists that no one would have in 1950 this is your movie. More for those who like the twilight zone than John Wayne.

",-0.4633,0.6832,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"'THE DUEL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A western starring Woody Harrelson and Liam Hemsworth; 'THE HUNGER GAMES' costars, and vegan buddies (Harrelson, a vegan of 30-years, convinced Hemsworth to adapt the important philosophy)! It tells the story of a Texas Ranger, in the 1880s, that's sent to a frontier town in order to investigate some local murders there, and missing people. The movie also costars Alice Braga and Emory Cohen. It was directed by actor, turned director, Kieran Darcy-Smith, and it was scripted by Matt Cook; who also co-wrote 2016's 'PATRIOT'S DAY' and 'TRIPLE 9' (also costarring Harrelson). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it was only released in indie theaters at the Box Office (It also got a video on demand release). I enjoyed it.Several people have gone missing, and several have turned up dead as well, near the border in the 1880s. A Texas Ranger, named David Kingston (Hemsworth), is sent to an old frontier town to investigate. His wife, Marisol (Braga), accompanies him. Once there, the couple meets a mysterious preacher, named Abraham Brant (Harrelson). Brant, and his ruthless son Isaac (Cohen), seem to be controlling all of the people in the town there (somehow). It's of course up to Kingston to stop them. The movie is really dark, bizarre, and brutally violent; all good things in a western! Harrelson and Hemsworth are both good in their roles (and I don't always like Hemsworth), and the story is pretty interesting. The film does begin a little slow-paced, but it definitely picks up towards the ending. I definitely enjoyed it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
