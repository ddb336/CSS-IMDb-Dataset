" Abrams' Trek 3: Behind
",0.0,-0.9962,2021-04-01 00:00:00,2,"Once more unto the breach, my friends. Here we have yet another swing at a Star Trek film from the Bad Robot team, and another miss by a cosmic mile. Not that I expected anything else from Abrams and the assorted geniuses he drags around with him. Everybody seemed to love this particular blend of high-adrenaline, low-cerebration katzenjammer the first two times; why should the producers even try to raise the bar anywhere with this one? This film delivered exactly what I knew it would, and that's more of the same: MORE dumb plots that bash your disbelief beyond all decency; MORE stupid bravado from angsty numbskulls who have no business commanding a starship; MORE gigantic explosions and blaring lights and deafening klaxons; MORE forgettable villains who exist solely to provide aforementioned explosions; MORE ill-conceived, irreverent comedy better befitting Douglas Adams than Gene Roddenberry; and for me as a discontented Trekkie, MORE of that painful, deep-seated apathy that I feel when looking over this once-proud IP. The only genuine surprise ""Beyond"" gave me is that Abrams didn't direct it. And no, Michael Bay didn't either, though you could have fooled me.Big Generic Bad Guy, some alien named Krall, is seeking revenge against the Federation. Krall was once a human named Balthazar Edison, but after his ship became stranded on an unknown planet, he and his crew mutated themselves with abandoned alien technology to survive (Where'd the technology come from? Who made it? Who abandoned it? Who cares?). Krall is a warrior and hates the Federation because of how pacifistic they've become; he dreams of one day sparking an interstellar conflict with the... oh, why bother? Krall combines the illogical plotting of Nero with the pointless warmongering of Marcus, meaning that Krall is basically everything wrong with the first two Abrams' Trek villains distilled into one. Twice the suck for half the price.After luring the Enterprise into an uncharted nebula, Krall unleashes a swarm of robots that tear the flagship apart. Oh dear, the Enterprise has been destroyed... again. I remember the first time that happened, back in the REAL Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. After all that ship had been through, seeing it blow up meant something, and seeing Kirk's reaction to watching his charge go down in fiery glory meant something, too. Now, the previous two reboots have already done it. Destroying the Enterprise is practically a part of the daily routine. Yawn.The film's attempts to give its characters depth pack all the emotional punch of a wet sock. Kirk is beginning to question his place as captain, wondering where his life is going and what good all his efforts have done. This is basically the same arc Kirk went through back in Wrath of Khan (because the writers hadn't plundered that movie enough yet!). A mid-life crisis was fitting for a character who was, you know, in the middle of his life, but this new Kirk is still practically a teenager. It's not like his best years are behind him or anything. This new self-reflection makes little sense, especially given how much of a reckless punk he's been until now - and still is, actually. Meanwhile, Spock and Uhura have broken up (yay!), only to hook back up in the end (yay). Don't you just love cyclical soap opera drama? This isn't how you give characters depth, but it may give the illusion of depth to viewers who aren't really paying attention.The slapdash storyline contains its fair share of head-scratching inanity, par for the course for ""Abrams' Trek."" Kirk's stranded crew finds a derelict starship that has been rotting on a far-flung planet for over a century. In no time at all, they have it flying again. Sure, why not? Krall commands a swarm of deadly space drones that rip starships apart like piranhas. Where'd this swarm come from? How'd Krall find it? Why do the drones obey Krall? I don't know. Oh, and get this: turns out the swarm is super-sensitive to high-frequency sound, so Kirk defeats them by... blasting them with a Beastie Boys track. Is there any purer sign that these ""Abrams' Trek"" films were never intended for true Trekkies, but for careless millennials, and that the writers are desperate to throw in ANYTHING that may appeal to that demographic?Defenders will no doubt claim that the problem here is with me: this is what Star Trek is now, and if I can't get over myself and accept it, then I'm not welcome anymore. ""This ain't your daddy's Star Trek"" was the 2009 film's official tagline, after all. But stop right there, my hypothetical objector, because you don't get to play that way. Star Trek is an already-established property. It became the cultural cornerstone that it is thanks to years of dedicated hard work from hundreds of different people: artists and actors and writers who had stories to tell, a vision to inspire. If Paramount didn't want to meet the Star Trek standard, then they could have simply launched a new IP, with a new, blank slate fresh for the taking. But no: that's hard work. They wanted a safe, stalwart name that they knew came prepacked with its own fanbase. You think you're allowed to just steal someone else's creation, bash down all their work, replace it with your mindless bilge, and we, the old guard who kept this IP warm all these years, are just supposed to blindly go along with it!?Make no mistake: these movies are NOT Star Trek. They never were, and never will be. Good news is, you DON'T have to accept it. The original Star Trek remains, and as long as we remember it, it will never die. Let Abrams and his ilk boldly keep going where Michael Bay has gone before, as the returns diminish and the prospect of further sequels grows ever dimmer. I'll take the REAL Star Trek. May Roddenberry's vision live long and prosper."

",-0.4767,-0.5859,2021-02-19 00:00:00,1,"The dialog and motivations were terrible. Motivations were unreal. Although the visuals were nice, the physics were bad even for Star Trek."
" Space Garbage

" Snow Globe in Space?
",0.0,0.9806,2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Star Trek Beyond is the third film of the new reboot with the entire cast returning to boldly go where no man has gone before. The crew of the Enterprise finds themselves in another uncharted piece of space where they encounter a reptile like human species that ends up being the long lost crew of U.S.S. Franklin headed by Idris Elba. The storyline finds Enterprise destroyed again, I mean how many times can the infamous ship by blown to pieces. At least with Star Wars the Falcon is repairable with Trekkies they have to restart from scratch much like this one. The only good thing that came out of this one was the tribute to the previous crew and a mention of Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Anton Yelchin who played Chekhov. The acting was subpar but the action sequences were fun to watch. The story was co-written by Scotty (Simon Pegg) which it was not bad but it just felt like a thirty minute television episode prolonged into a two hour no nonsense film. I believe Abrams loves Greg Grunberg, yet another movie he plays a cameo and what's up with that city in space which looks like a giant snow globe or an upgraded Deep Space Nine. I loved the music each Trek movie has a unique melody. Overall good movie to watch, but I wouldn't remember this one."
" True to JJ-form
",0.4215,0.25,2021-02-02 00:00:00,4,"Somehow this is an even worse Star Trek movie than his first two attempts. I mean, it's fine to watch as long as you're not expecting anything Star Trek and you're looking for a generic action film in a comfortable sci-fi setting."
" The New Trek 3
",0.0,0.9736,2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Why has Greg Grunberg been in every movie I've watched recently? Is there some secret, cross platform algorithm promoting the works of Grunberg? Why is it only targeting me now? These questions and more as I watch Star Trek Beyond... Finally!Kidding aside though, I have a somewhat contentious relationship with these films that always makes it hard for me to properly rate or review them. Beyond ends up being no different than the previous films in the, I believe it's called the Kelvin Timeline? What it boils down to it simple. I am not a big Trek fan. I have watched a lot of Star Trek though, for someone that doesn't really care for it, in the hope of one day finding the magic key that makes it all click into place for me. Regardless of the film, for the most part, I find myself enjoying an exceptional cast and a less than exceptional story. Like I said, Beyond was the exact same way to me. The cast is incredible, that's nothing new really but this universe just doesn't click with me at all. I don't like it, I don't connect with it and thus it's hard for me to really find myself invested in anything going on. I do give this one props for the subject matter it's going for and there was a really awesome musical space battle that, while probably super manufactured in reality, absolutely worked for me and provided one of the best space battle sequences of the series.So, final verdict? Trek movies generally start as pretty middling to me. Meh story offset by incredible casting. I give this one a little extra bump because there were some solid sequences here and they were going for something that sorta worked. Also, Iris Elba is amazing, I felt like he wasn't perfectly used here but that man brings gravitas as easy as he breathes so it works. All in all, it's an above average film, but one I can't really recommend to most people unless you've at least watched the two before it and I don't think it's worth checking out the previous ones just to watch this so it winds up being decent for fans and that's about it. Fun stuff."
" I favor Star Trek, not Star Wars
",0.6832,0.5241,2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,"Star Trek has always been my favorite, but this movie is complete garbage. The writers are complete crap. The script is terrible. The direction is terrible. The casting is OK, except for Uhura. The special effects are OK. The physics are god awful. Next time get someone from NASA to explain how space flight works. YOU CAN NOT FLY IN OUTERSPACE LIKE AN AIRPLACE YOU !@#$$% MORONS!I won't get further in to details because it isn't worth my time. This is a complete mess of stupid. The original story, the original television show, is about humanity and learning how to deal with meeting different species. Learning new relationships. And yeah, I know the acting and special effects on the original show sucked, but this movie is worse. It tries to be more by adding more, but it is less because it forgot what the original show was trying to teach."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.8757,2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Reading reviews on here, I feel I should start mine with letting you all know that I'm in no way Star Trek fan with any amount of knowledge of either its universe (this is my first ST movie) nor science. With that out of the way, allow me to tell you all to chill.Sure, this isn't a great movie with a potential to become a classic, but don't sit there and pretend that it doesn't do what movies are supposed to do - amuse you. And if you are not some hardcore Star Trek or sci-fi fan (because apparently movie fails on both fronts), and you are just looking for something to watch to kill time, this movie was made for you. It has everything: pretty actors running around, witty comebacks, characters find themselves in some pretty serious problems but, in the end, there is a happy ending so it's all good. Not to mention, it all happens in less than 2 hours.The only flaw is the villain. Oh God, this movie would be so much better if he was more competent one. Or, better yet, if there was no villain at all and we spent two hours watching them trying to reach home from far away planet."
" Money not well spent
",-0.2057,0.4753,2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Pure profiteering, industrial movie for the cinema complex idea that is rapidly fading right now. Horrible to suffer this garbage as I grew up on the original. This is tripe of the highest expensive order, a machine made production with nothing to redeem it anywhere, save some pretty looking aliens. This is science fiction and definitely not art. Yuck and yuck!"
" The first two were better
",0.4404,0.9864,2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"This is the least from the three ST movies for me. Still a great cast, still good chemistry, but a lesser storyline. And...After reading the negative comments of the first movies here on IMDb, I must admit that there is a point to them. In these movie series, the whole science is gone, which made the series so great. I'm not a big adapt of the original series, but one could imagine a more truthful adaptation of the series by putting more emphasis on exploration, discovery and the implementation of science.
Put aside that, these movies are still solid. Although, Beyond has some moments where it gets a bit difficult to stay in the Star Trek dream. The introduction of the motorbike and it's obvious use was a bit too much for me. But again, very entertaining and I love the honouring of the deceased Yelchin."
" Watched again 4+ years later. Had managed to forget the stupid stuff.
",-0.6486,-0.5549,2021-01-18 00:00:00,3,"I love the new Star Trek cast. Top to bottom, I think they're fantastic. They do great here. And the dialog in this movie is on par with the other reboot movies. The plot is not.I was wondering, re-watching this, why I remembered less about this movie than the 1st two reboots. I also wondered whether JJ Abrams directed it. (He was a producer, not a director). The high-level of destruction that starts out the movie -- almost so high as to be depressing, is what you might see in an Abrams. But the unparalleled stupidity of the ending is exactly what you hire Abrams to avoid. It is Jar-Jar level dumbness that can tank a whole franchise. And, four years later, they should be hoping people forget. This is a hide-in-the-vault-and-pretend-it-never-happened sequel."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,0.4767,2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,I love the first two Star Trek remakes. This... this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
" Oh dear
",0.3818,-0.6369,2021-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Lots of action, zero plot.
There's an alien whose army is unbeatable ....until Captain Kirk appears on a motorbike. Seriously?
It's like the Star Wars franchise in that there are so many films and TV series that they just blend into one.
Put Star Trek out of it's misery please. Let this be the last one."
" dumb! bad story drowned in special effects
",-0.8516,0.9368,2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Good and charismatic actors and expensive quality special effects, but one-dimensional ""evil"" characters, shallow side-characters, unrealistic and boring hare-brained action sequences without any function in moving the story forward, and really dumb flat plot that fails to creat any atmosphere or ""world building"". Just one boring CGI-stuffed action sequence after the other.. yawn!the original star trek movies had much more wit, charm, and better stories!
are there no more good story writers in Hollywood? The studios should invest more in good & intelligent stories instead of just blowing out millions of dollars on computer effects! less fireworks, mor brains please!"
" Thought I would never watch this.
",0.0,-0.5859,2021-01-04 00:00:00,5,"After ST Into Darkness was so screamingly awful, I thought I would never watch this film. When I got home from ID, I watched Space Seed again to make sure I was right, that a low budget episode of the originally series really was 100 times better than this high budget monstrosity of a film. I was right. It left me angry. So angry it took me 4 years to watch this one and then only because I was streaming it for free.I also figured out a different way to approach it. I decided to think about this as not the Star Trek that shares a timeline with The Original Series, but one that shares a time line with Star Wars: A New Hope. I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, so I don't expect as much as I do from Star Trek. It had a few of the elements I expect from Star Trek, so it was not as much of a train wreck as Into Darkness. It had some ridiculous plot holes and technological mistakes, like using an archaic transporter to do things you could never do with the more advanced ones in TOS. But I'm forgetting, I'm supposed to be considering these Star Wars transporters, so it doesn't apply. So, you see, the movie can work better if it isn't Star Trek. So, call it Star Trek: A New Hope Beyond. It was OK."
" Star Trek Beyond the Pale... I wonder?
",0.0,0.9726,2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"Anyone remember the fun scenes in ""Galaxy Quest"" (1999) when they are on the desert planet looking for Beryllium spheres? Well much of this reminded me of that - only, well, without being funny. Drafting in Idris Elba as arch baddie ""Krall"" who is bent on the destruction of the Federation and all that it stands for - he does have an axe to grind, to be fair - is a good try, but the daft antics of Messrs. Pine, Quinto, Urban et al just falls short. The story takes far too long to develop and the script tries way too hard to be witty and clever. There really is a dearth of top quality sci-fi productions out there and when we do get them, they really must be better put together than this overly long, unchallenging, borderline moralistic, celebration of superb computer generated (and make up) artistry. The concluding sequence seems to go on for aeons! Certainly, it looks every inch the multi-million dollar budget movie but if there is to be a ""Star Trek - Further Beyond"", then please can we have writers who are not comedians with delusions of grandeur and a decent plot?"
" The new 'Star treks' are worse than the old ones.
",-0.4767,-0.4018,2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,If you take away the special effects from this movie almost nothing remains. The story is very thin and predictable. The Federation in this story is far from what it pretends to be. What makes it worse is the fact that this kind of movie has become a reference point for the new hipsters of this age.One more thing. A semi qualified captain of Enterprise is risking everyone's lives guessing and taking chances for the fun of it. He's so bored in the beginning that I almost went to sleep. After saying that the Enterprise is the most qualified vessel in the fleet the script reads a few lines later that they are actually not prepared to carry out their orders.Anyway. If you need to run something in the background while you work or read or whatever just go for it! Otherwise don't make this the focal point of your evening.
" What a wasted opportunity!
",-0.1759,-0.8338,2020-12-17 00:00:00,2,"As another lifelong Star Trek fan, I too was very disappointed and embarrassed by this film. Throughout the various series and films, I've always felt that the technology portrayed was plausible. This jumps straight to sheer fantasy, with a ridiculous story line. Simon Pegg should be ashamed!"
" Worst Costumes Ever
",-0.6249,-0.5709,2020-11-30 00:00:00,7,"The costumes are the worst ever. Absolutely ruins the movie for me, Seeing these oversized epaulets makes me laugh and takes away from this film, Minimalism has its place in this Franchise."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.8974,2020-11-27 00:00:00,4,"The movie does not really have a plot.
The villan is terrible beacause it was so poorly developed.
The whole movie kinda felt like a side story compared to the others, it does not feel like the people working on this movie tried to create something intresting and creative, they rather just threw something together. So like i sad it was pretty disappointing.So if you care about the story and was well developed new charcters i would not recommend this.If flying spaceships shooting at each other is enough to entertain you... go ahead."
" Entertaining & suspenseful
",0.4404,-0.0102,2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed the movie but thought it was really weird how Krall had this amazing technology to destroy any ships he encountered but couldn't deal with a few ragtag rebels literally a stones throw away from his base? Krall seemed to have thousands of pilots for his little spaceships but it seemed he had only a handful of troops to run/guard his base.
" A nadir for Trek.
",0.0,-0.8439,2020-11-02 00:00:00,4,This isn't Star Trek. Director Lin was so wrong for this. Worst Star Trek movie by light years.
" Fun but not Star Trek
",0.2846,-0.4988,2020-10-22 00:00:00,7,"Good fun action from a sci-fi angle, but it's not true Star Trek.It doesn't respect all that came before."
" Abysmal...
",0.0,-0.9493,2020-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Plot: Several centuries into the future, a crew of early-21st century children trapped inside adults' bodies somehow have possession of a multi-quadrillion dollar space vessel, and are on a five-year mission to explore uncharted territory in their galaxy. Per the hollyweird formula, they stop to relax for a little bit inside a gaudy rendering of computer-generated imagery, towards the beginning. After that--ACTION! Lots and LOTS of action, for its own sake, and nothing else. And...that's basically it.This film has absolutely none of the characteristics of a Star Trek film. Above all, it's supposed to engage you on some level, provoke thought, or offer some moral. The only thing that you could possibly glean from it as a ""moral of the story"" is the underlying suggestion that ""war is bad,"" based on the source of antagonism in the film. Apart from the fact that everyone already knows that, it doesn't even come across that way, anyway.I say this because of the villain. Who is this guy? Well, apparently he's a really old, really patriotic, genetically-twisted war veteran from back in the days when Starfleet was--let's say--more practical. He wants to destroy the modern peace-loving federation (you know, the one that rides around in warships ready and willing to ""keep the peace?"") for some reason or another than I don't care to remember.In any event, my point is that rather than having an anti-war message (if ANY message, at all), it comes across as propaganda, having the intent of caricaturing a certain type of citizen in society, and then demonizing said caricature. This isn't really all that strange, though, I suppose. Hollywood is known for its propaganda, after all. I mean, that's basically the only reason they exist, anymore.There really isn't much else to say apart from that the film, overall, was just a plain-and-simple disappointment, at best. It was much longer than it needed to be, the characters who seemed to be coming along in development in the past two films became lifeless between the credits of Into Darkness and the opening titles, the same characters consistently do things that make no sense, and science-fiction takes a back seat to science-fantasy. It just sucks.There is one plus, though. I don't know about you, but I spent the runs of the first two films in complete desperation. It literally kept me awake at night not knowing, but that's all at an end, because now I finally know that Sulu is gay. I can rest, peacefully..."
" A well done trek film but weakest of the reboots
",-0.5994,0.9806,2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Star Trek beyond is a fun movie with awesome action, amazing effects, great performances, lovable characters, great comedy, and great character moments (plus some good tributes). The biggest flaws are the story is weak and predictable and the villian is the most forgettable in the series with a stupid design, weird way of speaking, and a waste of Idris Elba.

Did like 'into the darkness' a bit less, but 'Beyond' was very good in my opinion. Usually I am someone whonotices continuïty errors and things like that or very illogical storylines. Of course these are here as well, but somehow it did not annoy me that much, since I just enjoyed the story and the movie as a whole. JayLah is a nce character, Simon Peg is just as funny to see as always and Chris Pine was born for his role as Jim Kirk. And Bones.... yes, he as well is funny to see.There is a smooth chemistry between the members of the core cast of this movie and that makes the movie, in spite of lesser story ingerediënts."

Count to it the fact that I saw the last movie years back. So the characters and their relationship progression is lost on me. Case in point, There appeared to be a focus on the frenemies relationship of Spock and Bones, but if it had not been explicitly mentioned by Kirk at one point, I never got that vibe out their escapades.The crew seemed to be packed with top notch geniuses of their respective fields. Impossible is just a word that they like to use/hear when accomplishing the feat with relative ease. At one point Scotty modifies cargo beam to beam out Spock and Bones, be he doesn't pick them up togther since he is not sure if they will get amalgamated. But the very next useage of the beam is to rescue crew in batches of 20!Despite having suspended my disbelief in its entirety, I still craved for something akin to a dangerous situation. Despite the high stakes and increasing risks, nothing ever seems to be at risk."

It's honestly just lazy writing and lazy plot design.There's also several other plot-holes in the movie, especially in the last 20minutes of the movie, where there's at least 3 plot-holes one-after-another. The movie up until that was pretty good, but it's like they just gave up in the last 20minutes and brought their story to a close by throwing a tonne of action scenes at the viewer and not caring about any plot-holes at all.Overall, it's an OK film, but could have been 7/10 or possibly even 8/10 if they took the time to not include all the plot-holes that they did."

I am not sure what this is 'beyond' but it lacked any genuineness and from the first minute you could pretty much tell how the film would pan out. The characters were boring and affected , and it was hard to sympathise with these posers given how uninspiringly clichéd they were. One of the great strengths of the series was the way the characters and situations were just of real life. Instead this film only managed unbelievable. A tendency towards almost fairy book style good vs. evil was especially annoying at the beginning of the film."

My absolute favorite for this one, the reason I'm probably more likely to watch this than the previous movies, is Sofia Boutella's portrayal of Jaylah: she is a great character.If nothing else, this new franchise has incredibly high production value, like there is no problem money can't fix good. The ships, the practical effects, and just general atmosphere of these stories are amazing.For the writing, I understand you have to sort of swallow a couple of pills, with the stock characters, and crazy premises, but once you suspend some disbelief and just trust the movie vehicle to take you on a ride, then there is a good time to be had.I'm not even sure I like the characters from the original series all that much, but it feels like they are portraying them very accurately, and giving such a great performance that it almost doesn't matter.If you're ready to let go for a bit (kind of like you would for a Marvel movie), then you should like this"

The film is generally fun. But it lacked the heart and soul present in all five television series (ain't counting no cartoons). The ""Spock Prime"" character is about as confusing as it gets. And while the homages to Leonard Nimoy were touching, they were a bit heavy handed.But worst of all was the loss of any subtlety and heart. This reboot increasing seems to be solely about the money.And the negative reaction to Zulu being gay -- which was handled with taste and, unlike the rest of the film, subtlety -- was just plain crazy. I would think that fans would have been a lot more upset about the Uhura-Spock romantic relationship given the nature of Vulcans, even half-human, half-Vulcan ones -- now that's moving away from the Roddenberry playbook far more than making Zulu gay.All in all, Star Trek Beyond is a pleasant, but not very satisfying addition to the Star Trek compendium."

How eagerly I was waiting to see the Starfleet in action fulfilling its creed and now finally we set off to the mission of deep space exploration.I absolutely love all the little details of a journey that stretches over days-months-years. The remarks that show how U.S.S. Enterprise has become a home for a huge crew are just so relatable and human that you cannot help loving the team even more.The story is such a fluid stream that you just want to kick back your seat and enjoy the pleasant ride, however, then you realize that it is not that simple because the stream becomes a mountain river and your inner adrenaline junky jumps out like a werewolf in a full moon.The beats of the plot are doing a solid job of keeping you attentive to details to appreciate the work of the writers and at the same time they make you dive into the story, letting it embrace you. The hero line that has started in the first movie is strong: the righteous captain and his friends are doing everything in their powers to help those in need. The evolution of villains' appetite is what makes a great impact. Every movie gives a bigger threat that urges main characters to adapt and discover new ways that keep us entertained.Sure, there are moments that are taken directly from ""Book of clichés"", but their low count just improves the overall picture and the magazine of scenes that simply rock is locked and loaded. There was a moment that gave me a goosebumps of epicness that I haven't experienced for a long time, sending me back to the time I had watched the first movie and then quickly bringing me back to enjoy the exact reason why they write the stories about the crew of legendary Captain Kirk.I would say that this thrilogy is way better that one could have expected and if everything ends on this high note I am more than delighted. However, I have heard the rumors of the fourth installment being in works...if it is true, then I will patiently wait as the great Captain James T. Kirk and the team haven't let me down."

",0.6249,0.9996,2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"In Star Trek Beyond, the follow up to the J. J. Abrams reboot Star Trek and Star Trek: Into Darkness, Kirk and the crew of the USS Enterprise are three years into their five-year mission, and we get to catch up with the goings on the ship, their interpersonal connections and struggles, and their general daily lives. Kirk in particular struggles to find the meaning and purpose in their mission, and what role he truly wishes to play in Starfleet.He is not the only one among his crew pondering their place and role on the Enterprise, but before any of them find resolution, an escape pod emerges from a Nebula close to the star base Yorktown, with an inhabitant calling for help in rescuing her stranded ship.Having the necessary technology to withstand the Nebula's harsh environment, the Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission. However things are not as they seem, and the Enterprise and her crew are flying in to danger. What awaits for them in the Nebula? Will they be cunning, able, and united enough to face that danger?Target AudienceOf course fans of the J.J. Abrams reboot will find a lot to love here. This film has the same charismatic cast, the same energy, the same humor, and they all live up to the standard of the previous films very well. This film has a great deal of action, both in space and on the ground. It has great interpersonal drama, character building, and character interaction. It will appeal to fans of the genre, of the franchise, and of action films in general.Interestingly, I feel that this film will also appeal to fans of the classic Star Trek series perhaps more than the first two did. This film does not have the same wonky elements like red matter from the first film, ridiculously close planets, or magic blood. But more importantly, this film strives to include broader themes and philosophical underpinnings that felt largely absent from the previous films, even though they get a bit of a bad rap in that regard.Star Trek Beyond manages to both avoid the weaknesses of the previous films and continue the good elements that made those two a blast to watch. It is clever, with an excellent script, witty dialogue, and a strong plot that has its own identity and purpose. The same excellent cast returns with some great new additions, and their acting is fantastic across the board, even when particular characters are not given much to do.The action is thrilling and interesting, both conceptually and visually, and it feels impact full and meaningful. The humor is fun and never detracts from the plot, though, to be fair, one moment goes so over-the-top ridiculous and epic that I could see some killjoys feeling it ruined the seriousness of the scene. Some people just need to learn to have fun.What struck me most while watching this film were the intellectual elements that felt missing or muted in the previous two films. That is, this film has themes that apply to our current world situation, even if they are a bit simplistic in their examination. It was a pleasure to think about the ways in which the villain embodies a number of the problems in our current social landscape, and how his problems with the Federation and his conflict with Kirk speak to the rifts in our society. That wasn't a line of thought that I'd felt compelled into after watching the other two films. It is refreshing.While no single moment met the heights of the first Abrams film, and while the villain isn't as intimidating and powerful as Benedict Cumberbatch's turn as Khan from the second, Star Trek Beyond has the most consistently good quality across the whole run time, and beyond that, it is the most ""Star Trek"" of all three. As of right now, Star Trek Beyond is my favorite of the trilogy, and there is no doubt that it is...4.5-5 Rating - Awesome!If you want to know more about my rating systems, check out what each rating means HERE.If you enjoyed this review, keep on reading for ""The Long Take"" which goes into more detail, but avoids major spoilers, and ""Spoiler Talk,"" where I can and will talk about anything I like.

The Long TakeThe advertising campaign for this movie made me really worried at first. The music, the action, the quips, all made me think that this movie was going to be just dumb action and no brain. I was worried they weren't even going to have the heart that made the previous two films feel worthwhile. However, the advertising campaign in no way conveyed the reality of this film. The final product that we have here is so much better than what the trailer was promising.Don't get me wrong! This film is full of action. It has quips, rampant humor and lightheartedness. Even the Beastie Boys' music play a bigger role in the events of the film than I had at all anticipated. Yet, all of those things are done very well and not at the expense of either brain or heart. There are many poignant character moments, and there are many themes and ideas to go over.STAR TREK BEYONDChris Pine's Captain Kirk is struggling to find his own motivation and purpose. He has let his life be defined by ego, and the role and desires that others have had for his life.Zachary Quinto's Spock is having to deal with the continuing fallout of the first film, as well as a new personal tragedy, and the relationship separation between himself and Lieutenant Uhura.Zoe Saldana's Uhura never becomes entirely helpless, even when she is put into terrible situations. She remains strong and capable and shows that just because she is the communications officer, that doesn't mean she is not one of the best of Starfleet.Karl Urban's Doctor McCoy has many interesting character dynamics with the other crew members, especially between himself and Spock, that add layers to both his character and those around him.John Cho's Sulu is placed in a position in which she must protect those he loves, and comes into his own as a commander, to a degree.Simon Pegg's Scotty manages to not only keep the ship running but also forms an unlikely friendship with the strange alien character Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella.He has several bonding moments with her, that gives us more insight into both of their characters. Speaking of Jaylah, she is a fantastic new addition to the cast, with motivations, fears, strengths, technical and martial skills, and a killer look. She has a distinct self-reliant personality that sets her apart from the rest of the cast, and she kicks some serious ass. I would love to see her return in the future installments and the franchise.There are many storylines, motivations, and character arcs to follow throughout the course of the entire film. Despite their number, they each feel worthwhile and interesting in their own right. Importantly, everyone feels like a real person and those with only brief screen time still manage relevance.Idris Elba plays Krall, a villain that feels bland and typical for the first two acts of the film, but in true Star Trek fashion, we find out that there's a whole other layer to him in the third act. Ultimately, he is an archetype of many previous Star Trek villains throughout the franchise's history.Despite this, his motivations, and the way he fits into the plot, as well as the conflict he has with Kirk, all play a pivotal role in the themes and ideas of the film. He may not be as imposing as Khan, and he may not be as deadly as Nero, but I thought a lot more about him and what he represents.The plot manages to both be complex and makes sense. There are no major holes that I could see. I will say, there are some questions regarding the backstory and origin of the villain that the film hints at but never flatly answers for the audience. I could see some people who don't catch those hints, or don't think hard enough to put two and two together, might think of them as plot holes, but I believe it to be a minor quibble.On top of all of this, the visuals of the film are absolutely stunning. From the design of the ships and space stations, to the aliens both friendly and not, there's a lot to please the eyes here. The key space station, the Yorktown, was especially stunning. It reminded me of stuff out of Mass Effect, like the citadel. Those sorts of amazing visuals and mind bending designs add to the atmosphere of the story, and the Yorktown's rotating globe design led to one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie, which I will talk about in the spoilers.Conclusion and Star Rating:I had a blast with this film. Not only that, I like it more and more the more I think about it. I liked the first J.J. Abrams film because of how well it nailed the characters while adding a sense of humor and especially urgency that sometimes felt absent from the original series. I enjoyed the second one quite a bit, and I think that it gets an unfair treatment amongst fans for some of its flaws. Both of those films are great, but as much as I love certain elements of them, other elements also brought them down a bit for me.There is nothing like that in this film. There is no scene or moment or idea that tarnishes the good. Because of that, ""Star Trek Beyond"" is my favorite of the three, and the best overall of this reboot series. Star Trek Beyond is a ""Great"" movie.
4.5 StarsFour and one-half StarsThere are many references to past films and television series throughout this movie. There are honestly too many to go over here, but I will mention a couple that stuck out to me. In particular, I was surprised at the amount of love that the Star Trek: Enterprise series received. The crashed USS Franklin is the same type of ship as the Enterprise was in that series. There are also references to MACOs, the Xindi and the Romulan Wars.There are also references to the original series episode in which the Enterprise runs into the ""god"" Apollo, or more specifically, they reference the green hand in space."

",0.0,-0.0625,2019-12-29 00:00:00,5,"Cheap and powerful computer-generated imagery has made it too tempting to script so many ridiculous survival sequences that they no longer create tension. Often so much is going on so quickly that it's often hard to spot and understand important things that happen.The other problem with modern Star Trek movies is that they feel the need to shoehorn comedy. This is unlike Star Wars, which helps suspend disbelief by mostly taking itself seriously.The acting was fine, especially from Idris Elba. And each of the main cast had a meaty contribution to the insights and the actions, unlike the old Shatner-imposed Kirk-shows. The underlying story was quite good, though they couldn't resist a clichéd mano-a-mano + countdown climax.5/10: I made it to the end, but will never watch it again."
" Start Wreck
",-0.4404,0.9032,2019-12-20 00:00:00,5,"And so we have yet another big-budget Star Trek movie in which the crew are presented with a new megalomaniac called Krall, out, as ever, to destroy the United Federation Of Planets. As with the two previous episodes of the reboot, the film relies on the viewer's identification with the new representation of the original characters with lookalike younger actors, combined with high-tech special effects on a grand scale.For me though, as before with its predecessors, I found that that the C-Gen action sequences tended to overpower the human elements, which I probably, if reluctantly have to accept perhaps reflect the taste of a younger demographic than mine for computer-game visuals over individual characterisation. That, as well of course as the massive budget a film like this can command, yet still I feel something has been lost in transition.The story itself seemed unoriginal, padded out and at times merely a vehicle for the tech guys to work their next big sequence, be it a multi-hologrammed Kirk attacking Krall's base on a space-bike from all directions or the final gravity-defying fight to the death between the two K's, while the space race to save the space base seemed to belong to that other starry franchise.Yes, old-timers like me still get more of a kick out of the old pretend-animosity between McCoy and Spock, Simon Pegg's deliberately exaggerated fake Scottish accent or Kirk's over-the-top heroism and one or two of the old familiar phrases (""I'm a Doctor, Jim, not a..."") are dropped in like amuse-bouches but I've long ago abandoned hope of seeing a Trek flick which doesn't have to pile on the graphics to bludgeon me into submission.I guess it was brave of the writers to attempt to fashion a new super-villain when it might have been easier to rework one of the old TV baddies but in a crowded market for SFX blockbusters, this particular series seems to be feeling the squeeze and it might just take the last drop of the dilythium crystals to warp it back into the public consciousness again."

At the beginning , in the opening scene , Captain Kirk is suddenly attacked by hoards of small aliens. After being beamed back to the Enterprise , he remarks: ""I ripped my shirt again¨. The Enterprise is on the 966th day of its five-year mission and after stopping off at Starbase Yorktown , the crew of the Enterprise is called a new assignment at a remote outpost on the fringes of Federation space . As the USS Enterprise, halfway into their five-year mission to be aware a fleet being destroyed by an unstoppable wave of unknown aliens , then Captain Kirk takes command and joins his team and they set out in investigating . With a personal score to settle , Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a nasty contender who wants to carry out a mass destruction. As the crew of the USS Enterprise explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space , where they encounter a new ruthless enemy leading an evil force , who puts them, and everything the Federation stands for, to the test and leaving our world in a state of crisis . Along the way , the USS Enterprise 1701 suffers warp fields or a static warp bubble and the aircraft is seriously damaged . Later on , Kirk along with his crew (Zachary Quinto : Spock , Zoe Saldana : Uhura , Karl Urban : Bones , Simon Pegg : Scotty , John Cho : Sulu , Anton Yelchin : Chekov) take the Enterprise deep into the dark and mysterious zone . There an alien warlord calles Krall (Idris Elba) seeks an ancient weapon called the Abronath that Kirk has kept hidden later an unsuccessful diplomatic assignment . Only a rebellious alien warrior called Jaylah (Sofia Boutella ) can help them reunite and leave the planet to stop this deadly menace from beginning a possible galactic war.This epic story is concentrated on characters as well as thrill-packed action and state-of-art special effects , in fact , there're numerous of that too . The movie has thrills , tension , emotion , suspense and sensational space scenarios like is customary development of the franchise , though it doesn't features any scenes on or near Earth . The first film of the franchise produced/written by J.J. Abrahams was ¨Star Trek¨(2009) and this film ¨Star Trek : Beyond¨ (2016) is the follow-up to ¨Star Trek Into Darkness¨ (2013) and takes place two and a half years after .Here the Enterprise crew find an unstoppable force of terror from beyond that has detonated a fleet and everything it stands for , as they are stranded on an unknown planet and with no apparent means of rescue , and subsequently, they encounter themselves fighting a ruthless enemy with a well-earned hatred of the Federation . Spectacular , exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new outing of Star Trek , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours and some approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Idealism , humor , humanity , a motley group of agreeable characters and trademark effects abound and will please the enthusiasts as well as the neophyte . As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death , love will be challenged , friendships will be torn apart , and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left : his crew . The nice acting convinces , especially the avenger Idris Elba in a super-villain role , Zachary Quinto in his usual serious character , and the sympathetic Simon Pegg , while other players also make a fine work . And of course , attractive appearance by Sofia Boutella who wears an extreme make-up , giving a sympathetic and enjoyable intervention . As well as brief acting by Greg Grunberg , being his second Star Trek film in the current franchise , but only his first on-screen appearance as Commander Finnegan . And being Anton Yelchin's final Star Trek film before his death on June 19, 2016 , at the age of twenty-seven years old and caused by a car accident .Stirring final amazing really the spectator , in which the moving and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . Interesting screenplay , well written by various screenwriters : Simon Pegg , Doug Jung and uncredited : Roberto Orci , Patrick McKay , John D. Payne , J.J. Abrams , based upon ""Star Trek"" created by Gene Roddenberry. Screen-writer/actor Simon Pegg explained that the dilemma for the sequel was whether to pit the crew against another villain like in Star Trek (2009), or to have an ""exploration sci-fi plot where the unknown and nature itself is somehow an adversary"", like on Star Trek , the original series (1966) . Breathtaking soundtrack by Michael Giacchino , he composes an impressive musical accompaniment to the film . This marks the first time a Star Trek film has shot outside the United States and not in Hollywood . In fact this is the only Star Trek film to be shot primarily in Vancouver , British Columbia, and the existing sets were rebuilt for special effects sequences . Furthermore , a colorful and evocative cinematography by Stephen Windon ; however , being first Star Trek feature to be shot entirely digital adding a lot of frames in CGI . Paramount Pictures requested the notorious director Justin Lin who provided a nail-biting and sensational science-fiction movie , he previously made a lot of successes , such as : Annapolis , Better luck tomorrow , Fast & Furious , Tokyo race , Fast and Furious 5 , Fast and Furious 6 , among others . Suitable for family viewing , it's an entertaining adventure which young and old men will enjoy . Fans of the series will find very amusing and charming . It is fun to watch and Trekkies are sure to love it , resulting to be one of the best Star Trek sequels of all time and the highest grossing film of all the Star Trek movies."
" I really like the popcorn star trek.
",0.4201,0.9931,2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I really like the jj abrams star trek trilogy, i know that trekkers like the most soficsticated and filosofical conversation but sometimes we need the wonder and adventure. The third installment is very action and fun packed movie, kirk is the most badass and fun character of the movie, he's really the full leader now. Spock and magro are great as a doyble. The only thing that its a problem for me, its the villain, idris elba have a great performance but he's backstory did not convinced me. And a really miss some of the science and more serious stuff that abrams movies have. But something its true this is the most fun of the three, and is because of justin lin's directorial style, and this benefits the movie because we have a diferent and more adventure installment in the trek series.
Im not a trekker and even a original series fan, im just a film lover and this trilogy is a very fun ride, in the interprise ship."
" Exciting and fun, one of the best examples of Trek as an action movie
",0.8934,0.9835,2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"With the world established, the characters set, and the awkward teenage years behind them, it was about time for the crew of the Enterprise to have a more interesting and cohesive adventure. I'm kind of happy that it didn't grow up too much, though, because the action is fun.Three years into his five years mission of deep space exploration Captain Kirk gets attacked by tiny monsters and then writes a log about how bored he is. Well, really, it's about how life in deep space has become repetitive and seemingly pointless considering the vastness and infinity of the universe. It's an interesting place to begin Kirk, essentially making him a new character after the brash youth of the first two rebooted films. He's quieter, more isolated, and more tired. When the Enterprise docks at Yorktown, an expansive (and wonderfully designed) space station, Kirk talks to an admiral about a promotion that would remove him from the captain's chair.An escape pod floats towards Yorktown and the survivor begs Starfleet for help. Her ship is hidden on a planet in a nearby nebula. Kirk volunteers for the mission, and they're off. The ship gets attacked by a swarm of small ships, cutting it to pieces. The destruction is rather surprising (although it misses the emotional impact of the Enterprise's destruction in The Search for Spock), and the survivors gets split up. Most get kidnapped by the bad guy, Krall, while most of the main characters escape to the surface to organize a rescue.The antagonist, Krall, has the most potential of any Star Trek villain in all thirteen films, but he doesn't reach it. For about four-fifths of the running time, he's the bad guy in make up who hates the Federation and little else. However, we get a reveal late in the movie that he's actually Balthazar Edison, the captain of the USS Franklin, a hundred year old ship. Krall has been kept alive by sciency mumbo jumbo that sucks life from other people, and he's developed a hatred for everything the Federation stands for. He was born of a time before the Federation, never really found his footing in the new world of peace, and was lost in space. His extended time shipwrecked on this planet in deep space combined with his antipathy against the Federation and its ideals to create a monster. Unfortunately, we get all of this way too late in the film. I wish his backstory could have been revealed much earlier in the film to give time for more people to bounce ideas off of him instead of having their arguments be about ""unity is our strength"" generics.There's another new character in the mix: Jaylah. She's a former victim of Krall who escaped and set up shop in the ruins of the Franklin, hidden on a cliff. She's really good, though, again, her backstory comes in a quick burst late in the movie. I would have been happy without the backstory, though I suppose some explanation for her presence is necessary, because I think she's a really good character without the backstory. She's inventive, speaks in an entertainingly broken English, has an affinity for Public Enemy, and shows genuine fear at Krall. She uses the Enterprise crew (in particular Scotty) to get what she wants, and they use her to get what they want. It's a really entertaining dynamicKirk's journey through this adventure brings him back to the central mission of Starfleet. The search for the unknown, the danger of the cosmos, begin to appeal to him once again. The use of the Franklin was a great decision by the film. It's old and rickety instead of sleek and safe like the Enterprise. Just getting it into the air is a thrill ride that nearly kills everyone. The ship itself is used as he reaffirms his joy in the ideals of exploration. By the end, he's turning down the vice-admiral promotion and talking about the dangers of deep space in a way we haven't seen since he first showed up at Starfleet Academy.On top of it all, the action is really well done. It ends up balancing some silliness with a motorcycle better than expected. The destruction of the enterprise is methodical and really well rendered. The final battle with the swarm uses Beastie Boys music better than 2009's Star Trek did. It's a rocking, rolling, good time and it actually has good characters and a solid story behind it. It's the best Star Trek movie since First Contact."
" Beyond me
",0.0,0.6174,2019-11-11 00:00:00,3,"Absurd and boring in equal parts.
This film is singularly bereft of merit as a star trek film, a sci fi film, any sort of film. The villain makes no sense and it appears that he exists to seek out and explore strange new awfulness in the antagonist role. Another old timer who just can't adapt to the world of the peaceable federation and it's star fleet merchant marine. So when he gets into some bother on a mission and the peaceful, unaggressive federation don't succeed in rescuing him he goes bonkers about that......right......his volunteer professional crewe being abandoned with him must have been the final straw........i suppose he must have some motive to mess up our heros and their ship and provide them with a suitably serious ""threat"" to glorify their inevitable triumph against his super weapon plans. Super is a word that I won't use again in this review.Unfortunately, if our villain was really a soldier, he would have immobilised his old ship rendering it useless to any potential enemy as soon as it was of no further value to him. Anything that you can not use or move you spike it. Incapacitate it to deny your enemy the asset. As a soldier he would not abandon his command intact and leave it for anybody to just use. That's silly. Don't be so silly!
But he's only a soldier in ways that advance this silly story and never in ways that might improve it instead. Really it's an excuse to be bad to our goodies and serves no purpose 'beyond' that.
After so many years that old federation ship sure works well. Obviously the federation build things to last. On the surface of a life supporting planet......and all the wonderful eroding and growing and metabolising that life likes to do.
Unfortunately federation shields can't be relied on so unquestioningly, especially when something that you really wouldn't want to reach your ship is trying to reach your ship. The film gives us the chance to see an updated and upgraded version of the death of the Enterprise D from Generations.
Actually the federation shields were AWOL there too, but rather more forgivably the writers made up an excuse for it on that occasion.
Giant space domes are within federation technology though apparently. Although defensive systems for such a vulnerable design seem to be, perhaps, in need of uprating.....blimey the soldier weirdo was right....this is a space station on the edge of known space right?3 star review because the cast are competent actors. Sound and costumes are of a professional standard. Film is only slightly overlong for the machinations contained within it's plot. Probably justifies this version of the star trek I.P. going into abeyance."

The biggest plot gap is how Captain Edison became Krall. They barely brush over it. How does he suck the life energy from other beings? In the movie all he does is touch them. How/why does his appearance change? Where does he get all those ships that swarm and destroy ALL OTHER SHIPS? Why did he not wonder where his ship disappeared to? If this ancient race was so advanced, why did they abandon the planet and disappear, never to be seen again? Why didn't he leave on one of those advanced ships instead of staying on the planet?
If you read the other reviews on here you'll see a lot of nonsense about not sticking to the original series' purpose. I don't really care about that. I just want good science fiction with a great script. Either this script needed work, or the editor left out important scenes and ruined the story. Not my favorite of the series.

" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.9946,2019-09-22 00:00:00,1,"Well, I finally saw it and I can honestly say that I was far less offended by it than I was by the hack job reboot of Kahn. And I only cared slightly less about the film than I did the original JJ reboot.It was a popcorn sci-fi action flick, and I liked Urban and Pine but thought that Quinto should have brought more of himself to the film rather than attempting to channel Nimoy. It was a fair enough impression, but it didn't fit with the rest of the reboot that seemed to care nothing about Star Trek.Ultimately when Quinto channels Nimoy like that it just gives the viewer the jarring sensation that one member of the cast cared about what came before and forces the viewer to remember that this actually is a Star Trek film.And that doesn't work in a rebooted franchise that relies on nostalgia, in place of a story, and then kind of mocks the nostalgia.That is ultimately the problem, Star Trek was a science-Fiction space adventure that was both cheesy and offered veiled social commentary about an idealistic world governed by a strict meritocracy with a strong morality and how that idealism clashes with other species and ideals by both forging alliances and making enemies.This had nothing to do with that. It is basically an action movie with science-fiction elements and occasional nods to the cheesy fun that Star Trek once was. At it's core it didn't have the heart that lends itself to an engaging plot and character arcs.And, given that it came after a betrayal, that is after they rebooted one of the franchise's best films and took away most everything that made it so great and fun... I didn't care enough to actually see it until it came on television.The real issue the reboot thing, for some reason they always take out plot and character development and fill that void with action and it makes the film feel visually appealing yet hallow."
" Not Mindfully Engaging
",-0.2584,0.5783,2019-08-27 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This was like watching a Kraft cheese slice thin amount a plot slotted in between action scene after action scene after action scene. Overall, it felt like mindless bumbling lighthearted action. The plot never really drew me in to engage my emotions to it whatsoever. Sure there are impressive special effects and some amusing moments but I rarely felt any tension or concern. The Enterprise gets duped into a embarking on a rescue mission that is a trap. The Enterprise gets demolished dramatically in a drawn out scene and crash lands. Will Kirk and crew survive or find their way back home? The villain isn't interesting and you don't learn until the very end why he has been angered as far as I noticed. So the viewer has little story to chew on as the crew try to rescue themselves while also stopping the villain's overarching vengeful plan. This just felt like a mindless summer blockbuster and as a non-Trek guru, I'd expect a more meaningful story."

If you are expecting the immediate action, serious, action, serious sequence that J.J. Abrams gave us in the first two, you will be seriously disappointed. Majority of the background music alone makes this more of a drama than action film. Everyone is in a sad mood, and not interacting with others for their own personal reasons that they hold off on sharing with each other until the end.
I admit that their were a few tears in the first two, but they were brief followed by immediate action in more ways than one. This film is unbelievable because Kirk and Spock usually turn their sadness into rage or vengeance as a source of energy to put them into overdrive.Yes the original Spock actor Leonard Nimoy died in real life, and so did the Chekov actor Anton Yelchin. But that's no reason to give us over and hour of dramatic music like all is lost with literally a brief scene of action near the end, followed by more soap opera drama at the end.

" The best encapsulation of Star Trek in a film since The Voyage Home.
",0.6369,0.997,2019-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Which isn't to say it's the best Trek film since Voyage Home, but it does a good job of capturing the TOS vibe. It's not trying to show a dark side. Rather, Beyond has the best visual embodiment of the United Federation of Planets ever put to film with its sweeping shots of the Yorktown starbase. And the Enterprise traversing the nebula, or traveling through its warp bubble, are what a modern Star Trek should look and feel like. Likewise we get Trek-y moments, random crewmen aiding each other, the stalwart first officer standing behind his captain, Kirk and Bones taking time for a drink.And we get a story that's more than a collection of set-pieces strung together with a thin narrative thread--no beaming from Earth to Kronos to fight Klingons in this one, thank Kahless. The script delivers characterizations that feel closer to their TV originals. Spock's required emotional outburst isn't violent, and has a decent rationale. We get more of Karl Urban's great take on Dr. McCoy. And Kirk is the leader we need. We also get time to build a relationship with the new versions of the characters as they get to slow down and talk to each other, shame we had to wait three films for that to happen.But Beyond can't alone create an emotional weight that should've been building in the two previous films. As such, it can only be a truly fun summer blockbuster, good but not great, and missing some emotional resonance. Had it been the second film in the series maybe it wouldn't be the last film with this cast. But it wasn't, which is a shame, because Beyond is a welcome return to a more hopeful future were unity and smart teamwork make the universe a better place to live."
" Nothing but disappointment.

And what they had was JJ Abrams mucking about. Sticking his fingers and nose all over this film. This Star Trek movie had a really good chance to rise up to the same caliber as Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek. But, once again JJ Abrams was involved with the making of this film. JJ's moving making formula dumbed down any intelligent writing done by Mr Pegg and Mr Jung. JJ Abrams has this way of turning gold into coal. If you are a Star Trek fan from the original Gene Roddenberry series, this film will only break your heart. There is nothing there that makes you feel anything for any for any of the characters. The basic plot and the whole look of the movie extremely predictable as is all of JJ Abrams movies and films. When will the Hollywood elites stop hiring JJ Abrams to destroy all of these movie franchises?

When I decided that I'd had enough, there'd been no real plot development, just lots of nonsensical nothing followed by 10 or 15 minutes of utterly incomprehensible space warfare during which it was impossible to have any real idea of what was going on. The acting and dialogue were virtually non-existent and evrything relied on computer generated special effects which might be clever but are also very obvious and, frankly, boring.For me, this one hits a new low. I'll give it 1/10 because 0, or a negative score, aren't allowed. Rubbish, tripe, bilge, garbage - what more needs to be said ? Anyone who has a liking for the real Star Trek be warned."

That is what it makes this film more special. I think I'm going to miss him.Another fact which makes this film special is that this film does have moments of happiness and sadness. One of them is when the Enterprise was destroyed. Krall's bees attacking the Enterprise scene was the saddest scenes of all. I could feel how Jim felt. Watching the destruction of something you love and you can't do anything to stop it but to watch is very sad and it's the worst. It makes too emotional.The other fact I like is that they make new species that is not the enemy to the Enterprise.

" A film that touts going ""Beyond"", this movie ended up just being more of the same
",-0.0258,0.9671,2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"First off, I want to admit that I am more of a Star Wars fan than a Star Trek fan. As a result, I have enjoyed the first two of the Star Trek reboot titles because they are structured more like a Star Wars film than a Star Trek one. Of course, this may also be due to my bias toward J.J. Abrams and everything that he directs. For this third installment in the reboot series, we no longer have Abrams, but rather Justin Lin (known for the Fast & Furious franchise). Maybe because of this, I didn't really think this film stood up to the previous two.Sure, there were segments that I thought were interesting and deep, but they were merely bookends in a confusing hodgepodge of action and ""buddy up"" subplots. I appreciated the beginning, with its humanizing narrative that made sense for the captain's current state of affairs. This examination of Kirk's (Chris Pine) doubt would have been nice to delve into, but it was interrupted by the ""inciting incident"" that results in the crew being split up on an alien planet with no ship to their name. Of the pairs of characters who were stranded together, Bones (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) was clearly the best set, since both are polar opposites when it comes to their beliefs and worldviews (Scotty's (Simon Pegg) sub-plot was pretty OK as well).If I were to pinpoint the major flaw in this film, it's that nothing really happened. Sure, there was plenty of action, a clear enemy, and a goal of survival that made sense, but it just felt like everything could have been condensed down into a thirty-minute episode instead of a 2-hour movie. Because of Kirk's introduction, there was no twist. Everything was just kind of procedural and it lacked the excitement of anything deeper than its flashy special effects.For a film that touts going ""Beyond"", this movie ended up just being more of the same. I give Star Trek Beyond 3.0 stars out of 5."

I would have thought of it as a great big waste of money. I agree with those who say the plot is very thin and the characters are not well defined. I also agree that this film suffers on too much dependence on explosions, action scenes, and gimmicks.I'm used to Star Trek movies that are actually about something important, where the dialogue is intelligent and where we can identify with both the good guys and the bad guys. Sure, not all Star Trek films are great, but Star Trek Beyond is just mediocre. If you've seen any action film at all, you've seen this movie. There's very little in this movie that can even really identify it as a Star Trek film.Chris Pine really does a great job playing Captain Kirk - or I should say playing Kirk the way William Shatner did. He's by far the best part of this movie. And yet the story is just boring. Watch it if you must, but this really contributes nothing to the Star Trek franchise."

" A Tired Attempt
",-0.4404,-0.9937,2018-12-23 00:00:00,5,"At first I thought the premise for this Star Trek entry was promising, but I was disappointed. The villain was just another megalomaniac out to destroy the universe with a gadget he found on a deserted planet. To make matters worse, the screenplay was fairly awful, with trite predictable dialog that struggled to find any sort of characterization. It was not helped by the actors, who seemed to be calling in their performances. There was no real chemistry to be had, and what chemistry was attempted generally fell flat. If the producers thought overloading the movie with action, such as Kirk riding around on a motorcycle, and heavy metal music destroying the alien horde (shades of Mars Attacks!), then they were sadly mistaken. It just added extra layers of silliness to an already damaged film."

Fun and filled with inside jokes, these films are good enough on their own, along with paying homage to the original series.This group of actors, especially Chris Pine, was born to play these roles.By this time in Star Trek history, I had hoped fans would simply enjoy and revel in a beloved tradition. Remember, the operative word is, ""fun!""I wish all the fretful, anguished reviewers who are so desperately concerned about how certain characters ""should"" behave and how the stories ""should"" develop would just put a sock in it.If you are compelled to endlessly argue about every plot point or character, please take the discussion to your bedroom in your Mom's basement and allow the rest of us to just enjoy.Star Trek forever! Let's see what happens! Bring it on and keep the fun rolling!"
" Great action even if it doesn't really feel like 'Star Trek'
",0.4184,0.9653,2018-12-10 00:00:00,8,"Three years into her five year mission the Enterprise stops at Yorktown, a vast new Federation outpost near the frontier of Federation Space. While there an alien arrives asking for help; her crewmates are trapped in a nearby nebula. Inevitably the Enterprise is the only ship for the job. Once in the nebula they are attacked by a swarm of small ships which they are unable to defend against. The attackers, led by Krall, take many of the crew while others make, including Kirk, Spock, Scotty and Bones, make it to a nearby planet. Bones lands near the injured Spock while Kirk and Scotty are alone. The latter soon finds himself with Jaylah, an alien warrior woman who explains that they have a common foe. Now they must get back together, rescue the captured crew before thwarting Krall's plans which threaten the Federation.If you want lots of action then this film certainly delivers even if it doesn't feel like traditional Star Trek... more space opera than science fiction. The story is solid even if most of what happens is there to justify the next action set-piece. There are a few twists along the way; some of which are more surprising than others. The action is very impressive with some very kinetic space battles; these looked great on my small television so I imagine they would be amazing on a big screen. There are also close quarters fights including some fun martial arts from Jaylah. It isn't entirely about the action of course; there is some good character development and interaction; some of it quite emotional. The cast is solid bringing a sense of fun to the drama although guest star Sofia Boutella stands out as Jaylah... I couldn't help wishing she was in the regular crew. Idris Elba also impresses as Krall. Overall I enjoyed it for the impressive action so would recommend it even though hardened Star Trek fans have justified reasons for being disappointed."

Abrams which were extremely strong respecting the roots of the previous films universe as well as building an alternate universe for the new films to continue.And the new installment though from a new director Justin Lin (Furious 6) establishes the same style and entertainment from the franchise the viewers expect.The expansion of the universe through colourful and deep characters is innovative.My personal observation was the amazing action sequences and the cinematography.Overall - 3.5/5

For me the first rule of Sci-fi is, you always have to believe in what you are seeing and I found this latest 'Trek' adventure way to fantastic for my tastes (such as Star Ships crashing on peoples heads and no one getting hurt). In the original TV show there were so many good jokes but the only line (in 'Beyond') that made me half smile, was when one of the trusty crew members hears a track by 'Public Enemy' and questions if this is what mankind used to refer to classical music? The reply was ""Yes indeed"". Shame the rest of the story/script was a bit like space balls, or a piece of space junk floating around the earth."

" Slightly better second time around
",0.3832,0.8346,2018-10-15 00:00:00,5,"I hated this the first time I saw it. Rubbish plotting, nonsensical twists and a hideous monstrosity of a space station. Second time around, these faults remain but, crucially, this time it feels more like a Star Trek movie. The irrational insistence on inventing more and more outlandish alien species instead of exploring the myriad species already in existence remains grating, but the references to the Enterprise television series were gratifying. More importantly, all of the main crew members got to contribute this time, instead of focussing on 3 or 4 of them. I still don't like the Kelvin timeline though."

" ""We will find hope in the impossible.""
",0.4404,0.1785,2018-10-06 00:00:00,7,"In general, I find the current Star Trek franchise entertaining enough, but wonder why the writers stray from the continuity of the original series as much as they do. For example, and this is a big one, the scene in which Spock (Zachary Quinto) was advised that his father had died, an age enhanced image of Leonard Nimoy as Spock was used to convey the message. To my thinking, the right thing to do would have been to use a photo of Mark Lenard as Sarek from the episode ""Journey to Babel"" in which the father of Spock was first introduced. That would have made more sense, especially for those like myself who have some time and effort invested in the television series. But that was fifty years ago, so why bother I guess the thinking goes. Another thing that was a puzzler was that more recent photo of the original Star Trek crew that popped up near the end of this movie from one of the later motion pictures. Maybe I lost focus for a moment, but how was that possible? Oh well, enough of that. One of the things that did seem to work somewhat was the tease of a relationship between Spock and Uhura (Zoe Saldana), established in the prior movie 'Into Darkness"". The Uhura/Spock dynamic WAS at work in the first couple of episodes in the original Star Trek series, but eventually dropped in favor of Spock becoming more 'logical. I also noticed that Uhura's skirt in this picture was positioned pretty much where it took a number of episodes to get to after the series got under way. I'd keep tabs on that when I used to watch the shows in re-runs and on video, and thought the gradual transition back then was affected quite subtly by the film makers. If you've got nothing better to do you ought to check it out. So for anyone who might have lost track in the story, Krall's (Idris Elba) swarm formations relied on some form of unified cyberpathic coordination. The Trek crew responded with electromagnetic focusing to disrupt the cyberpathic link, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) reconfiguring the USS Franklin's VHF output into a multiphasic sweep. Broadcasting at 57.7 megahertz, they momentarily lost polarization of the hull plating, but were eventually able to reroute power from the dilithium chambers. Now if it were up to me, I would have kicked up the operating frequency to about 66.6 megahertz, because as we all know, '666' is the sign of the beast, and what better way to defeat the bad guy than to use his own numbers against him? But since it wasn't up to me, I just settled back and went along with the rest of the story without too much trouble. You didn't need a Vulcan mind probe to know that Kirk (Chris Pine) would turn down the Vice Admiral job or that Spock would hang around for more planet surfing. I think this mission is far from over."
" If you liked the two others this one is just fine.

Fight scenes are fun and the cultivated relationship between the characters still remains. If you have enjoyed the previous films, this will not disappoint. Although it is definitely the weakest out of the three. Story Telling: I found the story to be a bit bland. The new characters where just ok and the villain was quite ordinary. It's entertaining, but the story is not that memorable. Visuals and sound: Not disappointing, but I found the colour to be a bit bland. The sounds where entertaining.

" Sigh...
",0.0,0.2732,2018-09-27 00:00:00,5,Star Trek just isn't what it used to be. It's lost its personality. It's lost its style. This film was one such example. I might sound like a purist - but I miss the old films and TV formats. The old characters. The old Klingons. This is clearly a film geared at the modern era who know nothing about Star Trek. It's very blockbuster-y without any substance. Not memorable at all.

" Beyond Dumb
",-0.5106,0.9315,2018-08-13 00:00:00,2,"Star Trek Beyond is the worst Star Trek movie I've seen and one of the worst movies ever made. Beyond has no point to raise or moral question to ask, but that is an extremely high bar for a Hollywood Blockbuster, so we'll forgive it for that. The problem is, it's so stupid and poorly constructed that it can't even manage to entertain.James T Kirk is thinking of giving it all up for an admiral position on a CGI space station, but a dramatic situation calls for the Enterprise to sail through a rock-nebula-shock thingy to rescue some aliens. Trouble is, they get attacked by a huge swarm of ships that blows the CGI budget out of the water and there is sadly no money left for a script.Krall, the main baddie, wants a special ""weapon"" that is on the Enterprise and he almost finds it, but Kirk is a sneaky mother******. The Enterprise is destroyed in the scuffle and all the main characters survive unlikely situations because nobody important will die. This first third of the movie is a bad excuse to show actors climbing and sliding through expensive sets because those damn ship stabilizers are playing up again! Once on the planet, people are separated and Kirk can locate them because of a special necklace Spock gave to Lieutenant Uhura-damsel-in-distress, but we can't transport them because there interference from the nearby rocks. Uhura and Sulu escape their cells, with the aid of projectile vomit (that's not even a joke), and find out what the enemies are doing before getting caught again. Krall spends the rest of the movie telling Uhura about his grand plans while she acts like she forgot to wash her hair. Meanwhile, Spock and Bones vie for the worst dialogue in the history of cinema until they get transported to safety in another plot convenience in an ocean of plot conveniences.The main crew chill on an old federation ship that uses monochrome screens so the audience knows that it's old, really really old. And Kirk finds a motorcycle on board, because Pine must have a two-wheeled scene in his contract, and he uses it to holographically mind-**** a bunch of incompetent aliens, despite the fact that they have millions of ships.But we're not done. With the superweapon finally in hand, Krall takes his endless swarm of ships back to the CGI space station and wins easily (without the superweapon). But Kirk flies in to save the day and uses the super old ship, with Beastie Boys music magic, to surf a ""wave"" of ships in the a scene that will make you want to Hang Ten-hang yourself ten times. At this point, talking about the absurd final battle is just going to raise my blood pressure Beyond tolerable limits. Anybody with a brain will be dumber for having seen this movie. Anybody who loves Star Trek deserves a heartfelt apology from the cast and crew. Anybody that doesn't want to stab themselves in the eye after watching this is abomination has a tolerance Beyond any mere mortal."
" Better second time round
",0.4404,0.8969,2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I first reviewed this as a 6. But now on second watch I am giving it an 8. I am not sure why the difference. Except. I am watching this at home a bit drunk on a small screen. And I wonder if the central idea of this film, of being part of a crew, got lost in the big screen spectacle viewing of this first time around.
This is an action packed Star Trek film, but it still has the heart of Star Trek - an ensemble piece, where the core crew are ALL heroes, and each play their part to solve the crisis. In this film they all do, and I liked it better second time around, because I think I picked up on that idea, rather than being sucked along on the roller coaster (though I still was). But a big screen overwhelms you with SFX, and spinning cameras ( a key motif of this director). A small screen, shows the core and the flaws, in greater detail, in some ways, because they are not hidden by the spectacle. And I think thats why I liked this more second time round. The heart showed through better."
" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.9379,2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,Awesome movie... I really love the special-effects and the continuation of this great cast.
" Somehow One of the best Treks in Years - hear me out!
",0.6696,0.988,2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"Let me just preamble this by saying that I'm an avid Star Trek fan. My favorite series is the next generation (I thank god for Jean-Luc Picard), and that is the exact reason I love this movie. This pays a tribute to the Treks of the past while remaining what it is: a new Star Trek in the Kelvin timeline.Real quick, a tangent: those of you who don't like the Kelvin timeline films, I understand where you're coming from. They have a different coat of paint. However, they've all remained Star Trek at their core, exemplifying the same values; Beyond is no different. If the original series had aired today with the same script, it would have undoubtedly been rejected by nearly everyone for being dull and showcasing so much edgy material. That's the point: this series changes to fit with the times. The same old Star Trek can't keep on going or it'll die out. It must adapt to service the world. Back to this movie: the writing was pretty solid. Everyone had a piece in the puzzle. The teams they split into about halfway through were very well done. Jaylah was a good badass and a fine character with a good actress behind her. The villain, Krall, may seem a bit thin at first, but rewatch the movie and you'll see everything makes sense. And with Idris Elba playing him, I mean, c'mon! It's Idris Elba! The rest of the cast performed admirably, sticking to their characters very well and bringing their childish enthusiasm into the mix while still growing. It was a good sendoff to Anton Yelchin (may he Rest In Peace) and quite the tribute to Leonard Nimoy. That brings me back to my main point: this was a great tribute to the original series and Star Trek in general."
" Superhero-Movie in Space
",0.0,0.6124,2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,"Star Trek was - in its past- about some ethic dilemmas, about story or character dvelopement. At least it was about some likable crewmember who did some adventuring together until they get old. And in case of Data and others, it is also about how humans are and some ethic dilemma. In some ways I love the science in star trek and that it had creative writing. I loved the dialogue in some shows and movies and I loved, that it was about exploringStar Trek: Beyond wanted to be ""back to the roots"". It was said a year prior to release, it is going to be about exploring. And I was a little hyped. After the well made 2009 reboot and at least the well acted (Cumberbatch) successor, I hoped for uniting the old fans and the new.My god this movie disappointed on so many levels: The promising ""exploring"" ends after 15 Minutes. The Story is told very fast: The Enterprise flies into a mysterious nebula, only to immidiately meet the new bad guy who they have to defeat or he will defeat... whatever and whenever. Its always the same in the new movies.So the exploring is done after 15 minutes or so, the bad guy is found and what is left is some good vs bad guy fighting, saying ""cool"" oneliners and cut this thing together like a modern superhero (Avengers and others) movie with lots of action and no further story or intelligent dialogue.
If you look for a brainless, heartless entertainment-movie in space that wears the name Star Trek but could be any Sci-Fi movie really, you could or possibly even should watch this movie. If you expect this to be Star Trek like the old days, or Star Trek close to the reboot of 2009 you are going to be disappointed."

Like in TOS it has a crazed Captain against Kirk who finally gets to be the hero and.... AND... The others get their time too.I look back at the original Trek movies and they may not be the best but I can watch most all of them over and over again. I can't with the last two but this one I have watched, maybe 10 times.

I was right to be worried; this is the worst of the trilogy and a big step down from the fun second instalment. What we get here is a faceless, bland, generic villain (Idris Elba cruising by on autopilot), an adventure which replaces character action and plot development with mere technicality, and endless CGI action sequences in which the actors are dwarfed by massive and bland computer effects. The lazy plotting relies on deus ex machina all the while while the main cast members have little to work with, other than reacting to the next special effect. It's a really yawn-worthy film, as bland and generic as they come."
" Average sci-fi film
",0.0,0.8964,2018-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Star Trek Beyond is a very generic blockbuster-type film. The effects and CGI are okay and the performances are fine (though some of the accents are dodgy - looking at you Scotty!) and it doesn't embarrass itself too much, but plot felt unfocused. My main gripe, however, is the lack of heart. Some of the recent Star Trek films have been great, and Star Trek: Discovery is a great series, but Beyond fails to pull you in in the same way. It doesn't speak to overarching themes, or make you feel proud, or excited, or even really feel anything at all. It's generic and dull and even feels a touch unrehearsed and underwritten. I would say watch it, but make sure you've got your ipad with you on the sofa so you can play some games or something too, during the dull bits."

As I've noticed over the years with the newer Star Wars movies beginning with The Force Awakens. Fans simply don't like change or evolution older characters. Abrams has Taken Star Trek in a direction which appeals to younger viewers and not the Trekkers who were around for TNG and the other shows. He's had to make them full of action and violence so the film will bring in more money on opening weekend.

" Mindless, vapid action film devoid of any depth
",-0.4404,0.9617,2018-01-24 00:00:00,4,"I hated both previous installments of the reboot ST universe and I really hoped this one would be an ounce better since Abrams is not behind the wheel but he's still a big part of the franchise and Orci is as well so my hopes were foolish. Everything about this movie is underdeveloped and/or contrived. It's the kind of movie you watch on autopilot and mindlessly chew on popcorn. Nothing new is being said, character development is almost non-existent (Kirk's and Spock's forced 'internal struggles' are laughable), the plot is thin as spring ice and the main villain and his motives unconvincing and lacking in any kind of engagement. I like Pegg and would like to think that the minuscule wit and cleverness in the script that managed to get a laugh or two from me were his doing. One thing he's definitely to be credited with is making Sulu gay which is utterly ridiculous and unnecessary. The scene was overly emphasised with Kirk staring longingly into his direction while Sulu is walking away with his partner and child and it was there only to cater to progressive audience (of which I am a member) while at the same time Uhura is wearing a SKIRT just so she could flash her nice legs because I guess even in this day and age women are there to be pretty and style is more important than substance and practicality. Why make Sulu gay and not make her wear trousers? In case, you know, the ship gets attacked and she can run and jump and shoot comfortably?Actors had little to work with and while I am usually impressed with Quinto, here that was not the case. There were a few scenes where he managed to convey subtle emotions with facial expressions alone but that's definitely not due to excellent writing but due to his talent. Pine had a little more to work with but even he seemed dull and uninterested (as opposed to his role in WW which he played masterfully). I'm not sure why creators think their audience is dumb? Why are they calling this Star Trek when it's clear as day that it isn't? They would still make piles of money if they made smarter films. Spelling something out for the audience and literally verbalising that something is 'philosophical' doesn't make it so!In fairness, this is an average movie for the dumb and tired viewer who likes loud crap, explosions, and poorly executed action sequences but it's a below average Star Trek movie. Way below."
" Star Trek takes the X-File route....
",0.0,0.972,2018-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Trust no one! This is the Trekkie reboot message of the film despite it's overt unity propaganda, which is to be expected. But what's ""Beyond"" that? A Federation that abandons its military hero and his hostage who is allowed to appear as a representative of a species in need of Star Fleets' hi tech and military rescue help on the other side of a nebula (actual uncharted space!) that took less than 5 minutes to get through... confused yet? The other (original) Spock died and Kirk wants out, and that's our beginning... and how do you tie in our opening hilarity with an unwanted piece of a weapon that was presented as a token of ""peace"". How do you keep a reboot a float after two massively fun, popular and entertaining blockbusters? That's a lot one the plate of writer Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin, but they went for it and, if you can get past the worst female sub plot in the series history (Jayla: who delivers cliches the way Dominos delivers pizza: uncooked and often!) then it's what passes for todays' hit movie.Still loving our recurring characters and there slow development which trumps the original series... The adventures' circle was, once again, completed, and we do that Trekkie retrospective thing and then different actors read that famous post movie soliloquy.Here's hoping the next Star Trek movie goes where no other Star Trek movie has gone before, but if not, I'm betting it won't suck, but will disappoint a bunch of 65 years hoping to see William Shatner in a toupe du jour making our with some green chick while staying within the Gene Roddenbury paradox universe!"
" Poor script and plot and really quite tedious
",-0.4767,-0.3831,2017-12-21 00:00:00,2,"The combination of Justin Lin and Simon Pegg seem like the antithesis of who should write and direct a Star Trek movie.
Pegg is someone who has always reveled in cliché and bad plotting, often for comedic effect. Unfortunately for this film it just made it comically bad.
The whole script for the first half could probably be written on two sides of A4 and 50% of that would be exclamations as various crew dodge overblown CGI. A large part of the middle section of the film is a very dull space battle.The movie follows the formulaic good guys vs alien bad guy (why do all these movies feel the need to do this? can't something different or more nuanced be thought of?)
I can't think of any major plot holes, but the plot is so paper thin it would be impossible to put a hole in something so one dimensional.The cast are all good although Pegg writes himself a much larger part than his character or acting ability deserve.
I didn't expect much from this movie after seeing the previous two Star Trek movies, but I was still disappointed."
" Blows up Real Good
",0.4404,0.7575,2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"The original Star Trek was a 3-year TV Series. These big budget extravaganzas cost hundreds of millions as evidenced by the 5 movie studio's logos we have to sit through before the actual movie starts. Most of the action does not take place on the Enterprise the crew's penchant for destroying trillion dollar vessels seeming to continue as does Scotty's ability to get ancient relics back into space. Simon Pegg who plays Montgomery Scott had a hand in writing this one. Kirk, Bones and Spock are the essential trio and we learn of the death of Nimoy both in the script and in a memorial in the credits which also mention Anton on a first name basis only. The ability to survive space exploration does not extend to surviving old age or wonky earth technology. As the saying goes it blows up real good and in the movies sound still manages to travel through space."
" Star Trek goes Beyond Excellence
",0.6249,0.9877,2017-11-29 00:00:00,10,"Enjoyed the interaction & humor between Spock & McCoy; Kirk & Chekov. Love the opening scene with the gargoyles. Simon Pegg did a great job writing the screen play. Karl Urban as McCoy really shines in his role & is my favorite character in the new series. This one has more playful moments & that makes the movie the best one after Star Trek IV. Good plot, nasty villain & interesting planet people. Some great scenes with old star ships & previous crew. Fantastic movie, hope there is more to come."
" This movie tries to be a Star Trek movie
",0.0,0.561,2017-11-25 00:00:00,6,"This movie feels like it's been made by someone who's a Star Trek fan and the halfway through the movie he switched places with his twin brother who is an action movie fan. And the production mashed those two ideas together.The movie doesn't feel like a science fiction movie, it really doesn't. It feels like a space cowboy movie, like I'm expecting to see a cowboy riding a rocket in the air anytime I watch the movie.What really saves this movie is the stars, well the Enterprise crew to be more clear, the newcomers in this movie, I am awed by how much importance is given to people who we might never see again. The movie tries really hard to make them relevant but they aren't memorable enough, instead of using dialogue and information it uses shiny effects, fight scenes and voices to introduce them. Basically, they are written very poorly, you don't remember a character from some action scene that took movie magic to make, you remember them for their engaging stories and writing.So overall I think the biggest problem for the movie was the writing, it was too short and too vague. It feels like once there was a great script for this movie,then the director, producer and writer decided to read it in a cabin in the woods to avoid leaks and after reading it, they were so excited that they started drinking and got drunk and ran out of wood for the fire, then someone thought it was a good idea to throw the script in the fire. And the next day they panicked and wrote this half of a script to cover up the loss."
" Best Star Trek Movie

This movie made me want to watch more Star Trek. I will watch this again. So fun.

" If you're going to do SJW, do it right
",0.0,0.9827,2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I am going to stipulate that I don't personally appreciate the infusion of social justice indoctrination into movies these days. There's just too much #MaleToxicity and clumsy attempts at inclusiveness while trying to preserve diversity to suit my tastes. Honestly, it's very hard to do. And most movies don't get it right.Setting aside all the obvious and oft-cited reasons why this movie really wasn't a very god Star Trek movie, I want to talk about Gay Sulu for a minute. I would prefer the topic having not been brought up at all, but, as a writer, I see a missed opportunity in how it was handled. It could have been done better. Way better.Let's harken back to 1966 and enter a world where a black woman held a line officer rank and sat on the bridge with white men and held a position of prestige and respect. In 1966, Lt. Uhura was the hot button topic of social justice proffered by Gene. SJW is not new to Star Trek. Not by a long shot - even when Kirk was womanizing the galaxy. Uhura didn't just say ""hailing frequencies open."" She offered opinions. She disagreed and on one occasion, at least, she stood up to unfair treatment at the hands of her captain, who then apologized. The white male captain of a starship apologizing to a black woman on the bridge - in 1966, this was revolutionary. And important.Unlike sexual orientation, skin color and gender are pretty much impossible to hide. Uhura pierced the veil of ethnic and gender stereotypes to boldly proclaim that she was still a black woman and still a line officer in Starfleet. Both can be done at the same time. And this is the essential definition of inclusiveness and diversity.Fast forward to 2017 and we see a quaint reunion of Gay Sulu with his family in a picture perfect moment that looks like they just met at Disneyland. A checkbox was marked off with a sideways glance to the Alphabet Rainbow, but the humanity of what this really means was completely lost.Anybody who has been to sea knows that reunions are difficult. It is like meeting a familiar stranger when the sea coughs you back up on shore and thrusts you into the arms of loved ones. He's been at sea for two years. The proclamation here should have been, ""I am Gay Sulu and I am a man faced with the same trials and tribulations as any family man returning from his ship. It is no different for me."" There could have been a tense moment of uncertainty when he and his lover are looking at each other, wondering if they are still the same, if they haven't lost something to those years in space. He could have looked down at his daughter and said, ""My, how you've grown."" She could have looked back at him sadly and said, ""You're still the same."" And then they could wander off, uncertainty hanging over them like a cloud. Will this family survive the ardors of one of its members being a man at sea? Oh my, would you look at that? A meaningful subplot.Instead, we get a very tasteful and subtle acknowledgment of Gay Sulu without exploring what that means in any way except to say something along the lines of ""This is acceptable,"" which is an insult, really. It would be like telling Uhura that it's OK for black women to be line officers. Oh, really? Gee, thanks. Legitimize it by dramatizing it. Gay Sulu could have been controversial with meaning, not just controversial and trite. Seems to me the writers missed an opportunity at classic Star Trek social commentary. Instead, we got something that was less than patronizing.Or, to put it in short form: Don't try to do risky social commentary (which requires a significant realignment of canon) if all you're making is Fast And Furious in Space."
" We will find hope in the impossible.
",0.4404,0.9695,2017-10-31 00:00:00,7,"May contain plot spoilers if you never watched a Star Trek episode before.Kirk and Spock go out of character. Trouble in a nebula...it's a trap! Kirk and company save the universe. Enterprise destroyed. New one in the making, been there done that, forgo the t-shirt. Kirk and Spock return to character.This is third in the series of a re-boot. The characters were less like their 60's counterparts than the other two films. The movie has gotten darker and antagonists like Harry Mudd and Clint Howard have been replaced with torture and agony. The changes correspond to the modern demographic which wants more hard core action and less drama, forgetting viewers like me who like the lighter Star Trek moralistic scripts. Wouldn't the crew visit the same planets and fight off the same invaders as before...like they did with Khan? Just saying. I could imagine creative script creating the same scenario, solving issues differently while using the same dialogue in a different manner. But that would require intelligent creative writing.Our bad guy is a forgotten warrior who is against the Federation (not NATO) and diversity. His name is not Trump, but the political message of peace through diversity ekes out at the end. No clever lines like, ""I am black on the right side!"" The film, while entertaining, has lost it's creative comic moralistic edge in favor formula writing and special effects.I liked it, but was still disappointed in what it could have been."
" Story is so weak with so many unreasonable plot
",-0.5777,0.8468,2017-10-29 00:00:00,5,"So many weakness in the movie. Some that I could point out right away:1. Is it that easy to trust some random alien gal to send your best star ship to go for a rescue mission??2. The bee swarm is so exaggerated. Could be millions. Where the hell did Krall put them in the planet?3. Krall's bees could wreck havoc Yorktown easily! Which was actually displayed on screen. Why would Krall need that relic in the first place?4. Surprising that Yorktown as an advanced space station with civilians doesn't have any bomb for defensive weapon! Or any other advanced defense mechanism aside from single target weak lasers.5. When the Enterprise was destroyed, I was worried that the characters couldn't land on an habitable planet with perfect atmosphere to sustain live, but thankfully they could land safely in such planet. Which happen to be nearby, which happen to have another Enterprise, which happen to have a bike, and also a large boombox! What a relieve!6. Music to beat the villains??! I was surprised that I thought I was watching Mars Attack remake this whole time or I hoped that I mistakenly went to, perhaps a 'Star Track' movie, some kind of parody of 'Star Trek'. I had to check my ticket again. Unfortunately it was indeed Star Trek.For a high budgeted Hollywood movie, I would expect something more to be honest. Like, a lot more. Personally I think it has a weak and lazy story line. I still hope I watched the wrong movie though."
" An improvement over the first two movies
",0.4588,0.9949,2017-10-19 00:00:00,4,"On the plus side, Star Trek Beyond is easily the best of the three ""JJ Trek"" movies. The premise is actually quite good, there are some good dialogues and neat visuals in this movie. The team seems to have learned from the shortcomings of the first two movies which passed for a caricature of the original Star Trek at best and lacked both atmosphere and much of a story to tell. It is in this third of the so called Calvin timeline movies that the cast actually delivers some good renditions of the original characters because they are finally put in situations that fit into Star Trek. Maybe they also needed some time to grow into their roles. It seemed to be somewhat naive and ill-conceived to expect us to appreciate new actors in new interpretations of established characters when it took the original cast three seasons of a TV show plus a decade of being hyped in the fan community until their characters worked on the big screen. JJ Trek still looks pale and uninspired to me but at least Star Trek Beyond finally managed to develop it into a good direction.But even in this movie JJ Trek is at best light entertainment. The beginning feels odd, you don't buy the long years the crew is supposed to be out there on startrekish missions. And the sudden destruction of the ship by a deus-ex-machina-like force feels misplaced and throws the movie off the rails within the first ten minutes. What is taking place on that planet is actually a nice little adventure but doesn't really have the weight to fill a full-length movie. In the 90s, people used to complain that while the TNG movie Insurrection was a quite good Star Trek story with good moments, it felt more than an episode of a TV show than a full-lengh movie. What on earth is Star Trek Beyond then?The movie grossed less at the box office than the first two movies and ended up being a losing bargain for Paramount. This is probably unjustified since they clearly put the greatest creative effort of the three into this movie. But again, that doesn't really mean that much nowadays."
" Here we go again. Another Hollywood Quick Edit/Fast Cut, CGI, Action, Cliché, Zero Acting, Unoriginal, Candy for the Mindless
",-0.6124,-0.992,2017-10-02 00:00:00,1,"I'm a big fan of the original 60s TV Star Trek. They are great B TV at its best. Given the budget, it was great. Great characters, great acting, great music, great scenes. Some of the stories were weak, but the characters and acting were always great.I did not like any of the Star Trek movies, or any of the other Star Trek TV series. The costumes, sets, music, stories in the movies all sucked. Even though Wrath of Kahn had some decent scenes, it was also subpar compared to the original TV series. New Generation with Picard and the stupid Klingon makeup and all the stupid uniforms, all look like a retarded soap opera.Now the reboots. If you watch these without much thinking, you could give this movie a passing grade, maybe a 7. The first movie was the best, the 2nd not so good, now the 3rd movie, this is a joke. They are entertaining while watching. But, be careful, if you think too hard you may regret it. These movies are not for the thinking. They are for the told. They tell you how to think.All the characters are copy cliché of the original series. Bones and Spock have a scene where they are on the planet, Spock is wounded, and they have a conversation about Spock leaving the Starfleet, and him leaving Uhura and going to New Vulcan. This is a freaking joke. Take a look at their circumstance. They are stranded on a planet, everybody else may be dead, Spock is seriously hurt, maybe dying, and this is the conversation they are having. Unbelievable!!!!!!! We have a scene on the new Enterprise (Franklin or whatever the F*** it was called, where Kirk (Jerk) asks Sulu if he can fly the ship. And Sulu answers: ""Are you kidding, Sir"" – What the hell is that. Tons of garbage dialogue like this. Especially from Bones to Spock.There's a scene where Kirk/Jerk and Cerkoff are skidding down the side of the Enterprise and they survive. Tons of crappy scenes where these ""humans"" should be dead, but no, they survive because maybe they are not human, maybe they're the new superheros. I don't mind CGI, they are basically cartoons on the computer. What I do mind is no story, no acting garbage.So, you want to watch some Star Trek, go see the TV series."
" Just one more
",0.0,0.7814,2017-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Star Trek Beyond has stepped up their cinematography team with the amazing graphics as well as the scenery in the extra-terrestrial planets. The beginning of the film starts like all others although I did find it thrilling and exciting, it was a bit cliché as it was the classical chase scene because they've done something wrong and they are facing imminent death. Further through the film it grew in potential however it was more like good vs evil as it was fight, retaliation, fight and so on. It was pretty much an intergalactic boxing match with some cool weapons, you can see the clear division between now and the originals, it feel like it was lacking some plot to it. Now I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it as a film because it did grip me, it's just that it lacked in some areas of production and planning.

" Loved it!
",0.636,0.9981,2017-09-28 00:00:00,9,"After seeing so many negative reviews, I decided to upload one because I actually loved this movie. I thought it was so good that I saw it twice in cinemas (the first and only time I've ever seen a movie more than once in cinemas). Note: I'm speaking as a person who has seen the original series, the original movies and the new alternate reality movies.I was quite intrigued by the plot/story line because it took into account some things I hadn't really considered before when watching Star Trek, such as Kirk's uncertainty about what he's trying to achieve and the interesting twist where the smaller the ship (the swarm), the more powerful it is (against the Enterprise). Destroying the ship, although it has been done before in previous films, was a good idea for this film in my opinion. In the last two movies, we see how the ship is basically what brings the crew together and gives them strength against their enemies. For them to be without it tests the bonds within the crew.I like how the crew was separated into different groups; Uhura and Sulu, Kirk and Chekov – we almost saw a father/son relationship, Spock and McCoy – we saw their dislike for each other but ultimately their need for one another. When they're in these pairs and later when they come together again, you can really see the comradery within the crew, each person contributing something and looking out for each other.On a side note, I'm glad they moved the Enterprise away from Earth – it would have bored me if the fight was on Earth for a third time after the last two movies.The extra bit of humor in the film was like the 'cherry on top' for me; I had fun watching it.I liked the new character; Jaylah. I think Boutella did a great job – you could see such strength and fierceness but also the innocence and vulnerability of her. Elba as Krall was also not bad but slightly forgettable.I'm not particularly taken with the angle that this new series has chosen for Spock. I'm not sure if it's because I've gotten used to Nimoy's Spock, who is mostly devoid of any emotion. I just felt uncertain in the scene when Spock was crying and then laughing. But I guess that's what the writers consider as half-human/half-vulcan.After seeing what I think was a bit too much action/explosion in Into Darkness, this one toned it down a little bit, which I was satisfied with. My favourite sequence was the Enterprise destruction because of the fact that it caught the Enterprise off-guard in the most unexpected way and the tension kept me at the edge of my seat when I saw the crew struggling to hold the swarm off.Visual/Special effects were great. Make-up was fantastic as well. And I love the slight alteration of the Starfleet uniform and the new 'survival' suits.Michael Giacchino is incredible. I love the music he has already composed for the series and it just seems to get better. We still get to hear both the Star Trek theme from the original series as well as Giacchino's new one since Star Trek (2009). And now Giacchino has composed a few new themes, my favourites from this movie being ""Night on the Yorktown"" and ""Crash Decisions"". The sequence of the Enterprise entering Yorktown was extraordinary; the combination of visuals and grand music just made me feel like I was melting in my seat. It was amazing.I think this is a great film. I walked in the cinema so excited to see another installment and I was thrilled throughout the whole movie. I recommend it to both Star Trek fans and those who know nothing about the series (although I suggest you do a tad bit of research before actually watching it). I also recommend you watch this film open-minded with no strict expectations, eg. It's not ideal to watch it if you're a hardcore Trekkie expecting it to be like past Star Trek films/TV episodes. I think it's better than Into Darkness, it's possibly on par with Star Trek (2009) but I can't say because they both have a very different atmosphere. Overall, it made me feel somewhat like I was watching an episode from the original series."
" Spectacular Effects but Its' Predecessors Were Better Entertainers
",0.7469,0.9798,2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"I think what was sorely missed in this Star Trek was direction by JJ Abrams. The movie entertains well but it doesn't hook you as much as Star Trek(2009) or Star Trek Into Darkness(2013). Maybe the absence of their script writers(Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman) could also be a factor, their script really drew me into the Star Trek world. In this movie, the visuals and the effects as hoped were spectacular but as a total package, it dips despite even the presence of the same cast - Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin. They all are still good but this dynamic team just didn't feel the same without Abrams around. They sparkled with him at the wheel. Also, Zoe Saldana's role this time was much weaker and that was a let down. So, I would have rated this paler Star Trek a 7 but I will give it a star more for the visual excellence and also some spirited performances from rest of the cast, Sofia Boutella and Idris Alba. Verdict: a disappointment if compared to the earlier works but still, a clean, good sci-fi entertainment."

" Star Trek takes a step into the future
",0.0,0.9972,2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"As crazy as my title sounds, it's actually very apt..., looking back at the original Star Treks, they're starting to look old, for a futuristic show it sure is like stepping back into the past. However, with Star Trek Beyond, the Star Trek universe looks futuristic once again, spectacular action sequences and outlandish locations..., this is the Star Trek we all thought we loved, but it's only now we can actually say we love it. Where no man has gone before..., until now, the crew of the starship enterprise is attacked by a gang of unknown aliens, rendering them stranded on an exotic planet unknown to the federation..., many of the lesser crew perish, but our heroes survive albeit getting split up and separated in the process. What follows is a very modern action/sci-fi flick that is attractive to the casual viewer, but somewhat alienates the die hard Trekkie's..., less Star Trek, more modern blockbuster..., obviously the casual viewer isn't clever enough to keep up with the gist of ""real"" Star Trek, so it's toned down a lot. The casting is pretty much the same as the previous two films in the series, albeit this was the last film ever made by the late Anton Yelchin who plays the ever reliable Mr. Chekov..., where the series goes from here is a mystery; they can either stay faithful to the original series by replacing Yelchin with a new Chekov, or they can throw the book out of the window and kill the character off completely, either way the next film will suffer from fan backlash. Did I enjoy Beyond or didn't I? Difficult question, if it were a stand alone film then yes I enjoyed it very much, but as it's part of the Star Trek universe, I can honestly say I was very disappointed, as a life long Trekkie I don't like how they're trying to make the series mainstream..., Star Trek has a cult following and should appeal only to it's true fans, not the wider audience. My personal favourite was Captain Kirk played by the amazing Chris Pine, the guy at least embodied the spirit of William Shatner, giving an extra kick to the iconic character, making him new again and breathe again, while staying true to the original, for that I can't fault the actor..., just a shame the film's crew didn't share the same sentiment. Yes Star Trek Beyond is most certainly deserved of a watch, as a casual viewer you'll love it, as a true Trekkie you won't, a bit like marmite to be honest."

LMAO!!! - The 'Bad Guy' wanting that silly artifact to go out and conquer... when he already had swarms of ships that easily destroyed the Enterprise literally within a couple of minutes and could surely destroy an entire fleet just as easily - surely he didn't need the artifact for anything other than a plot point. Going into warp after the swarm destroyed the deflector dish??? Not possible according to canon Star Trek canon. Utter idiocy.Having to drop the U.S.S.

It mentions him serving as Executive Officer on the Enterprise NCC- 1701-A, I thought he took a vow never to reveal information about the future? also - it says he was 'second officer' lol, wow - I thought he was first officer!???... guess these guys knows better though.Fitting the Enterprise crew (430 people by TOS numbers into the tiny USS Franklin?) - Granted, a there were some casualties, but he only used the transporter a few times - (at 20 people each time, but it looked like ten each time to me lol, go back and watch), none of it made any sense to be honest.The Yorktown Space Station - I'll just pretend that there was a time travel adventure going on at Yorktown space station. What a wacky place.Presumably Edison was aboard the Franklin when it crashed, and at some point abandoned it in favor of his HQ. So okay, Jaylah subsequently manages to ""cloak"" the ship, but Edison/Krall already knows where it is, unless he's forgotten at some point, or Jaylah somehow managed to move the ship without attracting any notice, which seems unlikely.Kirk and Chekov were able to shoot through the glass on the bridge of the Enterprise so easily with hand phasers? I would hate to see what would happen to the bridge if they took a direct hit from a full sized ship. I find it even more dubious that they were able to ignite all of the saucer's thrusters after the crash the entire saucer was on fire and mangled.The Enterprise was sent through the Nebula and Asteroids because it was the only ship that had sensors capable enough... Yet the archaic Franklin makes it through just fine, with no shields even??? lmao. There are many more things that ruin this movie, but mainly, the plot just sucked, and when the fans know more about Star Trek than the people making the movies, it's time to just shelve the project. You guys had all had a decent chance to make something great happen with these three movies, but you have really blown it. As of now - the 'New' Star Trek you guys are doing is DEAD to me.Try watching 'Star Trek Continues' on YouTube - That series done by dedicated fans BLOWS this tripe away, learn something from them."
" Fast and Furious in space
",-0.5719,0.9225,2017-08-18 00:00:00,3,"I have watched every single episode of Star Trek TOS, Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager and Enterprise. I enjoyed each series for various reasons. I have seen all the movies several times over. The reboot of Star Trek is a disappointment. Here is a summary for them- mad Romulan disrupts the timeline, mad former dictator kills people, mad left behind former officer wages a private war with the federation. I'm detecting a pattern. The action scenes in the latest movie are so shaky as to make watching almost uncomfortable. I have always liked action movies, but it just gets taken too far. The plots of all the movies could use more of what made Star Trek a great franchise, the human condition. The only positive about the reboot is the banter between McCoy and Spock. They bicker like an old married couple. I do like the character of Jaylah. She kind of reminds me of Denise Crosby's Tasha Yar character. Hopefully, she won't be forgotten if and when there might be another movie in the series. All I can say so far is meh for the reboot."
" Amazing how durable these ST characters are
",0.5859,0.9972,2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"I see from reading the other reviews that the comments are really polarized. I can understand a rating of (say) 6/10 if you concentrate on the plot (it's really just a space western with full big-screen production values), but 1/10?? No. (""I'm a troll, hear my voice"").This one was a lot of fun, pure and simple. The bedrock here is the crew of the Enterprise -- Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, Sulu. Seeing them play out their usual roles through another cliffhanging storyline is like dropping in to see a bunch of old friends again; it's comfortable and welcoming and you know they'll all get through. Somehow this group of characters has amazing appeal and durability that has now spanned more than half a century. If this was exactly the same movie but NOT in the Star Trek universe and not with the same characters, it just wouldn't have the same appeal.The visuals and special effects are tops (as of last year, I'd rate them the best I've seen, period. Star Wars needs to up their game. The big space station ""Yorktown"" was a highlight. And the new alien-ally Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) was great -- she gets my vote for ""most convincing humanoid alien makeup"" with her beautifully rendered white-skin-with-black-accents and hair. I hope they bring her back.If you like these characters at all, this is more than worth your time. The overall plot arc is pretty conventional (as are most other ST movies) but the scene-by-scene details will carry you along just fine."
" Not a classic, but certain to entertain
",0.185,0.9659,2017-08-04 00:00:00,7,"J.J. Abrams has left the building and frequent Fast & Furious director Justin Lin takes the helm. Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the gang are back in this third film of the rebooted/re-imagined/alternate-universe Star Trek film franchise, which this time was written by Simon Pegg (Scotty). The film's set up seems right out of an old TV episode, which is very cool. The Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission, which ends up being an ambush and leaves them stranded and separated on an alien planet. This gives Spock and Bones lots of opportunities to verbally spar, Kirk and Chekov get to work together to survive, and best of all Scotty teams up with a plucky alien lady played by Sofia Boutella. Their nemesis is a very menacing Idris Elba as Krall. This entry is filled with loads of action for the summer blockbuster crowd, but is also smart enough to please the comic-con crowd. Overall it's not a classic, but it's certain to entertain and hard to resist (insert Borg joke here)."
" Inferior to previous Star Trek
",-0.4019,-0.8537,2017-07-31 00:00:00,3,"Into Darkness is light years ahead of Beyond. Something about this new one is very shallow, empty.It had potential, but is dull. Apart from a simplistic narrative, there's basic camera issues - cramped, shots too tight and many scenes too chaotic. flashes of jumbled visuals. hyperactive editing."
" Looks good, but lots of big chaos and loud noise and no brains or soul
",-0.7845,0.9835,2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,"While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.Although the 21st century reboot 'Star Trek' reboot films were positively received by critics, they're much more divisive on IMDb with a lot of vehement dislike against all three. Then again, to some degree all the 'Star Trek' films seem to have a polarising response here. With me, 'Star Trek' (2009), 'Into Darkness' and 'Beyond' have some great strengths but they have a lot of faults too. Of which 'Beyond' is the weakest, after seeing a review cite it as the best 'Star Trek' film since 'The Wrath of Khan' (after seeing it have to strongly disagree with that claim). Despite being a very disappointing 'Star Trek' film, 'Into Darkness' fared reasonably as an action film and had a great villain, neither distinctions are present to me with 'Beyond'.Visually, 'Star Trek Beyond' does look great. The special effects especially are fantastic, and there is some impressive make-up, bold and atmospheric use of colour that just dazzles, audacious and suitably moody cinematography, production design that leaves one in awe and atmospheric lighting. At least finally the lens flares that were so distracting before have been reigned in.Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.Thrills, tension and excitement come in spades here, but at least there is some. Enough of the casting works too. Chris Pine is commanding and charismatic as Kirk and has grown more confident and relaxed with each instalment. Zachary Quinto once again nails it as Spock, with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Karl Urban is suitably cantankerous, Zoe Saldana is sexy and fiery and the tribute to Leonard Nimoy is moving. Knowing that it was Anton Yelchin's last film before his ultimely death is also heart-wrenching. Oh and Sofia Boutella was a great addition too.Unfortunately, 'Star Trek Beyond' shares very similar problems with 'Star Trek Into Darkness', except that the action sequences are vastly inferior here, some of it feeling drawn out and like it belonged more in a video game. The script has some clunky moments, has comedy that really doesn't gel and is not very funny and fails to provoke much thought or have much depth, most of it feels very dumbed down.Characterisation-wise, too many of the characters are one-dimensional and underused, especially the villain. This is a real disappointment because the interesting characters and their interactions and conflicts were what made 'Star Trek' at its best so good, something that was mostly lost in all three of Abrams' rebooted films but especially here. Was really disappointed in Idris Elba, a fine actor who tries his best but is criminally under-utilised and Elba struggles to do anything with the role, almost over-parted.'Star Trek Beyond' particularly fails in the story. It takes forever to get going and is both dumbed-down and soulless in spirit, even worse is the inconsistencies, frequent lapses in logic, parts that don't make sense and a story that is too often a dull, over-baked and convoluted mess. While the spectacle is done well, the action is not done well and the lack of characterisation and good writing robs the film once again of heart and soul. Again, it is all big, noisy and chaotic but the lack of brains, the inability to treat its audience with respect, lack of emotional investment and that it feels so soulless really bring the film down.Overall, despite looking good 'Star Trek Beyond' is the weakest of the re-boot films and to me one of the weaker 'Star Trek' films, the weakest since 'Nemesis' anyhow. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" I want my money back - 'The Swarm' - again.
",0.0772,-0.9739,2017-07-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie recycles the same basic 'Trek' formula that has been re- hashed since 'The Motion Picture'. (from the textbook) MOVIE PLOT 1a: Alien wants to destroy Earth or other person or property (substitute Enterprise or planet or ship or person as needed) for its own selfish purposes. With a countdown to destruction at the end, that of course will be thwarted at the very last second and only ever at the very last second. (This movie stole the plot idea straight from the Voyager episode 'The Swarm') Do we ever really think for one second the good guys wouldn't succeed? That's not even the point, at least make me feel like there is something at stake, make me care that they must stop this before time is up. Even though Star Wars had the countdown, I actually cared about the destruction of the Death Star and watching them attempting to blow it up was exciting the first couple times watching it.1. V'ger - countdown to Earth's destruction 2. Kahn - countdown to Genesis explosion 3. Klingons - literal self-destruct countdown and also to Genesis planet destruction 4. Alien probe - countdown to Earth's destruction 5. we don't talk about this movie 6. Klingons - countdown to assassination 7. Soren - countdown to missile launch 8. Borg - countdown to self-destruct missile-ship launch 9. Sona - countdown to collector launch (planet destruction) 10. Romulans - countdown to Thaleron firing 11. Romulans - countdown to Earth destruction 12. Kahn - countdown to Ship's destruction (enemy ship restoring power) 13. Stupid alien guy - countdown to whatever (weapon launch) I'm trying to block it from my mind. 2 hours of my life wasted on such garbage. I think the 3D tix were like $30. The ending truly hurt me. That Rock n' Roll will save the universe message, I cringe just thinking about it. The Enterprise flying among the ships blasting the 'Beastie's' destroying the ships with Rock n' Roll music. Hold on... Okay I'm back, I just had to go and puke my guts out. What a stupid movie. It really has nothing going for it. It did nothing for the Franchise or overall story arc. At least the other films filled in the blanks with some interesting talk or action, this movie puts a stupid motorcycle chase in there for no reason. When I saw the trailer I was hoping it would work somehow, but the motorcycle part just looked totally contrived and not interesting in any way.Every action flick since 'Goldfinger' has had to have a countdown to create false tension. The Bat Man movies, every action film. Someone name me an action film that doesn't have some countdown to a bomb or whatever, please. I'd love to see it. Even 'Star Wars' has the countdown to the Death Star. Every single 'Star Trek' movie follows this basic formula. This is the worst Star Trek movie since V 'The Final Frontier'. Compared to that trash, this makes 'V' look like an actual film. This is the last 'Trek' I will be wasting my good money on. When I first heard about it and how it was going to be about the '5 year mission' - I thought great, it might be a little like first episodes of the Original Series. Exploring unknown space and meeting new aliens and civilizations. Was I very wrong."

I dared to watch it and I was pleasantly surprised. Amidst lots of action and explosions Justin Lin takes the time to develop the characters as well as their relationships. Simon Pegg and the other authors managed to create a genuine Star Trek story that pays a lot of respect to the original franchise, the fans and the original actors. It seems that in this installment the main actors have ""found"" their characters, their own approach, yet they managed to give us at least a hint of the original performances. Especially Chris Pine convinced me with a much more mature James T. Kirk with a lot of William Shatner moves. Idris Elba managed to give the main villain character an extraordinary depth, leading up to his reveal and demise perfectly.A movie that is a very respectful homage to 50 years of Star Trek, entertaining and with a few nice twists. And a step away from stupid western gunmen of the previous movies, back to an ingenious trio that smarts out the bad guys of the galaxy. And believe it or not - the movie even had a Star Trek theme.So that's how it's done: Dump that overgrown child without any imagination, hire a real director and some decent writers and you have a good franchise movie."

Sadly my instincts were right.Overdone CGI. WHen I say overdone I mean WAY overdone. Like they were in a contest to see how much CGI they could cram into 2 hours. If there is one thing about ST it's ""less is more"", not ""massively overloading your brain with irrelevant CGI is better"".Literally dozens of implausible / impossible scenarios. People falling off of high places uninjured (repeatedly), sliding down wrecked passageways without a scratch (repeatedly), getting in fistfights/shootouts with no injuries (repeatedly) heck even sliding down the entire outside of the wrecked saucer section of the Enterprise and merely ""jumping off"" at the end with no injuries. Laughably overdone filler. Lazy dialogue. Weak humor throughout.Kirk somehow comes up with a retro motorcycle that he uses to go rescue his crew. Yes. A motorcycle magically appears on an alien planet across the galaxy from earth where a motorcycle probably hasn't even existed in over 200 years. And, he just shows up riding it out of nowhere. No explanation of where he found it or where it came from. Ridiculous. We are also supposed to believe that they were able to revive a crash landed Federation ship from decades earlier, and rev the impulse engines enough to drop it off a high cliff to gain speed, where it hits rock outcroppings and mountains on the way down with NO damage to itself or crew and it still flies perfectly! And it's not until near the end of the movie that we find out that the arch enemy is a former Federation captain. This should have come out much sooner to add to what pathetic amount of a story line they had form the start.To make a long story short, this movie may have finally killed off what was left of the ST franchise and that's probably a good thing."

The giant battle between the Enterprise and the swarm during the first half hour, as well as the big finale, were both awesome and the highlights of the movie. The general concept of a swarm of small battle ships rather than a big one, makes a lot more sense. And the way they defeated them was fun. The special effects were great, the performances were great, I liked the new character Jaylah, and the villains were good enough, I understood their motivations. However, somewhere in the middle the movie slowed a bit down. I understand if people find the movie a bit episodic, but I think the hate is unjustified.

This one jumps the shark. During both my attempted viewings the scene with Kirk riding the motorcycle caused to me to stop watching. Im sorry Star Trek, while having some cool action scenes, was always more cerebral than action oriented. That is why it is such a huge phenomenon, any fool can right some half witted script with mostly action. Star Trek writing was better and more thought provoking.

They manage to stay this side of respect and don't descend into burlesque with their performances.I kind of like the way the aliens seem to attack in a swarm like a hive of angry hornets. And I do like the way that some ancient earth music was used to disrupt their communication.Of course this film was marred by the post completion death of Anton Yelchin who played Ensign Chekhov here.

This is the Magnum Opus of sold out trash filmmaking. Whoever was responsible for approving the script and the plot should be fired and spend the rest of their life testing experimental varieties of sandpaper for use as toilet paper.The story is obvious and painfully boring, but that is not what made it so worthless. When the action sequences commence, they do not simply propose that you suspend disbelief: they shout in your face that physics is optional and best ignored. This is supposed to be a Star Trek movie, it even has the name, but there is no trace of intelligence or science here. I'm tempted to write a laundry list of the horrific violations of physics here, but I don't want to risk spoilers. Trust me, anyone who can watch this without noticing the awful stupidity of any character living through the first hour has checked out of reality completely. If your only interest is flashing lights and loud noises, you can probably stomach this crap, but leave behind any expectations of worthwhile story: Star Trek has historically drawn from the paradoxes created by expansion and exploration; the conflict between developed and exploited societies, and the character studies brought about by the emptiness of deep space and strange adventure. Instead of those things, all you get here is explosions, cheap jokes, and fight scenes. They might as well replace the iconic orchestra scores with rock music and dress the actors in swimsuits and bikinis.This movie probably made millions and millions of dollars, which makes me sad for us all. It is only worthy of use as an example of what not to do in filmmaking. I will only return to viewing these movies if trusted sources assure me ahead of time that the franchise has jetissoned the hyper nonsense and is again well written and intelligent."

No one could play him like Leonard Nimoy, but Zachary Quinto was a poor substitute. Reboot-Spock is far more emotional than any seemingly logical creature should be. So if you only watched the Original Star Trek for Spock, you may find yourself disappointed.But back to the positives: Pine pulled a magnificent Shatner at his best in this film. Seriously. I would be happy to put either captain back into the chair. Uhura is as always awesome, Chekov and Sulu are cool, and really? I would watch this movie over and over.The plot line was a little shaky, the villain a little ridiculous. But that is Star Trek.

Yes, they don't get the high media attention like the Star Wars ones, but still that doesn't mean that you should just ignore them. If you are into science-fiction this is a must watch.This movie takes place a couple of years after the previous one, but no need to watch the first two as this can be watched a stand alone movie. Although it's not directed by J.J.Abrams, the spirit of the first two is still present in here and there is also a bit of the Fast & Furious spirit thanks to Justin Lin's direction; plus that motorbike chase.. gives no doubts at all.All characters are back and their story continues. In this case it takes a bit to understand who the bad guy is but the reason behind being the bad guy is pretty clear, not a big surprise there, which I think is the weak point of the movie, that the reason behind all the action is too normal. In this movie we feel like we are in an Avengers movie: action scenes after actions scenes, but in space instead of in Earth, and even some long time chases, which are pretty cool as this director is an expect in that subject and they are always a breath of fresh air when done correctly, which they are in this movie.The movie is really entertaining and although the bad guy might be not bad enough, and his reason to be is something usual (yes, we want something more bad-ass) the movie is really entertaining, plus those visual effects are always magnificent and that 60s nostalgia is always present."

Indeed as far as Star Trek goes, these films simply aren't Trek. To a degree the same can be said about the older movie efforts, since they all tried to push characters into extremes that didn't fit the series. Just think about Picard in Star Trek: First Contact, and how he's a rash, emotional, PTSD-ridden Borg-survivor, instead of the calm, thoughtful and tactical thinker he is in TNG.But it can be argued that these movies may be better enjoyed as pure action films. Just imagine that the title reads ""Space Journey"" - the characters won't remind you too much of the originals anyway aside from the name and the phrases they use.But even that doesn't work here. From a villain with no motivation, to the tired use of yet another McGuffin, to action scenes that are as over the top as they are confusing to watch.A scene that's supposed to be weightful and fill us with dramatic anticipation, complete with music swelling and Catpain Kirk doing his best ""I really care about this""-impression, yet the viewer feels absolutely nothing, except maybe the vibration of your phone if you're lucky enough to have some distraction handy.This movie has a plot completely devoid of thought, elaborate action scenes that are beautifully rendered yet shot in an extremely confusing and tiring way, and the attempts to give what happens on the screen some emotional weight fall completely flat.The drab, unremarkable and primitive new ""Star Trek"" theme by Michael Giacchino is a good fit for a flat and unintelligent action movie, which is to say it's equally boring despite trying so very, very hard.This movie is a good example how the arts don't always move forward. We've regressed, and yet lots of people enjoy it and even apply labels such as ""thoughtful"" and ""deep"". ""Who cares, it's just meant to be entertaining"" - the tired old excuse for terrible movies. It's just that: An excuse. Don't fall for it. Don't accept bad films just because, oh well, ""it's just a fun movie"".This is not a fun movie. Not unless you shut off your brain. Why should one have to do that?To quote a much better movie: ""No! You're the ruler of the galaxy! Show a little taste!"""

Basically the the USS Enterprise is three years into its five year exploration mission, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is finding it hard to find meaning in this unending journey to find new worlds and new civilisations, Kirk applies for a promotion to vice admiral; recommending Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) as his replacement. Meanwhile Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) reunites with his family, Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (Simon Pegg) works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and Nyota Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana) end their relationship, soon after Spock receives word that the elderly Spock from the original timeline has died. The Enterprise is dispatched on a rescue mission to an uncharted nebula, on the planet Altamid they find Kalara (Lydia Wilson, voiced by Sara Forsberg) who claims to be stranded, but the ship is swarmed by an ambush of smaller ships, the leader Krall (Idris Elba) and his crew cripple the Enterprise attempting to find the Abronath, a relic recently obtained by Kirk. Krall captures and removes many crew members, while the Enterprise is cut into pieces, Kirk orders the crew to abandon ship, the remains of the ship crash on Altamid, Sulu, Uhura and other survivors are captured by Krall, Kirk and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) trick Kalara into revealing she is one of Krall's spies, they then escape Krall's soldiers, and Kalara is crushed by the saucer they flip over in the process. Elsewhere on the planet, a wounded Spock and Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) search for other survivors, Spock tells McCoy he plans to leave Starfleet to continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Scott is rescued by Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), a scavenger who previously escaped from Krall, she takes him to her home, early Starfleet vessel the USS Franklin that went missing and was grounded over a century ago. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock, they repair the Franklin and use Jaylah's technology to transport the crew aboard, then escape Altamid. Alien crew member Ensign Syl (Melissa Roxburgh) is coerced by Krall to hand over the Abronath that she kept hidden for Kirk, then she is dissolved, the missing half is an ancient bio-weapon, Krall intends to use the completed device to attack Yorktown and kill its inhabitants, before going on to attack the Federation. The Enterprise pursues Krall in the Franklin, the deduce radio signals are used by the swarm to coordinate attacks, Scott transports Spock and McCoy into one of the swarm ships, while the swarm's frequency is jammed and disorientated by broadcasting loud rock music over the channels, destroying almost the entire fleet, Krall flees into the starbase. Uhura and Kirk discover from logs that Krall is actually Balthazar Edison, the former captain of the Franklin, he cooperated with former enemies of the Federation, he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used technology of the extinct natives to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, thinking the Federation abandoned them, Edison plans to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into Yorktown's ventilation system, where Edison activates the bio- weapon, but before it can be unleashed Kirk ejects Edison and the bio-weapon, Edison is disintegrated and the weapon is lost forever, Kirk is saved by Spock and McCoy moments before he is also blown into space. In the end, the unsolved cases of Captain Edison and the USS Franklin crew are closed by Commodore Paris (Shohreh Aghdashloo), Kirk decides to remain captain, and Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet, Jaylah is accepted into Starfleet Academy on Kirk's recommendation, the crew celebrate Kirk's birthday an the new USS Enterprise is completed, they depart on their next mission to boldly go where no man has gone before. Also starring Joe Taslim as Manas, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Commander Finnegan and Deep Roy as Keenser. Pine, Quinto, Saldana, Pegg and the rest of the cast remain suited to their well-known roles, Elba is a bit underused as the villain, and there you can appreciate Yelchin in his last film appearance before his tragic death in a car accident, there is also tribute paid to Leonard Nimoy who died, the story is interesting enough to follow, action sequences are exciting, and the special effects get better and better, all in all it is a worthwhile science- fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Very good!"
" I Enjoyed Myself Just Fine Watching This Star Trek Movie.
",0.6249,0.975,2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Star Trek Beyond does inherit some of the problems of the previous reboot films: there's no lying around that. But it does work as a piece of entertainment that reminds fans why they fell in love with Gene Roddenberry's space opera magnum-opus in the first place. It's still got exploration, character-driven story and chemistry that we've grown to love, but the problem with this movie is that it sometimes wants to pretend it's NOT Star Trek. You can tell Justin Lin directed this movie: there's borderline Looney-Tunes-physics like grabbing onto a cliff before an escape-pod falls off the edge of it. Characters running away from a collapsing starship and JUST BARELY dodging the debris; talk about lucky. But even taking the wackiness into account, it's easily better than the OTHER evenly numbered Star Trek movies before the JJ Abrams lot.The one thing that's wrong with this movie: we'll never see Anton Yelchin as Chekov again. Rest in peace Anton. We miss you. And you too Leonard Nimoy. Live long and prosper; to both of you."

The plot was odd and not particularly deep. I get that. For me, however, it was the interactions between the characters that entertained me the most. By this point, the characters are all comfortable and familiar enough with each other to have some fun interactions. I loved seeing Spock and Bones in scenes together. Very entertaining. I wasn't expecting this to be more than a fun, action filled movie, so I was satisfied with it. It kept my attention. The action was intense and the whole thing looked gorgeous. I'm sure many people can enjoy it and appreciate it if they know what kind of movie it aims to be."

They are those characters in name only, aside from that they're just nods to the originals with none of the depth.Star Trek has had a more sophisticated audience, in general, than your average sci-fi action schlock. As fans, we've come to expect more from Trek in the form of rich character development, important social issues, myriad complex and plots and subplots.This movie shatters those expectations.We catch James T. Kirk et al in the middle of their erstwhile 5-year mission as they encounter an alien armada which rapidly decimates the Enterprise. So many unremarkable tropes variously reused, rehashed, reintroduced. So many unremarkable characters presented, showcased, finalized.The motion-sickness-inducing action inspires nothing but nausea. The shallow interplay between all characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, is bland and uninspired. This is action schlock.The action is decent. Following the captain and crew's moronic, illogical thought process, the destruction of the Enterprise is unsurprising and fantastically action-packed. The various combat and grunt-laden melee is visceral and satisfying. Beyond (hah) that, there's nothing.This new Scotty still has his oddly petite alien bromance. Uhura and Spock show they still care for one another. Kirk shows a desire to keep galloping around the galaxy in a starship rather than becoming a stodgy Vice Admiral stationed on Earth. Anton Yelchin gives his final performance before Daimler-Chrysler's poor engineering and quality control seal the actor's doom.This is NOT Star Trek. This is as much Star Trek as a human reincarnated in the holodeck is truly human. I honestly hope the upcoming series will redeem it, but that hope fades like the Enterprise in this lame duck effort."

The third is just boring.Fans will be pleased that 'Star Trek Beyond' now contains approximately 100% fewer lens flares (thanks to people hammering J.J. Abrams' obsession with them in 'Star Trek Into Darkness'). There's also a neat space battle near the beginning. Other than that, this is a completely dull and forgettable film.Once again, the people who created this film clearly have no idea what makes 'Star Trek' great. Staple 'Trek' concepts like philosophy, exploration, and moral dilemmas have once again been tossed in favor of frenetic action, overused CG, and forced humor. Although there's slightly more chemistry between the cast this time around, the oft cringe-worthy dialogue takes you out of the moment. Add to that, a weak villain with murky motivations, and it all forms a package that feels more like an overlong TV episode than a full-fledged movie.'Star Trek Beyond' is yet another cynical, lightweight 'Star Trek' movie that shelves any substantive content in favor of appealing to teenagers. And I couldn't possibly conclude this review without mentioning the ending; by far the most ""WTF?!"", preposterous, face- palming ending ever to a 'Star Trek' film.

" Farewell Leonard Nimoy...
",0.0,0.9556,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"This is the third movie in the ""new Star Trek"" saga, with new story and reinvented characters. If I can say that I really enjoyed the two previous films, this time I was a bit disappointed. The actors' work remains impeccable as well as the way the plot takes advantage of all the central characters, giving each one the right moments to shine instead of giving almost all focus to three/four characters, as happened in earlier movies. The way they interact and dialogue its also positive. So what made me so disappointed? Two things. The first is the powerful and obvious CGI, so evident that loses realism and credibility. It looks fantastic but is so clearly false that it doesn't impressed us. And worse than that: it dominates to the point the movie itself forgets the plot. That's the second thing that blew me away. The plot is something so basic and so poorly developed that it makes me wonder if it would have been better to remake one of the older movies. There are points in the film that are clearly unexplained, such as the nature of the bio-weapon that Krall sought so hard, or the reason he seems so unhuman for most of the time, to give only two examples.Either way, it's a movie that entertains the audience well and provides two hours of quality time. And its the first film made after the death of Leonard Nimoy, a very present absence during the film in that its abundantly mentioned and honored throughout the action, especially by young Spock (Zachary Quinto). No one, surely, doubts he deserved it."
" This Was Just Not Star Trek
",0.0,0.795,2017-04-20 00:00:00,2,"At its best (which it admittedly wasn't always) Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek was philosophical and thought-provoking and offered moral and ethical dilemmas for the crew of the Enterprise and the audience watching them to ponder. In fact, generally speaking, the more space battles and typical action appeared, the less interesting Star Trek was. So, what did J.J. Abrams do? He threw together a movie that was pretty much all space battles and typical action from start to finish - and the end result was a movie that simply wasn't Star Trek. I've been watching Star Trek since I was a kid in the early 70's. I KNOW Star Trek. This wasn't Star Trek. Anyone who watches this and says it's Star Trek doesn't know Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry would probably be embarrassed that his name was included at the beginning of the credits.The story is bad, chaotic and generally incomprehensible. It doesn't do anything that Star Trek did. There's none of the thought- provoking moral and philosophical issues I referred to. There's just action. Space battles and fights, on and on and on in a never ending and largely meaningless cacophony. There are plot holes galore - far too many to get into, but my favourite caused me to wonder how it is that Star Fleet has a starbase that the Enterprise can just pop into along the way when, as I understand it in the context of the rebooted movie series, the Enterprise is supposed to be busy exploring deep space - you know, ""where no one has gone before."" So how did this starbase get there? Obviously, somebody was there before the Enterprise got there!Admittedly, I may be being unfair. I may have missed something - the all-important missing link that pulled everything together and made this work. I could have missed that because, to be honest, this just lost me. It lost me within the first 30 minutes or so - most of which had been nothing more than a gigantic space battle. I tried to stay focused. I really did. But I turned this on expecting to see Star Trek. But I didn't find Star Trek. The names were right - but nothing else was. And seriously - did the Enterprise really need to be destroyed again. It's hard to keep track, but going back to the movies with the original cast, this seems to have been about the 79th time we've seen the Enterprise destroyed. And the title? I raised this with the previous instalment in the series. ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Into what darkness, I asked? That title made no sense. And now - ""Star Trek Beyond."" Beyond what? Are they just too lazy to come up with titles that actually say something about the story, or do they think that as long as the words ""Star Trek"" are in it enough people won't catch on to the fact that it isn't Star Trek and they'll want to see it anyway? At least I waited to see it on Netflix and didn't waste my money in the theatre.Was there anything I liked about this? Yeah. Sure. As always in the three reboot movies - the cast. Especially the three leads. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban all do a really good job of resurrecting Kirk, Spock and McCoy respectively (although Urban sometimes seems to try to force it a little bit in my opinion.) There were some attempts at incorporating a bit of humour, which even worked sometimes. (I thought the opening scenes were pretty funny.) I appreciated that the original theme music from Alexander Courage showed up in the closing credits. But that handful of things couldn't make up for a terrible story that simply wasn't Star Trek, and that had nothing to do with Gene Roddenberry's vision of what Star Trek could and should be.

He's become more mature, stiff upper lipped, someone you can imagine really being in command of something. And like the original Captain Kirk, he's learned how to be gracefully cocky.Unlike the previous two films, the logical, unemotional Mr Spock didn't have an emotional hissy-fit and brain anybody. In short, he was much like the real Spock.Like the majority of Star Trek films, the plot didn't make a staggering amount of sense. That's a pity. But still it was fun. I found it really strange that they hired a brilliant dramatic actor like Idris Elba, then completely covered his face with latex, and made him talk with an almost indecipherable accent.

As a Star Trek fan of old I think they should forget about making another one until they actually have a story that:a) Justifies 90 to 100 minutes - anything longer is just padding b) Is something we haven't been told 100 times before c) Has real tense moments and real ""I didn't expect that"" twists.This movie is dreadful, not sure why I have given it 2 stars ( I expect because I have seen even worse films )"
" For Anton
",0.0,0.9954,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"It probably doesn't exist, but I would love to find out there is a special club of Hollywood extras, made up entirely of faceless members of the Starship Enterprise who were sucked into space during an attack. This particular death is exclusive for the faceless, because it is not dignified enough for the 8 crew members we care about. Star Trek Beyond was written with reverence to the franchise, but may have stacked the deck against making enough characters matter. It begins on a familiar, but entertaining note. The Enterprise is hitting its 3rd year in deep space, doing the good work of The UFP (United Federation of Planets.) Kirk notes that he is coming up on a significant birthday, 1 year older than his father was when the Romulans made him a martyr. Despite Kirk's young age, he is considering taking a high-end desk job. Spock is doing his own form of Vulcan soul searching when the Enterprise docks at the Federation space station. Just when it seems we will be diving headlong into these characters' hearts and minds, duty calls and distracts. There were easily identifiable themes in the last two installments. In ""Star Trek"" it was lineage and destiny. In ""Into Darkness"" it was morality and friendship. With Beyond we believe the set-up will come full circle with a poetic remark on the crossroads' of these characters, but the spectacle becomes the theme. After a few minutes of docking at the beautifully expansive space station, The Enterprise is put through the ringer and the crew finds themselves held on an uncharted planet under the thumb of another monstrous villain. Krall (Idris Elba) is the leader of the hornets' nest of ships that dominate a remote nebula and veiled planet. The swarm of ships and carnage wrought by his innumerable army is the highlight of the aforementioned spectacle. Moving as an ever-morphing war unit, hundreds of ships attack like sentient thorns. Krall has an interesting look: a mix of between Worf and Jerry from Enemy Mine. His features are never consistent, as he uses an ancient technology on the planet to revitalize himself. I couldn't go into more specifics if I wanted to as the story hinges on the mayhem, not the details. Krall's planet is home to stranded races of aliens spanning generations. Jaylah is the local with a marvelous set of skills and technology. She has a great dynamic with Scotty and provides all the need-to-knows to get everyone into a final showdown. The showdown, of course, is the point. All the shortcomings in plot and character development fall quickly into hindsight when the epic space battle steals the show. Interestingly, the action and visuals are more Star Wars-like than ever. That's because J.J. Abrams isn't at the helm of this latest installment. Justin Lin (of Fast and Furious credit) directs Beyond with a heavier hand than the previous films. It doesn't extend into Michael Bay territory, but the cut- rate becomes pretty unforgiving during combat. When it comes to a space adventure, deep implications and well-established drama isn't what draws the crowd. However, all the spectacle doesn't amount to a great deal of memorable scenes. The resolution puts an obligatory bow atop the forgotten introspection at the beginning, and memories of the film play like a highlight reel instead of a story. Honestly, Beyond does not fall short of the other films. It carries the people we love into dazzling places, and I left with a smile. But after the tragic news of Leonard Nimoy and 27-year-old Anton Yelchin, I naturally wanted the best swan song for their talents. If anything is truly memorable about Star Trek Beyond, it is the words before the credits roll. ""In memory of Leonard Nimoy.""""For Anton."""

The story line is a typical Star Trek adversary of convenience with the good vs. bad becoming more black and white as the story moves along. The crew and the entire ship become victims of an elaborate trap set up by the captain of the USS Franklin. The captain and his ship manage to survive many lifetimes beyond normal. The Franklin's captain uses the life essence from other living things to continue to survive. A few inconsistencies develop with that premise. The old ship is kept hidden from its original captain by a crafty rebel who sets up holographic concealing imagery. The trapped surviving Enterprise crew use the old ship to chase after their villain whose goal is to destroy all humanity, even though the space city and humanity now comprise many different species. Somehow, the old captain never missed his ship, somehow the enemy ships use instruments readily understandable by humans, somehow the motorcycle is fully fuel-led after many many years. The list goes on. One supposes the purpose in choice of villain is to set polar opposites for what is humanity. Nevertheless, the villain is rather lame, predictable and winds up being defeated in the predictable ma-no e ma-no fight. Good comic book fun. Great CGI if you don't look too close."

Star Trek was all about smashing the boundaries and limitations of what science fiction should be, and it's what set the series far apart from other TV shows in the first place.I like ""Beyond"" because it does live up to the Star Trek mythos - just when you think you've got it pegged, it will throw you in a new direction. I've always appreciated the fact that Star Trek, as a series, challenged the norm. In fact, it created its own norm, that being nothing is at it seems and nothing can be taken for granted. Everything portrayed is not going to be to everyone's pleasure. That's a given, and in that sense, ""Beyond"" fits in with the general spirit that you should always expect the unexpected, at least that is how those with open minds should think anyway, and it's something I believe Roddenberry would expect."

Mainly because of plot oversights and just plain convenient timing or occurrences. That one can't help but find it a little bit annoying.While I love Star Trek. I'm not crazy about this one. And here is why. It's forgettable. And while I do praise it for trying to be original. It just lack something that makes me not want to ever watch it again. I saw it in the theatre and I also watched it on Netflix. And it really is a good movie just not the best.Like one of the main plots of the movie is this guy named Krall. Now Krall is the former captain of the USS Franklin and his name was Baltazar Edison. Now instead of having him have a part as a human they have the actor playing an alien throughout the whole movie. We don't discover this until near the end when Uhura discovers a video with him on it for half a second while they're looking for him. And really they should have had at least a 15-minute opening segment about the USS Franklin and its crew and what went on instead of this reveal later on that there's an old TV show Enterprise type Starship crashed on the planet. They addressed it a bit with some Captains Logs but the crashing of the ship and the discovery of the mining colony would have been great! Such a lost opportunity.It goes on and on and on and there's so many different parts to this movie that just don't make a lot of sense. It would have made an excellent TV episode but as a feature film it's just kind of like marathon of convenience that stops you into thinking about its lost opportunity with actor Idris Elba who played Krall/Capt.Edison. For that reason I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.Check my other reviews out if you liked this review.

The movie is another overblown CGI-fest and includes the same kinds of ridiculous plot-saving gadgetry that undermined the previous instalment (in that opus it was the portable transporter, in this one, the magical Kirk multiplier). Nothing kills science fiction movies more than instant technology that makes no sense, even in the context of the story, and serves only as a convenient Deus Ex Machina to rescue the protagonists in a photogenic manner or advance a stalled plot line. ST:B also continues the trend of millions of CGI dollars being spent on masses of swirling stuff, presumably to justify spending money on 3D tickets. Overall, the result is an incoherent, visually-uninteresting, dull movie. That it's directed by the guy who inflicted ""Fast and Furious"" movies on the public comes as no surprise – I almost gave up when Kirk found a motorcycle on a starship (and should have, as that would have saved me from watching the scenes where massive enemy fleet is destroyed by playing rock music at it) but, needless to say, regardless of the outcome of that massive space battle, the ultimate denouement necessitates a fist fight between Kirk and the head bad-guy (some generic Lizardo with an over-complicated backstory and a MacGuffin). Overall: an unworthy entry into the long-running saga and worth watching only with respect to its lineage - not in its own right. Too bad: the first entry into this iteration of the franchise was quite good and the second adequate - given this film's weaknesses, I don't hold out much hope for #4 (unless they get someone with some real imagination and vision to take the helm)."

I personally didn't see it coming, but it still fell a little flat with me because it just didn't carry much weight since the twist revolved around characters we just didn't get to know very well. I also felt like there was never any sense of dread or urgency in the film, despite what major events transpire during it. Overall, the storytelling felt a little lacklustre this time around.In terms of characterization, a few of the Enterprise crew members get some great moments to shine. McCoy and Scotty probably felt more significant in this movie than they did in the other two. Spock was surprisingly under-utilized, and some characters like Sulu and Uhura only had a few dialogue intensive scenes and were, other than that, practically invisible throughout the film. Kirk, of course, was the central character from start to finish. In terms of the evil aliens in the movie, they pretty much received zero actual development before the big twist late in the movie and weren't memorable at all. I feel like Idris Elba's talents were criminally wasted in the role of Krall. He's such an awesome actor, but as Krall? Well, he just didn't really get to do much other than run around looking intimidating for most of the movie. On the other end of the spectrum, the ""good"" alien of the movie was Jaylah, played by Sofia Boutella. Unlike Idris Elba, Sofia got lots of screen time and her Jaylah character got quite a bit of character development. While Krall fell kind of flat, Jaylah was probably the biggest highlight of the movie. She kicked ass, had a spunky tomboy attitude, and was exceptionally pretty looking to boot (her makeup job was very well done). I really enjoyed her interactions with Scotty and other members of the Enterprise crew, and I'd love to see her return in the next movie. Without revealing anything in the movie, suffice to say they do leave the door open for her return.Star Trek Beyond was a decently enjoyable movie and it did have several highlights, it's just that the villains were a little bland and the resolution employed to defeat the enemy forces felt a little hokey. Despite those shortcomings, it was a good movie. The main cast did great, Jaylah was a lot of fun, and the CGI was pretty good. If you enjoyed either of the first two movies, you should get some enjoyment out of the third instalment."

They stole the ""swarm"" from the movie ""Ender's Game"", and their villain Krall from ""Galaxy Quest"". The script was a ripoff of bits and pieces of many Star Trek TV episodes. There is nothing original going on in this movie. They even stole the cloaking device idea from the Romulan episodes, and to add insult to injury, they ripped off an Enterprise crash landing, almost frame for frame how it was done in Star Trek Generations.If all this wasn't bad enough, the acting was downright terrible. The beginning was so bad I thought Kirk was in the simulator playing a game. There are more clichés in this movie than aliens. Then to wrap things up, they decided it would be appropriate for the villain to become a suicide bomber.I was really hoping for something special in this installment, because it was co-written by Simon Pegg, and I'm a fan of his work. Note to Simon: ""Simon, stick to working on the warp drive, and leave the script writing to those that know what they're doing"".In summary: This movie is truly an embarrassment."

" Star Trek: Middle Age Crisis
",-0.6249,-0.5201,2017-03-09 00:00:00,5,"The ages-long rule says that whatever the case, the captain is the last man to abandon his ship. So when in the very opening of Star Trek Beyond we find out that James T. Kirk grew tired of the burden of his father's legacy pressing on his shoulders and wants to give up the conn for good, it's not the most promising start. As it turns out, Captain Kirk is far from the only person out here whose mind is occupied with the heavy thoughts of existential nature: this time the whole film feels like a reflection on one's duty, destiny and purpose. Pretty symbolic, considering that just recently we've lost two actors playing prominent Star Trek characters...Still, on the surface, there's nothing wrong with the mission of Enterprise this time. The ship and its crew still boldly go where no one's ever gone before. However, it seems that, by following the trend of exploring the deep space of character psychology, the film loses focus on the mission itself. The potentially catastrophic decisions are made with a childly easiness and without proper preparations, the captain decides to put the whole ship at risk because of some stranger's words. And the further we go, the sloppier it gets.My first guess is that, in the vastness of space, the filmmakers simply ran out of ideas. Star Trek used to be the (mostly lighthearted and optimistic) adventure kind of space movies, but since Into Darkness we've witnessed the arrival of Guardians of the Galaxy, the epitome of unseriousness, so I guess the writers didn't want the franchises to feel too similar, especially since they both have Zoe Saldana as a major character. So when the old screenwriters quit and Simon Pegg was summoned to make up for it, apparently he had to bite on more than he was able to chew.So, at the end of the day, Star Trek Beyond feels really half-processed. No true consistency, no impressive adversaries, a total McGuffin as the main threat, a lot of undercooked secondary characters and a plot spread so thinly across so many small details that it feels all over the place. Even the references to the old school, the trademark that made GotG cute and standing out, feel forced and ridiculous here. So, after the gripping intensity of the previous installments, Star Trek Beyond feels painfully slow, overloaded with non-necessities and, at times, plain dull. This is definitely not the legacy that the franchise deserves, so I really hope they do it justice the next time, or don't do anything at all."
" Not far away from being a bad movie

The action didn't work (Ok choreography + awful camera), and the movie is full of clichés and so predictable. The first movie was kind of an introduction and well made. The second one was exciting, interesting and so well made. This one felt just like another mission of the crew. But that is also what stops the movie from being a terrible one: It's the crew, nice actors, amazing chemistry between them and hilarious dialogue (But it is not as amazing as in the first both). Added to that, there are some nice costumes and sets. Still not a good movie, not far away from being a bad one."

But I've found that the ""new"" Star Trek universe is growing on me... Sure, it was surprising at first to see Chris Pine playing ""James T"", but he has grown more comfortable in the role--and has improved it by making it his own (instead of a clone of the iconic characterization that we got when William Shatner played the old swashbuckler). This was really apparent in Star Trek: Beyond* Spoiler Alert * Yes, there was a strong whiff of nostalgia in this film (stronger, in fact, than what we saw with ""into Darkness""). It was especially apparent in the focus on the grumpy but affectionate interplay between ""new Spock"" (Zachary Quinto) and ""Bones"" Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban). But there was innovation, too, in the weird backstory behind Captain Kirk's nemesis, Krall, and the introduction of a dynamic young actor, Sofia Boutella, in the role of Jaylah, a new character who could serve as a compelling and powerful female lead in future Star Trek productions* Stand Down Spoiler Alert *Kudos to Chris Pine (James T.

" Exactly The Movie You Would Expect (Action/Adventure) With The Director Change
",0.0,0.9966,2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"With JJ Abrams helming the first two movies in this series, the focus was clearly on characters and ideas (the things that Mr. Abrams does best). With Justin Lin assuming the director's chair this go-round, one could expect that the tone of this third installment would be quite a bit different. It most certainly is, and how much that bothers/excites you will determine where this one ranks on your overall enjoyment list.For a basic plot summary, ""Beyond"" sees the Enterprise and its crew sent on a diplomatic mission (of sorts) to resolve a feud. Upon arriving on the scene, the Enterprise is completely overwhelmed by a type of weapon they have never seen before. With the crew scattered to the winds (after abandoning ship), they must find each other if they have any hope of fighting back against this new enemy.First and foremost, ""Beyond"" is a high-octane action movie. Like I said, one couldn't expect anything different with Lin behind the camera. Indeed, the action sequences are thrilling, he uses the film's music as a perfect compliment, and the visuals are intense. Whereas the previous two films featured much more dialogue and contemplation, ""Beyond"" charges forward more often than not.Here's the thing, though: In order for Star Trek (of any incarnation) to really, really work, it must either A. Tell a really interesting story; or B. Focus almost exclusively on the characters and hope for incredible acting. ""Beyond"" misses the mark on both those accounts.There are snippets of interesting story/concepts in the movie, but they are not focused upon in favor of standard plot machinations and all those action scenes. The rigors of years in space, the concept of the Federation, and the bond between the crew members are all concepts that could have headlined the film, but instead they are kind of just thrown in at times to try to give the proceedings some gravitas. The old ""need to have some down time before the next action scene"" type of directing.In terms of acting, the individual performances are still great, but I found it an odd choice to have the main cast so split up for most of the film. So much is made in ""Beyond"" about teamwork and the closeness of the crew, yet there are precious few scenes where they actually all get to interact with each other.Now, if you are the type of movie-goer who enjoys an action-adventure romp above all else, ""Beyond"" will be much more to your liking. Personally, that isn't my favorite type of movie experience, so I really wish that it would have done a better job at picking a main plot focus and sticking too it. That isn't Lin's forte, however, so I can't say I'm all that surprised by how this one turned out.A final thought on ""Beyond"" is that I know it was rushed a bit to get into theaters corresponding with Star Trek's 50th anniversary. I wonder if perhaps that could explain why the writing felt a bit stunted and uninspiring. The bottom line, however, is that it really doesn't have that ""Bad Robot feel"" to it like other films that have come from the now-famous production company. It likely will do well enough to not kill off this line of films entirely, but the fourth adventure will have some significant proving to do that it can get back to great storytelling along with the action."

Instead of a summary, this is my impression of this mixed-up, misguided movie. I expected far more after a 3-year lull. As usual, Kirk hits on the super hot alien chick and some megalomaniac wants to blow up the Federation Universe. Yawn. I've seen it too many times before. So many questions and so few logical answers. How exactly did ""Krall"" morph from human to alien? How did he create ""The Swarm"" minions? Somewhat similar theme from ""The Undiscovered Country"" where there is no ""thrill"" without the conflict of war. Mankind and the Universe was not meant for full time peace. We thrive on conflict. Two many gun battles and hand-to-hand combat duels in this ""Space Western"". At least 2 endings. The special effects are magnificent and totally blew me away but some of the ""CGI action"" seems too similar to ""Lucy"" and it shouldn't be. I actually am starting to like Scotty's obnoxious alien sidekick and that's scary. It's nice to acknowledge that the ""tongue box"" is translating and everyone doesn't actually speak English. I love the line when the female alien quips about how easily Kirk fell for her ""sob story"", while he really didn't. Spock's father, Sarek, posing with the old Star Trek Crew from ""The Final Frontier"" is a funny inside joke. Not enough humor here overall and what's a ""Harley Cycle"" (with image repeaters) doing in outer space? Who does Spock love more, Uhura or James T. Kirk? (Quite disturbing.)

I found Into Darkness to be a disappointment, so I was very happy to see that Beyond is a return to form for the franchise.It's interesting to see the development of the characters. In 2009, we were watching young (as well as alternate) versions of the characters we knew. Now, a few years have passed, and the characterisation is closer to that of the original series, while still staying its own, in continuation of the two previous movies, and not just a copy-paste job. The acting was as strong as always, and everyone got a chance to shine, more so than in Into Darkness. And, as I wished, we got a new good female character to complement the presence of Uhura in an otherwise all-male main cast. I enjoyed the fact that this movie was, for most of its runtime, a planetary adventure, since the two other movies were more space(ship)- based. This way, it avoided a feeling of repetition. It also reminded me of the original series, where most episodes were set on an alien planet. The Enterprise doesn't have to feature in every part of the story.The general feel of the movie was better than both previous ones, but especially a big improvement from 2013's well-named Into Darkness. This one had colour and light (and not just blinding white light). Thankfully, black leather was almost nowhere to be seen. The only complaint I have is that the resolution was too rushed (and a bit ridiculous in parts, but that doesn't bother me too much). It's strange, because I generally complain that blockbuster movies' resolutions are too long.Well, in short, this was good and modern Star Trek, even if it wasn't perfect in every point, and I hope the next one will follow its lead."

As lame as that joke was, I put more thought into it than Lin must have with the directing of this film. This ""StarTrek"" film is an action, buddy comedy with a plot so nonsensical that I could not think of a way they made a film with so many plot holes who on the creative team could think it would make any sense. The action is fine, but this has as much to do with StarTrek as my ironing board. The story has the crew of the Enterprise travel to an unexplored nebula (sitting a 5 minute warp from a major star base) to save a stranded crew. Once there, they must stop Krull (Elba) and escape alive. Li tries to make everything bigger than it needs to be – the starbase is basically the good DeathStar, Krull's army is an unstoppable galaxy full of ships. It's simply boring and unbelievable. These are simply trimmings around the heart of this movie which is excuse after excuse to put the characters into set piece action sequences. The fighting is so over choreographed it is laughable. With the actors dodging punches that have not been thrown yet, and blocking the standard front kick, hook combo that no person would ever actually throw. It's all so overdone and tired. I did finish the film, and both Pegg and Urban have moments of comedy that had me giggling. Some of the special effects are also fine. The film continues the trend of the new franchise of being nothing but StarTrek in name. They might as well have called the characters Ben, Steve and Carol for all they have to do with the characters generations grew up loving. Lin and by extension J.J. Abrams are continuing to steal money from a fan base that deserves so much more. There are good StarTrek stories out there to tell, this is a franchise that deserves an honest reboot, not the crap that these people put out. The relative poor showing at the box office hopefully serves to put a bullet in this reboot. However with saying that, it won't be 5 years before we get another reboot, so maybe just keep rolling out the films J.J., and I will just ignore them."

To me, Yorktown resembles Nova Prime from Guardians of the Galaxy as well as some of the plot. The planet's forest scene reminded me of Avatar. But I was still engaged and entertained. The characters chemistry is still there and made this a a nice addition to the franchise. The look of the ship far surpasses Cpt. Kirk's Enterprise and I find that a little disappointing.

The way in which Krall's soldiers attack, as individual units linked to a swarm-like intelligence, although much grander in scale, is exactly like Michael Crichton's nano bots attacked in his 2002 techno-thriller ""Prey"". For Crichton Fans, this should be picked up quickly. I have always enjoyed reading Crichton's works. Although, unfortunately, few ever became good films, except for Jurassic Park. The Andromeda Strain, Rising Sun, Sphere and Timeline all had potential, but unfortunately lacked something somewhere between the screenwriter and the director. I have not read a single work which offered as many acknowledgments as Crichton. Each book's plot seemed more reality and less science fiction due to the premises which were often based on scientific fact and hypothesis. The fiction behind Jurassic Park, the cloning of an extinct animal, from it's petrified DNA remains, is now a working scenario. Fiction as it was written, now a scientific possibility. What's even scarier is that the future of self governed autonomous nano robots, as written about in ""Prey"", is coming to life in the way military drones in the air, on the ground and on the sea, are now beginning to operate.

You can really tell that this is a labour of love, and a lot of hard work and dedication from hundreds of people went into making it. I will say that I don't know why Hollywood reboots timeless classics, but these days it is the nature of the beast and I'm as incapable of influencing the decision making process of Hollywood executives as I ever was. We have to make do with what they decide to invest in, and occasionally I am absolutely delighted with the result. This is one of those times.This episode in the new franchise couldn't possibly be any more respectful, or a more natural evolution of the Original Series for this era of action, breath-taking special effects, and directors being held to ridiculously high standards by internet commenters. Those of us who simply enjoy a good, entertaining movie eagerly devour these spectacles, and leave the cinema satisfied as long we get a good storyline and likable characters too. This is a Star Trek movie that is at its core faithful to the atmosphere of the original series, but with a new direction, the power of modern technology, and an extremely high production standard. It's also, simply put; exciting and rather beautiful – and I couldn't be more pleased with the result.Kirk seems to be really growing into his final form, and Spock is starting to become the wise, and curt but affable cornerstone of the crew. Their shipmates have always been lucky to have these polar opposites fighting their corner in the face of infinite possibility, and the relationship that is forming between them as portrayed by these two young actors feels natural to me. Of course, with each progressive film in the series everything fits together that bit more comfortably. McCoy and Uhura are spot on too.I hope they keep this up; I spend the entire time grinning from ear to ear when I watch these films, especially this last one. As someone who LOVES Star Trek and always has I'd like to thank them all for their effort and dedication. I'm very much looking forward to the next instalment. This has been a lot of fun so far, keep going please!"
" Love it
",0.6369,0.9524,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Not sure what all the negativity is about. People seem to forget that Star Trek belonged to our previous generation, it needed a reboot for an new audience as well as past. I particularly like the references to previous Trek films from yesteryear, it's quite heart warming and a credit to the directors for thinking about it. I have thoroughly enjoyed all three including this one, it's another chapter and new characters, I love this cast, I love the stories and I guarantee the people moaning will go and watch the next one too. Stop comparing films to previous ones and just enjoy the film for what it is. Can't wait for the next one!"
" So now we have the token gay man. Why?
",0.0,-0.9623,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"The day Star Trek went from where no man has gone before to where loads of men have been.Killed the whole franchise for me. It's a shame because I actually liked the other movies before, but once Hollywood start injecting their political correctness nonsense into movies, they absolutely kill them off for me. Why mess with classics? This is Star Trek, they can do anything they want with it, there is an infinite universe and an untold amount of direction they can take this movie into, yet they do the lazy thing and plump for the usual nonsensical political statements. Why?"
" Star Trek Beyond Belief
",0.0,-0.9701,2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Did any of the writers actually watch the original t.v. show? I'm sure Simon Pegg must have as he's a fan. Star Trek was a great sci-fi adventure show with action, philosophy, drama and humour in equal measure. Guess which is the only one left in this movie? Yep action. The story, such as it is, features Kirk and company stranded on a planet when the Enterprise is destroyed (again - this scene has the nerve to rip off Star Trek Generations), and battling a villain who turns out to be a pre-Starfleet astronaut miffed at not being rescued by Earth, or something. He has an alien device thingy (red matter, anyone?) that keeps him alive by draining energy from people, or something.Some of the movie is watchable. But it's dumb. Sooooo dumb. Kirk's holographic motorcycle. Jesuspleaseus! This is beyond contempt. Pick the worst episode of Star Trek's original series, and I guarantee it never had anything as stupid as this in it.The cast? Chris Pine is humorously named, as he's as wooden as a pine tree! Give me the Shatner Ham any day! Zachary Quinto is getting rather fat in the face to be playing Spock, and he has another pointless romance sub-plot with Uhura. Just to give Uhura something to do. Only Karl Urban really shines (again). The rest of the cast aren't a patch on the original guys.Yet another 1000 special effects in search of a story. To be fair there is a little bit of story there, but not much.Good ol' JJ. Abe. After ruining Star Trek with his first two efforts he went on to ruin Star Wars. He's just producer here. But I'm still blaming him for ruining this too.If you can't do Star Trek properly just don't do it."
" ""Star Trek Beyond"" breaks the recent trend, goes the more classic simple and fun route
",0.5106,0.9963,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"The third mission of the U.S.S Enterprise in the rebooted alternative timeline version of the original ""Star Trek"" goes a little less boldly than its two predecessors, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The most notable change is that J.J. Abrams abandoned the captain's chair (for the other franchise starting with ""Star"") and handed duties to Justin Lin of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise. On scripting duties, Simon Pegg (who plays Scotty) and Doug Jung take over from Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Orci and Abrams still retain roles as producers, but that's a pretty significant creative shift, and ""Star Trek Beyond"" ends up with a much different look and feel.Tonally, 2009's ""Star Trek"" and also ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" were a bit darker, more dramatic and theme-driven blockbusters. This was in following with the mold of most franchise reboots at the time, which demanded more grit and maturity to elevate 'geeky' pop-culture source material for 21st century sensibilities. ""Beyond"" jettisons that notion into the vacuum of outer space.This should come as no surprise given Lin's proclivities with the ""Fast & Furious"" movies, which made their fortune on wowing audiences with outlandish action sequences and a familiar, lovable ensemble cast. The formula works for the ""Star Trek"" universe, because nothing seems too ridiculous in space, plus most audiences are familiar with the current crew of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin and John Cho. They've earned a chance to just have some fun.""Beyond"" is definitely fun, maybe bordering on mindless. It trades in the dramatic elements and character-building conflict of the last two films for a standalone outer space adventure. In that sense, it's more in the tradition of older ""Star Trek"" movies, which operated independently and felt like long ""Star Trek"" episodes.After a few years of status quo space exploration, the Enterprise crew docks in a snow globe-like starbase called Yorktown. There, the Federation picks up a distress signal from an alien who says her ship and crew are in danger on the far side of a treacherous nearby nebula. The Enterprise springs into action, but after they navigate to the other end of the nebula, they're viciously attacked by an alien force and stranded on the aliens' planet.This first major action set piece is a pretty exhilarating launching pad into the bulk of the story, and it comes not a moment too soon. In classic fashion, it splits the crew up into small groups, and the second act sees these teams trying to reunite and escape from the clutches of Krall (Idris Elba), who is looking for a weapon of mass destruction in the crew's possession. A bit of a ""Mission: Impossible"" factor (another Paramount franchise with Simon Pegg) sneaks in here as well, though the plot isn't quite as clever.The movie really hearkens back to ""Star Trek"" episodes and memorable films that take place off-ship and bring the crew to a strange new world where the audience gets to discover a new species right along with them. No knowledge of ""Trek"" lore required to enjoy this one, yet it's still immersive like any good sci-fi movie should be.This shift away from narrative continuity between films, diving into important themes and shooting for emotional catharsis is almost a relief. No film should shy away from that challenge, but there's something pleasant about the way ""Beyond"" lets go of those notions and opts for a classic form of geeky science fiction that's more about dazzling fun, witty banter and big action. By the same token, ""Beyond"" lowers the ""Star Trek"" franchise's ceiling. It's still possible to have an action-filled, funny sci-fi romp that challenges its characters and tackles universal ideas beyond merely that unity is better than divisiveness. Pegg and Jung's script is fun, but it's clear that they were encouraged to go simple. So the ""Star Trek"" franchise has traded ambition for a little more reliability. Three films in, that's not necessarily a bad swap. Ambitious blockbusters can fall flat, and some would argue ""Into Darkness"" already did. When you consider that ""Star Trek"" is not a series that's ever had neatly packaged trilogies or other overarching narrative structures, switching to a more episodic format helps maximize longevity. In other words, we got a slightly lesser ""Star Trek"" film that's better for the future of ""Star Trek.""~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Review for more"
