" A different beat
",0.0,0.4295,2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"By no means a comparison but watching this movie put me in mind of the likes of Repo Man directed by Alex Cox, Blue Velvet by David Lynch and Paris Texas by Wim Wenders. All movies I loved for being 'out there' in various degrees. Unconventional movies with dark humour and troubled characters. Rollins is both funny and menacing as a bingo playing immortal cannibal who isolates himself from others in an attempt to curb his gruesome bloodlust. Of course he's not successful but through no fault of his own. And so you find yourself sympathising with a monster with Azperger like social skills. It's all a bit odd and that's a good thing I think. Loads of people will hate it but hey, different drum and all that."
" A Twist Of Cain
",0.0,0.9109,2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a great vehicle for punk/alternative rock icon Henry Rollins. Rollins is perfect as antisocial loner Jack, who plays an immortal who has a craving/addiction to human flesh. Mixing extreme violence with black humor and a crazy premise makes for one unique and entertaining film. He Never Dies is hard to classify and is destined for cult like status. It's cool to see Rollins in big movies and television shows, but he really shines here as a leading man. I would like to see him do more stuff like this."
" Mindless entertaining action
",0.0,0.9305,2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, this is not horror, despite the title. Also isn't too extreme into the cannibalism aspect despite the summaries, especially compared to many other cannibal-themed films. It is entertaining, a bit of a thrill ride. Not thought-provoking at all, being fairly straightforward, but certainly a fun watch. The main character has an interesting premise and demeanor and it's entertaining to watch him fight. It's a bit of light fare. The main thing I disliked was the semi-abrupt slightly ambiguous ending. Secondly, some of the sound design is unnecessarily jarring, especially at the very start. But don't be dissuaded if you're looking for something light, action-filled, a bit bloody, yet still interesting and never boring."
" Criminally underrated
",0.0,0.1195,2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"It's a shame you don't get to see such well written and beautiful over the top movies.
Hollywood has become increasingly pseudointellectual and artsy in the last 10 years or so and you rarely get to see something that goes straight to the point and gives you what you didn't even know you were looking for.
It's not the best acting you'll see, but the script is so good.
I wouldn't give it a 10 if its rating wasn't already so low.
It's not formulaic, it doesn't take forever to explain itself and doesn't even find the need to do so. It is what it is and you'll either drop it in the first half hour or you'll be glued to the screen (me being the latter)."
" It's... a movie, I guess.

I suppose it's just entertaining enough to watch through, but not a lot more, you'll definitely find better stuff to watch."
" Different kind of movie but pretty good!
",0.857,0.9447,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,It seems kind of slow moving but somehow they keep it interesting. It really makes you think about good and evil and we need more movies that have an impact on us like this one. I'm not sure if this was drama or action or what but it was a pretty good story and definitely worth watching.
" A charming movie about a tortured immortal soul
",0.296,0.952,2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"Cain in the Old Testament was convicted to wander the earth as Jack of all trades and never die. This fate worse than death was portrayed in a Terminator meets The man from Earth movie in which a Bingo playing phlegmatic oddball meets his supposed-to-be-aborted sllut daughter, gets in some silly revenge-and-mafia subplot and has some divorcee waitress as ""love interest"". It is not really a horror film, but a quirky and covertly upbeat life affirmation story for the 50+ and indeed 500+ crowd out there. Namely, if you have a suitcase filled with millions in hard cash and some hand cannons along the way, plus are invincible, you may be cooler than you think, extra points for style and taking it slow and easy. It's not as bad as those screams from hell make it seem, even if the ever moralizing Lord from the good ole Bible is pestering you from time to time - and your coolness might grant you a bit of a reprieve as surely there are those more worthy of damnation, no matter how many livers of unkind dudes you gobbled up Hanibal Lector style (filmmaker is some sort of Canadian so unkindness is the ultimate crime, alas at one point of desperation, only kind people worthy of life are encountered). A silly, but harmless and partially mindless fun, just like the main actor and musician of (some) substance..."

Bible doesn't say really..Someone claimed he did but others disagree. Either way casting Henry ... oh they had a wicked sense of humor doing that. Makeup department on drugs lol. And the fact the movie doesn't really end.... Almost requires a sequel. The acting is rather well done, not exactly gory. I'd put it like a cross between Shoot Em Up and Taken with a mix of Constantine. And I think the latter would put him out of his misery.. Question is how long does the daughter live?

Re-Playable: 9/10 yeah I'm looking up the German blu ray right about now $5 plus $12 shipping isn't bad, could be a bit more since it's in euros"
" Enjoyable unorthodox film. But incomplete
",0.2382,-0.1311,2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,This film is quite unorthodox . It's not as simple as it seems. Main character is The definition of badass. I enjoyed that a lot.But Didn't like the ending. It was strange. Who is that guy ?! The guy that appeared four times or five times in the movie. Is he the original vampire or what. I wished this film would've justified more. And I feel like the film was cut short. I wished it was longer. to understand the main character more and to understand the other strange scenes.
" A Matter of Life and Life....
",0.0258,-0.9604,2020-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Whilst I'm in no rush to meet my maker - I cannot say I've ever really fancied immortality either. This film sort of supports that theory as Henry Rollins is ""Jack"" a dejected, lonely, immortal whose life revolves around booze, bingo, bed and blood (that he buys from a dodgy local hospital intern). Rollins' dead pan delivery works well for a while as his character slowly develops, but the story is really weak and the obvious advantages for him of immortality rather remove any sense of jeopardy for us, the audience, as he survives more and more attempts to eradicate him. At times there is some dark (ish) humour to temper the pretty relentless action/fantasy violence and some of the dialogue is actually quite expressive. Unfortunately, it's all just a bit too repetitive and after about an hour I was bored with it."
" Henry Rollins at his best
",0.6369,0.9299,2020-09-11 00:00:00,9,"Henry Rollins has always intrigued me. From rocker to speaking on highly intellectual topics on TED to playing believable characters on film. For a guy with a high IQ such as Henry Rollins he has always amazed me at how well he can relate to the common man on the street. You do not see that in many people with high IQs because the common man usually bores them after a 5 minute discussion.
Henry made this movie all his own with his acting ability and what a great movie and story line it is."
" Overrated, boring, bland
",-0.3182,0.394,2020-09-01 00:00:00,1,I get the movie. I understand the plot and it's goal. It's just presented very poorly and boring in my opinion.It's supposed to be a comedy/horror film but I neither felt any fear nor laughter.1/10.
" It could have been very good
",0.4927,-0.0989,2020-08-31 00:00:00,4,"This is one of those films with wasted potential. Henry Rollins is a very good choice. Also, Kate Greenhouse seems legitimate as a midfielder / love interest. And the whole concept of an ironic, scratchy antihero with a loooong dark past (quote ""I'm in the Bible if that means anything"") seems quite interesting.Unfortunately, everything else is a bit poor in terms of quality. Extremely poor lighting and cinematography - all shots look like a soap opera or film school freshman exercises, and each room is like a movie set. A very bad story - the ""secret"" that should drive the narrative is just stupid as the cause of the whole massacre and seems completely unrelated to the protagonist - so we don't care. Add to that the almost random editing that makes the film's rhythm mediocre at its best. All this could be blamed on a low budget, but unfortunately the director / writer is more responsible here. Almost all of these embarrassing scenes could be better directed, even on a tight budget. I will say more - the lack of money could HELP avoid staging clichés, which we usually manage to survive only when their ""seams"" are invisible. You can see almost every seam here. And it's impossible to stand it.However, I really appreciate the effort. Maybe someone someday - with a bigger budget and more experience - will remake this movie and save this concept from evil, amen."
" David Lynch meets Quentin Tarantino....!
",0.0,0.6249,2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,"A bit of horror, sly humour,good action scenes and a dash of mystery.
A gem of a movie - would happily see it again.
If you like a smart, enigmatic movie, this is the one."
" I agree, immortality would be boring....until someone disturbs your routine.
",-0.1027,-0.9626,2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"It is a dark comedy, with a touch of gore and indifference. Never really knew who Henry Rollins was until this film, but I liked his character.
A lot of people hate this movie because they can't relate to the main character (too young or too people oriented). His motivation: Just wants to interact as little as possible with people so he can endure eternity comfortably with minimal effort. If he is forced to interact with people he doesn't like......it awakens black-hearted emotions from deep within him that he would rather have forgotten.....but now that you stirred him up, you will get the worst from him. He's not interested in justice. He's interested in QUIET. So stop poking him.
What could have made this a better film would be a more coherent past for the main character, Jack. It seems they threw in some random religious origin theory items into the mix, not caring if they mix, but just to provoke.
""How old are you?""
""I don't know....but I'm in the bible, if that means anything.""
""WHAT?""
It provokes, but doesn't quite fit together to form a complete idea at the end. Not that I need things spelled out all the time for me, but a complete idea at the end of the film has some sense of satisfaction to it.
Oh, I had to suspend my disbelief about bullets not mushrooming upon impact with flesh to enjoy the film."
" Modern noir ala Henry Rollins.
",0.0,0.9755,2020-07-16 00:00:00,9,"This was good. Liked it more than I expected. But, then again, I always love me some Hank (H. Rollins). He played this really well. Can't imagine this role played by anyone else. (well, maybe Nicholas Cage?)
We watch a lot of indie and low-budget films, but this was really an unexpected dark gem. I don't want to spoil it, but if you like this kinda movie, it's definitely worth a watch.
Yeah, it's not perfect, but neither are you, so....."

" . SPOILER about who he is.
",0.0,-0.9069,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,This film has one of the most interesting premises I've ever encountered. The story follows cult acting legend (heat) Henry Rollins as Cain. The first son of Adam and Eve.He was banished to live alongside sinners for all of eternity as an immortal and cursed to feed on the blood of sinners. After he killed his brother abel out of jealousy. Some of this story was tweaked for the movie. His curse in the bible was just being immortal not the blood.Hes now tired depressed and bored living thousands of years and he wants nothing more than to die. At one point he yells at a mysterious man to let him die. It takes a bible story and creates something new and fresh. It's funny gory and thought provoking. Also Henry Rollins is great.
" Wow, this really surprised me in the best of ways!
",0.8881,0.9973,2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie has been in my to-watch list on Netflix for a long time, and tonight I decided it was time to finally check it out. I think before giving it a fair go, I had actually assumed subconsciously that it was not going to be the best, maybe because lately I haven't seen many good movies of its genres. But damn was my assumption wrong, I was just so pleased with this supernatural film! I loved it all the way through and will be definitely watching it again, it's going to be one of those films for me. I highly recommend checking it out yourself if you are interested in supernatural, drama, violence, and some dark comedy. Approach with caution if you are sensitive to any these themes, plus if you can't handle blood and a bit of a gore.Some highlights of the film to note, is the lead character Jack, played by an actor called Henry Rollins. So freaking bad ass! Worked so well and made the film in my opinion. I also love that the movie explores the backstory of Jack. I loved that this was included so, so much. Which leads to another highlight about this film, the story, everything, is quite unique. I think that's what made it all so alluring from start to finish. I was attentive the whole way through, and found it to be very thought-provoking, the story had me thinking after the film had finished. It is definitely one of the best films I have seen on Immortality. There are other things I really liked about this film as well, such as the atmosphere that was created, the choices of sound and music. Overall this film was awesome to me, and I hope you will enjoy it too!"
" slow out of camera action movie
",0.0,0.9369,2020-04-25 00:00:00,5,"This movie is 1h37 min. It appears they only had material for 25 minutes and filled the rest with some suspense and talking. Most action is, unfortunately, out of camera. The acting of the main character is comparable with a wooden door. Background information on the main character is very minimal. And last, but not least, the main character repels women, yet he seems to get the attraction of the most beautiful. Worth a look if you're interested, otherwise, you miss nothing."
" You have to check it out who is Cain (Jack) then you will understand this movie better.. Just google it.. It's interesting....
",0.0,-0.8189,2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,I found some interesting facts to share here so all of you will have better understanding of this movie. Cain (Jack) is actually 1st born son of Adam and Eve.. Due to his jealousy of God favours his brother Abel more.. He killed Abel.. In short so God punish him and mark him.. It's called Curse and Mark of Cain.. Wiki explains ''The mark of Cain is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him.'' That is why Jack (Cain) in this movie never dies...God wanted to punish him let him living like a fugitive for life and he cannot farm or harvest anything from the earth cos the earth will not produce for him anything due to curse of Abel's blood that soak the earth.. I guess that is why he won't die unless God allows him to die.. No wonder he always sleeps.. Cos he got too much time and he don't want to keep track of time... If you can live for eternity i think you will be really sick of keeping track of time and he try to sleep it out as much as he can... Hope this helps people who are confused with the movie...
" WTF

" Very under-rated suspense/horror story.
",0.0,-0.6417,2020-03-29 00:00:00,9,"The title tells you much of what you really need to follow the story of Jack, a man played by Henry Rollins to near perfection. As is common in really good suspense stories, you get barely what you need to know about Jack at first and the rest must be inferred by what he does. Jack says very little throughout the film but when he talks it is usually to show his annoyance with everyone and everything in creation. He is slow to anger but when he gets angry he unleashes literal hell - perhaps because Jack is clearly a man who is somewhere he doesn't want to be, and has been there for a long time.Change comes when his teenage daughter - whom he never knew existed - wants to come and see him. She forces Jack to reveal himself, if only just a little, then becomes part of something bigger and more sinister in a plot involving local crime figures in a scheme to get revenge. Along the way he befriends a waitress who has inexplicably become interested in him, whom he at first ignores but later uses for his own ends (with her horrified complicity). The movie has a pretty good plot twist, along with some gore to keep things interesting, so I won't talk about the reveal that is the payoff for following Jack's strange story.I don't know why this film is rated so low on IMDB since it has everything a low-budget indy flick should have: fairly good acting, a tight, taut story that continually makes you question everything, and an original and (more-or-less) upbeat ending. ""He never died"" has no expensive special effects or A-list actors and maybe that's what makes this film work the way it does. Everyone in the story is utterly believable, except possibly Jack himself; and that only because Jack's story is so extraordinary, putting the clues together in the audience's minds are what ultimately validate the character and give the film the impact it does."
" Passable
",0.0,0.7308,2020-03-05 00:00:00,5,"The movie delivers pretty solid action and a not half-bad premise. Where the issues come in are with the consistency and actual explanation of ideas. The movie never really explains the more underlying thoughts and actions of the film, and much of it is something you just have to accept, lest it eat away at you during the film.One such example is something right on the poster and the opening seconds of the movie: Jack's wings. In the movie, he doesn't have them. What he does have are scars where the wings should be. Does that matter to the movie? No. So why are the opening scene and the poster taking time to tell us, the viewing audience, as our only understanding of our protagonist that he has or had wings?That's more or less how the whole movie is. People do things for no real reason. Things happen for no real reason. It isn't bad, just unmotivated."

What i really did hate is that these mysteries are only explained half. I still had many questions that were not answered at the end of the movie.
There are (short) fighting scenes every few minutes, but the movie is still quite slow paced.If you are ok with a not fully explained end and are fine with watching B movies and like kinda mystery, you should give this one a chance."

In this movie, his character ""jack"" was as if Jason Priestly from ""Bloodless"" and Thornton from 'Sling Blade' came together and became Immortal.
In all, Henry Rollins IS a Renaissance Man, and he could read a phone book and make it a 4 star movie"

" pretty good
",0.7269,0.9417,2019-08-17 00:00:00,6,"Jack (Henry Rollins) is a world-weary supernatural being. He has endless cash, numerous enemies, and mysterious motives. He likes the diversion of church bingo and the waitress Cara at a local diner. There's a knock on his door. It's a young woman named Andrea and she runs away. She's his daughter who he doesn't know about.The concept is terrific. The story does need more clarity. The mystery of his existence is a major part of this movie but it does need some expositions. Andrea needs to be a little girl. It needs to be a Léon: The Professional situation. She needs to be younger and alone. She needs to be in danger to elevate the tension. She needs to have no safe harbor to intensify the story. While I really like the premise, the film is unable to take full advantage. On the plus side is Henry Rollins. He has an inner intensity that drives this movie. Jack and Cara do have a funny chemistry. It would be better to have them forced into an adventure together for the whole movie. This is pretty good for a small indie."

Every now and then, I take a chance on an obscure movie on Netflix and more often than not, I am disappointing. Every now and then, though, I find a diamond in the rough and this is one of them.I remember Henry Rollins as a musician, of course, but mostly from his role in ""Wrong Turn 2."" It was a crappy movie, yeah, but he was great in it. He was a modern day John Rambo. However, he gives the performance of a lifetime in ""He Never Died.""Jack, played by Rollins, is very monotone and very straight forward and actually pretty boring. He just wants to be by himself, play Bingo and lay down. He is blunt and completely honest.When you find out why he is like this, it makes perfect sense though. You'll watch Jack meet his daughter for the first time and interact with a small gang of idiots who keep trying to kill him. And then when you find out who Jack is, and you will know, it's one of the best twists in movie history. And Rollins delivery makes it work.If you enjoy comedy horror, watch this movie.

" Original take!
",0.3802,0.9337,2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,"In a way that only Henry Rollins could pull off, this modern take of the murderous son of Adam & Eve, Cain, Who is cursed to walk the Earth for eternity while enduring an unrelenting thirst for human blood has a uniqueness all his own. Rollins's deadpan approach to this character is absolutely perfect, quite funny and entertaining. Just when you think that he doesn't give a darn about anybody, except for those he feeds on, he displays a kind of angelic love for humans, in his daughter and ""would be"" girlfriend. Though absurd at times, the story has a pretty decent flow to it and we get a small glimpse into his ""suffering"" on Earth. I do wish that we were given more of a look into the background of Cain and his horrible tormented existence just a little further. There is one scene when she begins to ask if he is a ""Vampire"", to which he stifles her immediately. It isn't widely known, at least I wasn't aware, that Cain was also know as ""Vlad the Impaler"" or the original Prince Dracula. He also has some sort of ""moral code"" as in one scene when he is trying to quench his thirst, he purposely tries to pick fight or provoke his would be victims only to have a number people kindly apologize for running into him, and another man return his money clip he purposely tossed on the ground. The movie ends abruptly, but I was left wanting more and would think that this could set up as a Trilogy, or even a possible series that would prove quite entertaining. Not for the faint of heart, I was entertained throughout."

Unlike Miss Meadows (2014), Wild Target (2009), or Violet & Daisy (2011), the lead character is supernatural which means the role is more nuanced as possible creatures of the netherworld have an even more nasty connotation than sympathetic assassins. Henry Rollins own performance is on pair with Brad Pitt's role in Meet Joe Black who plays Death in a finely tuned persona and rivalling the haunting and very dark, sinister, yet sad performance of Scarlett Johansson in the creepy Under The Skin (2013). There are also suggestive elements from Constantine (2005) and Satan. The net result of the performance, script is an entertainingly funny, yet finely restrained gory movie about the soul or lack of one."
" Great and an unusual film
",0.6249,0.81,2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"I loved it. It's such an unusual film that it could be a cult type film in the future. It's a slow paced, low budget, low acting thriller with a sci-fi element to it that works brilliantly. It has an indi feel about it too. Henry Rollins looked in his element here due to his style as an actor. He says himself that he's not an actor, just a hard working guy that try's his hardest in everything he does. I read in another review that they're turning this in to a series, if so, that would be brilliant but only if Henry Rollins played the lead role again."

Every now and then he meets the hospital intern Jeremy (Booboo Stewart) to buy blood; he goes to the nearby diner where he is attended by the waitress Cara (Kate Greenhouse) that likes him; and he plays bingo in the local church. Out of the blue, he receives a phone call from his former girlfriend that asks him to meet their daughter Andrea (Jordan Todosey) in a bar. He brings Andrea home, breaking his routine and turning his life upside-down. When she is abducted by a local mafia, Jack is forced to unleash his latent violence.""He Never Died"" is a strange movie that has potential of cult-movie. The dark humor is excellent and Henry Rollins has top-notch performance in the role of a weird cannibal creature that never dies. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ele Nunca Morre"" (""He Never Dies"")"

He did really well in this role, and watching his deadpan character interact with the world was enjoyable. Jordan Todosey was great in her role as well. The story could have been much better though. It's a muddled mess until the final act, and even then it's still not exactly clear why things happened the way they did. The movie is slow and plodding and there were a couples of times where I considered checking out."
" Wasted opportunities
",-0.1531,-0.8798,2018-09-21 00:00:00,5,"Such a good idea but such a bad execution, the whole movie has no story and no plot, only a showcase of inception of a movie idea, yet nothing, literally nothing at all built around and upon it, even the main character himself, his character is all over the place, one time he's dumb as fk, socially awkward, cares about nothing, and another time pbbly an IQ of an average person and cared about something, even talkative and all that, then in the end, he's suddenly this demi god, spewing essays and leaving one liners. A man that had experienced that much would have been a freaking saint wiser and more towards a character like gandalf, rather than this mess. While the movie had a really intriguing idea, theres barely any plot or story in it, such a waste of material."
" You Kick Ass!
",-0.5848,0.9391,2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"This is my first movie review ever posted on IMDB since its inception, and I start now just because of this movie.
An outstanding job with photography, ambient sound, and music, all put together in an amazing show, Excellent!
I am amazed that I got into it so much, but I couldn't let go. 
Unfortunately, it got a little too cheesy for a few minutes, but on the upside, it didn't last so long, so it didn't detract too much.
It's a bit funny at first, kind of an Jerk hole type of thing going on from the start, but I found it wonderful that the people around him shut the hell up and left him alone once they got what they wanted. On the flip side, those who only wanted to know him stuck around, and had a bad day for it.
I know I'm being very vague plot wise, but damn...just check it out. Its not about the plot..or is it?
I have only watched it once, but was amazed, I think this is a movie I'll watch a few more times and try to contemplate things...neat! I like it!
I'm giving this show a full 10 stars, because nothing I've watched has gave me full pause to do so before."

Dialogs are just perfect. Funny and brutally sarcastic. Maybe holywHoll should start picking up people right from the street for acting main roles, just like Kusturitsa did in his ""Black cat, White cat"".I won't say much more. Go watch it on Netflix. You won't regret."
" A film about nothing
",0.0,0.9689,2018-06-02 00:00:00,4,"This could've been a fun sarcastic little short.Instead it's a pretty long and not particulary interesting movie. Humor is hits and misses, sometimes it almost works. I guess it works better if you are a fan of Supernatural-like shows.While watching I came up with lots of interesting ideas about the mystery behind the main character. But it turned out to be absolutely random and not connected to anything. You can replace his background story with any random background story because there isn't really any connection, just a set of random scenes edited by a guy with ADHD (all dialogue is edited with like 1,5 sec cuts).Random scenes happen, some more random scenes happen, we are shown that he cannot die. I guess with a title like this you are expected to be surprised. Then comes the random reveal and the movie just ends. Nothing really happened so I can't even discuss anything in detail. You can't spoil this movie either.I love trash movies, but this isn't even good trash. I was surprised to see such high ratings, I guess this has a cult following, but I really can't figure out why."
" One day, you'll see the man I was talking to
",0.0,0.9646,2018-04-15 00:00:00,9,"'He Never Died' is quirky and serious at the same time. This film has much more depth than one can expect from such genre (horror-comedy). Henry Rollins gives a performance of a lifetime as a loner Jack, who doesn't want anything more than left alone. He is immortal who has roamed the Earth since the beginning of times. Even he himself doesn't know how old he is (he knows that he is mentioned in the Bible). Having witnessed centuries of petty side of human existence, it is no surprise that such a creature have developed such detachment from society. His mono-syllabic answers and responses are usually hilarious. The screenplay is well written with plenty of sly humor and twists. Much is said with little words and explanations. Character Jack is well developed, and not only - being immortal, he is actually very relatable and realistic. Supporting characters are also interesting, and are never demoted to just a daughter, love interest or gangster. Gory, funny and unpredictable ride that is actually much more than simple horror comedy."

" Prepare for a quirky, odd, dead pan treat!
",-0.636,0.9741,2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Late at night, looking for something to watch and came across this because I like Henry Rollins. 10 minutes into the movie and I am wondering if this is the worst movie ever. Then as it continues, I realize that this is not a bad movie, this is a movie made exactly like it was intended. A little bit campy, defiantly different, dry humor, and wonderful. If you prepare yourself before watching it, I think it could earn 10/10. This movie was a hidden gem that I thoroughly enjoyed once I realized the directors vision. If you are wanting a JJ Abrams light show, this is not for you. If you want a brilliant movie with perfect amounts of quirkiness and even a few one-liners (a vagina is a coupon for alcohol), then this is the movie for you."
" Do NOT Pass This One Up!

And gawd-awful movies with 1 or 2 star viewer reviews are listed as 5 star flicks. What does this prove? Ignore Netflix advice and seek info elsewhere before deciding to watch a film. This movie was absolutely brilliant IMHO. It has it all...comedy, romance, peril, violence, Booboo Stewart (eye candy who's screen time was only a scant few minutes, even though he got second billing), and last but not least, Henry Rollins. I vaguely knew of him, but he really shines in this roll. I would have given this 10 stars, but the ending was a slight let-down, perhaps because I didn't want it to end. Do yourself a favor, and watch this black comedy/horror film instead of one of the 5 star duds Netflix offers."
" Much more than I expected
",0.0,0.9881,2018-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this perspective of an immortal human. Having said that, I would have liked it to be even better - because there were a few letdowns that other people don't seem to be particularly bothered about. One of these was the weird vampirism factor. A bit contrived for my liking - yet Henry Rollins did portray it quite well, given the script.Of course, like most others, I was extremely impressed by the way that a person who is as old as mankind would not have much to say in casual communication. This must be the most thought-provoking theme of the entire story. The minimalist lifestyle is obviously appealing too and one can immediately imagine that since there is time to try everything out, several times, that ultimately every experience is worth having, regardless of how unappealing it may seem to mere mortals.As others have mentioned, there remains enormous scope for a series of this character - but it would require very careful writing. It takes exceptional effort to create an interesting and credible narrative about an exceptional person. Too often, even a team of writers is just not imaginative enough to come up with ideas for a genius, an immortal, a super hero or any other character that is greater than them collectively, in some way."

He doesn't say much and presents a tough guy ""Dirty Harry"" demeanor. He eats at the same diner everyday where Cara (Kate Greenhouse) has taken a shine to him. He discovers he has a daughter, but takes little interest in her (Jordan Todosey). Jack's identity is revealed 70 minutes into the feature.This is a noir type of film. It was original and done well. Jack's dry responses create a dark humor making the film enjoyable to watch.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Plenty of blood and violence."

" Blood, Bullets, Bingo.
",0.0,0.9791,2017-10-23 00:00:00,7,"'He Never Died' is probably one of the most refreshing horror comedies in recent years, although it is not pure horror comedy, but rather an action film with roots in scares and gore. The humor is so subtle and it can take a while to realize you're watching a comedy. The blood and guts is not blatantly in your face. And the main attraction - Henry Rollins as cannibalistic demon Jack. No matter how big fan you might be of the man, but you have to admit Rollins is not the greatest actor around. But here, he gives performance of his lifetime, real force of nature.'He Never Died' has its flaws that some are directly connected with low budget and some comes from little bit underdeveloped script. Side characters are quite one dimensional, but thanks to nice acting jobs they are not thoroughly paper thin.'He Never Died' is supernatural revenge action film that doesn't take itself seriously, but manages to be serious enough to affect the viewer emotionally. The humor is not in your face and laugh out loud moments, but rather relies on relationships between characters and subtle reactions. Nice and pleasantly different film, and it will definitely rise into cult classic status.Henry Rollins is one cool and badass dude, but in the future he will be remembered not only as a singer of Black Flag, but also the star in 'He Never Died'."
" Don't really know why it's so great
",0.7384,0.9633,2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,"I have to say that I really, for my life, don't know why this movie are good. I would really put it in the top 3 supernatural movies I've ever seen, if not the top one. The thing is it shouldn't be close to my top 10. It is slow paced, there isn't any great Hollywood effects. You get some of the backstory but really not that much. But on some way it creep up on you and take hold. The acting and casting are superb and as I said no expensive hollywood effects, that combined with the soundtrack make the movie an absolute diamond. When it ends all I could think was, I want more. But in all honesty I think that no matter how they would make a prequel or sequel it would just suck.So if you like movies of the supernatural kind and haven't seen the film I really think you should give it a try."
" A Masterpiece of on-the-sideline-movies
",0.6249,0.6725,2017-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely stunned by this movie that did not see the wide release it should have. The production value is a little low, as one can tell by the small cast, the shooting locations and the relatively unknown studio and producer. And that's about the only bad thing about this movie. Henry Rolling carries the whole movie with a deadpan version of his character, every conversation with him is a new treat. The supporting characters were well done, not overly sensational but it doesn't matter because Jack is back on the screen and scowling at someone. Even a simple ""okay"" delivered by Rollins is a reason to turn this movie on (it is on Netflix right now if I'm not mistaken). Honestly, invest the 90 minutes it takes for this movie to wrap up, and you'll wish the promised sequel or TV series will actually take off."
" Not a horror fan
",0.2584,-0.9659,2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"I came across this film by accident, as a friend was watching it. Not being a horror fan, of course I am not going to like this film. But while horror fans, may rate this film according to what they like or dislike in horror, I am going to use this opportunity to rant a little about why most horror sucks. When I watch movies, I like story, character, excitement, beauty, inspiration, insight, and of course most horror has none of this. The Omen & The Exorcist being such landmark movies, get my agreement, but generally I find horror to be such a negative, scary, yucky experience. Why do people put themselves through this process? If they have little reaction to fear, then the film does not affect them I guess, and if they do, then this kind of film affects their mental & physical well-being. So it is for some like an addiction that they keep feeding, harming themselves, rather than turning it off. I do like suspense and exciting stuff like Bourne or Alien, but all this focus on dangerous people hurting each other, zombie movies relentlessly being created and all this satanic obsession, seems to me, to be putting people in situations to not trust, to see a threat at every corner, and to threaten ourselves with all kinds of creepy forces beyond our control. Many people are into all that, but I see a lot of it as popular culture, with an addictive nature, and the outcome of so much fear based religion. This film is the kind that I watch in 10 minutes. Once I understood that the goal was to create violent grotesque situations, I decide to skip through it in 2-5 minute sections just to see if anything changes. Of course, it was very formulaic. So my review is not about this film specifically, but more about these violent negative films that seem to be another reflection of a world still teeming with many who have a fear- attraction to violence & harm, just like many highlights on the news! If you want your life to be more uplifting, skip on the horror, and free up your life for more enjoyable beautiful focuses. And if you like freaking yourself out, then please enjoy :-)"

Jeremy is, meh. The two thugs are, what they are. Cara is, pretty, and OK. The landlord is perhaps my second favorite character, and I'm not even sure she's meant to be of any consequence.The directing is choppy, and I can't even remember the composition.

Yeah, Henry Rollins is pretty good, but, it's not enough for a rating over 6, but, to each their own I guess.3.5/10."
" Very good, but hard to categorize
",0.0261,-0.3607,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"A middle-aged man lives a lonely life. And it is pretty much the most boring one possible. Every day he goes to a diner where he orders a vegetarian meal using as few words as possible. He watches a lot of television and sleeps a lot. Once or twice a week he might go and play bingo in the local church but only using two cards because he doesn't want to keep track of more. But, his dreams are riddled with screams and moans of agony, his past life still haunting him, and every now and then he buys a mysterious package from a hospital intern. Our story starts as he meets an unexpected figure connected with his past, just as a few tough guys come knocking on his door wanting to know the whereabouts of his most recent dealer slash package deliverer.It's also possible that I'm going to say too much during this review. It really is a film worth seeing knowing as little as possible. Trust me when I say it's good and go see it. Because it is one of the most intense and brutal films I've seen in recent years. The story behind this lone man unfolds slowly, and it's not at all what you'd expect. It's pretty hard to define what this film is. It's a genre film, but not in a way that's going to bother anyone. It's a crime film, but not in the usual sense. It's even comedic, mostly due to Henry Rollins' deadpan delivery in the midst of all the brutality. It's themes are sin, the burden of the past, even family obligations in a certain sense. It's biblical. Perhaps even vampiric, but only on a thematic level.Henry Rollin' performance keeps it all together. Some would probably say that the film is so over the top that it's comedy, but I don't really get that from this film. It has good laughs in it, but the humour is rather dark and comes from Rollins' unflappable demeanour. The film is filled with brutal imagery, but it is not too gory for most viewers. It doesn't feast on the gore, like some slasher films.All in all, definitely a film that surprised me with its quality."
