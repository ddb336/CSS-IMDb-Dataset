" One of the Best Thrillers Recently Released
",0.6486,0.9442,2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"In Washington D. C., the lobbyist Madeline Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) decides to move to a minor agency owned Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt (Mark Strong) as a challenge in her successful career. While facing the Powers That Be, she has to prove her competency paying a high-cost.""Miss Sloane"" is one of the best thrillers recently released by the Cinema Industry. The powerful story and screenplay has complex dialogs and the magnificent Jessica Chastain in the lead role. This is the type of film that deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Armas na Mesa"" (""Weapons on the Table"")"
" A Political Dream
",0.25,0.9479,2021-03-24 00:00:00,6,"(Written in 2016): Shakespeare in Love director John Madden's political drama-thriller Miss Sloane is a film likely to distract those with the political issues it presents, and given its tendency to fall too much into the debate rather than the higher target it argues against (lobbying), the success or failure of it will be hinged on the partisan perspective of the viewer. Starring Jessica Chastain in her coldest role to date, Miss Sloane follows Elizabeth Sloane, a manipulative, stone-faced Washington D.C. lobbyist. Working for a major lobbying firm, Sloane is all about the art of the win and purposefully uses anticipatory strategy to either advance or defeat political action on Capitol Hill. Presented with the opportunity to defeat a gun control bill with a universal background check prevision, Sloane decides against the opportunity and chooses to leave her firm to work for their opposition in support of the gun control bill.The film weaves back and forth between Sloane's private emotional and professional ethical deficiencies, creating a complex though overly-shelled character reminiscent of the highly popular female anti-heroes such as Olivia Pope (from TV's Scandal) or Annalise Keating (from TV's How to Get Away with Murder) minus the soap opera-esque Harry Houdini evasions of legal culpability. However, the film leaves itself vulnerable to the partisan political bickering as it seems more invested in the gun control debate than it is the ethical quagmire that is lobbying and its gross influence over the broken American political system that have reduced elections to theater and issues to personalities. While it certainly plays up the mechanics of this reality, it does more with cynical, matter-of-fact quips and one-liners while it devotes the majority of its emotional content to the gun issues as personified by the character of Esme Manucharian (played convincingly by Gugu Mbatha-Raw).In a political climate of rampant leftist defeat and barely resonating sentiment for its core issues, Miss Sloane may read triumphant in its Hollywood fantasy but in reality, it comes off more as another opportunity to fall into a circular debate in which the left-wing position leaves with nothing but its anger. With such a tilt toward the political issue instead of the political system, it diverts its attention from its core issue (much like the film's marketing campaign which likely poisoned its commercial prospects). Instead, the film feels more like the saccharine, left-wing pipe dream of 2000's The Contender meets the ""fixer"" drama of Michael Clayton.For a left-wing individual, it might prove a fruitful excursion in the era of ""Trumpism"" even with its obvious Usual Suspects, M. Night Shyamalan twist ending that seems like the kind of ""Hail Mary"" divine intervention the left desperately wants this Christmas (you know, to wake up realizing 2016 was all a dream). However, for those averse to the political implications of the issues it explores, it will simply be a dud, which is unfortunate given the strength of many aspects of its screenplay and characters, and the importance of its main subject. Jessica Chastain's performance certainly cements itself to the cream of her acting crop alongside The Help, Zero Dark Thirty and A Most Violent Year, and is likely the onlu thing to transcend the partisan reaction and criticism of the film. If anything deserves that, it would be Chastain's performance."
" powerhouse performance by Jessica Chastain
",0.0,0.9765,2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,"A very highly entertaining movie. Jessica Chastain is superb as the hard, tough-as-nails lobbyist who has her inner demons to conquer.
The story may be a tad over the top but that doesn't negate from it's appeal. Quite simply, it is great cinema. The negative reviews are silly and seem to by by people who either didn't watch the film completely or got their feathers ruffled by some of the its content. If you love a good film, do yourself a favour and enjoy this powerhouse performance by Ms Chastain."

" Real People Don't Talk Like This
",-0.2755,0.8098,2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"The plot line was quite engaging, but the dialogue sounded like scripted sound bites. The characters are primarily stereotypes, thus making the entire production feel like a cartoon."
" I'm an actual liberal and I found it mind meltingly bad.
",-0.5423,0.86,2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Some claim that this movie is propaganda and it is but it is *much* worse than that because it is bad propaganda which is the kind that converts no one.If anyone thought that The West Wing was a liberal smugfest then you wouldn't want to see this. Alternatively if you really enjoyed The West Wing then this movie is probably for you but here are my criticisms of it.Jessica Chastain's character is supposed to be good at her job yet in every single scene and every line of dialogue she comes across as a student union yahoo. It isn't just the hard right who have their collection of braying idiots and here is a prime example.This whole movie is like watching an alternative version of reality where a person isn't immediately fired for insulting a client and I don't just mean doing so in a Don Draper sort of way but by literally laughing in their faces and then offering to work with them. I mean, really?The story line is silly, the cast are all idiots and nothing is believable.This movie is smug, pretentious and utterly unbelievable on every level."

" Molly's Game brought me here.
",0.0,0.9231,2020-12-15 00:00:00,9,"Jessica Chastain is incredible. Her acting is out of this world. Movie was directed with precision. Besides Jessica herself, the script is the best part. If you liked Molly's Game, you'll love this as well."
" Drama, intrigue and at times hard to follow...( spoiler )
",-0.1027,0.6977,2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit I am a sucker for witty, smart dialogue drama. This movie had all the making of a few good men, courtroom suspense and chess pieces anyone would want to play. I had only wish it can simplify the dialogue to more everyday mans vocabulary. Even with subtitles it was hard to follow with all the terminology. But in the end good movie even though I didn't leave wanting to be anti or for gun control. Oh and why the escort lied in court? Because great exposure for more client and keeping it professional- client confidential or else he would be out of a job"
" Thrilling, gripping and mind-blowing!
",0.5255,0.9938,2020-12-11 00:00:00,10,"I don't know how such a good movie is so underrated. Maybe because of the political statement that this gives. But from filmmaking point-of-view, this is definitely a good film. Unlike high-octane thrillers with so much action happening, this one is a very brainy and cerebral film where everything happens by planning, plotting and manipulating. This is based on a very different profession and you should watch yourself to understand this profession. If you've watched Zero Dark Thirty, you know how impactful Jessica Chastain is. Here, she is just flawless. Playing the titular character who's so eccentric and sociopathic just like Sherlock Holmes, she was amazing. About the story, it's based on US political and legal system so in the beginning it'll be a little difficult to understand but after 20-30 minutes into the film, we understand what's it all about and that's what I like about such films. Being here in India, we can learn so much about their system through such films. And the climax here is just mind-blowing. This is now one of my favourite climaxes, really.
If you like such films where there's so much planning and manipulation, you definitely should check this one out.
Rating : 10/10
(For the love of Jessica Chastain and Mark Strong being so good and the wonderful time I had watching this)"
" Anti-gun fairytale posing as a political thriller
",0.1027,-0.8847,2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"No, the anti-gun sentiment isn't just a sub-plot, it's the entire purpose of the film.
Every character on the anti-gun side is good, noble, motivated by higher things than money.
Every character on the pro-gun side is immoral, self-serving and greedy.
The arguments for more gun-control where splashed liberally (pun intended) around throughout the film, but their opponents had no good arguments, their only recourse was to threaten senators with damage to their careers in order to persuade them to vote for the Heaton-Harris bill.
I live in the gun-free UK and I could put a better pro-gun case than anyone in this film.As for the scenes showing us politicians in the pockets of the NRA. From the evidence of the last four years, using legal process to fight political battles, strong-arming politicians with threats or straight-up bribing them, are much more the Democrats' style.The only good pro-gun argument voiced in the film was right at the start when Sanford talked about putting them in the hands of women and someone said ""God made men & women, and Samuel Colt made them equal"". But if you were tempted to give that serious consideration you were quickly told otherwise by Chastain laughing loudly and dismissing Sanford as a clueless old man. From that point I knew what side Madden and Perera were on and we were not going to get an interesting clash of ideas on the rights and wrongs of guns in the USA.
And I was right.Two hours of propaganda dressed up in a hole-riddled plot; peopled by characters less believable than the cast of Shrek."
" Complete crap
",-0.3818,-0.3818,2020-12-06 00:00:00,4,"This is hollywood trying to convince unknowing liberals that buying a gun is like buying a pizza. You can't buy a gun without an extensive background check. Especially in california. They have a 10 day ""cooling off "" period. If you have a ccw (concealed carry permit ) you can buy a gun in nevada within 15 minutes. To get that ccw they do a federal background check on you. Other than the lies they're telling you this is a good fictional movie."

" Mesmerising
",0.0,0.6703,2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"So often I find myself dozing off after a few minutes of watching the mindless drivel that studios puke out with monotonous regularity these days. This film made me sit up and pay attention right from the start.No doubt much of the attraction is down to Chastain, who captivates and mesmerises from the moment she appears. But also it's down to a clever and unpredictable plot that does just enough to keep your brain interested, without being so complex that you just can't be bothered.I love this film and Chastain's performance. Proof that a decent script and personnel can entertain just as well as being bombarded with CGI and loud music."
" Where is entertainment ?
",0.4215,-0.1901,2020-09-10 00:00:00,4,"Character of Miss Slone is seems over smart and overconfident. Quick answer to any question style of her dumb down in trial court. At least I have not sympathy to her, why? i don't' know. May be character developing is not according as my view. If I leave this aside then story? Entertainment ? nothing half a movie seems boring conversation of high profile politics, brokers and their lobbyists I nothing found in the name of entertainment."
" Outstanding satire on political corruption
",0.6124,0.9548,2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,"Probably the most fascinating aspect of this story is that it was centered around two of the most corrupt institutions in America. The gun lobby and the US Senate. For the US Senate to question a lobbyist over ethics is a mind boggling conceit. We all know lobbyists own the senate and congress. So does the NRA.
ThIs a very good movie. Excellent writing. Fantastic performances by Jessica Chastain and Mark Strong. And several of the other actors. Highly recommended as a political thriller and an expose of the DC sewer."
" In depth look at our awful gun allowances .
",-0.6597,0.8599,2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,Jessica Chastain was superb ! I never considered that the movie didn't do so well at the box office because it told a story about challenging our too lenient gun laws . But it's a good point . And a sad one as well . I'd give up my 2nd amendment right in a heartbeat to save anyone from an AK47 or any gun for that matter .

I didn't walk into the viewing of this movie with any preconceptions other than potentially being entertained. I'm just not in the mood for what feels like another ""Powerful woman goes up against powerful adversarial men to show them SHE rules the world"". If that's the kind of movie you're looking for, I'm sure it's been done better elsewhere. There's nothing appealing to me in this movie and everything feels forced and plastic. No personality or charm."
" One of the best stories I have seen.
",0.6369,0.9294,2020-03-07 00:00:00,10,This movie truly is one of the best written screenplays. Although not my favourite movie but the story is one of the best written. I would be eagerly waiting for another movie by the writer.

All acting in the movie was top notch, and it was so satisfying to see Miss Sloane to stick it to the pigs at the very end, I loved it! More Miss Sloane movies please! I will be watching the movie again, and there are not many that I watch more than once. Thoughts and prayers for the USA, it is a very sick country these days, but there is hope with Miss Sloane on our side."
" Satisfying And Morally Complex
",0.4588,0.7269,2020-02-08 00:00:00,7,"A morally complex story about gun control lobbying and legislation in Washington, D.C.; Jessica Chastain leads a strong cast, in agreeable scenery-chewing form, a character as compromised as everyone else around her.Despite the complexities, however, there is much that is Sorkinesque in the plot beats, the dialogue and tendency towards grandstanding; a grandstanding that is understandable in the realm of gun control given how ineffective subtlety seems to be. Unfortunately the film suffers from a final few minutes that strain credulity, but overall the film is both stimulating and entertaining."
" Interesting and intense
",0.4588,0.875,2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,Great movie on an important issue of lobbying in politics with strong acting and surprising ending.
" Smart person's movie. NOT really about the gun lobby.
",0.0352,0.8019,2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Miss Sloan is like an IQ test. If you like smart movies about effective people and their methodology, you'll like it. If you are tired and just looking for a bit of fluff before bedtime,
this isn't really it. Also, if you are Pro-gun for Just Anyone and you aren't strong enough to listen to a dissenting viewpoint, jog on. I hear Mary Poppins is cute.The real story is about reaching a goal and how far some are ready to go.Also note - Female lead, no Oscar nomination.I gave a nine star rating, it would have been 10 if there'd been a female director. I'm not a Feminist except where the paycheck is concerned.OUTSTANDING movie."
" Don't watch alone!

I'd never heard of the film and so I made the mistake of watching this on a bit of a whim alone one Sunday evening.I have since revisited it twice with friends and family because there are precisely two moments - one around 45 minutes in during a TV debate and one towards the very end - which caught me so off guard the first time, I actually had to pause it to catch up with had happened. I then found myself frantically looking around an empty room to try and share the 'f me!' moment with someone before scrabbling around for my phone to text everyone I knew to see if they had seen it.A brilliant film with a great performance from Chastain.

It twists and turns and keeps everything in motion without being disruptive or contradictive in anything.The director does a wonderful job way above average.Cut is great without any flaws.TL;DR?High level political intrigue movie for everyone.

" REVIEW BY A REAL LOBBYIST
",0.0,-0.9142,2019-11-06 00:00:00,2,"The script is very self indulgent, as you would expect from left-wing Hollywood producers of every stature.As a lobbyist, there were piles of moments where the Direction failed or was overlooked. Telegraphed dialogue mostly in act 1 - pregnant pauses, unnecessary ego - most story-telling lobbyists are warm and smooth, not abrasive, that's why they are hired.I've seen an interview by the writer in which he claims to be a News junkie, obviously lacking in real life experience, but for most viewers that are pushing a gun ban agenda the film would still be entertaining.The key reveal is movie fabrication, a Senator who has worked years in the machinery knows better than to meet in that manner. More simply it would be easy to find a willing Senator to run a committee to bring down an offside unethical staffer.It also fails in it's very premise whether you are pro or anti gun - the guardians of the 2nd Amendment would never kneel because of a single indiscretion of a Senator trying to hold onto power.In conclusion Studios and smaller production houses are sidelining themselves from Billions of cinema dollars for not catering to all the fly over States that the acting fraternity wish didn't exist.There will be a correction, this is the history of all cultural movements. Still this film is good infotainment for Democrat voters and other lay voters without a vested interest."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9805,2019-10-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was excellent from opening scene to closing credits. Thought provoking and beautifully shot. The script is slick and the acting is top notch! A little far fetched but totally entertaining and riveting. Chastain and Strong are wonderful to watch and John Madden gets the absolute best from his entire cast. I'll add this one to my ""watch again"" list ."
" Powerful
",0.4215,0.9683,2019-10-11 00:00:00,10,"I see that Miss SLOANE is like the most of us hungry for more but she's powerful enough to counting when everyone else is tired or left behind she adores the details she get in deep and she knows herself well which given her the power she's careless about the method or the way she used as long as she will win she's like the wolf she study her victim you can't prevent the way she thinks but you try to protect yourself with prayer and some hope to face her but by the end we know who's the truly winner. Miss SLOANE is a fighter she is born like that like the most of us but she chooses to continue not to hide and when she's close to lose, she reborn. Miss SLOANE didn't win in the Box office 2016 but that movie was 100% talking about women power and impact and how they can start a war or even ended and that's why we see the women power till our day. So, I think the main purpose of the fail in the box office is that the movie discuss the legislative process of the law of guns even if there's high victims their life effected by this cuz ""no one will protect us like us"" so that's why the film is fail other than that if the film was discussing another story the box office number will be totally different."
" Unexpectedly great movie
",0.6249,0.7645,2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Everything is together for a great movie: good acting, twisting screenplay, fast pace. I find it odd that people are giving 1 star for this movie because of ""Anti-gun propaganda"" and "" Absurd portrayals of the people in the gun lobby"". This movie is NOT about the gun control-laws. It is a very strong twisting political drama about people fighting for the win itself vs. people fighting for what they believe in. And yes, it focuses on controversial topic."
" A political heist movie with lots of tempo
",0.0,0.9465,2019-09-20 00:00:00,9,"This is a great movie that is suspenseful right up to the very end.Miss Sloane is a political heist movie rather than a political thriller. You're never sure who is doing what exactly and where everyone stands, right up to the end. And it's got that heist-tempo, that fast rhythm that keeps you guessing.The film sparked up some mild controversy at release because the subject matter is a Senate bill on gun reform. This is a touchy subject only for Americans however, so any non-US watcher will be totally fine. Plus, while having an opinion, the film leaves the gun-debate itself surprisingly open with a great twist. The subject itself is therefore only a means to an end: to show how corruption works.No real niggles, performances are excellent, shots are great, director inspired... it's not a perfect ten though because the script can be a little over the top. But the exaggerations do suit the film. While keeping its cards close to its chest, it'll make you feel it has a very, very good hand. And when all cards are finally on the table in the finale, it does not disappoint.If you're anything like me, you'll be hanging on the chastised Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) her lips every single second."

" Great drama, superbly acted
",0.6249,0.9328,2019-08-01 00:00:00,7,"Miss Sloane stars Jessica Chastain as a ruthless Washington lobbyist risking everything on behalf of her ethics. Chastain is a solid lead in this well polished hybrid of character study and political thriller. The film feels very much in the now in that the exposition needed for a high concept plot is pushed through characters you are so busy loving to hate to notice the lack of a second dimension or even the simplicity of the narrative.The real ace up this film's sleeve is the clarity with which the lobbyist trade is presented. How influence over senators is sown, reaped and paid for. If an understanding of what a lobbyist actually does is what you're looking for, then you will get a lot of insight here. Playing out like a combination of Mad Men and House of Cards with some Devil Wears Prada thrown in for good measure, Miss Sloane wisely focuses upon the mechanics of this highly controversial, if not wholly parasitic profession. The behind closed doors activity of the build up to a senate bill is well dramatised here to the point where i can say that it is even informative.So, what we have is good, if not great acting, a fully loaded plot and high quality production value. I've described this film, I've also described several HBO mini dramas. What makes the feature length film Miss Sloane a feature length film is a question I want to ask. It's refreshing to cover a direct to DVD film for once that warrants this amount of minoucha i wanna add.I can pinpoint it to two things, one is the condensed character arc of the protagonist, second is the economy of the dialogue. Whether it was because of Chastain's performance or the intensifying manipulation of the score, but Sloane's outbursts over issues she really cares about feels very conscious on the part of the film. I am conflicted whether this interferes with the flow of the picture or plants the flag emotionally within a plot which is at times very hard to follow, especially when the film descends into mumblecore now and again.Secondly, as I said, the dialogue is at times too straightforward, even when considering the world in which the film inhabits. This as well was very noticeable and i consider it to be a necessary evil and it was a good decision to sacrifice dramatic resonance in order to sustain the pace of the film. There could have a better score, the more dynamic cinematography, but i think there is enough to make Miss Solane a proper feature film and not something resembling a TV drama omnibus.In conclusion, Miss Sloane is a high recommendation as a really good drama and political thriller."
" Entertainment at its best....
",0.4215,0.8256,2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, being that I had not heard one word about it. It's precise and on point, the acting is spectacular and the script is a work of genius.It has become one of my ""go-to"" films for when I need to feel empowered as a woman, and each time I watch it, I learn something new.I cannot believe Miss Sloane slipped past my radar when it was on the big screen - perhaps the marketing people forgot to attend the meeting.Anyway, believe me, you will not be sorry you watched it and it may too become one of your favorites."
" Sloane actually worked for free for Peterson Wyatt
",0.5106,0.8176,2019-07-12 00:00:00,9,"I assess the quality of a movie based on how long the movie lingers in my mind after watching it and how many times I want to watch it again in order to connect all the dots. And boy did I rewatch this movie a couple of times, it's just too sophisticated to only watch once. The note she receives in the beginning of the movie just after she exited the reception from Rodolfo Schmidt (Peterson Wyatt CEO) with his financial offer he is ready to pay if she leads the campaign against the gun lobby is exactly the same note her former assistant/now secret operative at Cole Kravitz & Waterman gives to her colleague/boss when resigning in one if the last scenes if the movie. It clearly is the same note stating that 'a conviction lobbyist can't only believe in her ability to win', on the back written ´for services rendered peterson Wyatt offers you $0'. She took the job for free because she was getting sick of defending causes not in line with her principles. She was desperate to prove herself she is more than just chasing a career founded on deception and lies, she has become ethical. It proved her point against what George Dupont , het former boss, described her by- just before she resigned: as someone who only cares about winning, not about ethics."
" Super brainy script, riveting performance
",0.5994,0.969,2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"Jessica Chastain is just mesmerising in Miss Sloane. What a powerhouse screen turn! She delivers the most devastating cutting lines with understated inflections, totally owning the dialogue and the character. The character is complex, morally ambiguous, but that's exactly what this film is about, and Ms Chastain delivers and more. This is not some cheap feminist gender PC movie or character. Miss Sloane is so complex you soon forget any gender issues you might have dragged in with you. Just as the scintillating acting makes you forget that you're watching Ms Chastain, so thoroughly does she morph into the character. Ms Streep, Mr Day Lewis, I hope you're paying attention. Actors need to become the characters they portray, not the other way around.
Production values are superb, supporting cast equally so, pace and editing are flawless. An absolutely superb piece of cinema all round. Bravo!"
" Miss Sloane or Molly's game
",-0.1531,0.9307,2019-06-24 00:00:00,1,"I'm not sure what I have I have seen because it's exactly the same character. The background is a little different, but everything else well it's about the same. Loved Molly's game so why should I see a copy of Chastain's performance. Didn't see enough of her movies to judge so I hope she isn't just a one trick pony."

I've just started getting into Jessica Chastian films and she is amazing. She plays her roles fabulously and she did Miss Sloane wonderfully. Emotionless she was but the film itself was interesting and factual. Defiantly recommend"

Jessica Chastain's performance stood out as the best I have seen in a long time. The plot was reminiscent of a John Grisham novel but even better."
" Despite Chastain's Best Effort..
",-0.5216,0.0,2019-05-10 00:00:00,2,Jessica was masterful as always but she could only carry such an agenda driven script so far. Unless you lean far left this movie most likely isn't for you.
" Could have been better
",0.4404,0.986,2019-04-16 00:00:00,6,"It's a nice watch, I mean it keeps you entertained till the end, once you catch up with a story that starts too fast. On the other hand, the political environment and the characters (including Miss Sloan) are just too filthy to leave you with a good vibe.That being said, as a movie it has some positives and negatives. I appreciated Jessica Chastain, of course, and her character, who is very sharp and more deep than it seems. I appreciated the thrills, the final twist, and the fast pace. The main plot is well written.But, I see three major flaws. First, Miss Sloan seems to have a supernatural intellect, her plots are just unbelievable, and this make the movie feel a bit fake and unsatisfying. Secondly, the supporting characters are just monodimensial sidekicks for supernatural Miss Sloan's show (Mark Strong in particular should have been given a more important part). Third, the first half is a bit forced, it's full of fast spoken lines that pretend to be witty, as if the writer was trying at all costs to build a smart and appealing environment; the second part is more natural and he finally succeeds, but that's exactly because... it's less forced.Overall it's an entertaining watch with an outstanding actress, but not much more.Oh, and the guns thing: it means nothing, they could have talked about pink tigers and the movie would have been the same. It's all about Miss Sloan's will to win, nothing more."
" Totally unbelievable plot makes a very bad movie.
",-0.4019,0.9954,2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,"I didn't learn about this movie until I watched ""The Debt"" staring Jessica Chastain, and I looked her up to see what she was in that I may have seen before. I thought she did a good job acting in that film, so I gave this one a chance since she was in it (as well as Sam Waterston and the brilliant John Lithgow). The reviews for this movie seem to be either very good, or very bad, but nothing in the middle. I have seen where several people remarked that the bad reviews were made by people who are against gun control and that the movie has nothing to do with gun control. I think the opposite holds true - the good reviews are made simply because the people who made them are for gun control, not because the movie is worthy of a high review. Make no mistake, this is a very bad movie.I have also seen where people admitted to making their review have a higher rating in order to ""balance out"" a bad review from someone else. I am not doing that here. I gave this movie a 2 simply because that is what I truly feel it deserves.The main review that comes up in IMDB says that this movie is ""not boring for a moment"". Nothing could be further from the truth. This movie is extremely boring from the beginning until the end, with only a very few scenes worth watching. I had a hard time keeping awake for most of the movie. The dialog is basic: not terrible, but not good either. There are a few quotable lines in the movie, but you can probably say that about any film. The basic plot is extremely predicable throughout, but it is also extremely hard to believe. If I am watching a fantasy (like ""Field of Dreams""), I can let my imagination take off and get sucked into a good story even if I know what I'm watching can't possibly take place in real life. The problem is this film is supposed to be believable, and in many ways it is far less believable than dead baseball players coming back to life just to play baseball in an Iowa cornfield. The main character of ""Miss Sloane"" does so many things that someone like her would simply not do, nor would she have been successful if she acted remotely like they way she is portrayed.The acting is okay, not horrible, but not that great either. Overall, Jessica Chastain's performance was very disappointing compared to how she performed in ""The Debt"". John Lithgow was his usual self, and he presented by far the best performance in the entire film. Many of the other supportive actors were not good, which may have also caused the movie to be extremely boring. There is nothing worse than having subpar acting combined with a terrible script, and this film is a classic example of that.The only good thing that this film has going for it is its musical score. The piece played during the closing credits is by far the best part of the movie, and I am not saying that just because I was grateful that the film was finally over, although that may have had something to do with why I enjoyed it so much.If you enjoy watching a movie to be preached to because you can't form your own opinion on political topics, then this film may be the perfect movie for you. If, however, you can think for yourself and watch films for pure entertainment value, then this film should be avoided since it fails miserably in that area."
" Great for the select few
",0.6249,0.993,2019-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Miss Sloane is a drama/ thriller about the character Madeline Elizabeth Sloane played by Jessica Chastain who plays a lobbyist in Washington D.C who is absolutely obsessed with winning. I've watched the movie many times but strictly for the plot not the story line. The movie Miss Sloane takes very strong political views on gun reform and exaggerates a lot of arguments on the issue. But on the other hand, Miss Slone is a very independent women who you can see has worked very hard to get where she was and that causes her to fear by basically everyone in Washington. The movies make her out to be the hero and villain who sees herself as a trump card for the greater good.
The plot in the movie is very entertaining to watch which is why I enjoyed the movie. Her quick comebacks and remarks make her stand out in this world which is obviously populated mostly by males. You see as Jessica Chastain's character fights for what she believes is right. Throughout the movie you can see her as very unpredictable. This women protagonist enjoys besting everyone to the punch and doesn't seem to ever lose. Even when her tactics are unethical and outrageous in her line of work that what she seems to need in order to win. Her ideas and executions are proof that she's perfect for politics and creates plans that could only be created in the mind of a women.
Storyline wise the movie isn't for everyone. If your have strong beliefs and ties into Gun reform politics, you will be bias on what happens in the movie. Miss Sloane shines a light on self-centered Politian's who have nothing to do better than destroy each other. Some might see the movie as a unrealistic way to portray all politicians who are not ""Lefties"". Ironically this movie was released in 2016 and you can't help to wonder if the movie was a satire to the election that same year.
I applauded the actors who created a world where you became immersed into the movie. Alison pill played in the movie as Jane Molloy is the underdog during the movie but comes out to be the trusted sidekick in the end taking everyone by surprise. No part of Miss Sloane was predictable and even after re watching the movie you see foreshow in earlier parts of the movie but it's never in a way that reveals the rest of the movie. For writer Jonathan Perera this was his first screenplay ever written by him, but the movie proves that he's had experience in the business. Versus the director John Madden whose best known for his movie Shakespeare in love in 1998 staring Gwyneth Paltrow. Rated R for language and some sexuality this movie is made for the select few who enjoy watching movies for fun."

" Miss Sloane Review
",-0.1531,0.9974,2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a feared DC lobbyist who angers her boss by turning down a job for a pro-gun group. She quits and moves to a firm which is backing a proposed law to impose regulations on firearms. But which side will win?
Smart, hard-nosed and blunt to the point of rudeness, Elizabeth Sloane is the kind of boss who has her underlings simultaneously cowering in fear while still craving her favour. If this film was made a decade ago, you could imagine her being played by Nicole Kidman (or, going further back, Linda Fiorentino) but in today's market, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job than Jessica Chastain. She inhabits every inch of this steely, powerful character who strides into boardrooms and instantly commands the attention of everyone present - rivals, employees, the audience.Chastain gives it everything she's got.
Chastain's performance is absolutely crucial to the success of this film, and she gives it everything she's got - amping up the kind of focused, driven intensity we saw in Zero Dark Thirty, while still bringing a glimpse of the vulnerability she displayed in Interstellar. A driven, busy woman, she keeps her colleagues at arm's length, doesn't appear to have any other friends and hires a male escort when she wants sex. It's this relationship that reveals most about who Sloane is - she's perturbed when, instead of getting her usual guy, another man, Forde (Jake Lacy), turns up instead. Reticent initially, she begins to see him more regularly and it's then we glimpse her true self.But, as is to be expected in films like this, the chief pleasure of Miss Sloane is watching her let rip at her colleagues and adversaries. However, there is a flip side - the most painful moments are when she does the same to her subordinates, something which crosses the line into emotional abuse. Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings warmth and heart as Esme, one of the favoured ones, but you sense that her place in the pecking order is precarious. She's not the only one: Sloane herself is putting her career on the line for the cause of gun control, although for some time it's hard to tell whether it's because she believes in it, or because she wants to prove she can win this particular battle.
Elsewhere, the film is dialogue-driven to an entertaining but almost exhausting degree: Aaron Sorkin is an apparent influence for debut screenwriter Jonathan Perera, a Brit who was working as a teacher in South Korea when his script got Hollywood attention. Inevitably, it's not as razor-sharp as Sorkin's work, but it's still a slick debut from a writer who claims his heroine was partly inspired by his mother (the good bits, anyway). Able supporting performances come from Mark Strong as Sloane's new boss Rodolfo Schmidt, and Alison Pill as her one-time right-hand woman Jane Molloy, although smaller characters tend to lean towards the simplistic.
It's a far cry from director John Madden's usual cosiness, seen in the likes of Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and by the time the ending comes along, some audiences may have lost patience. It's the kind of film that leaves questions in its wake in terms of plot detail, character background and even practicalities - where does she find the time to do her hair and make-up so professionally? If she's going for twice-daily blow-drys like Anna Wintour, we don't see it. But it's still an enjoyable two-plus hours and an impressive calling card for writer Perera, not to mention another feather in the cap for the Golden Globe-nominated Chastain. An Oscar nomination wouldn't have felt out of place, either.Hard to root for but mesmerising to watch, Sloane is expertly portrayed by Chastain in this dialogue-heavy lobbyist thriller that should please fans of both actor and genre."
" Would only watch if you're really bored
",-0.3384,0.0,2019-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Overly long, poorly casted, zero charisma and too long."
" Miss Sloane - The Lobby Vigilante
",-0.128,0.9887,2019-04-06 00:00:00,7,"As a championing lobbyist for gun-control, Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) guns ahead with her foresight on her own will to prove a majority on a Government bill whilst keeping a keen sight on opponent's moves. Seemingly, more than her own people come for blood - both on the bill and hers.Playing a game of chess much like poker, she paraphrases her game strategy as to go notches beyond oneself to tell and prove something real - where ""own interests are best served by doing the right thing for society as a whole"". So, come the motive being browbeaten, threatened, publicly humiliated - what does one do?The film astounds with the depiction of how lobbying seems corporate-like - in good way and otherwise. At times, the motives depicted seemed blurred in plain sight with pacey dialogues and deluded. Confusing as it may seem, still maybe that's how films treat our minds - we feel enough to stay.
Who knows, in the process we may also end up appreciating human virtue.
Hence, even though it's easier said than done - ""principles actually mean something when they are inconvenient to be followed"". Headstrong, hardboiled and you name it, our lady doesn't bendThankfully, big words, come along with bigger action. This film has an intricate screenplay (from first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera) sprawling with minute details on government lobbying for pushing bills into laws with articulate moves to thrust heroics of maneuvering the debates and people alike.
The screen-acting by the cast, though simple, comes as the grand motivation to not set this film down. In specific, Chastain is the reason that I wanted to watch this film and I am beyond glad to have done so.Also, glad enough to have remembered what could be best put in a quote from ""The Contender"" - ""Greatness... sometimes it comes in the form of 'sacrifice' - that's the loneliest form."""
" Weak All Around
",-0.4404,-0.9155,2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,"Ms. Chastain simply cannot portray certain characters - this film is one of those instances. Every second of her performance it is obvious that she is acting. I put it all on the director who in a juvenile manner presents a story that is so full of holes that within five minutes of the beginning one wants to vomit. Oh well, a wasted few dollars is not an earthquake. A story of immature thinkers who are opportunistic and immoral among opportunistic and immoral Senators and Representatives and the NRA. Ms. Chastain obviously is designed to be an imitation of the idiot clown trump - and lobbyists to be the vile reprehensible parasites that they are. Ms. Chastain's character supposedly is to be redeemed by her final act - hardly - it is just a middle school version of play-yard bullies among bullies. If one wants to watch middle school kids play, then this film is for you."

",0.6705,0.4281,2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,"More dirty politics and particularly prescient in the time of Trump. Elizabeth Sloane is a lobbyist whose failure to get into bed with the NRA seems to be her undoing, especially when she decides to change sides. It may or may not prove to be a smart move but this is a smart movie with a cracker of a script from Jonathan Perera, a typically high-powered performance from the always reliable Jessica Chastain and a terrific supporting cast that includes Mark Strong, John Lithgow, Michael Stuhlbarg, Sam Waterson, Alison Pill and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.It looks good and it sounds good but it's not likely to please the multiplex crowd; no matter how you dress it up, politics just aren't sexy and any plot concerning gun-control means you have to take your brain into the cinema with you, something most people aren't prepared to do these days so while Miss Sloane may be good at her job, and by all accounts no slouch in bed either, she will be fighting a losing battle at the box-office."

Jessica Chastain's character describes herself ""a piece of work"" and her performance brilliantly portrays an ultra-obsessionist, tough, driven, uncompromising, smart tough-cookie with laser-like focus in a high-stakes world of political power brokers. The dialogue is witty, but there is a point to be made that the rolling conversations are delivered unnaturally fast at times to be believable. The story has some awkward exposition and backstory too, and it resolves too neatly with an unconvincing road to redemption theme. Nevetheless, it is an absorbing contemporary drama with lots of interesting chicanery and a strong finish."

" This movie is about far more than the controversial gun debate
",-0.5367,0.9948,2019-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Yes, many will chose not to see this excellently made movie with a twisty plot just because it sounds like a liberal leaning gun debate story. But, it is far more than that. It is a most excellent exposé of the DC lobbying business. One that shows how lobbying is successful in influencing the outcomes of key legislation agendas, and manipulating the legislative process for good and evil ends. I would consider it more about modern politics than about any on important issue. The gun debate was merely the chosen vessel around which a plot could be spun. Great cast, compelling story line, excellent cinematography. It reminded me of the emotions evoked in me by the likes of award winning movies like The Firm, The Chamber and even A Few Good Men. But then, I love a movie that has a plot so twisted that the ending takes you completely by surprise."

" Lobby this way.
",0.0258,0.9864,2019-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Interesting movie which romanticizes the shady practices happening in an apparently civilized first world country. Honestly it's quite appalling. The movie truly delivers on how democracy can be bent to someone's will and the people's true will becomes instead second place to a few people's interests. It is really gripping and engaging and despite overly subtle hints, the final twist is quite convincing. Characters performances are more than adequate and the atmosphere, cinematography and pace distinguish this production from the average overrated pandering sequels of these days. What is somewhat lacking, is the handling of the inner trauma of one of the side characters. Never truly developed, nothing that really makes you care about it. It feels like a plot device. Like the somewhat perjury-worthy loyalty displayed near the end by yet another side character. Nothing earth-shattering, just nitpicking material. The movie is overall quite enjoyable."
" CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10)
",0.837,0.9923,2019-01-29 00:00:00,8,"The stage curtains open ...When you are a cutthroat lobbyist - you have no friends, no allies, no blueprint. All you have is the desire to win, no matter the cost - even if it means your own career. Just as long as you are the winner.And that is exactly what Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is. This is the story of Elizabeth Sloane, who is lobbying for senatorial votes to support a new bill that would enforce a stringent background check on gun purchases with the ultimate goal of reducing gun violence. In her efforts to wage war against her former firm, she is willing to give her all and sacrifice all to win. Always staying one step ahead of her opponents, always having a trump card ready to play when they play theirs - at the highest of costs.This was a well played out narrative with strong performances. Jessica Chastain was convincing and extremely effective in carrying this film, absorbing herself into the role of the ice cold lobbyist, willing to do whatever it takes and not caring about the consequences she will have to face in the end. Her character always has a sharp wit and even sharper tongue - but is limited by her tunnel vision, failing to care enough about those around her as she pursues her goal. Winning is more important to her than anything. Anything. And she knows this. There is no room for friendship when you have a job to do. Like she says in the movie, ""I'm a piece of work"".Overall, I did enjoy this film. It was entertaining and with a good ending. I was a little disappointed in her ""trump card"" though, and without revealing what it was, I will just say it was rather simple and cookie cutter. As simple as it was, it was effective. Also, the film runs a little long, but is able to hold your attention until the end. I would recommend this one if you enjoy a good political yarn."

It tries to show that pro-gun (2. Amendment) people don't have any justification for their position rather than ""it's the Constitution"". I mean, sure, it's fine to be on one side of the issue, but, trying to depict the other as simply idiots is _not_ fine. Don't show them at all, if you wish, show them very little, that's all fine. But, this, this is just terrible. Worse, their (her) position doesn't make sense. She advocates a bill to make background checks when buying guns compulsory, then compares that to driver's licenses!? She's _not_ advocating introducing gun licenses, so the comparisons is meaningless. Yet, she's supposed to be super-smart.Jessica Chastain's performance was praised, but, it seems by those who share these views. In reality, the only good thing is the consistency with which she plays Miss Sloane. But, she plays a soulless, misguided and unbelievably smart and powerful woman. Such a woman can't really exist, so, how can we say that she did a good job playing her?So, as a ""position statement"" or ""character study"", it is terrible. As a thriller, it's simply way-too-flawed. I don't care what drugs you take, if you're in your late 30s / early 40s and work 16 hours a day, and have been doing that for decades, you will be a half-dead zombie. You will _not_ be able to out-smart the whole gun lobby with their millions of people and dollars.Most of the twists make no sense what-so-ever, but let's focus on the last one. So, she anticipated that they will attack her, then gave them evidence to incriminate her, only to show evidence of their corruption?! She could have just shown the evidence of their corruption to the press and not incriminate herself. She wanted career suicide? Well, just incriminate yourself right away, that'll do it. She wanted to also win? Hm, she does want a lot, doesn't she? But, even so, there is no real reason why this would make it easier to win. The corrupt senator will not vote on any bill any more (and it will be a long time before he's replaced), so, that 's a _negative_ for her - it would be more prudent to _turn_ him on her side. Others will simply be appalled at the tactics employed by her lobby, including spying on their colleagues. There is actually _no_ _way_ that her bill would get the 60 votes after that. Most likely, the bill would be withdrawn and maybe tried in a few years, when the dust has settled.Also, I don't know if this was an inside-joke, but, when she instructs the people at the Senate hearing to go to a website with evidence of senator's corruption, she gives an IPv4 address, with last part being '.449' - this is _not_ a valid IPv4 address, it has to be at most '.255'. The inside joke here being ""the whole thing is as valid as the IPv4 address"".The most bare propaganda is at the end, when she says that prison is OK, ""if you don't have a penis"". According to her, women form support groups in there. I mean, this is just brain-dead. We all know what goes on inside women's prisons. Sure, it's different than in men's, but, these are not ""tea party and gossip group"" social clubs.It's a shame to some extent. Some ideas are OK, providing a one sided view is also OK, Jessica Chastain is actually well cast here. But, they just went way too far and made a piece of propaganda.Just skip it, even if you are an anti-gun feminist."
" A buried classic!
",0.0,0.982,2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie got lost in the financial problems of its parent company, Europa, which is also Luc Besson's production company. That's why it never got a proper US release. Which is a great shame because it would have cleaned up at the Academy Awards. Best Actress, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Screenplay. It would have cleaned up. And Jessica Chastain's performance will be studied by acting students for a generation at least. She is magnificent as Miss Sloane. Mark Strong is excellent as her boss, Sam Waterson (Law and Order) does a great job as her lobbyist adversary.
I won't divulge the script except to say that the gun people have it wrong railing against the ""liberal Hollywood types"" making a case against gun ownership. First, it's only about mandatory background checks, nothing more. And second, it's a DAMN MOVIE. Calm down. They used guns as a plot point because it's dramatic. That's all. If it had been rice cakes that was the subject, nobody would watch it. Not that rice cakes aren't kind of dramatic but not enough to fund a movie over their sale and use. Can't hunt with a rice cake.
I'm not anti gun. I used to be but I lost my passion for it after Charlottesville. A world full of alt-right loonies and white supremacists, makes concealed carry mandatory.
But this movie isn't about Charlottesville or any other real life incident. Nevertheless it's brutally effective in making its point.
One of the best performances I've seen in many years. A terrific script too. Directed by a veteran film director. Great supporting cast. What's not to like?
It's a 10, without reservation."
" The movie is an orgasm for the mind
",0.0,0.9952,2018-12-25 00:00:00,9,"This two year old political thriller is one you need to watch if you've missed it before. Tired of flashy special effects flics, fantasy or bang bang shoot 'em up with martial art big screen productions, hungry for an intellect teaser that satiates you? Well then, Miss Sloan is for you.I'd read the Europacorp storyline on IMDb to start with if you haven't heard of the movie; then I'll add here for you to read, my semi spoiler: A driven lobbyist leaves big firm to work for smaller one because she is hungry for the big impossible win that could catapult her at the very top; she takes on the gun industry that is represented by the firm she quit, to represent the gun control movement represented by a boutique, as she calls it, lobby. You will think of Miss Sloan as a, forgive the language, 'b i t c h' for most of the movie because it's intended, but you will admire her in the end, as her most outspoken critic, attorney Daniel Posner, played by David Wilson Barnes, did.The dialogue is at times delivered at dizzying speed because the characters have minds that think that quickly and with beautiful precision. The plot, as you'll no doubt discover with delight, is like a chess match between Magnus Carisen and Garry Kasparov; you can almost predict the outcome, not quite, but you couldn't guess when, how, let alone why it had to be, until you saw it with your own eyes and had time to reflect on it while the movie credits roll down the screen.Director John Madden has an impressive filmography and I am not the least bit surprised that twice Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain, star of the movie, wanted to do this film as she read the script. Both Madden and Chastain were on board from the start and the quality of the script explains also why it was produced in such a short start to finish record time.The cast has some of my favourites, John Lithgow, Mark Strong, Sam Waterston, Allison Pill and many others. They performed brilliantly, like a well synchronized philharmonic playing anything from Litz to Wagner. It's a joy when each performing contribution fits like clockwork and never misses a beat. You can't fault anyone.The writer, Jonathan Parera, wrote Miss Sloan, his first foray in screen writing using Aaron Sorkin approach and style, and when he teamed up with fame director John Madden, nothing short of a winner was in the works.
There is implied sex, but no nude scenes, gun shots are fired, but no one dies, all is focused on the development of the story, nothing unnecessary is used to make the movie work.
I highly recommend it it if you like brilliant written thrillers."
" Far From Reality
",0.0,0.9322,2018-12-09 00:00:00,3,"I think there is something to be said for movies reflecting reality as much as possible. Unless the category is fantasy of course. In Miss Sloane you have another film with beautiful faces, choppy dialogue, crisp banter back and froth, and unrealistic timely deliveries. None of which is the real world. I've seen board rooms and high-stakes meetings at a smaller level; albeit small organization board rooms and non-profit board rooms, none of them had a room full of everyone around the same age. Also absolutely none had no one above the age of 50! These movies can be made without being so far away from reality and still be beautiful to look at and interesting to listen to. The crisp and timely dialogue comes off as memorized speech - which it is; but, which it should not sound like. No one delivers words this way. Movies can reflect the real world and still deliver a script that audiences want to hear! The dialogue is too sharp and perfect. The cast is too young and the lead character's performance is way over the top."
" A bit too much talking and arguing for me.
",-0.4588,-0.6254,2018-12-09 00:00:00,6,"Maybe I'm a bit harsh with my ratings for this one, but let just say that the story isn't the kind of story that I have alot of interest for in real life. Or at least I don't think much good of it. The lobbying industry is perfectly portrayed in Miss Sloane. It's exactly what I think about those kind of people, arrogant and self-centered, people that will walk over bodies to get what they want. The biggest part of the movie I was just listening to their constant arguing, and I have to admit that that is not my favorite thing to do when watching a movie, certainly not if it goes back and forth very quickly, about things I don't care. The acting is good though. Jessica Chastain as Madeline Elizabeth Sloane, plays her role of unpleasant coldhearted b*tch as the best. You won't get any sympathy for her. In fact not many characters are pleasant, as they are all lobbyists or politicians, and those are people I don't have a high opinion of. But the end of the movie was unexpected and made up a little for me. I thought it was a very good ending for once."

",0.6249,0.9245,2018-11-06 00:00:00,9,"What a great movie, it uses the ""gun control"" debate as a vehicle to show the corruption and complete mess that is US politics.I am guessing that there are a lot of people who mark this at the lower end of the scale because they don't quite understand the underlying message here - its a first rate political thriller and not really anti-gun at all. However, it does show the absurdity of peoples reactions both on IMDB and in the film to what is after all was such an innocuous small change to the law and the lengths politicians will go to depending on how it affects their political aspirations.If you can't see past your own blinkered vision and accept that its a great story backed up by fine performances by everyone involved especially Chastain, then I feel sorry for you, if however, you have an IQ above that of an amoeba then prepare yourself for a really enjoyable, captivating, roll coaster like 2 hours of your time."
" Excellent film, but a few niggling plot points weigh it down
",0.3291,0.5187,2018-10-16 00:00:00,8,"For all the smart manoeuvres and spiel of being ""one step ahead"", Miss Sloane, as far as I can tell, is the only character who is actively breaking the law. She signs off on the illegal state visit to Indonesia and she is using illegal surveillance against not only her opponents, but also her team. The other side of the table, so to speak, only uses the traditional political strong-arming to gain support and even the conversation between Dupont and the Senator is unprofessional rather than illegal - he presents evidence that Sloane has been involved in unethical practices and should therefore be investigated, and threatens the Senator into running a formal line of inquiry. For all the talk of moral high ground we are force fed by the pro-gun control side in this film (regardless of which side of the debate you're on, it's hard to ignore the blatant agenda), it is ironic that Miss Sloane herself is the most corrupt character.Putting this aside, the film is a quality production - the cinematography is great, the story is good and Jessica Chastain does a fantastic job in the main role. Definitely worth a watch."
" wonderful Chastain performance
",0.5719,0.9757,2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,"Jessica Chastain is ""Miss Sloane,"" a 2016 film directed by John Madden and also starring Sam Waterston, Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alison Pill, Jake Lacy, and John Lithgow.Elizabeth Sloane is an aggressive lobbyist who lets nothing stand in her way when she wants to achieve a goal. The film begins with her being called to give testimony at a congressional hearing that accuses her of violations of Senate ethics.In flashback, we see that the firm she works for is approached to lead the opposition to a gun bill expanding background checks. Sloane instead goes to work for Rodolfo Schmidt (Strong), with another lobbying firm, to get the bill passed.What a brilliant film, so relevant to today, particularly Chastain's monologue at the end of the film. All the performances are excellent, but she is amazing as an outspoken and tough woman whose work is everything to her.The film has an interesting twist at the end.I never considered Chastain a beauty - I never thought she photographed very well - but she indeed is very beautiful, and her formidable talent matches her looks.Truly a must-see. And so true to life!"

",0.0772,0.8481,2018-06-25 00:00:00,9,"First of all let me comment on the incredibpe rising actress which was fantastic in the role of Sloane. 
The film takes time to cook and does not exactly grab you from the start, you do need concentration on the subtleties it proposes and will leave you both astonished and angry by how it unfolds. 
It is deep and fascinationg, the character of Sloane is certainly not the typical female that follows restricting rules of society about how women must behave, and for that it is reverting and deserves any award for honesty."
" Only For Those Fascinated by Lobbyists

(For the record, I'm a hunter and army veteran whose just fine with most gun restrictions.) Neither high nor low ratings are justifiable. Contrary to the claims of those giving it high ratings, the issue of guns IS central to the plot, action, character motivations, almost everything. Contrary to those giving it 1s, this film is NOT ""propaganda."" In fact at one point a ludicrous thing happens that's in accord with gun rights mythos: A civilian is saved by another armed civilian. That's pretty rare, contrary to open carry types' wishful imaginations of themselves as Dirty Harry.The problem with the film is that, as it deals with lobbyists, it must given us long expositions of talking points on all sides. This is about as exciting as drying paint. By the time the predictable ""twist"" about corruption was revealed, you'll be ready to fall asleep.The sole saving grace is the lead actress's driven performance. No other reason to see this.

DUPONT to SPERLING: ""You know the root of the word ""annihilate""? It's Latin. It means ""to reduce to nothing"". Ok, first, I'm pretty sure a US Senator knows what annihilate means why are they explaining to the audience?, second, it's derived from annihilare meaning ""reduce to nothing"", but the ROOT of annihilate is nihil, meaning ""nothing"". It's so awkward and clunky!! The playback in the courtroom makes it more effective but the dialogue is so dis-believable.SLOANE: ""It rewards rats who are willing to sell out their country to keep their noses in the trough. Make no mistake, these rats are the real parasites on American democracy."" The expression is pigs at the trough, and rats are vermin not parasites.I like Jessica Chastain, I think the lengthy dialogues and monologues killed her, she gets the timing breathing and emphasis in her phrasing wrong all the time, from the very beginning of the movie. It was distracting. The accents are bad, Lacy as a Southerner is painful, and is Connors supposed to be from Boston? Why do they even NEED accents??There is so much exposition and over explaining to the audience, there is so little nuance or deftness.In the end I didn't care about any of the characters, I didn't care whether the bill passed or was defeated. I didn't care if she went to jail or not. I had zero investment.I guess the surprise ending is satisfying, if also clunky, but I barely made it through."

She does, however, understand what makes people tick, which is why she is an excellent lobbyist. She is working for a firm which is seeking to generate senatorial support for a bill to require greater background checks for those buying firearms: the gun lobby is fiercely opposed to this. All this is presented within a framing story by which we know that there is a senate hearing into Sloane's alleged rule breaking during her lobbying activities.Let me say at the start that this film engages the interest at the start and holds it throughout. It is a great pleasure to find one's brain in use all the way through over two hours of a movie: the story is fresh and always moving, with much drama along the way. Never difficult to follow, it has a couple of dramatic high points along the way, and a great ending - fair, but unexpected. I really liked the story here.While I like Jessica Chastain on chat shows, I always find her performances a little cold. That very coldness suits Liz Sloane, however, and Chastain really impresses here. The rest of the cast are good too, providing some of the emotional connection which Liz Sloane can't (or doesn't) offer. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is as impressive as she was in Belle.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but I did, a lot."

However, I can't completely dismiss this piece of propaganda because it's undeniably well-made. Also, it accurately portrays many aspects of DC lobbying underbelly. Finally, Jessica Chastain is a tremendous actor, and her performance in this film is no exception.

" Artistic Issues
",0.0,0.9115,2018-04-22 00:00:00,6,"Workable script, fully capable acting, good sets/costuming... but it looks like either 1) ham-handed direction, or 2) the director's interest in nuance tuned to the wordiness of the script getting derailed by the producers pulling rank.Could have been worse, but this is something towards which I feel especially sensitive.It highlights a really important fact about big budget production: Too often producers think they have the ingredients for something produce-able and distribute-able, but don't realize the demands that certain kinds of narrative place on the product. In fact, it looks like they don't even realize that the script, itself, should carry weight in that process. They defer to the knowledge they feel they have about the movie-going public; that too many of them are like babies with disposable income, who don't understand English but are innately attuned to facial expression and body language: And films are busy-box light shows of emoting.As a result, the film all-too-often squawks and gesticulates. The producers refused to let the script breathe.Too bad!Add to this that the script, itself, seems a little strained and the flick doesn't have much of a chance to work on its proper merits; a timely subject matter (guns), coupled with a well-intentioned ""insider"" look at political gamesmanship.I'm suddenly reminded of a time long ago, in university, during Watergate, when I went to meet with a student club to practice for an upcoming performance. Oddly, someone found us a practice space in a building that had adjacent conference rooms, and one of these rooms was hosting a convocation of monied suits considering bankrolling a rock band. I was invited in to listen to the tune and drop my own two-bits on the marketability of the song ""product"". The weird thing was that the band used a two-bit cassette recorder, and the tape was so bizarrely saturated that I couldn't even make out the melody... let alone the accompaniment! And certainly not the words. But think about the mindset of these dozen-or-so business dudes listening to this thing, driven to consider putting money behind it because... it was about Watergate.Well, art *matters*. Miss Sloane may be about guns--and very passionate it is about that. But it misses (a bit) as an artistic product."

Miss Sloan says ""we just want background checks because a terrorist can buy a gun."" Both claims are absolutely false. They never mention that Illegals killed 50,000 unarmed Americans in only five years. Naturally they refuse to defend our borders to stop this.Their solution to gun deaths is take our guns away. Where do people think guns will come from if they are banned in the USA? Mexico of course. Hollywood scriptwriters give brilliant actors powerful speeches but never reveal the facts. They are afraid we will not agree with them if we know the truth. On that single point they are right. The big argument here is: ""we do not want to take away guns, only close a few loopholes,"" but that is a lie.Adam Corolla illustrated with cigarettes how the left operates. They tell you ""we just want to close the loopholes."" The first thing they said about cigarettes was ""we just want to keep them away from the kids"" (give them pot instead) so new laws forbade selling to minors. Then restaurants put in no smoking sections. Then they banned cigarettes in the whole restaurant. Then they banned them in bars. Then they banned them in all buildings and now they are targeting homes. The left never just wants what they tell you. They lie.They attacked meat in the 60's and switched everyone to cereals because of several fraudulent studies. Immediately obesity began skyrocketing. Why? Because cereals raise blood sugar too fast and then it crashes and we are hungry again so we eat more and more. Meat is vital protein that does not raise blood sugar and meat keeps you eating less because we are sated on less food much longer. Why did they want people to get really fat and sick? Because they wanted us in need of massive health care. People were far too healthy, active, and independent in the 60's.I looked up the government statistics. There are almost 4 million home. invasion robberies and 32,000 deaths from them annually. Almost none occurred at homes where gun ownership was probable or neighborhoods that were known to be armed. The UK has far more robberies per capita than we do. 9,000 Americans per year are killed by illegals and about half of that from guns. The other half by vehicles. We also know that areas where guns are illegal have even more crimes and deaths by criminals. Criminals can always get guns. None of these facts are mentioned. No opponent of the caustic but superior Jessica Chastain is reasonable. How does the terrible phalanx of right wing white males take down the beautiful Miss Chastain? A dubious and salacious personal attack. Now that sounds all-too familiar in Washington D.C., but never from the right, always from the left."

You can see how one is invincible and how the Big Sam is taking it all down the gutter.

" A good film with an interesting subject matter
",0.6908,0.9982,2018-02-05 00:00:00,7,"This film has had positive word of mouth so I was interested in watching this film and I have now seen miss Sloane and I enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees a high ranking lobbyist take on a powerful opponent and realise what goes too far in a campaign. Jessica Chastain plays Sloane in this film and she does an excellent job in this film, she does a fantastic job in the emotional scenes to add weight to all the power scenes she is involved with. She adds a lot of depth to her character and makes you question whether you should be rooting for her and get behind her character. The supporting cast all do a great job, Mark strong plays her partner in this film and he does a great job. He plays off of her very well with Chastain and you see his point of view contrasting hers and making you question which way too look at the whole scenario. Guru mbatha-raw is a great actress and she has a truly good character in this film, the way her relationship with Chastain really develops well and you see both of their characters being put into tough situations and how she reacts feels very real. John Lithgow has a smaller role in this film but when he is on screen he gives his usual best to get the most out of the role. Everybody else in the film do good jobs in there roles to add to the film. The story is pretty complex and interesting, you see this woman attempt to do anything to make sure she comes out on top but you understand why she is doing it. However, I feel like that the subject matter could have had more shades of grey in it instead of the black and white nature that the film uses which I think missed a trick. Also there is one storyline involving a relationship for Sloane bored me and felt tacked on and unnecessary. The script has some really quick convincing dialogue that helped makes these characters feel more interesting, but I feel like they overcomplicate some of the dialogue and breeze over some important scenarios that leaves you a bit lost at times. The style of the film has some good dramatic scenes, especially in the courtroom scenes, where the drama is really good. Though, I feel that the pacing is a bit off and a good 15 minutes could have been shaved off the film's runtime and it would have been a better film. Overall miss Sloane is an interesting film that is worth a watch, but it isn't the best film of its kind."

The latter played up somewhere between a barking, permanently angry Sam Waterson (is there any other kind) and the ever-brilliant steel-faced Jessica Chastain.The subject of gun lobbying and the US 2nd Amendment is something so mired in unsolvable rhetoric I'll admit it gave the script a dull edge for me from the outset.The script allows for a lot of grand-standing and melodrama around every corner, the lobbying-team band-and-forth know-it-all banter a little old-hat at this point and very much sub-Sorkin. It's also not particularly believable.The only really interesting part of the film for me was Chastain, sticking to her steely resolve while finding new moral depths -- but a few times in the (rather lengthy) running time reveals that she might be human after all, in some well-played scenes in the latter third of the film.The denouement is so ridiculously over-the-top, in pure Hollywood style, that it did bring a measure of humour for me to a film otherwise lacking any."

If only gun freedom can stop the wrong usage of guns, Jesus would just use gun instead of preaching and being a perfect model to ""show them your left/ right cheek if they slap the other cheek."" If violence can end violence, Ghandhi, Mother Teressa, Buddha, Jesus, Mandela would have seek to restore peace, inner calmness and benefit to all using violence and war. They did not. The arguments of gun control has been on and on for years, things may be even more absurd when there is a president who seldom resort calmness and inner wisdom. While USA continues to earn money by exporting guns, weapons, how is it possible for USA to have less gun violence within its border? If I were to be rich, I will be rich no matter what occupation/ business I engage in. I don't have to sell weapons to make myself rich.

" Mind-blowingly intriguing intro to the world of Washington lobbying
",-0.0772,0.9952,2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"Remarkably, what looks like the ultimate inside track on the workings of Washington comes from British Director John Madden and Asian-resident writer of Portuguese descent Jonathan Perera. They can be rightfully proud of their achievement, which looks supremely - scarily - authentic, even though for moments at least, it seems to be descending into comedy, only to recover its composure again quite rapidly. If that is an intentional approach (and who is to say it is not?), it is both interesting and unusual, and only serves to further raise the class of the film.Obviously, the makers here are helped along massively by a splendid performance from Jessica Chastain as the titular Liz Sloane. Chastain achieves something rather miraculous (or at least she did with this viewer). So intricate is her version of the art of lobbying that - in early parts of the film - her belting out of instructions to her team that are as devious as they are complex went entirely over my head. Having first chastised myself, I later paused to realise it was a compliment. Without at least 6 months of experience of what Sloane herself dubs a ""rotten"" system, I am obviously going to lack the necessary cunning and immorality. Sloane has of course mastered all that long since, but is anyway driven, powered along by pills, eats every day in just one restaurant for the sake of sustenance, has nothing or nobody but her work, consorts with a male prostitute from time to time to simulate the necessary part of married life, and has no regrets whatever that she has no more ties than that. Hence, in the early part of the film, she looks like a thoroughly obnoxious, and certainly very scary, person.But Chastain works her magic in the role, and at some point begins to look more and more skilled, masterly and - let's not beat around the bush here - pretty darn sexy. What's more, she evokes a measure of sympathy/empathy that comes out of nowhere, entirely unexpectedly. Somehow, she makes a heroine our of herself, on the basis of her 100% anti-hero status. Conceivably, there might actually be something deep in her persona that a person could even love (all the more so as she reveals a new aspect to herself in the altered circumstances present at the end of the film). This is then a force-of-nature, yet actually quite nuanced kind of performance which looks like work of a high level.Quite a few other familiar faces can be made out in the film, mostly playing worse-than-pond-slime roles; but a joyous exception is Mark Strong (effortlessly supporting an American accent in place of his otherwise much-in-demand British one) - playing perhaps the only lobbyist in America with a few scruples still intact. Jake Lacy also offers a surprisingly warm and well-done performance in his apparently-rather-thankless role.Ultimately, this persuasive, slick, unusual and plausible film seems to offer both an entertainment and an education at one and the same time, and I am grateful to have come across it."

While the movie addresses a multitude of pro-gun regulation points, it does powerfully hit on a couple pro-gun rights points.

" Great political thriller with one major shortcoming
",0.6705,0.9498,2017-10-14 00:00:00,8,"As entertainment, this is a very solid entry, as long as your take on entertainment goes beyond escapism. The acting is beyond great, the technical aspects mastered (even if my personal taste has an issue with the OST), you really feel sucked into the story. Chastain portrays what many reviewers have described as an unlikable character, which destroyed the movie's appeal for those very same reviewers, supposedly bummed to see a beautiful Hollywood star portray a sociopath or at the very least not a nice person. Oh my... All those reviews about Taxi Driver sucking so hard because the main character wasn't nice, and let's not forget about Citizen Kane! Sigh...The real issue with the movie though, is that beyond the fact that it needs a perfectly acceptable suspension of belief in key moments, it kind of shoots itself in the foot :The movie kind of bombed on the box office, and it's hard not to see why, since it was mostly distributed in the US. But how hard was that to predict when it actually tackles gun control - in the most rational way - but lets the righteous side win the war? In reality, the gun lobby is winning, and we get a fiction happy end, which serves no purpose but reinforce both sides in their own set of belief. If despite all the good will, efforts and moral justification, the pro gun control side didn't win, the message would probably be much more effective, but admittedly a downer.So the movie is indeed highly entertaining, as a piece of Hollywood thrill, because in the end, that's all it is. If it really intended to serve the cause of gun control, it would need to take darker turns, at least in my opinion.But I won't lie, I was entertained and thrilled, it's just not close to as political as the producers wished you to believe it was."

I do not see it coherent, unless you bring to extremes things that are not usually so. This woman does not need to treat men like that, she would have enough.There is one thing that has surprised me. It seemed that the movie was going in one direction and then towards the end, it gives a twist that I did not expect, but of course it was getting into an impossible place in the American world. The problem is that the end of the film, I believe that there is no one who believes it, who would do that with his career? He has a beautiful photograph. But not great either. For many moments it is not even good.The address, telling me that it is rolled up a lot and is not counted and I read a lot, because I do not think good.

This woman has plenty of men and for time, either, it does not take five minutes to convince anyone.The final twist, when the citizen saves his colleague, I come to think that I prepared it before they said it in the film.

" Really badly made
",-0.5256,0.5536,2017-09-20 00:00:00,1,"This is a terrible film, which I had to turn off before the end because it was essentially incomprehensible. The worst thing about the film is the extremely low quality of the sound recording. Added to that, many of the actors and especially Jessica Chastain speak so fast and so inarticulately that it is what I would call 'fast mumbling'. They obviously did this in order to try to supercharge their scenes and make them come across 'dramatic'. (When a scene is not dramatic enough, try shouting and looking fierce, and maybe viewers will be fooled into thinking that is drama.) But fast mumbling and ferocious grimaces are no substitute for a good script. This script is really, really bad. I hate to say that about a first time screenwriter, but it is true. And why were there no rewrites by other writers, as usually happens in cases like this? This script could have been shaped up by someone more experienced. Bad judgement call by producers and director. The story is rambling and people shouting at each other is not drama, it just isn't. Jessica Chastain overdoes it in trying to be a 'tough gal'. She is not convincing, but comes across as someone trying too hard. The director should have seen this and helped her out. Even bad casting can be 'handled', but it needs attention. The whole film is something of a parody, without any subtlety or sophistication. Compared to such a subtle and sophisticated TV series as HOUSE OF CARDS with Kevin Spacey, which roars like a lion, this film does not even qualify as a whimpering puppy cringing in a corner. The film has been much hyped, and a remarkable number of reviewers love it, but I fear they are kidding themselves. It is just not a good movie. Jessica Chastain is inadequate and is not all that the hype about her suggests. She also lacks 'screen magic', since she does not make for compulsive watching. When dealing with a subject such as this, the first thing to do is great a really sophisticated script written. Then you cast the lead woman with someone people cannot take their eyes off, i.e. someone who has irresistible 'watchability'. There are plenty of such actresses, but Chastain is not one of them, at least not in this kind of film. Also, an English director for a film about the intrigues of Washington lobbyists was a really bad idea. The film needed an American director who was more familiar with the many intricate subtleties of the complex American political scene than John Madden could possibly be, charming and talented fellow though he is. But he is English. He can tell you all about Shakespeare in love, but he is not versed in the ways of Washington insiders. And how could he be? This film is, I fear, an utter failure."
" 132 minute commercial for gun control
",-0.34,0.7074,2017-09-20 00:00:00,4,"Miss Sloane (2016) stars Jessica Chastain as a high strung, pill-popping Washington DC lobbyist who takes on the Gun Lobby in this dead-on-arrival political thriller. Elizabeth Sloane is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in Washington, D.C., but when her firm agrees to take on an effort to convince women to support the 2nd Amendment, she has a change of heart and joins a lobbying firm fighting for gun control.According to IMDb.com, Miss Sloane had a budget of $18 million and made an embarrassing $59,797 in its opening weekend. As of December 14, the movie had grossed $2.6 million. Ouch. All indications point to a decent film. Good pacing, unexpected plot twists, solid acting–so what went wrong? Well, audiences don't really want to sit through a 132 minute commercial for gun control.Let's start there. It's not surprising a political thriller would have a political message, but this film wears its bias on its sleeve. It is replete with left wing stereotypes of conservatives, who it portrays as elderly white men enthralled to the gun lobby. When confronted with a plan to create a pro-gun women's group, Miss Sloane is flabbergasted, unable to believe any woman would support an originalist view of the 2nd Amendment. (Oops, those groups already exist, WAGC and AFA to name two.) Through Miss Sloane's later exposition, the audience is actually treated to a point-by-point refutation of arguments against gun control, making you feel like you're attending a lecture rather than watching a movie.Suspension of disbelief is an important element of any fiction. The audience is willing to accept incredible or fanciful events so long as those events adhere to a certain internal consistency or logic. Miss Sloane's premise, however, was simply unbelievable. Elizabeth Sloane is portrayed as tireless and high strung, a control freak who pays for meaningless sex, uses others to further her goals, and employs illegal surveillance techniques. She is, in short, a sociopath without empathy who until that point was willing to take on any lobbying effort as long as it paid.So we're expected to believe that when it comes to gun control, she suddenly feels powerful pains of conscience that lead her to put her entire career, her freedom, and her reputation on the line? Perhaps something in her past compelled her to feel so strongly about this particular issue? If so, it's not even hinted at. Her decision to put everything on the line for this cause is simply not believable.Equally unbelievable is her incredible foresight, in which she is able to gain the upper hand over her opponents even in the face of a Congressional investigation and jail time for illegal surveillance. The audience is led to believe Sloane anticipated these events and planned for them months in advance, all while flying around the country to put together a multi-million dollar political action committee. While a satisfying and clever ending, it stretches suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.As an anti-lobbying film, Miss Sloane is inferior to Casino Jack (2010), a Canadian film about real-life lobbyist Jack Abramoff staring Kevin Spacey. That movie also tanked at the box office, but at least it was entertaining, clever, and true-to-life. Like Elizabeth Sloane, Jack Abramoff enjoys peddling influence, but he maintains his character to the bitter end. He never suddenly develops a conscience because the plot requires it.People go to the movies to be entertained, to escape the stress and monotony of daily life. After a contentious election in which politics saturated the airwaves and social media, does anyone really want to sit in the theater and watch a two-hour long finger wagging session on lobbying and gun control? So far, audiences have stayed away from Miss Sloane, answering that question with a resounding, ""No!"""

First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path.It opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period. There's a voting is to take place in the parliament for the introduction of a new bill. The miss Sloane's firm splits over differences and hence two teams fight for one another in the same matter, but to achieve the opposite result. Pursuing the MPs and all other dramatic events takes place, while they are ready to go any length. Then the story comes to an end with a twist with one of them victorious, but a heavy price has to pay it.You might won't like the politics, but this is not one. This is something like the story of an election campaign team. How they work to achieve their goal, particularly keep checking their rivalry. So it was more or less a cat-mouse game kind, but the perspective was not shared equally. The majority of the film was from miss Sloane's angle. Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race. She should have won the best actress award. I might a little late to watch, but I did not miss it. So I hope you too as well not to miss it.8/10"

She is self-obsessed, arrogant, ambitious, rude, narcissistic, manipulative, totally unlikable, etc but despite all this I feel we are expected, in the long run, to admire and begrudgingly like her, why? because she was amazingly clever and most importantly she won. Is this seriously the most important thing in the long run? Is the perception of American society having a ""win at all costs ""mentality actually true? I hope this makes people question their values and leads to discussion on morals/ethics etc and the realisation that no matter the issue, that you don't have to cheat in order to catch a cheat, to become a villain to catch one etc. Hopefully such discussion was the writer's intent, its just such a shame that it was via such a truly despicable character."

Is it right to use dirty methods to do a good thing? Is Miss Sloane the hero or the villain? Will the cast ever stop speaking like a machine gun to give out the impression that everybody is smart and competent?The problem with the film was the writing, mostly. It wasn't bad, just sloppy. It made it difficult to focus on the moral of the story while it was gearing towards an obvious reveal. And so many good actors were completely underused: Mark Strong, John Lithgow, Alison Pill, even Jake Lacy and Sam Waterston.

" A fun fast ride through contemporary political lobbying
",0.4588,0.0789,2017-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Miss Sloane (2016)A hyped up political ""thriller"" that showcases Jessica Chastain as a lobbiest who is always one step ahead of her peers. And enemies. It becomes a game of wits and tricks, with the viewer led astray by normal gullibility. It's fun, and it clicks along with increasing drama. Chastain at first might seem a little miscast— not quite hard headed enough to be so cunning and heartless—but it settles in eventually. Her invimcibility (at first) is not credible, I suppose, but this is a fictional wild ride through what is probably a shabby world of bribes and begging between lobbyists and politicians. The underlying points about gun control are feel-good for gun control types, but a bit thin in their development.We never really learn what drives this woman, though a couple of hints suggest a nasty past. It's probably okay that it avoid sentiment on that score, but it makes all her machinations plot driven instead of motivated from within. Director John Madden has a resume of t.v. productions and a few movies that have an obvious hook to them (""Marigold Hotel"") and you get the sense that this is designed to be clever and entertaining above all. No depths here, in psychology, in political critique, or in movie-making.Which is fine. Well done. It does exactly what it wants to do."

I am not saying any of this to promote feminism nor am I woman, this just purely independent of that whole debate.people mentioning pro NRA reviews, who try to attack the movie. sorry - the movie is spot on, Washington is dirty and for sure, the NRA is. they can totally destroy people's careers and I have seen the dirty they pull first hand."

" A Political Thriller...Almost
",0.0,0.9893,2017-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a charismatic woman who lives by two simple rules...always plot one step ahead of the opponent and only play the final trump card after the opponent has played theirs. She attracts and keeps young talent like Jane Molloy (Alison Pill), a bookish protegee, and Esme Manucharian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a damaged gun violence survivor, by freely sharing her wealth of insider knowledge and hard ball politics commonplace in the lobbying arena of Washington D.C. She walks convincingly towards her non-existent parked car in order to time manage a conversation with Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), president of a small legal practice leading the fight against the powerful gun lobby to enact the Heaton-Harris Amendment which would require background checks on all gun buyers but whom she's mistaken for a Washington Post reporter. She climbs on board as his lobbyist and executes a brilliant plan to pressure an uncommitted congressman to voice his support for the anti-gun legislation in front of a room full of supporters and a cameraman covering the event. In so doing, she betrays the colleague she planted in the audience and hires an actor to pin down the congressman with a controversial question then explains her matter of fact change of plans came about because she anticipated her old boss and Gun Lobby president, George Dupont (Sam Waterson) vetting the audience, learning the real identity of her colleague, and ordering the congressman to avoid her question. Powerful moments like this occur throughout the movie thanks to director John Madden and writer Jonathan Perera not only to convey Elizabeth's formidable mindset but also to fan the audience's credulity so that when she plays her final trump card, the stunning blow is accepted without question.Elizabeth has close, genuine relationships with Jane, Esme, and Rodolfo. She even takes a protective interest in Forde (Jake Lacey), a male prostitute from the agency she frequents although his over the top sleaziness precludes any real romantic involvement. But the choice to cast John Lithgow (""Third Rock from the Sun"", ""Trial and Error"") as the corrupt Congressman Ron M. Sperling debases the film's worth as a political thriller. ""Miss Sloane"" is the story about a true leader and mentor, a woman who ends up in prison and emerges looking for another grand challenge. It is commendable but only rates seven out of ten."

Great plot doing a difficult job of showing more than half the movie in the wrong order. Most of all, I liked that it showed what's it like when you're the genius-level chess player in the room. How odd it feels when people aren't thinking 4 or 5 or 6 steps ahead.Even as the main character proves to be unrelenting and immoral in her approach to winning, you're still rooting for her because Jessica Chastain does an excellent job of showing that she (the character Liz Sloane) does have some feeling regarding what she must do to be an effective lobbyist.)In short, an utter and complete surprise! Movie really felt like the old-school 1970s political/espionage movies like ""Three Days to the Condor"". This was made in 2016 and I don't remember hearing ANYTHING about it! Real shame.

" Not half as smart as it wants to be
",-0.3089,0.9983,2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"""Miss Sloane"" is a French/American English-language movie from 2016 that managed a solid deal of awards attention, including a Golden Globe nomination for lead actress Jessica Chastain. Other known actors in here are probably Waterston, Pill, Lithgow, Baranski, Stuhlbarg and Strong, but eventually the only one it is about is Chastain's character. It is a really long movie at comfortably more than 2 hours and the focus here is on lobbyism in the United States. We follow the battle between two groups and it is all about gun restrictions here. I am not American, so I guess I can give a fairly neutral observation here and honestly I was shocked by how simple and uninspired this film turned out to be. I am sure it is a feast for everybody who supports more gun restrictions, so most liberals/democrats will have a great time watching it. But it is so black-and-white really. The characters with the exception of Chastain's have absolutely no depth at all. We find out about pretty much nobody from the liberal camp except Raw's character, so the focus won't shift away from Chastain. And of course she knows everything, she predicts everything correctly, she is the shining figure for one party etc. It is fairly cringeworthy.On the other side, the opponents, the villains, they are depicted as stubborn old men, stupid, antiquated in their beliefs and really incapable of anything creative. The exception is of course Stuhlbarg's character with his age and they say on some occasions that he is pretty effective in what he does, but when we saw his weak performance at the television debate (nice cameo by Dylan Baker though), it was clear that nobody from the writing staff wanted to make this an equal fight really. Oh yeah and then there is the ending. All predicted by Miss Sloane again too. What the other side would do, what story they would find, how corrupt they would be etc. It is pretty cringeworthy. The big showdown at the court room when she waits a bit until she says she still has something to say before she goes all in on Lithgow's character and of course she is the big winner again, even if she has to go to jail in exchange for her victory. But yeah, they show her leave jail in the very last scene, so they really wanted to make sure we get a happy ending somehow with her in freedom and the old filth in jail. Sigh.This film may seem deep or relevant, but that's really only how the untrained eye perceives it. Neutral observers will be embarrassed by the simple structures, the ridiculous plot lines, the over-the-top unauthentic drama moments (the almost shooting of the Black woman) and then the truly cringeworthy ending. As if the ""spectacular"" revelation about Pill's character wasn't bad enough already, everything that happens afterward is really just the icing on the cake. It is a very rotten cake I would say. The overall outcome of this film was surprisingly bad to me. Only the easily entertained will see this as a good politics thriller. Oscar nominee John Madden (the director of Best Picture winner ""Shakespeare in Love"") did not get me curious here at all about the rest of his body of work and I don't think I have seen a lot from him, if anything at all. But then again he probably isn't even the problem. The huge problem here may be writer Jonathan Perera and it very much shows during these 130 minutes that this is his very first writing credit. I wish they could have gotten somebody better here, then this movie really could have made a difference in my opinion. The cast includes some really talented guys and actors I like quite a lot. But it turned out a missed opportunity as this is so bad at time that I would almost call it liberal propaganda. Closer to one star out of five than to three stars out of five. Highly not recommended."
" Politics exposed
",-0.0772,0.9815,2017-07-24 00:00:00,8,The cast of superb actors first drew me to this story. Jessica Chastain delivers a brilliant performance as a ball busting strong woman who makes no excuses for her desire to win at all costs. She can handle criticism as well as she hands it out. There is no room for personal relationships when the only option is to win. I've long believed that the average American citizen really doesn't hold any weight when it comes to strong issues like gun control. It is owned by the NRA who back the members of congress by donating millions to the right campaign. The gun lobbyist rule the gov't. Why is this so important? I think it's because weapon manufacturers are so wealthy that there is not a more powerful lobby group that can ever change any laws no matter how many innocent people are killed. It's all about the money. Nothing else really matters. John Lithgow & Sam Waterson once again prove their power in their performances. E Christine Baranski shines in her 2 minute cameo appearance. There's no doubt that movies like this one should be watched by all Americans but won't. Once an American chooses his/her political side..that party can do no wrong in their eyes. Politics is similar to religion...born into a mindset & brainwashed to believe that it is the only way that is right. The minions (civilians) are patted on their heads for voting the right way as the smiling senators live a life of luxury that few of their voters could ever dream of living. Until people educate themselves on how the system really works to benefit the rich it will never change. The rich are getting richer on the backs on the poor civilians. The joke is that they don't even know how they are being used to line the pockets of the corrupt.

Her portrayal of gun control advocates as drug addicted, STD ridden, prone to animal cruelty, and bearing a total contempt for the law and the Constitution of the United States of America is easily one of the most accurate portrayals ever documented in cinema. I'm truly shocked that this film was overlooked for the Oscar. If you want to spend the next 2 hours of your life watching a sociopath with literally nothing else going on in her life destroy her career by trampling on your freedoms this is definitely the movie for you!"

" a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity
",0.25,0.7053,2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Directed by John Madden, who has an estimable political-correct streak of making movies with remarkable female roles in the lead, from MRS. BROWN (1997), Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998) to THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL franchise, MISS SLOANE is no exception. The fearless Jessica Chastain stars as our titular American lobbyist, in the opening shot, she directly addresses to us a lobbyist's golden rule with a dead-center fourth-wall-breaking close-up: always to outmaneuver your opponent, and keeping your trump card to have the last laugh, which is exactly what happens in this sleekly choreographed political drama recounts Miss Elizabeth Sloane and her co.'s upward battle of advocating a gun-control bill against her nefarious adversaries. The film starts in medias res, Elizabeth is under questioning at a congressional hearing led by Senator Ronald Sperling (Lithgow), to investigate her possible infringement while she was working in her former company, which currently is fully behind the obstruction of the said bill. Carried with a vibrant but intensely hectic tempo, the plot is dialogue-driven and we are granted a coup d'il of this cut-throat line-of-work of lobbyist, and Elizabeth is the crème-de-la-crème of the crop, but to what cost? She is a prototypical workaholic, a chronic insomniac and inveterately dependent on medication, everyday she dines at the same Chinese restaurant just because it never closes, it goes without saying that she is single and only resorts to escort service to physically de- pressurize herself on a regular basis. Actually the film reveals nothing about her background, her family or her past, virtually she is a working robot, but a hyper-smart one. But that is not to say her working method is not unethical, she is a proficient anticipator, who can plan her moves much in advance, and boy, she takes no prisoners with her. A key pawn is her colleague Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw), who is a survivor of a gun massacre when she was a high-schooler and is still in shell-shock, such a great resource at hand, Elizabeth will not leave that untapped, only its imperilment blindsides her and compels she to rethink her strategy. Jumping back and forth in its time-line, throwing shades at the goings-on plotting to sabotage the beneficial bill (with a self-defeating twist of life being saved from the gun point by a self-armed vigilante, yet why no one pays attention to the gun procured by the delirious killer-to-be? That is the crux in question!), MISS SLOANE prepares us with a consequential trump card which will leave audience both stunned and suspicious, for one thing, it might justify Elizabeth's actions with her over-contrived martyrization, but when one thinks back, it is just not practical because the ""earthquake"" doesn't necessarily need to be timed in that particular moment, Elizabeth can use it more wisely and realistically, to save all the drama and playing dumb all along the line, but as an info-taiment, Madden will not risk to downplay that arousing topsy-turvy uproar. Sensibly, it angles more at the pandemic rotten corruption than its token target of gun control, since after all, it is also monetary interest playing the crucial role in its execution. (the point is never about freedom or right, gun is such a highly profitable business for the country, it boils down to a choice between economy and individual life, and at our own peril, the latter can be regretfully relinquished.) For all its foibles: over-contrivance, one-noted characterization of its antagonists and most supporting roles, there is no denying that Ms. Chastain is all fired up in a tailor-made role and she is absolutely barnstorming and uncompromising in bringing to the fore of a severely flawed human being with flesh and blood, beautifully transfigures the sensation-seeking narrative arc and winds up a full-fledged anatomy of a complex character study with hard-earned credit, this is truly a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity out of her own dedication and faculty, she is such a godsend to the film industry, the fact that she is still waiting for her first naked golden statue is simply beyond belief."

The only reason I wouldn't give this ten out of ten stars is because in a couple of scenes the dialogue between characters is a bit too snappy and contrived, which I found distracting, and the audiovisual aesthetics could have stood mild improvement. Otherwise, the characters and story line are awesome.I love mysteries and thrillers, and knew I wanted to see Miss Sloane from limited previews when I had little idea what it was about. I also give kudos to the directors and producers for not giving away the entire film in the previews. Miss Sloane is a brilliant amoral strategist who sees people as chess pieces within political situations, who bends rules without necessarily breaking them. She cares very little for the niceties and conventions of society and manners, and cares only about principles and winning. Suddenly she develops a strong conviction about a political goal and applies her prior skill set to those ends.With exciting twists and the fantasy control of situations, like a female sort of ""James Bond,"" Miss Sloane almost plays out like an action film rather than a drama. The end is extremely satisfying and worth waiting for.Miss Sloane is about more than just the gun lobby. If you can't see the larger implications you're missing a very intelligent aspect of the film."

I'm rating this movie based on substance and not politics, it's an 8/10 from me."
" A Thriller For Our Time
",0.1027,0.9731,2017-07-13 00:00:00,8,"There's a line in an early episode of Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing where White House chief of staff Leo McGarry (played by the late John Spencer) tells the staff that ""There are two things in the world you never want to let people see how you make 'em: laws and sausages."" Yet the process by which a bill becomes law has proved to be rich ground for writers and filmmakers from Advise & Consent to Aaron Sorkin efforts like The American President and the aforementioned West Wing. More recently, filmmaker John Madden has turned to the lobbying efforts that help make bills law for his film Miss Sloane, starring Jessica Chastain in the title role.It is Chastain's performance that in many ways anchor the film. From the moment the film opens with Chastain looking into the camera and telling the viewer (and, as we discover, her lawyer) that ""Lobbying is about foresight,"" she draws you into this sometimes murky world where morality is a method determined by how far one is willing to go. Chastain portrays Elizabeth Sloane as an intelligent, resilient, powerhouse of a character who is not afraid to say what she thinks and play the game that she sees lobbying as to the hilt. She's also an imperfect character with a host of vices that threaten to be her undoing at times as does the realization that the game she plays might well have stakes she can't accept. There's always a sense at once of both fierce determination and vulnerability to the character that makes Chastain's performance utterly compelling. It is no wonder she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress as her performance alone helps make the film what it is.There's a strong supporting cast as well that reads like a who's who of present acting talent. There are familiar faces in the cast such as Sam Waterston as Sloane's one-time boss turned adversary, Mark Strong as Sloane's new boss who struggles with her methods in spite of hiring her, and the always reliable John Lithgow as the senator at the center of the film's framing device. The film also has strong female roles for its supporting cast as well including Alison Pill as Sloane's assistant Jane and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Slone's confederate who ends up thrust into the spotlight alongside a cameo appearance by Christine Baranski. It's a solid cast all around who nicely back up Chastain's central performance.Beyond the cast, there's a finely made thriller on display. There's a cool, cynical tone to the entire film that is perhaps best emphasized not so much by the script from Jonathan Perera but in the combined efforts of the cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov, the production design of Matthew Davies, and costume choices of Georgina Yarhi. Bright colors, even soft ones for that matter, seem to be a rarity in this world which gives the film a slightly dour, suppressed feel with which the drama is painted across.Drama supplied by screenwriter Perera and director Madden. Miss Sloane fits firmly into the political thriller genre despite, or perhaps even because of its subject matter. Despite its setting in the apparently everyday politics of Washington and Capitol Hill, many familiar tropes are in play. There's blackmail, bribery, threats of violence, manipulation, and even espionage. While the film picks gun control legislation as its subject matter, one feels that its subject matter could be about any number of hot button issues and still be relevant to the here and now of 2017. That is something one suspects both helped and hindered the film as it was released at the tail end of the most bitter American presidential campaign in recent memory where similar issues about a powerful woman in the middle of political circles were part of the state of play. Yet the points it makes, perhaps in something of a preachy manner, in its final scenes are valid ones that will likely continue to haunt Washington and our political discourse for years to come.Whatever the case may be for why audiences didn't see the film in cinemas, Miss Sloane is a thriller for our time that casts a strong, female lobbyist in the role of anti-hero. It takes the current Washington landscape which it turns into a fascinating thriller which examines that sphere of power and the people who occupy it. Audiences didn't find the film in cinemas might find it now that's it on disc and streaming. If they do, they're in for a treat."
" very very good

For those who like public relations story's and backstage media this movie is obligatory. If you watch the movie it becomes obvious why there are some negative reviews. Gun nuts do not like this kind of approach in this critical matter"

I spent much of the movie hating her even as she was fighting for what I believe in. But in the end, I can only admire her. And more than that, I really admire Jessica Chastain who should have received an Academy Award for that performance. It was strong, brutal and very emotional."

I love fast paced action movies, but sometimes I feel, give the heart a rest and engage brain.This movie, ticked this box very firmly. Its clever and quick enough to make you think.. whats next? For one of a very few times, I found I was just going through the movie at the Directors pace, not trying to foresee the next stage.Through good acting and direction, the movie flowed very well, and should you be in the mood for a thought provoking film this should suit you. However, should you have very biased gun views, pro-NRA, then engaging brain could be difficult for you."

It can be a little confusing at first and it's fast paced just as her character, Elizabeth Sloane is. Riveting portrayal of lobbying on Capitol Hill. A bit unfortunate that a gun control law is the focus, because that got NRA members to boycott, even if they knew little about the movie. Otherwise I think the box office total would have been much higher. Because it could have been any bill, the emphasis is on her and her commitment to win. Ms. Chastain is awesome. I truly believe she's up there with Meryl Streep in acting ability. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year."

It really doesn't matter if you want to abolish all guns or not. Her character is a terrible loud mouthed bully. A holier than thou mean girl. But I digress. We're to believe that the world's best mercenary gunslinger wakes up one day and becomes Joan of Arc. It's nonsense and an MSNBC wet dream. And snappy, fast. Really fast. Gilmore Girls fast.

The acting is superb, from the main protagonist all the way to the minor role of the male escort service person. Jessica Chastain deserves an Oscar for her riveting performance.

" Intelligent movie

She decides to lobby on the controversial (in the USA!) issue of gun control. Sloane is used to winning and that is her sole goal with any proposed legislation. Whether people get hurt along the way is irrelevant to Sloane. She treats lobbying like a game of chess whereby you have to predict and counter the oppositions moves. The movie is a bit like a cross between West Wing and Wolf on Wall Street. It's entertaining throughout and whilst something doesn't quite ring true with the main character, well worth a watch."
" Tight and Well Written, Miss Sloane is a Great Showcase for Jessica Chastain
",0.6808,0.9992,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is testifying at a hearing where she's facing charges about her conduct. Her lawyer has advised her to plead the 5th (to avoid incriminating herself). She's a lobbyist but she's far from ordinary. She's the woman among boys in her profession. Her skills of perception, strategy and her will to win are unparalleled and she's not afraid to step on people's toes to get the W. The hearing centres on her business practices during her lobbying efforts to push through a bill restricting access to firearms for people with unstable backgrounds. This process started 7 months ago and the movie flashes back and forth from that time to the present.The subject matter of Miss Sloane breeds intense debate and the movie shows that accurately. I think that's one of the reasons that this movie didn't get seen by as many people that it probably should have. Miss Sloane makes clear which side of the debate their on but they objectively show the arguments for both sides. The movie also dives into the dirtier sides of lobbying. The backroom deals, the two-sided nature of the business, the playing for the cameras and setting up publicity stunts are all addressed and put under the microscope. It reminded me a lot of the tone and style of House of Cards and I mean that as high praise.I'd also like to mention that the plot is very streamlined and the movie moves at a very quick pace. There are small subplots but the movie rarely includes things that aren't going to be important. Remember that while there are scenes that seem like you can duck out to get a snack, this movie requires your full attention to keep up with it. You also gets some top-shelf dialogue and interactions between the characters are interesting and add a lot of personality to the players in Miss Sloane.You have your supporting players in Miss Sloane but this is about Elizabeth Sloane as a character. There's heavy parallels to be drawn between Sloane and Frank Underwood; they both don't have any problem getting their hands dirty, they have ice flowing through their veins when they're in the pressure cooker and even when they're answering to their superiors, they're always in control. It was refreshing to have this character written for a woman and I think this is a good film for feminists. Sloane is a really interesting character, she's despicable (she willingly screws over her friend and co-worker Esme to get ahead) but I never found her boring. I respect the writers for taking this route where she doesn't have to be a hero, she's a different kind of anti-hero and I tend to prefer that kind of character as a protagonist.Jessica Chastain is one of the top 10 A-list actresses working in Hollywood today and I was happy to see her get a vehicle like this. She can do just about anything from action/thrillers (The Debt) to dramedies (The Help). She's great and she nails this role. There's some heavy hitters in the supporting cast; Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, John Lithgow and even Alison Pill. They're all really good, there wasn't a weak link among them and they helped give this movie the professional feel it needed.This is a movie that operates as a tightly wrapped package. It brings you into this world swiftly, it gives you a main character that is impressive to watch despite her faults and throws you into this whirlwind battle without a life jacket. I can see this movie turning off people in favour of easier access to guns (the movie pokes fun at and demonizes the NRA) but I didn't have that problem. I do fall on the side that this movie is clearly on but I think you can enjoy it either way. This movie is a character piece and ultimately a chance for a versatile actress like Chastain to show that she can do a legal-style thriller. She pulls this off effortlessly and it was easy to respect this movie both for it's subject matter and it's top shelf leading performance. Miss Sloane accomplishes exactly what it wants to and I don't think it will be nominated for any awards (Chastain's performance is award worthy in my opinion) or make top 10 lists. Conversely, I still had a great time watching this and I hope more people will get a chance to see it."
" unabashed cynicism
",-0.4019,0.3111,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"John Madden's ""Miss Sloane"" is, quite simply, an exercise in cynicism. The title lobbyist's battle against the gun industry is but a look into the cutthroat world that is US politics. It's a place where nothing gets done without favors (Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" looked at this to a lesser extent).As for the movie itself, it's well done. Jessica Chastain puts on a chilling performance as the main character. Despite her delicate feminine appearance, she's the type who'll stop at nothing to achieve her goals. I liked the performances of most the cast, but I thought that Christine Baranski (best known as Leonard's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"") had an all too brief appearance. Otherwise it's a good movie."
" Intelligent and gripping
",0.4588,0.9735,2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"I really was not sure what I was going to be watching when this movie started. But, to parody another reviewer, she was a hardcore heroine. The corruption of politics was well highlighted and dreadfully appalling. Jessica Chastain...she just seemed to radiate impressive drive, and her character's ability to play the long game was impressive. It made me think, cheer, and just enjoy the ride."
" OK, but...
",0.4466,-0.949,2017-05-23 00:00:00,5,"The movie was OK, but it was a little bit over played to one side. It's no wonder it was such a flop financially; too many gun owners in the country and they don't like to be attacked. Also, they followed a few of the talking points that aren't true, like being able to buy online with an ID: any online purchase is required to be sent to a FFL and they are required to confirm ID when they transfer the firearm."
" Well made but very pedestrian
",0.1406,0.9462,2017-05-21 00:00:00,4,"The story is fine when you watch it, but after the films ""twist ending"" nothing about the story makes sense in retrospect.Chastain is good, though she's very monotonous and that tires quickly. Mark Strong is always good (he seriously deserves more recognition) the rest of the cast are frankly, irrelevant. Jon Lithgow deserves a mention for his portrayal of a bumbling senator falling just short of a full Dick Solomon.In short, the film thinks it's more clever than it is, it fails to surprise and is very predictable. It's an adequate movie if you just want to chill out of an evening, but if you're after something more meaningful, or a political thriller with more guts, look elsewhere."
" A gripping and enthralling political thriller for all lovers of the West Wing
",0.5859,0.9985,2017-05-20 00:00:00,9,"In a roller-coaster year for political intrigue on both sides of the Atlantic, and with all hell breaking loose again between Trump and 'The Hill', here comes ""Miss Sloane"". Jessica Chastain ( ""The Martian"", ""Interstellar"") plays the titular heroine (I use the term loosely): a pill-popping insomniac who is working herself into an early grave as a top-Washington lobbyist. The game of lobbying is, as she describes, staying one step of the competition and ""playing your trump card just after your opponent has played theirs"". But all is not going well for Elizabeth Sloane. For the film opens with her being on trial for corruption in front of a congressional hearing, chaired by Senator Sperling (John Lithgow, ""The Accountant"").Through flashback we see how she got to that point, moving from one firm headed by George Dupont (Sam Waterston, ""The Killing Fields"") to another headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong, ""Kick Ass"", ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") against the backdrop of the high-stakes lobbying around a new gun-control bill. Her fanatical drive to 'win at all costs', and the trail of destruction, through her cutthroat work ethic, that she leaves behind her, digs her an ever-deeper hole as the political and legal net closes in around her.Jessica Chastain has played strong and decisive women before, most notably in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but probably never to this extreme degree. Here she is like Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but not played for laughs. Miss Sloane is an emotionally and physically damaged woman, but a formidable one who takes charge both in the boardroom and in the bedroom, through the unashamed use of male escorts (in the well-muscled form of Jake Lacy, ""Their Finest""). As such her character is not remotely likable, but one the I could certainly relate to from past business dealings I've had. (And no, I don't mean as a male prostitute!) I found Sloane to be one of the more fascinating characters in this year's releases: I was never being sure whether her actions are being powered from a background of strong moral conviction (fuelled by a devastating childhood incident perhaps?) or through pure greed and lust for power. I thought Chastain excelled in the role, but for balance the illustrious Mrs Mann thought she rather overplayed her hand at times.Outside of Chastain's central performance though, this is a very strong ensemble cast. Mark Strong – not with an English accent for once and not playing a heavy – is great as the frustrated boss, as is the seldom-seen Sam Waterston (who, by the way, is the father of Katherine Waterston of current ""Alien: Covenant"" fame). Christine Baranski (so good in ""The Good Wife"" and now ""The Good Fight"") pops up in a cameo as a flinty Senator. But the outstanding turn for me was Oxford-born Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Belle"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" – and yes, I'm aware of the irony in this pairing!). Playing Sloane's colleague Esme Manucharian – both a lady with a secret in her past as well as possessing a great name – Mbatha-Raw is just riveting and deserving of a Supporting Actress nomination in my book.What binds the whole two hours together is an extraordinarily skillful script by debut writer Jonathan Perera, which has both a gripping and ever-twisting story as well as a host of quotable lines. Ladies and gentlemen, we may have a new Aaron Sorkin on the block! It's a brave script, dealing as it does with 2nd amendment issues, since there seems to be nothing that stirs up American comment like gun-control. For those living in the UK (where gun deaths are over 50 times less per capita than in the US) the whole topic is both fascinating and perplexing. The marvelous Cinematography is by Sebastian Blenkov – the second time this gentleman has come to my attention within a month (the first time being ""Their Finest"").The director is Portsmouth-born Brit John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") and he does a great job in sustaining the tension and energy throughout the running time. This all makes it a great shame that the film has not done well at the US box office, perhaps because ( the film was released in December 2016) the public had more than their fill of politics after a bruising and divisive election. (I'm not sure the UK release date now – just before our own General Election – is wise either). But for me, this was a memorable film, and come the end of the year it might well be up there in my top 10 for the year. I'm a sucker for a good political thriller with ""All the President's Men"" and ""Primary Colors"" in my personal list as some of my favourite ever films. If you like those films, ""House of Cards"" or remember fondly TV series like ""The West Wing"" or (for those with even longer memories) ""Washington Behind Closed Doors"" then I would strongly recommend you get out and watch this.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

" An Electrifying Performance by Miss Chastain
",-0.1531,0.9714,2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"The storytelling of the film was all part of a plot by Miss Sloane. We were all directed into confusion just like Miss Sloane's opponents. Genius move. It is all about putting the puzzles together until you realize Miss Sloane has also managed to surprise us.The story began, rather confusingly, into a court case which Miss Sloane was tied into. Flashback to the story prior to the case, Miss Sloane was lobbying for a motion which seems to have nothing to do with the subject of the court case. The script seemed to intentionally make up all these jargon that made the topic difficult to understand. Eventually the pieces started to fit together and all the political debate made sense.Jessica Chastain, again, delivered a strong performance portraying a powerful female protagonist. All the other actors also made formidable performance as supporting characters.The cat and mouse storytelling started off slightly shaky, at times feeling too scripted but managed to make a powerful comeback. A very well told story also reflects the truth of politics. Although the plot seemed too clever to actually happen in real life, the topic certainly is realistic. A true star in storytelling and acting."

",-0.1531,0.9408,2017-05-18 00:00:00,4,"The good: The leading role was given to a woman, which is a major step forward in portraying an alpha female as I know they do exist. A sexy woman in high heels who looks after her appearance and looks sweet and pliable while she's nothing more than a cruel and evil human being more than capable of crushing decent folks with no empathy or real humanity. The characters are given perfect development and space. The bad: the typical predictable turns and twists. The typical predictable Hollywood view of how studios need to comment on political life in the USA with a beautiful lie that all is well that ends well. The script left a lot to be desired, the rapid fire dialog was unrealistic and got annoying, the actors and actresses were delivering their parts as if they were in an informational selling juicers that can juice wood; nobody is going to believe us so let's all exaggerate and hype it up. Apart from Gugu Raw and Mark Strong whose quiet, effortless and natural delivery was a breath of fresh air, everyone else was too loud, too over the top and generally REALLY annoying. The acting was that dreadful the only thing keeping me in my seat was the nachos and cheese. How was I going to walk back home with the magnificent melted cheese on a cold evening? Would I pay to watch it knowing what I know now? No."

Today we play to the Money only and to the lowest common denominator in terms of entertainment. It's such a shame that so many potential customers have not been given a chance to see ""Miss Sloane"" in the Cinema.I rate this as perhaps Jessica Chastain's greatest performance. ""Miss Sloane"" is a great movie. I found it; Fast, Slick, Intelligent, Current and myself completely unable to predict the Plot twists and turns.

" (Fast) Draw Poker

This has, of course, resulted in the film being classed as a flop in the United States when, in countries with a more rational population its merits are fully recognised and appreciated. My abiding memory of Jessica Chastain is of a well-meaning but seriously naïve dork in another fine film, The Help, and now here she is revelling in a role that couldn't be more diametrically opposed and not only that but acting the bejesus out of it. Chastain is only one of a group of stellar performances in one of the best films of 2017."
" A brave movie and a heroine for the ages
",0.7964,0.9307,2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,This movie about a tough as nails female lobbyist fighting against the process to introduce some background checks for firearms purchases. Jessica Chastain is perfect for this role - elegant smart and believable. She never loses your sympathy because her cause is so right. The direction is a little bit rushed - it's hard to follow some of the dialog. The story is hopeful that with a great sacrifice some common sense can finally prevail in this absurd gun situation that we face now. Why wouldn't any one except those who make money from selling guns or those who shouldn't have guns be against proper checks? Some industries shouldn't be in the private sector and driven by profit.
" Miss Sloane is one of the best overlooked films of 2016.
",0.5423,0.9951,2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"Miss Sloane deals with the world of politics and corruption, where stakes are high and money is more important than anything else in the world. Elizabeth Sloane, a formidable lobbyist in D.C. mainly known for her cunning work and successful track record, has been sought after for the Heaton-Harris Bill which revolves around the gun-control legislation. Once she accepts the role, she finds out that she may be against the most powerful opponent of her career, realizing that winning may not come as easy as it seems.Everyone who talks about this film seems to focus on two highlights: the gun control legislation, and Jessica Chastain. I'll start with the latter. Chastain's performance is indeed nuclear, and sadly not addressed by the Academy for at least a nomination. She has plenty of dialogue, and she delivers it with enticing confidence that marks her as a strong female character, in spite of some of her actions throughout the film. This is strengthened by the fantastic screenplay; some of the political jargon did go over my head, but most of what I understood were written well with such snarky wittiness that it's hard not to laugh at parts. This being said, the rest of the cast wasn't bad at all. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Alison Pill were stellar supporting characters, but I wanted to see more from the male side of the cast. This may be a feminist film, with female characters delivering some of the best sentiments, but it would've been better to get a little mix of both.On top of the great performances, there is a worthy plot beneath. This film gives the viewers a fascinating insight into the world of politics, not only tackling the issue of guns in the US, but also with how laws are passed through in the government. This film made me more interested in lobbyists than any other film I've seen with the same role. Furthermore, I love how grey the film deals with the gun control debate. It does not treat guns as neither fully beneficial nor bad, but it looks into the topic with both sides, seeing as how politicians today mainly argue on the pro-gun side of the debate (to only usually appease their viewers to garner more votes). This is a film that mirrors modern society by its issues as well as being a great contrast strengthened by feminism, a strong heroine, and a stellar supporting cast of characters. It can also be seen as a cautionary tale of what's to come, events of the plot eerily imitating what's happening in real life, maybe only with a bit more of unexpected drama.Miss Sloane is terribly one of the best overlooked films of 2016. Jessica Chastain as a lobbyist is electric, her performance magnetic enough to be ceaselessly entertaining, in spite of her dipping in and out of the banal reality of politics at times. It is a very relevant political thriller, and it's sad to see this under-perform at the box office because of the controversial election period this was released in and the poor marketing it has garnered throughout the US. People criticize it since it is openly against gun control, but they might not have watched it because Miss Sloane really is all about the rotten politicians running the Senate today. The gun control debate is just a subplot, the film itself tackling much needed political issues that other films are afraid to venture into. This film has guts. Jessica Chastain has guts. I highly admire them for it."

Robert Forde (Jake Lacy) is her newest male escort. Her latest fight is to stop a tax against Indonesian palm oil.

Esme Manucharian is a young associate who faced death during an earlier gun incident. Elizabeth's former boss George Dupont (Sam Waterston) and former assistant Jane Molloy (Alison Pill) drive to destroy her after getting hired by the pro-gun side. Dupont pressures Senator Sperling (John Lithgow) to chair a committee to prosecute Elizabeth.Chastain is trying too hard. Her character tries too hard. The story tries too hard. The politics try too hard. It starts with her laughing at Sanford. It's so fake and yet she doesn't sell it as fake. It's over the top in a bad way. The politics also feels wrong. The premise is that the rich NRA has bought the congress against their own self-interest. It's politics as envisioned by one side. There are situations popping up through the movie that are too manufactured. I keep thinking some of them are setups. The movie is simply trying too hard.

" Powerful Lobbyist, muddled misinterpretations.
",0.4215,0.953,2017-05-12 00:00:00,6,"This review of Miss Sloane is spoiler free*** (3/5)OBSESSION IS THE key behind any powerful role, an actor will get into the character and portray them so well they turn obsessive. Jessica Chastain is one in particular for taking obsessive roles, in Zero Dark Thirty she played one of main operatives behind the capture of Osama Bin Laden, Crimson Peak's Lucile Marsh was obsessed with getting her own way. Miss Sloane is her most obsessive and most powerful character yet.As Elizabeth Sloane, a powerful, yet formidable lobbyist in D.C she is obsessed with winning, taking in her stride to become the most powerful force in America. She and a small team of cronies are tasked with banning the gun law in women, not taking no for an answer she does anything to win the vote of powerful senates around the D.C area. All characters here want play Bond when they try anything to get the senators votes, this of course goes well in Elizabeth's eyes but to the eyes of others, it doesn't work. Although she does most of the talking, she sends out her most loyal employee, Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw) to do the technical work by talking on TV and providing information about guns, this plan works until Sloane brings Esme's past into the mix, betraying her without sympathy. There's a lot more betrayal along the way, essentially Sloane is like a singularity that sucks in all the sympathy from her peers and doesn't give any back, also she wants to protect women by giving them strength but she doesn't care for feminism, she just wants to win her rights. But when she has to take on the most opponent she's ever faced, she finds winning comes at a higher price. But as unsympathetic as she is, there is charm in her in a compelling moment when she runs a mockery of her court case, the obsession takes its place when she still gets her own way. She's also a challenging character, as far as she is very obsessive, there's heft in her too, she suffers from insomnia and has drugs to get her to sleep at night. And with Chastain's sensational performance everything relatively works well. As compelling as Director John Madden makes it, it's not perfect there are a couple of flaws, the main flaw is the jaunty screenplay, mostly the story writes itself throughout the film, but there are a couple of lines that fail to stick. And all the political and statistical uses it has it's all undone - seemingly dumbed down by its ending. That said, even if you don't like politics or statistics being rammed in your ear, Miss Sloane is thrilling, compelling sometimes challenging and with Chastain's sensational performance there's still something here to enjoy. VERDICT: Chastain is sensational in this compelling lawsuit thriller that packs in a lot of political and statistical heat, which is sadly undone by the dumb final moments."

So many things happen without you being able to follow. I guess that was done deliberately to depict the schizophrenic life these people live, but I just got mentally exhausted trying to figure out who was what, good or bad, what were they doing, where were they, who were they talking with. It all just got too much. I think I mentally checked out half way through.Chastain is terrific, but the story, jeez, just not my cup of tea. Plus you never get enough info to understand what is driving this person, which leave you exiting the movie disappointed.If you want a head spinning flick, with some interesting twists, see this movie, but make sure you are wearing your seat belt."

" Slickly Crafted, But Doesn't Have an Original Style
",-0.3491,0.9423,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"This is a slickly put together film. The cinematography is standard and there is a decent amount of good editing. The writing is acceptable, but it doesn't have its own style. The film is crafted as a Danny Boyle Aaron Sorkin rip off. The film moves at a pace where the dialogue tries to grip you after dialogue with very rapid editing. Everyone's acting game is on top. Jessica Chastain delivers a great performance as always. She was able to turn her likable presence into someone incredibly unlikable. This film has nothing to do with propaganda. It is simply a story that presents how power corrupts the system. She's a lobbyist who is obsess with winning every thing. Somewhere in here could've been a very good political film, but its artistic decision to copy off someone else's work shatters that ladder.6/10."

" Star DC lobbyist takes on the NRA and their political allies with a boutique firm representing the greater public interest.
",0.6705,0.6597,2017-04-26 00:00:00,5,"I am entranced by Jessica Chastain. Imagine, TWO startling redheads at once at the top of the Hollywood star list. I'm also thinking of Amy Adams. But Jessica, That look, that profile, that possession she commands of her roles. I waited for several weeks before Miss Sloane was released to me on Netflix. Now that I have it it justified my admiration for Ms. Chastain, but demolished my expectations for the movie itself as it unfolded.Ms Chastain who solidly ""possesses"" her character from the opening scene, and manifests the sense of purpose, intelligence and indomitability that drives the drama, comes undone at the drop of a colleague's tear, the whisper of an associate's whimper, and transforms her, in spite of our amazement at her collapse, into an hypersensitive, guilt-ridden, hesitant apologetic woman in search of a comforter. The denouement, a scene that insists our protagonist has not entirely yielded to her human weaknesses, came way too late for me."

I gave it 10 to correct those politically biased ratings and will purchase it from Amazon to show my support."

This is a superbly involving and entertaining movie about lobbyist (amazingly played by a great Jessica Chastain) who will stop at nothing to win her most challenging case yet. While i don't believe the ending as in this movie could happen in real life, it was good and entertaining. Performances were very good in this film by also Mark Strong (superb here) and John Lithgow. But the real star is Jessica Chastain who get accompanied here by superbly involving and fast moving script and very solid directing. Overall, at running time 2 hours and 5 min. ""Miss Sloane"" never dragged and was involving from start till the end because of superb script and great performances. While it doesn't go very deep into life of lobbyists nor on a subject of its central case, this is a pure, fun entertainment. Music was also very solid. All in all this is pure fun."
" Brilliantly crafted film that falls victim to its own conceit
",0.4404,0.9954,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"""Miss Sloane"" is excellent in many respects, but deeply flawed in others. The labyrinthine plot is worthy of a spy thriller by a top author of John LeCarré' s caliber, with double-crosses, deceptions, misdirections, subterfuges, and shifting loyalties. Performances are excellent, particularly by Chastain and Strong. Production values are outstanding, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. It's most distracting fault lies in its conceit. The film tries to make a dramatic argument in favor of requiring background checks for all firearm sales. But the arguments presented by the characters seem better suited to a high school debate than a multi-million-dollar lobbying effort. If somebody had asked me, prior to seeing the film, I would have likely responded that background checks don't seem like a bad idea. But watching the film, I wanted to reach through the fourth wall, grab the characters by the shoulders and ask if they were going to let Sloane get away with such sophomoric reasoning. After watching the film, I was much more skeptical about the value and effectiveness of background checks, as well as the integrity of the gun-control lobbyists. At one point, Sloane compares background checks to requiring driver's licenses. But licenses don't keep the idiots off the road or prevent the tens of thousands of traffic deaths each year or prevent people from driving while intoxicated. But the gun lobby guys sat back in stunned silence, as if Sloane had presented such a profound argument that any response was impossible. At several points, the film was not dramatically satisfying because Sloane claimed victories that it didn't feel she had won because her opponents let her walk over them. Perhaps they dummied the film down for mass audiences, but that doesn't make sense, as most of the film is very intelligent and it takes a bit of mental effort to follow and keep track of all the players. Much of the film is smoke and mirrors. Perhaps the actual message concerned corruption in government and the influence of powerful lobbies. But it felt as if the filmmakers were so enamored of the political statement they wanted to make that they didn't feel they had to make it convincing. Chastain's Miss Sloane is a brilliantly complex and multidimensional character. She's dynamic, manipulative, passionate, shrewd, knowledgeable, and yet emotionally hollow, self-centered and abrasive. The arguments she presents in favor of universal background checks seem far too shallow for somebody of her intellect and her commitment to the cause seems quite arbitrary, particularly compared to her chameleon-like approach to whatever issues her clients ask her to represent and her disinterest anything not related to her work."
" Liberal claptrap
",0.0,-0.9201,2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,A terrible movie that deserves to be the flop that it is. Absurd portrayals of the people in the gun lobby with the usual tone deaf liberalism thrown in. I don't understand why Hollywood thinks the American public is incapable of seeing right through their rabid socialism. This movie should be used to soften up prisoners in Gitmo before questioning.
" God help us all

It's one of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it movies full of sharp talking, fast and clever lines. Luverly stuff!There are several is-she-a-good-guy-or-bad-guy moments which keep you guessing till the end (or almost till the end if you've been playing close attention!) which increases tension while exposing the morally corrupt USA election/congress/senate system. Thank god I'm not American!!! You know the country's run and governed by corrupt morons but it's only the odd movie that actually takes it on and lays it it out.What is really funny, hilarious, and downright unbelievable is the fact that there is a 'senate/congressional ethics' committee - surely an oxymoron if ever there was one! For the political statement this makes, it deserves an 11! If anyone thinks that America is run by the people, for the people then god help us all!This is a superb movie, even though most Americans won't see it and, I'm guessing, over half of those who do won't understand what it's about. Which is probably why the world is in the state it's in today. If your IQ is over 50, watch this and ponder on these things."
" Captivated. Watched Sloane twice!
",0.4389,0.8693,2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies where it warrants a second viewing. Hands down it won't disappoint. The sub plot is delivered, a driving point that cuts deep. When a woman's desire to do whatever is required to deliver, her life is precariously out-of-balance, tap dancing a line between success and death.Be wary when a sphinx is challenged. Not all lobbyist are created equal. When Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain, a Hill top gun lobbyist is thwarted by the NRA, she takes push back into the realm of balls to the wall. A David vs. Goliath match ensues. Recast into DC street fight, where Sloane seemingly sacrifices whatever resources become available, leaving no rock 'unmourned' in a scorched Earth death match. What results is a twist you won't see coming. What's left is a resurrection, the proverbial phoenix rises from ash, decimated but born into a new existence. This is one movie you won't want to miss if you loved Argo or American Hustle!The acting is faultless. There are some great lines and moments that permit a deeper understanding although not completely transparent of Sloane's head space. Moments bounce between 'is she playing this person' to 'God, that's cold even for a cause.' One never truly knows where the motivation to stay such a harsh lonely course has evolved, but hey it's a driving point in a story you won't want to end. Not a spoiler but I will say, the last scene allows the viewer to imagine what might occur next...enough that you'll finish Miss Sloane or begin part 2 in your head."

I know. anyway, it ended up on my top 10 favorite films, the plot is 8.5/10 the acting (Jessica's) is a 10/10!, the ending part is truly dope, I really don't understand how Jessica was not nominated for Oscar, like, damn, her acting was flawless.

" An absolute surprise
",0.2732,0.9985,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"I had to say, this movie came out of nowhere in my local cinema today (April 8). I personally wanted to watch this movie rather than Dreamworks's The Boss Baby simply because of the tagline.And boy it delivers.Jessica Chastain plays the title character: a lobbyists who is also a paranoid. She follows an act to against the gun lobby proposed by a senator, backed by her former firm. I have to say, I initially regretted from watching this movie. I even take a break from watching it and go straight to the toilet to wash my tired face, while at the same time asking myself: ""What the heck am I watching right now?"" or ""What brings me into this boredom?"" But I decided to return to the theater and... guess what? I was satisfied in the end, with a big grin on my face.First of all, this is not a political propaganda movie. This is a well constructed political thriller with clever writing, amazing performances and great soundtrack, which happens to use gun policy as a main inspiration. All the cast members deliver a wonderful performance, but it's Jessica Chastain and Mark Strong that really got me. The dialogue in the movie is smart, very rare to be seen in movie these days. The cinematography is amazing, and the editing is one of the best I've seen. The movie cuts between flashbacks and present day, but they didn't disturb the pace, instead it helps progressing the story without it became an annoyance. There were a lot of complex terms that average moviegoer wouldn't understand, but it's forgivable for a movie like this. The movie may also bore average moviegoer for being so slow at the beginning, but it's okay for me. The biggest part for making the movie so satisfying is the plot twist that I've never seen it coming. Just when think it goes this way, the movie makes an unexpected move and goes to a way that you won't expect. And for those who sticking around from the beginning till the end, you will be rewarded with a very satisfying ending. One more thing is that the movie's focus isn't about gun policy, but the corruption that lies within the government. It's the power- hungry officials that drove Sloane into using abnormal ways, to the point where she breaks the rules of the government to reveal the crimes of the government itself. This movie somehow reflects the reality of the governments in present day nations, which is another plus for this underrated masterpiece.I initially gave this movie a 7 for despite the movie being clever, the slow first act and the lack of Sloane's backstory is a letdown to me. But I give it an 8, just because the mind blowing TWIST. Easily to say, this is a movie that you definitely regret to watch at first, but later, when you're leaving the theater, you will definitely feel satisfied. Don't watch this movie if you already had a thought that this movie is a propaganda. Watch this movie, with an open mind, and you'll be rewarded by it.Well played, Miss Sloane. Very well played."
" A gripping thriller of Stiletto power, political corruption, and stopping the gun lobby.
",-0.3612,-0.9223,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Stiletto power, political corruption, and stopping the gun lobby: that sums up Miss Sloane (2016). But like everything in cinema, describing its contents is easy compared to explaining what this film is really about. At one level it loosely belongs to the superwoman genre that inspires shock and awe at what women can do, only this time in the halls of political power. At another it is an exposé of political corruption in which lobbyists game the system that we refer to as democracy.Miss Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a super-smart lobbyist who is ruthless, cunning, untrusting, and will stop at nothing to win her cause. She knows the game of politics inside and out, and is both respected and feared for her win-at-all-costs approach. Her private life is messy: she is an insomniac, a substance abuser, has no friends and hires escorts for late night wind-downs. We meet her answering a Senate Committee about some procedural irregularity, then the story plays in flashback where we see her walking out on her employer because their client, the firearm industry, opposes even the mildest gun-control reform. She takes most of her team with her to a smaller but principled firm that gives her a free hand to win over uncommitted senators in supporting new gun laws. The firearm industry is spending mega-sums of money to block the laws and Miss Sloane. She is also fighting against her former employer and colleagues. They know what she is capable of and it scares them.The storyline is a classic 'femme fatale battles the big boys' except that Miss Sloane is no blushing rose. While she is fluent in both corporate-speak and the language of social-principle, she is an amoral political warrior who waits to see the whites in her opponent's eyes and then strikes for maximum carnage. At this level, the story plays out like a gripping political thriller and Jessica Chastain is brilliant in depicting the twin hydra-headed monster of attractive woman and political assassin. This is not a big-narrative film packed with dramatic action. Rather it is dialogue-rich and viewers will need to be alert for the rapid-fire jargon about the politics of gun control. If you stay with the flow, it is a film full of insight into how single-issue politics can be manipulated by lobbyists who distort the institutional relationship between elected representatives and the law-making process.Some may describe this as a post-feminist celebration of powerful and smart women, others as an endless talking heads fest. There is no doubt that feminism is in the frame because if it was called 'Mr Sloane' then suddenly there is no story. That alone is an indictment of how far we have progressed in the equality domain. If you have ever worked in government or have an interest in the political process, this film is highly engaging; if not, don't bother. It is a tense thriller with several twists and turns, but none greater than its elaborate and contrived finale."

" 'Lobbying is about foresight. About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising counter measures.'
",-0.0772,0.981,2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"This intensely well written (Jonathan Perera making his script writing debut), well directed (John Madden) and well cast film comes at a time when everyone is languishing at the obvious corruption and implosion of the political mess in Washington, DC. Perhaps if more people had seen the film before elections the result of that fiasco may have been avoided. This is an insider view of how our government works – and it is appalling. That response could only be elicited if the forces behind this highly controversial film were of the highest quality – and that is precisely what occurs in this lengthy, disturbing, revealing, and wise film about not only the concept of lobbying (read – buying votes rather than earning them) but also about the agony so widespread in every sector of Washington DC.This film is titled well – MISS SLOANE – because it is about the mind and actions and ferocious commitment to beliefs that one powerful and brilliant lobbyist represents. In the high-stakes world of political power brokers, Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in D.C. Known equally for her cunning and her track record of success, she has always done whatever is required to win. But when she takes on the most powerful opponent of her career, she finds that winning may come at too high a price. The subject is the gun law – requiring registration of all buyers of weapons in an attempt to prevent guns falling into the hands of dangerous people. It is fought as a '2nd amendment right' by the NRA and the pro-gun big bucks lobbyists and bought out senators and congressmen. Liz leaves one lobbying company (leaving behind Allison Pill and Sam Waterston) and joins with Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong) and Esme Manuchurian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and others and eventually must face a Senate investigation lead by the corrupt Senator Sperling (John Lithgow). Along the way the driven Liz uses meds and escorts (Jake Lacy) and her incredible astute mind to bring down the gun lobbyists, but at a price. Jessica Chastain shines in this role and her supporting cast is exceptionally strong. Max Richter's musical score adds tension at the right moments and the cinematography by Sebastian Blenkov keeps pace with this fast moving story. But in the end much credit must be given to the script written astonishingly fine debut writer Jonathan Perera. He is already in a league with Tom Forde and Aaron Sorkin – and that is very high praise. Highly recommended."

This sets off a chain of events that begins with her leaving her agency, lobbying against the gun bill he proposed and ultimately ending up under investigation by the Senate. This is a movie I was excited about because I am huge into politics and love seeing how things work. This movie really had shades of House of Cards in the way that the main character is someone that seemingly plays everyone off each other for her own benefit. The movie does seem to move slowly in a few parts, but at the same time it seems deliberate and allows the events to sink in. This is one of those movies where the ending really makes the movie and rewards you for sticking through the slower parts. Overall, a movie that shows the (I assume) real side of lobbying. Chastain is great in this and I really enjoyed this quite a bit I do recommend this but this isn't a movie for everyone. If you liked Ides of March or Our Brand Is Crisis you will most likely enjoy this one as well. I give this a B+."

The perfect blending of present time and flash backs never got into annoying mode, in fact those were so timely that I felt I almost expected that piece of story from that point of time. The characterization of Miss Sloane by Jessica Chastain is so believable that we drift with the unpredictability of the character who is also so determined to get what she aims for. What I missed a little, may be a touch of her childhood, what made her what she is today. The writer , director anticipated this and played with a different angle, so in the story also she keeps on telling others why does she need to have a sad story to support for a cause is also believable. Mark Strong and other actors did justice to their characters, so did the script writer and the director. The twists in the story lines are comparable with some of Frederick Foresyth's best short stories. All in all, a must watch for all lovers of political thriller."

The movie was not solely focused on it at all; it emphasized on being one step ahead of your opponents to win.Title of my review says it all. It deserves all the success it can get."
" Awesome
",0.6249,0.9922,2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome. One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Very strong emotionally. The performances are top notch; all of them. But In my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved at least an ""actress in a leading role"" nomination. She achieves a better performance level than Natalie Portman - ""jackie"", Isabelle Huppert - Elle"" or even the winner - Emma Stone in ""La La Land"". Again, my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict. It's absolutely astonishing. Loved it."
" Point and shoot
",-0.34,0.9079,2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Miss Sloane is a long film about government lobbying whose second half is better than its first half.Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) upsets her bosses when she turns down the gun lobby and jumps ship to a rival firm who is supporting a bill to expand background checks for gun purchases.Her actions causes a split between her team, some of whom go with her to the new firm and those who decide to stay behind. Sloane is driven and smart. She anticipates what might be thrown at her as her group attempts to get senate support for the bill.The film has a dual narrative as it starts with a senate investigation looking to misconduct in her part which we return to as the film progresses.Jessica Chastain gives a strong performance as Miss Sloane, tough as nails and someone who is prepared to trample on her colleagues. She will do whatever it takes as a lobbyist to succeed.The film has a long running time and it starts off rather sludgedly like it is another film about political lobbyists and the games they play but it gets more fascinating as it goes on."
" One of 2016 best movies ignored by public and academies
",0.4404,0.3453,2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,I originally ignored Ms Sloane because I believe was another of those courtroom movies with heroic characters that are not at all like the money starving and lazy lawyers I know. I pick up interest when I found out it was about Lobbyist (a profession very few people know about but is well know that control politics). Miss Sloan was one of those pleasant (and obviously sad) surprises because pretty much reflect the reality of USA politics during the last year; with a Congress controlled by Republicans and with everybody trying to stay afloat and blame everybody else with the recent crisis. Miss Sloane is a combination of the best of Michael Clayton and the unexpected twist of THE STING; however this time focused on politics. Jessica Chastain has an special ability to act like a bitch so she is only perfect for the character. I cannot imagine any other actress doing this so well and the movie would never work with a male character.The underline theme is basically the fight for stronger weapons selling controls. Something we know is almost impossible to get with a powerful and deep pocketed lobbyists but the movie dares to go there and explain us perfectly well the level of corruption in government and elected officials.Why Miss Sloan failed at he box office like Ang Lee 's Billy Lynn Longs Halftime can only be justified on the sad fact that American public prefers to ignore those things that show realistically the moral corruption in our Country. What is even worse is that critics basically kill both movies. Why was that ? The Arms dealer lobbyist also ?In brief; please invest in this movie your time and money because these movies has to be made in order for us to become more educated

Acting and character building is one of the best I have seen in a long time. If you are the type of user who likes brainless action disguised in seemingly ""serious politics and FBI troubles"" than this movie is not for you - it is for serious viewers who understand politics and know how constitution works. This would also explain why this movie has a lower rating than it should - simply because it is not for an average user that likes movies like ""Allied"" or ""Manchurian Candidate"" or TV shows like ""Blacklist"". If you want an intelligent depiction and struggle of fighting against big corporation - it is a must watch! It also shows both sides of the story, it is obviously biased towards bad guys but you end up kind of seeing it from their point of view as well. All in all, great movie, highly recommended."

" This is Not a Pro-Gun Control Movie, you ignorant fools!
",-0.68,0.9453,2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"Instead of deciding for myself, I believed all the negative hype and shitstorm about this movie...I should be ashamed of thinking that people saw the movie and gave constructive criticism. How many of those haters have actually watched this movie?? This movie is so frustratingly underrated. It was even only screened in the US. Why is John Madden not nominated/awarded for his directing?This movie shows two sides: Pro and Contra of gun control. The movie is about lobbying and how some politicians (senators)can be lead by money and power without giving a damn about their country, the people, and their safety. Jessica Chastain gives a masterclass in acting. She is almost in every frame and totally owns every scene she is in. Her performance is again so powerful, thrilling and enigmatic. I really can't understand why she was not nominated for an Oscar, as she had so many lines to speak rapidly and fiercely. Her character does everything to win by eliminating every grain of morality and compassion. It is up to the viewer to find her likable or not. Or to relate to her. She is not one-dimensional and shows many layers of herself. I also loved ""The Debt"", again directed by Madden and starring Chastain. They are certainly a great duo. Mark Strong should also be mentioned, the great actor who seems to be cruelly underrated in every movie he is in. The question is, why? Not young, no six-pack, bald, not American? I just wish that such powerful movies with a great objective message should not be ignored and forgotten. While actresses like Natalie Portman were nominated for an Oscar, for an unauthentic, cold and forced performance, Amy Adams for Arrival and Chastain for Miss Sloane remained neglected and unrewarded."

How anybody in their right mind can score it a 1/10 is either working for the gun lobby or still has their mother to feed them. The acting is sharp, sound and cinema photography is exquisite and story is only slightly far fetched in that anything resembling this bill would ever get passed in the home of the right to bear semi automatic weapons to hunt rabbits!! It is an easy 8/10 to score and Jessica Chastain was outstanding and really wore the character well."

" Tight Screenplay, Sharp Acting - Must watch!
",0.0,0.9823,2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Anarchy is a compulsion to achieve a state of supremacy at all costs, but winners are not anarchists. They are smart disciples of life, as it is a game of existence that we play on a daily basis. This movie brings out this very fact in a beautifully bound script, talking of ethics and normalcy in life, all at the same time. The fact of the matter is that we are deluded in our thoughts and delusion always leads to a programmed destruction of our existence. In short, even if we do, we barely make it. Miss Elizabeth Sloan was just the opposite of such a way of life, but the surrealism of reality (If I can context such a possibility, without being incorrect) has her working in a light of normalcy we are all familiar with at all facets of life. The good part about this feature is that the angles of the sub-plots are layered and climactic in nature, which required great work in editing and direction. It was done just right in that perspective. There are abrupt flaws in continuum and characterization in very small quantities, but overall, the tendency to have a theme resolute in the final climax of a feature requires art and hardly we get it right. Spotlight, the movie, is one such example of linear execution of theme and idea. A craft which is mastered by very few in terms of screenplay and execution, but John Madden did it right. The only flaw I saw in the movie was the complex inclusion of sub-plots with a lot of information. This was a little difficult to follow, specially by viewers who are not well informed. John Madden has a surreal touch to his screenplay, in all his movies. I would say, he tried very hard to keep it as grounded as possible. The part I don't understand is that the story and screenplay were beautifully executed for cinematic excellence and there was a strong point being made. Thus the low critic ratings and the lack of performance nominations is just beyond me.Watch it and you will understand, what I meant.Score: Story: 8 / 10 Screenplay: 8 / 10 Acting Prowess: 7.5 / 10 Overall: 7.8 / 10"

Like spying and putting operatives. The operatives would also feel the heat and lose careers. Not realistic in sense of acts but certainly good when we consider the purpose of movie : to indicate how an industry operates and influences decision making affecting a nation. Also, the fact about medication taken by lead actress is not taken seriously into the movie. That lone factor can evaporate strengths of an individual."

I am talking about the motives human beings are driven to do what they do. The fact that we are not in control of our own lives despite even we may be control freak. That, I think, is the core of the story.John Madden did it again. After a sublime 'Shakespeare in Love' and a charming 'The Exotic Marigold Hotel', he delights us again with this masterpiece—time will tell.If you are truly a film lover —and you are not happy enough with Iñárritu's tricks— don't miss it.Yes, it is politically incorrect.

Proof of this is the undeserved high number of 1 or 2 scores given to the movie along with biased reviews. No movie gets scores as low as this on IMDb, even absolute stinkers get better scores.I recommend you give it a watch and persist with it until the very end. It's a dialogue driven story and lacks much in the way of real action but the characters are totally believable, the acting is first class and I assure you that will become thoroughly immersed in the story. So choose to ignore the blatant biased reviews and you'll be amply rewarded. Easily one of the best films of 2016.This is a MUST SEE movie!"

" Miss Sloane (2016)
",-0.1531,0.9942,2017-03-09 00:00:00,6,"My endearing love for Jessica Chastain means I will watch absolutely anything she is in to see the red headed goddess captivate me with her beauty. I think she's a fine actress (in her beauty and her acting ability). This film flew a bit under the radar in 2016; it seemed like something that was meant to make a few waves during award season but having seen it now, there wasn't too much to rave about. However, one thing cannot be denied, Chastain is a force to be reckoned with.Miss Sloane is about a lobbyist, and her dedication and unnerved attitude towards her job. The film explores her resolve and how it interferes with her free time and life, while also displaying what a powerful and unwavering lobbyist she is. The film also explores betrayal, the cutthroat business that she is in, and also some of the scandal involved in politics. The film is a political thriller. A lot of the film uses terminology that may really isolate a casual viewer. You have to really know what you are getting yourself into. Its not always entertaining and often feels like information is being thrown at you without really attempting to engage or motivate the viewer.I think the film is watchable due to Jessica Chastain being a powerhouse in this. Her character may not resonate with all viewers but its hard to deny the conviction with which she portrays Elizabeth Sloane. Its one of her strongest performances to date. She really disappears into her character and her character has some serious balls (for a lack of better terminology). I wouldn't have been surprised with a best actress nod at the Oscars for her super performance. She really saves the film from really fading away into obscurity.Chastain is brilliant, and the supporting cast do well to work a film that has too much political jargon to set itself out on its own feet. There are some really fantastic scenes where the emotion really hits out and it escapes its textbook style verbosity. Its a shame it doesn't happen more often. In conclusion, this film won't be for everyone. If politically driven films are your thing you would have a better judgment on how this film stands up to others of a similar nature. For me it wasn't very special.6/10"

I enjoyed every episode of ""House of Cards"" even though I can't say I understood exactly what was going on 100% of the time. So many movies involving politics leave me wishing I had paid more attention in my American Government class in college.One thing I love about this film is that is easy to follow. Some awesome plot twists, shocking surprises and incredibly intense moments, but so well done that the viewer never feels perplexed or needs to rewind in an attempt to figure out what the heck is going on.I liked the entire film, from beginning to end.

This film is all about the law, but Miss Sloane is all about herself. She is a powerful lobbyist, and the director does a good job of walking the line between making you love and hate the protagonist. Les was afraid that this would be a film adaptation of the television series, ""Scandal,"" but he was relieved to see a refreshing character study. The supporting cast and direction of the film helped to reinforce the wonderful performance by Chastain. The only complaint or ""trigger"" warning they had, is that Sloane advocates for gun control, which might offend some people. They suggest that viewers overlook this, because this film really hits the target.

At first, her acting doesn't seem as convincing as it does later, and therefore the story suffers a bit. But that is forgotten as the story evolves and we learn more about the hard- shelled person Miss Sloane is but yet so vulnerable and alone. But as she grew, the story became more sufficient and exciting. What we learn from the character is the thin line between professional outcome and your fellow man – how far can one go without trespassing? It's an insight of the work behind the scenes of the political world. Miss Sloane does everything to win, ordering surveillance of her coworkers and opponents – unlawful, but yet determined. She is well prepared and that is what makes the subliminal message in this film more convincing. It's also very surprising with unexpected events with a clever and great script. Magnificent whistle blowing and the hidden message says it all. Definitely a 8/10 and a must watch."
" Excellent film and a command performance by Jessica Chastain
",0.5719,0.9738,2017-02-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie should have received at least as much Oscar buzz as ANY other from 2016. A very engaging and captivating film almost from the start. The performance by Jessica Chastain is worthy of many more starring roles, hopefully in the very near future. I have a feeling as to why it didn't do well at the box office, but pay no attention to the negative reviews and one way or the other leaning critics. I'm a believer that a good film is a good film, no matter the supposed ""agenda"". When you sit down to watch a movie, the filmmaker and the actors only have a couple of jobs, which can vary depending upon the genre. If it's a comedy, the only real job is to make you laugh. If it's action, they need to blow up stuff in as logical a way that can be conceived in an action film. And if it's a drama, as we have here, lead with great story telling and excellent performances. If they make you think at the same time, that's just icing on the cake. Miss Sloane is a drama that checks all of those boxes and qualifies as an amazing film."
" Film Review: Miss Sloane
",-0.1531,0.9977,2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"If you haven't figured it out already, The Newsroom, the cancelled and highly underwetched, underrated, and heavily missed HBO Dramatic series from the ingenious Aaron Sorkin is absolutely one of my all-time favourite television shows ever created. Given the quip dialogue, snappy political, social and cultural references, not to miss, its absolutely miraculous comedic timing and concurrent content, it is not only one of the best shows to ever premiere on television, but also a necessary viewing. Now if you're thinking, why in the heck am I mentioning a television show that has nothing to do with the current movie in review, the answer iseverything!Miss Sloane may have been made by any of the talent who brought to life The Newsroom, but add the inclusion of two of the major actors in the show, plus a very apparent and suspicious comparison in delivery of dialogue, and mix all that with one of the best satirical and comedic lobbyist films in Thank You for Smoking, Miss Sloane is a lobbyist film that falls short in over two hours of misconstrued, flashy, politically polished and governmentally red-taped dialogue that not only keeps audience members at bay for the majority of the conversations between characters, but really only keeps the hopes for viewers that the final scenes and pivotal and totally expecting twists by the films end, are so worth this long-gestated and over-winded drama.The story is simple; Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is the most sought after and ambitious lobbyist in D.C. Set against a world of high-stakes power-brokers, government officials and corrupt businessmen, Miss Sloane is up against her toughest opponent when she's pitted against the heavily armed and lucratively funded arms industry of the United States of America. Leaving her own firm to join forces with a once formidable opponent Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), Miss Sloane must learn to trust people and others if she wishes to win one of the biggest cases of her life, which is something she is completely unfamiliar with. Upon learning of Miss Sloane's departure from her current firm, Sloane is surprised in finding that not all alliances are what they seem to be, including her right-hand ally Jane Molloy (Alison Pill), who abandons Sloane and partners up with her opposition. Left with a handful of strangers and new faces, Sloane must learn to work with others or suffer the consequences of taking on too much and inevitably finding her demise to the all-too-powerful United States government and its ties to the very powerful corrupt arms organization.While many films this year have the gracious feeling of being heavily scripted and quite theatrical, Fences and Una for example, the overtly scripted Miss Sloane has its characters reciting lines throughout the film rather than delivering them, especially since the film relies heavily on courtroom jargon that mostly takes the audience away from the story. With the exception of Jessica Chastain, who seems to relish in the highly convoluted word-play of screenwriter Jonathan Perera's debut script, Chastain elevates to a singular level of performance and acting in Miss Sloane. It is safe and easy to say that Chastain is the singular character who carries her dialogue, the narrative and flow of the film effortlessly, while each and every actor in the film seems to be playing catch-up.While Miss Sloane can easily be judged as a political thriller, the thrilling aspects in the film rely heavily on action/reaction shots of the highly unexpected revelations of its supporting characters. Foresight and overshadowing certain, very touchy, issues dealing with sexual abuse, violence and emotional tragedy, seems to keep Miss Sloane afloat for the majority of its runtime, although, the high anticipation of the verbal sword fighting between characters acts more like cinematic action pieces than narrative adrenaline, something The Newsroom does without trying.As the stress along with the cat-and-mouse games between Sloane and her adversaries unfolds, many questions arise, that are rarely answered, which is frustrating for a viewer. More than anything, one of the most aggravating aspects of Miss Sloane is a lack of empathy or history behind the protagonist's main ambitions. Sloane, a woman who shares nothing with her peers and amongst her employees, shares a very routine life that sees her eating at the same restaurant each and every night, while her main emotional connection/release is burdened to a very inquisitive and highly curious male escort named Forde (Jake Lacy). The interactions between Forde and Sloane are amongst the best in the film, easily giving audiences a mild understanding of Sloane's psyche, even when audiences question whether or not a high-stakes lobbyist would actually share such delicate and classified information with, essentially, a high end male prostitute.As the screw turns slowly on this story of deceit and manipulation, it becomes clear that anyone and anyone is a pawn in the very damaging game Miss Sloane is playing. Cutting off relationships, friendships and people with the blink of an eye, Chastain's portrayal of an emotionally damaged and voided social individual is quite spot on. Closing in on resourceful counter-measures, Miss Sloane is constantly questioning her moral and ethical means to winning, while many of the supporting characters, most notably, Rodolfo, bring Elizabeth back to Earth, and ground her intentions of winning and the many choices she make to appear and come out victorious.While professions and government professionals are questioned, surprised and many times, reduced to nothing, Miss Sloane relies heavily on its conclusion and final scenes, to surprise audiences with unbelievable revelations about characters that not only give the film immunity but the time the closing credits roll along, but also make the unbelievable, believable."
" Don't take the rating too serious
",-0.0772,0.8805,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I went to the cinema to watch the movie, expecting an average 6- rating-work. However, as I was leaving the room, I believed I've seen, at least, an 8.0 rating-movie.The movie starts quite slowly building its plot, as we witness the professional life of Miss Sloane, a self-centered woman who totally neglects her personal life, aiming for ""greater goals"". We understand she is a complex human being, who uses all means necessary for a win at court.However, as the movie continues, we start to get really attracted to the plot, with some twists and tense moments. The end is exactly what I expected: a climax, a mix of emotions and the only time we see Sloane's sentimental side.I highly recommend this movie for a Saturday night: not Oscar- worthy, but definitely good."
" Just don't go with its rating
",0.0,0.9977,2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"It has definitely secured the position of one of the best films of 2016.i was completely in a shock after watching it. i was watching it without a shred of an expectation. but oh my goodness jessica chastain has broke every bit of doubt i had in my mind be. the way she debates, the way she expresses herself, the way she easily confesses how far she can go for her career is AMAZING. i love her character. how she obsessed with winning, how she is compulsive with her career, everything.. i was so blown away by the movie. i mean wow miss sloane is definitely a must watch for those who might be looking for something good. it basically a dialogue based movie so some people might find it boring but i would say. it can hit you by some powerful words. it can touch you by the truth. everything was more than perfect. jessica's acting was worth watching. she did a splendid job being miss sloane. i loved it all the way. story was strong acting was strng presentation was strong and there is a big strong suspenseful ending. so what you want more from a movie. and its good to have watching this kind of movies every once in a while :)"
" Slow to start, but picks up the pace. Interesting story with good performances
",0.8126,0.7208,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It is clear from reading other reviews that this film has upset some of the NRA gun lobby people. Despite the narrative that runs through the film, about ""control"" not meaning, ""the lefties are coming to take your guns"". Clearly many of these people slating the movie have not even bothered to watch it. In my mind the film promotes common sense and suggests the petulant bickering of both sides to be nothing more than political jousting, rather than genuine concerns about rights or safety.The film itself has many positive performances, it is well shot, and despite a slow start. The story picks up pace to a superbly crafted ending. The leading lady is an intimidating hard faced lady, who will be attractive to some, but perhaps not to all. That said any movie where the leading character is not easily likable, can be refreshingly interesting."
" Maybe not for 10, but certainly it's above 7.
",0.4767,0.9897,2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Just watched the movie and I have to say I'm shocked that it's rated so low on IMDb, as I have watched much, MUCH worse movies with better ratings. Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one, whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience watching it for an European audience, as from the start second amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however, although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even expect other side to be equally represented? Strongly recommend to give this movie attention it deserves."

How do you want the youth to connect if you keep telling them that love ain't the sh*t?? It is a recurrent theme in 21st century cinema that i condemn, because it perpetuates mechanic sex--humans deprived from feelings.

" Worth an easy 8/10 - Pro gun folk are manipulating it
",-0.0258,0.9725,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"So many users are getting their knickers in a twist. They are giving this excellent movie with great twists a low rating because the story is about gun law, and sides with, yes you guessed it, anti gun lobbyists. All the 1/10s own a gun lol.It's actually not about gun law at all. Gun law has only been used as the subject of the day, to put the point across about dirty politicians and lobbyists.This movie is terrific. It's complicated at the start, but soon starts to make sense.The main character is terrific. Cold, hard and calculating. Great job!I can't say anymore because I never include spoilers. Just trust me.Whether you're for or against guns, that's not the point. This is a political thriller folks. Sit back, relax and enjoy it!BTW....it's not a true story. Don't take it so seriously.8/10"
" From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the tangled mess that is US politics.
",-0.3612,0.879,2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the tangled mess that is US politics. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is unrivaled. The genius who designed the plot of this movie deserves a whole host of accolades for them personally. Twists and turns around every corner making it engaging on a level similar to that experienced when deconstructing a Shakespeare play. This movie is for anyone who desires not only a piece of quality entertainment but also something that stretches their intellect. Aside perhaps from the role of Tony Stark I have never encountered a more badass main character.
" Great movie, Outstanding performance by Jessica Chastain!
",0.8553,0.976,2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"This is a powerful female driven film about the title character and politics. It's one of Jessica's best performances if not the best. This character allows her to show so many things of her skill set. She's so believable, every nuance, every line she delivers is just so perfect. She should have been nominated for this role for every award show...Miss Sloane is a great movie which has a very fast pace. You can't predict what's coming next, great performances by everyone on the cast.Forget about the bad reviews, even if you don't like politics this movie will keep you interested. It's upsetting that It bombed at the box office. I think It's because of the subject matter and people might had enough of the political climate in real life. But It really deserves to be seen. I highly recommend this awesome, very underrated movie."
" Zero Blank Nerdy
",-0.0516,0.9908,2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I won't go into the matter of pro- or contra-gun-control - ofc both sides will have their special point of view on Miss Sloane. I rated the flick 4 - despite of Jessica Chastain being one of my favorite actresses (Zero Dark Thiry, Interstellar, Crimson Peak etc.).The most trouble I got with this movie is - the dramaturgy. The actors are doing their job very well but tbh the whole movie (taking the issues of guns aside) is more kind of a social group study of a certain cast of ppl (politicians, media, spin-doctors, p.r.-ppl etc. - but as I am not in that kind of ppl involved I cannot determine how accurate the depiction is) as a drama. I wasn't involved into the characters nor in the ""issues"" but I watched the movie mostly with a feel of indifference, getting sleepy trying to follow all the endless dialogues and conference meetings and somehow stereotypical characters depicted, but I confess, at least I had the chance to admire the beauty of Chastain.So what's wrong!? In my humble view Miss Sloane mostly misses suspense, it's easy to see if someone compares the movie with the master-class of this genre - the screen adaptions of Grisham's books a la A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker and Runaway Jury etc., or lets say with political movies a la All the President's Men (Redford, Hoffman) - suspense!? Thrill!? Nada. All over characters who act and think like public opinion is some gameplay or ego-game - so the movie may reveal some truth about political bizz but it does in a rather boring way.Miss Sloane is kind of a educational movie and or description of how ppl and mechanisms in (may) Washington work and a monument for the eternal beauty of Jessica Chastain. And ofc some anti-gun-propaganda.So if you want to be involved into the political business in Washington or other places I can recommend this movie as a kind of teaching class for you, the aspiring next Emperor Ming, but if you want suspense and thrill and entertainment like I do, and even the real Armageddon, if not well executed, just gets a little arched eyebrow from you and you won't bother to get up from your coach, I just can't."
" Just look a great book - impossible to put down!

" great movie
",0.6249,-0.8988,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"i can tell that the gun lobby is also active on IMDb. this movie is straight told with unexpected moves. it is realistic as well as true. but in a world of alternative facts difficult to accept. it goes on too long far too long.. it has to stop here and today. the connection with the gun lobby and the senate is authentic. the characters are real. what i liked most of all was the fact that everyone is selling out anyone except the call-boy. in this world of business and in the world of politics , the decent one is the one who sells his body. while everybody would kill for their ego or for wealth.. he remains sincere and surreal . the whore is the only person with ethics and value is messed up world is quite a message, although it had little to do with the main story... again i feel disgusted by the reviews who have nothing to do with the movie but a lot with their political views... the reviews prove this movie is true!"
" Movies staring women are not promoted
",-0.3252,-0.3838,2017-01-25 00:00:00,9,"This is the first big movie about lobbiests I've come across. Jessica Chastain plays a tough part but unfortunately her personality isn't examined in depth during the 2 hours. The film explores the ways men are treated differently from women. For example she hires a male escort and while men would overlook this in a male lobbyist ('cos it would be far from the worst thing they do), for a woman it would end her socially. The escort is the perfect combination of sleazy and possibly entertaining.I don't imagine the notion that background checks before the purchase of a firearm is a seriously debatable point and so the film doesn't get into some pointless debate. Perhaps the proposed 'Registry of Muslims' is to allow crazy WASP's buy a surface to air missile but prevent sane Muslims from buying a 22.This movie was under promoted, like most films staring women. If you look at the posters for 'Arrival' you'll see that the female star got the same billing as her male co-stars who have a fraction of the lines.This was a movie about a strong woman, not unwilling to be disliked by men. Its funny at the start when the NRA man who thinks women are best spending time in the kitchen, is nervous about meeting her. He doesn't know if he should shake hands with a woman in the business world.Political movies where good triumphs (such as 'The Ides of March') didn't don't get much support despite the great cast and script. Instead tragic films like the new 'King Kong' or the recently lame 'Jurassic Park'offering are the only things in the cinema.My totally biased opinion is that some stupid men (like the committee Ms Chastain refers to) make choices about movies. They make testosterone fueled choices and go for expensive pointless non- scripts like 'Gods of Egypt' instead of low budget films that have a genuine script.Obviously - I'm with Her!"

Chastain does it as well as any women so far. very convincing, and she proves once again, any role she does, she does better than most, if not all-just like her screen character in this flic-Miss Sloane. The cast is superb, I would only second guess using the ""tried and true ""ie-over done/stereotype actors, and you know who I mean!!Lastly- I would have had a certain someone {Mr. Ford} waiting for Miss Sloane when the curtain closes.Her blank stare-as if startled..BEGS for something!!! Or...is the somewhat startled and surprised gaze...a GUNMAN..outraged by her triumph over the gun Lovers she so brilliantly foiled ?? Maybe a sequel ?? What do you say ?"

Unaware of the economic and political inner games of America, the movie felt too dragging for me. This could be of the best movies that in my top list.The performance of the actors and character formation was wonderful. Especially the protagonist. Her heroic performance at the end of the movie bagged big applause in the theater.The movie is a worth watch, but not highly recommended from my side.#KiduMovie"

As a person who's a magazine editor and former English teacher, I can spot phony writing a mile away (as when a college basketball star had his girlfriend write an essay because he wasn't a bright student), and many of these diatribes are from a boilerplate. Different people may have sent them, but it's obviously they were working from a set text. Shame on them and their ignorance. Shame on IMDb for printing diatribes rather than critiques of this film. In all honesty, I rated it 5 because one must enter something in order to print a review, but I didn't see the film. Nor did most of these comments help me decide!"
