" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.948,2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,I couldn't even get past the first 20 minutes of this movie without wanting to scratch my eyes out because the character design is so disgusting and unsettling to look at I'm all for unique and creative animation but these characters are just downright ugly the plot is horrible and bland and the characters besides being terrible to look at have no real personality this is just a cheap horrible movie that plays off of a beautiful holiday and culture if you want to watch a movie about this topic watch coco or something else this movies horrible
" Stolen... but Golden
",0.0,0.9801,2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"From speculation at its release, this appears to be a changed story from Coco. But I'll forgive it. Great cast, good soundtrack and sound design, stunning scenes. Good show for any family, and good storytelling, definitely some cheesy elements(for the kids) but that wouldn't change that I love this everytime I watch it. Good show."
" Fantastic storytelling
",0.5574,0.8786,2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,I don't know why it seems this movie wasn't more popular when it came out! The story and characters and it's message overall speaks to the heart and strikes adventure and courage in the mind! I loved it and my kids loved it!
" Disney wishes!! Phenomenal 3d animated bluray!! Excellent!!
",0.7556,0.9934,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Everything about this beautiful animated movie is excellent especially the great story. It's a love story, its a story about friendship, courage, honesty, it has it all. The voice talent was second to none. Really can't find a flaw, even the 3d was excellent. I'm extremely happy I purchased this great 3d bluray , we all know there is a lot of 3d and animation movies in general that are terrible. This is right up there with pixar as a matter of fact I liked this better than coco!!!!"
" In my opinion
",0.0,0.6369,2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,This movie is better when it comes to discussing the Mexican tradition of celebrating the day of the dead I'd say it did a better job the Pixar's movie 'Coco'.

" Great Animation Style But Poorly Written Plot
",0.3716,0.9345,2020-11-10 00:00:00,6,"The Book of Life showcases a really different style of animation and the characters are very well designed. But thats where the good ends, the plot is very generic, dialogs are poorly written, the songs feel more like bad pop songs than authentic mexican music. Nothing really for adults to enjoy, kids will love all the colors I guess."
" Super cute annual watch
",0.7845,0.9848,2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I watch this movie at least once a year. It's adorable. I have a bias toward music, so I love that whole aspect of Manolo's character. It's not super deep or anything and has some childish jokes, but it's a fun watch for an evening where you just want a cute heartfelt story. I love the stylistic animation and the whole design of the land of the remembered. One of my favourite ""sit back and chill"" movies. I say, give it a go. Definitedly good for kids."
" ""Always review from the heart""
",0.0,0.9662,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"The Book of Life is a well put together animated family flick that provides creativity and morality throughout. The story is quite entertaining from beginning to end with the many characters we follow from leading man Manolo, to tough guy Joaquin, to resilient Maria. The animation is some of the best I've seen in the decade showing the festive world that is the Land of the Dead. Coupled with catchy, memorable songs, awesome action sequences, and a satisfying ending, and you got yourself another movie to watch on Dia de Los Muertos that is not Coco. Seriously if it wasn't for this film, Pixar wouldn't have even thought to make Coco in the first place. If you haven't watched it, do yourselves a favor, it's worth the watch."
" Sneaky good kids movie
",0.25,0.9769,2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,For whatever reason we watched this in a college class I had? Still no idea why.... but I really enjoyed it and bought it for like $2 so my niece could watch it. Honestly it's pretty cute and funny for anyone I feel like... one of those kids movies that actually isn't completely unbearable for adults

" A true under-appreciated classic
",0.4215,0.981,2020-08-13 00:00:00,10,"A simple story of rivalry for the hand of a strong willed young woman between two friends - with a supernatural twist. The craft in storytelling, pacing, the use of popular music, beautiful production design, and delightful and emotive animation with deeply emotive characters is absolutely top class.Why does this movie not have a 95%, 99%, 100% rating? Chalk it up to RealFX not being a top of the line animation house and having the reputation of a Pixar and Dreamworks. Also possibly because this movie came out in the same period that Pixar released Coco (which was also a fantastic film) where both films explored the Day of the Dead cultural imagery and lore.But make no mistake - this movie stands head to head with all of the films produced by Pixar and Dreamworks. It's a true work of brilliance that will stand the test of time.10/10 where it is truly earned and deserved."
" It's beautiful, colorful, vibrant and above all Magnificent! You should definitely watch this and learn from it.

" Charming and energetic
",0.7717,0.9185,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,This movie is often compared to Coco and to be honest I would say that this one is not as good but it is still great. It has a compelling story with very human characters and an interesting world. The visuals and design are masterfully crafted. The Mexican cover of Radiohead was a little too much though.
" Not a great movie
",-0.5096,0.8731,2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,"SPOILERS
I didn't enjoy this movie. Its not the worst and I know people like it i just find it pretty pathetic. I lime the design of the movie, it's quite beautiful and I had a few laughs but the rest is just boring. It claims to be a day of the dead movie but it hardly acknowledges that. Its just a generic love story. Most of the jokes are bad and some of the side characters are annoying and only put in there for laughs. They're basically jar jar binks clones. The underworld is beautiful but it's in the movie for like 5 minutes. As soon as the main character arrives and realises his girlfriend isn't there he instantely tries to leave which is just pathetic. It has a narrator which if you removed her the story would play out normally. I learnt nothing about death and when the people in the underworld got resurrected i rolled my eyes. It talks about how the main character doesnt want to kill bulls because it's cruel but when people come to attack the village he doesn't hesitate about trying to kill them which I found a bit off. His father dies and no one acknowledges it like nothing happened which was silly. Overall never watching this movie again cause it's really bad."
" The Only Movie That Has Made Me Cry From Happiness
",0.128,0.9954,2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"-Beautiful, intricate character designs AND backgrounds. I have no idea why people don't acknowledge the pain-staking detail! Their skulls have these beautiful carvings that just ooze love and care.
-I love the folk approach. I love folktale-like stories. I wonder if there's a Mexican folktale it was based from.
-A lot of movies like this tend to only talk about the culture being presented but this one seems to celebrate not only Mexican but also American culture, especially through the music which is all in my iTunes library. As an Asian-American, I can definitely respect this rare encouragement of mixing cultures. I think mixing cultures creates something beautiful.
-Overarching story was great and seemed to push no one's a bad guy or a good guy. Everyone is a human with their flaws and good sides. It's about seeing the good.
-I literally cry from happiness watching this film. It's so positive.
-I feel bad bringing up Coco since its very different, but I prefer this movie hands down. Coco made me depressed. Any movie can do that. The Book of Life made me smile and sing and cry from happiness. Not many movies can do that.-I will admit the story was very rushed, but that's honestly the only flaw."
" I love this movie...
",0.6369,0.7437,2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Only one word can describe this movie for me ...
PERFECT!!!"
" Thoroughly surprising and entertaining
",0.6764,0.9979,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Like a full blown movie version of the classic game Grim Fandango, comes an equally fantastic animated adventure set in Mexico and set around the Day of the Dead celebration. Having already covered similar ground before, Guti√©rrez has created a wonderful film here with help from producer del Toro. It's a long time since an animated film has captured me and held my interest and The Book of Life did that for me in spades.Manolo (Luna), Joaquin (Tatum) and Maria (Saldana) are three childhood friends who both Manolo and Joaquin have crushes on. They both vow to marry her one day, but before that their days are filled with fun and adventure. Manolo wishes to become a musical artist despite his fathers persistence that he continue in the family tradition of becoming a great bull fighter. Joaquin is a natural fighter and he wishes to be like his late father, who was a decorated soldier.Whilst this is going on, La Muerte and Xibalba who rule the the land of the remembered (La Muerte) and dead (Xibalba) are making a bet on who will eventually marry Maria. One day Maria is sent away and life goes on, until her return years later, where now grown up, both of our hero's try to win her heart. The story being based upon Mexican traditions and folklore could be lost on some but many European countries also have similar beliefs and celebrate this day. Despite this, things are pretty easy to follow.The animation style is vivid and colourful as one might expect and very Latin in style. There is also always something going on in the corner of your eye or behind a main character, so it is easy to miss many of the little animated wonders that hide within this quirky feature. A lot of people have complained about the pacing but I never had a problem with it, allowing myself to be introduced to the characters and then taken along their journey, of which for Manolo there are many.The story itself is very good (while cliched at times) and the voice acting from the exceptional cast to bring the animation to life is excellent all round. Likewise the soundtrack is wonderful too, even with the pop songs sung with a Mexican flavour. The film also has some brilliant humour with some wickedly funny lines. As with most of these types of animated films, there are jokes for all age ranges with many probably going over younger viewers heads.The Book of Life takes you on a wonderful and colourful journey with tears and joy in equal measure, but also with a message to tell that isn't condescending. Funny, dark, surreal, the story is well written and there is literally so much going on there should be something for everyone. The animation style is second-to-none and Guti√©rrez and del Toro really have crafted something special that is far superior in my opinion to any of the recent lazy offerings from either Dreamworks or Pixar.
The Sage's Rating: 8/10"
" I couldn't finish it
",0.0,0.885,2020-04-02 00:00:00,2,"I usually adore stop animation films but this one bothered me because it had way too much bright colors all the time. There was too much stuff going on every minute on every inch of the screen. It was too overwhelming, too distracting, too much blaring at you all the time. Its like you want to squint or take a break or you get nervous. Its hard to explain but you ought to be able to see what I mean by the images. Its like a ""Where's Waldo?"" movie or find 10 hidden objects every 10 seconds. There's no subtle plain easy on the eyes backgrounds, distances, skies, walls, or floors. It's all scrambled with no specific area directing you where to look. Shouldn't the main character stand out? Usually you know what to watch to follow the story but not in this film. There's no calm relaxed scene in the movie. Every single atom is saturated with so many bright colors screaming at you that your eyes dash all over the screen trying to figure out what's asking for your attention. You don't know where to look to understand the story. Was this an experiment to see if it could show what it feels like to live with ADD? Or what it's like to have a bad trip on acid? I had to turn it off...I felt a migraine coming on."
" A little unusual, bit has some charming elements
",0.5859,0.973,2020-03-18 00:00:00,6,"I heard a lot of people praise Book of Life when Coco was coming out, and I can see why now, because there are a number of thematic and story similarities between the two. However, I'm going to try to assess Book of Life on its own merits, as it could never measure up to Coco for me. That is a masterpiece, and does a better job of shedding light on the traditions involved in The Day of the Dead, where this one just uses that holiday as a backdrop for a loosely related story. So, let's just talk about Book of Life from here on out. I found the style of animation in this film odd. In some ways, it was bright and adorable with a playful style that looks like someone telling a story with actual toys. However, there are other things in the film that are awkward and odd. Some characters have strangely squared-off faces, and others have abstract features that look like a Picasso. I don't mind either style but seeing them both in scenes together can be jarring. Manolo and Maria don't look like they should be in the same film, let alone falling in love with one another.The strange juxtaposition was also present in the voice cast. Many of the major characters are played by actual Mexican actors with authentic accents, but then they throw in Zoe Saldana and Channing Tatum, which seems strange. The plot of Book of Life is a relatively simple one, and has some of its foundation in traditional religious stories and fairy tales. I sometimes struggle with cliched love triangles, but I thought this movie did a nice job of avoiding many of the common pitfalls of those stories. The characters behaved in a logical way, and the woman wasn't a heartless person, who's affection blew back and forth at a moment's notice. She also wasn't a helpless damsel in distress, which was a nice change of pace. There were a few story issues, particularly at the end, that made no sense but I don't want to go into it and spoil things. Finally, I found the framing sequence odd and unnecessary. As a whole, Book of Life is a decent film, but made some weird choices that didn't work for me."
" Cute Day of the Dead tale
",-0.3182,0.9068,2020-03-10 00:00:00,7,"The Book of Life is creative and breathtaking. The animation is fun and colorful. They are very festive and you can tell that the animators pay close attention to detail. The story draws you in by adding laughs here and there, music, and love. People from around the world get to see what Day of the Dead is really like for Mexicans and you actually get to enjoy it.
The actors/actresses are perfect for their roles and bring life to the story. The scenes are very thought out and interesting. You just can't help but want to see what could happen next."
" Too Misandristic
",0.0,0.9678,2020-01-30 00:00:00,2,"This movie is sexist! As I was watching the first 30 mins of the movie it seemed ok but then there are moments of just sexist toxic femininity sprinkled here & there....üôÑ It has depicted the main female lead in a very masculine way & our hero & his friend as beta women pleasers üò£. Overall from my observation of the first 30 mins of this movie I say that this is a movie with a good story sprinkled with a lot of subtle toxic femininity, I see it as a propganda movie promoting weak, beta male, women pleaser behaviour in men & toxic, snobby & masculine behaviour in women. I highly suggest you to avoid this & wish you well in keeping your children away from such harmful material. For the quality of the graphics I give it 1 extra star but other than that this movie is not deserving of it's IMDB page rating."

I might be in the minority on this one, but whereas Coco (2017) was so unbelievably breathtaking in its use of the Mexican holiday, this film, despite debuting before, merely uses Day of the Dead as more of a backdrop than anything."
" Bland Attempt at Entertainment
",0.4215,-0.2505,2019-04-11 00:00:00,5,"If you're looking for an adult-friendly, heartfelt animated film as an introduction to Mexican culture, keep looking. Or go and watch Coco, which is everything this movie is not.Although the animation style is relatively fresh and different, the story is simply trite. It's obviously meant only for children and the few adult-friendly jokes fall flat. The conflict is manufactured and the story is predictable to the point of being insufferable, with a morally questionable lesson considering the ending for the central villain. Everything seems inconsequential and leaves you wondering what was the point.Finally I'm not an SJW, and actually don't pay much attention to this issue, but this movie had even me questioning how it depicts Mexican culture. It's appropriation of the highest level reducing the culture to mariachi and bullfighting without teaching the viewer anything."
" The Book Of Life Review

Though he serves only as producer, Guillermo del Toro's fingerprints seem to be all over this animated romantic-comedy woven around the Mexican Day Of The Dead. Childhood friends Manolo (Diego Luna) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) both love Maria (Zoe Saldana), and their romantic rivalry has caught the eyes of Xibalba (Ron Perlman) and La Muerte (Kate del Castillo), rulers of the two kingdoms of the dead, who take bets on the victor. The lively story is animated in an appealing wooden-puppet style, and while the script doesn't zing as much as the colourful visuals, it's cute and likable.The gleefully Gothic fingerprints of Guillermo del Toro are all over this zippy excursion into Mexico's myths and legends, although the gag-count falls quite a lot short of Pixar greatness."

" Waiter, Why Are There Wooden Toys in My Coco?
",0.0,0.4364,2018-11-18 00:00:00,6,"The Book of Life made some interesting style choices for their character designs, being like wood block figures of the tale. However, it didn't have anywhere near the emotional depth of Coco, the other animated film about the Mexican Day of the Dead, and unfortunately, the pacing of the story and the humor was similar to the Madagascar and Hotel Transylvania movies, and I hate that frantic and frenetic style. That hyper bombastc approach is hard for adults to like, though some still do, don't know why. Films like this need to take a chill pill, relax a little bit, let their story and humor breathe a little bit. So that, in comparison, the pacing of Coco is more like a fine wine."

" Action, drama and emotion in a superb package
",0.6249,0.9991,2018-10-27 00:00:00,9,"When a couple of kids arrive at a museum thinking that they will have another boring day, they're welcomed by a charming lady who introduces them to a secret exhibit. What they're about to find out is a wonderful story from the land of Mexico, full of courage, love and emotion, about two kids who compete for the heart for their friend.It's an unique animation which tells a story in another story which slowly presents three different worlds, connected in various ways, which affect the fate of a bullfighter as he tries to win his friend's affection before his best friend who seems to have the advantage. His quest will be full of surprises, emotion and drama, but his pure heart will always be there to aid him while in need.The plot presented is one with a good foundation and a great intrigue, which due to its complexity, manages to be non-linear, unpredictable and full of surprises, keeping the viewer interested until the end. A couple of well-developed characters contribute decisively to the outcome, proving to be very easy to like. As you get to care for them, the entire action is raised to another level, making you feel, in a way, what the characters are going through. Quite a let-down on the other hand is the way a couple of key moments are treated in terms of storytelling, making it all seem a bit too easy. A bit more polish would have made wonders in this direction.In terms of design, the movie simply looks fabulous. Very well animated with plenty of colours and details, making it the part of the movie which is simply flawless. I really was impressed by how it looks and how many things you can show and transmit through graphics alone. Another important aspect is of course the music it has. Played in key moments of the film, it has a great gift of sending even more emotion directly to the viewer, creating a truly unique atmosphere.Overall, it's an animation which features a very good plot with great characters, transmits plenty of emotion and romance, drama but also action and simply shines in terms of visuals. As said before, it could have been truly great if some aspects of the story had been treated a bit different, but it still manages to be a great animation which I really enjoyed."

However, it was such a dissapointment with the music the movie covered and the characters personality development including the voice acting was all over the place. The singing was absolutely brutal, the guy who voiced the character Manolo sounded like a baddie henchmen rather then playing the hero of the story. I really wish Channing Tatum got the role instead of Diego Luna to be honest here. Im not gonna say anymore but this film is terrible and awful, I would regret showing my future kids in seeing this film if they really wanna see it....."
" The Book of Life boasts visually stunning animation but lacks a consistently engaging story.
",0.5994,0.977,2018-02-24 00:00:00,6,"Mexico's famous annual festivities marking ""The Day of the Dead"" is a time for reflection and remembrance. It's colourful, bright and visually striking, so much so that the rest of the globe now know of this major phenomenon. It was only a matter of time before the holiday was to be the subject of children's animations. Fortunately, we are presented with a good attempt. A small class of children are taught a fable that involves two brave heroes fighting for the heart of a damsel. Filled with Mexican traditions, music and young romance, it's a story that teaches people to follow their heart. Y'know, true love succeeds and what not. It's a perfectly fine children's animation that clearly appeals to younger audiences. The more mature viewers may find that the blatant storytelling issues will hold them back from fully enjoying this. The stand out is the animation. Absolutely stunning. The wooden effect to both the characters and architecture enhanced the playful feel of the story. The mythology of the festival was brought to life in full aesthetic appeal. The ""Land of the Remembered"" exhumed blossoming colours that invaded all of the senses. The musicality of the narrative evoked endearment towards one of the protagonists who uses his musical talent to win the heart of the girl of his dreams. One particular scene, involving a giant bull constructed of bones, was extremely touching and had me gripped. Unfortunately, that was the only time I was enthralled. Sure it's completely watchable, but it never exceeds expectations. It was a predictable ball of confusion. The first act was so frenetic, consistently jumping between scenes like a bunny rabbit on speed. Jump jump jump! Music, bull fighting, exposition, Maria, badge of invincibility...just slow down! I needed to get a notebook out! Also the voice casting choices were questionable, particularly Channing Tatum which took me out of the film occasionally. A beautiful animation that couldn't overcome narrative stumbles."
" A flawed, but still fun film.
",0.6652,0.9966,2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"If there is something I love in an animated movie, it's a story that takes us to other worlds and lets audiences dive into the cultures of foreign countries. It's always nice to see audiences learning about peoples traditions around the world. So, I'll be happy to say that you might enjoy ""The Book of Life"". However, I'll just say that this movie has flaws. A lot of them. Some of them actually did annoy me to the point where I began to think that I would hate the film overall. Luckily, that was not the case. I'll get to why this movie has some problems in a little bit, but first let me tell you the story of the film.As a bunch of students from a school are given a secret museum tour, the tour lady begins to tell them the tale revolving around the Book of Life. It revolves around two boys named Manolo (Diego Luna) and Joaqu√≠n (Channing Tatum) trying to win the hand of the lovely girl Mar√≠a (Zoe Saldana) unaware that the boys are actually part of a bet made by the spirits who rule the Land of the Remembered and Forgotten respectively, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman). Though both tries to get her hand, neither seems to succeed due to the problems of their families. However, when an incident involving Mar√≠a seems to get her killed, Manolo decides that he wants to see her with all his heart, unaware that he will be accidentally sent to the Land of the Remembered by Xibalba. After discovering the wager and realizes that Xibalba cheated, Manolo swears to try to get back to the Land of the Living in order to protect the village from an incoming danger which I won't spoil.At first when the film started, I will admit that I wasn't exactly getting into the film. Though its story had started with promise, some annoying moments which will be brought up in a bit really were getting on my nerves. However, when our lead gets to the Land of the Remembered, the film really picked up its pace and became both exciting and funny. I loved how much creativity was put into the movie and the cultural elements that were put into the movie though I feel that some elements could have been treated with more respect which is strange considering this is from a Mexican director with help from famed director Guilllelmo del Toro. As for it's animation, this was definitely the highlight of the movie. It's absolutely beautiful. There was so much color and life put into it leading to some very eye-popping moments. As for the characters, they have some charm to them. I think my favorite character in the movie was Maria. I loved how she actually had some toughness put into her and Zoe Saldana really put a lot of edge to her making her very relatable. Now let's get to my problems. One was the music choice. Considering this film is set in Mexico, there were some weird moments were music like Ode to Joy and Carmen were played and just left me scratching my head. Some of the humor at the beginning was also a little immature and did annoy me though it heavily improved when we got to the Land of the Remembered. I also feel that the film won't be timeless. For example, Maira states while she was in Europe she took fencing lessons which made sense, though later during the climax, she also says she learned kung fu. Wait, hold on a second. Kung fu? Where did that come from? Elements like that made no sense. However, what really annoyed me about the film were the song choices. Throughout the movie they put in some mariachi covers of songs like ""I Will Wait"" by Mumford and Sons and even ""Creep"" by Radiohead. I mean seriously? Who in the world wants to hear a mariachi cover of Creep? I really don't know who and in all honestly don't want to know. That's really all the flaws I had.""The Book of Life"" does have a lot of problems, but luckily the film did improve and allowed me to give this film a recommendation. Though the story does have a slow start, it does improve and it's animation is definitely what makes it worth watching. When you watch it though, just be prepared to sit through a few less than stellar moments."
" An underrated film
",0.0,0.9597,2017-12-19 00:00:00,8,"I personally love this film. It was really good. Not only does it capture the Day of the Dead very well, but it is both funny AND emotional. No wonder Reel FX learned after the disaster they caused with Free Birds.I think Jorge R. Gutierrez must've been influenced by Don Bluth and/or even John R. Dilworth when it comes to making this film, and that is awesome.I love the animation, the characters, the humor, the acting, a lot of things in this movie are really good.I even enjoyed the song ""No Matter Where You Are"". Even my mom loved this film. I find Manolo a very likable character.I highly recommend this film if you're looking for an animated Day of the Dead film, other than Disney and Pixar's Coco."
" Write Your Own Story
",0.0,0.9989,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"It's not often when you get a movie made in America that celebrates a foreign holiday as Did De Los Muertos, yet here comes a passion project from Jorge R. Gutierrez called The Book of Life, a film that is more of a visual film compared to it's basic story, but is nonetheless a great love letter to Mexican culture and to those who want to choose their own destiny.Right off the bat, the animation never holds back in it's creativity, from the highly vibrant colors, to Gutierrez's joyful cartoony character designs, to the Mexicana backgrounds, and some of the finest effects animation I've ever seen in computer animation to date. What really makes the characters stand out is how they are made as puppets to recreate the sense that it is a story told through fantasy. But the true highlight of the visuals is the Land of the Remembered, and without giving away anything, it knocks the cultural and artistic aspect of the movie out of the ball park, though I wish we spent a little longer there....buttersauce.Admittedly, the story is kinda generic in concept, complete with several clich√©s you would find in modern day animated films, but the main characters are charming and likable in their own way so it makes the experience a delight. Even the supporting cast all have their own quirks and charming personalities that work well to present them as lovable and memorable, although the villain was kinda forgettable. And even at that, the execution is just beautiful, from the passionate love triangle, to the songs that elevate the main character, and even the message to do what you feel is right rather than what others say.Overall, while its story is kinda formulaic, The Book of Life redeems itself tremendously with stunning animation, charming characters, such sweet romance, and such passion and respect for Mexican culture. Jorge Gutierrez has not really made another film as of now, but with a directorial debut this good, I cannot wait to see what else he has under his belt. Gracias Senior Gutierrez, and I look forward to that ""Citizen Kane of wresting movies"" you've got planned for the future."
" Day of the Dead!
",-0.68,0.9885,2017-10-22 00:00:00,7,"A good movie to watch this time of year! A bullfighter, who wants to be a singer, tries to win the hand of his true love, Maria! And he must go through the Land of the Remembered on the Day of the Dead to do so! The animation is really cool, and original! I especially liked the vibrant colors of the Land of the Remembered and the beautiful look of La Muerte! The music in here is also cool, with guitarista ""covers"" of Biz Markie, Elvis Presley, Rod Stewart, Mumford and Sons, and an awesome version of ""Creep"" by Radiohead! The movie was a hit with my 9 1/2 year old daughter too!"
" Colourful, energetic fun
",0.7351,0.8761,2017-10-14 00:00:00,8,"""Book of Life"" spins an animated fable through three worlds, ours, a fantasy world of wooden characters, and the lands of the dead, both remembered and forgotten (a great concept). The colour-soaked animation is mesmerising in places, especially the joyful world of the remembered dead. The story is a bit simple, given the complexity of the visuals, but still watchable and the characters are entertaining. Given the Latino themes, I found some of the voices in my English version a bit out of place (especially Zoe Saldana's) - I can't say why I'd have preferred everyone speak in Spanish-accented English but I would have. All-in-all, a fun movie that's worth watching if only for the aesthetic experience."
" Amazing Family Movie
",0.5859,0.9938,2017-10-03 00:00:00,9,"As a large movie lover, owning over 1000 on DVD, I found The Book of Life to be an excellent movie. This movie is an excellent choice for families. I would give the movie a nine out of ten. I believe that this movie earns this because of its story, ability to relate to characters, overall message, and influences from Mexican culture. These factors make it a great teaching moment for families with small children. They get to learn about other cultures while getting some amazing entertainment from relatable characters. The Book of Life is about three kids, Manolo, Joaquin, and Maria, who are the best of friends. These friends learn to overcome obstacles such as distance, and jealousy to keep their friendship alive, and healthy. In the beginning the three mischievously release pigs destroying parts of the town. At this point we find out that Marias dad is the mayor of the town. Maria gets sent away for many years, and both the boys end up falling in love with her. They overcome these things realizing that their friendship, and their connection to one another is more important than the love for Maria. The three ultimately defeat the villain, and save their town. They may relate to some of the characters opinions on how their children are acting. For instance, there are times when we see Manolo and Maria arguing with their parents, and not doing want they want them to. In these times we see their parents getting mad and raise their voices. Parents can relate to the feeling of children not wanting to follow their rules, or not doing what they ask of them. Children are able to relate to the main character, and they can feel like they are not the only ones that feel some way. As in their not the only children who don't always want to do what their parents want them to. The overall message in The Book of Life is to follow your heart. This message is good for all young and slightly less young. It is good for parents to hear that they can follow still follow their dream, and that their children can also follow their dreams. The main character did not want to follow the life that his father, and grandmother laid out for him. Instead he wanted to follow his heart by play an instrument. Some parents may see this as disobedience which may cause them to be upset, but I believe that the overall message is stronger that the fact that Manolo went against his father's wishes. As I've stated the movie depicts many Mexican cultural influences. The movie is set in Mexico showing many of the things that happen in the culture such as bull fighting, multiple generations living in the same home, and names of people. The movie also shows the strong sense of family. In Mexican cultures family is the most important thing. We can see this in the way that they have large families in the in the land of the remembered (part of the afterlife). The afterlife also incorporates pieces of Mexican culture such as sugar skulls and Mexican food items. The cultural influences are sprinkled into the entire move making it partially educational. If you're looking for a good movie for your family to watch over the weekend The Book of Life will entertain all family members no matter what the age. The movie is great for giving an insight to Mexican culture bringing families closer. Especially because it shows that family is the most important thing."
