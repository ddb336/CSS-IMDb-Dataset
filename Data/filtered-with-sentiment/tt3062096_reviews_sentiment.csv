" Ruined the ending
",-0.4767,-0.9688,2021-02-25 00:00:00,3,"The movie was pretty fun. But the beauty of the book was ruined with this COMPLETELY different climax/ending. The ending of the book and the thoughts that it provoked were beautiful. Bertrand was a total villain but he wasn't a mindless psychopath out to kill billions. In the book, he didn't kill anyone, just took their ability to reproduce. The movie changed his virus to be fatal, and it wasn't released as it was in the book. I don't know which is more offensive to me, the ending of the Inferno movie, or the awful ending of the Hannibal movie (again, switched the entire ending of the book to movie to make it more digestible to boring/basic people).Love the book, the movie was üëéüèª"

" Another Philosophical Treasure Hunt
",0.296,0.9694,2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Another treasure hunt across Europe as Langdon acts surprised that the world's leading bodies seek his help, should be expected once you've traced Jesus and discovered the Illuminati in the Catholic church. Anyway, in a very similar fashion to the two previous films, Hanks is joined by a female sidekick who also happens to be a genius. Following a series of clues they try to prevent an inevitable doom. If you enjoyed the former films in the series, you'll enjoy this one too.Again though, there are big plot holes easily spotted, and quite often the dialogue is used to just blind you with art, philosophy and history so you don't think about how daft it's all getting. Seriously, the billionaire could have just opened the bag before the story even takes place and stopped any attempts to stop him. Common sense would suggest the story is just ridiculous.Plenty of twists along the way to keep up with, but to be fair, you're able to keep a grasp on what's happening throughout if you focus on the bare plot. It moves swiftly, acting is adequate, and it is enjoyable if you manage not to pick it all apart. If you didn't mind similar holes in the Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons, then Inferno can certainly be enjoyed."

" Malthus is a dead would-be prophet
",-0.6486,-0.9902,2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"When the book came out in 2013, we were expecting a book by Dan Brown with Dante and his Inferno as the central piece. Definitely. But it finally came out and it left us totally aghast. It was made into a film with Tom Hanks as Professor Langdon and I just wonder here if the film corrected the surprising non-scientific - not say anti-scientific - discourse of the book. I am afraid not because the action is visual, and it covers up the scientific discourse that is reduced to as little as possible. It becomes the danger of a pandemic and since then we have been experiencing, for now, more than one full year such a pandemic and we know everything about it. The other day, a couple of months ago, a Jehovah Witness militant contacted me on the phone and started quoted the Old Testament to prove science was right, and pretty soon we were going to live forever. That discourse was totally anti-Christian because for the Christian religion death is an essential step in our lives, both on earth and beyond. It is the possibility to enter the procedure that might bring us to the Messianic Jerusalem. Death is necessary for Christians. And death is ever-present in the Old Testament, at least as much as in the New Testament, though without the possibility for ALL humans to be saved and to have eternal life in the Messianic Jerusalem. In the Old Testament that promotion after death is only open to the Jews since God is the God the elected people, exclusively thus the Jews.I told the Jehovah Witness militant that the earth is already overcrowded since it overconsumes about forty percent of earthen resources every year, meaning that the Earth will only regenerate 60% of all the resources we consume. That is the formula to a catastrophe, to the famous apocalypse. What can we do about it? But we must remember all we consume, no matter how we produce it, artificially, in labs, in fields, or simply by gathering and hunting it will always come from resources we find on earth and if we consume more than the earth can regenerate the earth will end up dying and us along with it and probably in dire straits, in long years of mutual and reciprocal slaughtering and genocide, and with a big nuclear bang that will explode the earth itself, like the 63-year-old man did in Nashville Tennessee on Christmas Day 2020.But to cover the stakes of this film we have to look at them in detail even if the film is skimpy on these scientific elements. Our verdict will be that either the terrorists in the film are amateurs, and badly trained ones at that, or Professor Langdon and his associates are pretty genial and superhuman. Actually, it is the last qualifying adjective the film wants us to come to as the concluding characteristic, and this is of course absurd. WHO or no WHO, to prevent such terroristic act from mad scientists there is only one solution: to solve the real problem at stake here, hence, to start reducing the pollution created by humanity and to start taking the strict measures we need to take to stop the growth of the population and try even to start reducing it? I must say that a pandemic is an easy solution. Unluckily with human science, we can slow it down and probably stop it within just a couple of years. But let us examine the case of this ""Inferno"" that is casually linked to Dante but just for fun since the code and the enigma is shown so fast that we cannot actually capture it, except in the various locations it brings up. This is a case of touristic terrorism.But let get into some simple questions.The case - as exposed in the book and echoed in the film - is fast, multiple as for the point of view, very dynamic, sliced into so short chapters that have a high taste of TV series with some of them sliced up a second time like split hairs, that in the end we are confronted with a scattered jigsaw puzzle. I don't really like that kind of massive loaf of bread chopped up so thin we don't have time to assess a situation before it is already gone, since there never - or nearly never - is a fully developed situation. Just titbits you have to sort out and assemble the way you want if you are not particular about the storyline, or the way you can or should if you want to keep up with some storyline. With the book, you can stop and go back. With the film, you cannot really do that, and you would need the subtitle to make sure you catch everything, particularly the scientific jargon.At the same time, the story is multiple with many points of view and that gives a real dynamism to the tale that a more consistent or continuous story-telling technique would not necessarily produce, would even very probably not produce. Especially when you know it all plays on the eyes that are used to see a character and speak about her or him, the eyes of another character, and not always the same. Some kind of inner voyeurism from one voyeur into another voyeur who pays the same homage to the first one: reciprocal and crisscrossing voyeur's points of view. One of these voyeurs is struck by some important loss of memory and some other characters are just superficially identified by this or that momentary and transient voyeur, mostly Langdon who is under complete delusion due to his loss of memory, but several others too. That voyeuristic voyeurism - sorry for the redundancy - is becoming literally vertiginous or vertigo-engendering in the audience. If it got collective it would mean panic.Then the story is complicated. Just the way we like them with multiple riddles, I mean real riddles, to be solved, multiple places and multiple discoveries though some are not credible in the case of Robert Langdon, a top global art specialist and symbologist. For one example let's consider his lack of competence in the following situation. As soon as he knew about the severed heads of some horses and the context they came up in he should have known they were in Venice, which he did, and that the doge who brought them there was Henricus Dandolo and that his tomb they were looking for was not in Venice but in ""Hell on Earth,"" one foot in the water and the other underground and the whole thing in Greek and another non-Indo-European language. And that should have been enough for him to know exactly in what city and in what building there the whole riddle was to find its solution. We suspend our disbelief, and we understand it is a story told to dummies and that the main character, the author of a hot-selling book on Christian symbology in Muslim countries (after a long period of Orthodox Christianity), or something like that, can also be a dummy, though he is asserted as the best in his field. I just wonder what the worst could be.We would be ready to forgive such sloppy moments if the book were not a dystopia so much committed to the famous Malthus, who has an extremely bad reputation, that it becomes a sort of prediction that is actually realized and accepted. We can already see ourselves in our mind's eye being a 35-billion humanity. And the acceptation of this dramatic prediction about the future of the world tampered with by a crazy mad scientist is fulfilled in less than five hours at the global level implying that the world is in the hands of a mad scientist and a few, very few people who have all powers and can decide of what is good or bad for the whole world, what is acceptable or not for the whole planet, on their own accord and absolute unquestioned power in their isolated minds that are fantasized as giants in a world of midgets. They are like secularized almighty lords or gods. We are reinventing the Greek mythology in which the world was governed by a band of half-crazy sexually perverse and obsessed liars, cheaters, assassins, and criminals of all sorts for whom humanity was nothing g but the backyard of their house of games and casino of sexual phantasies.But what is this Malthusian dystopia?Since the population of the earth will soon reach or jump over nine billion people, the planet will have reached its maximum population and this overpopulating species known as Homo Sapiens will come to an end, will get extinct like so many other species. Full stop. No discussion, please. Me and I, Zeus, am telling you that is what is going to happen, and I will not do anything to prevent it. It is mathematical, mathematics being the new religion of the modern Pharaohs. At least ""my"" mathematics, says the mad scientist.His solution is a whim of his genial mind that is preventing the extinction of the species by managing its fertility. The solution is a viral vector that in eight days contaminates the whole planet from one single point at full Internet speed. This viral vector modifies the DNA of the human beings who are infected, in fact, all of them, in order to make them haphazardly sterile, one out of three. The two non-sterile human beings left are not at all seen as being able to take advantage of the situation. Note it concerns both men and women and apparently it is the same viral vector that is used for both though the fertility of man and that of woman are not at all genetically identical hence carried out by the same genes which would require two different viral vectors The number of children of a society is determined as an average per fertile women but within what this society considers as a total possible feasible maximum, consciously like in China or France in antagonistic directions, or unconsciously like in most other countries. If some women or some men are sterile the total number of children will be the same anyway because it is some unconscious biological rule governed by some ideological vision of what is necessary for the species to survive that is at work, there.Dan Brown should know that apart from the strictly Muslim countries and some sections of the American society, the number of children is going down, even in Africa though he seems to say the reverse in a very unfair anti-Catholic diatribe that does not honor his [...]"
" Good movie, ruined ending that was already the best part of the book

I have read them all and I pretty much like them a lot. I watched the movie after being very excited for it - the previous movies were not bad (not great, not terrible, but definitely watchable), I liked it and then you cannot imagine my disappointment and anger with the ending.

" So Close but So Far Off
",0.0,-0.0516,2020-12-28 00:00:00,5,I felt the need to write this review as someone who didn't read any of the books. I have however watched all of the movies with the Da Vinci Code being my favrotie. I cannot say the same for this movie. It was too fast paced and felt seriously lacking in story development. I found myself missing the mythology and what not that had been introduced and expanded on in the first movie. I wish they had slowed down with this one.

So not all the plotlines are as aqual to the book. No one can denie that this was a good movie( forget about the books for a second). Story was nice, character development was also great and the plotwists were unexpected"
" Inferno even raises good questions, but openly fails to develop them beyond instant consumption.
",-0.4118,0.9989,2020-12-13 00:00:00,6,"Dan Brown's book is about a gigantic conspiracy that puts two possibilities in antagonistic positions: halving the global population or extinction of humanity in less than 100 years. As no narrative can be told in the most obvious way, Ron Howard's third foray into this universe starring Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), one of his most dubious works, decides to shuffle all the details of this discussion, which, in reality, does not it is no discussion, since the plot complicates all the details, but in the end it barely says anything. The surface is the mystery, just him, with everything else being too shallow. We are talking about a recipe from a trilogy - started in The Da Vinci Code and continued in Angels and Demons - that tires more and more as the viewer, in face of so many elements in common, understands the scheme adopted by the author of the book and, consequently, the film's screenwriter.The difference between this and the predecessors is not only the timing, since Dan Brown is no longer the author of the moment, which distances Inferno from any investigative adventure is the disinterest with which he treats the revelations and relates them to the current context. There is no weight or urgency in the problems solved by Langdon, only answers to an interesting Art History trivia. After dealing with the family of Christ in The Da Vinci Code and the Iluminatti in Angels and Demons, Langdon becomes involved with a millionaire obsessed with Dante Alighieri, creator of the Divine Human Comedy. Bertrand Zobrist, played by the always eccentric Ben Foster (Warcraft), thinks that humanity is about to be extinguished and believes that the only way to avoid this is to kill a good part of the Earth's inhabitants with a virus. And despite talking about it countless times, there is no sense of danger in the threats.As with any good Brown mystery, human tragedy is directly linked to Europe's greatest geniuses and cities - in the case of Inferno Dante and Boticelli they are the chosen faces; while Florence, Istanbul and Venice are the stage for the hunt for Langdon and the World Health Organization, which enters here as the 'system'. Ron Howard and screenwriter David Koepp seem to have found the hand to adapt the text full of historical and cultural references by Dan Brown. Inferno is the shortest in the trilogy, with ""only"" 122 minutes, compared to 153 in the first and 138 in the second. Although not everything is brazen enough, like the big turn of Inferno, the spectator naturally senses that something will happen. Ron Howard does not denounce, instigate, or even confuse the public - at least, not in that sense - since, in reality, the public is already aware of a natural doubt, the result of a recycled product with the same elements.The lack of a good plot, which is very simplistic, is what bothers most. Tom Hanks does what he can with the script in hand, but he can't add anything in terms of character development. At the end of the plot, a love relationship is strung, just like that, completely tasteless, as if a parallel between the teacher and Dante Alighieri, who had a platonic passion for Beatriz - here emulated, but without the same effect, was necessary. The actor's work is merely reactive, something that cannot be said of the character Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), much less tasteless than the protagonist, but still problematic, since the story, after all, is very bad. By playing a doctor who becomes Langdon's escape partner by chance, Felicity Jones manages, until the third half of the film, to develop a very interesting identity for her character. But other figures are in the middle of the game, interested in the virus. In this way, Inferno introduces some more characters, although their construction and study work is nil, positively influenced, at most, by good performances. Not even Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster), interested in the decimation of half the human race, gets space for the script to be a layered character.As in previous films, the script, although more streamlined, has flaws and the same feeling that a lot of information is thrown to the viewer in a short time, continues. Some deductions made by the characters take place too quickly and the connection between them sometimes sounds a little forced. The script's puzzles lend themselves more to a reverence for the original material than a challenge. The public is not a part of solving the mysteries, which makes it somewhat uninteresting. A few have clues planted with some close-ups or the viewer's intuition. Everything is solved very quickly and soon followed by another puzzle. When we are called it is only as spectators of narrative exhibitions that do not make sense. Dialogues between two specialists were expected to bring about greater refinement.In another instance, Inferno really ends up looking like a parody of its own format, discouraging the viewer from thinking anything but the improbable. The script, intolerable as it is, does not know how to conduct the mysteries, being more a walking box of historical curiosities than anything else, at least, narratively functional. Returning to the character of Langdon's amnesia, the inconsistency between what the professor has lost memory or does not go according to the function of this in the narrative. But, for some reason, the writers decided to include a shameful dialogue in which the protagonist tries to unravel the name of a dark liquid, which people drink in the morning. On the other hand, all the historical curiosities, of this walking encyclopedia that is Langdon, have not been forgotten. In addition, it is also noted that most of the lines of dialogue are completely unnecessary exposures.There are two major disappointments in the film. The first is the misuse of references to Dante Alighieri's original work. Based on one of the main literary works in history, limiting the narrative to a game of cat and mouse and only scratching superficially such issues as the world's overpopulation is very little. The second is the poor use of the countless beautiful locations used by the film. It is unacceptable that a feature film that takes place in such peculiar and beautiful cities has such an obvious and lifeless photograph. Even if in a more effectively narrative way or at least in a contemplative way, the scenarios are hardly visualized - you don't feel yourself in those environments. The plans when they are in Florence, Venice and Istanbul are in a way beautiful and use all the historical structure of these cities to show the grandeur. Places such as the Florence Duomo, St. Mark's Basilica in Venice and Istanbul's Hagia Sophia are well used. The closed camera and the soundtrack (by the great Hans Zimmer) also do not help in this context.At least, some passages are interesting. Langdon's hallucinations and thoughts are not limited to holographs in the middle of the sculptures. Here the circles of Inferno take shape in burned and deformed humans, while Howard opts for a more nervous camera, lost in the focus between environment and actors, accelerating the pace of the story more than in the original publication. The balcony helps to make the trajectory of the protagonist duo more frantic, but it does not advance to the point of giving an identity to the feature. If, on the one hand, the effects work partially when showing scenes with some degree of disgust, on the other hand, not making better use of the space of cities like Venice, Florence and Istanbul is almost a crime.Another noteworthy aspect is that the direction of Ron Howard, together with the edition, establishes a very confusing narrative line. Whoever read the book, will be well situated in specific scenes. Who follows only the films, will be lost with very disconnected action sequences. The filmmaker shows himself incapable of efficiently conducting action scenes in this film, which, basically, are reduced to interrupted runs. Howard makes sure to fill the sequences of quick cuts, as well as camera shake, tiring the viewer and making everything boring again. Inferno ends up wanting in its third step, at the end of the whole journey to contain the pathogen. After the viewer understands exactly who the villain is and who the good guys are, and this is established, the clich√© already seen in Angels and Demons gains space. If in the previous work it was to save Rome and the Vatican, now it is to save humanity. The outcome lacks the way Langdon and the WHO team finally succeed. It is as if the feature had gone so far, in the end to arrive in a warm moment. Howard chose to change the ending of the original story, which may have been a shot in the foot. After two great successful productions, variations are needed for a new one to stand out. And that's when Howard should have kept the original plot, creating something surprising and unpredictable instead of the classic 'happy ending'.In the end, Inferno brings almost nothing new in relation to the films already released. If Langdon's instability brings a certain freshness, not only to the character, but to the plot itself as a whole, the feature film insists on being extremely didactic, explaining in detail all the intricacies of the various sub-cores, which makes it very tiring - it deals from the old obsession of American blockbusters in delivering everything chewed to the viewer, so that he does not bother to reason. Inferno even raises good questions, but openly fails to develop them beyond instant consumption. His characters are also just drafted and gain basic outlines to become believable within such an artificial universe."

",0.4019,0.3551,2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,Inferno is action and crime movie. It has a lot of religious background. It actually makes you think of the things said in the movie. Has good actors and actresses. At some points of the movie it's a little bit confusing as to what the actors are trying to accomplish with the different clues and passages they find along their way. It keeps you on edge because you don't think they will be able to stop the virus from spreading. It is mainly based in Italy as it has a lot of religion in this movie. I really liked it even though at times I didn't really comprehend the passages or clues they would find.

Istanbul is a multicultural, modern city. But there they showed it like just a muslim city. I don't mean to underestimate the other muslim cities that are magnificent. It's just not the soul of Istanbul which was needed to be shown. Of course there are good shots that were taken like the one in Yerebatan Sarnici.
Besides that, movie was good but I have a general prejudice about the movies that were made from a book. I love books and definitely I will read the book version."
" Inferno
",0.0,0.9192,2020-04-28 00:00:00,6,Highly anticipated though delivered very poorly due to personally in my opinion is due to lack of innovation as the predecessors. (The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Angels and Demons (2009))The story is itself shallow having an antagonist of the plot to destroy the world but still would have pulled of a stunning visual feast if the film gave depth to Dante and his literature which was highly quoted throughout the film.And also Robert Langdon's visions are more like hallucinations where in predecessor films he actually had some awesome thoughts to figure out the puzzles he was given.Anyway there's Robert Langdon and it's Ron Howard. So the film manages to survive through the directors visual style.Overall - 3/5

The movie is good but stating that it's based on INFERNO novel made it worse.

There are lots of alterations that makes it from being in Awe to Meh.
The element of surprise is altered heavily, they opened the suspense of vector virus far sooner than I expected & the virus was never actually saved but in movie it was saved.
As a stand-alone movie it is good but after reading book I was highly disappointed with it.
If you have read the book don't watch it with high hopes.
I didn't like the character played of Provost by Irrfan Khan. Provost in book was calm and smart but movie he felt dumb at times.

Other than that:The script is just terrible. There are lines spoken by MR. Bouchard and the Head of the WHO which are laughable: ""I want you do to better. Work better. Think better. Now go!"". Something along those lines, and that is just an example.
Also they treat the audience like an idiot but having to say out loud everything that the images already suggest ""just like in Dante's!"" Ugh.The acting is incredibly unconvincing. Omar Sy's (Mr. Bouchard) words all sound awkward and Felicity Jones' character Siena is also severely lacking in motivation / background to justify the changes of heart.The novel on which it is based is of course very fast paced. But that does not mean you cannot have a slow scene. Apparently the Team in Inferno would rather do dizzying camera chases than building a gripping steady scene that builds characters.Not worthy watching at all.PS: For those who read the book, probably it should be rated even lower.

",0.0,0.309,2019-05-20 00:00:00,3,"This movie had potential, and it was a fairly entertaining story. The issue for me, was the over the top Hollywood treatment. It was nonstop action, but instead of being fun, it got tedious really quickly. Hanks somehow seemed out of his element. And the story had too many twists and turns. It caused dizziness.Forced to retrace his own steps, with only Dr. Brooks to assist him, Langdon comes to the horrifying realization he's a pawn in a massive global conspiracy involving billionaire recluse Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) and the works of Dante Alighieri, most notably the latter's depiction of Hell. On a journey that will catapult them across Europe with agents of the World Health Organization, including dogged French investigator Christoph Bouchard (Omar Sy), intent on catching them, the duo are in a race against time to stop a horrific virus from being unleashed that will wipe out half the world's population. Also, not only is that mysterious assassin still after them, so is the shadowy Harry Sims (Irrfan Khan), the cryptic bureaucrat knowing more about what is going on than he'll freely admit. Khan was the best part of the film. He was fun to watch, and had some great lines.The convoluted story, eventually transpires any in a fashion that was without intelligence, the sheer stupidity of it all reminding one of a ""24"" subplot that Jack Bauer would have taken care of in the first couple of episodes. The sheer volume of red herrings grows increasingly tiresome, as do the supposed twists that arise during the final 30 minutes. The climax is an obvious cacophony of sound and fury, the only thing making it notable being the inspired setting and Howard's initial attempt to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock, namely the symphony hall finale of his 1956 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. But it's all just too silly to take even slightly seriously, the explosive final seconds about as thrilling as sitting in a dental chair waiting for the Novocain to kick in. Frankly, I think I may have preferred a visit to my dentist."

On the contrary, I often prefer the heartbreaking, sad, dramatic finale. However, the book's resolution renders the entire book pointless. I read hundreds of pages of exciting race against time, biting my nails and waiting to see the protagonists solve the mystery before humanity is doomed, and only to have it revealed that none of it mattered. So, what's the point, if not just to throw in one last cheap twist? No thanks, that's bad writing. I had no issues with the movie.

" A SHOCKING WASTE OF FILM
",-0.6705,-0.6471,2019-03-23 00:00:00,1,"What on earth was this all about ? The first hour or so consistes of Hanks and his lady companion, a young doctor who seems to have a death wish, rushing around being chased by heaven knows who and being involved in all manner of derring-do. Why ? The dialogue tells viewers almost nothing and an assortment of characters wander in and out without giving any real indication of their purpose. That Hanks' character, Robert Lagndon, is suffering from partial amnesia doesn't help. Eventually there is some explanation but the film soon returns to its previous frenetic and nonsensical line and it's only in the last 30 minutes that things become at all clear.The story jumps from scene to scene with little continuity; flashbacks as events from Langdon's memory return render things still more confusing. The female companion slips seamlessly from being a hospital doctor to being a fully-fledged super woman - ludicrous. Of course, there's more to her than meets the eye, which any viewer with perception would already have concluded.The story is almost incomprehensible, much of the dialogue, such as it is, is delivered in the modern staccato mumbles and frequently at such speed as to render following the action difficult to say the least. A noisy background soundtrack, presumably intended to create an atmosphere of excitement (it fails), is just noise.I haven't read the book, though I have read other Langdon stories and enjoyed them, other films, too. This one, though, is sheer tripe. The characters have no appeal, and demand neither empathy nor sympathy. In fact, they make no impact of any sort and one is left caring not a jot about them or their fates, whether they are the 'good guys' or the bad. The actors appear to be doing nothing but going through the motions.Without a doubt, this is one of the poorest films I've ever seen, with no redeeming features."

Details inevitably need to be changed or left out and I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is changing the essence of characters, or ignoring the central themes. Ron Howard does both these things in Inferno. The film is so far removed from the book that I'm not even sure why they bothered.
There are so many things wrong with this film, but just to mention a few... The ridiculous ""love"" story between Langdon and Sinskey, an unnecessary and laughable ""twist"". Changing Sienna's character and motivations completely. She was the one with the fear of being alone, not Zobrist and she wanted to prevent the virus, not release it. The virus NOT being released, which takes all the impact away from the story.
Four stars for this mess of a movie is generous. There are only two reasons why I'm giving it any stars at all. The first is Tom Hanks, who does an admirable job with the garbage he is given, and the second is that it was shot on location.
If you're a fan of the book, don't put yourself through it. If you haven't read the book, I assume you'll have no idea what's going on because the storytelling is so hectic and disjointed, so don't waste your time either."
" Confusingly Interesting as a Non-Langdon movie at First
",0.0772,0.8919,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"19 April 2017. Tom Hanks has a particularly difficult performance to carry in Inferno as Robert Langdon in this newest semi-mystic adventure thriller. With a twist revealed about two-thirds of the way through the film which really helps establish the odd tone of this movie, it hard to determine how much of the previous two Langdon movies have a bearing on how this newest version is experienced. Most of this new version is quite distinctively and confusingly different in both visual and experiential perspectives and likely would have been much more captivating as a new stand-alone movie unattached to Dan Brown novels. Most of the movie seems to be a collage from the television sustained frenzied action series ""24"" and Nicholas Cages harrowing exploits in National Treasure (2004). Interestingly enough, by the end of the movie though, the Robert Langdon we've come to know is back in a more terrestrially themed version than the prior two incarnations which may for some be a sort of a let down somewhat. Overall, this movie features some innovative and creative photography and the twisting Now You Can See Me (2013) elements. Thrilling, challenging, and surprisingly tender towards the end."
" Read the book. Seriously. This is probably the worst adaptation of all time.
",-0.7003,0.9897,2018-12-21 00:00:00,1,"I didn't have high expectations as such, because I never felt that Hanks could portray Robert Langdon. The Da Vinci Code already proved that, so out of curiosity, I suggest you check that out rather than this, because it's less of an abomination.It's not always productive to compare a book with the movie, and I understand the artistic views and limitations that moving pictures present. There certainly are things you couldn't put on film from the book that create some of the revelations, but this? This is not the story you're looking for.Two key characters are missing entirely, four characters are portrayed more like an insult to their depth, one is completely made up and the most thrilling things about this magnificent story are fast-forwarded and simplified to the point that I can't even understand who'd enjoy it. This is not me ranting about Tom Bombadil not being in LotR, this is the rare occasion where I need to say it out publicly; please, for the love of all that is good, read the book. It's seriously good and with a relevant point. It also doesn't portray world so black and white, and will probably pique your interest in Dante Alighieri. The story is culturally significant and I enjoy the way Dan Brown makes the 'what if' - leaps. But that's all only in the book. Everything that's good in Inferno, is not found here.This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, biased by the fact that the original story is good, but enforced by the fact that the story isn't even the same. It's a random movie, not Dan brown's 'Inferno' by a long shot.Sincerely annoyed that I even watched it."

Not only the producers completely ruined the plot, but they also changed some minor details which could have been easily realised (this would have been appreciated by a book fan).
The movie is also terrible for a person who hasn't read the book at all - most things are very poorly explained and confusing, as the action moves on unnaturally fast.
I found the acting rather bad and artificial, the romance between Robert and Elizabeth was forced, and the character development and the viewer's understanding of their reasoning didn't seem to matter too much to the producers.
I would have appreciated more of the details on history and arts that Dan Brown is known for, as they were (almost) non-existent in the film.
Finally, the movie totally destroyed the story's potential - there were no cliffhangers or shocking twists that would have existed if it had followed the book a little bit closer. Plus, the completely changed ending was dull and not interesting or surprising at all."
" Spectacular visuals and a fine cast do not overcome the frenzied, confusing plot
",-0.0258,0.8748,2018-12-19 00:00:00,7,"In the third installment of the Robert Langdon series from Dan Browns novels, Robert (Tom Hanks) wakes up in an Italian hospital with a head wound and short-term amnesia. A doctor, Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) tries to comfort him and explain he will likely recover and that she met him long ago, when she was nine. It seems she loves puzzles and ciphers. All too soon, there is an assassin trying to capture or kill Langdon, with the courageous doctor helping him escape. At her personal apartment, Dr. Brooks tries to help Robert remember where he was when he was wounded and who could be after him. At times, Dr. Langdon has horrendous visions of fires, chaos, and wounded people. However, he can't remember the small details. Soon, the duo has to go on the run again and more folks seem to be after Langdon. Their journey takes them to some of most prestigious museums and venues in Italy, where clues lead to more venues. Coming back in pieces, Robert's memories return. All of the puzzles are connected to a wealthy businessman, Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foaster), who recently committed suicide. His websites still spout his beliefs that society is doomed without a way to reduce the world population and his bizarre theories to help in attaining this goal. In turn, these ideas are also part in part to Dante's work of Inferno. Can Dr Langdon and Dr. Brooks escape with their lives and solve the potential threat to mankind, even with betrayals on various sides? This film, based on a book by Dan Brown, has a twisting, frenzied plot that is hard to follow and, sometimes, hard to accept. Yet, the visuals are stunning and the sets are from some of the most beautiful cities in Italy. Also, Hanks, Jones, Iffran Kahn, Foster, and others do fine work in complicated roles. If you are a fan of Brown's books and Hanks, by all means, view this one as well. Be prepared, however, for a somewhat underwhelming experience."
" How can Dan Brown allow this to happen?!
",0.2942,-0.5673,2018-12-04 00:00:00,3,In the beginning you might excuse the fact that the movie is deviating from the book but with every other minute watching it gets more painful. I truly ask myself the question how the author Dan Brown can allow this to happen to his controversial story in the book? I think anyone who has read the book will agree that changing the storyline in such a way is an attack on the intellect of society. Do those people really believe that a moviegoer cannot handle an end which is not happily whitewashed? I had my personal Inferno watching this adoption. No Tom Hanks in the world can make up for this...

Indeed, this 'thriller' is perhaps one of the least thrilling in its genre, a glorified A-to-B puzzle-solver which the audience isn't really asked to participate in and they're always two steps ahead of (making any participation essentially moot, anyway). It's also quite silly, to boot, ultimately making this fairly bargain-bin fodder that's apparently based off of an 'intelligent' book (though I haven't read it, so I wouldn't know) but actually only toes the line of competency for most of its duration. Perhaps it could provide some passing entertainment if you just let it take you and 'don't think about it' (essentially just stare at the screen), but where's the fun in that? 5/10"

I kept delaying watching Inferno because of the bad reviews I heard but now since I watched it, I can confirm.First of all, this had horrible casting choices. All the female actresses were very dull. The plot is so messy and all over the place. It was hard to catch on in the first 45 mins -the whole visions and memory loss thing- and it got to the point of it being boring, I've never experienced such a feeling with a Howard film. The twist wasn't even that shocking or good, the previous installments had way more shock value. Also, Zimmer's music is great as usual but not phenomenal, also compared to the other previous two.Tom Hanks gave a good performance as usual but Langdon's did little to zero problem solving and riddles in here, this is what we love about Langdon and it was just not there. It lacked that element of excitement we had specially in Angels and Demons. Moreover, the whole Sinskey x Langdon romance was not needed at all.Now the ending, the Cistern part was actually very visually appealing, I loved the colors and the music went very well with it, yet it was not epic, it would've been done way better. Moreover, Why does everything has go rainbow and sweet with Hollywood. The novel's ending was miles better. I mean there were no mass killings, the majority would be infertile, that would have left the audience talking about it even after they leave the theater for days. The message was lost.

Hanks is undoubtedly the best thing about this movie; he really gives it his best shot and does his best throughout, but there's no denying that the writing is weak and the plotting largely ridiculous. Essentially this is a complicated chase thriller with Hanks and his buddy Felicity Jones on the run from the WHO and a sinister assassin, while at the same time trying to prevent an outbreak of the plague. There's less focus on mystery-solving and riddles here and more on the action, which is okay. Jones, unfortunately, gives a horrible performance that it's impossible to take seriously, while other solid actors like Ben Foster and Irrfan Khan don't have much to do. This is better than the awful DA VINCI CODE but not as mildly enjoyable as ANGELS & DEMONS."

It lacks the number of clues to be found in A&D and DVC but this is no bad thing as the film might have become as formulaic as Dan Brown's books tend to be.

The female co-pilot in this film, as each story has had one, is Felicity Jones as Sienna Brooks. Waking up in a 'hospital' with 'amnesia' Langdon has to solve the mystery of his lost memory while working on the mystery of solving a modified version of Dante's ""Inferno"", which will help them uncover a global terrorist plot created by billionaire Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster). Having no memory makes it difficult for Langdon to know what lead him here, what's happened and what coffee is called. Twists and turns, high adrenaline, book-smart sleuthing, with a little more paranoia than before. This film really had a lot of potential, more so than the other films - it's darker, has potentially bigger fatality risks for humanity and it has a lot of unexpected twists. Unfortunately I found this to be the weaker of the three films pumped out so far. Dialogue and reasoning was occasionally stupid. Intentions and motives were sign posted. The bad guy is really the good guy and the good guy is really the bad guy - a staple for these Dan Brown films. It's all been done and is a bit tired. The main change was that the riddles and clues weren't marked out as obviously for the audience, in fact they were glossed over pretty quickly as if they didn't really matter - if you've watched the film, think back - what was Dante's map of hell there to point out - most people probably won't remember without it taxing their thoughts for some time. This was a theme - rather than look at the puzzles it was more a case of being a chase film. What happened to the end of the film too? Avid book readers will know that this is not how the book ended - it looks like director and producers wanted their own version of the end to make the film fall in line with Hollywood - nothing gets answered or resolved - the issue of overpopulation, which is a central theme to the movie, is still there at the end. It hasn't been looked at, hasn't been solved - it's all as it was when the film started. A little let down, 5 out of 10. Not awful, but definitely not great either. I don't think there will be many more of these now - this trilogy seems to have gotten worse in all aspects, from directions to cast delivery, from scenery on view, to performances, from story telling to plot twists."

Major plot twists are poorly explained at best, and at worst are awkward and ill-fitting and in satisfying thriller. The entire need for Langdon (Tom Hanks) seems pointless and silly. Meanwhile, the attempt to release a virus to reduce the world's population seems pointless when the chief beneficiary commits suicide.Langdon's love interest sub plot also sinks with lack of credibility or authenticity. . . The entire film looks like an early draft that was never given the much needed rewrites to bring the plot up to the same high level as the impressive scenery and beautiful filming.My 3/10 is solely to give credit to the scenery and filming. If you feel inclined to watch this . .

" ""Memento"" starring Robert Langdon
",0.0,0.882,2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Ok, so here's another review where I have to begin by saying that I have not read this book. Anyway, this movie is basically what would happen if someone made the movie ""Memento"" with Robert Langdon as the main character.The story is essentially told backwards, with the audience receiving the answers first and the questions later. There's nothing wrong with this, and, in fact, nonliner storytelling can be very interesting. I always cite ""Pulp Fiction"" as an example of this. No, the problem with this film isn't how the story is told. The problem with this film is the story.Said story is rather bloated and unnecessarily convoluted with characters popping in and out for no reason and the whole thing not being as focused as the previous film in this series, ""Angels and Demons.""The direction is also at fault here. The whole thing is pieced together in a way that is rather meandering and slow, a rather odd choice for a story taking place over the course of only a couple days. The score is very standard and shockingly forgettable, considering it was composed by the amazing Hans Zimmer, one of the greatest film composers working today.The characters are mostly generic and boring, with the exception of a couple. Robert Langdon is still great. Tom Hanks has yet to give a bad performance and he does the best he can with this material considering the fact that he's somewhat confused and forgetful for most of the runtime. In addition, Irfan Kahn is his usual awesome self, portraying a character that is somewhat interesting. Felicity Jones should also be commended for giving her all to a character that is rather run of the mill, save for a halfway decent twist.It isn't horrible, though. The story is still fairly investing, and once Robert Langdon is back to his old self, his knowledge proves entertaining. It's simply not put to proper use here.All in all, this is a fairly forgettable excursion that doesn't really add anything to the Robert Langdon character. It doesn't deserve to be thrown into the inferno, but it also doesn't belong with the angels."

We live and die with a span of 75 plus minus years (excluding illnesses). Are we over populated? Yes, according to experts. Can the planet feed us all? Yes to a certain point. But the point at the end of the day is, how do we control over population?
I have no children. I lost a set of twins at 11 weeks after a rough trip through ivf. Sad story, sport version: My better half suffered through a rough patch of sterilisation due to illness as a teen. Sad, but let's move on in the dull storyline (boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy can't have kids. We adopt and we have grandkids now and we have cats). Someone has probably had an unwanted (what a word, and it can be multiplied) child that has a need to be adopted in order to ""fill the need"" of an adult with no kids (Two please. We now have 3 healthy grandkids. None of them look like us, but love is all around us.)
The concept of overpopulation and the solution of sterilisation is neither the question nor the answer. It's a tonic about control and a possible solution. We humans have relative control, let's face it. For instance, I am the youngest of 14 born and 9 alive kids from the same father (I am thankfully the last and only from his wife nr. 3. The other 2 wifes are dead ). Seriously, what is wrong with the world?
So what is needed here? Biblically speaking, there were only 2 people when Genesis 1:28 ""Be fruitful and many. Fill the Earth and subdue it"" was said out loud.
Therefore, the movies agenda is both interesting and scary at the same time. What if you couldn't?
Alas, it's a movie like any other, with a hint of, ""I wouldn't like that"" but if you've watched Alien, Elm street or Misery, would you like that thought. in your mind? (Those movies scored high)"

Even profesor Langdon realizes that maybe sterilizing half the population of the world however cruel, was probably the right choice in the end.

They've decided to shoot this very differently with constant moving/shaking camera and the editing is so fast paced that there is no sense of being there at all. It's a mind boggling choice, because to me a lot of what makes this kind of movies good is the detachment of your daily surroundings and ""visiting"" all the gorgeous places they go to. Churches, palaces, museums, different countries. The cinematography is so damn ugly in this movie that it really makes me wonder what the hell were they thinking.

Langdon is being assisted by his fan doctor Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones). Seasoned and casual viewers both can figure things out by an early clue.As far as puzzle solving, the film is a let down from previous films, but if you like chase scenes with hype music that sounds like a lame version of ""Midnight Express"" this one fits that description. Entertainment has resorted to chase scenes instead of something intellectual.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."

After watching the 2 previous films I had very high hopes for the 3rd installment, but........ Again I won't spoil it for those who have not seen the film, but our hero (and in this he is, especially the end sequence) manages to recall the most minute details even though he is experiencing memory loss. The companion from the start was just too perfect and I knew instantly (oops I nearly gave the game away). All in all watchable but nowhere as good as the previous 2, in fact I will say I was let down. By far the worst part of the film were the scenes featuring the Asian Private Security guy.

" actively harmful
",0.3182,-0.8369,2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Since I'm a mortal and thus unable to spare infinite amounts of time, I haven't read the Dan Brown book this movie is based on. By way of educated guess I would say that this is a fairly faithful adaptation, since everything screams Dan Brown : an implausible premise, weird conspiracies involving fanatics and assassins, bizarre minions cropping up all over the place, lots and lots of explosions, lots and lots of pursuits, untimely excursions into Art History 101 or the touristic treasures of the Mediterranean Area. Another typical trait : a time bomb, neatly labeled for your convenience.And of course there is the usual incompetent twaddle about symbolololology : no franchise can do without.The plot holes are beyond counting. The main one is serious enough to capsize the ship all on its own. If you are a misanthropic lunatic obsessed with the population explosion and environmental degradation, and if you are able to get your hands on a deadly virus, why not use the virus immediately ? Or if you fear that you will be unable to perform the work yourself, why not leave clear instructions to your collaborators along the lines of ""This is the exact hiding place of the object : go there and open the vial"" ? Why would anyone want to pile riddle upon riddle, or organize a magical mystery tour along the most stunning works of art of Italy and Turkey ? Talking about riddles, it is a mystery to me why fine artists like Sy, Knudsen or Hanks give themselves the permission to participate in tripe like this. Yes, yes, there are mountains - Himalayas - of cash involved, but surely there must be other projects providing a nice fee ? Who knows, perhaps someone was kind enough to give them an injection, afterwards, which induced retrograde amnesia.Or there may be some kind of ""Ipcress file"" brainwashing going on : ask these people where they were during the shooting and they'll go ""kkksst-krr-kssst-errgl"".The problem is that ""Inferno"" isn't just an annoying and obnoxious movie, it crosses the line where it becomes actively dangerous.Dan Brown may be honestly convinced of the dangers of overpopulation but if so, he chooses a most perverse way of showing his concern. The movie tells the story of a misanthropic eccentric who wants to ""cull"" the human population. This is not miles removed from suggesting that everyone worried about overpopulation is, by definition, a misanthropic eccentric seething with blood lust - especially if one takes into account the current cultural climate, where fact, reason and civic discourse have been snowed under by propaganda, wishful thinking and conspiracy theories. The sad results are here : think, for instance, of the vast number of people who do not ""believe"" in climate change, as if this were a matter of belief and not of facts. Also deeply disquieting : the large number of people who are willing to gobble any exciting nonsense, as long as there are enough explosions and pursuits, but who can't be arsed to read a serious report on a serious environmental issue. Dan Brown, a purveyor of cheap conspiracy theories and brainless thinking if there ever was one, contributes merrily to the confusion. The same can be said of the various makers of this movie."
" 'Inferno' falls short on adapting the bestselling mystery novel
",0.3182,0.9946,2017-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Having skipped 'The Lost Symbol', Ron Howard takes command of the fourth Dan Brown novel in the Robert Langdon franchise, 'Inferno', but still seems content to operate on autopilot when we know he's capable of better. Simply put, the director is at odds with the source material, his talents unsuited to what's demanded here. Robert Langdon awakes in a hospital in foreign destination with amnesia, people are either trying to have him killed or captured, and disturbing visions plague his reawakening. The plot moves fast, hopping from one destination to the next, and as a fan of the book, its undeniably fun seeing events brought to life on the big screen, especially with Tom Hanks in the lead and Hans Zimmer composing the music. Whereas the others in the series serve as a 24-hour treasure hunt, 'Inferno' substitutes the treasure for a deadly virus, making the stakes higher whilst also making our protagonist deal with enemies at every turn. The bestselling mystery novel is laced with intricate plotting, double-dealing characters, and historical exposition, serving as much as a worthwhile history lesson as it is a well formed action thriller, with plenty of twists, turns, and dynamic misdirection. You move from one stunning location to another, following a trail of clues and uncovering the mystery one puzzle piece at a time. As a film adaptation though, 'Inferno' struggles to extract the page-turning intricacies, incapable of applying a lot of the interesting sections of the novel, and overall doesn't translate well to movie format. It also diverges heavily in the latter stages, and book fans will find it hard not to feel underwhelmed when character motivations differ so greatly, and the plot alters so suddenly (particularly the ending). 'Inferno' manages to turn the complex into the contrived, becoming convoluted in trying to be as clever as the book. But despite my negativity, I still found enough enjoyment in the two hour run-time believe it or not, with a main villain that makes a thought-provoking point about overpopulation. The film just warranted a better screenplay and stronger direction as we traipse through Dante's Inferno, visions and all.7/10"
" Overly complicated and ridiculous plot
",-0.3612,0.1695,2017-08-02 00:00:00,2,"I added a star (or two) based solely upon the actors trying to make the most of a just god awful plot. I am surprised Tom Hanks didn't walk away from this mess, but I guess even the rich and famous can't turn down a fat paycheck. I didn't read the novel, so I have no idea whether the book is as bad as the screenplay. I love a good mystery, and enjoy twists and turns, but there was no intelligence employed with same in this movie. With regard to the movie plot, it seems that the villain, with all his resources good have devised a much simpler and effective means of deploying the doomsday virus. Seems he could have simply dropped the bag out of helicopter over any large metropolitan area, absent all the complexities employed with inclusion of the Dante's Inferno complexities. This movie reminded me of the overly complex methods by which villains would attempt to put and end to James Bond in the early movies, thereby providing him with multiple opportunities to escape his demise, when they should have just put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. At least with the Bond movies, they were not intended to be taken seriously. Guess what, I've changed my mind and have changed my rating to only two stars."
" The Third Robert Langdon Film Is About Dante
",0.0,0.983,2017-07-30 00:00:00,7,"I have read almost all of Dan Brown's novels except ""The Lost Symbol"" and ""Inferno"" - the novel that this movie was based on.I have scheduled to read them soon but I decided to watch this film first before proceeding to reading them to see how interesting the story of ""Inferno"" would be.This film adaptation ""Inferno"" stars Tom Hanks as the familiar world-renowned cryptologist and art historian Robert Langdon together with the pretty Felicity Jones,who portrays the British doctor Dr. Sienna Brooks who Langdon is with in search for clues and solving puzzles and riddles.The story revolves around Dante's Inferno.Langdon and Brooks come to search for the virus that was created by Bertrand Zobrist,a billionaire geneticist who is passionate about Dante, to decimate the world's population.It was shown that Zobrist have committed suicide after he was chased by government agents.It is now up to Langdon to solve puzzles and riddles involving Dante to locate the virus and to stop it from killing billions of people.As they do that,they also must elude people who are trying to stop them like those people aligned with Zobrist.After watching this film directed by Ron Howard,it was obvious that the viewer is stuck again to the familiar Robert Langdon elements that were present in ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angel And Demons"".As I have said,the pretty woman is present in Sienna after having Sophie in ""The Da Vinci Code"" and Vittoria in ""Angels and Demons"".Then we have the riddles and clues of antiquity and art history.Instead of talking about Christianity and Christian history in the first two movies particularly Jesus and the Vatican,we now have those that involves Dante Alighieri.As always,we have quality music coming from Hans Zimmer and great production settings as we get to see the beautiful city of Florence.And as usual,Tom Hanks provides us a nice performance of Langdon and Felicity Jones is a great presence.But in spite of these positive qualities,the story no doubt is not really as interesting as the last two Robert Langdon movies especially those who are searching for more knowledge about history.This was more of a character-driven movie especially for both Langdon and Brooks.Also,the story was definitely contrived - as always - considering Dan Brown isn't there to tell a realistic story but to teach people about history.Too bad that there was also lack of tension as the viewers was somewhat made to forget the dangers of the virus that it presents to the world's population. The film made an assurance that it will be found by the protagonist before the end credits rolls.Many reviewers have complained about the film opting for a happy ending as some of the changes made compared to the book.As always,Hollywood - unlike Korean films - will always opt for a happy ending.It disappointed many who have read the book upon seeing this film.But nevertheless,this third film of the Robert Langdon film series was definitely the least interesting as compared to the first two - with or without that change.It was obvious that Dante isn't as rich in history compared to Christianity."

" Being of one mind
",0.0,0.9562,2017-07-25 00:00:00,6,"It often is a losing proposition to expect motion picture adaptations to remain true to their literary source, be it 'Wuthering Heights', 'The Green Mile' or 'Les Miserables'. Yet, some movie scripts have captured successfully the essence of their originals, as 'Sense and Sensibility,' 'All the President's Men' or 'The Merchant of Venice' did. And then we have the three Dan Brown movies, arguably lesser fare, indeed. Neither of the three, although entertaining to different degrees, also to different degrees meet the necessary challenge. There is in 'The Da Vinci Code' book an abundance of speculative red herrings of conspiracies that might work as fiction on the written page which, but for other than Dan Brown followers, fly in the face of historic fact. In this regard, the movie succeeds - other than the ill-disguised and predictable revelation of its ultimate villain. The premise behind 'Angels and Demons' works better until the outrageous sequence in St. Peter's Square and what follows become a Nancy Drew thriller. With 'Inferno', at some point and for reasons best known to the movie makers involved, a disorienting non-linear narrative was introduced, conveniently distracting audiences from improbable off-screen coincidences (explained away by dialogues from this-or-that character) that in real life could not have taken place in order for diverse conspirators to have infiltrated organizations of both good guys and bad guys. To object to the movie's resolution as unbecoming that of the source book may be accurate; but Dan Brown's book's, while arguably rational, is socially unreasonable. Audiences decry discrimination, genocide, authoritarianism and the xenophobia that the arts denounce and portray; they should be consistent in their priorities and expectations. Review of 'The Handmaid's Tale' (1990) by commentator 'realreel' reminds us of how the movie ""...represents the best kind of literary adaptation that the cinema offers: One in which the screenwriter and director clearly remained faithful to the spirit of the book without attempting to reproduce it..."" The spirit, he says, should be our priority. 'The Da Vinci Code' 7/10 'Angels and Demons' 6/10 'Inferno' 6/10"

This Hanks hopes to accomplish by piecing together a less-than- mind-boggling assortment of clues gleaned from Dante's ""Inferno.""Despite a screenplay by David Koepp and direction by Ron Howard, this is a depressingly dull and unimaginative mystery tale, stocked with paper-thin characters and paint-by-numbers plot twists.

Forget the ending, those people are so obsessed by the ending of the book (which was as trivial as the one of the movie). I didn't like the movie because it didn't have the intensity and the thrill the book had from beginning to end. The modifications they made were all bad decisions all along. The worst part is that Dan Brown must have approved the movie script while knowing that it would mess up the original story of the book."

There is a tendency in films when bad guys are finally deemed to be good and the reverse is true, the picture becomes heavy handing, muddled and outright confusing.The global plot to infect the world has long been a plot in films, but the confusion that results here is amazing to say the least.How the female doctor who aids our professor hero Tom Hanks and then it is determined that she was the lover of the film's culprit is not only mesmerizing, but downright incredible to believe."

The confused opening features an old man awaking in hospital in severe pain. The audience does not see this old man as a hero -- which is what the producers were hoping -- but rather as someone they would like to rescue and put in Motel 6 until he feels better. Instead everyone on the planet is trying to kill him and he does not remember why? Wait, let's insult the intelligence of the audience even more shall we? Let's pretend this confused old man, who seems to be in the wrong movie or possibly wandered onto the wrong set, forms some sort of bond with the otherwise delightful Felicity Jones, who is old enough to be his grand-daughter. She is not of course, but if she actually were, she would have taken the old man to a Motel 6 and saved us all from the horror that is this movie.For those that think this review is not positive enough, here is a positive thought. Hopefully this ended the franchise."

Mainly the purpose of the virus was to cause sterilization, not to kill people and that the virus does get released. That idea sounds better than what we got. The plot to the movie is like a James Bond story, with a crazy guy that wants to kill millions. As per these films, the professor uses his knowledge of Dante to solve a couple of puzzles, all the while being followed by WHO. And in what was a really bad plot twist, his side kick, Sienna, is really working against him. Another change from the book.FINAL VERDICT: OK puzzle mystery, just a dumb bad guy"

The whole story made sense because of the twist in the end and they choose to leave that behind? For what? So that it will not hurt the fragile sensitivities of typical Hollywood public? I have NEVER in my life gave a movie such a low rating but I am compelled since I was so terribly disappointed on what they did. The only reason I am even giving a two is because they didn't at least cheapened out at the locations or anything. The acting was pretty horrible. Even a web series have better acting than this. Tom hanks looked tired and he is not even trying anymore. They took out some major things out but that's fine since even then it became 2 hours long but what I am mad about most is the ending. I never expected this from Ron Howard. Like really didn't."
" Terrible movie
",-0.4767,-0.9905,2017-06-12 00:00:00,2,"First of all I have to say that I read the book the film was based on. The book was quite good and fast and interesting. This film has nothing to do with the book. It is totally different, different characters, different ending. I know that it is hard to adapt a book on just one film but this was outrageous. Let's forget about the book for a moment. Let's talk about the film itself. Tom Hanks seems really tired in this movie.He seems reluctant to act.The woman who portrayed Siena , makes it quite obvious that she is involved with the guy who made inferno virus. She doesn't even hide it. And in the end she is portrayed as a total psychopath who wants to kill so many people for the good of humanity, whilst in the book she is actually helping Robert Langton to get to the virus.And in the book the virus is actually active and it is not a killing virus, it is an infertility virus. This idea is what makes the book different. That Zobrist did not want to kill people, he wanted to make a random part of the population infertile in order to reverse the expansion of population. Lacking this element, the movie is just another story of a maniac who wants to destroy the world and the hero saves the world just in time before disaster is unleashed. So the movie has a very ordinary plot, the characters are underdeveloped,the added characters are irrelevant, acting is poor and directorship is poor too because it fails to carry you away with nice sceneries where the action takes place. It fails to picture Florence, Venice, Istanbul in a way that you actually forget about how miserable this film is."

I don't know why they skipped that book from adapting which was done in the last minutes by the production house. My guess is it might be a controversial as the first one, or simply not good enough for the cinematic version. Anyway, this film was not as good as previous two. Once again, it was directed by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks returned as professor Robert Langdon. Two hours long, but very fast storytelling, non-stop adventures.This is another tale in the series about fighting against the men who believes in the ancient text that's written about to curb the issue the human would face in the future, which is now. After waking up without any memory, professor Langdon with the help of a young woman escape from an assassin. In result, they look for the reason why and whoever behind it wants them dead. So it's not a good story, but entertaining film. Especially if you like action-adventure- suspense.Nice cast, including Hanks and Jones. The other supporting cast was not bad either. Like always, it's a European adventure, particularly in Venice and neighbouring countries. Some cool secret places, might be the settings, but awesome. Since this part was not received well, I wonder the next one, 'Origin' would be made or not. Even before that, this time I expect 'The Lost Symbol' first to hit if they want to continue with the film series. This is not a film to recommend, but not bad for watching it once.6/10"

""The DaVinci Code"" was a great hit and ""Angels & Demons"" didn't do bad either, sadly the same cannot be said about Inferno.The movie lacks what their predecessors had: originality, creativity and cultural value. Yes, what you learn in the first two films wasn't entirely true, but nonetheless you learnt something while enjoying it. In here you learn nothing. If it wasn't based on the book it could be a normal action, thriller movie. A movie just to enjoy your time in front of the screen and then forgetting at all about it, with plain characters that at some point you might get confused on why are they doing what are doing. Tom Hanks, of course, is a great actor and he is in the company of Felicity Jones, one of the actresses of the moment, and it is really a pity how their performances cannot save this movie, making it a bit dull and forgetful.Yes, there is action, a non-stop action like we always find in movies based in Dan Brown's work, but it is just that. Nothing big enough or interesting enough to keep our brains connected to the movie; just things that come and go. Like in the previous movies, when everything happens in a rush, one thing after another, but in here when they go from one point to the next they don't feel that well-connected, like there isn't a major purpose to all this madness, there a not so many riddle or mystery as before, in there it is something more common and later on in the movie, when you learn the truth, you might feel really disappointed with all of it.""Inferno"" is actually the fourth out of four books, but the movie was made before ""The Lost Symbol"" because the book was a bestseller, as it happened with ""The DaVinci Code"" years ago that was made before ""Angels & Demons"", although the second comes before the first. There are way many important differences with the book and the most important one is the end, which I won't spoil, but personally I like much more the end of the book, more realistic I would say, just as a clue: it is the other side of the coin than in the movie. Another thing that they have changed is the female character, in the movie is more flat than in the book and her purpose is nothing special, just someone more, which is just a pity because in the book it is a wonderful one.If you have read the book you probably won't like the movie, like the author of this review; but on the other hand, if you haven't read it, you might like the movie.

If you are a Dan Brown fan, then i suggest not watching this movie because it will shatter your hopes"

I read this book and it was one of the best books I've ever read.

It is Tom Hanks we are talking about here. But what was the director thinking???? WHY ON EARTH would you ruin a brilliant ending? Why? Just for the sake of not getting rage from Christians and such? People need to wake up. Stop giving fake movies and start bringing reality into perspective. Wold IS changing and everyone needs to stop and listen.

The suspense was which was there in the novel is not at all present in the movie. I felt the whole concept was changed.

During the whole movie you hop from clue to clue trying to solve the enigma. You know beforehand that he will save the planet from another catastrophe so I'm not spoiling anything with that because it's always like that. The other two movies were better though, there is no doubt about that. I also read that apparently they changed the end of the movie compared to the book. Why you would do such a stupid thing is ridiculous. Just stick to the book if you make a movie based on it. And for sure if the ending in the book was better. The cast is good for this movie. They all play their cat & mouse characters like they should. There are a couple of twists but not as good as in The Da Vinci Code.

Didn't know what the story was about and a few minutes into the movie realised it was the Da Vinci franchise. A few years ago can remember being captivated by the book and entertained by the movie.Unfortunately Inferno certainly wasn't captivating or entertaining. Neither of the leads (Hanks is joined by the normally excellent Felicity Jones) seemed that interested in the movie which wasn't surprising given the clunky dialogue. About 45 minutes into the movie I was extremely bored, so decided not to waste any more time on the movie. Maybe the movie picked up in the second half, but very much doubt it."

Sadly this movie is one of those that is not good at all.Where was the suspense and cleverness associated with Dan Brown's novels? I have not read this book but from what others have said it seems that they changed quite a lot, including the ending, which is maybe why it was so lacking.All I can say positively is that it is a watchable movie but not one that moves you in any way. Too much emphasis on Robert Langdon's flashbacks and imaginations and not enough plot. I pretty much guessed the main twist in the story long before it happened. Sadly this was a lost opportunity."

This adaptation introduces various plot holes and non-existent characters. Worse still, it completely changes the attitudes, characteristics, verbiage, and even actions of the existent characters.The book was riveting, shocking, and completely revolutionary in ingenuity, style, twist, and thought-provoking power. The movie, on the other hand, descended to typical, predictable, and downright boring.

The movie itself was not entirely bad, hence I am not rating less than 6 out of 10, but whoever decided to completely change the ending should not be in this line of business. The ending presented by Dan Brown was thoughtful and an incredibly important twist. Replacing it with a general happy ending is not just a bad idea, it takes away the brilliancy behind the movie. The brilliance of the antagonist Zobrist. Being portrayed as an insane man trying to kill half of the population does not live up to the character described by Dan Brown, not even closely."

There were no doubt some a-ha effects but what concerned the cinematography quality it let some wishes left. I found the first two movies of this trilogy much more better than this. I think only Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones delivered here a solid performance. I hope the next one will be done with more care and cleverness. 6/10.If you like this genre of film I recommend the both The National Treasure with Nicolas Cage.

What frightens me is the likelihood of those among us viewers who are just mentally unstable enough to consider any kind of mass murder, including those nefariously conceived by terrorist groups and homicidal dictators, to actually be justifiable atrocities based on the false assumption that a generalized reduction in our planet's population is always a good thing. Do we really need another Hitler to emerge in our midst and remind us that each and every human personality is a unique gift to our racially diverse society bestowed by our Creator Father in Heaven and therefore represents an irreplaceable part of our evolving cosmic destiny in time and space as well as when viewing things through the eternal perspective (God's point of view)? A more rational approach to overpopulation would be to limit the pro-creative functioning of conspicuously degenerate and anti-social genetic strains including habitual criminals and mental defectives while simultaneously promoting married man-n-woman couples with advanced intellectual and spiritual endowments to multiply their potential gifts to future generations of humanity by maximizing the number of children conceived and teaching their kids that same philosophy involving an exponential distribution of inherited assets. On a more positive note, at least INFERNO got me to thinking about such perplexing problems and those thoughts are what triggered the writing of this review."

The story itself make no sense, it's just a pretext to have Tom Hanks character back in another movie, the story isn't gritting and doesn't make you stay on the chair, in some moments it's just boring. Don't know why Dan Brown have to find always something mysterious on the Italian literature or art, maybe with Leonardo Davinci you can find something like that something that make you think there is something mysterious...but using DANTE for this movie it's completely out of sight. don't know what happen to Ron Howard but this movie seems really bad directed and bad edited..really bad. Also Tom hanks and all the cast..all of them seems really way behind them potential.

Don't worry, no spoilers here...except that THEY BALLSED IT UP! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!! The major, most critical issue facing the human race, which will, without question, lead to the sort of hell that Dante envisioned, is TOTALLY GLOSSED OVER!

But it got worse. Shaky camera, fast sequences during escape scenes. And then, finally, after 10 minutes into the movie... Langdon on a couch. And even there the camera can not be steady. Never ever seen such a static scene being that shaken up. Constantly camera movements left and right and up and down. Never a fixed focus.I mean, Hardcore:Henry, it features a first person view in a kind of experimental way. You can watch it and still not become sea sick - and enjoy.This is like a drunk doing a YouTube movie.

Unfortunately the finished product was far from great. Firstly, if you have read the book, and not yet seen the film then don't waste your time. However, if you haven't read the book then you may find the movie more more enjoyable. Overall it just felt rushed. I like Tim Hanks (who doesn't?), but I just got the impression from his performance he was there only to fulfill a contractual obligation with the studio rather than embracing the role of Robert Langdon. Also, I'm sure it's no secret they have drastically change the ending, but the finale didn't sit right for Hanks or the character. Having read Inferno and other Langdon stories I don't envisage the character (or Tom Hanks) ever brawling with an eco-terrorist. The highlight of all these books is decoding the secret message hidden amongst Renaissance art. Something that seemed to take a backseat here and let an espionage thriller take the driver's seat. While I was disappointed, it still had its moments. Although as I write this I'm struggling to remember what they were."

" Sadly disappointing, a hollow remnant of the franchise . . .
",-0.7184,0.9734,2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"Somewhat reminiscent of other established franchise series which begin to fade rapidly from the qualities of their origins, this sadly disappointing, latest installment of the Dan Brown series of books translated to film is nothing more than a hollow remnant of what the franchise had once been.Having invested the time to actually watch this, drawn in by the obvious allure of the previous examples of this franchise (DaVinci Code & Angels and Demons), the experience was like being handed a mug filled with cheap table wine after having been previously given quality vintages served in crystal.Where to even begin . . .The concept of this story is not new by any stretch of the imagination.My personal favorite example which somewhat parallels this same theme (but with a vastly more compelling story, series of scenarios and characters) was 12 Monkeys.If anything, this was a sort of clumsily attempted mashup between Davinci Code and 12 Monkeys, maybe . . . but absolutely lacked the depth, compelling intrigue or character development of either.About the only engaging aspect that this film had going for it was the beautiful sets and scenes in Italy. If anything, a marvelous bit of publicity for the Italian tourist industry. Nothing wrong with that, but if I was interested in a travel guide for beautiful historical locales and art in Italy, would rather have spent the time at an actual heritage site devoted to that purpose.Tom Hanks, being the consummate professional actor that he is, did put in the effort, but just wasn't given much to work with. I have considerable respect for Ron Howard and much his previous works, but this was not anywhere near his usual caliber of such.Perhaps it was a combination of bad editing, clumsily arranged scenes, and lack of any real originality or depth of development.Without spending the effort of reciting a laundry list of problems with this production, that summation will suffice.In any case, my recommendation is to stay away from this one, especially if you're a fan of the previous film adaptations of Dan Brown's books. You'll be very sadly disappointed, and it will likely leave a bad taste . . . like a cheap wine.3 stars (I'm being politely generous here)."
" Following Dante
",0.0,0.9956,2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Author Dan Brown has made a tidy sum for himself writing mystery thrillers that are well worth taking the time to read. His plots rely not just on the mystery currently being solved but delve into the past, more often historical or culturally related, to offer a depth to the story many never bother with. Beginning with THE DA VINCI CODE he introduced us to Robert Langdon, a Symbologist (the study of symbols and symbolism) and professor who finds himself the center of a manhunt for a murderer. The symbol involved here was the Holy Grail. Up next was ANGELS AND DEMONS which found Langdon searching for 3 vials located in Vatican City that could spread a plague. Both of these were turned into films starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and have recently been released in 4k version, the highest quality available today.This week Hanks reprises the role of Langdon in the next story from Brown, INFERNO. As you may have guessed the historical phase this time revolves around Dante and the first part of his poem DIVINE COMEDY, more often simply referred to as Dante's Inferno. Langdon wakes in a hospital room handcuffed to the bed and unable to recall much of anything. Talking to his doctor, Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), he learns he is in Florence, Italy. It doesn't take long until he realizes he's a target as well when an assassin dressed as a police officer shows up guns blazing. With the help of Brooks, Langdon escapes.At her apartment the two begin to go through the items Langdon had on him when he checked into the hospital, items Brooks picked up before leaving. Among them he finds a Faraday pointer, a sort of image projector. The image it shows is the maps of Hell as described by Dante and pained by Botticelli. Various clues placed among the picture lead them to realize that this was sent to him by a billionaire named Zobrist (Ben Foster) who we saw leap to his death after a chase in the opening sequence of the film. A warning of a plague virus is there as well and Langdon and Brooks are off and running trying to find it before it can be unleashed.Right behind them are members of WHO, the World Health Organization. They too are trying to figure out just what is going on and to prevent the virus from being unleashed. In addition to their search for Langdon and the virus the assassin continues to pursue him along with a few assist from others.Using the map as a guide Langdon and Brooks travel through the streets of the city to various historical locations in an attempt to decipher the message left for him. It will take them down the back streets of the city, beneath it and into open areas where a well-placed bullet could mean the end for Langdon and the world.As with the previous entries in this film there is a mixture of real and created history on display here that helps to enhance the central story of stopping the virus before it can be released. The back and forth from the historical images of Hell and the pains involved there with the possibility of a worldwide crisis just make the suspense more intense. The clues left behind to be deciphered and only readable by Langdon make his character indispensable. After 3 films we've grown to like this character, to care about him and to sit clutching the arm rest of our chairs as each step puts him in potential danger.At the same time there is a nobility to the character. This isn't his battle, it rarely is, and yet he finds himself in harm's way with no means of escape other than to solve the mystery. But even with that as his reason to be involved you get the impression that to save others he would gladly take on the role of hero. What makes him interesting is that he isn't the muscle bound type or the swaggering wisecracking hero we're used to. Instead we are treated to a hero who uses his mind to find the solution to his problems.Hanks has performed the role to the point I can't imagine anyone else playing Langdon now. Having read all the books I can say that he is a perfect fit for this role. I said a few weeks back writing about SULLY that Hanks is one of the greats when it comes to the world of acting. He does what the best do which is make you forget that you're watching someone act and believe that he is the character he is portraying. Jones does an equally fine job here, not an easy task when you consider she's performing next to Hanks. Her star is on the rise, especially when you couple this film with her turn in STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE.If you like mysteries that make you think and pay attention as they take you on the journey then you won't want to miss this one. It didn't do near the box office that the first two did and honestly might not be quite as good as those two, but it still offers an evening's entertainment well worth the price of rental or even purchase. It's a film that you'll be able to go back and watch more than once and that's saying something. A marathon of all three films might make for a fun weekend."

Its not so much that this has all been done before, it just lacks the pace and tension, you would hope for in a film of this kind. The personal interplay between the key characters is somewhat ""matter of fact"", stunting the emotional impact and sense of surprise, the inevitable conspiracies and double crosses might have made on the viewer.The acting, rather surprisingly, is, in my opinion, not too inspiring either. I personally found most of the performances from the lead characters, rather bland. All in all, watchable but really not what you would expect from a film with this pedigree and budget.

I do not know who is to blame for the entirely new, and quite frankly STUPID retelling of the end of the story, but I found the last chapter to be a total and complete let down, and really quite idiotic! A person would either have to be a total money grubbing whore to think they could re-write Dan Brown, and believe you me they failed miserably.Perhaps i might have given this piece of junk a higher score, (still finding the thing entirely confusing,) if i hadn't already read the book first... but the cat is out of the bag, and i did read the book first, so what can i do?

" Muddled mess without a focus, ridicules a partially interesting premise
",0.3678,-0.8314,2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Playing Robert Langdon was probably one of the poorest choices Tom Hanks in hindsight- and its not just once. It is tough to adapt a Dan Brown book into a movie and tougher to make it likable for its reader. Considering the immense challenge in front of - Ron Howard takes a ridiculous shortcut to disregard any sense the book could have made and ended it up with a senseless cat and mouse chase that neither has the slickness of a thriller nor the intelligence to keep a viewer guessing. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) wakes up at a hospital in Florence with no recollection of his last 48 hours. When a policewoman barges into the hospital and starts shooting her way to Langdon's room, Dr. Sienna (Felicity Jones) who is attending to him and also a fan of Langdon's books helps him escape. While Langdon is trying to comprehend the events, he is more confused with visions of suffering, torture, plague and a woman in the midst of it all. Meanwhile a video of a billionaire Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) who committed suicide a couple of days ago surfaces with content of his plan to solve the current crisis of Planet Earth - over population. It is a race against time for Langdon, Sienna, Harry Sims (Irrfan Khan) - head of a security agency which Bertrand hires, Dr. Elizabeth Sinsky (Sidse Babett Knudsen) of WHO and Christoph Bouchard (Omar Sy) and all with their vested interests. Can they all stop before Mr. Zobrist's plan comes into motion?What this movie lacks desperately is focus. It has got all the technology and cast that top money can buy, but misfires in all directions without hitting any due to complete lack of focus from its director and writers. On one side it is about world population, on another side there is this symbolic reference to Dante's Inferno - a renaissance artist's interpretation of Hell as we know it, then the unpredictable human aspect. On paper, one might think the combination sounds right, but the execution has gone awry. While you trudge through the bore of predictable choices of its characters during its lengthy runtime, it gets even worse to see how dumb and senseless it gets by the end of it. The original plot points which could have made it interesting are thrown off the window and we have a poorly made run-of-the-mill action thriller that deserve neither the budget nor the cast.Just for Tom Hanks credibility sake, I wish Dan Brown holds off on releasing another Robert Langdon book and hopefully 'Lost Symbol' doesn't get the nod. While I agree that Tom Hanks is a slightly over- rated actor, he did feature in some of the most iconic roles and has given memorable performances. The art is not about technicality but how much the roles have affected a viewer that decides their benchmark. While Felicity Jones had a meaty role, I don't think it was well etched out or at least not leveraged to what could have been. Irrfan Khan now seems to be stereotyped in Hollywood as a wise-mouthed sarcastic supporting character (which is rather a better stereotype than most from Indian origin gets a chance to) who dies in every movie.

",-0.296,0.8789,2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"Dan Brown and his works first came to my attention when I read ""The Da Vinci Code"" in 2005. I saw Ron Howard's movie version starring Tom Hanks the following year, and I found it to be a good adaptation. I never got around to seeing ""Angels & Demons"", nor did I read the book. I also never read ""Inferno"". I understand that Ron Howard's movie version of the latter changed a bunch of things. Nevertheless, if the movie is any indication, there's not much point in reading the book. The movie has some interesting stuff about art and history - as well as nice filming locations - but is mostly a mess. The movie seems as if it wants to be a high-action flick. Maybe the novel wasn't like that, but I don't see any point in reading it (especially when I haven't read some of the all-time classics).I assume that the cast will star in something better soon. Whatever they star in is bound to be an improvement."

First, Tom Hanks once act as Forrest Gump for which he won Best Actor in 1995's Academy Awards. I like this person so much because his story is very inspirational to us. Next, this film shock me because the bad guy want to kill half of the people on earth! It's too crazy! This is one of the best movies that I have seen in my entire life! The book of course was fantastic, but unbelievable, the movie is even better! The screenplay is excellent, keeping you engrossed for every single second of the movie.Tom Hanks of course is his very best and one has come to expect nothing less from him, probably the greatest actor of all time."
" Ron Howard is on fire.
",-0.34,0.984,2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,"I have a confession. I liked the Dan Brown books and honestly, I don't really understand the amount of stick they get. He is no Umberto Eco mind you but he is hardly Stephenie Meyer. The other confession? I have not liked the movie adaptations.The first was one was okay mind you but Angel's and Demons was the kind of train wreck that really requires Mike and the robots to enjoy.Hope springs eternally and while director Ron Howard has certainly had some misses recently star Tom Hanks is always a dependable watch. I was expecting a decent movie and got a surprisingly good one. Even more shocking Ron Howard's direction is one of the strengths this time.First off though let me get this out of the way. The story is pulpy illogical nonsense. The twist in the middle can be seen from space and the twist, in the end, makes absolutely zero sense. (Still better than Angels and Demons Illuminati scavenger hunt, however.) What works though is the visuals. Ron Howard creates visions of hell that are actually effective and creative. The travelogue element is beautiful and unlike Angels and Demons (God I hated that movie) it is in daylight so one can actually see and enjoy the scenery. (Angels and Demons didn't have permission to film in the Vatican so a lot of the scenes were at night, in the rain with all the lights turned off to hide this fact.)As for the cast, Irrfan Khan steals every scene he is in, Tom Hanks is dependable as usual. Sidse Babett Knudsen is dull and has zero chemistry with her costars, Omar Sy almost gives an OJ Simpson Naked gun performance that seems like it should be in a Pink Panther film, and Felicity Jones does that pixie eyes thing so all is forgiven there (No actress could really make her character work so she gets points for looking cute while flailing around.)Overall a fun film with surprisingly good visuals, some decent performances, and a silly story. Grab some popcorn."

The plot is terrible and does not make any sense at all regardless of the end.The movie end makes more sense for the movie story, which is a totally different story from the book. Even though uses the same concept, I can say that this is no adaptation from the book, besides some of the characters names (not even the characters description was the same as the book).If the intention was to release the virus, there was no need for ""seek and find"". The virus was to be released anyway.There is no possible explanation for the people wanting to release the virus to use somebody to look for it and eventually try to stop the threat.Dumbest story ever!"

Then as you sit down to watch the film, with all of your hopes and expectations, suddenly you feel a punch in your gut. Well, not quite literally, but utter disappointment causes that feeling.Even if you consider the movie as an independent entity, besides the novel, there's still no coherency in the plot. The characters have no definition, their development are not defined, the key motive is not clear, and the story just rushes from one scene to next without any precursor. The core concept is so deep and thought-provoking, it deserves a good amount of explanation to the viewer.The pandemonium of characters and scenes diffuses the intensity of the core story. There could have been wonders with Tom Hanks as the lead. The characters of Sienna and Elizabeth Sinskey are all over the place- confusing and misleading. All in all, very disappointing experience with the film! Leaves a feeling that novels should just remain novels and not translated into audio visual. It's not just to the author."

What a disappointment when I can see everything's being original in the book become the most hypothetical Hollywood script... Not that I felt the movie story to be 100% in accordance with the book, but I was expecting some details to be set aside like Harry Potter movies, you know...

" 'The greatest sins in human history were committed in the name of love.'
",0.5106,0.9069,2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Dan Brown has made a fortune on his thrillers with secrets hidden in art books and this latest screen adaptation continues the flavor of his concept that started with The Da Vinci Code, then Angels and Demons, and now Inferno. He has a formula that works cinematically (with a screenplay by David Koepp) and if this current adaptation isn't quite p to par the blame is shifted to director Ron Howard and the excessive use of CGI effects that move the drama away from the close tie to art and literature of ancient Italy. Still it is Dan Brown, and he knows how to spin a tale.Set very solidly in contemporary times we first meet the character Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) and his plan to control the overpopulation of the earth with a diabolical release of a new virus that infect the masses and reduce the population to 50 % of its present status. Enter the famous symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia and finds himself the target of a manhunt. Langdon teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), an ER doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to stop a madman from unleashing a global virus that would wipe out half of the world's population. The World Health Organization is involved as are spies and the usual bad guys ‚Äì with several prominent roles played by Sidse Babett Knudsen (Robert's ex-lover), Omar Sy, Irrfan Khan, Ana Ularu, Ida Darvish, among others.The beauty of the film is the magnificence of Florence, Italy, Istanbul, Turkey, Budapest, Hungary, and Venice, Italy and of course the artwork that plays so significant a part in the mystery of the hunt for the container of 'The Virus.' The story has been doctored unnecessarily, weakening it is many ways from the book, but the thrust is there ‚Äì and Tom Hanks once again pulls it off well. INFERNO may not be perfect but it is a fine evening's entertainment ‚Äì with some significant commentary about power and population control and the environment tossed in for controversy."

It is believed that some of those chasing Langdon will find the virus and sell it to the highest bidder. Oh, no!!The first 10-minutes or so are quite intense with many disturbing images so I wouldn't let small children watch. I had to turn my head away a couple times. (Actually more like 20-times) This is, of course, a chase movie. I don't think any scene lasted more than 5-seconds for more than the first half of the movie. It was like the Director and the cast were on roller-skates to beat some time limit. After that, the scenes became more relaxed and one could finally breathe normally. There are many, twists and turns in here and when you think you know something, you are surprised, okay, maybe shocked when you find out differently. I know I was completely shocked by one of those twists. (Only one?)Notables: Omar Sy as Bouchard one of the persons from W.H.O chasing Langdon; Sidse Babett Knudsen as Elizabeth an official with the W.H.O. organization; and Irrfan Khan as Harry Sims who got the police to chase Langdon. I must say Irrfan Khan reminded me a lot of Christopher Walken as he had the facial expressions and delivery Walken sometimes gives.

When they are translated into actions by real people, as in the films of the books, the result is laughable. I can't understand how the actors in this film can have kept a straight face while they delivered the ridiculous lines. My hunch is that they all had a good laugh after each scene was filmed. None of the actors seems to have their heart in the film. Even Tom Hanks gives a wooden and unconvincing performance. A large sum of money must have been spent shooting this film, recouped no doubt by the hype of publicity surrounding it. But the result is absolute unbelievable rubbish.

" It's Deja-Vu all Over again, or Is It Deja-da Vinci/Deja-Dante? Weakest of the Robert Langon Films Is Still Entertaining
",-0.1027,-0.9936,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I guess because it would be redundant to call it ""The Dante Code"", Dan Brown called it ""Inferno"". However, it essentially parallels much of what we saw in ""The Da Vinci Code"". Instead of Da Vince it's Dante and all the crazy cryptic clues refer to Dante's ""Inferno"", the first part of the epic poem ""The Divine Comedy"". Before we get to the meat of what Dante's ""Inferno"" has to do with a charismatic leader who has some pretty nutty ideas about how to improve humankind, women with big guns, well-dressed Africans, plague-inducing viruses, an underground ""protection service"" (we'll kill lots of people for you at reasonable rates kind of organization), and Harvard professor, Robert Langdon, let's explain Dante's ""Inferno"".""Inferno"" (""Hell"") is the first of three large sections or ""books"" of the most famous literary work of the Middle Ages, ""The Divine Comedy"" by Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). (""Comedy"" in this sense doesn't mean ""humorous"" but simply means it was written in a style accessible to the common man and has a positive ending, as opposed to ""high tragedy"" which was often in a more affluent style with a tragic ending.) Dante wakes up into a kind of ""dream"" in which he comes to the entrance of Hell. Dante, escorted by the ancient poet Virgil, goes on an horrific tour of Hell in which he witnesses the nine different rings or ""levels"" of Hell, and at each level, the sufferer-residents are being tormented in a way which is conducive to their sins when alive, such as carnal malefactors or those who had endless lust and are blown back and forth by an endless wind. Throughout the levels, Dante sees the sufferers and at each level the suffering becomes worse.Back to Langdon. We see a man offering a lecture to a mesmerized audience about over-population which will supposedly come to the Earth if something isn't done. The lecturer's solution: enact a drastic measure to wipe out half of the earth's human population. We then see visions of catastrophe where poor suffering souls similar to Dante's ""Inferno"" are dying or tormented in urban streets. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role of the two previous Langdon movies) wakes up in a hospital room in Florence, but he doesn't know why he's there. He was on a recording as saying ""I'm sorry"" when he staggered into hospital several hours earlier. He appears to be suffering from a gun-shot wound to the head and he can't remember the last 48 hours. An attractive young doctor, Sienna (Felicity Jones) attends to him who speaks with a British-English accent and also fluent Italian. Just as they're trying to figure out how he got there, shots ring out and some baddies are chasing after Langdon, particularly a woman in leather dressed as an Italian police officer.So begins ""Inferno"" in which secret clues and other cryptic messages have been hidden along a kind of artistic ""trail"" which should lead to the final answer. And guess what? They all relate to Dante! The clues begin at the Palazzo Vecchio and continue to the Duomo and then to other parts of Europe and even beyond. Similar to ""The Da Vinci Code"", Langdon's companion is a young women trying to help him get through everything. Sort of an Italian equivalent of Sophie. There are also flashbacks to someone who died at the beginning. Like the Da Vinci Code, there's an important artifact and even an unexpected twist.It's certainly entertaining but it's probably the weakest of the Langdon films. ""Angels and Demon"" uses much less of the Langdon formula but ""Inferno"" uses much more. Although the idea of the plague and Dante are loosely connected, I wanted to hear more about the connection between Dante and the plot. The great plague of the late Middle Ages circa 1350 is certainly one of the most catastrophic moments in European history, although Dante really wasn't quite writing about the plague per se. ""The Divine Comedy"" was completed about 30 years before the plague and was mostly intriguing because it became the model by which Hell was portrayed in Europe and later America thereafter. Although in this story, the plot line was desperately trying to fuse the two together."

" Missing the atmosphere.
",-0.296,0.9986,2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Henny's Movie Review: InfernoIn Three Words: Missing the atmosphere.10 years ago a movie named The Da Vinci Code was released in theaters telling a controversial story that reached the attention of the Catholic Church (yes it was the book that really caused the wrath of the church, but that's beside the point because this is about movies). The funny thing is at the same time another movie was released starring Nicolas Cage named National Treasure. Both a mystery movie, but one was a slow thriller and the other an action movie. So what does this have to do with Inferno? Well I'm intrigued in how movie franchises can evolve overtime, because this movie franchise, based on the books of Dan Brown, has completely changed from thriller to action and not in a good way.The following review will first start with a short rambling by an old cinephile about the Dan Brown movies, after that I'll discuss Inferno.I have always put the Dan Brown movies in a separate movie category than movies like National Treasure or even Indiana Jones. That is because these movies (Dan Brown) were different; they took their time to tell their story, with slow moments that visually helped us to solve the mystery together with the protagonist. And I LOVE these moments with great music by Hans Zimmer. That is why it is a shame that they have thrown all of this out and instead they have chosen for a quick mystery from point A to B. Yes, I know Angels and Demons wasn't a great movie either, but that movie still had its moments Inferno does not.Inferno Story and Character:Robert Langdon is back as the great professor of symbology, played by Tom Hanks, and this time he is in Italy. He wakes up in a hospital with amnesia and visions of horrible things. It is from that moment on that he needs to learn to understand these visions and why he is in Italy. This time he is supported by a doctor named Sienna Brooks (love that name), played by Felicity Jones.The story follows a similar setup as previous movies only with a much faster pace. During the movie I felt like I was running through the story. I won't discuss the story too much since I don't want to spoil it. What I will say is that the story was mediocre at best.Robert Langdon is always a great character and I would like to believe that Tom Hanks loves to play this character, but in this movie it felt like he was going through the motions. There were no moments for this character to truly shine. Sienna Brooks was an okay character, however I wish we could have had more character moments with her.Three Act Structure:Inferno has a good beginning showing much potential of what the movie could've been. - It has a mediocre middle, - And a mediocre ending.Music:As aforementioned I like the music by Hans Zimmer especially the OST for these movies. However, did Hans Zimmer even compose anything for this movie? Because there were too many silent moments that could have used some underscores and other moments that could have used some true iconic music themes to establish certain scenes. They were ALL missing. Such a shame.The reason why I started this review with a short comparison between Dan Brown movies and National Treasure is because I think it is funny how certain movies have evolved. I still remember when people called National Treasure a rip off of The Da Vinci Code and right now I would almost say that Inferno is ripping off National Treasure (based on pacing only :) ). It is a shame that things have turned out this way but the movie was still enjoyable enough for me to recommend it.I will give this movie a 6.5"
" The book is far better than the movie...
",0.4404,0.9372,2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"If you have read Dan Brown's book, this movie is not for you. The ending has been totally changed. Unlike the book, where there are many twists in the end, the movie prefers an ending that was more suitable for an action movie. Also, the essence of the book - the suspense and the mystery - was not there, as the movie was too fast paced. Sienna's brilliance that was portrayed on the book did not come out justifiably in the movie. Irrfan Khan was good in his role. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is getting too old in my opinion. However, if you can keep an open mind and watch this movie as a thriller, it is not that bad. Those who haven't read the book, or have forgotten the plot, would probably enjoy it. Overall, an average movie, the book is far more fascinating."

I wouldn't know and I don't care.This movie sucks regardless of its other merits because a) the direction is somewhere between awful and mediocre. b) the camera work and cinematography is simply said a mess. and c) the editing of this work is nauseous. The editing is so bad it is like a roller coaster ride during which you lose consciousness and see flashbacks of random events while your point of view keeps teleporting to different angles and locations. I have seen better edited Call of Duty meme montage videos on youtube. The flow of this movie makes no sense. Event one, event two, a trip, solve a puzzle. It's like a constantly firing machine gun which misses every shot. I recommend watching this movie solely for the comedic value of the scene where Tom Hank points a visual representation of Dante's Hell and says something like ""here"". Reminded me of those 'yeah it is funny' videos of Gordon Ramsey talking while some other guy edited himself making the actions which Ramsey speaks of."
" Rent, don't purchase Ron Howard's Inferno

Director Howard has succumbed to the clich√© camera-work fashions of this century, which dictate that any thriller must be contorted into another Jason Bourne clone. Not only is its egregiously off-putting ""steady-cam"" overindulged, but when Howard gifts the viewer a minute or two of visuals actually shot from a tripod or dolly (usually an intimate scene between Hanks and a female), then the scene is set out in a public area with extras incessantly walking across in front of the camera. Although not as intriguing as other Dan Brown plots, ""Inferno"" is mildly suspenseful and extremely well acted. What a pity, then, that Ron Howard has thrown in the towel to copycat those cinematography techniques that work okay for the Bourne series, but have ruined dozens of otherwise enjoyable films by making it impossible to become immersed in a story and to care what happens to main characters."

Regardless of this being the weakest of the series, it is still a wonderful film and you can literally see the money on the screen. Tom Hanks is great as usually.

And to prevent the reaction of those who have read the book, I'll tell you that I also have read the 'Da Vinvi Code' and the 'Illuminati', and even if I think that 'Illuminati' was a better book than DVC, I regard the latter one to be brought way better on screen.So I'm quite certain that you can make a good movie on a 'not so good' book or even on a ' a priori' complex book story.I won't lie.At the beginning of the film, I saw potential.It was the flow and the extreme peculiarity of the events that in the end left me with a bitter taste that covered the undoubtedly 'artistic' aura and the - always fascinating - Dante references and backstory.5/10 and I know it will sound 'cliche', but I regard the first movie as the best out of this trilogy."
" Infernal
",0.0,-0.9326,2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"Angels and Demons came out in 2009 so Inferno is a belated and cheap looking sequel, just check out some horribly bad green screen work.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) wakes up confused in an Italian hospital with Dr Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) telling him he is suffering from amnesia when a bullet grazed his head and a hit-woman soon comes for him.Langdon has some fuzzy flashbacks and visions relating to Dante's Inferno, this is part of a trail left by billionaire scientist Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) who believed the earth was overpopulated and drastic controls needed to be taken and he was silenced by government agents.There is just something off about this film and I think it was due to the budgetary constraints and also this time Langdon was not on a search but being chased. If you have seen the previous Dan Brown adaptations then it will not take long to realise that someone close to Langdon will betray him.We have the usual globe trotting from Italy to Istanbul but this is how predictable the film is. The moment the action moved to Turkey, I knew we will see a shot of the Blue Mosque, scenes in the Hagia Sophia and then wind end up in the Basilica Cistern for the climax.There is very little that was surprising in this film and I felt uneasy about the overpopulation mantra in this movie. One think that Zobrist did not seemed to have considered in his plan. If you half the population of the planet, how long would it be before it doubles again? What you going to carry out another mass slaughter in the future?"
" No thought put into the authors story and a total feeling of ""cannot be bothered"" by cast and crew through the entire film(s)
",0.0675,0.1782,2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"I honestly believe the books are just not converting to the big screen for the simple reason the books have to much info for the silver screen to digest in 2hours, so it is condensed, to the point where its either to obvious to predict or just leaves out chunks of information, thus the editing leaves a lot on the cutting room floor.I would honestly prefer either 2 films of the same book (i.e. part 1 &2) or a 3-4 hr movie that can transfer the the credentials of the authors writing rather than a rushed hacked job. Unfortunately for this franchise at least, the studio take away the elements of the books that make them best sellers and try to turn them into the usual Hollywood blockbuster drivel. To us mere mortals that would seem an incredibly stupid thing to do, especially as its the authors' credit that the books engross you by, indeed the storytelling, so why after failure No1 in the Da Vinci Code, do they make 2 + 3 in the exact same fashion.such potential, as a series could of been one of the greats instead we have a cash hungry formula which so often fails to deliver, yet is so often replicated. wasted opportunity.Maybe, we could get a re-boot in a few years that do the books justice."
" Floundering Franchise Without an Identity
",0.0,0.6461,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Robert Langdon returns to save the world from a sinister airborne pathogen in this continuation of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code franchise. Oddly, despite three jumbo-sized films and a whole mess of fluffy promotion, the series has yet to settle on a definitive identity for itself. Where I felt there was a whiff of something worth pursuing in the first film - a middle-aged professor, cracking dusty cryptographs against the backdrop of ancient history - subsequent films have steadily minimized that in favor of beefier, more generic reaches. In Inferno's case, Langdon has been plopped into the aftermath of a personality cult and blessed with a case of amnesia. It feels like a mismatch from the start, like Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock taking the spotlight in the latest Bourne adventure, and never settles into much of a rhythm. The constant wheel-jerks and ""shock and awe"" plot twists of the earlier chapters haven't gone anywhere, of course, and they're still far too numerous for their own good. Such drastic shifts lose all meaning if they occur at five-minute intervals. Costars Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones have a certain entrancing dynamic, a central relationship which is robbed of its defining moment by the abundance of such plot acrobatics. The shame of it is, Inferno actually has a few clever ideas. Tragically, they're almost completely washed away by hopeless over-complication and desperate mood swings."
" quiet simply infernal!
",0.0,-0.6262,2017-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Another disappointing ""dan brown"" movie from Ron Howard. honestly it's like he read the book, put it away, and then thought to him self ""hhmm... how can i ruin this completely?!"". he's changed the story so much, that watching the movie is an utterly new experience to people who have read the book before, and certainly not a good one! it's like he's deliberately tried to escape every part of the story which could've given the audience some artistic or historical views of the matter, and instead he's chosen to give the viewers a taste of what would a ""Bourne"" movie feel like if they were to cast ""Tom Hanks"" as ""Jason Bourne"" , and the movie were to take part in Italy instead of U.S.A! in conclusion; if you haven't read the book, watching the movie wont bother you at least, it would be like watching a mediocre Sunday movie. but if you've already read the book, and worst, if you like the book, you'd be feeling suicidal after watching the movie. thank you Mr.Howard... for nothing."
" Too Long Between Films
",0.0,-0.5828,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Honestly--it took Dan Brown less time to write the book than it did to bring it to film and what happened in the meantime is that everyone forgot the last two films. I've read all three books and even I didn't remember the events leading up to this film. You can't really do a trilogy that depends heavily on the first two books and then wait 7 years to get it out. Here's Dan Brown's timeline: Angels & Demons (2000) The Da Vinci Code (2003) The Lost Symbol (2009) Inferno (2013) And here's Ron Howard's: Angels & Demons (2006) The Da Vinci Code (2009) Inferno (2016) Books are forgiving--you can pick one up and read the last chapter and you're right there. Films are not forgiving. This film should have been done in two parts; one released immediately after the other. Maybe it's just me; maybe I have a short memory. But this is the impression I got watching it. It wasn't bad. If I had 6 hours to kill, I'd watch them back-to-back. But I don't and I won't."
" Worst Movie Ever
",-0.6249,-0.7425,2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"I created an account just so I could make this review. You will witness bad acting, bad word pronunciation in foreign language (Italian) and bad accent (Parts where Siena should speak fluent Italian).Just finished reading the book and I can tell you that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I have seen some). If they change half of the book characters, add a few more, cut off the rest and ENTIRELY change the plot, they would better also change the title. If you have read the book, please do not watch this movie. I repeat: DO NOT. WATCH. THE MOVIE. Save yourself two hours of your life. Better go play tetris, or take a nap. It is outrageous."
" Ending was horrible.
",-0.5423,-0.9875,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"There was no need to change the ending. The book was so good because of the ending and discussion regarding over population which is a very serious matter but I don't know how the movie missed that plot. Very very disappointed. The main audience for this movie will be the book readers and it disappoints them. Adding a love plot with WHO director is also another waste of time.The book has so much history about Florence and Dante and discusses the menace of over population and also a good(if not wonderful) solution for this. Seriously, something has to be done to fight this over population. Instead of mass killing, the idea of making 33% of people infertile(that too completely random), sounds a very good solution to me but the movie missing that plot made me disappointed and gave bad rating. If not for that, movie was okay."
" Boring, boring, extremely boring
",-0.7096,-0.9318,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"The other films were at least rather entertaining. ""Inferno"" is just a mixture of flamboyant interpretations of different works of art. The film hasn't any action scene worth to see, the persecution scenes are lame. The director work is abysmal, the pace of the whole movie is absolutely slow and the ending is utterly disappointing. Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones deliver the worst roles of their careers. Their performances were bland and dull, and this may be the consequence of the horrendous direction. Many people said that the book was great, unfortunately the film is NOT. Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time watching this terrible production."
" Well.. the name is the same
",0.0,0.8227,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"If you have read the books and enjoyed them you will be happy to know that at least the name is the same.They have COMPLETELY changed the entire movie into something totally unrecognizable, this is complete trash and while I did not expect anything good from it, it STILL disappointed me.The books are good and the best one of them is Inferno and that is because of the absolutely GREAT ending, this movie sh*ts on that and does it's own ending and changes everything for the worse, turning it into this steaming pile of dung that you have before you.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
