" Awfully filthy
",0.0,-0.5719,2017-10-05 00:00:00,1,I was in the mood to watch filth and hence i wasted two hours of my precious life. This movie makes you puke umpteen number of times. Hence if you have constipation you should definitely watch this movie. It will give you loose motions and you will keep puking limitless. The Man who made these movies lives in his head and he is self proclaimed superstar. I wish I was allowed to slap him on his face for making this crap
" Outrageous up-voting
",-0.4588,-0.7,2017-08-30 00:00:00,1,"It is 2017 and I decided to write in view of the recent verdict of rape charges against the main protagonist of the movie. The movie is once more a pure publicity stunt and hyped in IMDb by people who either doesn't have any sense of judgment or are wholly unscrupulous. As I decided not to write a detailed spoiler which I believe I cannot do in all my academic sanity (back 2015 I couldn't carry on watching the movie after the first hour), I shall take the opportunity to criticize IMDb scrutiny system. An IMDb rating of 7 out of 10 would likely put this complete nonsense on the same footing as Robert Langdon series or Wes Anderson movies. Though the later cannot be recommended on their intellectual aspects but the subtlety of speed and detail is way sane than MSG messenger series. I strongly ask the IMDb pole to have a benchmark threshold for commendable reviews as exists for example for Allocin√© or Rotten Tomato."
" bad actor - big rapist
",-0.8555,-0.9823,2017-08-26 00:00:00,1,now i know why the movie was a big flop. obviously no one liked his acting thats why he has been caught by raping girls. shame on rapist baba and his followers. i would suggest everyone not watch this movie except they want to waste their time on this rapist. shame on haryana the people who still support him. rapist ram rahim.
" Worst movie till date in the whole of Indian cinema
",-0.6249,-0.1037,2017-08-25 00:00:00,1,"I read few reviews before providing mine and was surprised that there are so many people who have given it 10 out of 10 and most of those have insan in their user id, not hard to guess who has been bumping the ratings to astronomical heights for this movie, guys a little more effort and this can be at 1st place. The only thing that comes to the mind after seeing those reviews, either those reviewers were on high or have never seen any other movie. This is the worst movie i have seen, its possible there might be someone in the future generations that may come up with a worse film. For the time being this movie is safe of losing its position at the lowest level. To be honest the hero and everything of the movie is down to earth, with all the capabilities he has he is so humble to call himself messenger not the master himself."
" Biggest mistake of my life
",-0.34,-0.9513,2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"I actually watched this movie out of curiosity because i was aware of the ""blockbuster"" releases of Dr. MSG and just wanted to experience one myself(my bad). The movies at the core has a good message,agreed. But the execution is pathetic. 20 minutes into the movie and you will regret your decision. Unfortunately this fest drags on for more then 3 hours. In the end i would say that 15 minutes documentary would have been sufficient and prevented the suffering"
