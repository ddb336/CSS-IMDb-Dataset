" Another fun Burton film!
",0.5562,-0.3261,2021-04-08 00:00:00,7,"Home for Peculiar Children isn't an amazing movie, but it has plenty of cool characters and visuals. It's entertaining as hell."
" Don't listen to the bad critics!!
",-0.7418,0.9677,2021-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Great movie!! Super inspirational, mysterious, funny, heartfelt, scary, moving. I love this movie! It's a repeat watch multiple times!!"
" could have been much much better !
",0.4926,-0.4215,2021-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Despite appealing visuals, there still seem to be banality of repetition....and sadly the dialogues were not inspiring..."
" Haven't read the book...yet...but enjoyed the watch a lot
",0.5106,0.9963,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"I came into this movie only after watching the trailer, didn't even know there was a book series. I generally like Tim Burton's movies and expect his...peculiar aesthetics in them all. About halfway in I saw that this was based on a book and I immediately purchased the trilogy on Amazon. I'm looking forward to the read, especially after reading other reviews saying that the book is different. Either in the ending or characters. I'm actually looking forward to reading the books a lot after finishing the movie because I want to learn more about this world! It definitely sucked me in and I thought overall it was really good - effects, score, acting (kids can be hit or miss but so we're the Harry Potter kids, the first few movies are pretty tough at some points) but I enjoyed Sam L Jackson's character in this. Others have said his character is scarier in the books, well that he's a combination of villains specifically, but I thought he did a great job for someone not familiar with the books.My only critique is that it is, or at least my wife and I interpreted it as, a children's film but there were definitely some scary imagery in it. We watched it with our kids (10 & 8) and they were definitely creeped out so if you plan on watching this with your kids, maybe watch it first and decide if your kids can handle it. I thought it was really cool and captivating throughout.As for book to movie adaptations, it's OBVIOUS that books give so much more detail and insights into the characters than a movie can hope to give without being 3+ hours. I do my best to separate the experiences and accept them for the medium they are in. For instance, Stephen Kings The Shining had some MAJOR differences between the book and movie. But when you can separate them as their own works they are both great for different reasons. You do get rare movie adaptations that are exactly what you would want (The Green Mile, which is about 85% word for word and scene for scene of the source material) and then others that just take the source material as inspiration for the director to make their own story with some same or similar plot points and characters.Overall, great film. It was good enough for me to buy the books halfway through and I'm looking forward to getting more details and seeing the original material and what it has in store."
" Lesser Burton film
",0.0,0.8786,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Starts off slow but eventually hooks the viewer with its fantastical setting. Not a bad film and worth watching, but it feels a bit lackluster."
" Great potential, bad result
",0.1531,-0.9011,2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"I was hyped by this movie or looked that it has great potential, but the problem is that they did it wrong, the visual effects are great also the special ones, the story is also great(the one of the book) but something make them fail, and it was the way they change the book to the big screen, they change some important elements of the book and change them to the movie but the problem is that it fails and the result was disappointing."
" Cute...
",0.0,0.8941,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I love dark teen films, and the peculiar, bizarre and passionate children, captivating us ... But I must admit that their peculiarities caused me a certain anguish, the bees on the face, teeth on the back of the neck, urgh ... The story is passionate, and the adorably horrible little monsters won me over... Cute..."
" What a disappointment
",-0.5106,0.6395,2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,"The movie barely stayed true to the book and, when it did, major points (character details, plot, etc.) were changed. If you liked the book, save yourself the inevitable disappointment and don't see the movie."
" Disappointed :(
",-0.7184,0.3157,2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoyed the novel so I was excited to watch the film to see how they adapted it, but to my great disappointment so many things were changed. They completely got rid of Ricky and replaced him with Shelly. There was no old man watering his lawn, just an old man standing in the middle of the road. They changed so much and I can't say I didn't anticipate it but I didn't expect so many changes. Plus Dr. Nolan being a woman in the movie completely ruins the backstory of Golan in the book(SPOILER: Golan was also Jake's bus driver and the man who took care of their lawn and pool in the novel.)
I still don't understand why they switched around Emma and Olive's peculiarities, and why they made Olive a teenager when she's actually one of the younger children in the books.
The film made so many changes it made it quite difficult to watch.TL;DR If you've read the novel(or the whole series) don't watch the movie, you'll be immensely disappointed. Asa Butterfield was great as always though."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.5244,2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,I can't understand people complaining about how this or that was wrong into this magical Burtonesque adventure. I really enjoyed every second of it.
" Do you want to know what killed me?
",-0.6369,0.9654,2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those ""mid Tim Burton"" movies, not up there with Ed Wood, Batman Returns or Big Fish but not down the well with Alice in Wonderland or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory either.Burton seemed like the perfect choice to deal with the material (adapted from the first book of a young adult fantasy series), as the director has always been enamored with bittersweet stories of creepy/poetic outcasts. The result is watchable but beyond its full potential.Young Jake (Asa Butterfield) loses his beloved grampa (the great Terence Stamp), who used to tell him incredible tales from his youth before being mysteriously killed. Jake visits an island in Wales to find out his grampa's stories were true: he finds a school with a group of superpowered children and teens, tutored by Miss Peregrine (Eva Green, always interesting).The headmistress and her pupils are stuck in a time loop in an ever-repeating day of 1943 - which Miss Peregrine resets every evening before a Nazi bombardment destroys their mansion - hiding from a group of sinister creatures hunting them.The first act is a little slow but the second gets genuinely compelling - I was on board with the movie at that point. There are some neat ideas: the ""peculiar children"" of unusual skills enjoying a sheltered, unending youth but unable to grow up and lead an actual life; Miss Peregrine Groundhog-Daying her routine, from answering the same phone call again and again to slaying a monster always attacking at the same hour. There were enough ideas for a whole mini-series in this section of the film.Sadly, the last act peters out into something conventional and nowhere as intriguing, the typical showdown with the Bad Guys™ - including a ghoulish Samuel L. Jackson, a usually fantastic actor who here hams it up like (appropriately) there is no tomorrow. The rules of time travel established earlier get sloppy and confusing; the themes of choice and loss get a very hasty ""love trumps all"" resolution. Pity, there was a great concept back in that second act. It's also weird how the script desperately hastens to tie up all loose ends, whereas the source material ended with an effective cliffhanger (and the book series is still going on - five novels and counting). I appreciate giving some closure in case you don't get to make a sequel, but this felt like deliberately torpedoing any chance of a second movie.Parental advice, this isn't for smaller children (younger than 10). The tone is mostly lighthearted but, in typical Burton fashion, there are creepy creatures (which look like they swam all the way from Silent Hill) and grotesque moments, including monsters gorging on their victims' eyeballs... yeah.6,5/10"
" It's not the worst thing but...
",0.5096,-0.8409,2020-11-13 00:00:00,2,"I won't lie, it's not great. It's the kind of movie that should've either stayed a book, be 3 movies long, or pull a ""A Series of Unfortunate Events: A Netflix Original"" and gotten a series. I mean come on, the plot is 3 stories long, and that's just THIS part of the story, in total there's 6 books plus extra stuff.I read the books first, and yes read the books, they're awesome, top notch, everything I want in a book. This movie, however, as someone who read the books, is rushed, a tad annoying, and THEYVE CHANGED PEOPLE AROUND!Olive is supposed to be a little girl, who is lighter than air. Emma is supposed to be fire gal or whatever. Bronwyn is supposed to be the same age as Emma and Jacob, NOT JAKE BTW HIS NAME IS JACOB. Fiona is supposed to be a messy haired mute, and has a smootchy smootchy thing going with Horace(or Hugh I honestly can't remember). And, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Miss Peregrine a tad extra ""peculiar"" than in the books? I feel like she's unnecessarily odd.Now I may have been able to look past all these character changes, had the plot been spot on. However it was not. This film, on multiple occasions, felt like it required me to have read the books to fill in the gaps. This point of no return in the movie comes at like the very end of the movie? It doesn't set enough time aside to deal with anything in regards to, for example, the villains motives, or develop the villains in such a way, whereas I somewhat sympathize with them, to a point of understanding their point of view, but disapprove of their way of getting their desired results.All in all, it's not very good, read the books yall, they're awesome. This movie kinda gives me a Percy Jackson/Eragon fail, that I just kinda can't look past..."
" Peculiar children
",0.1531,0.6249,2020-11-08 00:00:00,6,This definitely was a adaptation from the book that Tim burton would do.With creepy imagery and monsters and powers/abilities the villain or children have.Go see the movie it was creepy fun to watch and the third act was interesting.
" Nice visual effects but plot not so good.
",-0.4841,0.1284,2020-11-05 00:00:00,4,The plot is not so strong to capture the mind and the heart of the audience. I felt like I gained nothing emotionally. I think every film should be able to leave a mark in the mind and heart of its audience in order to be called worth-watching.
" The First Thirty Minutes were Great!
",0.6588,0.1615,2020-11-03 00:00:00,4,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the latest young adult adaptation which is directed by Tim Burton and stars Asa Butterfield, Eva Green and Samuel L. Jackson. This film is about a boy named Jacob, who stumbles across a mystery that makes him travel through time to discover Miss Peregrine's home, which is housed to children that have special abilities. Now I'll be honest, I really wasn't looking too forward to this film, Tim Burton's last couple live action films haven't been very good and overall I haven't been a fan of the recent trend of young adult novel adaptations as a lot of those movies just feel cheap and rushed. However I really dug this film, at least for the first hour. The movie opens and it has a really slick editing style, with striking shots that gave me such an indie horror movie vibe, that I got the impression that I may be in for something special, but that mood fades once the protagonist arrives in Wales to discover Miss Peregrine. I'm not saying the movie got horrible after that but it was just a tonal shift from something that I was seriously digging. The rest of the movie focuses on Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children, and for the first 40 minutes it is quite interesting getting the introduction to all the characters and seeing their abilities are pretty cool. Unlike most young adult adaptations, Burton was able to create a movie that felt like it stuck to its dark material and didn't shy away from being scary, which is something I cant say for most movies from this genre. I'm not sure how much of the source material Burton stuck to but he brought forth his own weirdness to it that didn't feel like over-the-top Burton-ness. Though there are some things that due deserve praise in this film, it sadly has a lot of things weighing it down including a very weak and lifeless performance by Asa Butterfield who is normally very good in the roles he's played. However here, I don't know if he was directed to speak all his lines as if he doesn't care but he does. Also the last half of the film takes a turn for the worst by having a really stupid, over-exaggerated climax with skeletons straight out of Army of Darkness, luckily though Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding and really elevates the finally act. My only other real problem with the film is it doesn't explain itself thoroughly, and left me questioning the logic of some things brought up throughout. So this isn't a perfect movie but it's fun for what it's worth, and I'm sure many kids will get a kick out of the film, I just wish it would have maintained that tone at the beginning throughout. Overall I do recommend this film as it is better than most young adult adaptations, and I would like to see a sequel to this film only if it doesn't get as stupid as that third act did, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children gets a 4/10."
" loved the movie
",0.5994,0.9537,2020-11-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm more of a comedy/drama/action type movie person so when I decided to go to a movie today, and found out my theater only had one 3D movie showing and it was this one, I watched the trailer and I thought.. ""ah, it's OK"" .. I like 3D movies, so that's what I wanted to go see, the movie itself wasn't exactly my main priority, although I thought I could like it anyway even if it wasn't what I normally would see. Anyway, I get to the movie and it starts out, and right off the bat I'm hooked. I mean, what was going on with this character? Then it got going, we learned some background information.. as it progresses it just keeps the viewer interested. It has been a long time since I went to a movie and not once looked at my watch. When it ended, I didn't want it to end! I hope they do a sequel! Go see it, get into a different world, it's awesome!"
" typical Burton nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.5106,2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,"Overblown, overbearing and ugly. Full of precocious children as usual"
" Nice production values, but I'm not a teenage girl
",0.4118,0.7964,2020-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Sorry to stray into stereotyping, but I can't see who this was aimed at other than the aforementioned demographic. I'd happily have watched this - even several times - with my daughter, during her teenage years. But any other time? - if I must.
It is little more than a hotch-potch of other stories, knitted together by a nice idea of a time loop (viz X-Men, Groundhog Day, Time Bandits).
Oh, and some nice acting, let down by shockingly forced accents across the board, especially Asa."
" It could've been so good...
",0.0,0.374,2020-08-19 00:00:00,5,"But at the end I had like so much questions, and also a lot of scenes where my mind blocked because there were quite a few irregularities, which is sad for a movie that seemed so good in the trailer."
" Not like the book but still great and enjoyable
",0.8734,0.9376,2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,I love the book and even though they changed a lot in this movie the changes weren't so bad and I ended up really enjoying and liking the movie
" A good Friday watch!
",0.4926,0.1833,2020-06-25 00:00:00,9,"They have a very promising plot despite infusing too many familiar themes which are already found in other stories, films and series. Or maybe these other works of art were inspired by the book, it's really hard to tell at this point.Peculiar children hiding from people for safety because their gifts make them dangerous (very 'X-Men'), protagonist relating more to his humanity side thinking he doesn't possess powers but he actually does (so 'Sky High'), time-loops that reset the last 24 hours of a specific date (uhm, hello May 10, 1994 prison world of The Vampire Diaries!), a tired love story and many more.I haven't read the books so I can't relate to readers complaining about the changes they made to the film. As a viewer however, I could say that Tim Burton's touch is impossible not to be felt in every scene. At least, there's something to hold on to if you enjoyed his other works.The film is an almost-there attempt to be something special in a sea full of similar genres. It builds the hype but it falls flat up to the very end. The acting is not outstanding except for Miss Peregrine herself.Should you watch it after you read the book? Of course you should.Should you watch it on the big screen as a stand-alone film? If you have other choices, I say you go with them."
" So amazing a fantasy with a heart touching story of love
",0.8516,0.9435,2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,"I am in amazed watching the story of love. No it is not a boring fantasy. It is an amazing story of love. I promise, you will be too if you but know what love is."
" Only watch this if you don't plan on reading the book!
",0.0,0.8828,2020-05-17 00:00:00,2,"I went into this excited to see a great book-turned-movie. This was not that. Obviously movies adapted from books are never exactly the same, we all know that, but after the first 45 minutes, the movie went from an adaptation to a totally different movie. I'm not sure why the writer and director didn't just write their own movie instead of naming it after the book. It's completely different by the end and fans of the book will be highly disappointed. If you love the book I do not recommend watching this movie. If you do not plan on ever reading the book then you might enjoy this movie. It is probably something I would have enjoyed had I not read the book already."
" Something went really wrong here
",-0.5256,-0.9641,2020-05-04 00:00:00,5,"I hope to read some day in an unofficial behind the scenes story WHAT THE HELL happened to this movie in the second half, that was just plain ridiculous and stupid.
Also there's no, no, no reason at all why they needed to change the female lead. Was it so bad that she was powerful and dangerous? Oh, in fact, that was an important part of the character?The only thing I could think of is that somewhere during the making of the movie the director got really annoyed by someone and wanted to make sure the franchise can never be put on screen again?"
" Protect your eyes!!! Lol

I'm just going by how the movie was.I'd give it a 7.5 if that were an option.Great cast! Some well known faces in this one (although several have a short amount of screen time).If you like good movies,, you'll like this,,,
so go watch it!"
" Good movie with a tone problem.
",0.0516,0.5611,2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Interesting and mysterious story, terrifying monsters, but the movie's climactic fight with the evil monsters was cheapened with ""home alone"" esque action. It was rather bizzare to see child-murdering, eyeball eating abominations assaulted with snowballs thrown by children, and hit on the head by a carusel, the movie went from truly creepy to Tom and Jerry. It was a compelling story, cute and funny and truly mysterious and creepy, but oddly unsuitable for children while also being rather immature for adults. I guess it's not so bad for a movie to not take itself too seriously."
" Why didn't those twins act more helpful since the beginning of the movie ?

Why wait all the way till nearly the end of the movie for them to actually do something useful.Also for some peculiar kids, most of their powers are meh"
" Even Eva can't save this one
",-0.3875,0.9959,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this film, almost convinced myself I would like it actually. Based upon a marvelous book by Ransom Riggs, directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and starring the enchanting Eva Green (Casino Royale), Judi Dench (Best Exotic Marigold Hotel), Rupert Everett (Prince Charming in Shrek) and the always amazing Terence Stamp (far too many classics to mention) this looked liked a sure-fire banker in every possible way. Only I didn't and it wasn't. It was entertaining enough for sure, but just somehow managed to miss every mark it was probably aiming for.Dubbed as Tim Burton's X-Men, a film he self classified as a anti-superhero film there were unfortunately just too many convoluted things happening, plot holes, inconsistencies and changes from the book, which is what actually made it worth turning into a film in the first place. Now I do appreciate that a books audience is not necessarily a films audience. The two mediums are different and generally have different demographics they aim for (that's not to say one cannot enjoy both though). Those are just some of the issues at hand here in what could have been a magical and mystical film that captivated you.I suppose the first issue here must be the script. Kingsman the Secret Service was not too bad as a screenplay but X-Men: First Class and Future Past were not the best. Here she made far too many changes for it to work effectively. Perhaps an occasion where the writer of the novel should have had more say (that does not always work though). The second issue here to my mind is Tim Burton, and it saddens me to say that. Whatever happened to him in 2005? Sure he had the odd wobble here and there but generally the guy was a banker from Beetlejuice to Corpse Bride with a couple of forgettable and forgivable films in-between.But something happened after then. Willy Wonka, Sweeny Todd, Dark Shadows, Alice and the list goes on. While still visually interesting and his style, the films themselves just fell flat from what was his trademark unique traits. Unfortunately, this film also shows that the master of the gothic and weird has not regained his magical touch yet. Visually the film is fantastic with some excellent set design even if the film generally is a little washed out and pale.If you have read the excellent book you already know the basics of the story line here. Jake (Butterfield) learns of an accident that befalls his grandfather (Stamp) and eventually ends up traveling to Wales with his father. While there he discovers a magical portal back to 1943 and the orphanage his grandfather had told him so much about in stories, despite Jake's father's protestations. Here he meets the peculiar children that his grandfather spoke about so fondly, including Emma (an impressive Purnell). He also meets Miss Peregrine (an excellent Green) who runs the house and looks after the children in a kind of Gothic Scary Poppins way. Perfectly cast.Jake soon learns about the problem they have and the time loop keeping them where they are. He also eventually learns about the evil creatures that are after them and their leader Barron (A hammed up Jackson). Acting generally is average, though Jackson is personally annoying. He seems to be unable to turn down any script that happens to pass his house, never mind any that are actually sent to him. The rest of the cast are passable and do just about enough. Unfortunately the likes of Green, Dench and Stamp are not actually in the film enough to keep your interest, especially in the latter half and mostly their abilities are largely wasted.The script gets very messy towards the end of the film and it really does feel like they tried to cram far too much in without having the time. Another major scripting issue is with the very tame (and lame perhaps) romance between Jake and Ella. There was no chemistry there and I was left wondering why she would be interested in him at all. It just didn't work in 'this' film. Ultimately, some bad casting choices (Butterfield) and a rather dull script lead to a rather overall dull film. There was no sense of awe or mystical excitement that the book created. Burton must surely take some of the blame for this, despite an average script he obviously seemed happy with.It is unfortunate that the novel was written when it was. Had it been written when Burton was at the height of his magic and Eva Green was the experienced sultry actress she is now then I'm sure this would have been a truly stunning and magical experience. As it stands, it is another miss from Burton and another wasted literary to celluloid conversion. Eva Green is awesome for her actual short screen time and the other actors are not really around enough to impose themselves. Visually impressive at times and a treat for the eyes with a reasonably enchanting score, this one ultimately fails to deliver its hype.
The Sage's Rating: 5/10"
" Surprisingly creepy and fantastical adaptation!
",0.6696,-0.7223,2020-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Based on the book series by Ransom Riggs, Jake (Asa Butterfield) is a troubled young man who is fascinated by a story his grandfather told him when he was a boy. After his grandfathers untimely death, he is obsessed with finding out the reality behind this story and goes to a scarcely populated town in Wales where the orphanage in the story is said to be. The main highlights of the film are when it gets really dark and takes a sinister turn; for example, Enoch (Finlay MacMillan) likes to taunt Jake upon their meeting and this brings a couple of intense scenes with Enoch bringing dead material back to life by shoving a heart into their chests. The villainous antagonists are also ridiculously spooky; Slenderman-esque creatures that crave children's eyeballs to feast on in order to morph into humans.... it's as creepy and darkly comic as that sounds! Really top end 12a certificate stuff and that's when Burton gets to work his magic and project beautifully grotesque imagery on screen. There are incredible moments here overshadowed by the confused narrative but it's worth a watch for all Burton fans"
" Not for kids!
",0.0,0.4404,2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"It's ok for Teens and up I suppose. Stuff of nightmares, with blood, death, gore. Was an interesting story. Unique. Good little movie."
" Good fantasy film but macabre in parts
",0.2382,0.6392,2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I missed this on the big screen and watched it on DVD --no doubt a less satisfying experience for a movie goer. The first time i saw it i ignored much of the middle part of the movie as i found it boring. It was the second time around that i enjoyed the film as i paid attention especially to the action scenes with the kids fighting the eye eating monsters.
The acting was good enough. Eva Green is marvelous and has real screen presence but the young man that grabbed my attention is Fin MacMillan who plays Enoch. He has the brooding intensity of a young Oliver Reed or Alan Bates and has in my opinion a great future ahead of him.
Now i am an oldie and have not read the book on which this movie is based so had no preconceived notions about the story line and therefore have no complaint about any liberties taken in the film that so upset many of those who have read the book. I agree with another reviewer here that scenes showing eye balls being extracted and eaten for purposes of transmogrification is defintely not suitable for younger children."
" Tim Burton's X-Men
",0.0,0.9954,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"If you like Harry Potter and/or X-Men, you will love this as well, because it's a combination of the two. Tim Burton was the perfect choice to direct this movie, because the creepy tone and style match the book perfectly. Some elements of the plot don't make very much sense, but that's ok, because despite it being somewhat convoluted at times, it's still very enjoyable. The only people in the cast that I think could have done better are Asa Butterfield and Samuel L. Jackson. I liked Asa Butterfield in ""Ender's Game,"" but here, he delivers almost every line in a flat and wooden way. He couldn't sound more uninterested if he tried. (If he was even trying at all, that is.) As for Samuel L. Jackson, his role is a little too over the top. I like when actors have fun, but they can overact, and Jackson's performance in this movie is an example of that. I enjoyed the story, and especially the cinematography. Every shot is so perfectly, that it's hard not to get immerresed in this movie's world. I know that's an odd thing to praise, but it's just so well done. The plot twists are unexpected and well concealed, and overall, this movie was just fantastic.
Grade: A- 9/10. 4/5 stars"
" Very bad acting on the part of Butterfield and Purnell
",-0.5849,0.9557,2020-03-27 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed the movie as it held my interest and was visually appealing. The peculiar children were quite charming and Eva Green was beautiful and excellent in her role. I was however completely put off by how bad the acting of the two main actors apart from Eva was. Butterfield was completely expressionless and wooden and Purnell just isn't a very good actress. Apart from these two everyone else put in a great performance.
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.7845,2020-03-21 00:00:00,6,I was mostly bored during the movie and the pacing was terrible. It started off promising and then immediately took a turn for the worst. The characters were flat and the plot made no sense. It also felt way too long and I kept wishing it would end.

The imagination of the movie is fabulous. The time loop is very creative. Peculiars' time loops are everywhere. It can be in the desert or even in the toilet. Only peculiars are able to get in. In the time loop, time stays at the same day. Everything in that day happens over and over again except the peculiars, but the peculiars are accustomed to it. I think it is interesting to stay in a time loop because something nice can happen time after time. But after ages I might get bored.
The characters are pretty cool. Like the girl Emma, she is lighter than air. Miss Peregrine gave her a pair of heavy metal shoes to keep her from flying up. Emma uses this power to breathe in the sea. She can also help others breathe in the sea. I like her power because I want to take a look at the bottom of the sea without a stubborn oxygen bottle. I also want to fly into the sky freely.
The special effects are terrific too. For example, the large boat on the wide sea, Miss Peregrine turning into a bird, the monsters, and characters' skills, etc. The whole color of the movie is kind of dark, just like it was covered with dust. Some parts of movie are horrific, such as people without eyeballs, monster eating eyeballs and toys with true hearts. When I was watching the beginning of the movie, I was scared. I even didn't want to continue. But after I watched it all, I enjoyed in this movie. But still, I don't think this movie is for milquetoasts.
I gave 8.5 stars. You can watch it if you plan to have an exciting movie and you are over 10 years old. It is a fantastic movie! I hope you watch it. You'll probably like it!

" Enjoyable, but could be better
",0.7003,0.9509,2020-03-02 00:00:00,7,"After reading the book and also all the 1 star reviews on IMDb, I, honestly, quite liked the film. Not perfect but still well produced and with amazing visual effects. The most un-Tim Burton film (I mean it in a good way) Tim has made, taking a break from Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter or even Alan Rickman. All I'm saying is that it's a GOOD film, but nothing more. This is a short review but it says it all. I recommend to be over 10 to watch this cause it gave me the chills and should be classified as horror."

But,oh,boy what a disappointment!
Movie doesn't follow the book at all.
What happend with Emma and Olivia?
My favorite book of all time ended like this.
So sad !:("

" Don't compare it to the book !!!!
",0.0,0.9516,2019-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I find it so annoying when reviewers compare films to the books that they are based on.
The book is always better for so many reasons.
A couple of reviewers have complained that the film doesn't tell the full back stories of the characters. What do you expect !!! if they did that it would end up being a four hour film.
Myself, I never read the books, I just wait for the movie.
Rant over, now the film.
I found it to be a good family film (Mabey not for the younger kids) with plenty of thrills and laughs. It was well acted with an easy to follow story line.
The ""bad guys"" were a little bit over the top but then again, this is a fantasy film.
I for one would love to see a follow up film although I'm not sure how they would do it.
overall a good film that adults and (older) children can enjoy."

'Accuracy to the period' wow, accurate in the actors' attitudes and the actors' outlook, a convincing travelling in time. By the film's title we expected something like 'Nana McPhee' but it was nothing so cardboard, instead tangible with delights and dangers. It was a piece that could be placed, relative to actual events and places.Art these days is rare, and that was art."
" really wanted to like this but i can't
",0.222,0.9652,2019-11-11 00:00:00,6,"I never read the books so i don't know how close the movie is to the original story. but as a movie it tries hard to be great but ends up mediocre at best. it got everything a good movie should have (according to Hollywood) and thats the problem. it follows the usual scheme of ""how to structure a movie everyone likes"". but in reality this just makes sure it isn't a complete Desaster. its hard to explain without spoiling the story but i expected much more from Tim Burton. at least some of the visuals were quite nice."
" Collage of Bizarreness
",0.0,-0.8549,2019-11-11 00:00:00,1,"This film starts with some promising concepts and hopeful plot possibilities, but is cursed with incoherent writing and overly-fanciful characterizations. I have not read the Riggs books that the ideas came from, but I imagine that the ridiculous characterizations are true to the books; and they make for a really silly, empty movie. Think Groundhog Day meets X-Men meets Alice in Wonderland meets the Walking Dead, all on magic mushrooms, trying to do way too much in 2 hours. The plotlines are so disjointed and at times incoherent, it is like watching a collage of an adolescent's LSD-laced fantasies. The 'peculiar' children are supposed to have unique, magical gifts and abilities. They come off as just being a collection of mostly benign, sometimes ugly, fanciful monsters.In the film adaptation, there are too many huge plot holes and ridiculous, pointless anomalies; shoddy, disconnected directing; missing explanations; and the usual allotment of film clichés. The ending should be fulfilling, but, like so many sloppy endings to films today, it is rushed and patched together as if the screenwriters were overdue on the deadline and were in a hurry to produce the finish.Writers in the past 20 years have gotten lazy and stupid with the onset of CGI, with tech enhancements replacing the need for coherent, meaningful plots, character development, and intelligent writing. Writers and directors seem to be saying ""Look! We've got CGI! There's no more need for thoughtful, meaningful stories and logical plot lines since we have all these cool special effects."" But I don't think any screenwriters or directors could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. The only character with any likeability is Eva Green's Miss Peregrine, and Green (Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale) manages to give her some real depth. The others are simply one-dimensional cartoons. There is just no heart to this film. The bizarre, silly characterizations and whacked out plot lines leave a soulless, empty mess."
" Nice movie but misses that touch
",-0.1154,0.9042,2019-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Miss peregrine's home for Peculiar children is a Fantasy movie directed by Tim Burton and stars Eva green, Asa Butterfield, Chris O'Dowd, Allison Janney, Rupert Everett, Terence Stamp, Ella Purnell, Judi Dench and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie is based on the novel by the same name.The start of the movie movie is nice and it's keep a good and interesting pace up till middle where it started loosing it's pace and plot.The acting is good by Eva Green but Asa Butterfield disappoints specially in the climax, the acting by rest of the cast is ok whereas talent of Judy Dench is wasted.Overall a nice movie which looses it's plot in somewhere middle."
" Hollywood Ruins Another Adaptation
",-0.4404,-0.6068,2019-10-16 00:00:00,6,"This wouldn't be a bad movie....had I not read the books. A complete slaughter of the storyline. They didn't even get the characters right! I would understand if the books were not action packed enough for Hollywood, but they kept even ME intrigued from start to finish. So sad. I was expecting so much more."
" An unpleasant mess
",-0.6808,-0.995,2019-10-05 00:00:00,1,"Not only is this a total mess of a film, but it's an unpleasant one. And that really puts me off.You see, it's a kind of a fairy tale about weird children and weird monsters that haunt them. The only problem is that the children are as monstrous as the creatures stalking them. In other words, one ends up watching abominations on the screen from beginning to end.But as I said, apart from being unpleasant, the film is a mess - in terms of storytelling. Story is both extremely convoluted and non-existent. Untangle this mess, and you have virtually no story. Also, you have no characters. Technically, there are dozens of them, but they are all wafer thin, including the protagonists. We just don't care for them. Moreover, the villain is poorly developed and comes across as useless. He isn't scary, and his motivations remain obscure. Then there is the tone, which shifts in confusing ways, something Burton is known for, unfortunately. And finally, there is the ending, which provides no payoff for the audience. It's more confusing nonsense, and I guess an attempt is made to make it romantic, but it fails abysmally.This was another attempt by Burton to create a film with a million weird and often grotesque creatures, which become so self-indulgent that it forgets all about the plot or characters. The producers really should have intervened here.All in all, I give this film zero stars. I was tricked into wasting almost two hours of my life by a director who really should have known better at this stage in his career."
" A crossbreed of ""X-Men"" and Guillermo del Toro
",0.0,0.9462,2019-09-30 00:00:00,7,"I love fairy tales and fantasy worlds, have a serious crush on Eva Green, Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, and names like Samuel L. Jackson, Judi Dench and Rupert Everett inevitably raise expectations for the film. I can not say it's bad. It has a magical atmosphere that reminded me of ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the acting is good, it's imaginative and well shot. But I'm definitely disappointed with the script. This story might have been fascinating, but instead, it was totally mediocre and unoriginal and it barely held my attention. It's good, but not great.7/10"
" All the ingredients to become a box-office hit, but the result is a major cock-up
",0.0,0.7311,2019-09-16 00:00:00,2,"Good book on which the script is based, some very fine actors as lead actors and in supporting roles and a director that used to be able to blend that into a dark but captivating movie. Somehow something has gone horribly wrong.... When the kids are chased near the end I couldn't care less if they would get caught or survive. Simply because their characters remain bland and uninteresting and therefor are impossible to relate to. Beit Harry Potter, X-men or Nanny McPhee: all these, somewhat different, movies about or with children that are ""outiders"" make you take in an interest in how their characters evolve throughout the story. Not in this one though. I had the same experience after watching the Chronicles of Narnia, so if you liked that one, this might be your cup of tea as well. But it's not mine."

However, it's impressive visuals and gripping story kept me hooked and smiling during the film. However, the pacing was all over the place and I think Jake could have had more character. I'm not sure what it's like for American audiences but Asa Butterfields American accent is really ""off putting"". I'm just so used to hearing his English accent and hearing is American accent just feels strange. Other than that he did a killer job aswel as most actors. Especially the child actors, they did extraordinary."
" Watchable, but weak
",-0.5927,0.8922,2019-08-18 00:00:00,5,"Tim Burton's latest is another family-friendly gothic adventure full of CGI effects and a tiresome plot involving stereotypical villains and their monster minions with murder in mind. It's based on a novel which appears to go out of its way to copy bits and pieces of HARRY POTTER, X-MEN and the like to tell of a children's home occupied by kids with mutant powers. Jane Goldman did the script, and critics might feel she's working on autopilot here.This is a watchable film with plenty of visual flourishes, but it does feel like Burton is trading on past glories. Established actors like Rupert Everett, Eva Green and Judi Dench are all given very little to do in order to make way for the CGI spectacle. The effects are generally good, although there's very little we haven't seen before. The JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS-inspired set-piece is my favourite moment. Asa Butterfield's hero is as weak and vapid as the actor was in HUGO, with Ella Purnell stealing all of her scenes in a sensitive performance, even if Burton has made her up to look like Christina Ricci in SLEEPY HOLLOW for some reason."

Because of some reasons, I like it.Eating children's eyes? Really? That is the way to deal with it? I find it quite disgusting. I mean they could have chosen the other way to deal with that damned white eyes problem rather than this way.What I like of this film is that living that one day over and over again. Some films show even though you turned back in time, you can't stay in the same place that you stayed the last time. But in this film, the theory is quite different. Different doesn't mean not good. As for me, it's great. At least, we can see a different view on turn-back-time thing.Overall is that except for that fact that made me disgusted, everything's great and quite enjoyable."

",0.6696,0.9914,2019-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a very good movie like Tim Burton knows how to do it! Even though I usually don't like fantasy films, I really appreciated this movie and this mixture of fantasy and adventure is very pleasant to watch whether for children or adults. The cast is also very good: Eva Green plays very well her role as miss peregrine and Samuel L. Jackson is a very good leader of the monsters. Children are played as well, especially Jake. Regarding scenery and landscapes, they are very beautiful, whether on the island of Wales or scenes shot in Belgium and Florida. The plot is very consistent: on the death of his grandfather, Jake discovered the existence of a magical place, the home of Miss Peregrine. He went on the spot and discovered a time loop on September 3rd, 1943, just before a bombing of the German army. The occupants of the house shows Jake that his power is to be able to see the monsters who want to eat the eyes of peculiar children. Only him can see those monsters, called Hollows. Miss Peregrine, the peculiar children and Jake have to get rid of the Hollows and their leader, Barron, who kidnapped Miss Peregrine in order to do an experience. I really like the scenario, which is rather logical. The special effects are also very successful, indeed the Hollows are very well made and appear real."

Not including the ""the series of unfortunate events"" style catastrophe of shove 3 books into 1 two hour movie. Two of which are in the last 30 minutes.

He just seems to get better with age, as this movie is a good indication of.The movie starts out with a boy named Jake Portman who is believed to be mentally unstable with the only person truly believing in him being his Grandfather, Abe. Abe shares with him stories of a place he'd been to as a child, a home for peculiar children with astounding abilities or powers - a safe haven of protection from the outside world. But when Jake finds his Grandfather dead and with his eyes removed, he is driven to follow in his footsteps ... to find this home himself and get closure. His psychiatrist agrees, thinking this would help Jake with his issues. Based on this recommendation, his parents reluctantly agree.When Jake arrives, the house is dilapidated and ruined - or so he thinks. When he runs into the very same children his Grandfather described to him, at the same age as they were back then, he knows there is something much deeper and hidden behind the scenes. So, he enters their world to find out what exactly is going on.This is a wonderful movie with awesome special effects, acting and cinematography. The story was well wrought and comes full circle nicely. All questions are answered satisfactorily. You are whisked away into a world of intrigue and fantastical mystery, and when you are in the ""loop"" with Jake, you don't want to leave. The characters were all developed well and had a pivotal part in the overall story.I highly recommend this movie for adults and teens alike. This is Tim Burton at his best.

" A Dark Uneven Young Adult Fantasy
",0.0,0.6374,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"24 December 2016. The tone of this young adult movie was dark and the balanced light entertainment of say Harry Potter didn't arise so that the storyline didn't really match the more serious flavor of the movie. This fusion of the television Heroes (2006)or The Lost Room (2006) themes doesn't really connect on a consistently emotional or intellectual plot level as the movie intended. This peculiar movie of peculiar children suggested an attempt by Tim Burton to replicate the dazzling innovation of Edward Scissorhands (1990), but what he achieves are snippets of some creative new gimmicks that various children can display along with horror like features. There is something fundamentally missing as might be experience in Stephen King's earlier sci fi fantasy attempt in Langoliers (1995)."

There are 3 books in the series but the movie ended leaving the audience thinking there isn't going to be a sequel. I just think if people are going to make movies based off the book - IT SHOULD FOLLOW THE BOOK. At least the major things ya know??

I rolled my eyes so hard the neighbors heard it I'm sure. There was no coherent link between one scene to another. It's just another burton movie he had to make his own. By that I mean destroy everything that made It special, and turn it into just another crappy adaptation that will be in the reruns on hbo, stars,and encore for the next decade.

" Perfect for all the family... except when it isn't.
",0.5719,0.9169,2018-08-13 00:00:00,6,"For the most part, 'Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children (2016)' plays very closely to the pretty-much patented 'young adult' formula, except for the fact that much of it skews slightly younger than you'd expect and, in the process, seems to make for excellent family fair. That's why the occasional flashes of real darkness - including some fairly grotesque monsters, a tangible sense of threat that does more than just loom and a set of villains who often literally eat the eyes of their foes on-screen - are all the more pervasive and perplexing, seeming to reduce the accessibility of a story that's honestly better suited to those it scares off. Still, there's entertainment to be had in the predictable plot and the hammy villain, played by the always energetic Samuel L. Jackson, is having more fun than any of us or the rest of the decent but generally dull cast, which really shows and adds to the enjoyment of his scenes. The picture may be a little dry overall and it can get kind of dull, but it's not bad by any stretch and is even pretty enjoyable at times, too. 6/10"

",0.4678,0.9666,2018-07-29 00:00:00,6,"For me, this film was a solid 6/10. I enjoyed the characters and the story as it developed, but by the end I had more questions than were answered. It seems like there is SO much content from the original material, and it would take a lot of skill to condense it all effectively into one two hour film. I don't think Burton achieved this. The creepy aspects are generally good, but sometimes a little reliant on familiar horror tropes. There is a child who can bring inanimate objects to life (Frankenstein style), the villains kill children and eat their eyes, and the slender man-esque monsters don't feel like especially fresh or interesting, but may appeal to a younger audience. The storytelling and plot development is not the strongest in this film, but the imagery and themes are present. Eva Green is fabulous as always, despite being a little stuck in her role as sexy goth bird foster mother and disappearing for the entire last part of the film. Overall, this is a fun film which made me want to read the books!"

I have read the books and I loved them that said I am not one to cry if a movie sails away from the book. But this was just awful. 
Tim Burton has sold out plot and story-telling to visuals and action, which I can't really blame him for as he decided to put content of 3 books into one movie. There was no character development, there was no time to get to know the main character, the relationships between characters have grown almost out of nowhere with no chemistry whatsoever. Hollowgasts that are terrifyingly strong and dangerous in the books are defeated by plastic skeletons in a 7 minute ""epic"" battle with the most boring ass carnival music in the background. I honestly cringed through the 7 minutes. Plot making zero sense, characters behave irrationally and out of character, I really find it hard to believe that the children from the book would have the courage to fight their most feared enemy after in a 2 day interval just because Jake, their hero that they've only known or 2 days gives them some sort of super courage that they can fly around and walk around invisible around fearless. Not to mention the villains, not terrifying at all, honestly Samuel Jackson's character was more cringe that Swartzenegger's villain from Batman. The plot rushed with many plotholes and loopholes to give the audience at least a bit of an understanding.And the acting. HOLY CRAP! The only good acting was the acting of Eva Green, I thought she was brilliant actually, otherwise it was just cringy and not believable at all. The main character's acting was probably worst of all followed by Emma's.I am so dissapointed, this had such a potential if only they made it into at least 2 movies and tried to develop the characters more. 
Tim Burton is no longer trying to make art, he is only trying to make money, relying on his fame and past contributions to film industry."

The characters are unique with all of their peculiar abilities, the acting is good, the cgi they used to make the monsters is pretty good despite the fact that the monsters were obvious knockoffs of Slenderman. But the romance that builds between the two protagonists is not very believable the ""climax"" wasn't anything to get that excited for, the end sequence where what's his name was basically traveling through time to get back to his friends made very little sense"

",0.2382,0.9775,2018-03-11 00:00:00,3,"After reading the book, I was super excited to watch the movie- I loved it, the characters, the bizarre yet wonderful nature of the peculiar talents -I couldn't wait to watch the movie. And yet, I felt incredibly disappointed in the first ten minutes watching the movie.
The acting was absolute garbage in my opinion, there was no emotion behind any of the characters, especially in the scene when Jake's grandfather dies- sure he looks concerned, but he shows nothing else to this and is much calmer about his grandfather dying in front of him than let on. The one-liners the children and Mr Barron have during the fight scene are actually yawn-inducing.
That and I got more pissed off than I should've that Emma and Olive's powers were swapped in the book to movie process- why? I actually loved that Emma was a hot-head (literally) in the book and that that's who Jake takes an interest with. Instead, they make Emma a lighter-than-air blonde peculiar, because she'd be more accepted as a love interest by the audience?"
" Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is...well...peculiar.
",0.0,0.6681,2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"It's safe to say I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan, I find that his imagination takes over and detracts from a story. I was worried he would do the same here. Guess what? He did. A young teenager finds his grandfather dead, his last riddling words spark Jake into unraveling the mystery to his sudden death. He eventually discovers an alternate time loop that consists of children with special powers known as 'Peculiars'. We're talking invisibility, levitation, pyro-kinetics, a boy spewing bees from his mouth and a young girl with another mouth on the back of her head. Suffice to say, this was Burton's interpretation of the X-Men. Some of these peculiarities are useful and thoroughly explored, others are just shown once. On top of this we have 'Hollows', demented creatures that desire to eat the eyes of 'Peculiars' so that they can return to human form. Hmmmm how best to describe these ghastly creatures you might ask? Easy. Slender Man! Imagination aside, Burton has crafted yet another creative world. There is no doubt he is a genius when it comes to creating fantasy realms. The problem is, he doesn't focus on developing a coherent and compelling story. Guarantee atleast 90% of the dialogue is exposition. Explaining the vast amount of rules involving time loops, alternate realities, peculiarities and the primary antagonist...it's too much! It's overstuffed. It's important to include scenes where the characters just interact naturally without having to progress the story so that we can relate to them and become emotionally invested. It started off well, and then quickly descended into explanation hell. Apart from that massive issue, this film works as a family fantasy adventure. The visual effects were pretty decent for the most part, except the 'Hollows' who were terribly animated. Performances were serviceable. Asa Butterfield struggles occasionally to act with expression, but he does hold the film. Eva Green looked the part and was the only captivating performance. Not Burton's finest, but it is watchable."
" Quite nice family movie
",0.4754,-0.9122,2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Before I start I should perhaps mention that, although I consider this a family movie, it is perhaps a bit on the scary side for the youngest member of the family. Anyway, personally I liked the movie and so did my kids. It did have time travel in it which I, in general, utterly dislike but it is a Tim Burton movie so it was already a foregone conclusion that it would be a wee bit bizarre anyway and it had Eva Green, which is one of my favorites, in it so that kind of made up for the time travel crap.The movie starts of by Jacob watching his grandfather being murdered by some mysterious being that only he can see. Of course everyone believes that he was hallucinating and so off we go with hospitals and shrinks and so on. Finally his parents allow him to travel to the island of Cairnholm in search of the mysterious Miss Peregrine.From their on we wander into the wonderful world of ""Burtonesque"" bizarreness, fantasy and general weirdness. Naturally Jacob meets Miss Peregrine and her kids. Kids who each have some peculiar talent each more weird than the other.Naturally there are a some bad guys lurking in the shadows as well. Bad guys intent on destroying Miss Peregrine's shelter and ... well, let us just say that they are not exactly concerned for the children's wellbeing. I liked the bad guys. Both in their half human form and their more scary monster form. I especially liked Samuel L. Jackson as Barron, the boss bad guy. He really made an excellent performance.The one person I did not like was Jacob's father. Apart from being a jerk he looked like he was on drugs or sleeping pills throughout the entire movie.On the whole this was perhaps not the best of Tim Burtons movies but it was still a good and enjoyable one. Decent special effects. The story worked despite the enormous paradoxes introduced by the time travel stuff. The characters did a fair performance. I did not regret the 2+ hours I spent on watching it."

I have never been particularly drawn to the world of Tim Burton but have to confess that here he displays a considerable hold over a seemingly disparate cast whilst always ensuring that the picture looked good. The beginning was intriguing, mysterious and involving. It was also well paced and we seemed to race into picture that I had feared I might sleep through. No fear of that, even if it does lapse a little in the middle, we are soon up and running for a resounding finale. My main trouble was when the film decided to take the absurd plot, time loops and all, seriously. Here I found myself glazing over and wondering if the young lady with me was following it. No worries it really doesn't seem to matter whether you believe or not, the characters are appealing, what they do amusing and it all makes for a truly exciting conclusion."

It's a good movie for the first half, with atmospheric and beautiful scenery in Wales and a group of children with special abilities ""stuck"" in 1943 the day before their house gets blown up by German bombs. Kind of like ""X-children"" but magic is involved. Jake is the grandson of Abe and Abe warned him about his special ability to see invisible monsters. He is guided by Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a shapeshifter and masquerades as Jake's female psychiatrist Dr. Golan as well. So he travels to the U.K. to the Welsh countryside to solve the mystery. Here's where it gets really bizarre and stupid: A group of these ""shifters"" perform a ridiculous science experiment (Crazy Barron plays with electricity) that turns them all into spirit vampires that must eat eyeballs to stay in human form! Jake is the only one that can see the monsters within these people and the fact that they have white eyes with no pupils. The last third of the movie zig-zags everywhere in time including 2016 at a Naval Pier. Jake finds his way back to 1943 to be with Emma (Ella Purcell as a fetching long-haired blonde). It starts out great and ends up a muddled mess with an abrupt ending. It's not one of Samuel L. Jackson's best roles, either. A very weird Tim Burton movie."

He's replaced substance and exposition with style and effects, overdoing the grossness and taking away the subtle class that made his early films completely charming. Young Jake great up with his grandfather (Terence Stamp) sharing adventurous tall tales with him, and when the old man drops dead, finds himself living them. That part of the story I can completely relate to, and while the idea is nice, the execution behind it is way off balance.The carved shrubbery from ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the bizarre monsters from ""Beetlujuice"" are utilized in various ways, but the creatures are disgusting, as are other various elements of the film. Pirate like skeletons ripped straight out of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" make this Burton's ripping off himself. It's obvious to me that Eva Green's character was meant for Helena Bonham Carter, and that other Burton regulars were replaced as well in their archetypal roles. Samuel Jackson is actually made up to resemble Beetlujuice and isn't nearly as amusing. Judi Dench gives her all as the ghost of Jake's grandmother, but is outshouted by the noisy effects.

The boy gets some clues that lead him through a time warp of sorts and he learns how this home and its inhabitants have been living in a special place in time. The interweaving of points in time and things that occur are moderately easy to keep track of but not overly engaging or compelling. The highlight of the movie is the bizarre cast of children with interesting and unexpected powers which unfortunately very few of the powers have an impact on the story. Thus is the creativity while very clever, fun and unusual felt shallow. Many of the styles did remind me of Beetlejuice, which was great. The climax of this movie also didn't feel like it fit with the carefully constructed first 2/3's. Too much glossy CGI that ran counter to the rest of the movie.

He sets with his ignorant father to a remote island where he meets the famous Miss Peregrine who will present him an unknown world which seems to fit him better than the reality he knew before. Meeting a beautiful girl makes him even more attracted to the fantastic world but there are dangers to uncover, which point directly to his deceased grandfather. He must learn his powers in that world and do his best in order to protect his potential new home. It's a fantastic world which brings an alternative to a lonely boy, facing him with a hard situation in which he must act promptly. His attempts will prove to be clumsy, to say the least, but will eventually lead to a favorable situation. If the imaginary world as a whole is a good idea, well implemented and beautifully animated, the details and especially the teenage actors are the actual let- down. The main character, despite being very clumsy in almost everything he does, he doesn't seem able to make you believe his trauma, thus making everything look superficial. I liked this movie overall despite its problems and although it gave a predictable finale, it managed somehow to keep me awake till the end."
" Disappointing and unconvincing
",-0.4939,-0.7437,2017-08-24 00:00:00,5,"I had this film on my watchlist for a long time based on a trailer I saw when it first released, but missed seeing it in the theater. I was excited to see that it was available to stream.I read the trilogy first and loved it so was curious to see how the three books would be condensed into a single film. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed and that disappointment didn't stem solely from the book-to-film transfer.While the cinematography was effective and definitely captured the mood conjured up by the books, the characters felt really flat to me, and badly cast. In particular, the characters of Emma and Miss Peregrine were not convincing. Even Jacob seemed stilted and less 'filled with wonder' about his new world than I expected. Similarly, the story line felt increasingly disjointed and unconvincing as the film progressed."

Based on his grandfather's stories, seeks to find more about his past and travels to Wales to look for the children's home where he grew up, and the headmistress Miss Peregrine. Soon, Jake discovers that the children who live there have special abilities - thus they're called Peculiar - and that his grandfather's stories were not that far-fetched as his parents wanted him to believe.I have to say first of all that I really do believe this movie should have taken a higher rating in general. Dark yet sweet, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is all in all a beautiful Tim Burton fantasy movie. Eva Green's and Samuel L. Jackson's stunning performances add up, but I have to say it does not find it's place amongst Tim Burton's masterpieces."
" Tim Burton is back, and it's about time!
",0.0,0.9939,2017-08-19 00:00:00,8,"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a freaking awesome movie. There was very little to dislike from it. Tim Burton had a bit of a stinker period in the last few years, starting with the unnecessary Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and climaxing with Dark Shadows, which was one of the dumbest films of that year. But Burton is back with Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children, a movie that serves almost as a love letter to his old films. The plot is super Tim Burtony and revolves around a massive star-studded cast full of very popular names. These people don't distract from the film at all and most of them actually become their own characters...like, you completely forget that they are even the actors at all. Even Samuel L Muthaf***in' Jackson sorta becomes his own character, and he's Samuel L Muthaf***in' Jackson! I think what really moved me about the film is the touching story that a lot of weird youths like myself could relate to. I grew up the weird shy kid who was into bands like Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Avenged Sevenfold, and Korn, and you bet I dressed like generic fanboys of those bands too. I never really had many friends living in San Antonio, and not much appealed to me besides the weird. Tim Burton was the absolute king of weird, and his films like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and of course The Nightmare Before Christmas will forever hold a place in my heart. I'm sure if Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children was made in my early childhood, I'd love it just as much as I do the others. This film is super interesting and I hope Burton makes more like it."
" Great until the Finale
",0.6249,0.9912,2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Great Actors, great Visuals, a nice Story, and a renowned director - what could possibly go wrong with a movie ?Well, almost nothing for that matter, but some things nonetheless went wrong with 'Miss Peregrine'. First, Eva Green. While it's always a pleasure to watch her, she is clearly underemployed for her possibilities, which we had the honor to witness in the series 'Penny Dreadful'. Next, the time loop concept, which is a paradox in itself - the first question that occurs is why people do not age inside a loop, despite they live a linear non-looped life. Which is practically eternal life, something that the bad guys want for themselves and do not see that they would only have to ask for nicely ? - Well its doubtful that someone like Ms. Peregrine would maintain a personal loop for those monsters... - And next, the villain is somehow colorless, even if it's Samuel L. Jackson, and even if he and his fellow Monsters do eat their victim's eyes before/while/after killing them, which (the eating) is quite graphically shown, including a big heap of extracted eyes. Which leads me to another question, who is the target audience, adults or minors ? - I also had to scratch my head about the sometimes used term 'soft parts', which in my translation only means genitals, not the eyes.But those are the smaller malfunctions. The real failure of the movie begins when it gathers speed, after (Spoiler ahead) an absolutely breathtaking scene with a sunken shipwreck that is brought to life by the children's abilities (ignoring any physics and the reason why this ship sunk, of course - where is the big hole in its bottom). Before that, the movie is quite entertaining and fulfills its purpose of introducing us to its world and its characters, never boring, though a bit slow paced. But, to add another facet, at this point every possible mystery the movie had until then, is revealed and gone, which is also disastrous for a environment that breathes mysteries. There is nothing more lurking around the corner than a bunch of monstrous not-so-much-frightening thugs.So when the movie is clearly announcing that ""now it's showtime, please fasten your seat belts"", which is after 1 hours 30 minutes (!), it actually slows down and processes the way to the end in a series of rather less impressive, less imaginative events. I had the impression that the director and writer lost their interest in their child after those one and a half hours, after they brought it to life so well. And despite the movie's anti-climatic direction, it also feels more and more hasty executed towards the end. There is also a moment which shows that the abilities of two of the children alone, if used much earlier, would have saved the day with ease.However, on the bright side is, that finally the main characters - a young boy and a girl - are sympathetic and reasonable, although some of their decisions are not quite comprehensible. While watching I thanked Burton for every minute I did not despise Jacob or Emma.And of course visuals and scenery are simply a pleasure.That I still rated it 7/10, considering all the criticism above, may show how near this was to a masterstroke."
" A total disaster! What happened to Burton?
",-0.6588,-0.6842,2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,Bad special effects; Miserable soundtrack; It's an adaptation but Burton has completely distorted the original history; There are scenes that are not contextualized (only book readers will understand); Most actors are amateurs; The movie is really boring although the book is great; Everything is bad from beginning to end...
" Appalling/ kind of pedophile after a second viewing
",0.0,-0.9812,2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"I've never read the books, but this is a terrible movie even without any expectations from it. All of these actors have talent; sadly, for this movie, it's like someone told them to act as though they weren't going to be paid. Not an ounce of inflection throughout. It's hard to like characters that seem as if they took a bottle of xanax every morning. Despite the fact that this film is based on someone else's books, you could list elements from almost every previous Tim Burton movie. It was appalling in that regard, the fact that he had to incorporate his movies into what should have been an established series brought to life with his cinematic flair. The story isn't explained well, I found myself rewinding in spots because I thought I'd missed important info, only to realize it's just not there. Plot lines are thrown in as an afterthought, taking a place behind the 'visuals'. There's nothing in the visuals you haven't seen before. Even the monsters reminded me of zombies from a Resident Evil video game from back in early 2005. And I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a children's movie with some of the scenes available. I was a bit sick to my stomach watching a dead, eyeless child that was a 'friend' of the group get manipulated like a marionette for what seems to be no reason when everyone living was able to explain what was going on, despite the secretive nature of the place. Maybe that's in the books, but I'm sure the writer would have used more finesse instead of just making it a one time shock value. I couldn't begin to comprehend why Samuel L. Jackson was a villain in a kid's movie, let alone why he was dressed as Don King. I actually think that was supposed to be an homage to George Washington Carver, as the character was a scientist, but it was a foolish mockery. I used to be a fan of Tim Burton, but I've watched the decline of his movies, and if I thought others had hit rock bottom, I would count this as now being at rock bottom and drilling. * I watched it again, to be sure of this, and the second viewing made it clear that I didn't imagine the sexualization of the kids in this film. At least 2 scenes where for no real reason, we see the blond girl's bloomers. Once was actually in front of the 'hollows' (uh, all adults). And I understand where the invisible kid needed to remove clothes to be invisible in the pub scene, though I don't know why that had to be incorporated into the dinner scene, or why after putting clothes on for dinner, he took them off again to watch movies naked on the couch with the other kids. 3 male characters have a sexual interest in the blond girl that looks to be 15 years old, at most. The character Jake even goes so far as to say that he won't kill the monsters or risk his timeline, but tells Emma 'you know the only reason I'd stay', implying her. If it's not to save her life and the rest of the children, that slims the options. The Enoch character is labeled as 'possessive', and it's apparent that the 'Emma' character had/has a thing for Jake's grandfather. Also, Jake comes back after an undetermined amount of time searching for the group for this happily ever after, with a girl that looks like 12 year old Alice. Its very cringe-worthy in its pedophile tones."
" A relatively simple movie that is well-executed
",0.0,-0.8344,2017-08-04 00:00:00,6,"""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is an American 2016 film and at this point the most recent release by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Tim Burton. This 2-hour film is based on a book by Ransom Riggs and Jane Goldman was in charge of the screenplay. The first-billed cast member is Eva Green, but the central character is played by Asa Butterfield that many of you have seen in Scorsese's ""Hugo"". Anyway back to this one here: As pretty much always with Burton, the fantasy is at the core of it all, but there is also a pretty realistic perspective and somehow with his approach Burton managed to turn squirrels and all kinds of birds into something magical, perhaps shows how fantastic they are without us even recognizing. Green did a fairly good job too I would say but I like her in almost everything, so I am a bit biased here. Same for Samuel L. Jackson, who is fun as always and the looks are also quite memorable, like a sinister Don King almost. Sadly despite a nice introduction, his villain character never gets as good as he could have. Quite a shame. And Judi Dench is in it too, but she is really wasted unfortunately in here. I wished her character could get at least a plot twist or anything at the end and we find out she is in fact evil, but nope. There are more known names in here, but the only one I want to mention really is Terence Stamp because I like him quite a bit and he is pretty decent too.Back to the title of my review, I think there is a clean structure here. First we are introduced to the protagonist, his mannerisms, his family, his struggles etc. Then we are introduced to the location in the film's title, the house where most of the crucial action plays, and all the characters living in there and finally there is the major conflict with the antagonist played by SLJ and lots of danger and action in general. Sadly, I would say this 3rd part is perhaps when the film was at its weakest as it seemed a bit to me as if they sacrificed a bit of the clean structure and compelling writing for entertainment purposes and I cannot approve of that. Had they kept the original level, I might have given it an even higher rating. While Jackson sure looked scary, I never felt the danger aspect as his henchmen were almost nonexistent in terms of both screen time and impact on the story. It's all Jackson and as we see his character stumble through the picture, it becomes obvious Burton as always made the antagonist look rather weird than pure evil, also in terms of his actions, so they would not lose the younger audiences. But they may lose many of the adults, including myself as the character was written horribly and never seems up to the challenge despite a great actor like Jackson and also the menacing looks.As a whole, there are certainly some big flaws with this film, but there are even more convincing moments in terms of acting, writing, character development and the plot in general. It's certainly one of 2016's finest in terms of fantasy. I urge you to see it and I m really sad they messed up so hard in the last third of the film. Final note: Great use of Run Rabbit Run, at least as good as in Get Out."
" Superb
",0.6249,0.9976,2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely loved every second of this film. I read the books which I loved but the film was incredible. All this people whining about power switches just don't understand cinema. Changing Emma's power to air was perfect - the love of your life that you can never quite ho0ld on to, that's drifting away from you... just perfect.I loved the casting and thought the youngest cast members were absolutely brilliant. Raffiella Chapman was exactly as I imagined Claire and so good for such a young actress. Pixie Davies was a great Bronwyn and I loved Finlay MacMillan as Enoch. Ella Purnell and Asa Butterfield were both brilliant as Emma and Jacob and I also really enjoyed Milo Parker's performance and Hayden Keeler Stone's. My only criticism would be that there wasn't quite enough of the children and the film focused so heavily on Jacob and Emma. I hope there is a sequel and I want it to bring to life the other characters who are so important in the book with all their wit and personality. Overall a brilliant film that I have watched many many times at the cinema and am loving watching again and again on Sky. Bravo Tim Burton. Bravo to all the young cast."
" A fun film with lots of excitement
",0.7579,0.9747,2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I read one person's review and have to agree that this film delivered on entertainment value. I was not bored and actually enjoyed the fast pace and interaction of all the characters. I would suggest this movie to people who are young teenagers and above and can dive into the world of fantasy. Tim Burton did a great job here and I enjoy many of his other films as well. For those who like action and fantasy, this is worth a watch!"
" A below average truly bizarre film
",0.1531,0.9926,2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"Tim Burton has always been an eccentric director so when I saw the trailer for this film I had some hope that of could be good but this film is just a pretty forgettable experience. The premise of the film sees a young boy run into a house of extraordinary children led by miss peregrine. Asa Butterfield plays Jake in this film and my goodness this is one of the !most boring plain protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. He doesn't have any interesting qualities and just complains through the majority of the movie and I just really didn't care about his character in this film which was a shame. Eva green plays miss peregrine and she is really good in this film, she is delightfully over the top and she was really fun to watch in her role. Samuel l Jackson plays he villain in this film and he is so fun to watch in this film, yes he is over the top but you can tell he is having a lot of fun in the role which oozes onto the screen. Unfortunately though I found pretty much all of the peculiar children to be bland and have nothing particularly new about them or interesting about there characters. The story has some interesting use of time travel and I found some of the lore used in the story to be particularly cool. But the actual story is pretty boring to watch, Jake has family problems that you really don't care to see and a romance that is a bit weird and that you really don't care about. The script has some pretty funny dialogue in it especially from Jackson that will make you laugh. However, the drama falls pretty flat on it's face as you really won't care about any of the dramatic situations. The style of the film is inconsistent, when with the peculiars the film is very lavish and bright and it is cool to see all of these powers. Though when you are dealing with Jakes family problems the film is very drab and dull, the pacing is an issue with this as the first half of the movie pretty much is all like this. Also to the controversy in this film, even though marketed as a family film this film should be kept away from young kids at all cost as there are some pretty terrifying things in this movie especially for young children. Overall this is a below average movie that unless you're a big fan of Tim Burton can be skipped."
" Boring,Terrible Acting. Pass!
",0.0,-0.6124,2017-07-22 00:00:00,3,"Never expected this to be a great movie. From the outset it looked like a weak knock-off of Harry Potter. But sometimes mediocre movies are decently entertaining.Unfortunately this doesn't even rise to the level of mediocre. Its just plain bad. Bad acting, bad casting, dull story. Seeing the names Tim Burton, Sam Jackson, and that hot brunette from Casino Royal, you'd be excused for assuming it would be a well put-together film. Feels like Tim Burton was handed a massive budget and just rushed through production, hiring untalented nobody actors with a few cameos from big names mixed in.If you're reading this review hoping to find justification on whether or not to sit through this movie, I'd suggest you pass on it and choose something better."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.6176,2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Accidentally got sucked in to this film, and that's a compliment. Never would have watched it by choice, and that would have been my loss. The film suffers only from a lack of character development, as each of the children could have used more of a backstory to explain things. However, the story line is captivating once the slow start is overcome. Perhaps Samuel L. Jackson is a little miscast here (especially after watching his silly turn in KINGSMEN), so luckily his screen time is minimal. The acting is pretty good all things considered, although Judi Dench is kind of wasted in this film. Overall, it's very enjoyable, however, assuming you have the ability to willing suspend your disbelief for a few hours. Don't compare this film to Harry Potter or other stories: Look at it on its own, and it's quite good."

It seems like there were or was a hidden agenda or message that never clearly got thru in this one, most confusing most of the time, good points: clear diction and eye contact, costuming and colorization also excellent.

",0.0,0.8244,2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what Tim Burton was smoking when he interpreted Ransom Rigg's book - but it certainly has produced one of the more original fantasy movies I've seen. Apart from a slightly hokey fight scene at the end that has shades of the ""Home Alone"" ambush - this is worth a watch. Can't say anything more - I'll give it away! I liked it!"

",0.1531,0.9062,2017-06-15 00:00:00,7,"I haven't read the books, so I can't talk about the differences at length. I read a comment from another reviewer who is furious about the movie, because of all the changes. You have to remember when a beloved book gets made into a film, it's almost impossible it'll meet what you had made of it in your mind.Also as this is limited (running time mostly), it won't have everything the book had. Even Peter Jacksons adaptations could not have everything Tolkien had written in his book (at least not in the version that was running in the cinemas). Having said all that I hope this prepares you in case you do want to watch this. This is light and fun (with dark themes of course) and aimed to our inner and outer child. It does a good enough job taking us away and entertain us. That's good enough in my book (no pun intended)"
" 'Peculiar' indeed.
",0.0,0.9903,2017-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Is Tim Burton's latest film trek into the wonky and wonderful perfect? Of course not; it's confusing and a little unclear, but is it the most Tim Burton we've gotten in a long while? Yes, it absolutely is.Burton handles the scary, at times out-of-bounds children's story like a professional, and what's more, like one that loves what he's working with. He takes all of the dark elements and places them under a magnifying glass to keep the creep factor and even unnerve you a little with the terrifying slender men who want the children. He brings color and magic to this world of science and science fiction, crafting a film for both children and adults.Perhaps the one flaw in this fun romp through time is the heart of the story. Are we supposed to care for Jake, (Asa Butterfield) his grandfather (Terrance Stamp), Miss Peregrine herself (Eva Green) or Emma (Ella Purnell) one of the many Peculiar Children? Though the story itself clearly follows one of these characters, it is abundantly apparent that the soul, indeed, the very life of the story flows from one of these other characters, but which one is it?Ignoring this flaw is easy at first, but once the story evolves into this heroic, horrifying and heartbreaking tale that includes death, love and redemption, it is easier to see that something is missing. And that something is the something that would have elevated this movie from good to great.All in all though, a fun family film that is reminiscent of ""The Golden Compass"" and all of the childhood magic that still lives within us all. 7.5/10"
" A great but flawed movie
",0.3716,-0.8979,2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie as I'm a fan of the x-men, but this is nothing like x-men at all. And to the IMDb reviewers who are saying that this movie is bad because it has ""horrible acting"", had ""no plot"" (????), or because it was ""boring"", that is purely subjective and does not detract most people from enjoying the movie. This movie's main weak points lies objectively in these three areas: BAD EDITING, BAD USE OF CHARACTERS/BAD STORYLINE, and CONFUSING TIME LOGIC.BAD EDITING/POST-PRODUCTION: I've noticed that there are a lack of visual or narrative cues for transitioning from the current scene to the next. This is especially evident when they travel back in time. There is basically no easy way to tell that Jake is in the present or the past unless you try hard to search for cues in the background. They should've color graded the scenes in the past to make it look more vibrant than normal — giving it that dreamy and idyllic feel. Also the scenes shot in the present are too vibrant themselves, possibly too natural even, and so it doesn't really have that cinematic vibe to it.BAD EXECUTION OF CHARACTERS/BAD STORYLINE: To me, it seems like none of these characters have mastered their powers yet. Assuming that they have more to learn, I don't understand why Miss Peregrine didn't train them to the full potential if she knew that the hollows were still out to get them. Just imagine Olive's full potential with her power, she could probably be a human flamethrower compared to the kettle heater that she is now. Granted I haven't read the story so I don't know if they can ""upgrade"" their powers, but all these characters could've had the potential to defeat all these hollows without a sweat if they've used their powers wisely.CONFUSING TIME TRAVEL LOGIC: The time travelling logic they've used in this movie doesn't make sense at all. It feels like the writers based their logic on what they think time should be, NOT on how time actually functions. Also I know that this is a fantasy sci-fi movie, but technically so was x-men and they at least had some convincing scientific theory or explanation to explain their phenomenons. The mere ""recessive gene"" explanation wasn't enough to account for all the rather complex powers the peculiars have.I think if they hired some better cinematographers that actually knew how to properly color grade a movie or how to properly frame the narrative in a non-confusing fashion, I would've enjoyed this movie just a bit more. And also those who call this movie ""trash"" are clearly having the wrong expectations."
" Perhaps the dumbest film I ever watched (all the way through)
",-0.5106,0.8228,2017-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Usually when this many of our reviewers have reviewed a film, I don't bother. But in this case I'm going to make an exception, because this may very well be the dumbest film I have ever watched. And that surprises me, because overall, I think Tim Burton (director) does some pretty good stuff.The first problem I have with this film was the acting. I was not impressed, except for perhaps Ella Purnell and Terrance Stamp. Appearances by Allison Janney (who I like) and Judi Dench (who I like) were too brief to be noteworthy. Of particular note (but on the negative side of things) was Asa Butterfield (the main character), whom I just didn't feel very convinced by; and the worst most foolish performance I have ever seen by Samuel Jackson (his Capital One credit card commercials are much better!).Then there is the lack of character development. At least for most of the peculiar children. And trust me, during the first half of the film -- which dragged like a ship's anchor in the desert -- there was plenty of time to enhance our understanding about the peculiarities of most of the peculiar children.Some of the visuals and special effects were quite good, but as usual, special effects and visuals can't carry a film, just enhance it.I don't think I've ever given a film a ""2"" rating, but I am this time."

I didn't give it a full 10 stars as I think the characters could have been developed a bit more, especially the main character, Jake. There was a bit of an emotional void with his character.The story starts with Jake in current time and place. Due to a tragedy that happened, Jake starts seeing a psychologist. Eventually his family and psychologist are on board with Jake taking a trip with his dad to Wales.Jake was very close to his grandfather and his grandfather told him astonishing tales while growing up. The trip to Wales have to do with those stories. Jake wants to find out if there is any truth to them.The story evolves and you follow Jake on his journey and his own story seeing people and things that only Jake can see. I can't say more without giving up the story. Beautiful scenes with a mysterious story make this a great watch.*Spoiler Alert* The only thing I can knock off for this was the lack of emotion and inability to know the main character better. It was still a wonderful story."
" steals too much from x-men
",-0.5106,0.9592,2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"The whole idea behind this movie is just too much like x-men and it just doesn't seem original. For example, x-men has a wise man running a school for kids with special abilities, while this movie has a wise woman running a home for kids with special abilities. And each kid has there own, unique gift. So this kid, Jake, in Florida is close to his grandfather. He finds him dead with missing eyes and sees this giant, monster creature. So Jake's dad decides to take him to Wales, a special place that his grandfather talked about. There is where he discovers a ""loop"", a door in time that allows him to go back to 1943 and meet Miss Peregrine and her special kids. What he doesn't know is that the bad guy is following him, trying to find the loop. And in case you couldn't guess, Jake has a special ability, he can see the giant creatures that suck people's eyes out. That part was rather gross, the eating of eyes so that the bad guy, Barron, and his friends can become immortal.So, of course the kids team up to battle the bad guys just like in x- men. Main difference is this film must have had a smaller budget because the special effects are not quite as good.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was worth over 2 hours of my time. I think this movie is only for teen super hero freaks, whom must see all movies about teens with supernatural powers."
" Stay Peculiar
",0.1531,0.9922,2017-06-04 00:00:00,7,"The movie is based in the first of three books, so yes, another YA novel made into movie. But! This is a Tim Burton's film, and as a Tim Burton's movie, it leaves no one indifferent, for better or worse; and in this case it is for the better. We get to enjoy his imagination creating this world for the big screen and making the audience enjoy their time in front of it.The story is well-developed, it has a good rhythm and before you know it, you are embarking yourself in a journey towards a fantasy world where you will forget about reality and just feel one more of the gang. I haven't had the opportunity to read the books (but now they are in my to read list), but there are some differences with the books, which looks like they were made on purpose so the story flows at a better path for a movie. Speaking of which, the path might look a bit slow at the beginning, when we get introduced to Jake's life and what is going on, but then it start to get faster, step by step, but faster and in a non-stop mode.Among the cast we find some familiar faces, like flawless Eva Green, also a sight for our eyes and ears, whose character reminds us a bit of the one she plays in Penny Dreadful, at least physically. But the main character of this movie is Asa Butterfield, who stole our hearts in ""The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas"" and ""The Invention of Hugo"". He is the one whose story we follow: we laugh with him, we cry with him, we get afraid with him and we enjoy this fantasy world with him.Definitely, a movie to enjoy either with your family, or alone, and to be reminded that we all are peculiar, and that does not mean a bad thing, just enjoy who you are and forget about the rest. PS: Watch out those twins!"
" Bad adaptation and cast
",-0.5423,0.9546,2017-05-28 00:00:00,4,"I know that I shouldn't expect a book made into a movie to follow the book exactly but I can say that I was very disappointed with how far it strayed from the actual plot of the book. It was almost like Tim Burton took parts of the book but tried to make it his own, while failing miserably. I honestly don't think that the casting was the best choice for this film and Asa Butterfield didn't fit his roll. His acting was sub-par and took away from the overall greatness of what the movie could have been. I also wasn't a huge fan of how Olive and Emma basically switched what they could do because if you haven't read the book, Emma can create fire with her hands and Olive can float. I did see how that part did benefit the plot progression but I also feel like it could have gone in a different direction without changing a key part of the book. I was excited to watch this movie after having finally finished the book but I found myself skipping parts of it just to get to any interesting scene. There were a lot of things that I wish would have been different to better fit how the book is, but I do understand that not all adaptations will perfectly reflect the book."

The acting was also amazing, (Eva Green) was the most performance of them, (Asa Butterfield) was good in the film he did a good job in the movie, (Samuel L.

Overall the movie was bad, the worst part in my opinion was the acting and the build up towards the emotion, whether it's the romance, the friendship, or any other emotion, you probably didn't even feel the hatred enough to kill Samuel L Jackson beside he took the Eva Green to him self. I really feel like the movie really needs longer time, the crisis and the condition faced by the character wasn't explained enough, the build up towards the character even didn't felt enough, so the emotion towards the character feels nearly as nothing. Good thing is Eva performance is the only thing that came close as natural but still her time is not nearly as enough, the story line was good (not great even perfect), lovely main female character, and that was it. The rating is basically because i was grow up with the book so kinda personal there Overall + Eva Green!!!! + It's Miss Peregrine people!!! - The actor was mostly awful the acting was too stiff (probably because most of them are children) - Bad jokes placement, no, wait, bad jokes at all - Thamuel L Thackton did his best to not say MOTHERF*CKER (not a good attempt tho) - Lack of emotions build and put up to the moviePersonally I really expect an reboot with longer version and more build up because for me that's basically what this adaptation lack of"
" Burton needs to cool it on the Burtoness

Seriously, it was like this film was made by a die-hard Tim Burton fanboy trying his absolute best to use as many Tim Burton tropisms as possible. And why is Eva Green doing an impression of Captain Jack Sparrow for the entire first half of this movie? Even Sam Jackson, who is usually on point takes a hit because of how is character acts in the film. And it is such a shame this movie su@ks because the CGI villains, the hollows look so cool. And I was also rooting for this movie because it is an original film and we get so few non-reboot and non-sequel properties nowadays. The one and maybe only thing I liked about the film is that one scene with the skeletons fighting the hollows. And for that reason alone I'm going to give the movie three more stars than I would have otherwise."

Heartily recommend seeing this.There were a couple of flaws tho. Samuel l Jackson as the villain... Uhg. Would have been far better with a skinny brit like Bill Nighy or someone with a bit more character. Also the lead (Asa Butterfield) I thought was bland. Same facial expression the whole time, and there just wasn't enough to like about him. (That ones on burton tho) The ending was also a bit rushed and could have been better explained. But I enjoyed it immensely !! Eva Green is perfect and I,m in love with her. Happy that Tim Burton makes movies ! Huhey 😀"
" Aesthetically stylish but still dripping with Burton's trite clichés
",-0.296,0.9887,2017-04-18 00:00:00,2,"Tim Burton was told early-on that his work was innovative and witty, and as such, his style has more or less remained the same for over thirty years. With the exception of his film 'Big Eyes', all of his works are these hideously campy things drenched in goth stereotypes and heavy makeup. While this may have been creative in the 1980's, it just looks like he's scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point. His Gothic style suits a certain type of story, but he has a habit of butchering the most imaginative of ideas, from Dark Shadows (once a mystifying 1970's television series) to Alice in Wonderland (that Mad Hatter gave me the creeps). Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is just another notch in his belt, and he has managed to take an eerie but quaint and beautiful children's novel, and warp it into this grotesque sideshow where we have monsters eating fake-looking plastic eyeballs, dancing theme park skeletons with dubstep music in the background, CGI effects that look like something out of a video game, lots of ""bird cr!p"" jokes, and of course all those Tim Burton trademarks, from the usual blonde, big-eyed main female lead, to the thick eyeliner, to the way in which he finds a way to make even the most dazzling of scenes feel hokey, tired or just plain stupid. I only ever read the books once, back when I was in junior high, and I don't recall them being like this at all. The old photographs which were once a plot device are nothing more than just a prop. I guess the acting was alright, although not very memorable for me (I will concede that I found that Lauren McCrostie, who plays a character reminiscent of Charlie from Stephen King's Firestarter in some ways, steals the show in her on-screen presence).Maybe I'm being too pretentious here and making too much of a judgment on the film, but I just felt like other directors could've done so much better. At over two hours in length (credits included), it seems too silly for most adults and too scary for most children. Maybe Burton was hoping for a common ground with his audience instead of targeting a specific demographic? I really don't know. I guess when you read a book, you've sort of been poisoned by that book. It gets into your mind and convinces you that nothing could ever hold a candle to the original work. But seriously, what were they thinking with this? The soundtrack is unmemorable (though to be fair, it isn't really terrible either), the scenery looks surreal and plastic despite its WWII era in Wales setting, the main character was so mundane that it was unrealistic at best, and the overuse of computer effects did nothing at all to help matters. And don't even get me started on that Enoch character and his ""puppet"" routine, which I think Burton had a little TOO much fun with. Were the cast and crew and producers high when all this was filmed? Don't get me wrong, weird isn't always bad, but there are two types of weird - there's the fun and creative kind of weird, and the campy, ridiculous, false and annoying kind of weird, the kind of weird that hipsters like even though it is more mainstream and commercialized than anything else."

" Letter to Tim Burton
",0.0,0.966,2017-04-07 00:00:00,6,"Dear Tim Burton,Thank you! Thank you for a wonderfully silly movie! Yes, you had this series of books gift wrapped for you, and a lot of fans are probably angry that you didn't take full advantage of them. Even as someone who's not read the books, I'm a bit disappointed myself (at least with the second half).The first half was really good with developing the story, atmosphere, characters, their abilities (which are visually great), and Eva Green was terrific as the title character. Whether or not they are just like the book, I will let the actual readers say for me. For the most part, the actors all are really good, even if they're not given much to work with. The person playing the main character, Jake is identifiable. The idea of the ""peculiar"" children being stuck in one time frame for years is intriguing and I wish was explored more.It's the second half of the movie where you lost me completely! Where do I start? 1) Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. He can do great characters, and at first does great shapeshifting as Jake's psychiatrist to get info. However, not only does this guy sound like he's dying to swear his head off, but he just talks and looks silly. Anytime he knocks on a door I expect to hear him say, ""Heeeere's Baron!"" Also, the bulgy eyes and mad scientist hair look outrageous. 2) The confrontation at the pier. OH MY GOSH!!!!! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! I can't watch that whole scene or say this paragraph without bursting out into laughter! One of the kids brings skeletons to life to fight off the monsters trying to destroy them! That whole scene has got to be the silliest confrontation in any PG-13 movie ever!!! Anytime I see those skeletons fighting I keep waiting to hear the ""Remains of the Day"" or ""What's This?"" songs playing in the background. I heard it wasn't in the book, so the fact that this is in the movie makes it all the more silly. Not to mention, I think that was put in to just remind the audience, ""You're watching a Tim Burton movie."" I had to pause a couple of times to laugh my lungs out, and almost could not continue; it was that hilarious! 3) How it all should have ended: Miss Peregrine keeps protecting the ""peculiar"" children from these monsters that want to eat their eyes, but later it's revealed that two of these children could turn them into stone if their faces were revealed. Why weren't they put out in front of the enemy as soon as Miss Peregrine saw signs of danger? The battle would have been over within five seconds. 4) The oh so predictable romance. I heard that in the book the main character falls for a tougher girl. Why was she downgraded here? It's cool to see her fly, but that's about it. She's barely got a character arc to her. So, even though you've angered lots of fans of the book, I'm not angry. I'm disappointed you didn't go all out dark on the story, but at the same time I found a new movie to make me laugh on a bad day. So for that I thank you. But next time, don't be tamed by Hollywood formulas, especially when adapting an original idea. Thank you, Bonnie"
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.9007,2017-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Having seen the trailer, I had expected something delightful, fantastical and otherworldly. Sadly, the fantastic element is only a thin veneer over an otherwise mediocre, formulaic action movie. It's not terrible and it's entertaining enough to wile a way a rainy Sunday afternoon with the kids, but I wouldn't bother watching it a second time. Certainly didn't live up to my expectations."
" Two hours of chaotic meaningless CGI and special effects
",-0.5267,0.9,2017-03-31 00:00:00,3,"This movie's title and trailers made it look really interesting to me, but it was a big disappointment. The special effects and film production were great, but that's all that can be said good of this film. The story, plot, and characters are just a mishmash of bizarre convoluted nonsense. To put it bluntly, the story is just plain stupid from beginning to end, even for a children's fantasy. If you were to ask me about the acting in this film, it'd be hard to answer because there really aren't any scenes with enough coherent dialog for any serious acting. This movie is best described as two boring hours of chaotic meaningless CGI and special effects. My recommendation, even to children, is don't waste your time and money on this let-down.This movie is a substandard effort by Tim Burton. His movies are never mainstream Hollywood, and are a bit quirky, but they usually do have a degree of quality in the story, script, and art, as well as the special effects. But not this one. I'm beginning to think I'm correct about aging great movie directors/producers, like Ridley Scott (Prometheus). I think they decide to rake in a load of retirement money by cashing in on the huge demographic of young and dumb 12-year-old movie goers. The film makers abandon their usual standards, and make brainless CGI action blockbusters for the big PG movie dollars. Well.. maybe sometimes you can't blame them."

See, to suicide squad I didn't develop any expectation, but to this movie I did. I was sure the characters will be compelling, interesting, not stupid etc etc etc. I couldn't be more wrong.Right off the bat, we see the stereotypical social-anxiety type of hero- No, should I say protagonist. He sure is no hero. Anyways, we see him in one of the most cliché' kind of openings - Him saying something to a pretty girl and she not responding since he's lame & unattractive. That was the moment I gave up on the movie. A few minutes in and that's it. But I kept watching, since I was with friends at the time. As the story progresses, I learn to hate the main character more and more because he is so lame and stereotypical. Even the bullies, who guided him in the wrong way, are stereotypical and predictable.When we saw his love interest in the movie for the first time, it was predictable it was her. There was no development to that. They missed a few steps.Somewhere in the end of the middle of the movie, suddenly our clumsy, social-anxiety'd, scared as a toddler protagonist takes the initiative and becomes the charismatic leader. Which was also predictable. I don't mind this movie being predictable as hell, OK? The problem is EVERYTHING in this movie misses development, steps towards the goal. They just skip into it instead letting the characters develop. I couldn't finish the movie, I forced my friends to switch the movie.One of the worst movies I have ever watched in my entire life.

Asked to sort out a movie for them to watch,I remembered seeing enchanting clips for a Fantasy Steam Punk movie, (genres which her son is a fan of) which led to me finding out how peculiar these children could be.The plot:Being close to him during childhood,Jake would hear stories from his uncle Abe about spending time with at Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,and joining Peregrine and her children in fighting monsters during WWII. Going to visit Abe,Jake finds him with his eyes missing,and is told by Abe in his dying breath that he must go and find Pergerine in WWII. Convincing his dad Franklin to take him to where Abe claims the Home is,Jake finds himself entering a peculiar time loop.View on the film:Crossing the hands of time between 2016 and 1943,director Tim Burton & cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel unwrap a delicious blend of dark Fantasy and ultra-stylised Stream Punk. Entering Peregrine's Home,Burton decorates the surroundings with lush candle wax Gothic colours giving the playful skills of Peregrine's Children an underlying atmosphere of horror. Crossing swords with a great Ray Harryhausen tribute,Burton links his Gothic cool with a startling Steam Punk edge,lit by the slo-mo bombs of WWII,and welded by Burton using the ""out of time"" Blackpool Tower to give the flight of fantasy a metallic shine.Turning time in adapting Ransom Riggs's book to a swift 2 hours,the screenplay by Jane Goldman opens up its own loops in time,via being rather vague on the passage of time,and Franklin just being forgotten about! While these flaws do glare,Goldman sweeps over them with delightful dips focusing on the ""peculiar"" aspects of Burton's outcasts,and the mix of Fantasy and Steam Punk allowing Goldman to tie a ship sailing romance with a sharply bitter,eye-gauging dark Fantasy. Welcoming Asa Butterfield's Jake,the beautiful Eva Green dazzles as Peregrine,thanks to Green gliding round the eye-catching costumes and props,whilst also expressing a considerate care for Miss Peregrine's peculiar children."

The character development was alright for what they had, but still pretty sloppy as a whole. 2. The story didn't really get you into it if you haven't read the book such as myself. It takes a while for you to get into it in that standard, probably about thirty to forty minutes or so.3. The action is a little bland. It doesn't really feel like there is any stakes at all. 4. The chemistry of the characters is very hit or miss. Some work out, some don't. Overall, it is a alright movie. Well acted, entertaining, but not well story driven or character driven. A average 5/10 effort is my verdict."
" Best Tim Burton film in a long time
",0.6369,0.9726,2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is Tim Burton's best film in a while and it has everything you expect from a good film of his, including amazing Gothic-like special effects and aesthetics and a unique style. As a big fan of the book, I enjoyed seeing many characters and ideas transfers over into the big screen from the pages. The cast was very good for the most part, with Eva Green giving a truly terrific turn as Miss Peregrine. This film did take some liberties from the book, however, and changed many aspects of it (especially things that happened towards the end), but for the most part it transfers what made the book special and is a promising sign for the rest of Tim Burton's directorial career."

I don't know if children will enjoy this movie, though I guess that wasn't what the film makers where aiming for. The story is interesting, though kind of confusing, especially when dealing with the loop holes and all. But all in all, satisfying enough, with a solid villain, a happy ending and a strong final battle scene. The performances were really good, however the romance was weak. I mean, I could see the girl being attracted to the boy, but the guy seemed to have no chemistry with her, more like he was awkward around her. One other thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack, especially the one during the action scene (reminded me of an amusement park music). Finally, some of the special effects looked fake, though maybe they looked better in 3D. So, 4 out of 10."
" Another Burton Fumble...
",0.0,0.9862,2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Thank God I got tickets to this abomination they call a movie on a promo for free. I won't even need to give out spoilers to rate this joke as quite possibly the worst 2 hours of my life I wasted. The only productive part of me being there was that it's super hot in Islamabad right now and the movie theater was very comfortable and air conditioned and the best 20 minutes of this film was the 20 minutes I fell asleep about 30 minutes into the movie. When my girlfriend woke me because I was snoring too loud, I didn't miss anything of significance. Where shall I begin...From the opening scene, it was quite obvious I should have stayed home picking lint balls off my old socks since that would have been much more exciting and worthwhile than to watch this rubbish.Every attempt at filmmaking was predictable and I felt like Nostradamus reborn as I was telling my girlfriend everything that was going to happen right before it happened and all she could do was giggle and chuckle. In fact, there was so much giggling and just plain ridicule laughter going on in the theater you'd think it was a comedy. In fact, if I were to have been told that this was a children's horror suspense film, I might have given it another star as almost every suspense or plot twist scene was laughable. The final scene was enough that I almost regurgitated my 5,000 telats hot dog, only because I was laughing so hard at the shear ridiculousness of it all. When it was all over, everyone just sat there dazed and most were probably thinking what I was thinking...even though it was free, what 8 million other things I could have been doing in these 2 hours of my life I will never get back."

When I heard Tim Burton was making it I loved the idea of eerie dreamlike music and odd but beautiful imagery. The book itself is creepy at times but the film almost overdid this, instead of Burton's almost subtle horror; certain scenes were almost grotesque and reminded me of low budget horror. The film itself was actually pretty good as a standalone but as a Tim Burton film based on the Ransom Riggs novels it was somewhat disappointing"

",0.7184,0.8883,2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"If I have read a good book, and they make a movie based on that book, I look forward to seeing the movie. I very much enjoyed the book this movie was based on. I thought the movie was okay.I understand that movies can seldom be made to follow the book exactly. But this movie was pretty far removed from the book. If it were any further removed from the book it would have become a ""separate story taking place in Miss Peregrine's universe.""That having been said, it was still entertaining."
" ""As I was saying, some people are peculiar.""
",0.0,0.8263,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm surprised at the relatively low rating for this picture, 6.8 as I write this, and not quite a year since it's original release date. The story has some of the magical qualities of the Harry Potter series, and the fanciful whimsy of Burton's own ""Big Fish"" and going back even earlier, ""Edward Scissorhands"". After reading some of the negative reviews on this board, I chalk that up to the film's uneven treatment of the series of books on which the movie was based. I'm not familiar with them myself, so I imagine my own rating would have been lower if I was invested in the story and the characters. On the face of it though, I liked the imagination and creativity put into the characters of the peculiar children in the story, and the time loop element was rather unique as well. The acting seemed a little stiff though, it probably would have helped if there were more humorous interactions between the players. The business of the Hollows consuming human eyes to attain humanity and immortality was a bit grim, but on the flip side, the special effects involved were fairly imaginative, particularly during the skeleton battle against the monsters. So all in all I wasn't put off like a lot of viewers seemed to be, and the movie seems to be a pretty good candidate to watch with one's family so the kiddies can get a look at a whimsical adventure that can fire up their own imagination."

Of course, a lot changed from the book, from Emma's powers to Miss Peregrine being so young and chirpy to several other details, not to mention things that just sounded silly and without any purpose other than get the characters to do something or get the story to proceed in a certain manner. But mainly many things felt rushed. Some things were just plain dumped which could have worked well and in some instances did, in others it didn't. Also, if there is one thing that makes me cringe it is insta-love.Tim Burton created a new character only because he wanted to work with Samuel L. Jackson. This could have been a really good thing, if played right. However, the bad guys in the book were so much scarier. This dude had the potential to be terrifying and he only managed to do so in the first scenes when he didn't spoke. Then he just came across as silly, at least to me.Hey, it's still a Tim Burton movie. Awesome CGI, sound effects, etc, etc. Lots of clichés as well. As usual, if you have not read the book you will enjoy it a lot more.It was pretty good, not awesome. And I have the feeling the ending is going to ruin the next two books of the series for me which remain unread.Bottom line, please read the book."
" Too dark for kids, Too kiddie for Adults
",0.0,-0.6128,2017-02-24 00:00:00,5,"I'm voting this one right in the middle, 5/10, mainly because I quite enjoyed the first half of this movie.I'm enjoying seeing Eva Green in movies so much more these days, much more so than in Casino Royale where I felt she was really trying to channel Cate Blanchett.I really felt that Tim Burton (and writers) should have paid more attention to the time lines (since time travel\bubbles were a significant plot point), particularly when Grandpa Abe is suddenly alive again after them killing Baron...when they killed the same Baron later in his time line, not an earlier Baron.IE all the consequences of Baron's actions would still be current after he died. There were other discrepancies, but this was the most glaring to me.Another reviewer also mentioned the Skeleton Crew vs the Holos. What the hell? Enoch's whole character was like a Nickelodeon kid- villain, the animated elephant he used to rescue his damsel took ages and was no substitute for hitting the dude over the head with something. This whole group of scenes was way too child-viewing for the rest of the film, half of which would give children nightmares.I feel like this movie could have been brilliant, but was let down by silly oversights and poor attention to who the target viewers were, with inconsistencies in the content as a result.Also, most of the younger cast, including Asa Butterfield were a bit lack-lustre in performance."
" Not quite up to Burton's best, but also not a let-down.
",0.3818,0.9932,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"It's not hard to see, what of this story captured the attention of one of Hollywoods greatest storytellers. Tim Burton always had a soft spot for the outsiders, the misfits and, well, the peculiars of this world. And Miss Peregrine just has a full bunch of them. So, what could go wrong with this director on such a tailor-made project?As it turns out: A couple of things. It's been quite a while now, that Burton delivered a movie, that has the magic, while also emotional qualities of his early works. You can't help but think of Edward Scissorhands while watching this movie. At last he would have been a perfect fit in this group of not extraordinary, gentlemen but kids. These kids are overseen by Miss Peregrine, a governess-like figure, superbly portrayed by Eva Green. She cannot only transform herself into a falcon, but also manipulate times. With that ability, she creates a so called ""loop"", which puts her and the kids in a groundhog day situation. They relive the same day over and over again, which keeps them from aging, but also away from the real world. Thus, they are safe from any threats to them, of which the most dangerous are the ""Hollows"": invisible, eye-eating monsters from some Guillermo del Toro movie. In comes Asa Butterfields character Jacob, who is the only one, who can see and hence kill those creatures, an ability, he inherited from his grandfather. He once lived in Miss Peregrine's home, as well, but left to go after the Hollows. It's his mysterious death right at the beginning of the movie, that sets the whole thing in motion. There sure is a great, fantastical movie in here somewhere, and we get a glimpse of it in the first half, when Burton introduces his child/teenage characters. A girl, that is so fragile, you literally have to hold her tight to keep her from floating away. A young man, who can give live to his own weird, creepy dolls. A boy, who can project his dreams through his eye onto a wall. It almost seems, as if each of the characters in the movie represent a certain aspect of the director's personality. For Burton aficionados, there's a lot to love and discover and I'm pretty sure, this is the part to which Burton felt most dedicated to. The movie collapses, when it comes to the third act. The whole story about time loops didn't seem very plausible in the first place, but it becomes even more confusing, when we learn about the origins of the evil Hollows and the group behind them. They are led by Samuel L. Jackson, who stands in for Johnny Depp to deliver yet another completely ludicrous performance in a Burton movie. There are a couple of very chilling moments in the film, especially in the first part of it. But this sense of creepiness is entirely washed away by SLJ's cheesy performance. He acts like a bad parody of ""The Joker"" and just goes full-on to chew every scene. At no time did I take him for a serious villain. I really felt like Burton had no interest whatsoever in this character or any of the stuff outside of Miss Peregrine's home. So, I liked a lot about this movie, notably Eva Greens performance, the references to previous Burton works. The children characters also worked well. They are not just young X-Men with superpowers, it's more like they don't really know what to do with their talents. I found this very credible and I think, that young adults can relate to that aspect. On the other hand the teenage romance didn't work as good as it might should have, but at least it didn't bother me. So, unfortunately the movie doesn't hold up to its promising opening. It wasn't a disappointment at all. But neither was it up to Burton's best works."
" This is a movie worth watching, even if it's not perfect!
",-0.3378,0.9981,2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a refreshing new fantasy that had me interested throughout. It's far from perfect, but it seems to overcome its flaws. To provide some background, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a movie based on a book with the same title. The book is a bit quirky, so naturally the movie is too! This is where hiring Tim Burton really paid off. He directed the film, and although his movies are usually more creepy and strange than I like, his influence was just what the movie needed. Everything from the plot to the costumes has just an edge of Tim Burton's maniacal genius, and it makes this movie pop! To be brief, the movie centers around one teenage boy discovering the secrets of his recently deceased grandfather. His journey leads him to meet a group of children, each with a special power, or peculiarity. He learns that monsters are after them all, and decides to help out. Throughout the movie, he begins to discover his own peculiarity. His abilities, and the changes it presents, are central to the movie's story. Recent fantasy movies such as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them or The BFG have been good, but missing something. It is my opinion that these movies were teetering on the edge of cliché. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is anything but that, as it somehow mixes time travel, two time periods, magic, the relationship of a father and son, and an interesting conflict. The characters also offer a great mixture of evil, comedy, and emotion. The highlights of this movie stem from interaction between the main characters. For example, the main protagonist's father, Frank (Chris O'Dowd), is absolutely hilarious talking to his son. He plays the part of ""clueless dad"" and offers great comedic relief. Throughout the story, he just assumes his son is slightly unhinged whenever he starts talking about the magical events that unfold. He still shows some care for his son though, preventing us from considering him an antagonist. Another example of the great character interaction is Miss Peregrine (Eva Green). She nails the ""eccentric and witty, slightly snappy, but caring"" attitude that I'm sure the writers were aiming for. Every time she talks with one of the characters, she's giving some strong advice without seeming too stereotypical mentor. The movie is not without its flaws, however. Like most big-screen adaptations, the movie fails to capture the entire book. The time travel aspect is slightly confusing at times, and Enoch (Finlay MacMillan), one of the main characters, seems to play no other role in the plot than to annoy the audience with his brooding character. Still, if you look at the sheer number of characters and plot elements that were pulled off, the movie succeeds. All in all, this movie has a few issues that make it less than perfect, but it still impresses the casual watcher. Some may think that it is too strange or random to be good, but this actually lends itself as a strength as the movie progresses. The eccentricity of the movie as a whole makes it something you won't forget for a long while. If you're unsure, I would invite you to give this movie a try. It's certainly worth checking out!"
" Vanilla or Frankenstein
",0.0,0.9404,2017-02-17 00:00:00,3,I am not sure whether to describe my view of the movie as a vanilla or Frankenstein. The movie was very plain and without excitement. I could say with confidence that the entire movie was quite predictable and done before. That brings us to Frankenstein. The movie craftsmanship itself seems like it was directed to be a bit of every other popular movie plots. The love story seems like a remake of time traveling movie. The creatures seem to be a bit part of Harry Potter and some other movies. It certainly did not seem to be adding much creativity to plots that seems very reused.

Stop...I'm too sad to write something else. IMDb tells me i got write more lines for my review to be submitted...i can't understand why but i'll do. There are so many ""logical"" issues that i can't even count them, and i love fantasy and sci-fi movies. IN a few words there no cause-effect, that is the only thing that a fantasy got to have.

My son, also immensely enjoyed the books and read them as quickly; and my daughter had heard us continuously talking about how good the books were. The movie had so much potential, but sadly left both myself and my children disappointed. Eva Green is mesmerizing as always, but why oh why re-write an excellent story into a hotch-potch of ideas that don't work as well as the original? Was such a drastic re-write necessary? It's not as if modern film making methods couldn't have coped with the magic of the book. The beauty of the original story was lost, rushed and slightly non-sensical in parts.

The movie was very fun to watch and the plot was quite interesting, hoping that there will be a part two.And to anyone open enough to watch a movie and not have expectations of Tim Burton's other movies I say you give this a go, it is quite different from most movies from the director."

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

This movie is an example of how to take a million short-cuts in story telling to achieve an outcome or something that represents a complete a story. This movie takes the super- hero/time-travel genre, and injects it with steroids, and in the end, it just doesn't work well at all. I had little respect for Burton's ability to bring a story to the full screen, and after watching this piece of garbage, I have even less .... I don't care how much it pulled in at the box office, I would think any director and/or screen writer who has any artistic integrity, or just plain common sense, would NOT want this movie on their resume.Rather than watch this movie, time would be better spent by painting a wall and watching it dry."

Peculiar was right to the spot as a word cause that's what these kids were in the end. The movie was really Tim Burtonish, which is a good thing always!

There are so many disturbing scenes in this movie, not just disturbing violent but also some very weird, creepy and very dark themes that even most adults would find alarming. I am an adult and very disturbed by this movie. Parents should be very careful these days because even cartoons now have many adult oriented themes that filmmakers like to inject here and there. I'm very saddened that they involved underage actors in making this movie. It's just wrong. If this is acceptable these days then the morality of our society as a whole is definitely going down.

" We're not the same (or are we?)
",0.0,0.976,2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"First, I should admit that I've never read the book on which ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is based. I had never even heard of it until the movie got released. I understand that the movie changed some things, but on its own, it's a fun movie. After an unusual turn with ""Big Eyes"" (one of his best movies), Tim Burton returns to focusing on misfits with this one.I saw connections to some of Burton's previous movies. There's the issue of the veracity of an elder's stories (Big Fish) and the role that the ""strange"" people can play in stopping a potential threat (Beetlejuice). But more than anything, it's a nice, enjoyable movie. Criticism that I read was the casting of Samuel L. Jackson - the only non-white cast member - as the villain. Maybe so, but he's the sort of person who can make any character cool (and he doesn't even have to use the word that he tends to use in every role). I'd like to eventually read the book.Not a great movie, but fun."

He doesn't even shape-shift. He wasn't black. He was a Nazi. Enoch was a pudgy little roley-poley that had NO ROMANTIC INTEREST OF CONSEQUENCE. Olive was WAYY younger, and SHE was the girl that was lighter than air. And no magical super wind. For the love of god. Everything about this movie was shameful. The characters were revised to death, the story was garbled, and quite honestly, the acting and effects were cheesy. Not even worth the dollar rental at Redbox.

Jackson shows up and in every single scene from this midpoint to the end, delivers nothing but terrible acting, horrible puns and a general sense that the supposedly life-or-death struggle being presented in the screen is a joke.By the time of the climatic final fight, you will be face-palming at the utter stupidity of the antagonists, one dies from not looking both ways while crossing a street ( i wish i was making this up ), while Jackson is still cracking unfunny jokes at the children even after they killed virtually all of his henchmen.This movie also suffers from schizophrenic rating syndrome, it has disgusting gore that no children under 12 would stomach seeing yet the villain is such an imbecile nobody over that same age would take him seriously."

I won't lie - i didn't understand part of what were going on during the second part of this movie. And it was rated PG-13 with all the ""eyes eating stuff?"", this is not a movie for the youngest ones. Overall, ""Miss Peregrine's Home"" is a disappointment. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it is a very mixed bag. There were many plot elements that could have been made into a TV series, not a 2 hours long movie because by the end i just didn't care what was going on to be honest. While special effects were good and overall craftsmanship of this movie is also first rate, the script in here was its biggest weakness - it wasn't written by Tim Burton, so its not his fault that this movie fail to deliver. They needed to make the story more tight. And were did Judi Dench gone during this movie? Who was her character anyway? If a script can not engage a viewer in the story even after Judi Dench appears on screen then the film has some real problems."

",0.3818,0.9984,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Idk how the budget looked for this movie but it seems to me they didn't have as much as they should've to be able to make this a truly great movie. Acting was done well, the kids who had been willingly trapped in a certain time period and unable to have many new experiences were very eager to have fun with the new person in their house, and overall acted as awkward and clever as one would imagine from kids living like this. The main character, Jake, was made fun of, had uncaring jack wagons for parents and was thought to be crazy and to love his grandpa to the point of worship. As such he had little confidence but actually had a great mind for things, he uncomfortable with people being so eager to be with him, but also grateful to them for it.However a lot was lost in the lack of character development. Movies that are two hours long would be thought to have amazing character development but as it took a forth of the movie to introduce the major characters other than Jake a lot of opportunity was missed there. Movies that have in depth stories in their original material really have a lot to put out but almost all of the scenes felt very rushed so it was hard to really love any of the characters for the little quirks they had.Another thing the film was lacking in was the CG scenes. In a fantasy story like this CG is necessary, but it seems to me their budget was severely cut in this department as the effects (such as the scenes where the boat is emptied of water, the ones involving Enok's hearts bringing things to life and really all of the scene cuts seemed to be timed terribly) which is honestly where I'm taking points off from a perfect ten. Fantas movies are meant to give a sense of wonder at the world that's taking shape in front of you, but with the lack of skill in these things I really wasn't feeling it as much as I'd like to have.Ovetall this movie was great and I don't regret watching it. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't analyze movies too much and just enjoys them for their face value. However if you want a good fantasy movie there are most certainly better ones out there."

Each visit strengthens his bond with Green and her charges, especially for a floating, teen girl.

It may be a bit too much for little kiddies, so parents beware.""M.P.H.F.P.C."" gets a mediocre grade because it has too many shenanigans. Some of the peculiar children have powers that can devastate an enemy quickly, yet they don't take advantage of them or they wait until the last minute to use them. Granted, some are little kids and have never been in combat, but the older children could have easily instructed the little ones on how and when to use their deadly powers. **SPOILER ALERT** One older child (I'm being nice here, because she looks like she is 25-years-old) has the power to generate so much oxygen from her body that she can float a sunken ship, yet she can only put out about 20 seconds of air to pin the lead monster against a wall, after which the monster is free to do more damage?

Eva Green and Samuel L Jackson do a fine job of portraying eccentric characters that couldn't possibly exist in the real world, and contrast nicely with the bland, everyday-ness of Asa Butterfield and Chris O'Dowd (who deserved better, frankly).My grip with Miss Peregrine is the same as it is with most fantastical movies made for a mainstream audience -- the film-makers have assumed that because it is fantastical, there is no need for it to make any kind of sense at all. There's nothing wrong with having an invisible boy or a girl with teeth in the back of her head as story elements, but effect still has to follow cause, and the basic principles of logic still have to apply. Otherwise you might just as well end the story with ""and then he woke up."" People still have to act like people, unless there is a good reason why they don't.Any story involving time travel needs to be handled very carefully, because the paradoxes involved easily lead to a stupid, meaningless plot. It needs to be explained how a teen-aged boy can be romantically involved with a woman of ninety who just happens, by some quirk of time travel, to look like a kid. I'm prepared to suspend disbelief to the extent of women who can turn into birds, but I'm not prepared to believe -- even for the purposes of storytelling -- that a person can live ninety years in a repeated day during the Blitz and still have the mannerisms and emotional reactions of an adolescent. Not without some explanation, anyway.Unfortunately, the movie is full of jarring oddities like this. Film-makers really ought to credit their audiences with at least enough intelligence to know when a plot makes no sense whatsoever."

HOWEVER, the movie was a MAJOR disappointment. I think people who have not read the book will enjoy it, because they wouldn't know what to expect, but for the book readers this adaptation is a slap in the face! SO many things have been changed. Emma's peculiarity is swapped with Olive's. Olive was meant to be younger, maybe 10 years old, but she is the same age as Jacob. Fiona was supposed to be older with big, bushy hair, but of course she was not. She had a love interest with Hugh in the book, but I guess they changed that with Olive and Enoch. Miss Peregrine's character was not right... Should have been someone like Angelina Jolie in Maleficent. And THE ENDING.. It was COMPLETELY changed. But I must admit the ending was a little more entertaining than the book because all the children worked together to save Miss Peregrine.Another major flaw to this movie was the ACTING. Especially the protagonist, Jacob. There was absolutely no emotion or connection. It was so uncomfortable to watch. Especially since Asa Butterfield has been so great in other movies like 'Hugo'. I really hope this movie gets a remake in the future because the book is absolutely amazing. The movie definitely didn't do the book justice. The movie could have been so much more, but it was all so average and 'meh'."

Emma and Olive are switched which I really didn't care for because Emma's warmth is what got him through most of his hard times, her fire was fueled by anger which is a HUGE part of the fight. Floating doesn't have near the same effect.They also cut out a big part which is Abe's best friend, he made him Abe seem more personable. He was there when get found his grandfather and made the ""no trust"" issue more intense because even his best friend didn't believe him.There are so many things that don't add up...important things. I get changing a couple of things and making it your own, OK that's fine. This book was basically re written when it was one of the best books I've read since Alice in Wonderland. I'm heartbroken as Tim Burton is my favorite director...I'm disappointed :("
" Excellent entertainment for adventurous hearts
",0.836,0.8555,2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"C'mon guys, it's a good one. Well written, steady pace, smooth dialogue, fresh characters, nothing over-explained - what else did you want? Another abusive romance between Eva Green so you could see her naked again? Sorry boys, not in this one! She's matured.For me it was excellent entertainment. It worked it's magic on me on so many levels, and gave me exciting experiences I'm not able to have any other way. The scene was set right at my home theater: kids away with their other family members, just me and my sweetie having a watch without distractions or expectations. My old trusted 55"" Philips 3D TV and a pair of glasses, and we were ready to go on a journey. And what a ride it was! Having not read anything about the movie or the book before, everything came as a surprise. And this story is full of imagination, mind-tingling twists and careful details not commonly used in other movies. Not that I even finish so many movies nowadays because I tend to get bored or anxious with most modern action/fantasy efforts, but this one brought perfect balance between light and dark fantasy, and emotion-wise delivered both warm ecstasy and chilling horror. I especially enjoyed the scene where Emma was taking Jake to her secret hideout. Magnificent!Watching the box office reports I'm amazed how much money is made with dull and ridiculous high-budget movies, and seeing this one underperforming. Also considering how highly many dark, depressive, overly violent and serious films are rated here, it's sad to see Miss Peregrine having a relatively low overall score.In my books it's the movie of the year 2016 and it's only natural to give it 10 / 10."
" Could be much better, and Tim Burton is losing his hand in the direction.
",0.5423,0.9867,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"It became fashionable to make book adaptations, be it fantasy, romance, or drama, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is based on a fantasy book that is very reminiscent of the X-Men, we had many good books-based movies, the fantastic The Trilogy Lord of the Rings, and the great Harry Potter saga, and we had bad ones too, like Twilight, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is half-way, not bad, but could be a lot better, the truth that Tim Burton is Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is very little of what he is capable of, the cast is good, Eva Green is as good as ever, Asa Butterfield is OK, Samuel L. Jackson is very well, and so is the picture, and the soundtrack is forgetful, the script has problems, Burton's direction loses a lot in the progress of the film, I hope the sequence (if of course) is much better.

" A really though movie to watch
",0.0,0.9757,2017-01-08 00:00:00,2,"Wow, this movie really made me lose faith in some movie makers. The continuity errors are so many and so grave it's hard to not get frustrated while watching. The director, editor and script supervisor should have worked closer together so these mistakes wouldn't happen.I haven't read the books and don't know the storyline beforehand. The script wasn't that bad I guess but they didn't give the movie a feeling. The acting was very flat and I got the feeling they put so many famous actors as possible in the movie to attract the adult viewers to the cinema. Everything felt so rushed all the time and there was to many exposition moments. When miss Peregrine shows Jake around the home there is just exposition and it was so bad it was hard to watch.The movie was so bad I couldn't even enjoy the acting from O'Dowd or Stamp. The cinematography was often good and I don't have anything bad to say about the sound or music. It's hard to direct kids i bet so you can't really blame the kids for their lack of acting. Sometimes enjoyable to watch but mostly a mess.Looking forward to the reboot in 10 years! :D"
" It's nice.
",0.4215,-0.8012,2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"In times where any notion of people being different in a film tends to go along the lines of ""Imma firin mah Lazor"" it certainly is refreshing to revert to actual fantasy. The subtleties in everything, the colours slightly off, the 'different' familiar and grotesque, dreamy and dreadful: it's why we love Tim Burton. More timeless and classy than any X-Men could ever be. Glimmering moments, just shy of being key to anything, offer their full heart to enchant us onlookers. Now that's all fine & proper but somehow it is off. Or perhaps, speaking of Burton, not off enough, if that makes any sense. Something's missing anyway. Tim Burton convinced me of his mastery with many memorable films, until directing the second-most disappointing film of all times (after Star Wars Episode I): Alice in Wonderland. He appears to fall into routines. Then again even the storytelling deteriorated steeply, to the point where even the routines were off. Alice was plain horrible. This film is not horrible but it also isn't what I hoped for. It isn't radiating the heartfelt bittersweet Tim Burton so aptly summoned throughout his career. The story is some sloppy, interchangeable standard. The characters sparkle here and there yet never come to shine. He did not pour his heart into this one it appears.Also, as an Eva Green fanboy, I know what she's capable of. Tim Burton didn't use her to her fullest, didn't allow her to consume us, the children or a mediocre Tim Burton. She went starving. Eva Green sure plays her part well nonetheless, nuanced and shiny in broken perfection. It's just that this whole film is incomplete, done in halves. Specifically as an admirer of Burton's works I need to conclude: this is not it.""Do. Or do not. There is no try."" - Master Yoda"
" very disappointed
",-0.5256,0.6662,2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,Wonderful Book... loved it so much I read it twice.I was a little disappointed at first and thoroughly disgusted by the end.. I know movies never exactly follow the book but this was downright offensive..Tim Burton what did you do? First of all Eva Green though a fantastic actress (terrific in Penny Dreadful)was badly miscast as Ms Peregrine Too young too glamorous and way to coy throughout the movie The main character had been in love with the fire girl but alas no more..now the weightless girl..WHY?.they changed up so much by the middle of the movie it was unrecognizable They escaped by rowboat not by a derelict cruise ship for heavens sake Someone should make this book into a movie..Burton failed.
" Enjoyable, but not quite good
",-0.3578,-0.99,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Short and on the point: I liked Eva Green. She showed she can play good characters too. Samuel L. Jackson had nothing to do with his role. The actor is good, but he did not have material to work with. Which brings us to the main problem: the bad guys are WEAK. Plain weak. Why should anyone be afraid of a creature who dies from a crossbow bolt, like a normal human? I don't care if it's 4 meters tall, has tentacles in it's mouth and is invisible...it dies like a human! The bad guys cannot accomplish anything on the grand scale, they can be killed by a guy wielding a shotgun! Or by a boy with a crossbow. Come on! These were by far the worse bad guys I have seen in a movie. The children were much more powerful than the ghasts and the main antagonist had no useful super-power. He could transform his arm into a hatchet...really useful, yea. It was ""Super-power children"" vs. ""Monsters who look very frightening but in fact have the same weaknesses like normal people you see on the streets - they die easily""."
" Tim Burton's visual methodology strives enough to make up for the tainted script
",0.0,0.9911,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"If you are fan of visionary director Tim Burton, chances are you know mostly for his distinct visual style, a style he's possessed since his signature debut in the comedy-horror 'Beetlejuice' in 1988. Burton has embraced a Gothic visual modus and macabre atmosphere that has most often made his films more of visual spectacles than films with compelling storytelling. This dark fantasy inspired by Ransom Riggs's best-selling novel series of the same name sees Burton continuing his signature trend with his dazzling visual methodology that manages to outplay it's occasionally clunky script. Written by Jane Goldman, frequent collaborator of director Matthew Vaughn, this film translates it's compelling source material with fine, but occasionally sluggish style-over-substance flick that only succeeds on embracing Burton's typical visual grandeur than coherent storytelling. Enter sixteen-year old Jake (played by Asa Butterfield), a young teen inspired by the extraordinary adventures of his grandfather Abe Portman (played by Terence Stamp) to seek out a mysterious foster family raised by the witch-like Miss Peregrine (played by Eva Green). The family consisted of children gifted with utterly bizarre abilities including a child who can manipulate air and breath underwater, another with an invisible body, one with a monstrous mouth at the back of her head, another with the ability to light things on fire with her bare hands, the list goes in. As the young man is drawn into their unnatural world, he learns the secrets of their family that put their lives in grave danger against mysterious monsters that pray on them.With Tim Burton operating behind the camera, it is predictable that this strives for bizarre and spooky imagery that immediately hits you with reminiscence of Burton's previous works. The world of the titular character's mysterious habitat is drawn with an authentic 1940s-era production design and spooky imagery of characters with creepy CGI anatomical abnormalities and corpses with eyes hollowed out; just enough bizarre scenery to give elementary-school aged kids to the heebie jeebies. The make-up done on Eva Green's Miss Peregrine to give her a Maleficient-like appearance is pretty nice to look at as well. How Tim Burton's visual heft manages to tower over the storytelling however, comes as the film's prime disappointment. The first hour follows a 'X-Men meets Harry Potter' plot introducing a series of uncanny characters through long, convoluted exposition. In the process, the characters then introduce a time looping element that is should have made the plot more interesting but only adds more needless confusion to the already mind-boggling plot, and it's not until the roughly the hour and a half mark when the story begins to make reasonable sense. At that point, we are granted with our heroes engaging climatic showdown against creepy Slenderman-like creatures followed by a fight against devilish, glowy-eyed Samuel L. Jackson (an odd casting choice) filled with slick special effects and CGI. By the end, it fairly makes up for the sluggish narrative as does the performances. Asa Butterfield does a fine job as the protagonist but it's only disappointing that his character falls short of interest. In the midst of the crowded cast however, Eva Green is easily the standout in the performance department, giving a profound portrayal as the titular supporting entity.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a slick dark fantasy spectacle that is gracefully held up by Tim Burton's signature visual appeal above Jane Goldman's blemished screenplay. In fair words, Tim Burton's effort on rendering Ransom Riggs's popular source material come to somewhat satisfying results, even if it falls deep under the flairs of Burton's magnums opuses."
" Very Confusing Movie ""Inspired by"" the Book Series.
",0.3117,0.9864,2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"Honestly, I do not know what they were thinking. If I hadn't read the book, I might have tolerated this movie, maybe gave it a 7/10 even. But the fact is, I read the books. I read a series that could have made a very interesting franchise and was expecting to watch the story of the books I read. During the first 45 minutes or so, the movie stuck to the original story and only mixed up characters for no apparent reason what so ever. They kept the name ""Emma"" for Jake's love interest but completely mixed up her character with Olive, which I do not understand. How is this justified? Why do that at all? I understand changing the story so it becomes one movie instead of a franchise but why mix up the characters? Then for the second half of the movie, they diverted tremendously from the original story it became a whole new unrelated story, and rather silly in my opinion. and This is the bigger problem with this movie, it started with high potential and good directing choices, then at the end, things became absurd and childish! The silly ""humor"" people bumping their heads and such, WTH is up with that? why not keep the dark atmosphere and ""seriousness"" of the movie instead of turning it into a silly cartoonish like series of events? I would have been very happy if they stuck to the original story, I would have been satisfied if they changed the story but kept the characters straight, I would have tolerated the movie if it was directed well, but honestly instead I was very disappointed. BTW, I'm not sure who the intended audience is supposed to be? It is certainly too graphic for children, and too silly for adults so who is it for then? The should have picked a different title and said it was inspired from the book, made it either a serious movie all the way and intended for adults or a silly action movie intended for children. What a shame Tom Burton."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9958,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"First off I have to come clean with the fact that I usually love Tim Burton's movies. I like the art, adventures and believe they bring something unique and fantastical to the otherwise bland Hollywood scene when it comes to fables directed to audiences above 10 years old.I expected a flop because of the low score, but Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children doesn't disappoint one bit. Because of this I find it meaningful to include the most prevalent critiques mentioned from reviews as I give you my own 2 cents. The criticism I've read thus far point toward 1.Sloppy/confusing second half 2.Bad acting and 3.Shallow character building/different from the original book.The story is complex and engaging from beginning til the end, revealing only a little bit time to time as it goes on. The mystique thus continues throughout the movie and gives the viewer a better chance to identify with the main character Jake (Asa Butterfield) as he unravels the secrets. The story is really interesting, the characters in it are fascinating and even the romance is working and enhances the plot. It is obvious in ways that should be obvious and complex in ways that should be complex. There are subtleties and meaning in the relationships and they are well thought through (for being a movie of it's kind). Sure the movie picks up and gets more action oriented towards the later half, but I feel it is well timed and well executed.As for criticism regarding the acting I just totally disagree. While Asa Butterfield doesn't shine as the main character, Eva Green, Samuel L. Jackson and Ella Purnell all do. Eva's interpretation of the caring and controlling Miss Peregrine is spot on. Her facial expressions themselves tell everything about the character. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect for the role, and Ella creates the needed link between the peculiar world and the normal. I'm otherwise easily put off by bad acting.Tim Burton makes his followers proud with this one. He sparks our imagination and gives us another reason to continue watching kids movies. I'm so grateful to directors like him and we need them when so much of the storytelling these days are pre-written with an algorithm to draw the most people in."
" Harry Potter and the methods of irrationality
",-0.4019,0.962,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie was not completely bad, in fact it started OK. Somewhere near the middle, somehow it changed into a comedy for children, with over talkative bad guys and quirky battles. It didn't even make sense near the end.I can only imagine Tim Burton had an idea that was dark and filled with horror, but also hope and pride in the main characters, while the studios imagined something like the Three Stooges with puppets and this is the result. There is no other explanation for the incongruity of the script and plot.Eva Green was actually brilliant in her role, the rest quite average. The special effects were average as well, despite their ambitious scale.Bottom line: a desperate clone of the Harry Potter movies, with clear issues in story telling. Tim Burton must regret his decision to accept to direct this."
" Love Tim Burton's Imagination
",0.6369,0.984,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"As always, Tim Burton love to create twisted worlds. I love to see his kind of romantic movies. The ones that are not just sweet romance, but you can feel it in his twisted world.In this movie, he shows the classic world of 1943 where the world is suffered by the war. The term of monsters hunting innocent people in our world is re-interpret to the hollows and Peculiar children. They need to find the safe place and make the loop so they can live there happily forever. Somehow, I feel it really connected to struggle of peace by that time. Tim Burton really gave us another good movie =)The 2 scores out of 10 have to be deducted. The reason is the complication of the loop and the time. In my opinion, I think there are lot of conflict in this movie, specially (spoiler alert), how his grandpa is still alive. I really don't understand that part. However, it's one of the movies I love to watch again. =) Keep creating this kind of movies, Tim. I'm your fan."
