" LOSES ALL THE GREAT PARTS ABOUT THE ORIGANAL!
",0.4753,-0.5848,2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,Do not watch. This is horrible. Another one of Disney's new cash grab reboots! If must watch Peter dragon watch the one from 1977.
" The kid was so annoying
",-0.541,0.5511,2021-03-25 00:00:00,1,I turned off five mins after the movie. The original Pete from the 1977 movie wasn't annoying and he can actually act .
" Honest opinion
",0.5106,-0.8163,2021-03-19 00:00:00,3,"If I had the choice i would rather go for the original than this show
The original was 100x better than this show
It was bright breezy, full of fun, thenacting was very laid back and the music and songs are still my.favorites
I hounded the shops to get this version and after watching it regretted it
It's now part.of.my for sale.videos as I dont like this version at all it's dark, gloomy and dull
Admittedly.it did bring A ""Tear"" to.my.eyes at the end but that was dust in my eye
I usually.cry in movies and advertisements bit this show yielded not even a mm of tears in a.spoon
As a matter of comparison on the grade of the film look at the first two films in the Harry Potter series compared to the remaining films.in the series
Even there I still preferred the first two to the remaining.6.shows

",0.0,0.9862,2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"A wonderfully divine version of the n77 version ... The dragon as cute and beautiful, as another, however more fuzzy, I already want a dragon friend ... It completely escapes the original, but it is so cute that we reveal it, to watch with the children, or tasting alone if you're a fan of the style like me...
Robert Redford example of how to grow old with talent, health and beauty ... And the talent of little Oakes Fegley... Fluffy and furry..."
" Heartwarming- 100%
",0.4767,0.998,2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this calm, heartwarming, moving film 3 times already.
The acting is natural, but Pete and Elliot are amazing. I kept hugging my pet cat the whole time, which I later discovered Elliot is based on a cat which made perfect sense.
For a calm kids movie the dragon scenes are amongst the best out there, realistic and romantically filmed with the most perfect , gorgeous, heart wrenching score with an awesome theme tune complete with choir.
The only movie I can compare it too is E.T which is a great honour in my opinion.
A complete departure from the cartoon (which I also love), and so underrated, I'd say it's one of the best Disney live action adaptations, but they didn't shout about it , not like the hugely disappointing Beauty and the Beast.
I can't wait to see the Directors take on Peter Pan.
It's c
Safe to say...I LOVE THIS MOVIE. thank you xx"
" A beautiful children's film suitable for all ages.
",0.5994,-0.0129,2020-12-11 00:00:00,10,I lovedthis film.A beautiful story about an orphaned boy raised by a dragon.Important story as well about the greed people see in exploiting nature for greed.I am an adult and it made me secretly wish there was a fluffy green dragon in our woods nearby.Some parts might be a bit scary for the very little viewers but overall this film is suitable for all ages.
" Touching
",0.0,0.984,2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,"Wholesome viewing.'Pete's Dragon' is a pleasant film. This remake brings a lot of feels thanks to its hearty narrative. The special effects are nice, as is the score - particularly towards the end. The cast isn't all-star but they all do good jobs.Oakes Fegley gives a sweet performance as Pete, though it's Bryce Dallas Howard who is probably the film's standout. I also enjoyed Robert Redford's role (Meacham) in this, though it would've been nice to have seen him utilised more - the same could be said for all bar Pete, in truth.There are some neat scenes in this, even if it is a film that does feel like it takes different elements from different films in parts - e.g. 'The Jungle Book' and 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'. A few of the characters aren't written to perfection, but not to the degree of it becoming an irritation.Touching. Worth a watch, for sure."
" Oakes Fegley
",0.0,0.8631,2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,"By far the best of the new Disney live action remakes. Its not a shot for shot rehash, and its got a genuine voice behind it trying to say something. Its the only one that doesn't feel like a shameless cash grab. David Lowery made a genuine film with as much heart and style as the rest of his ever improving filmography. The more i watch this film the more i love it. Its just so wholesomeness"

" Moving fantasy drama
",0.0,0.989,2020-06-30 00:00:00,9,"Pete's Dragon has elements of both The Jungle Book and King Kong. OK, now I'll have to press the spoiler button. This is a great show for kids over 10 (there are some guns and pretty serious drama). The dragon is a fantastic creation. The story is just believable (for a fantasy), which is perfect. The actors are supreme. Even Robert Redford is in it, being charming as ever. It's a very moving show, full of interest, with a very satisfying conclusion. I enjoyed it a lot, and I'm way past 10!"
" Cute dragon story
",0.4588,0.8925,2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,"This is a cute story about a really nice dragon and a boy.The film's plot is very simple and straight-forward.The boy protagonist had an extremely weak acting performance. He shouldn't have been cast for this role. His performance cost this movie at least 3 stars. The girl protagonist was also weak.The adult female supporting actress Bryce Dallas Howard and the villain Karl Urban had strong acting performances. Everyone else was ""meh.""If the dragon had not been designed and animated so darn adorable I would have given this movie a much lower score, maybe a 4.Conclusion: really darn adorable dragon. The kids had a very weak performance. The story is very predictable and straight-forward. Had a happy and satisfying ending though. However, the movie cannot get more than 7 because of the poor acting from the kid protagonist and the overly simplified and predictable story.7/10"
" Not enough happiness.
",-0.4449,0.9667,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,I love Pete and Elliot! I love Bryce Dallas Howard. This movie just lacks the cheerfulness that I would expect from a children's movie. So much of the story is chaos and running away and being chased and bad things happening.There aren't enough happy joyful fun feel good scenes in this movie for me.The music score is one of my favorite things about the movie. I absolutely love the music!!I love the flying sequences! I really love any scene with Elliot. He's like a big fluffy green dog Loveable that can fly.It took me three nights to get through this movie and I kept pausing it because I kept getting bored and looking at my phone.The movies overall color scheme was very muted which made it feel more depressing than it was.
" Pay attention to the darn road!
",-0.1759,0.9792,2020-04-03 00:00:00,2,"So the most annoying thing that keeps happening in this film are the adults looking back in the backseat whilst driving... OMG stop! I found this movie next to unwatchable. The dragon was just a big green CGI dog with wings. The little boy (Pete) did a great job with his acting, but everyone else seemed like pretty good actors reading Nickelodeon style of scripts. I had so many questions about this film while it rolled, the CGI and music was not enough for me to call this a good movie. Be prepared for adult actors to speak in soft little kid voices for a while. Also a great choice in having the soft caring boyfriend Dad figure, the same actor who was cast as Satan's son in Ghost Rider."
" A wonderful remake.
",0.5719,0.9922,2020-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I really liked the original when it came out but I was a small boy and it was of it's time, this wonderful remake does a beautiful job. Yes it's predictable and in many ways it's been done before but it doesn't have to be original to be enjoyable, the effects are great, some lovely acting and my favorite thing, the soundtrack, it's magical.
I'm not writing a review about the cinematography or the script, casting or anything other than my opinion, it made me feel young at heart."
" Not 'The Jungle Book' or 'Tarzan', but enjoyable enough...I guess...
",0.5927,0.9733,2019-12-16 00:00:00,5,"Ok, so this was a rather fun-filled fantasy adventure drama with good visuals. The film is well made and the acting not too shabby.I have a few issues with the film, though. Pete was five years old when he ended up in the woods. When he is found, he seemingly doesn't know what a balloon is. Surely his parents would have thrown him parties - with balloons - as parents do. He remembers the word 'adventure' he learnt minutes before the accident, yet he doesn't know what bread or a toothbrush is????!! At the age of five he must have had bread and should remember what it is and - most importantly - how to eat it! Parents teach kids from a very young age to brush their teeth, so how can he not recall a toothbrush??? This makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and he doesn't even know what a phone is.... Umf, I rest my case...Otherwise, the film was ok. This is definitely more for kids, though. I must admit, the final act was really good, filled with action and suspense and really good visuals."

This film is more in vein with beautiful dramas like, The Water Horse, Hachiko, A Dog's Purpose and many more like minded movies with a humane message.
Pete's Dragon has a heart, it's one of those slow films that draw you in with a purposeful plot & great script; and it doesn't hurt that the cgi is beautifully done too, to make the magic more believable.
Overall a beautiful film, that can be watched over & over again."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9576,2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,I Really like this movie the acting is fantastic the story is captivating and the soundtrack is absolutely magical and folksy. the story of Pete and Elliot is a very beautiful one and the movie has many surprisingly deep emotional scenes. Bryce Dallas Howard shows off her incredible acting skills in this film with a very believable and captivating performance. the kids where fantastic in there parts and have a very bright future ahead of them. the movie gets a bit boring when it hits the halfway mark and it takes some time for it to speed up again but overall a very great movie from Disney and worth a watch or two.
" Nice family movie
",0.4215,0.4404,2019-06-28 00:00:00,5,Entertaining fantasy family movie to pass the time if you don't mind the Tarzan/Jungle Book cliche plot.
" This family movie is ok, but too emotional.
",0.3612,0.8401,2019-05-02 00:00:00,4,"I love the part when Pete (a boy who lives in the woods) and Elliot (a friendly dragon who turns himself invisible) play together and having fun. However, I hate the part when there are more human involvement (which includes a group of lumberjacks) near Pete's home. People including Grace (a forest ranger) and the little girl, Natalie, were following Pete because they think he ran away and got lost from his parents, but it's not true. Elliot is the true guardian who can look after Pete. If he stayed with Elliot, he wouldn't have been captured by humans. This movie should've been better if there's less humans, more animals, and a peaceful family-friendly adventure/exploring."
" Pete's Dragon is... Drab and Melancholy.
",-0.4404,0.7836,2019-03-01 00:00:00,2,"After practically falling in love with 1977's 'Pete's Dragon,' there's certain things we've come to expect from this magical story: humor, songs, likable characters, and of course, whimsy. Although the idea of a 'Pete's Dragon' with a bit more action and ""epic dragon stuff"" is fine, we still need that Disney fun to make it all come together. Evidently, David Lowery, (who both directed and wrote the remake) forgot this all together.For starters, the original was set in the 1900's, providing a colorful background for the story, while the remake is set in an early 1980's town, and not a very fun one at that. Pete seems to dwell in the forest for no apparent reason. The original Pete lived in the woods because he was hiding from the Gogans; he wasn't a Mowgli-style wild boy incapable of speech! The opening scene is very traumatic and very unnecessary. And the CGI Elliot is nothing special. He is furry, which is very strange. Last I checked, dragons were reptiles, not cats.Bryce Dallas Howard is extremely off putting as Grace, the new Nora. She doesn't sing, she doesn't dance; in fact, she's a hard core forest ranger (how charming). Instead of having a funny, bumbling father like Mickey Rooney, she has a creepy, clinically depressed father played by Robert Redford, who would be more lovable if he wasn't in the movie at all. Then there's Oakes Fegley as Pete, who can be mistaken for a girl sometimes. The villain of our story is a lumberjack, Gavin (Karl Urban), who sets out to catch Elliot and prove his existence (how dare he want to make eye opening scientific advancements!).Among the film's other issues is comedy found where it doesn't belong. Isn't people toppling off gurneys hilarious?!? No? You're right. If you saw a dragon outside a hospital window when you were 10, you would smile, right? No? Correct again.To summarize, this dreary revision of 'Pete's Dragon' will probably induce nothing but blinks and snores."
" Yet another underwhelming live action
",0.0,0.9692,2019-02-28 00:00:00,5,"To be honest I have to admit I'm a really big Pete's Dragon fan, the original, definitely not this one. My nephew and I saw the original many times over his childhood in many different venues. I also own it, of course.Disney's latest plan to take money from us is the live action remakes of all their classics. I liked the Dalmatian movies. I loved Maleficent (different story, at least a different point of view). Was very disappointed in Jungle Book, Cinderella. Not going to spend money on any of these any more. I also refuse to go to movies whose characters are changed to add a ""modern"" characteristic (like sexuality) to ""spice things up"".Pete's Dragon (2016) tried too hard to be a big movie with a big story and big visuals. If you're going to do a movie about a potential monster who cares for a child but adults want to attack, then you have to put the special love between the child and the dragon as priority way at the beginning of the movie so that we'll love him to and our hearts will ache as he's put into danger. Otherwise you've got nothing and this movie had nothing. They should stop spending money just to spend it until they have a real story worth doing. If you want to make a new movie with new story then do that, don't ruin the classics."
" Likable but slight
",0.0,0.9538,2019-01-16 00:00:00,7,"There is a moment, early on, with a strange shot of a car in motion followed by a rather melancholy tableau, that I thought Pete's Dragon was going to be something different from standard Disney fair. That the company was taking a chance on something with a touch of experimentation.I was wrong.After that, this is a very standard family film about a boy and his dog-like dragon. There's laughs, there's some action, there's good special effects, there's some slightly touching moments, there's an unlikely ending.But there's not really much to it. It's predictable from beginning to end, it takes no chances, it breaks no new ground, and it's not even that strong an example of something trodding the same old ground well.It's not so much a kid's movie that I would say only kids should watch it, but I'd say it definitely skews to the kid's movie genre more strongly than some other Disney films.It's fine, probably good for kids, but nothing special."
" A Magical Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9979,2018-11-01 00:00:00,10,"""Pete's Dragon"" had me glued to the screen from beginning to end and was in a word, flawless. While I have read many reviews calling it ""appalling"" and ""a waste of time,"" I found it rather beautiful.The story line, while cheesy and cliche, took me on an adventure through friendship, love and heartache. As an adult, I cried from beginning to end and took a journey back into my childhood, reconnecting with my long-forgotten imagination and I found myself believing in magic again.The cinematography was brilliantly done. The camera angles and movements added a new element to the adventure and depicted the emotional element really well. The music was also expertly chosen as it awakened your emotions and added to the magical connection between Pete and his dragon, Elliot.The choice of acting talent was also brilliantly done. Little Oakes Fegley was brilliant in his role as Pete and is definitely one to look out for in future films. His portrayal of a 'feral"" child was flawless and his endearing spirit could be felt throughout the film.Another acting talent worth mentioning is Bryce Dallas Howard who played Grace, the forest ranger. She is one of the few actresses who portrays her characters with grace and poise and seems to treat them with the respect they deserve. Her portrayal of Grace was flawless and she epitomized her character's love for the forest and empathy for Pete's situation beautifully.The CGI animation was beautifully done, in my opinion and I imagine that a lot of love and effort went into creating such a stunning creature. Elliot, the dragon, was both relatable and magical. For that, I would like to thank Disney for bringing him to life and for treating him with the respect he deserves.I would however advise parents to watch the movie before allowing their children to watch it as some scenes may be disturbing for them. Consequently, I would recommend that children younger than 8 years old not be allowed to watch the film as they cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality yet and may be traumatised as a result.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and highly recommend it to anyone who would like to escape from the world for a while."

",0.431,0.9797,2018-10-07 00:00:00,5,I expected more from this movie to be a little close to what the original was but I was a little disappointed in the this remake. The plot and storyline seemed bland but the overall acting was still very good. The kid who played Pete was very convincing as the character of Pete and he did a very good job but it just lacked excitement and enthusiasm to keep you watching the movie and I gotta give Robert Redford respect where it is due.
" Tarzan boy with his green Clifford (that has wings).
",0.0,-0.1655,2018-10-01 00:00:00,1,The original Disney film set high standards that were not met. The wacky characters songs and other enjoying pleasantures by the first film were lost in the direction of the remake. This film should be ashamed of the giant green dog with wings that resembles nothing of Elliot. The basic plot line is Elliot coming to help Pete get out of an abusive home and into a good one this had him raised as a second Tarzan sent into civilization. This film didn't work towards the recreation of the original songs but yet played one knock off repeatidly. This movie should feel bad about itself for the let down it was.
" Brilliant movie
",0.5859,0.8651,2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,Having never seen Pete's Dragon before I loved this movie and thought the amount of emotion to bring a lot of love towards the dragon was done really well. I also thought that having the tension and the anger towards the hunters looking for Elliot was also really well done and caused me to not be able to pull away from the screen. Highly recommend this movie.
" YOU CAN ONLY GO UP, OH WELL...!
",0.0,0.8043,2018-07-30 00:00:00,1,"One of my earliest movie memories was seeing Pete's Dragon on the big screen (my second big film in a theater, Jaws being the first) at Radio City Music Hall no less w/the Rockettes. It'd probably make for the mother of all screenings but that wasn't the case. Even at the age of eight, I knew Pete's Dragon was just a'ight. So fast forward more than 35 years & now a film w/same title comes out & I feel strangely unresponsive. They can only go up w/a new adaptation so why am I not more excited than I should be. After watching it, I can see why this film didn't leave a mark the way you'd think the mouse house would. Disney is raiding their animated back catalogue & keep coming up aces w/their live action remakes (I can't wait for the Song of the South remake...Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Remus, anyone?). So by telling a tale that is both whimsical & a critique of non-environmentalism, what are we left with but an earnest yarn that goes nowhere. Not even the new tunes improve things much. At this point, I would think so far out of the box that the result would definitely raise an eyebrow. Give Terence Malick a tenth of this remake's budget & let him go to town...I'm there."
" Great family film

" Not as good as the original.
",-0.0274,0.9432,2018-07-04 00:00:00,8,"My sister and me saw a TV aired version of the original and we saw it so many times that I only mildly liked this version. The 2 movies are very different from each other as well. In fact, the part I liked best was Robert Redford taking Mickey Rooney's original role. So, in short, this is good but the original is way better."
" A story about loneliness that teaches you how to treat animals
",-0.0258,-0.9062,2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"A story about a lost orphaned boy who befriends a magical dragon. But really it's a story about loneliness. The rest of civilisation, who find the boy six years later, think the boy is lonely, missing his family, but he's made a family with the dragon, whom he calls Elliot. But Elliot needs Pete just as much as Pete needs Elliot, both were orphaned and lonely, and need each other to survive. But the dragon was the loneliest of all the characters because it had never met another of its species.Unfortunately some thought the dragon was a monster, that needed to tamed, captured and exploited, when in reality the dragon was a rare endangered species that needed protecting and preserving, and to with its own kind.A wonderful children's story and definitely worth watching as a film."
" This took a different route from the original but it was still good
",0.6705,0.9931,2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed the original and used to watch it many times. But this was a nice little update with several changes. We get the orphan boy, his sympathetic and loving dragon friend, and a community of concerned and fearful humans. It was not at all predictable and offered the same story with a different style. I rented this and enjoyed it, though it's not my absolute-favorite remake. Cinderella (2015) and The Jungle Book (2016) are tied for my favorite Disney remake. And let's hope that The Lion King in 2019 will do more justice. But back to Pete's Dragon. This was a nice update with a more modern setting. And the ending I did not see coming. Much different than the original. I don't remember the new film's ending too well, but you'll have to see it in order to believe it. I'll leave it at that."
" A very worthy remake which surpasses the original
",0.6697,0.9972,2018-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Way back in 1977 Disney made a film called Pete's Dragon in which an orphan boy was helped by his invisible pet dragon Elliot (yes, really) to find a place in the world where he belonged. It was cheery, bright and colourful, laced with songs, and featured a cartoon dragon. Now, nearly 40 years later, Disney brings us another film called Pete's Dragon in which an orphan boy is helped by his invisible pet dragon Elliot to find a place in the world where he belongs. It is often downbeat, dark and dim, has no integral songs, and features a CGI dragon called Elliot. And it is wonderful.5-year old Pete survives a car crash in remote woods in which his parents are killed. He survives thanks to Elliot, with whom he bonds. 6 years later he encounters humans again in the person of forest ranger Grace. Pete's re-integration into the human race (against his will) begins: this, and the encroachment of deforestation, prejudice Elliot's secretive existence.We know that this is going to be a very different Pete's Dragon right from the car crash at the start, stranding the helpless freshly orphaned child in the woods. Bright and reassuring, this most definitely is NOT. When we next see Pete he is almost feral, in a performance of extraordinary animal agility by Oakes Fegley. I'm not sure that this is the sort of film which gets Oscar nods other than for effects, but this lad, as well as physicality, gives a touching and believable performance of a child with divided loyalties caught between two worlds.The other actors are also good (Karl Urban has the thankless job of playing the eco-vandal and would-be dragon captor, and does the best he can with a role which is written in cliché). And Elliot is wonderfully realised. The 1977 version was clearly the initial visual inspiration, but the design is clever, coupling cuddly furriness (think Sully in Monsters Inc) with credible dangerousness, in an expressive and emotional whole. The fact that Elliot himself is, effectively, an orphan adds a dimension missing from the original. Plus the animation is amazing, giving a genuine sense of bulk, weight and momentum to this huge critter.The story works, and the morality aspects are included subtly and sensitively: you are not clubbed over the head with them.Plus the movie contains the single best Hero Moment I've seen this year - it took my breath away (and, no, I don't mean the subsequent rising from the mist one). And - be warned - there may be tears.My only major reservation concerns the 3D. It adds nothing of significance, and when will film companies understand that a 3D release print needs to be lighter to compensate for the darkness of the polarising glasses?As with The Jungle Book, this is the best kind of remake: it adds to the original while retaining the heart of what made the original a success."
" A worthy live action remake
",0.4404,0.9705,2018-04-30 00:00:00,8,"A fun family feature bursting with Disney charm. Robert Redford and Jessica Chastain gave solid performances, and the CGI used to bring Elliot to life is some of the best I've seen to date.

But I upvoted some negative reviews here, because they have a point. Dragon's theme isn't disclosed. Almost no action for 100 minutes. Emotions is a good thing, but you can't build the whole movie on heart touching moments.
The last thing that cost that film a star for me: who the hell will choose people when you could spend your entire life with a dragon?"

But the dragon was actually more believable than (a) much of the acting*, (b) characters' reactions to said dragon, (c) the boy himself. It was still cute and endearing enough, I suppose. But I think this film wanted to be magical...which is why Redford used that word like 5 times. It was not magical. It was cute. Big difference.* I'm looking at you, Karl Urban."

The pretentious Hollywood writers (who must be to young to know we didn't wear seat belts in 1983, or that if air breaks lose pressure they actually set) should've changed Pete and Elliott's name and called this movie something else. The original, that had to use a drawn in dragon, stomped all over this movie. What a disappointment."

Its got some very good characters, the CGI was done just as well as Jungle Book 2016. There is not much songs compared to the old version which is a little sad, however its got a very emotional and fun side to it all. I recommend buying this and watching. It really is a good film and its plot it good. There are also some funny scenes which even made me laugh. The plot was also very good."
" By far the best and loveliest of Disney's recent crop of remakes
",0.6369,0.9926,2017-11-15 00:00:00,7,"As Disney wade through their back catalogue of animated classics to introduce to modern audiences, the wealth of pure quality at their disposal borders on the embarrassing. By the end of 2016, favourites such as Maleficent (a spin on Sleeping Beauty), Cinderella and The Jungle Book had already been and gone, to varying degrees of success. Next on the agenda, much to many people's surprise, was Pete's Dragon, a live-action remake of a pretty crappy mixture of animation and live-action from 1977, a film many won't have even heard of, and the few who have actually seen it will have long forgotten. The choice for the director's chair was also curious: The job fell to indie director David Lowery, who up to this point was known only for his little- seen outlaw movie Ain't Them Bodies Saints. It seemed as though Disney were taking a ""may as well get it over with"" attitude towards re- imagining one of their more obscure works, but 2016's Pete's Dragon is actually the best and loveliest of their recent crop.It's the 70's, a five year-old Pete is heading on a road trip with his parents in search of adventure. The plan is turned on its head (much like their vehicle) when a deer runs out into the road, causing them to crash and killing Pete's parents in the process. Within moments of fleeing the wreckage and making it in the woods, Pete finds himself confronted by a giant dragon. Five years later, and Pete (now played by Oakes Fegley) has forged a bond with the dragon, who he names Elliot, and has turned feral in the forest. Their home is shrinking every day, thanks to a lumberjack crew ran by Jack (Wes Bentley) and his brother Gavin (Karl Urban), so it isn't long until their discovered. Luckily for them, Pete is seen by good-hearted park ranger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), whose father (played by Robert Redford), tells stories of the day he encountered a huge green dragon in his youth. As Pete longs to go home while also warming to his new surrogate family, Elliot misses his friend, and finds himself hunted by prize-seeker Gavin. This is a tried-and-tested Disney formula, so expect few surprises here. What is most surprising, and utterly charming, is the way Lowery goes about his business. There is plenty of genuine heart and care taken with developing its characters. Even the 'villain' of the piece shows genuine concern for Pete's well-being when he is discovered ragged and howling, and Jack isn't the cold habitat- slayer you would expect. Although there is an impressive CGI dragon complete with tail-chasing and a cute wet nose, the story stays remarkably low- key, comparable in many ways to Steven Spielberg's E.T. before the government goons enter the story. If there's a major criticism to be, it is that Gavin's sudden ambition to slay the dragon comes out of nowhere, and seems included simply to create a foe for Elliot while Pete is off in society. For a film that handles the human drama so well, it simply isn't needed, although it sets up a climax exciting enough to slightly make up for it. If you haven't seen the original, then save yourself the trouble, as 2016's Pete's Dragon is a rare example of a remake that leaves the original well in its wake."
" Is Elliot imaginary?

He lives for 6 years in the northern forests around Mill Haven wearing a jungle lion cloth and no shoes. Ever step on a pine cone while running barefoot? He is spotted by Natalie (Oona Laurence) and is semi-forced to live with her family, who are lovers of the forest. Then there are the ""evil"" loggers, King Kong gets captured, escapes, falls from the Empire State Building, and if he had wings, the story would of had a different ending.In spite of a few small downer spots, actually minimized by Disney, the film was upbeat and fun for the whole family. Certainly light years better than BFG, but as an adult, I prefer ""The Secret Life of Pets"" not saying this was bad, just nor as sophisticated in its humor.Kids film with no fart or urination humor. It is very formula. Filmed in New Zealand for the old forest effect."
" Filmed in beautiful New Zealand
",0.5994,0.8998,2017-09-25 00:00:00,6,"While the opening scene of Pete's Dragon might seem a little kid-unfriendly, you can rest assured that nothing bad is going to happen to the title character. A little boy is seen in a car with his parents, driving down a deserted road in a forest. In a terrible car accident, the boy's parents are killed, and the boy is rescued by a dragon.Six years later, the boy is still living in the forest with his dragon, happy and healthy. But, as always happens in movies, when someone leaves their cozy surroundings and enter the real world, trouble ensues. Oakes Fegley plays Pete, and he gives a terribly heartbreaking performance. I always marvel at little children who can act in front of the camera.While the majority of people who are going to want to see this movie are those who grew up with and enjoyed the 1972 original, I watched it for Robert Redford. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a forest ranger, and Redford plays her father. Most of the grown-ups in the movie don't believe the boy when he claims to have been raised by a dragon, but Robert Redford does. Of course he does; he's Robert Redford! There are some exciting moments, some moments that probably are a little upsetting for kids, and some beautiful surroundings—it was filmed in New Zealand. But, all in all, it's not my favorite kiddy movie, and it's not one I'll probably want to rent again."
" Rating: B-
",0.0,0.9949,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"I liked this movie, but not as much as I wanted to...Elliot is a CGI beauty, no doubt about it. The green dragon is perfectly incorporated in the film and it doesn't feel like Oakes Fegley is acting in front of a green screen instead. It's hard not to be convinced by it and that helps when at the end, they give us all the usual dramatic showdown because I genuinely cared about Elliot.And that's the main problem with this adaptation: there's so little Elliot. I mean, the movie's called Pete's Dragon, so one instantly assumes that this is a story about Pete and his dragon. The truth isn't quite that, since there are a lot of supporting characters that act like they're the protagonists. Jack (Wes Bentley) doesn't have a single bonding scene with Pete, Karl Urban as Gavin is intended to be the unnecessary ""villain"", Natalie (Oona Laurence) has a lot of screen time as well as Grace, and Meacham (Robert Redford) is just the old man who once saw a dragon ...  A whole bunch of scenes is spent with these and more characters, which proves that the film really struggles to find someone for the audience to identify themselves with.Even the kid is not as compelling and captivating as he should be. Oakes Fegley is fine, but he should have been a lot better (he doesn't get close to Mowgli, in The Jungle Book, for example). There's a gap between the moment where Pete leaves the dragon for a while and from the moment where they get back together: that gap takes forever to close and it definitely brings the movie down.It might feel like I disliked this movie, but don't be mistaken. This IS a GOOD movie, but it could've been great. Elliot is a wonderful CGI creation, the film is beautiful to look at, Pete and Grace's family scenes are really heartfelt and it does bring you the ""feels"" by the end, if you know what I mean.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

",0.0,0.3859,2017-07-28 00:00:00,6,"With a heartbreaking intro, this movie begins strong both visually and thematically. There is some heart to a story of an orphan and his dragon but a lot of the 'plotty' things really get in the way. You can probably guess this isn't a story about how Pete lived in the woods with a dragon and no one bothered them, the end.There are some nice visuals here and there but I found the parts in the woods to look really drab and colour graded to an ugly green. Elliot the dragon looked pretty good and they managed more emotion in his face than Okja.The bad guy part of the story doesn't even try to give him motivations. He's just there because he wants to capture a dragon and act mad/scared all the time.Overall nothing awful here but also nothing to make it stand out as a compelling kid's movie."
" A Very Good Family movie and it's not a musical
",0.4927,0.9278,2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"A straightforward fantasy story with excellent CGI ""animation"". Nobody breaks into song although there are a few original songs. It's set in the 90's or when telephones were still hooked up to the wall and there was no cable. The local legend of the dragon is retold by the father of the tomboyish (female) forest ranger. Robert Redford and Bryce Dallas Howard play well off each other. Pete's family is on a nature drive through the forest and both his parents die in an auto accident after swerving to avoid hitting a deer. He wakes up, discovers the dragon, which he names, ""Elliott"" and he becomes a feral child of the woods, until discovered by others, 6 years later. He is raised and protected by the big green furry dragon who acts like a large dog, and he communicates with Pete by various guttural sounds and body language. According to the ""Roger Ebert"" reviewer, it's a cross between a live action ""Jungle Book"" and ""The Black Stallion"". Pete rides Elliott like a ""luck Dragon"" and flies into the sky. Elliott can breathes fire when angry and can become invisible. He perches on the chimney of the hospital when Pete is taken for examination. Good family interaction, as a young girl his age befriends him. All with a good case of the ""warm fuzzies"", to be sure. There has to be a greedy villain who wants to capture and exploit the beast, but, of course, Elliott gets away and Pete stays with Grace the forest ranger,and somehow Child Protective Services is kept at bay. Very cute, no real violence except for some loud gunfire and tranquilizer darts. Most enjoyable and the kind of thing that Walt did best, even though Disney Studios is only the film's distributor. in this case."
" Mission accomplished Disney.
",0.4404,0.9981,2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"""You know, when I was a little girlI wanted to live in the forest more than anything. I love being out there. It was so fun, with the squirrels and the birds and the trees So, when I grew up, I made it my job to protect the woods, and everything in them. Which I supposed includes you."" I've just written down my opinion about ""Beauty and the beast"" and I realized that I've been watching ""Pete's dragon"" a couple of times already, along with my 7 year old daughter, without telling anything about it. Some catching up to do I guess. Let me just pull a short and powerful piece of opinion out of the hat. As I mentioned before, I always appreciate a live-action rendition of a Disney cartoon. Now, the 1977 version was actually already a sort of a mixture of an ordinary movie and pieces of drawings (and late Mickey Rooney starring in it as well). The dragon in this newer version looks lifelike and fortunately it doesn't have that pink wig anymore, but it lights up like a green lantern whenever Pete touches it.There's only one way to keep my kids interested while watching a Disney movie. Try to suck them into the story instantly and immediately show them that specific item which was the initial cause for them to watch the movie anyway. So no long-lasting digressions at the beginning, please. And that's why my impatient daughter liked this Disney so much. It didn't take long for the dragon, who set himself the task to look after poor Pete (Oakes Fegley), to reveal himself. Before my daughter knew it, she was watching breathlessly how trees were smashed down and she saw this immense green dragon appear (a cuddly kind of dragon thanks to his soft looking fur). An additional positive element is the fact that the fatal accident isn't portrayed explicitly. As a result the curious question ""What happened to Pete's mom and dad?"" was asked lots of times. But this incident was forgotten quickly as soon as the adventurous pace was switched into a higher gear.The rest of the film isn't very original and contains the known theme with young people who still believe in fairy tales and are amazed by these fairy tale-like events without thinking of any financial gain. And of course they have to contend with adults whose intentions aren't so good when it's about these miracles. Indeed, money or fear are usually motives to capture the fantasy. In ""Pete's dragon"" it's Gavin (Karl Urban) who wants to make money out of Elliot, by using him as a sideshow attraction. Of course there are still adults who believe in legends and fairy tales like Meacham (Robert Redford). And then there are those who begin to believe in it after a while, like Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Jack (West Belley). And all this is supplemented with youthful enthusiasm, adventurous experiences and terribly exciting action. On child level, that is.Oh well, ultimately I've enjoyed myself with this simple youth movie. A moment of relaxation and a feeling of childish amazement. And at the same time enjoying the applied modern techniques and graphic magic. The moment Pete and Elliot were chasing each other and Elliott splashed into the flowing river, was a beautiful scene. And as an adult, I also appreciated the acting of Robert Redford, Bryce Dallas Howard and of course Oakes Fegley. But do you know what pleasured me the most? That moment my daughter looked at me with such smiling eyes, full of sparkles, and asked me convincingly if we would watch it again one time. Mission accomplished Disney!

" A beautiful adventure for the whole family
",0.7351,0.9931,2017-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Pete's Dragon is the pure and simple incarnation of the ""Disney movie"". With a light and beautiful adventure tone that touches the whole story, the film does not try to be revolutionary, nor be more than it is, it simply focuses on being a good story aimed at children and their families.The acting in the film is good, nothing incredible or extra- ordinary, but all the actors are well. Elliot's CGI is not realistic at all, but it's also not that much of a complaint, it's an OK CGI, it works within the story they're telling, and at no point does it make you lose your focus on the narrative.The soundtrack is wonderful, all the songs give a perfect mood for each scene, still having a very ""country"" feel to the small town where everything happens.In summary, Pete's Dragon may not make history, or be featured on lists of the best films of the last 10 years, but it's definitely a beautiful, incredibly fun adventure that will surely entertain the whole family that you set out to watch."
" It's a winner. Worthy in every respect.

The movie really dragged when he wasn't around.The remake solves this problem, largely because of how seriously it takes it dragon. Elliot is far mote than just (first-rate) CGI; he's a genuine character. Which is why it's heartbreaking to see him tranq'd and strapped to a flatbed, and thrilling when he takes to the sky.The cast is also taken seriously, what with its fair share of name actors. But the movie's heart lies in the relationship between Elliot and Pete (Oakes Fegley). That kid's amazing.Put it this way: I'm not Disney's biggest fan, but I love this dragon.8/10"

You can imagine my excitement and also my apprehension when I learned that this film was being filmed.This is a very enjoyable family film that has lovely moments of tenderness, wonderful special effects (the design of Elliot, flying scenes, etc.), it has fun and plenty of action, and Redford and Howard are good in their roles and seem to believe in magic because I thought they were the best thing in the film.However, the movie lack the most important thing to me -- magic. All the characters keep speaking about magic, but the actors playing them don't believe in magic, the film does not create magic, so it feels a lovely fantasy film not a magic children's film.

" Although Not A Masterpiece, It Is Still A Magical & Wonderful Gem.
",0.1043,0.9995,2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Ever have films that you know aren't beyond amazing but you love them anyway? Something happens to be hilarious or an old action movie happens to be a fun but you know it won't receive rave reviews. That is how I feel about the more serious remake of Pete's Dragon. Although it has received high reviews, its no ET or Its a Wonderful Life. There are flaws that this movie has, but none diminish the overall quality. In fact, most of the flaws work as both strengths and weaknesses. Regardless of what's good or bad, the movie really got to me.This remake of the 1977 musical animated/live-action comedy is completely different. In this case, different mean better. I'm a sucker for 2D animation mixed with live-action and that was the sole reason for me liking it the little bit that I did. This remake ditches almost all of that and goes for a Tarzan-meets-ET vibe. Pete and his family are on a road trip where a tragic car crash leads Pete to be the sole survivor in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Six years later, Pete (played by newcomer Oakes Fegley) has been able to survive in the woods with the aide of his best friend, a dragon he names Elliot. Elliot looks a little bit like traditional dragon, but he is presented more like a big green dog in this. That's because that's the essence of the story: a boy and his dog. A lonely boy has the most unlikely best friend. People have pointed out that Elliot is not in much of the film. The movie did not need to feature Elliot in most of the movie, it is about Pete's escapades made safe by his dragon.So Elliot has helped Pete survive in the woods for the past six years. When lumberjacks start to tear down parts of the woods, Pete is spotted by young Natalie (Oona Laurence) and her aunt Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is a forest ranger. They help Pete adjust to life outside of isolation while trying to make sense of his past. Grace's father (Robert Redford) had been telling legends of a local dragon, unsure if he saw a real one himself when he was younger. So Pete leads Grace and her family to Elliot where they try to help him escape to freedom.This is a beautiful and magical film that takes me back to being a kid. I'm sure some kids may find this boring, but I found myself totally enchanted throughout the whole movie. A few times, Pete's mother and Grace say to him ""You are the bravest boy I've ever known."" They way that all that goes down is enough to make me melt. The movie may be simplistic with not much layers in some of the characters of story, and the premise may have been done before, but all is executed so perfectly. That is how I think this flaw serves as a strength, it didn't need to be all complicated for the viewer to be enchanted. Want a complex film? Go see Double Indemnity. Pete's Dragon proves that a movie can be simplistic but still wondrous, if only done right.What keeps this film from being just eye-candy are the actors. They are all so charming and done to perfection. The stand out is Oakes Fegley as Pete. Rarely do I ever see a performance by a child done with such grace and at such a high degree. He barely has any lines, so his behaviour needed to be extra perfect. These days its pretty hard to be a silent actor, but Oakes is perfect. In a year of feral boys, this is the best performed. And his relationship with Eliot is so wonderful. One of the better friendships of recent times. Jacob Tremblay from Room was the most recent breakout child star with a promising future, now we have Oakes Fegley. I would love to see them do a movie together. Oona Laurence is also a great young actress. Bryce Dallas Howard, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, and Robert Redford are also fine.Is is a big deal that it doesn't achieve the highest honour? Of course not. This is an enchanting feel-good movie that everybody can enjoy.3.5/4"

Nothing is worse than your favorite movie or story being remade and done an injustice. This is not the case for Pete's Dragon. This take on the tale is both fresh and expertly executed. It has very few similarities of the original, save for the core story-line of a boy befriending a green dragon with masterful camouflaging abilities. Bryce Dallas Howard and Robert Redford match very well together as daughter and father, respectively, who take in young Pete after he's found in the wilderness appearing to live alone. Oakes Fegley, as Pete, does a spectacular job; his performance just melts your heart. The work done on Elliot was appropriately more realistic than the original's hand drawn rendition, but maintained the same warmth and playfulness. The decision to make Elliot furry rather than scaled, while different, worked for the character. Any fan of the original would appreciate this take on the story and it should be given a chance for nostalgia's sake and to enjoy something new."

And yes some may be surprised by the fact that the voice of the Crypt Keeper (Tales from the Crypt) is ""speaking"" the Dragon, but that would mean you are not familiar with the versatility of the guy behind the voice and also his body of work (no pun intended).But apart from the good effects and some good family story, you also have some heavyweights in front of the camera. Redford alone is amazing, but he gets support (literally) by everybody else. A story with highs and lows and while it is predictable, it is also exactly what family entertainment should be. Nothing more but certainly nothing less"

It's a real rush to think of a boy with a magical dragon who breathes fire (only when provoked) and who saves him initially from a wolf attack. When Pete and Elliot play in the forest in that long running scene...few cinematic moments have moved me so. But you can't watch this film for mistakes...it's riddled with them...you just have to sit back, pretend and enjoy. And OK I'm just gonna say it, because I'm old now too...Redford's appearance and acting in this movie is substandard. He gives nothing to the movie and convinces us he's better behind the camera than in front of it. We should make a pact to quit dragging these old guys before the camera when they just can't act anymore. Maybe there's a vehicle for him still...this wasn't it. Besides all the obvious errors, Pete would have grossly long fingernails, toenails and calluses on his feet. We see none of that. His attire....come on, a tattered leather thing and tight shorts underneath?? I can understand obscenity/privacy laws and not allowing the risk of showing his boy parts on screen, but why that bizarre combination? Where would those shorts have come from (the car wreckage)? And in the hospital, they have chosen some kinda padded diaper thingy to wear under his robe? Great boy actor though...even better with some more direction I suspect. How does he survive in the (mock) PNW in the winter? I would have liked to see more plausible survival items in the cave, for example. Elliot is actually a giant, green fuzzy Pit Bull type character that chases his tail on occasion. I can understand the kid appeal, so I won't criticize the dragon...he is incredibly endearing. Second best scene of the movie; when Pete rocks up on his toes, chest out and growls at the bear with all his boy might. Watch this movie with a little one!!!"

The film has a lot of good actors, some that I really respect. Yet I couldn't like the movie and the fact that Disney's money put Robert Redford and Karl Urban into such a boring thing became something to hate, rather than enjoy.Worst of all, I found the entire story so blatantly condescending. The kid that lives in the forest and needs to be saved by civilization, the friends that understand their relationship is doomed, yet blame no one for it and jump right into acceptance, the worst forest ranger ever who is married with the boss of the men who cut the trees, the pandering to the middle America audience with all the trucks and woodcutters and the country music, the lame CGI dragon that instead of magical and imposing behaved exactly like my little terrier dog, only dumber.Bottom line: a children's tale that teaches submission to society even when magic is involved, a story that doesn't make anyone feel anything, and a good cast that appears half bored and half disgusted with playing in this film."

I love Redford but not in this film. Slow, Un-entertaining and bland. I see where they are trying to go with the sentimental folksie vibe. Maybe if more of Mumford and Sons were on the track. Nah, it was not a good Re-Make at all. Junglebook.....remake.....AWESOME!!!"

I was so shocked to see a mini Daryl (Walking Dead-Norman Reedus)in Pete (Oakes Fegley) and thought he was wonderful will be watching more from him. I was surprised at how emotional I got as I watched this movie with my grand kids. I felt the story line was so much better instead of having bad adopted parents after him, they went for him being orphaned by a car accident. and loved the CgI Dragon so much better than the cartoon one in the original. I think everyone can enjoy both films either way."
" It was a truly heartwarming experience!
",0.7424,0.9945,2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This is my first IMDb review, I really liked this movie that's why I felt the urge to let the people know how amazing It is! Firstly I want to tell you that I had my doubts, I din't know if it was going to be any good. Luckily the doubts disappeared as soon as I saw the first scene, I'm not going to spoil it but it was an amazing intro to a brilliant movie which is always keeping you interested and intrigued.Disney has a unique, almost magical way of touching your soul, and it did just that in this movie. It will make you feel like a kid again, no matter how old you are. It will make you feel sad, it will make you feel happy and it will make you feel angry. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried a lot and also caught myself yelling at the screen! You share the character's emotions and you are feeling like you belong in the story. Another thing that helps with that is the kid who plays remarkably good, and the dragon that feels like real.I strongly recommend it to you. Anyone can watch it. Your kids, you and even the older people can enjoy this amazing fairy-tale."
" Doesn't hold a candle to the original or even as its own thing....
",0.3182,0.996,2017-02-15 00:00:00,4,"Disney has decided to remake a lot of their older movies. As a business, it's to make a quick buck. I understand that. Sometimes they make a good movie like Cinderella or a great movie like The Jungle Book. Sometimes they make not merely a bad movie but a boring one as well. The 2016 remake of PETE'S DRAGON is that movie.Some might say the original 1977 film was bad in of itself. It's true that it hasn't aged well but it has a campy kitsch quality that's enjoyable and its sincerity was endearing. I admit I have a soft spot for it.The remake on the other hand aims for a modernization of the story which makes it little more than a low rent remake of not the original but rather ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. And a cheap looking one at that. Shot in what looks like the same town as the Twilight movies and creating Elliot using so-so CGI. I can't fault the movie for that;Disney wisely spent their money better on The Jungle Book.Storywise, the mood is low=key and the lighting is bleak. Even outside in the woods, it looks dark and gloomy instead of inviting. It takes a half hour for the plot to get started and another 45 minutes for the plot to get kicking. It's a slog to get through.The characters are stock but given the understated style, they're also dull and uninteresting. Except for Karl Urban as someone who doesn't seem like a villain despite the movie painting him as such. More misguided but whatever, I'm supposed to hate him.To its credit, the message about friendship and family remains intact. Otherwise I think this movie would have been panned as it should have been. Not this ridiculous positivity that it had enjoyed upon its release as a pleasant surprise. That's the real conspiracy there, fanboys."

Animals are primitive, ferocious, vicious and wild, but it's ours, men's point of view. May be they think of us the vice-versa. We fail to see the beauty of them, beauty of this planet. It's because we look upon them with our greedy eyes and filthy souls. But what of a child, who looked in a different way, . He saw them kind, naive and innocent. He could see the goods in them because he acted on the first word, Love! The message was great. To talk about the direction, it's overall an average, sometimes down to the marks direction!

" imaginary would be compelling
",0.2263,0.9188,2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"5 year old Pete is in a car accident that killed his parents. He is saved by a magical dragon named Elliot. Six years later, a crew of lumberjacks is closing in on their home. Pete is taken with Natalie. She's the young daughter of forest ranger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and lumber company owner Jack (Wes Bentley). Grace has been told many times about a dragon by her father Meacham (Robert Redford). Grace and Natalie find the young boy Pete in the woods and take him in. Meanwhile, Jack's brother Gavin (Karl Urban) goes hunting for the mysterious creature in the forest.I like the story, the characters, and the dragon. I can't help but think that the movie could be much better. It could improve with less money and holding back on showing the dragon. There is a natural questioning of Elliot as a figment of Pete's imagination that is missing from the audience. By showing the dragon from the start, Elliot is never in doubt. Heck, the dragon is often invisible. It would be more logical for it to be almost entirely invisible and the audience can wonder whether it's real, imagined, or a projection of Pete's imagination. The reveal would be infinitely more powerful. I like Bryce and the kids. Karl Urban is a little too broad. Robert Redford is odd in his role. He's too big of a movie star. The role should go to an elderly character actor from the retirement home. I have no problem with the look of Elliot but it would be more compelling to reveal him much later in the movie."

Years later the boy is discovers by a ranger.This film has a very nostalgic feel about it. It lacks a lot of the aspects that modern family movies have.The story is very simple with very few plot devices or set pieces. The sound track is quite mournful and bluesy, and tend to play the songs out fully.The CGI on the dragon is absolutely amazing and this is what the kids will love. A lot of thought has gone into the design of the dragon so the story actually works.This film is quite whimsical, there is not an abundant of action or plot so anyone watching this needs a modicum of patience.Well crafted, well thought out a very solid movie with quite a lot of heart. I personally can't see this going toe-to-toe with the likes of Frozen or Maleficent for kids attention, but I preferred this film."
" This remake doesn't soar so high.
",0.0,0.9881,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Disney is knocking out some remakes to their beloved classics as of recently and it seems that they are enlisting the help of some great indie filmmakers to take the reigns of their future tentpole films and revamps. The latest being the remake of 'Pete's Dragon', which originally came out in 1977 and mixed live action with animation. It was a big hit for the studio and became universally loves by children of the 70s and 80s. Cut to present day, and we have Disney making a decent size budget live-action remake of the film with state-of-the-art visual effects and A-List talent behind the film. Not to mention a great indie filmmaker from the DFW area named David Lowery (Ain't Them Body Saints), to co-write and direct this remake.Lowery took a big Disney character and story and grounded it very well, making it look like a great indie film with a giant dragon. There are no buildings or skyscrapers falling to the ground here, which is very refreshing. The story is straight to the point and never goes off on tangents. In fact, the film has about and 80 minute run time, so there is no time for anything else other than the story at hand, which is one of the complaints I have for 'Pete's Dragon'. Here you have the likes of Bryce Dallas Howard, Karl Urban, Wes Bentley, and Robert Redford headlining the cast, but all of them have such little screen time that there is zero character development or transitioning.There is really no reason to care for any of the characters besides Pete (Oakes Fegley) and Elliot the dragon, who forge an unlikely relationship after Pete's parents perish in a car wreck when he's little in the forest. It's very much a story similar to 'E.T.', but without all the emotional tones or fun to it. The dragon himself is very cute and is exactly like your favorite big floppy dog when you were growing up. This dragon has green fur instead of scales and big endearing eyes. He plays fetch and chases its own tale. Soon on though, both Elliot and Pete soon realize they can't live together forever in the forest, and are split up. There's nothing new here that you haven't seen before as far as story or filmmaking, but Lowery really captures the small town life and simplicity of the entire story and characters, perhaps to a bigger degree than it should have been.I'm not saying the movie is bad at all, but to doesn't pack the emotional punch that it was trying to get at, even though there was a ton of sequences I very much enjoyed here, including the usual Disney tropes. I know the younger crowd is going to love it for sure and there is a dose of nostalgia for the older audience as well. You can see why Disney has invested in David Lowery as a director too, since he will be in charge of the 'Peter Pan' revamp next.WORTH A LOOK!"
" Petes dragon
",0.0,-0.9696,2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,Horrible. I miss Redford but this show was terrible. Since when do dragons have fur? Seriously flawed. Yuck yuck yuck. Someone dig Walt up and bring him back to life. The Disney brand has lost its innocence and appeal. Whoever owns Disney now should really go back and do some research. The show seemed more about the set up of the film rather than the quality. The old Disney is way better than stupid Disney remakes. Disney was great because the shows were sad but still uplifting and entertaining at the same time. One thing today's Disney is seriously lacking. I hated this film. It seemed more for the adults than kids. No kid wants to sit through a film that takes itself too seriously. My son is twelve and refuses to watch it because he says they ruined it. This was a terrivbke remake. The worst I've seen from DisneyHave they lost so much talent creativity they have to do all these remakes because they can't come up with their own new stuff? So disappointed. I'll stick with the old version. It has its flaws but wayyyyyyy more entertaining.
" A Good remake of an wonderful story
",0.765,0.981,2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"I loved the original, and found this ""remake"" very good. In the original we had the singing of Helen Redding. In this we had the presence of Bryce Dallas Howard. The story line is I think even better than the original, with more background on Pete and his story. I have read some of the other comments and find them very lacking in any knowledge of the original. No, the story line is different, but it is PURE Disney. Walt would love this. Elliott is different, but I noted that many of his facially expressions reminded me so much of the 1977 Elliott. I can remember the original very well, since when I first saw it I was not a child, but only a child at heart.Well worth watching, if only for the enjoyment."
" For a re-imagining, 'Pete's Dragon' impressed much more than expected
",0.4767,0.9973,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"The 1977 'Pete's Dragon' was a favourite as a child. As far as by today's standards, while not a great film and not as good through adult eyes (plus there are better live-action Disney films, especially the timeless 'Mary Poppins'), it's still well worth watching.Despite having some really talented names on board, expectations were both of great interest but feeling dubious. It did have potential to be better than the 1977 film, and still stand very well on its own, or it could have been a lazy and pointless cash-grab. While it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it proved to be a better film than anticipated.Not one of the best live-action Disney re-imaginings like 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' (much better than 'Maleficent' though), but still for a re-imagining 'Pete's Dragon' was a good one. It is let down by the final act, where the darker and more action-packed tone jars with what was happening before in the film and at this point the film starts to feel rushed. The villain just felt very shoehorned in and out of place, for the sake of ""needing"" an ""obligatory"" villain for conflict (that to me wasn't necessary), not helped by the hammy performance of Karl Urban that just feels out of kilter with the rest of the cast.Where 'Pete's Dragon' especially soars is in the very charming and touching friendship chemistry between Pete and Elliot, essentially the heart of the film. Speaking of Elliot, he is a very lovingly crafted creature with not just beautiful details to him but also with a personality that wins one over in how endearing he is.'Pete's Dragon', apart from some overly grim lighting in places, looks great visually, the splendid scenery being especially good complemented beautifully by cinematography that's atmospheric and picturesque. The music is lovingly whimsical and fits the film well when it could easily have not done.Scripting serves its purpose well and doesn't hurt the atmosphere or the central friendship at all, weakening only with the villain and when the film gets darker. David Lowery directs very capably and balances the various elements well. Although it won't work, and hasn't worked, for some (with criticisms of it being thin narratively, slow-moving and either too sentimental or cold), for me the story (radically altered with a more sombre tone for example) was immensely charming and appreciated the calmer, straightforward, more gentle and deliberate nature of the story which allowed the friendship to resonate. Never found it mawkish and thought that there was enough emotion without it overshadowing things, though admittedly there is not much that is particularly new.Urban aside, the acting is good. Oakes Fegley and Oona Laurence are very appealing, while Bryce Dallas Howard is luminous and compassionate and, while not being on screen for long, Robert Redford achieves the right balance of the grizzled and the sympathetic. But essentially it is Elliot and the friendship between him and Pete that carry the film, and, as they should, captivate most strongly.In summary, while with its foibles 'Pete's Dragon' was a much more impressive re-imagining than expected after mixed expectations. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Watchable but I expected Better! 4/10
",0.63,0.9927,2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"Review: This is another bad live adaptation of a Disney classic! They definitely should have made the dragon speak, like Dragonheart, and I was surprised that Pete was able to fit into normal life so quickly, after living in the wilderness from 5 to 11 years old, with only a dragon as his companion. Anyway, whilst on a day out with his family, Pete (Oakes Fegley) survives a fatal car crash, which kills his parents and leaves him stranded in the wilderness. Out of nowhere, a big Green dragon saves Pete from a pack of wolves, and they instantly become the best of friends. From there, I would have liked to have seen how there friendship developed but the director chose to jump six years into the future, were Pete hears construction workers, chopping down some trees. He is soon gets noticed by Natalie (Oona Laurence) who points him out to her mum, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and they decide to take him in. Whilst getting used to normal life, construction worker, Gavin (Karl Urban) sights the dragon, and he instantly sees it as his enemy, so he tries to capture the friendly giant, with his fellow workers. Pete, who named the dragon Elliott, misses his close friend very much, and Elliott constantly seeks for him in the night. When he finally finds him, he see's that he has settled with his new family, so he goes back into the wilderness longing for his close friend to find his way back to him. Meanwhile, Gavin is adamant about catching the dragon, so he continues to try and find Elliott, even though he has the ability to disappear. Anyway, Grace decides to take Pete to see his dragon, with her daughter Natalie, and her father, Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford), who tells stories to little children about seeing the dragon when he was in the woods. Meanwhile, Grace's boyfriend Jack (West Bentley), who happens to be Gavin's brother, gets a note from Gavin saying that they are going to the woods to hunt for Elliott, so they all head out to the wilderness with different intentions. After Gavin finally achieves his goal, Pete & Natalie fight to save Elliott, with the help of Mr. Meacham, and Pete soon realises that Elliott can only survive if he sets him free. A weird but magical tale of a sweet relationship between a dragon and a little boy, who lost his whole world at such a young age. Personally, I think this movie was a bit too serious, and with all of the technology that is available nowadays, the dragon didn't look that spectacular. I also wasn't that impressed with the plot, which seemed weak and lacked wit, and I did find the little boy slightly annoying. Anyway, it's worth a watch, because of the touching relationship between Pete & Elliott but it could have been much better. Average!Round-Up: Although this movie made a profit at the box office, I personally think that people rushed to see it because it was based on the Disney classic, which doesn't mean that it's a great film. All of the actors put in a decent performance but Robert Redford seemed a bit distant throughout the film, which was surprising for such a veteran in the game. Anyway, this movie was written and directed by David Lowery, who also brought you Deadroom in 2005, St. Nick and Ain't Them Bodies Saints. I'm surprised that David was given such a huge project, because he hasn't actually had that much success in the directing chair. That's not to say that he done a bad job with this movie but I really think that it needed an experienced director to bring this magical story to the big screen. Anyway, is a great film to watch on a family day out but I was expecting more of a spectacular visual experience.Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $142millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/fantasy movies, starring Bryce Dallas Hoard, Robert Redford, Oakes Fegley, Oona Lawrence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Marcus Henderson and Aaron Jackson. 4/10"
" great family movie
",0.6249,0.9672,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I was pretty underwhelmed after watching the movie. The jungle book was renown and popular and almost everyone knew about the same and it was a good retelling of the story nothing spectacular but enjoyable. Pete's Dragon is a heartfelt emotional fantasy film about a child that lives in the woods with a green giant dragon. It is a film that tries to grab you emotionally from the beginning of the film to the very end. Pete's dragon is excellence movie for family. Happy ending.In 1977, Pete, a five-year-old boy, is on a road trip with his parents when their car flips off the road trying to avoid a deer. Pete's parents are killed instantly, but Pete survives and he be rescued by a dragon with green fur, yellow eyes, and huge wings. Pete names the dragon ""Elliot.""Six years later, Pete was spot by Natalie, the daughter of the site foreman. Pete tries to run away, but Gavin, Jack's brother, accidentally knocks him unconscious. After realizing that Pete has vanished, Elliot (the dragon) stumbles around looking for him and ends up knocking over a tree near the lumber camp, leading Gavin to organize a hunting party to find him. Meanwhile, Pete wakes up to find himself in a local hospital, which he escapes in an effort to return to the forest. Before the police can catch him, Grace finds Pete and convinces him to come live with her by promising to take him to the forest the next day.The next day, Pete, Grace, Natalie, and Mr. Meacham travel to the forest to meet Elliot. A group of hunters led by Gavin captured Elliot, locking him up in Jack's warehouse. Before the authorities can inspect Elliot, Pete and Natalie free him from his chains and escape on a lumber truck with Mr. Meacham. Angered, Gavin sets up a roadblock at the bridge to stop them. Confused and frightened, Elliot perches himself atop the bridge and starts breathing fire at the police. The bridge begins to collapse under the intense heat, causing Grace and Jack's truck to fall through. At the last second, Elliot emerges with Grace and Jack on his back. With a military helicopter approaching, Pete decides to flee with Elliot back to the woods.Pete pleads with Elliot to stay with him so he can protect him from his attackers. However, Elliot concludes that as long as they stay close together, Pete will always be in danger because only the dragon can be disappearing. Elliot returns to the mountains, while Pete goes to live with Grace and Jack as his new family."
