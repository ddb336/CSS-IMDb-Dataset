" Prepare for Giggles and tears!
",-0.1007,0.9896,2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Chris Evans appears convincing and confident of his feelings as an unhappy rom-com script writer in Playing it Cool. The plot has him meeting the woman who would change his life at a time when he is almost sure footed about never finding love.The struggle of writers has been portrayed in a lightly funny way as Chris is presented with deadlines and sometimes-uninspiring work. But work does not come in his way to pursue his love interest. However, it takes the lead character to even manipulate his truth at times to impress her, which, of course, bites him in due course!Although it might be difficult to figure out exactly which way the story is headed to even after the first 20 minutes of runtime, the later parts of the movie deserve applause and the end is wrapped beautifully, surely giving the audience something to take away!"
" Waste of their talent and my time.
",0.0,-0.909,2020-06-05 00:00:00,2,"This could have been a fairly decent romantic comedy - it's loaded with talent and the premise is good - but there isn't one single sympathetic character, except maybe for Scott (Topher Grace) and Mallory (Aubrey Plaza) at times.I don't care about any of them or what happens to them. They're a bunch of horrible, selfish people. I gave it two stars only because of the cast. It really deserves zero."
" 3 stars cuz Chris Evans is attractive. Zero stars for the movie
",0.4404,0.8462,2020-05-24 00:00:00,3,"I clicked pass this movie several times until I finally got bored enough during this quarantine to reluctantly give it a watch. Chris Evans is eye candy but that's as far as it goes. The movie is flat and boring. Chris Evan's character is a schmuck and impossible to root for, as is the female love interest. The supporting characters provide no color or flavor. In hindsight I should have just turned it off and gone for a walk."
" discover love
",0.6369,-0.4786,2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,For the people: This movie is a must watch for those who has never been in love or does not believe in love. This will surely help you understand what love is. Very well crafted. By the people.
" What happened
",0.0,0.4939,2019-12-03 00:00:00,4,There was zero chemistry I mean absolutely zero. The only good part of the movie was Aubrey Plaza she kept me giggling. I was waiting for the hulk or Tony Stark to burst through a wall the whole time. I think Evans screwed himself partially as an actor I believe he played Cap 7 or 8 times in the Marvel movies and that's all I see now. I know he made a boatload or money of them but now he's typecast.
" Garbage!!

Didn't even finish the damn thing!!"
" Good
",0.4404,0.9001,2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"Just need to relax, have a good moment
Actors beautiful and cool"
" LOL Hilarious
",0.7378,0.7778,2019-09-03 00:00:00,1,"No, not any of this film. There was not a funny line in the whole script. What was LOL hilarious was that all of these big stars, big directors, producers and marketers blew their wad and barely made a million bucks worldwide. That is just hysterically funny to me and many others. The reviews I read complained about pseudo-intellectual spew fests and unlikable characters, but shouldn't even the worst story and characters at least have some funny lines if it is supposed to be a comedy? Maybe I am old fashioned, but just saying the f word and mentioning Balzac does not make many beyond the newly de-educated laugh.On a serious note, all of these cheeky lines delivered by smirking actors can actually bring on severe nausea. Some people will withdraw into a dark room and stare aimlessly wondering about a purpose. Others will go for another fast food frenzy. That is because we have elevated urban culture; drugs, rap, grousing about injustice on social media, and self-defeating indulgences, while eschewing better vocabularies, building things, reading the classics and working hard. .Life is pretty good here for some people, but not because of Hollywood products, or being one of their sycophants, it is because they have left Hollywood to enjoy real life. Films like this only make life unpleasant."
" Playing It Cool
",0.4767,0.8115,2019-07-20 00:00:00,5,5/10 - a deeply average romance regardless of the occasional heartfelt moment
" Morally Reprehensible Tripe, Avoid This Rubbish
",-0.296,-0.9631,2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"Playing It CoolYet another formulaic romcom that misses the mark. Chris Evans tries his very best in this role but the script is so fatally flawed.1, the girl he fixated on is in a committed relationship, for her to even enter into a ""friendship"" with a man who she knows fancies her is both cruel to him and cheating on an innocent man. We cannot like her or have sympathy for her.2, romcoms have to have a barrier to the couple getting together, but to jolt a man on his wedding date is an ultimate betrayal and unforgivable.3, the woman opening has sex with another man whilst getting married to another, she has the morals of an alley cat.4, his friends tell him to proceed pursuing her, no friend would do this. No no no.5, the gathering crowd scene in the pursuit of love where a man says "" you going to wreck someone's wedding day"" as if that was a good thing is morally reprehensible.6, no relationship can survive built upon the carnage of wrecked lives.The script was appalling and sent all the wrong messages, these writers should never work again who created this tripe"
" Falls Into the Cliche's it Swears to Avoid
",-0.25,0.7615,2019-06-03 00:00:00,5,"There have been many great rom-coms over the last 10 years, but it's a largely dead genre, at least when it comes to movies that make it into theaters. 'Playing it Cool' is just about as cliche as they come with this genre, even though the film tries its darndest to do the opposite. Chris Evans and Michelle Monaghan play the two central characters, both of which I love in just about anything, but they are given next to nothing with this script. It's also the only film Justin Reardon has ever directed, which should tell you something about how this film was received within the industry. Perhaps the worst part is that it feels long at 90 minutes. That's when you know something is wrong with your pacing, writing, and direction. 'Playing it Cool' contains a few moments of genuine charm, purely from its actors, only to be outdone by the next extremely cliche plot point.5.4/10"
" My husband and I loved this film
",0.5994,0.882,2019-03-16 00:00:00,10,"Creative and entertaining. If you like rom-coms then you'll likely love it. If you don't you still might, but don't hate on it if you don't."
" One of the best romcoms available, and I've seen a TON AND A HALF OF EM
",0.6369,0.9838,2019-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Me (Chris Evans) is a screenwriter who likes action films. Yet, unexpectedly, his boss asks him to write a romcom in order to land the next big action gig. This causes the writer great anguish, for he has never been in love. The reason? He doesn't trust a soul since his mother attached a goodbye note to his favorite Captain Crunch cereal box and left him in the care of G-pa (an outstanding Philip Baker Hall). He half-heartedly pitches an unusual romantic comedy idea between two folks with multiple personalities and his boss sends him home to work. Writers' block ensues. When his best pal Scott (Topher Grace) asks him to attend a charity event with him, Me agrees. Stop the presses! Its there he meets HER (Michelle Monaghan) who dazzles him and makes him laugh by saying audacious lines to all men. Yet, Me doesn't catch her name. What follows is NO screenplay writing and a wild pursuit of major charity events to find her again. Even then, though they spark a friendship, she announces she's engaged. Horrors, what will happen now? His friends including Scott, Samson (Luke Wilson), Mallory (Aubrey Plaza) and others try to give him the advice of a lifetime. Will he finish the screenplay and get the girl? This vastly enjoyable romcom has one of the wittiest and most clever scripts this longtime romcom fan has ever viewed. No, its not clean Doris Day stuff but as a PG -13, its not majorly offensive while being very, very romantic. All of the cast members do enchanting work and the scenery, costumes, and direction merit big raves. Towering over all is the great plot and words, words, words. Don't play it cool with this one, folks! Get it five minutes from now."
" Good chemistry
",0.4404,0.9348,2018-12-17 00:00:00,7,Evans and Monaghan have really good chemistry on screen. I am surprised at the quality of Evan's acting chops. I think the guy is pretty talented. He's able to pull off drama and comedy well.
" Truly bad
",-0.1531,-0.7813,2018-09-06 00:00:00,3,"There is virtually nothing good about this movie. It had no charm. It had almost no plot. It wasn't funny. It wasn't well acted. The ""connection"" between the two romantic leads was about as believable as a unicorn falling in love with a giraffe.Rom Coms aren't supposed to be the tightest movies of the cinematic sphere. The boy always gets the girl. Two people who deny their love always get together. Obstacles impede forward movement until they finally give way to the inevitable. That's the genre. We all know where it's going, and it never changes. That said, as a viewer, we should want to see the two romantic characters unite. We should care about their obstacles and yearn for them to wake up to the reality and possibility of the power of their togetherness. In this movie, I couldn't have cared less about everything. It's surprising, actually, because the cast is not a bunch of indie unknowns. I recognized every major character (except the female lead) by face, if not by name. The budget couldn't have been tiny. And yet, this was a movie with as much substances as Wonder bread, and was about as unappetizing at Wonder bread as well. Terrible acting. Terrible script. Terrible story. Not a single romantic moment. No chemistry. Idiotic tropes. The one thing I enjoyed was when the movie was over.Rom Coms are notoriously terrible, because most of them are sloppily done for quick commercial release for mindless profit. Occasionally, if there are just a few redeemable qualities, Rom Coms can be fun to watch, if in the mood or late at night or if mourning the loss of a love. This movie, however, had almost nothing to make it worth even a look. Save yourself two hours. Avoid this like the plague. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of space. It's a waste of effort.I've seen worse, but this movie is truly bad."
" Really enjoyable twist on a rom com
",0.4927,0.9753,2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I never quite understand why people feel the need to over analyse every movie they ever see and look for some deeper hidden meaning, not every movie needs to be Arthouse and edgy. Sometimes it's good to just sit back and enjoy something less heavy and enjoy it for what it is.. light entertainment. This fell under that category for me and really hit the spot. Funny in parts, great actors and likeable quirky characters and some sweet moments."
" Better than I thought it would be.
",0.4404,0.9789,2018-06-08 00:00:00,10,"It is a good flick. The strangeness of the supporting characters is what friends area actually like. This is a little typical of a Rom-Com but it is excellent for what it is. I love it my, wife loved it and it is worth a watch!"
" semi-bland
",0.0,0.8386,2018-05-12 00:00:00,5,"A Hollywood screenwriter (Chris Evans) is assigned to write a rom-com. The problem is that he wants to write action and has never been in love. Being abandoned by his mother at an early age has left him commitment phobic. His group of writer friends include Mallory (Aubrey Plaza), Lyle (Martin Starr), Samson (Luke Wilson), and Scott (Topher Grace). It's love at first sight when he meets a woman (Michelle Monaghan) at a charity event except she already has a boyfriend. Writers Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair also wrote Chris Evans' directorial debut. So it's not a shock to see Evans involved in this one and he probably brought along all these friends of his. The premise has limited bite and even less originality. There's nothing new here. Plaza does have great fun playing the wackiest of the group. The romantic couple is saved by Evans' inherit personal charms. I love Monaghan but she's not better than peak Meg Ryan. There's even a diner scene but this movie is nowhere near the icon. Other problems include the use of the lead characters in the imagined stories. They are obviously trying hard to be magically charming but all they do is to leave the movie in neutral. They lack anything interesting to justify taking a break from the plot such as there is one. Generally, this is a bland rom-com with one or two funny side characters."
" The chemistry between Evans and Monaghan was a dud
",-0.25,0.9104,2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"3/23/18. For some reason you never know how a romantic comedy is going to play with Chris Evans. I liked him as the Harvard Hottie in The Nanny Diaries, and he was great as the next-door neighbor of Anna Faris in What's Your Number? But, for some reason there was little chemistry between him and Monahan in this one, which made the ending a long stretch. Watch it if you like Evans, but don't expect it to be one of his better rom-com outings."
" A Fun Movie!
",0.5562,0.8748,2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Sometimes, it's great just to turn over control of your brain to your TV set and let it entertain you. This movie has a simple plot that follows the the typical rom com formula with a few twists. However, in my opinion, it has likable characters and a likable plot. Overall, it's a fun use of an hour and a half!"
" A Couple's Magical Connection Hampered by Emotional Barriers
",0.1531,0.9701,2017-06-05 00:00:00,5,"Due to an emotional event early in his childhood, a self-centered, young man known simply as ""Me"" (Chris Evans) doesn't know how to fall in love with a woman even though he has no problems dating them. That all changes one day when he meets a young lady known by the equally simple moniker of ""Her"" (Michelle Monaghan) who essentially has the same problem. Yet even though their connection is magical and they clearly enjoy each others company, the fact of the matter is that she is engaged and has no intention of breaking it off with her fiancé even though she doesn't love him. Needless to say, this causes him a great deal of anguish and as a result he turns to his circle of friends for advice. The problem is that they are just as emotionally mixed up as he is and as a result he doesn't know which advice to accept or reject. To make matters even worse, as a writer he has been given a certain amount of time to come up with a script for a rom-com for which he is totally out of his element given his past and current emotional state of affairs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay rom-com which had a good supporting cast and some very likable characters. I especially liked ""Scott"" (Topher Grace) and ""Mallory"" (Aubrey Plaza) along with the two lead actors mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, for a romantic-comedy it lacked the necessary humor which is vitally important for a film of this type. As a result I have rated this film accordingly. Average."
