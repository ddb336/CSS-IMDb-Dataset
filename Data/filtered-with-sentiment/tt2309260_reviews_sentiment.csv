" Actually scary
",-0.4939,-0.3101,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"I am usually not the one to be scared from horror movies, however Gallows has surprised me...a low budget film was able to provide great suspense through the film creating very high stress moments for me and my colleagues, we were not expecting such a thrilling ride but were not disappointed, I feel as though this film rivalled many large budget Hollywood horror movies. The ending however was a surprising twist however was not expected. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it's creativity and hope that any viewers who wish to watch a refreshing horror film I highly suggest."

" Unbelievably bad
",-0.5849,-0.1753,2021-03-29 00:00:00,2,"I made it through the entire thing, so I guess that saves Gallows from being a 1.This entire cast is awful, but the choice for the ""main character"" is just baffling. On top of that, the characters are all horribly written. The plot meanders for far too long for any kind of payoff to be fulfilling, but the payoff also just doesn't exist.I only pressed play because Prime Video shows this as a 4.5/5 star movie. Absolutely no one watched this and gave a 4 or 5 star review. There is zero reason to watch The Gallows. Plenty of decent to good found footage movies exist."
" SCARY

Twenty years later, on the eve of the play's revival, students Reese, Pfeifer, Ryan and Cassidy become trapped in the auditorium, with no way of calling for help. A night of terror awaits the four friends as they face the wrath of a malevolent and vengeful spirit. It seems Charlie will have his curtain call after all.The Gallows is a low budget found footage horror. It is full of tension and jumpscares well placed. While the script isn't quite good and the end is ridicolous the overall movie is well made and mostly scary.Rating: 8."
" Shallow little horror film has great potential, but amounts to nothing
",0.0891,0.7267,2021-02-25 00:00:00,3,"Although it has some sparks throughout of being a generally decent thriller, The Gallows amounts to nothing but being another lifeless and incredibly predictable little found footage film, with almost nothing at all new or worthy to offer. My greatest complaint with this film has to be the editing and the acting, two very essential components in any film, especially with films like this. The acting is godawful, I've seen better actors in middle school plays than i've seen from these schmoes and not only that, but the characters are incredibly shallow and truly just the most cliche archetypes you will ever see in a horror flick. I appreciate what the film is trying to do, even though it fails drastically at doing so. The setup and plot can be interesting, but its too forced to be any fun, and oddly insensitive to its own dark origins- playing suicide off as a joke, and providing little to no reason why the horror occuring is happening at all. It's never a good question to ask while watching a movie, but more than any film i've seen in a while, The Gallows made me ask just why? It's a terrible screenplay, despite its interesting concept, its choppy editing making the illogical storyline even less coherent. I didn't hate this film, but it frustrated me, because there was truly something genius deep down in here, but instead, it's nothing but a complete and utter dud.
My Rating: 3.5/10"

It makes no sens, no one seemed to have any clue what they were doing (some of the actors did okay, but that's it). Which makes sense because this was literally a STUDENT FILM. And even if you didn't hate it as much as I did how could it possibly be ""one of your favorite horror movies"" or ""pretty scary."" Either you're sheltered and have never seen a good horror movie in your life, or you're 6.Found footage movies NEVER make any sense because there is o reason that they would keep recording if they were in danger of dying. There are some instances where they work around that like Lake Mungo or Creep (or even Paranormal Activity) but this movie has no idea how to do any of that. It just wants to be another found footage movie and is clearly made by inexperienced people as it is a STUDENT FILM.The fact that google users gave this the same amount of praise as Hereditary is honestly disgusting."

" Gets better after the very silly teenager first half
",0.5095,-0.1756,2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"For the first half of The Gallows I was on the brink of either fast-tracking to the final scene, or giving up and watching something else. I hung in there, and I'm glad I did, because it did eventually turn into a decent horror movie. For me, I've never been a fan of the hand held genre. I never found Blair Witch(1999) particularly easy to watch, and recoiled with horror as the genre took off, and I guess its here to stay with us now that everyone has an iPhone. To me it just seems lazy, and also the genre tends to need heightened drama to compensate for a lack of ordinary soundscape. The Gallows is no different. It starts off with all the things a lot of us hate about teen movies. At least two of the teens look to be in their twenties, and in any case their behaviour is far more typical of emotionally charged and grossly immature 14 year olds, not to mention there's a very in-your-face joker in the pack as well. And of course they all go to complete pieces when the chips are down. If you can get past that and somehow get used to the hand held shake and constant tech buffer interference and scrambling shots of feet running, well, there is a decent horror movie under it all, and The Gallows does score points for originality, and there is a fair chance you will enjoy it."

" Decent found footage horror outing
",-0.5719,-0.941,2020-01-02 00:00:00,6,"1993. A teenage actor in a high school play meets a brutal untimely end after a terrible accident occurs. Twenty years later a theater group at the high school decide to do another production of the play. However, several students take it upon themselves to sabotage said production by sneaking into the school late at night so they can trash the set.This film certainly starts with a jolting bang and concludes on a pleasing dark note. Moreover, writers/directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing do manage to generate a reasonable amount of tension and creepy atmosphere. Alas, the laborious opening third proves to be a real slog to get through. Worse yet, the three kids who sneak into the school to vandalize the set are extremely annoying and unlikeable, with obnoxious wisecracking troublemaker Ryan rating as by far the single most hateful and irritating of the rotten lot. The deliberately sloppy hand-held cinematography doesn't help matters much as well. Fortunately, the game no-name cast all give perfectly acceptable performances and the despicable jerks all bumped off in highly satisfying nasty ways. An okay time-waster, but overall nothing special."

I bet a lot of them also believe aliens killed JFK on orders from Bigfoot too. (Cthulhu actually ordered it) I thought this movie was really good. Yes there are a couple of plot holes like if the play was done 20 years ago how is Charlie's kid still in high school? But most of the other questions people raised were answered in the movie. Maybe they should've stayed till the end or payed attention?
Unlike a lot of horror movies, and that's pretty much all I watch, this one has a complex plot. In 1993 a high school drama club put on the play The Gallows. During which Charlie was hung and died. 20 years later Pfifer picks that play to do again. 3 kids break into the school to destroy the set when they run into Pfifer. Things start going sideways and the creep factor kicks in.
Special effects are minimal but done very effectively. Jumps scares are earned. It has a very claustrophobic feel to it. May I suggest watching this one with the lights off! But definitely watch this!!"

" The Gallows kept hanging around for nothing and had me wanting to use a noose.
",0.0,-0.957,2019-07-06 00:00:00,2,"Was the production budget dangling on a string of rope or something? Because this was cheaper than a school theatre production! The inexpensive and simple conception of ""found footage"" films has resulted in many horror films tackling a variety of different ghouls who adore scaring the ""bajeezus"" out of youths and depicting pitch black environments. Sprawling woodlands, claustrophobic catacombs and even an abandoned mental institution.Well, what's the scariest place for students? High school, obviously! Shame the film was tamer than an amateur reenactment of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew'. A small cluster of students break into school one night to wreck a stage production of 'The Gallows', a play to which an understudy was accidentally killed years before.Firstly, let me address the face-palming stupidity that exists in this snooze-fest. Why would a school actively agree to create another production of a play to which an actual death occurred? There would be an uprising from parents! Especially those that were actually in the original production. Also, why would any student (although let's be honest, these actors look far too old) break into school in the middle of night? Their motives were flimsy to say the least, and it was bound to be a predictable recipe for disaster. The characters themselves were one-dimensional, emotionless and, particularly the main camera holder, irritating beyond belief. Seriously, the immature humour and childish antics were enough to get that moron a year's worth of detention. Shut the eff up and get hanging!The atmosphere was hugely lacking due to the vast amount of ""found footage"" clichés which inadvertently failed to create any scares. Characters will stand in the middle of the camera if something happens and the typical bass kicks in to inform you that ""horror"" is coming. A few slow moving background shots enable one or two chills to invade your body, but no where near enough. Oh, and the ending? What even! The Gallows should be sent to the gallows immediately."

They find Pfeifer there and get hounded inside the locked auditorium by mysterious forces.It's over 15 years since The Blair Witch Project. The found footage horror is getting a little tiresome at this point. The story is a fine uninspired haunted house horror. The young actors are also fine. Their characters have no depth. The camera POV is fine at times but it is getting stale. More than anything, it's a device to hide the low budget and poor directing. Of course, everybody knows this and it only reinforces the lack of money and lack of directing skills.

" Hang 'Em High. ALL of them!
",0.0,-0.9912,2018-11-08 00:00:00,2,"I lost count of the number of times that I swore to myself not to watch any more of these lousy ""found-footage"" horror flicks, and yet I keep making the same mistake over and over again. I really should follow my own advice, though. After all, there's only one truly genius found-footage movie (that would be ""Cannibal Holocaust"") and just a few that are remotely worthwhile (like ""REC"", ""The Bay"" or ""The Borderlands""). And yes, I'm fully aware that I'm not including so-called masterpieces like ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""Cloverfield"" because they are, in fact, rubbish! ""The Gallows"" is even worse than rubbish; - an utterly boring and amateurish effort with an uninteresting story, loathsome lead characters and shaky camera movements that are possibly even more irritating than in every other found-footage movie ever made. Is there seriously anyone curious to learn the history of a geek who accidentally died 20 years ago during the performance of a high-school play. No? Too bad, because that's what ""The Gallows"" is about. In the same school in middle-of-nowhere Nebraska, new geeks are rehearsing for the same play in which poor Charlie got hung in front of a full theater. For some unclear reason, however, supposedly cool but dumb kids intend to wreck the scenery and decors in the night before the big premiere. They quickly come to regret it, of course, as Charlie's ghost haunts the school hall and clearly wants his tribute to take place. The routine of these zero-budgeted ""found footage"" movies is overly familiar by now. Nothing happens until the final five minutes, except maybe a couple of blurry ghost-apparitions. Then we get some vague and unidentifiable action-shots and a bit of hysterical shrieking, and then it's finished. What makes ""The Gallows"" even more unendurable is that the lead characters are beyond stupid, and the school setting is so damn dull and customary. Other found-footage movies suck too, but at least they are set in abandoned asylums, desecrated churches or whatever. I'm generously giving one additional point because Cassidy Gifford is pretty to stare at for as long as she doesn't talk too much."

Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler) joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films. We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming.

" Boring and Plain Bad
",-0.7003,-0.9894,2018-09-04 00:00:00,1,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie and read the plot summary, it did not seem very promising to me. However, some time later I decided to give The Gallows a chance and watch it on VOD. Turns out that this 2015 ""found footage"" horror is probably the worst wide theatrical release movie of 2015. Every minute of it is so badly thought-out, scripted, acted & shot, that I wonder why anyone went throught the trouble of making a marketing campaign and distributing it, and more importantly why so many people went to see it at the big screens (this mess apparently earned an astonishing 40 million USD at the box office).
So the film's premise is very simple and from the very start it's obvious it's going to be about a group of teenagers filming themselves being haunted in their high school by a ghost of a student who had died during a school play. However, this simple plot has a needlessly convoluted introduction as much of the movie is spent introducing numerous characters doing various activites, but that's all just filler because the whole movie follows just 4 characters which means that more than 90% of the film's cast is in it for no reason. When the horror starts (and it takes a lot of time for it to start) most scenes are filmed in such an annoyingly bad lighting (even for a found footage movie) and everything looks so unnatural and staged, that it's really hard to even follow the movie, let alone care about anything that happens in it. The scene with the girl in red lights from the film's poster is supposed to be the highlight of the movie, but the way it's filmed differs significantly from the rest of the movie. The acting is mediocre throughout the movie, but near the ending it worsens and becomes laughably bad. There are some moments when we get to see the ghost as a physical creature, and it looks so cheaply made that I could literally make a better costume with stuff from my wardrobe.
Also, I don't want to spoil anything (even for such a bad movie) but at the very end there is supposed to be a huge plot twist, but it's so unbelievable & illogical & badly executed, that it's impossible to care or be surprised by it.
All in all, the Gallows is an unusually bad and boring movie, even for its genre, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
" Utter Crap

" I Think the Found Footage Genre Has Overstayed its Welcome
",0.4588,-0.9957,2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"In recent years, horror movies have come with critical and financial revenue, such as Insidious, Get Out, Don't Breathe, and A Quiet Place. Unfortunately, for every gem there's always a rough spot, and this film falls into that category. The found footage genre seems to be looked down upon in this day in age for how cheap and low quality they're seen to be, and after seeing this film, I don't think that sentiment will be changed anytime soon.Set twenty years after an accident during a high-school play called ""The Gallows"", some students try to recreate the play again. Soon after, students Reese, Pfeifer, Ryan and Cassidy get trapped in the auditorium whilst facing the wrath of the vengeful spirit of the kid who died on that fateful night. I'm ok with simple plots, but the story just isn't engaging enough to warrant an hour and a half of viewing. As such, the film becomes tedious as we merely subject ourselves to a lot of running, yelling, obnoxious acting, and a highly predictable payoff. This probably wouldn't be much better as a short film, but at least it would've been over quicker.Adding into that, you'd think the cast would at least be interesting, but there is not one likable character in this whole affair. Reese has little charisma or unique qualities to make him stand out, Pfeiffer's bossiness and demand to finish the play presents her as rather moody, and Cassidy.......uh......I got nothing about her. However, the worst offender is Ryan. I'm sure the filmmakers intended to make him snarky and arrogant, but he becomes obnoxious very fast since all he does is film stuff and annoy people for nearly thirty minutes. Also, it's funny how one of the students can't act in the play when the actor himself can't act in the movie either. When not even the acting is convincing enough, there's lots to be desired with these bland and unlikable characters.It's obvious this film was made on a low budget with the setting mostly consisting of a school, but that's where the film's cinematography also becomes problematic. Given that this is found footage, it becomes annoying and gimmicky to a fault, and the usage of filming everything in front, even during chase scenes, becomes old quick. Even the props range from a rope and a ladder and not much else, making the experience more lackluster than scary. There isn't even any reason for this to be found footage; they could have shot this any other way and nothing would change at all.Now I don't think jump scares are inherently weak, as they can work well if given the proper buildup and tension. In this case though, the jump scares just happen on a wham, making them feel unwarranted and tiresome. Even one scene with Cassidy sobbing by a stairway (which can be seen on the poster) that is built up with surprisingly slow and subtle atmosphere gets ruined by a cheap jump scare from the spirit. Considering that this film is supposed to be set up as pasted together clips of the story from the police department, one would expect even they would get bored of this drowsy experience.Did this film have potential? Kind of, as it does paint itself as a revenge tale of a high schooler named Charlie who accidentally died during the 1993 performance and is determined to have the play finished with one of the students, being Pfeiffer. There is a way to make a story like that work, maybe if Pfeiffer was the daughter of a girl Charlie got pregnant in high school and maybe just wanted to complete a father daughter play. Sadly, all that potential is squandered away for a cheap production set, a boring story, hollow and despicable characters, and nothing else to stand out in the horror genre. There are great horror films out there in the world worth cherishing for eons, but this film will forever be locked in purgatory with all the forgettable horror flicks that favor cheapness over quality."

When it came out on iTunes (the most convenient place for me to watch it), I immediately rented it without reading the reviews. I loved it. I consider myself a horror movie buff. I'm so desensitized to horror movies that I fell asleep during The Exorcist. However it took me hours to fall asleep after The Gallows. The ""villain"" was depraved, yet relatable, the scares happened when you least expect them to, and the setting was perfect.
The next day, I went to IMDB to review it, and was horrified to see the reviews. People have trashed this movie for no reason. Maybe they just don't come in contact with modern high school students, because the actors pulled off their roles marvelously."
" Tragic.
",-0.4588,-0.9753,2018-04-04 00:00:00,1,"If I could give this film a lower rating I would. This has got to be the most transparently predictable and dull film I have ever seen. The writing, the performances, the camera work, everything, is terrible.The writing is so stilted and obvious its as if the writers think the audience is a bunch of idiots. Lines that are set-ups for future events are so blatant, and the writing overall is just irritating, especially anything coming out of the mouth of the cameraman, who is possibly the worst character in any film I have seen.The acting is over the top and makes the film feel stupid, which makes the already bad plot seem even worse. To tell you the plot would be a waste of time as it has no sort of worth to anyone in any way. It's that bad.Finally, the fact this is a found footage style film adds nothing to the plot, and if anything only seems to be done to keep the budget down. Again, the nonsensical plot makes it seem even more idiotic. Found footage is meant to add a layer of realism to a story and so when the story, dialogue and characters seem unnatural, it completely goes against the purpose of the filming style. It's literally just so that they can save some money and make a ton more profit than they otherwise would off this piece of crap.Overall, don't watch it, it's bad. If you want to get a better idea of how painful the film is, I suggest watching the first 5 minutes and listening closely to that stilted dialogue. It's the same throughout the entire movie, and it doesn't get better. It's awful. Don't watch."

It's one of those films which typically consists of a lot of screaming and a lot of running around through dark corridors. There's little in the way of special effects and the actors have to put a lot of work in to convince you of their fear, but they're generally not bad. On the downside, this is an entirely predictable outing and nothing that takes place hasn't been done better before. However, I still enjoyed it to a degree, as it's one of those amiable time-wasters that gets the job done."
" A Movie Worthy of The Gallows
",0.4404,-0.9478,2017-10-10 00:00:00,1,"I have never really been a fan of ""found footage"" movies. I really can't explain why. There's just something to a movie where you stay in your seat and don't move with the director that makes it more enjoyable. I wish I could say the same about this. For the record, I am always on the hunt for horror movies that seem interesting or those that other people watch and can't stop talking about them. With this, I will admit that I was drawn in by some previews that I saw during TV commercials. It all begins with the performance of a high school play called (of course) ""The Gallows."" (Really original, right?) One of the performers is accidentally killed by a noose on the stage. Fast-forward 20 years and a group of high school students go to the school where it took place to check it out, just to see if they encounter the ghost of the performer who died onstage.Before you know it, just about everyone is picked off one by one by some supernatural force that they believe is the ghost of that particular actor. This isn't even worthy of being called a horror movie. It has no scares, little to no suspense, and all of the actors look like they're in a daze three-quarters of the time. To sum it up, it is just lazy with a capital L.Don't even watch this on a bet. I was bored almost into a coma by the time the movie was through. Spend an hour and a half (or however long this was; I almost forgot how long it was for good reason) watching something else."
" A night before the play!
",0.4003,0.8513,2017-10-04 00:00:00,2,"It is my personal opinion that I did not find the film any good. There's nothing new in it. Even those who haven't seen many films could name a couple of similar films. The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.The basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.2/10"
" A Found Footage Gem
",0.0,-0.9865,2017-09-17 00:00:00,7,"The Gallows is a found footage horror movie, released in 2015. From directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing, this is a school based found footage movie, focusing on the brutal accident of previous student, Charlie Grimille. Twenty years after a school production of ""The Gallows"" leads to the death of Charlie Grimille after a props malfunction, the high school drama club decides to remake the stage production to honour the anniversary of the tragedy. However, they soon find that some things are much, much better left alone. I admit, this movie started off extremely slowly. I wasn't that interested in what was happening, other than the very first scene that showed the accident with Charlie, but as with most found footage horror movies, I had to see it through. The beginning of most found footage horror movies are incredibly slow, something that I really wish had not become a trope of the genre, and this is definitely no different. I was very tempted to turn it off. It took around half an hour, forty minutes for this to finally kick in, and when it did, oh boy.I'm not weak to horror. I can gladly sit and watch what are considered the scariest horror movies, and come out of them bored and not scared at all but this movie, damn. The Gallows is an expert at building up the atmosphere, and making the goosebumps appear on your skin. It's absolutely brilliant at bringing up a situation that you know is going to happen, you know this one moment is going to happen, but when it does happen – you're creeped out and a little scared. The atmospheric build up is absolutely spectacular, and I don't think a found footage horror movie has ever made me feel so uneasy before – especially with the numerous night vision scenes. Of course, the plot is pretty basic; four teenagers trapped in their school, and a dead student is haunting them and killing them off one by one. It's not a terribly original entry into the found footage genre, but the acting is what really sets this apart from the others, in my opinion. I find in a lot of found footage horror movies, the actors don't seem to always put on a good show, they seem to be lacking. Maybe they know it's a bit of bad movie and they just don't really care, but in The Gallows, all four of the main actors did a brilliant job. You could feel their fear, you could connect in with their emotions, and really understand where they were coming from. Especially with actor Reese Mishler, who played the lead male, Reese Houser. There were pure moments with him where I was so scared I couldn't look away from the screen, I could not move, purely from him acting as scared as he was.This got a lot of bad criticism for a movie, and I'm beginning to feel this is more of a distaste for the found footage genre more than anything, and I think this movie definitely deserves a watch. It was atmospheric, it was scary, things were clear, and it wasn't just another ghost on a rampage. Not original in it's entry, but rather original within it's plot as a movie, and I would definitely give this another watch. This is one of those rare gems of the found footage genre, and I'm definitely glad that I gave this a chance."
" Made Rob Zombie Halloween II (2009) look good
",-0.1779,-0.9608,2017-09-17 00:00:00,1,"Yeah this is a awful movie. The worst horror movie ever been made since Prom Night (2008). This so not scary including terrible acting and awful story line. This is another film I watch that I watch that I forgot to review until I watch a video about Blum House that'll mess up a horror movie sometimes. I'll break that disc if I own it and I'll never will EVER!!! Don't watch this over hype garbage just watch better horror movies like Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Hellrasier, Saw, and etc. Blum House deserve to stop making horror movies."
" One of the worst films i ever seen!!
",-0.6892,-0.9662,2017-07-12 00:00:00,1,This film is terrible. The actors are so bad. Everything is so stupid. It's not scary only really stupid. How can anyone think this is a good idea? It is a bit funny to watch how bad everything isDon't waste your timeI have to make this review longer for some reason It's stupid because there is not more to say about this terrible movie
" If you sit through this, you must have no life
",-0.296,-0.1779,2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"I would give this a zero if the IMDb rating scale allowed me to. The plot summary on Netflix suggested this might be an intriguing, if low budget, horror flick. The fact that I had never heard of any of the ahem, ""actors"" (if one can use that term for a bunch of nobodies who decided they just had to make a movie)should, in retrospect, be the first clue that a viewer is about to see something best left unseen. I closed ""The Gallows"" at about the four minute mark, having seen enough to know that it wasn't going to get any better. Seriously, to any aspiring low budget film-maker out there, the hand-held video recording of events in faux documentary style is really old. It was novel when ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released back in 1999, not any more."
" A high school play honors a previous tragedy.
",0.0772,-0.5714,2017-04-19 00:00:00,5,"Observing the 20th anniversary of a student's accidental death during a high school play; the current group of drama students want to honor the flawed production by reproducing it. Superstitions abound and too foolish to face any real fear, these amateur thespians proceed with even more disastrous consequences.No real horror to deal with. No disturbing scenes you haven't seen before. But THE GALLOWS is well done, well paced...just nothing to keep you at the edge of your seat. You may even wonder how it earned an R rating. Not to say this flick won't sustain your attention.Featured in the cast: Pfeifer Brown, Reese Mishler, Cassidy Gifford, David Herrara, Mackie Burt, John Hales, Ryan Shoos, Jordan Rheane Murphy and Travis Cluff, the director and co-writer."
" If you're a lover of found footage, give this one a shot.
",0.5859,0.9895,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Now before I go on about this, I do enjoy most of the Paranormal Activity series. The 4th and 6th one were kinda meh, in my opinion but I've always loved the style. I've also seen Area 51 directed by the same guy who made those, and I was pleased to see this was too. For me, this absolutely blew Paranormal Activity out of the park. Yes it has cliché moments, but not as predictable as those movies. If you love found footage movies, especially with twist endings, I 100% recommend this movie. Not gonna give it 10 out of 10 cause of course this is a recurring style genre which MANY get bored of but I eat it up. Loved it, would watch it again. Would recommend especially with a friend."
" I'd rather ask the hangman to hang me than have to watch this again.
",0.0,0.9459,2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Literally JUST signed up to write a bad review for this one. If you want to see people running around in the dark and asking yourself 'why are they filming?!' this is definitely the movie for you. If you want to watch something better then this, just stare at the blank TV screen in your living room and it will be worth the wild. Thank you IMDb for telling me to write minimum of 10 lines of text in order to be able to be posted. Now I can trash this trashy movie about a group of stupid teenagers with a douche bag as the main character. Yes, another one of those.... Yay. We all have to thank the blonde for getting choked and then asking what happened? And the best part of this movie, and this part isn't sarcastic, is the end when the policemen walk into the house... filming and you can finally see the beautiful costume that probably costed as much as the film made.... $4.00 And now, I'm done. Thank you world for making another crappy ""found footage"" movie.... Yeah, ""found""...."
