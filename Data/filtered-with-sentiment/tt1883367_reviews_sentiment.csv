" Stupid.
",-0.5267,0.4939,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,This film is an insult to good taste. I don't recognize any segment of the film as positive. Very stupid...I dont know what to say anymore.
" A Case of Bigger Not Being Better
",-0.3412,-0.4684,2021-03-12 00:00:00,4,"Honestly, everyone who makes it through all 3 of these movies should be rewarded, because it takes a special kind of person to see the original and come back not once, but twice, looking for more.
In this supposedly ""final"" entry in the Centipede film series, Tom Six really ups the stakes by sticthing together 100 people in a prison setting, letting loose anything and everything he can possibly think of to shock and revolt the polite society. This film is a middle finger to political correctness and, despite being the weakest entry in the film, it really succeeded well in that regard.
Dieter Laser's brutally hateful character gets a ton of screen time, yelling at the top of his lungs at anyone, everyone and everything. Demanding castrations and eating the remains. It really doesn't leave anything to the imagination, and there are no lines or boundaries they aren't willing to cross.
Laser (who played the evil doctor in the original), unfortunately, is a little bit too committed to this part, overacting to the point of being either satirical or unintelligible. It's the kind of thing you would watch to be able to say you've seen it (""I watched every entry in the Human Centipede trilogy!""), but not something you would ever put on for a casual Saturday afternoon viewing. Not something you would unwind to, and definitely not something you would watch for a date night or house party.
I'm glad I watched it, but I couldn't recommend it."

People have complained about Lawerence Harvey and Dieter Laser's acting. Remember Dieter Laser is playing a psychopathic crazy deranged prison warden, I think his constant screaming compliments his behavior perfectly. Lawerence Harvey's acting wasn't as good as his performance in the second movie, but he is still believable as a semi reluctant accomplice to Dieter Laser's character. I also enjoyed the reddish tint to the screen throughout the movie and the gore scenes. I get this type of movie isn't for all, but if you can handle gore and understand why the characters act the way they do it will be entertaining."

" Weakest in the trilogy but a decent watch
",-0.2846,-0.9547,2020-05-26 00:00:00,5,"Tom Six's Human Centipede 3, though being the weakest film in the trilogy, is by no means a disappointment. Tonally it is a mess; the film can't decide whether it wants to be a comment on the justice system in America or a B movie shlock fest or a twisted 80's sitcom. Where the first two films were stylistically consistent; the first a cliche 2000's horror movie and the second a black and white shock fest, this film never seems to find its feet. The comedy rarely lands, the lighting choicing creates a strange cheesy tone and the dialogue see saws from entertainingly bad to just bad. The performances vary in quality also. Dieter Laser as Warden Bill Boss, screams and yells his way through the film to the point where it becomes annoying; starting somewhat entertaining and eventually he just becomes a headache. Not only chewing his way through dried clitoruses, but every scene he is in. These movies arent about subtilty and nuance but the character work here is simply poor. He lacks the intensity and sinister demeanor of which he so brilliantly portrayed in the first film. Laurence R. Harvey on the other hand is a scene stealing charm as Bill's accountant Dwight Butler. Though the accent comes and goes, the characters twisted mindset is so subtly undermined by Harvey's fantastic portrayal of a man struggling to balance keeping his job whilst pleasing his sadistic boss. The less said about Bree Olson's Daisy, the better. As for the infamous human centipede itself, the concept falls horrifically flat, the idea itself is brilliant however the execution, less so. The titular ""creature"" does not show up until very late in the film and is rather underwhelming when it eventually rears its ugly head. The human Caterpillar on the other hand was chillingly cruel. What saves this film is its sheer vulgarity and reliance on shock factor. A brutally graphic castration, a scolding water boarding session, a kidney rape and the amount of blood shed are sadistically entertaining. Never holding back, the gore and shock comes from all angles and, although somewhat corny, always made me squirm and laugh all at the same time.
In short, if you go into this film knowing it is going to be a poorly written, poorly acted, blood orgy and you are just along for the ride, you will enjoy this 100 minute mess of a movie."

",0.0,0.4867,2020-03-16 00:00:00,2,"A mad prison warder (Dieter Laser) is talked into creating a huge human centipede by his twisted accountant (Laurence R Harvey). Both of these characters are truly awful, and both of them are played by truly awful actors, I found them to be near unwatchable. The temptation to hit the ffwd button was great. The first movie was incredibly twisted and unoriginal, yet very light on gore. With part 3 Tom Six goes for comedy and gore, but jokes about such things as female circumscim aren't very funny. The film clocks in a around 100 minutes but there's no centipede until the last 10. This film is awful, the reasons why I'm scoring it 2 and not 1 out of 10 is that there is some good gore, plus it has Bree Olson and Eric Roberts in the cast (I bet he keeps quiet about this one!)
I hope this is the Final Sequence. Abysmal."
" I was begging for it to end!!!
",0.0,-0.9964,2020-03-15 00:00:00,1,"For years I avoided seeing the other 2 films in this now trilogy. I read about how horrible they were especially the second one. I finally got around to seeing them. Even though I find them repugnant films, they had a certain audacity and a level of super B movie atmosphere. They were certainly original. Human Centipede 3 makes the other 2 films look like masterpieces.Human Centipede 3 is probably the worst 100 minutes I have spent watching a film in a very long time. This film's tone is more satirical. But it is not sharp or funny to make it interesting let alone disturbing. I had felt with the 1st 2 films that Tom Six was just a filmmaker out to shock and disgust his audience. And he did, but he did show some talent for suspense and black comedy. Human Centipede 3 is such a terrible, boring, repugnant film that any notoriety of the others.The story of this one takes place in the US in a Texas prison. A warden played by Dieter Laser named Bill Boss. Yes, he played the maniacal but funny Dr. Heiter in the first film. That performance was really over the top but effective, memorable. This performance is even more over the top but absolutely horrific. He plays Bill Boss as a crazy, cruel warden but for laughs. I didn't laugh once. Also, Lawrence Harvey who played Martin in the second one is back as Dwight Butler, assistant to the warden. Again, his performance in the second film was really disturbing and weird. He had no dialogue but it was effective. Here he is also going for comedy here even rocking a Hitler mustache. Just terrible. The whole film is about how cruel the warden is to the prisoners. We see all sorts of torture and violence even before the human centipede is seen. It is not shocking, it's just a filmmaker having nothing else to do but daring you to watch, nothing more. Like in HC 2, the other films exist. Butler shows Bill the films and wants to get him to agree to attempt to make a human centipede using the prisoners. He resists at first, but in the end he agrees. We don't see the centipede until the last 20 minutes of the film and it is just anti climactic. Of course it is gross and violent seeing it being put together but what came before was so annoying and slow that it didn't really matter. Tom Six even appears as himself and is so bad that he makes Quentin Tarantino look like Robert De Niro. I get that he thinks that this self awareness is clever but it just added runtime to a film that was already a chore to get through.I think Tom Six made the other 2 trying to dare the audience to look at how far he would go to disgust them.i think this film was Six daring the audience to sit through a completely aweful film for 80 minutes and then tack on the human centipede because that is the title of the film. I didn't see any of these films in a theater. If I would have paid a cent to see Human Centipede 3 I would have felt totally robbed.Just Aweful.Grade: F"

" The Worst Sequel Ever Made
",-0.6249,-0.996,2019-09-08 00:00:00,1,"The first one sucked, the second one laughably sucked, and this third film REALLY REALLY sucked. This is without a doubt the worst sequel I have ever seen, and next to A Serbian Film, it is the second worst movie I have ever seen. Why did I watch it? I thought it would of AT LEAST improved over the first two films, but I THOUGHT WRONG...This horrendous sequel is about Dieter Laser, who played Dr. Heiter from the first film, and Laurence R. Harvey, who played Martin from the second film, playing two people that work at a huge prison. Heiter plays a despicable man, named Bill, and Harvey plays his assistant, Dwight. They both watch the first two Human Centipedes and get an idea. They decide to punish 500 prisoners by making them into a mega human centipede.The plot of this film is basically just a rehash of the second film. A guy watches the previous movie, and makes his own human centipede. Only here, it was done a LOT worse...Similar to A Serbian Film, the graphic moments are done in such a torture style way, and are so stupid and idiotic to watch. Both of these films have moments that will literally make you sick to your stomach and be scarred for life. The Saw fanchise isn't like that. Those films, again, are graphic and nasty, but done in an interesting and clever way. Not over the top and redundant like these pure trash films.The acting was also really really bad. Dieter Laser was worse in this film than he was in the first because of his character being so annoyingly stupid and perverted, and Laurence R. Harvey really had nothing to do.It's also huge shame good actors like Tiny Lister Jr. and Eric Roberts had to be in this abomination. They had nothing really to do either, and should of just said no to joining this crap.The only positive I can say about this film is it is awesome that this is the FINAL of the terrible Human Centipede franchise. I'm glad that the director, Tom Six, came to the decision that these films are hated a lot, so he decided to end it off with this film.But that is not saying much. The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence is PURE AND UTTER CRAP. For the sake of your sanity, avoid it at all costs!"

Now if those jokes make you laugh, you might be onto something. Unfortunately even in being ""funny"", this misses out on character traits. Why would the boss act like he doesn't like Human Centipede when he is exactly the same character like the one we are seeing in the movies? So while this is a movie within a movie within a movie - it is rather juvenille than clever.The director is a funny bloke and Dieter Laser is channeling him or his reactions to critics of his movies. Whatever the case, he relishes in everything thrown in his way, so me rating this 1/10 makes him happier than if I had gone 4 or 5. You're welcome Mr. Six! A nod to another critic (Ebert with a non score for the first Centipede, not the only movie that did not receive a rating by the way) is also part of the movie.So again, you may find certain things funny (and he is inventive, if rather explicit and vile), but overall this never really does anything other than try to provoke the strongest possible reaction (laughing out loud or feeling the puke running through your veins). The casting is quite nicely - with quite a few familiar faces"

" Could Dieter Laser be the worst actor in history? Perhaps...but his performance as the Warden is clearly the worst performance I've seen in years!
",-0.7777,-0.9951,2019-05-22 00:00:00,1,"I have an unusual hobby. I like to occasionally watch horrible films, as I find many of them unintentionally funny. Because of this passion, I have seen every movie in Harry Medved's ""The 50 Worst Movies"" and nearly all of IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. However, of all these bad films, one I simply could not bring myself to finish was ""The Human Centipede II"" as I found it so overwhelmingly disgusting, stupid and awful that I simply couldn't finish the job. This made my watching ""The Human Centipede III"" something I really did NOT look forward to doing! Should I have paid more attention to my brain and simply refused to see this third film? To put it bluntly...yes.When the film begins, you can't help but marvel at Dieter Laser as he plays the crazy Warden. I couldn't believe how bad an actor he was and what a horrible performance he could give as this very, very stupid character. Warden Boss is like a cartoon character....so evil he's utterly ridiculous. He overacts constantly and is so dumb and awful you just need to see and hear him to believe it!
Additionally, his heavy German accent simply made it sound as if he'd JUST learned English a few minutes before attempting this role! Is he completely to blame? No...the writer and director must own some of this as well, though I strongly suspect they were penguins as I cannot imagine a person directing or writing THIS poorly. His character is 100% sadism and 100% stupid....to the point where he becomes tedious....and dumber than Tor Johnson in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""!Overall, this movie was SLIGHTLY less disgusting than the prior film but the utter stupidity of the script and Laser put it in a class all by itself. I would clearly place this in a list NOT of the worst 100...but worst dozen films ever made. It' THAT bad...that pointless...that offensive...and that amateurish. A truly awful pile of dog vomit of a film...with a loud, brash, obnoxious no-talent leading it all in the form of Warden Boss!"

Just look at the movie. You see, in a few countries, the ban is forbidden (the countries that have freedom of expression), and I think it's right and you should not be allowed to play the whole world and be treated with the film's agents.
I read somewhere that movie director Tom Cutx is almost the day he did not receive email, call, or message of death to people, and was happy about this and said that then, it's obvious that the movie has hit so much that you want to kill me!
I've been horrified for horror genre films, and I've seen many of the films in this genre, and when I hear or read that, you can not see the movie as horrible as I can, but I really suggest that if one does not see this movie, I say, I'm sorry to see this movie, really a dirty and anti-human, trust me and do not see it.
I know, unfortunately, when you say that you do not watch the movie, or do not do it, you can see the worse person, but in this case, I'm sure after seeing the film I was talking about you saying that I would listen to it ...
I saw 2 parts and I did not see 3 and I would not see.
If you see I took the time and I wrote this whole text for this, maybe even 1 person would not have bitter experience with my words. It's okay, a brief summary of the film, for why I say I should not see the movie:
The name of the thirty-sixth human film in which one human scientist hurts and savagely shoots it! Yes sweetie !!!!!! That's the name of the movie is a thousand pence! So that the first person is the first person in the mouth and the second hip in the third person's mouth and ... And when the first person eats, the feces leave the last person, for example, the 15th! And ugly scenes ...Horror genre films with supernatural themes, Slasher and ...

Before that, several unconnected gory scenes are presented, just to show how sadistic the protagonist is.Unlike the first two films, this one has a comedic touch added, like the appearance of its director, Tom Six, as a character of himself. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in either direction: it's not thrilling, suspenseful or creepy, neither is it funny or entertaining.The film drags so much that, at a certain point (around 59min of running), after the prisoners are forced to watch ""The Human Centipede"" films, the character of Akihiro Kitamura (Inmate 333) stands and says, ""this trash occupies a world where the stars don't shine."" It comes out of nowhere that I laughed aloud! I was really not expecting that. Unfortunately, the joke only works because what comes before is too boring (if you fast forward to the joke, it won't have the same impact, I'm pretty sure). Almost one hour of build-up for a single joke is just too much.After that, the film goes back to dragging, until it ends, finally showing the human centipede (plus, a human caterpillar, made of prisoners whose limbs had been removed). All main characters, except the protagonist, die (well, the secretary is joined by accident to the centipede, so, well...)Is it worth watching? Definitely not. Downloading for free and watching fast forwarding is not a good option, as much of the impact of the film is lost (and the only joke). This really belongs to a place without stars..."

Also the film is orange because desert and Tom Six basically makes the actors say how great he is. So yeah I was right to think this would be the worst of the bunch.
I love how the governor only asks what is this instead of reacting to the situation at all. I mean he does get sick a little later but he's okay with it most of the time which is just weird. He just doesn't express how bad it is at all which is just terrible. but then oh no a crappy twist he is okay with it and he thinks he can become president.
I have a weird feeling that Tom Six will make a few films then make a human millipede picture cause why not I guess. Idk if this is The worst trilogy ever or not but its certainly up there."

" May this series now be laid to rest on the cinematic dung-pile
",0.0,-0.9922,2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,"When The Human Centipede was released back in 2009, it became an instant talking point with both gore-hounds giddy at the prospect of such a repugnant idea actually making its way onto our screens, and those concerned with the idea of cinema reaching the very bottom of the barrel for the last dregs of bad taste. Of course, the result was nowhere near as horrific as many had thought. While it may have featured a scene of characters passing faeces directly from bottom to mouth, the whole thing was rather amusing, if ineptly made. Director Tom Six was keen to ensure that the hype wouldn't die down for the sequel, and did so by creating one of the vilest and most humourless shockers in horror history, and undoubtedly one of worst excuses for a movie ever made. It's a relief that humour has found its way back for part three, as is the presence of the word 'final' in its title. But that's where the positives end, as this is yet another button-pushing, attention-seeking vanity-project for Six.Psychopathic prison warden Bill Boss (Dieter Laser) rules over his inmates with an iron fist, punishing those that step out of line by breaking bones, removing testicles, and waterboarding with boiling water. With the violence spinning out of control, Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) pays Boss a visit, informing the maniac that if he doesn't get a hold on things soon he will be fired and replaced. Having seen his brutal methods fail to bring the prisoners under control, Boss finally listens to his diminutive accountant Butler (Laurence R. Harvey) and his problem-solving idea. Armed with DVDs of The Human Centipede 1 and 2, Butler's scheme is to force the inmates to live out their sentences arse-to-mouth with their fellow incarcerates in one long, horrifying... well, you get the idea. With disgraced, struck-off prison doctor Jones (Clayton Rohner) on board in the hope of keeping his job, Boss and Butler even bring in Tom Six himself to discuss whether or not the director's claim of the procedure being 100% medically accurate is in fact correct.It was admittedly an interesting move to make The Human Centipede 2 about a disturbed individual's reaction to seeing the first movie, but performing the same trick again simply reeks of narcissism, especially considering Six's decision to place himself within the narrative. While the second entry aimed to simply upset and disgust its audience with no trace of nuance, part three is all about the humour. Although rather than laughing, you'll be checking the running time to see how much you have left to endure. To Six, comedy is all about shouting, and Laser screams, rants and swears for the 100 minutes, stopping occasionally to munch on some dried clitorises imported from Africa or force his assistant Daisy (porn actress Bree Olson) to perform oral sex on him. Anyone voluntarily watching this film are here for one reason - to see the human centipede. It appears around the 85 minute mark, so there's a lot of arm-waving and general unpleasantness to get through before the big pay-off, which only appears on screen for about 5 minutes. I never thought I'd complain about the lack of poor souls being monstrously stitched together to form one grotesque digestive system, but that's The Human Centipede for you. Hopefully this series can now be laid to rest on the cinematic dung-pile."

In this film there is flat out racism from the lead character including racial slurs and attacks against prisoners. As well as this, when there is a prison riot , a black man is seen punching a woman. The lead character is loud obnoxious and racist to the point it seems as if the 4 chan neo nazi edge lords posts on the internet seem like Disney. This doesn't get any better as the film progresses and the ending is just racism again. Of course this guy wins. Imagine viewing this film through the eyes of the alt right neo nazi movement, they would be cheering him on and laughing. The character is also heavily misogynistic, even raping a woman as she's in comatose after being beaten up. There are no other attempts to flesh out his character, no biting satire. Just a nazi rambling and doing offensive stuff for the sake of it. It's like a glorification of it. Whatever subtext that pretends to be about American justice systems falls flat as it's not explored enough and the racism seems by the numbers for Hollywood Institutional racism. In the same way that the second film made mental health and abuse victims look like psychos, (another Hollywood trope,) this film is nothing more than glorifying racist attacks and neo nazi thoughts. In a very loud and obnoxious way."
" Every bit as bad as the previous two
",-0.5423,-0.9136,2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"The third and thankfully final instalment of this execrable film trilogy, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE) is every bit as crass and stupid as its predecessors. This time around the setting is a prison run by a crazed warden who decides to build the biggest human centipede in history. This only takes up a small part of the running time, while the rest of the narrative is padded out with endless repetition: blood vessel-bursting overacting, crude gags, sex, a porn actress (Bree Olsen) masquerading as a proper actress, gore, and gross-out behaviour. It's ridiculously poor, childishly unfunny, and only worth watching for the sado-masochists among us."

" No more centipedes!
",-0.3595,-0.9929,2017-12-04 00:00:00,1,"I think this is the first time I write a review about a movie that I have not been able to watch until the end. I firmly believe, after seeing this film, that Tom Six should have some serious mental problem, and I am very sorry because I have never had anything against him personally. I sincerely hope that he will stop working at the movies and be very happy in any other profession.If ""Human Centipede"" and the sequel that was inexplicably made afterwards were very bad movies, this movie set the record. Again, there is no real script here but a context and a cause. The context is the prison world and the cause is the madness and insanity of the guards and prison director who decide to build the ""centipede"" with hundreds of prisoners whom they think should be punished more severely. The mistakes continue, that ""medically accurate"" crap is no longer convincing and is clearly being used with sarcasm and the characters are deeply void.Repeating what I wrote for the second movie, I've never been a fan of gore movies, despite being an admirer of horror movies. Blood and fluids do not scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. If I tried watching this movie it was just to be aware of the extent of the crap I already knew he had. I really hope it's the end of the centipedes."
" The Human Centipede III : Well it was certainly memorable
",0.5423,0.619,2017-11-04 00:00:00,3,"The first Human Centipede movie had a certain novelty factor about it. It was meant to shock and it succeeded, thus making it somewhat watchable.The second was a disgusting mess with no redeeming features and would likely be in my bottom 100 movies ever made.This, is an odd creature.So the antagonists from both previous movies return, but they both play different characters! In the second movie the first movie was made out to be exactly that, just a movie. In this one both the first and second are supposed to have been movies.Still with me?Adding an element of humor this third part is undeniably memorable but not for the right reasons. It aims to shock once again and pulls out all the stops in doing so.Credit where credit is due, the lead takes the character and makes it his own and saves the film (To an extent). The Human Centipede III is disgusting, and there is barely a story but it has moments that are very hard to get off your mind so it at least succeeds there.Not for the faint.The Good:Dieter Laser certainly makes for an interesting character with Billy BossThe Bad:Shock for the sake of shockNo real storyline"
" just bad...
",0.0,-0.9691,2017-10-26 00:00:00,1,"Usually I think people are harsh on horror movies but anything greater than a 1 star is generous. The movie is 90% yelling for no given reason, the actors are awful. The movie borderlines on parody but tries to be serious at times, both aspects fall completely flat. At least the other two films were somewhat set in reality, this one is comical to the point where the ""Governor"" and also the creator of the series both make cameos and the Governor is perfectly cool at the end with the human centipede and THE END. Literally as soon as the centipede is made the movie is over, anticlimactic isn't the word. Sometimes horror movies are so bad it's good but this is so bad it's just really bad. Skip this movie at all costs. This movie is just plain stupid"
" Prisoners
",-0.5106,0.6757,2017-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Whereas the first 'Human Centipede' was mostly just about pushing boundaries, the second chapter was delightfully self-referential, focused on a character inspired to create his own centipede after watching the first movie. With 'The Human Centipede 3', writer- director Tom Six takes this self-referential angle even further, focusing on prison staff inspired by the first two movies who invite Tom Six to supervise their construction of a real prisoner human centipede. Dieter Laser - who was the lead actor in Part 1 - is the prison warden and has several amusing lines as he declares that the first two 'Centipede' films ""stink"" and calls Six ""an infatuated toddler"". Six's cameo is a lot of fun too; same goes for his choice to retain Laurence R. Harvey playing a totally different character. Six trips up though by giving Laser free reign to go as over-the-top as he likes as the warden, driven insane by heat. It is a distracting exaggerated performance and one that unjustly takes up most of the screen time, with the construction of Laser's centipede left to the final quarter of the movie. In short, those who liked the self-referential elements of Part 2 will still find a lot to like here, but those in it for the shocks and graphic imagery may be disappointed. And for those who did not like either aspect of the second film, what are you doing reading this review?"
" By far the worse movie I have ever seen
",-0.4767,0.8294,2017-08-15 00:00:00,1,"Why oh why people spent time, effort, energy and money to make this movie is beyond me. I enjoyed the two first movies but seriously people, quit while you're ahead. This is definitely 102 minutes of my life I will never get back and I had to apologize for having friends over to watch it with me. And yes, it is that bad. I'd prefer having watched paint dry."
" This movie was very unnecessary...
",0.0,-0.9881,2017-07-18 00:00:00,3,"I must admit that I had some great reservations about sitting down to watch ""The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence"", especially since the first movie was mediocre and the second movie was even less entertaining than the first movie. So the third - and hopefully last - installment in the franchise didn't exactly have the cards dealt to it in its favor.The cast in ""The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence"" was of somewhat a mixed handful. It was so bizarre to see cast from the first two movies in the franchise return to the movie, but in different roles. That just made for some very confusing associations. And Dieter Laser had a very peculiar way of acting and performing which seems comical and so out of tune, which added a distracting element to the atmosphere of the movie. Much of the time it was like watching a spoiled child trying to lash out in frustration and anger. Actually, it was very disruptive to the rest of the movie, because it was hard to take him serious in the movie. And just how they got the likes of Eric Roberts and Robert LaSardo to show up in a movie such as this was just beyond me.At least the dialogue was very much in tune with the rest of the movie, being every bit as forced, ridiculous and weird. Most of it didn't really make much sense, and it didn't really help that most of it was delivered by a whacked out Dieter Laser. It should be said that there is some pretty hefty racial slurs, profane language and such being used in this movie, so do take that into consideration if you are easily offended by such foul language.The characters were entirely weird and offbeat, especially most of the inmates in the prison. I mean, their behavior was just so strange that it would happen only in the movies.There are some very graphic stuff taking place in the movie, and that might be upsetting to some viewers. But then again, going into watching a movie such as this, then you know what you are getting yourself into, of course. I am a seasoned horror and gore veteran, but even I was finding myself cringing at some of the scenes portrayed in this movie.Now, I don't really understand the idea or concept of putting the actual DVDs of the former two movies into this third movie. Sure, I get it that it was to present the idea that the events in this movie was based on the events taking place in those movies. But come on, that was just unfathomably cheesy, even for this franchise.It was clear already in the second movie that director and writer Tom Six should have stopped with the completion of the first movie, because it has been a steady decline down a steep hill since then. And ""The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence"" didn't prove to improve on the franchise in any particular way.This 2015 third installment into ""The Human Centipede"" franchise had a few moments of cringe-worthy visuals, but it was hardly a movie that stood apart from the previous two, and it didn't bring much of anything new to the franchise.I have seen it now, and color me unimpressed."

" I don't even know
",0.0,-0.95,2017-04-11 00:00:00,1,If I could give this movie a negative infinity rating I would because it was that terrible. The main character of the film screamed every single line as slowly as he possibly could and would lose his accent between every other word. This movie is by far the worst film I have ever seen and is not even close to the level of any other movie. There is no redeeming quality to watching this movie and I would highly recommend avoid watching it at all costs.
" Just wasted 1,5 hour of my life
",-0.4939,-0.8778,2017-03-28 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately for me, I have not seen the first two movies. Therefore,I had no idea what this movie would be like. Nonetheless I was somewhat prepared (thanks to the title and the poster) for many gory disgusting scenes.Little did I know; this movie made me feel sick and bored at the same time. There was no plot whatsoever, the actors' roles were simply frustrating, and the only feeling that emerged at the end of the movie was anger (1,5 hours of my life wasted) and disgust (contemplating how twisted a man's mind can be depicting such ""beautiful"" ideas)..I searched for symbolic scenes and hidden meanings, through cheeky humour and absurdity, but unfortunately I was incapable of finding any.The only thing I managed to gain from this movie, was that I just stretched my patience's limits.."
" A ""not for everyone"" funny comedy horror
",-0.5583,-0.9631,2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I think the reason this movie has such a bad rating is that some people don't get that this is a comedy horror, if you try to watch it seriously or if you expect something like the first two movies then yeah you're probably not gonna enjoy yourself, but then again it's not how it is meant to be watched. Comedy horrors are extremely hard to get right because it combines the most difficult genres to get right, not everybody laughs at the same things and not everybody is scared of the same things. This movie relies on shock humor and extremely exaggerated acting. I find Dieter Laser as Bill Boss hilarious and same goes for Laurence R Harvey as Dwight, they're a very funny duo and very memorable characters. But then again, if screaming profanities and saying the word ""cock"" every two seconds isn't your humor and ball cutting scenes aren't your type of horror then you're going to hate this movie.I'm giving it a 10 while acknowledging that this movie isn't for everyone, but that doesn't make it a bad movie that just makes it a controversial movie. You might love it, you might hate it, there's no in between and I think Tom Six doesn't want an in between, he wants strong reactions and that's exactly what he gets with each of his movie. So bravo Tom Six."
