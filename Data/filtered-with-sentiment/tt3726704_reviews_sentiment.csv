" The Milgram Experiment
",0.0,0.8823,2021-02-10 00:00:00,4,"I remember studying and being terribly fascinated with this experiment in college. This, coupled with the Stanford Prison Experiment created a fairly distressing view of human behavior that, in some ways, I think we spent decades trying to recover from or outright bury. Two experiments that ostensibly proved that, given the right setting, we're all basically monsters. To then see that a film was made about the experiment immediately had my attention. After watching it, I really appreciate how it focused more on the lives surrounding the study, the damage that was caused both to the subjects and the careers and reputations of those involved.Problem is... The methodology used here just feels so awkward and clunky. It regularly breaks into periods of our lead looking to the camera to explain things in unnecessary narration and exposition.It happens constantly, like regular introductions to each new scene in the movie and it annoyed the bejesus out of me. It just feels lazy and hits on one of my biggest pet peeves. Show, don't tell. There are plenty of biopics that manage to explore their subject without needing to endlessly narrate everything and spell everything out to the audience. If this could've had a little more certainty and craft then it could have been something much much more.Experimenter is a story of a really fascinating discovery in out history, one that I absolutely think people should know about but it just doesn't have the wherewithal to take that subject matter and turn it into a successful narrative. Anyone interested in the topic would really be better served just looking it up and digging into it rather than bothering with this movie."
" Why *Don't* I Have a Choice?
",0.0,0.9612,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"This film is a dramatization of the life of Stanley Milgram, a sociologist and psychologist famous for his work in obedience to authority. The film starts with Milgram's experiment in which teacher subjects are led to believe they are delivering electric shocks, increasing in intensity from uncomfortable to painful, to student subjects when they answer questions incorrectly. Milgram is surprised to find that many teachers across the board (e.g., male and female, young and old, various races) continue to the highest shock setting when urged to by a scientist: ""Why,"" he asks, ""is defiance the anomaly and not the norm?"" This question leads Milgram through Yale and Harvard and CUNY, leading to his theory on the ""agentic state,"" in which ""the individual yields to authority, and in so doing becomes alienated from his own actions.""I don't remember how I found out about the movie, but the experiment I learned, as many may have, from an intro course in psychology. Not only does the film provide a riveting and engrossing portrayal of his most famous study but it also delves into the life and philosophy of its inventor. As the study gains popularity, the world begins to question the study's ethics because the tactics Milgram used on his subjects to elicit their genuine reactions come across as deceptive. This in turn leads to a tragicomic third act in which Milgram, scorned by the public for how he conducted his study and having sold its story to television, observes that his life has become like a bad movie.Nevertheless, the serious scientific and deep existential inquiries that permeate Milgram's life and the film are presented very well! The film provides excellent summaries of not just Milgram's other studies -- for example his Small World experiment, where a subject sends a package to someone they may not know via someone they do know -- but also Solomon Asch's conformity experiment, in which subjects set aside their own judgment about an answer they know to be wrong when their peers unanimously agree about it.My review's title comes from a powerful scene, my favorite. After many subjects go to the highest shock setting, one refuses. Drawing from his experience working with electricity, the dissenter reaches a point where he does not wish to continue. When told he has no choice but to do so, he demands to know why. Dissatisfied with the answer, in a remarkable example of conscience and individualism, he walks out of the experiment. (After each experiment, Milgram hosts a debriefing in which subjects are told that there were no shocks and the student was only acting, and are asked about how that makes them feel. A part of me wonders how the dissenter might have reacted.)Cinematically and philosophically the film is compelling and unique to me. The cinematographic choices like breaking the fourth wall, unusual visual devices like having elephants wander hallways, and watching Milgram watch the experiment give the film a surreal ""play within a play"" feel. Kierkegaard, a philosopher whose works I've only recently getting into, has quotes sprinkled throughout the film, especially ""Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards."" A very introspective and thought-provoking film!"
" You will believe this movie is better than it is
",0.4404,0.328,2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Stanley Milgram. Oh boy. Gotta say I am a big fan and I am fascinated by his work along with Phillip Zimbardo. To see his life play out was interesting to say the least, having a solid foundation for many of his experiments. If anything, watching this movie after the year we just had makes it all the more prescient.Where to begin. The Obedience Study is essentially the foundation of all modern movements. When you lose personal autonomy within a movement, do you still maintain your agency? While I work a job that requires me to tell people to wear masks, how much am I giving up for the sake of a faceless entity which has sucked much of my personality dry? If anything, living compartmentalized lives makes Milgram's assessments more dangerous and real. So many people become zombies to streaming services and shows, and so many people become sucked in to wayward political movements. If anything, people are afraid to be alone and standing against the tide. It's a tough plain to find yourself on, and hence why such people lose themselves so readily.I love this movie. It wants me to believe it is a much better movie than it is but the way it presents itself is so intriguing. It uses an actual elephant! I give this film a solid 7.5 out of 10, mainly because it pushes the idea that the Obedience to Authority will be the central feature to the story but it is something of a quick study on Milgram himself. I wish they had gone more into him rather than the experiments, but either way, this is still an engrossing movie to watch. The battle of philosophers and social scientists will argue forever about how people assimilate into a groupthink, but Milgram put it on paper and showed the world that it is much more complex than that."
" Excellent, underrated film.
",0.5719,0.9871,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,"This is technically not a perfect film but it is very interesting if you're the kind who enjoys learning something new in a creative way and the subject matter is provocative. This is more of a biographical film that covers the remarkable research of a man who was before his time. Some things work some don't work as well but overall it kept interest throughout.Regardless if you don't care for some style choices (such as breaking the fourth wall) it's mostly quite good. I'm not sure if the somewhat blandish, cool demeanor of our main character (Sarsgaard) was meant to be a reflection of what he was actually like and possibly what also caused him to be somewhat misunderstood.This is an interesting film if you understand what it is before viewing."
" Very interesting film
",0.4576,0.9835,2020-09-02 00:00:00,8,"1961. Social psychologist Stanley Milgram (well played with compelling restraint by Peter Sarsgaard) conducts a controversial series of radical behavioral experiments that test the average person's natural capacity to be completely obedient to authority.Writer/director Michael Almereyda offers a highly complex, intelligent, and oftentimes provocative exploration of how a majority of people are rigidly conditioned to staunchly adhere to and simply obey authority as well as provides an equally fascinating examination of the questionable ethical ramifications of the way Milgram did his experiments. Moreover, Almereyda employs a bold experimental approach that includes frequent breaking of the fourth wall by Milgram (he talks right to viewers about the meaningful findings of his experiments and their insights into human nature), a couple instances of a literal elephant in a room, and blatant use of fake backgrounds as a means of commenting on both the contrived and staged nature of Milgram's experiments and the intrinsic artificiality of the cinematic medium. Winona Ryder lends sturdy support as Milgram's perky wife Alexandra, Jim Gaffigan contributes an amusing turn as jovial test subject James McDonough, and there are nice cameos by such familiar folks as Anthony Edwards, Taryn Manning, Anton Yelchin, and John Leguizamo as participants in the experiment. Recommended viewing for adventurous viewers looking for something different and challenging."
" A psychologist's life leaves a mark on many generations after
",0.0,0.9186,2020-03-10 00:00:00,7,"I have heard about this experiment many times over the years...I even heard about it a few days ago on a podcast before seeing this movie. The movie goes through all of the work of Stanley Milgram along with all of his ups and downs in his career. This was an interesting movie and I liked how Peter Scarsgaard narrated as he went along. It was good to see Winona Ryder again. The acting was very good and it was interesting to see the backstory that went along with all of these experiments that we've heard about in school and elsewhere.
You do need some patience to get through the movie - psychological experiments can be tedious on film and in real life."

" Yes Virginia, That Really is an Elephant in the Room!
",0.4574,0.7308,2019-12-26 00:00:00,5,"For those with an interest in Stanley Milgram's work, or indeed the man himself, I'm sure they'll find something to hang a hook on, in this quasi-documentary, rather than historical biopic. For me, I found Michael Almeredya's work about as enticing as a tarted up documentary, focusing more on his work and social responses, rather than the man himself.I've little doubt the history police will have nothing to complain about with Experimenter in terms of its historical veracity. Much of the movie is just a series of vignettes justifying the movie's title. We literally are delivered experiment after experiment, with the various episodes often connected by a fourth wall breaking Peter Saarsgard, playing the good professor and explaining in great detail the rationale behind each experiment. It becomes pretty tedious quite quickly and ironically leaves little room for much of an examination of the man and his life outside his work. Winona Ryder despite having generous screen time as Milgram's wife Sasha, makes little impact in the narrative, due to the rigid docu/drama style employed by Almereyda. She's more like a stage prop used every so often to elaborate a point made by talking head Saarsgard.The drama quotient does increase marginally in the second half of the film, when we do get some idea of the criticism Milgram receives from some of his peers and social commentators, regarding the ethical standards of some of his experiments. But this thread is never really allowed to develop, as we jump to a new experiment and/or new time period. And speaking of distracting devices that dilute dramatic content, can I just say to whoever was responsible for that ridiculous beard that Saarsgard wore in the last third of the film, ""You had to be kidding""."
" FORCED RATING

I loved the old school stylised sets and direction.Saarsgad and Ryder are excellent. Low key but powerful.The neat ending will bring an amused smile.Really worth the watch."
" very accurate on human psychology
",0.0,-0.8715,2019-11-15 00:00:00,8,"This story discusses perhaps the most important issue in human behavior, i.e. SUBMISSION.
It is this characteristic in our human psyche that causes most of our grave problems especially wars.
And so it's understandable why such a research or a movie shall irritate and anger many people,
It touches and uncovers the lowest in human nature.
The herd nature, the slave nature, and the glorifying of power,
The movie is a good work but it could have had a harsher tone."
" An uncomfortable and self revealing film
",-0.3818,-0.9771,2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I have always wondered how other people can act the way they do, even when it seems to go against their core beliefs. This historical study and film helped me to question how I might betray my own strong beliefs, if certain conditions were present. How could otherwise sentient, empathetic human beings carry out the grunt work of the Holocaust, racism, or school bullying?.I remember twice involving myself in school bullying, in primary school. (When I was about 10yrs old). The target person seemed like a bad guy, but was new to the school, had not fit in, and had been bullied. I think I got caught up in the crowd mentality, and although I only buried him verbally, perhaps at that age it never occurred to me to simply talk to him. Later I felt disgusted and confused by my behaviour, and just as confused by the crowd baying me on.This is the only time during my life where I feel I have been purposely destructive to another human being, even if I think they deserve it. I mean really, what's the point. Among other things the film indicates, this sort of crowd mentality is part of the human psyche, but offers the possibility that if understood and explored honestly, perhaps can be countered.We for some time now have lived in a global economy. Whilst our actions affect the earth, and all of us humans that share it, I think we are socially behind the technological advances, and perhaps the impact that we are having on the global environment. Are we being blindly obedient?. As a person of 53 years old, I would say that the younger generations seem to be more in touch with challenging the actions that confront these ideas, which is comforting.Anyway.... A thought provoking movie, about ideas that are still relevant..... I'm off the soap box."
" Simple yet effective
",0.4767,0.9806,2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,"In 1961 Dr Stanley Milgram performed a series of experiments that revolutionised our understanding of human behaviour, particularly with regard to obedience. It went a long way to explaining how the Nazis managed to carry out the Holocaust and explaining other historic events. This is the story of Dr Milgram, this famous experiment and his other work.A simple yet effective telling of one of the great breakthroughs in sociology / psychology. Is quite a dry telling, with fairly low production values, but it largely works. Quite interesting, especially as you hear about the results of the main experiment plus some of the other experiments Professor Milgram performed.As mentioned, it is quite dry though, so can feel a bit dull at times. We don't learn much about Milgram himself, even though much of his life is shown. His family life seems more like padding than anything else (even if his wife is played by the wonderful Winona Ryder).Solid enough performance by Peter Sarsgaard in the lead role. Good supporting cast. Taryn Manning does look out of place though, playing a 1960s housewife. Maybe it is because I kept thinking of her as Pennsatucky in Orange is the New Black!"
" An intelligently crafted exhortation to be a better human
",0.7096,0.5806,2019-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Such an interesting depiction of a fascinating, sobering reality regarding human behavior. I'm sure there are all kinds of reasons why Experimenter has not rated better than it has so far: Some dislike the format, some are (apparently) thrown off by the symbolic use of recurring oddities, others find the casting somewhat awkward; etc. If you are deciding whether or not to watch this film, I definitely recommend watching it, but, please, watch with an open mind. However you may feel about the film's stylings, realize that it's purpose is to do much more than attempt to entertain. It reminds us all of the fact that there really are a lot of blind faith followers in our country, and in the world overall. That alone, in my opinion, makes this one a must see. Accepting & understanding the truth is how we begin to move forward, rather than just repeating the same, horrifying mistakes."
" my notes

" What is the film's real agenda?
",0.0,-0.1036,2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"The truth is always a better story.
1) When a participant hesitated in applying electric shocks, the actor playing the role of experimenter was meant to stick to a script of four escalating verbal ""prods"". In fact, he frequently improvised, inventing his own terms and means of persuasion. Gina Perry (author of Behind The Shock Machine) has said the experiment was more akin to an investigation of ""bullying and coercion"" than obedience.
2) A partial replication of the studies found that no participants actually gave in to the fourth and final prod, the only one that actually constituted a command. Analysis of Milgram's transcripts similarly suggested that the experimenter prompts that were most like a command were rarely obeyed. A modern analogue of Milgram's paradigm found that order-like prompts were ineffective compared with appeals to science, supporting the idea that people are not blindly obedient to authority but believe they are contributing to a worthy cause.
3) Milgram failed to fully debrief his participants immediately after they'd participated.
In an unpublished version of his paradigm, Milgram recruited pairs of people who knew each other to play the role of teacher and learner. In this case, disobedience rose to 85 per cent.
4) Many participants were sceptical about the reality of the supposed set-up. Restricting analysis to only those who truly believed the situation was real, disobedience rose to around 66 per cent.

" Different style
",0.0,0.1989,2018-12-09 00:00:00,8,"The most interesting part of this movie was the use of unusual rear-projection, like Hitchcock gone mad. It seemed right since it gave the movie an experimental quality, fitting the title. Director Almadeyla has an interesting eye.
Saarsgard, as usual, has a compelling presence. I liked the touch of having the lab-coated, obnoxious experimenter be obnoxious for real. One critique--why that strangely ill-fitting beard on Milgram?"
" Very interesting story

It was not meant to be a super original or fast-paced movie, so I don't see how the ""boring"" adjective is fitting. Its aim was to describe what he had done and how it was interpreted and its impact on society. So yes, I recommend it for whoever is interested in his theories."

" Fascinating Real-Life Story, Weirdly Told
",0.3182,0.9199,2017-11-22 00:00:00,4,"The Milgram obedience experiments are justly famous in the field of psychology, and an interesting movie could undoubtedly have been made about them, but this is not it.Peter Sarsgaard sleepwalks thru the Milgram role with almost no affect, and Winona Ryder is wasted as his devoted wife. Writer/Director Michael Almereyda seems more interested in cutesy cinematic tricks (like constantly breaking the 4th wall) than in telling a coherent story, and the viewer is often left wondering ""Who is this guy?"" and ""What just happened?"". I DID learn that Milgram was the researcher behind the original ""6 degrees of separation"" experiments as well, and it would've been interesting to spend a little more time on that story line instead of boring living- room conversations about academic tenure and publishing."
" Fell asleep
",0.0,-0.8718,2017-08-20 00:00:00,4,"I really can not describe the whole film as I fell asleep and lack the motivation to watch the part I missed. The problem with the film is it is neither a good documentary nor a good film, if it wishes to be an interesting film it needs to inject some pace or drama. The central character breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the audience, this increases as the film progresses to the point were it is nearly pure narration, the fake backgrounds simply break your involvement with the film. It is a shame as it covers so really interesting points as how far will people go if told to do so by authority, it opens up the debate on how could people conduct the atrocities in concentration camps? did the conductor of the experiment abuse the participates? the more I think about it this would have made a better documentary."
" An oddly adapted version of a very interesting point in the history of psychology
",0.4576,0.3128,2017-07-12 00:00:00,7,"First off, Dr. Milgram's work is a great subject for a film and left the door open for a million ways for this story to be told. The positive side: It's a well-cast rendition which covers the basic points in the man's life. For someone who has never read about his work, I think it's a great introduction. The performances are not bad, but I think as a result of a weak script, the action plays out in a very dry and unemotional way. Stylistic decisions (such as direct address of the audience by the title character in almost every scene) make it very hard to take this film seriously or to have any real response. Many moments in the film seem to be reenactments done as snippets of a bad documentary on Milgram, where others hit right on the dot.All in all they tried to cover too much material for one film and should have found something more specific to focus on. They style cinematography, direct address of camera, and moments of green-screened action on black and white backgrounds, make the film very hard to suspend disbelief. It was nice to see someone attempt a style outside the Hollywood formula, but sadly this one didn't choose the right methods of experimentation."
