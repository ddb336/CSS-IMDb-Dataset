" Excellent Story About Gamblers

I feel sorry for those who do. Excellent story with great acting, also very emotional and somewhat disturbing. Good reminder how dark life can really get if one chooses the wrong path consistently."
" Skip This Drivel, It Was A Snoozefest!
",0.0,-0.5767,2021-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Mississippi GrindThis movie just rambled on from one silly scene to the next. It seemed to have no narrative drive and any reason for showing us what we were seeing.Gambling is a bore and compulsive gamblers are losers looking for a quick win, that never comes.Why anyone thought there was material for a movie escapes me. This the perhaps worst Ryan Reynolds movie, but he has time to make another turkey!I give this 4/10 for being a moving screensaver!"
" Regular...
",0.0,0.9477,2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"I'm not sure, general speaking well, but I was a little bit like that, I liked the bizarre contrast, the game addict who ruined the marriage and lost his daughter's love, and the young, ambitious, handsome, lucky and vegan Ryan Reynolds... Trail sonorous, country sound... And an unexpected ending, even because what is expected for addicts is usually failure..."
" Starts good but heads to pointless by halftime
",0.2382,-0.509,2020-09-17 00:00:00,2,I thought it does a good job of showing gambling addiction but then It tends to drag into pointlessness. The first half of the movie you would think that there was some odd weird twist about to happen where Ryan Reynolds is not a human or some psychological dream is occurring because of his luck and difference to the main character Gerry but nope. So what was the point? What was the lesson? Was Reynolds character real? Frustrating.
" Just about works, but very dialogue heavy.
",0.0,0.8388,2020-05-26 00:00:00,6,"Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn work well together is this otherwise rather lightweight drama about two men who become friends after a series of failed attempts at success/relationships - you name it. Mendelsohn is ""Gerry"" - the older, gambling addict with Reynolds the younger ""Curtis"" who is just as addicted but maybe has just a bit more nouse... It's quite a fun adventure as they try to redress their failings from the past but the story doesn't really go anywhere fast. At times it is dark for the sake of it - and it can get just a little relentless after the fourth cycle of win/lose. That said, the two develop a plausible bond and the film is more about their relationship than anything else, so if you are prepared not to be blown away (or even sighed upon) then it's just about worth a watch..."

",0.4466,0.1557,2020-05-22 00:00:00,5,"Not quite sure what the point of it was, but as Ryan Reynolds character keeps saying 'It's all about the ride'.

" A great movie portraying the problems of Gambling in America
",0.34,0.9197,2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly good movie I haven't heard many people talk about. I love seeing the dynamic of these characters going across testing their luck around the country. I don't get anxious with many films but best believe you will get some anxiety from this movie.
" Buffalo chips, mostly
",0.0,-0.9848,2019-11-15 00:00:00,6,"This movie about gamblers is a character piece, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. The Ryan Reynolds character at first seems alien, too good to be true--fronting money and hanging out with a real degenerate gambler. His motivation is to ""do it for fun""...OK, so he's not an alien or supernatural being, but a weird guy who just wants some adventure. But his mercurial habit of going ""Machu Pichu"" (skedadlling) when the other guy is down on his luck, doesn't make quite much sense...IF he's in it for fun. And later in the movie he even lets the loser bet on a losing horse, while he bets on a winning one..why? This is never explained. The entire movie without Ryan Reynolds is a sad, pathetic portrayal of gambling addiction, and it's quite pedestrian. Ben Mendelsohn does a great job, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The Ryan Reynolds' character IS something we haven't seen before...but he disappoints, over and over. Half the time he just sits out of the games, and lets his loser friend tell him how he did afterwards...why?Ryan's character also seems to hook up with these women (how does he know them? Are they paid hookers? How does he get the money to pay for them?) It doesn't really make sense...THEN he lets his partner get beaten up in a restroom, even though he caused the fight. What?? Makes absolutely NO sense.And the whole subplot of the loser gambler trying to make it big so he can ""win"" his wife back, only for him to visit her and try and steal from her---is not new, either.I was very disappointed with the actual gambling scenes. Why do they always show the FACES of the gamblers, and not the actual game, the cards, the thrill? Even in the horse race, we (again) see the cliched gamblers getting all excited--we see horses, but we can't tell which one is theirs, or how close it is. I find it odd that in many movies, things are dumbed down so the viewer can access it, but with poker, we're all supposed to know that the Q river card means our main character is busted. We can't root or sweat with them, because the director chooses to focus on their faces. As a result, we can't empathize too much with their wins or losses.In the end, the Ryan Reynolds character flits back into the gambler's life, and they go on a spree for a 3rd time. Reynolds himself seems to be trying to get back to some woman, but we never see her. It's a dissatisfying, odd movie that never quite explains its own symbolism or anything. Rather episodic, cliche in many spots, and frustrating."
" For those fond of characters and conversation
",0.4404,0.9359,2019-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Mississippi GrindMississippi Grind works mostly due to its two lead actors.
Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn have a sublime chemistry that allow this slow burn tale of two gamblers on a road trip to captivate its audience.
Dialogue is punchy and engaging allowing deep character development of the two leads.
That along with exceptional performances by both leave us craving for more.
The film never over explains and allows the viewer to go on the journey with both Reynolds and Mendelsohn.
For those fond of character driven pieces rich with fascinating conversation then this movie is for you.
Those expecting a little more motion from their motion picture may find this yarn tedious.
I however fully enjoyed the company of these two characters and their exploits."
" You bet
",0.0,0.1406,2019-06-11 00:00:00,5,"Writer/Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck hit mainstream movie gold with Captain Marvel in 2019.Before then they got critical acclaim with Half Nelson. In Mississippi Grind they hark back to cinema of the 1970s. This could be Fat City with Jeff Bridges and Stacy Keach or Scarecrow with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman.This is a gambling road movie. Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) down on his luck meets the younger and charismatic Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) in a card game in Iowa. They strike up an easy friendship as they got for that big win as they through various grimy casinos in the south.Gerry and Curtis are complicated deadbeats. Gambling addicts who are unsure why they do what they do. Gerry is in debt and times reduced to steal from his ex-wife or lie about losing all his money. He has always been on a downward spiral unsure when he last had a winning streak. At least Curtis has more sense to know when to stop.Mississippi Grind has a rootsy blues soundtrack but it is too meandering, lifeless and a bit of a grind to watch despite the acting by the leads."
" Boring and awkwardly written
",-0.5574,-0.4569,2019-05-29 00:00:00,4,"I like the actors but there is no chemistry. I blame the awkward script and sloppy pacing.I am not a huge fan of the aesthetics of this movie in general either, it's all dive bars, second rate casinos, and the Southern United States. Everything is just so dead.It is a good portrayal of gambling addiction, and this movie does have its moments, but overall it is just not worth watching."
" Not quite all in
",0.0,0.8834,2019-05-18 00:00:00,6,"Sadly, Ryan Reynolds plays literally himself in this movie. He is a smooth talking lady's man who charms people with his good looks and wit. However, Ben Mendelsohn impressed me with his transformation into a degenerate gambler who lacks confidence. The tragic reality of a gambling addiction is perfectly presented here. Gerry is willing to do anything for money just to make one last bet. In the end, Curtis doesn't change. He is still a lady's man. But Gerry might change, although it is only hinted at, which gives me hope that addictions can be overcome. Mississippi Grind has its moments, and I would rewatch it in the future. It has potential to be a grower. But I don't think it will ever reach the cult classic status of Rounders in the poker community."
" I used to think Ryan Renolds suced!
",0.0,0.9921,2019-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Big time! But now as of late, I think I was wrong, perhaps I was jealous of his good loooks lol, I don' t know, but here enacting his character he did a fine job, moving through the scope of human emotions really well , great timing and he pulled off a great job!That being said, there was some fine writing here, his character is not only charming and forgiving but very exciting, so it lends to a very interesting plot line that sort of works itself out in the end despite his sidekick's depraved antics.But I have to say, this film, was very very well written, the life of someone that is engulfed completely in this disease , is very very frightful in its (Noun of tenuous anyone?) lol, but yes, this is a tough road to pic in life, one never knows if one has won enough to be fixed or lost enough, nor when they are going to pick back up where they left off and what? How far can you sink in this game before you are facing the edge of oblivion?Very cool, highly recommend it."
" Slow but watchable... Great acting!
",0.7871,0.819,2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"These two actors Reynolds and Mendelssohn are great actors. Reynolds playing the funny witty guy, as usual. And Mendelssohn playing the straight dramatic guy. Gambling movies are not very exciting anyway but this one is slow and dark. I understand why Captain Marvel is slow and dark at times, same writers/directors."
" Lacking in punch and originality. Many gambling addict movies have been made, this one just doesnt add anything. It is a rather downbeat, boring portrait of 2 gamblers.
",-0.3182,0.9465,2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"Many movies about gambling addicts have been made and this one is lacking in punch and originality. It starts out promising and I love these actors, but they have difficulty carrying this drama, which doesnt really become a drama by the way. It just slouches on and on, with the same story about gambling and losing, gambling some more, losing some more etc.It aint really funny or suspenseful either, so what is left is a rahter downbeat portrait of 2 gamblers with a ridiculous ending, which I dont want to spoil here. 6 stars would be just too kind of a rating, because in the end this movie bored the heck out of me and it wasnt true to life either with that ridiculous ending. So whatever effort there was taken to make this into a drama, that effort was completely in vain as well. Only 5 stars.Aint there any good? Well, if you like to watch a slowburning, downbeat gambling movie, this one is exactly that. Acting is ok as well. Really pretty good. It has a miraculously positive ending, which has no credibility at all, but viewers might like that positive end as well.My advice would be to skip ""Mississipi
Grind"" though and instead watch ""Rounders"" with Matt Damon, Edward Norton and John Malkovich. ""Rounders"" is a really suspenseful, riveting pokergame movie with terrific acting performances."
" No message in sight
",-0.296,0.8864,2019-01-28 00:00:00,4,"As a disclaimer, I'm not the one to be too hung up on there not being a general message to a film. That said, in Mississippi grind you think you are being led on a journey with a message, but find yourself on a rather dark and hopeless carousel ride.You're lied to by the film as well as the main characters, and although played very well by Reynolds and Mendelsohn, there's nothing to make you care for the two protagonists. They're all over the place, like the movie itself, and it's both confusing and irritating to watch - especially if you've ever known somebody with a gambling problem. Don't trust anyone, including yourself, seems to be the prevailing message of the film.The narrative promises you heartwarming situations and emotional heartbreak and delivers nothing but apathy and self-destruction. I'm sure if we could just be allowed some sympathy for the main duo, maybe we wouldn't feel so cheated by the end. I'm not sure who, if any, to recommend this movie to unless they can watch this without getting emotionally involved.It seems in the end neither the viewer or the house wins."
" Pretty good.
",0.7269,0.8861,2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"This was a decent movie. It has a good soundtrack, looked nice, and all the acting was stellar. While some scenes seem to meander a bit, it wasn't too boring. The highlight is definitely whenever Ryan Reynolds is onscreen. I don't know if I'd recommend this movie, but it's not bad."
" Two Friends Sharing a Mutual Interest
",0.836,-0.3507,2018-10-22 00:00:00,4,"This film essentially begins with a man named ""Gerry"" (Bruce Mendelsohn) playing poker in a gambling house in Dubuque, Iowa. While playing another man by the name of ""Curtis"" (Ryan Reynolds) joins the group and after several hands offers to buy a drink for Gerry. One thing leads to another and soon Gerry and Curtis become good friends due mainly to their mutual interest in gambling. However, as time goes by it soon becomes apparent that Gerry is clearly addicted to gambling and doesn't know when to quit. As a result Gerry is deeply in debt and the more he tries to gamble his way out of it the worse things become. Curtis, on the other hand, gambles mostly for excitement and is much more disciplined. Not only that, but Curtis also has an uncanny ability to read people and quickly surmises the challenges that come from being a friend of Gerry. And it's these traits that cause each of them to feel a mutual friendship to one another. Now, rather than reveal any more and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that I was not nearly as impressed with it as most other reviewers seem to be. For starters, the plot seemed to lose focus at times and the pace was much too slow for my tastes as well. Likewise, I didn't especially care for the ending all that much either. In short, although others may disagree, I found this film to be rather dull and pretentious and it's for those reasons that I have rated it slightly below average."
" Great movie

It was like the writers just threw him in the movie. The movie made no sense. The story totally and completely far fetched. SharkNado 6 is more believable than this confused attempt to portray a gambling addict."
" Accurate portrayal of a gambling addict
",0.0,0.676,2018-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Obviously the movie is not just about gambling addiction. But that aspect of the movie is portrayed quite accurately. Everyone knows what to expect from Ryan Reynolds, and he did a good job with his acting. But Mendelsohn's performance is immensely underrated. He portrays the sadness, the desperation, the hopelessness, the emptiness, the soullessness... everything that hides behind the eyes and within the mind of a gambling addict. He knows that gambling is not about winning money at all. (And the soundtrack is GREAT!). I will use this opportunity to recommend ""Owning Mahowny"" if you are interested in seeing another great movie about gambling addiction with the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman. I give ""Mississippi Grind"" 6.5/10"
" Not a thrill ride; a story; a character study
",-0.2755,0.8774,2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"And a good one. A story about the highs and lows of addicted gamblers, made friends by their addiction. In any other world these two men would not have met; but at a card table they are one in the same. The story was a bit slow at times but I think it added to the hopelessness of a too long night turning into day and finding the next thing to do. This movie is more like reading a novel, not watching something like Casino, or 21.It's not a great story, but it's a good one. I'm glad I spent the time."
" Good movie, good story, great soundtrack, well worth a watch.
",0.9169,0.9682,2018-07-23 00:00:00,8,"A good buddy road movie with a difference. Our heroes are actually junkies of an overlooked yet very destructive drug - gambling. Like the more infamous alcohol and chemical substances, this drug tears families apart and makes some people destitute. This isn't a Cool Hand Luke were you hustle your way through games to pay for the big tournament to be crowned the best pool player. This is hard core addiction as opposed to recreational thrills. They'll bet on dogs, horses, ballgames or sports they know little about but odds look good. Games of chance they'll take it on, poker / blackjack and dice. They win big it's not enough, it ended with the last show of cards or roll of dice. Need the thrill again, even bigger, everything you've won on a single throw of a card or dice. Real life says this never ends well."

",0.8588,0.9594,2018-07-12 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this movie. Definitely not my normal fare and to be honest I was expecting not to enjoy it. But man I was pleasantly surprised! It's definitely a more subdued film, but these two actors just chew up every scene they're in. It's a really sad and realistic tale of two gambling addicts, they both struggle differently, but ultimately that's what they both are. I was actually thrown off a couple times by thinking that I knew where it was headed or what each persons motivations were, but each time I was off the mark. Both guys aren't the greatest people, they don't make the right choices, and they both have their major issues. And what I find sad but a unique way of ending the movie, was that they both ended the movie pretty much where they started. It's a realistic look at what the cycle of addiction can do. 
Great movie with great acting! Definitely give it a watch!"
" A Natural Seven
",0.3612,-0.85,2017-10-06 00:00:00,7,"Ben Mendelsohn steals this buddy movie about a pair of sad sack 'grinders' (a term for people who gamble for a living) who befriend each other after meeting across a poker table. Reynolds has made a solid career playing fast talking cocky charmers but placed in a supporting role amidst this cast he brings a depth and complexity to his character that is original and thoughtful. This is about people who are doing the best they can trying to manage in a world that is unfair, uneventful and especially unforgiving to people who choose to live in a world constantly surrounded with bad choices. They are unexceptional well-intentioned people who long ago abandoned any fatal optimism for the future but still need to make their way within the limited confines of what they know and where they find themselves. It is a grim, lonely and stark existence which makes for an engrossing film."
" Great character acting by Ryan Reynolds
",0.6249,0.9734,2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"As much as I wouldn't expect to be re-watching for the third time in a row a movie starring one of Hollywood's ""men of the hour"", it is Reynolds' truly stellar performance that kept me glued to the screen. What I particularly appreciate about the movie is how well crafted the two leading characters are and the particular depth that Reynolds adds to the drifting casino-frequenting thrill-seeker he plays (who by his own admission is better at darts than gambling and is a casino regular simply because he ""likes people""). Curtis (Reynolds' character) is a sort of a perennial wanderer, set on a journey of discovery, oblivious however as to what exactly it is he is searching for. A typical ""lost soul"" in the Gen X sense, Curtis loathes any sort of predictability and never stays in one place for too long and has a debilitating fear of committing to places and people - love interests, too. Reynolds manages to turn Curtis into a likable character one could relate to so much so that when he professes his love to his on again-off again casino hostess girlfriend, it almost looks like he is finally ready to settle down and anchor ""in love"". But, love is the ultimate gamble for him, something he is yet unprepared for, with the next roll of the dice at the next casino holding more appeal. The thrill of the ""open road"" and the endless possibilities it brings with it have been nicely captured in this movie, depicting the very essence of the American dream which lies in the understanding that, in Curtis's own words, ""the journey is the destination""."
" A Very Boring Movie.
",-0.3804,0.7738,2017-06-03 00:00:00,1,"If you still haven't seen Mississippi Grind, don't waste your time, the pacing of the movie is extremely slow, the only half interesting part was around an hour and nine minutes into the movie where there was an intense few minute conversation between the two main characters, after that short scene the film instantly becomes boring again.If you want to watch a drama about people with financial problems i recommend ""99 Homes"" which is much more interesting and the pacing of the film is faster and straight to the point."
" A comedy about friendship and taking chances
",0.7351,0.9908,2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a great comedy about friendship and taking chances. Reynolds and Mendelsohn have a great chemistry and also deliver amazing individual performances. The way Mendelsohn portrays emotions and feeling with his body is simply one of the best body acting performance I have ever seen. Also the cinematography is genius. With plenty of medium shots and close ups the camera captures all the emotions and makes the scenes even more intense and the viewer feel for the character. What I also really liked was the fact that in this movie the younger man is a role model for the older man, which is a rather uncommon concept in this kind of movie. And for every Ryan Reynolds fan out there, this is probably his best performance right after Deadpool ;) All in all I can say that this is a very well made movie that is less about gambling and rather about people and the power of believe and friendship."
" Compulsive gambling disease on display ......
",0.0,-0.7261,2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Questionable entertainment value, watching two '"" train wrecks"" happening at the same time. It's a buddy road movie with the theme being the pathetic lives that are the result of compulsive gambling. Two losers like Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds play certainly don't deserve any glorification. The low point is when Mendelsohn tries to steal money from his ex-wife. The acting is good, however the story meanders, and at times is sleep inducing. You do get some nice photography of various towns along the Mississippi. What is not so nice is the toxic effect their gambling addiction has on their relationships. Both characters come across as self serving jerks, with little regard for anything but their own destructive behavior. - MERK"
" Not a true or realistic or accurate portrayal of a gambling addict as some say. Still worth the watch
",-0.1109,0.9874,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Just a few quick points, not a full review. I feel compelled to add my alternate comments as so many reviewers seem to think that this is a ""true"" or ""accurate"" portrayal of a compulsive gambler. In my opinion it is not a true or accurate or real life portrayal of the life and luck of a compulsive gambler. Some parts, like any addiction ring true, like searching his ex-wife's sock drawer for a fix of cash for the next gamble. In this single act loosing his self respect and any respect or trust that his ex-wife may have held for him. However, towards the end of the film, in particular, contact with reality and true or accurate real life is lost. Blackjack gambling winning hand after hand after hand is truly the stuff of film fantasy and not what happens in the gritty real life, furthermore the soppy, sugary end to the film is frankly ridiculous and way off kilter to a realistic story. Addictions, of any kind do not end happily. So to conclude, the film is not realistic and cannot be construed or expected to be so, that said, it was a very enjoyable watch and the lead played his part perfectly, well done."
