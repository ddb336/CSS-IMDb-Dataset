" ""We are Family""
",0.0,0.9828,2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I adore this movie. It's a funny feel good movie, the characters you can imagine being actual real life family. It is beautifully cast , and a lovely script, with lots of humour. The music is also great. I'd love to see a ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3"" (with the same cast) !"
" Good, Bad, & Very Greek
",-0.1531,0.9928,2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"A good, bad film, maybe even a great, terrible film. Beyond cheesy, but a lot of fun too. The casting is the same as the original film but it is no where near as good as the first, but that's okay, after over a decade it was the best that could have been made.There are genuine laughs throughout the film, everyone is likeable and if you have any experience of Greeks/Greece, it taps into a lot ridiculous characteristics. Some of the actresses are clearly not Greek and instead it's like Russians have infiltrated the family. Overall, it is a really daft film, very easy to watch, but it's never going to win any awards. You want something fun? You liked the first? Give it a go!"
" Oh
",0.0,-0.743,2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,Stop. Delete. IQ saved.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Billions of brain cells are dying in a single scene.
" Paint dries faster
",0.0,-0.2191,2021-01-16 00:00:00,3,"This film shares the same problem with its predecessor. The pacing is off. Both movies rush through the funny parts and drag through the filler and boring parts for an eternity. What saved the first movie was more or less good writing and funny jokes.The main character, Toula, not only didn't get any character development, but she actually regressed. The whole point of the first movie was for her to find her voice and to define herelf as a strong, independent woman. But in this movie she's still a maid to her family and lets them treat her without respect. She also still works at her aunt's travel agency and lives 2 meters from her parents.There's a scene in the middle of the movie where Toula's aunt (the only bearable character) tells her to stop trying to fix every problem in the family, which sounds like a good advice, but at the end of the movie they all ask her to start fixing problems again so it seems like this conflict is never resolved.In fact this movie lacks a good conflict and a good resolution. Toula's mother thinks that her father doesn't care enough about her, Toula's husband suddenly feels ignored by her (but his character is too uninteresting and predictable to have a thought on his own and try to solve the problem himself), their daughter wants to study away from her family because they embarrass her, and Toula doesn't know how to get that stupid grin off her face. The movie implies that a solution for any problem is a wedding. The characters don't talk about their issues with each other and they don't showcase any differences in their toxic behaviour, but they got married/found a boyfriend so it's all good.If I could get a minute of my life for each time a character in this movie was asked a question, and then instead of answering like a normal person would, looked away with a sly grin maybe I could earn back the time it took to watch this idiotic movie."
" I love these movies & I'm proud of my Greek heritage!
",0.8221,0.945,2020-06-20 00:00:00,10,"A great story, with an excellent cast. I love these movies a lot! Overall they're funny heart-warming films for the family."
" Blah blah yawn!
",-0.2714,0.4596,2020-03-14 00:00:00,3,"A mere shadow of the first one.
It's the symbol of the modern era: Tick every diversity and girl power box it is possible to tick, but don't bother making a good movie.
I lost interest at Maria giving some long winded speech about what she could have done besides get married. Yawn... Roll eyes... That is not the strong, confident, lovable Maria from the first movie who was everything because of what she had created throughout her life.
Don't bother with this nonsense. How these actors did this subpar script with a straight face is beyond me. Must have been desperate for the cheques."
" I loved the first one, and enjoyed this one.
",0.802,0.597,2019-12-12 00:00:00,9,"You can rarely create the magic of a unique type of movie. And they don't here. But, it still is quite enjoyable."
" We loved this movie
",0.5994,0.883,2019-08-23 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to come in defense of this film, in case some people might read negative review and not get to enjoy it. My kids were the ones who decided to rent it, and I was the most wary. I know how sequels can go. I was totally surprised. I agree that a couple of things felt forced. I think the interactions between Toula and Ian seemed forced at times, but this is so high quality for a sequel that I was genuinely impressed. It has a real substance, and reaches into very different territory than the first one did. My kids said they liked this better than the first one. This feels more modern (naturally) and moves a little faster than the first one I think."
" Slow start, but it find its legs.
",0.0,0.8332,2019-04-06 00:00:00,7,The first half of the film relies on recycled jokes (A couple groaners) and is unsure of how to find its own story. The second half rediscovers the charm of the first film and gives a satisfying conclusion. Not as many laughs this time around but the characters are fun to be around and that was worth the 90 minutes.
" Light hearted and fun
",0.5106,0.9519,2019-04-06 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand what people's problems are with this movie. It is light hearted and cute, like the original. Is it as deep, no, but it is number 2 in the sequels. They are usually not as good as 1 or 3. It's funny, cute, and for the most part you can watch it with the wjole family. I liked it. Definitely worth a eatch!"
" A must see for fans of the original
",0.3182,0.9708,2019-02-13 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed it - naturally, not the same as the first - and there are things that I would have done differently... However- it was great to see the original cast - all of them ! The whole family ! Lots of belly laugh moments.Michael Constantine is still my favorite! I love his character he is phenomenal!"
" People change. Greeks don't.
",0.0,0.9977,2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Made in 2002, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding's"" box office was around $368 Million. It was a cheerful film and received mostly positive reviews. Purely based on this success, they wanted to suck the film dry by making a sitcom based on the same idea which failed after seven episodes, because there was nothing else left to tell. Here in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" there are two different stories which are harmonized with the lives of the family after 14 years. If you have seen the original film, you should remember that Ian (John Corbett) and Toula (Nia Vardalos) had a daughter. One side of the story focuses on her and her teenager problems and the other side focuses on the marriage of Toula's mother and father. Toula's father finds out that their marriage paper has never been signed. When Toula's mother learns about this, she demands to get married. After fifty years of being together, they get married as loud as Toula's marriage, like the title suggests. So, the story bounces back and forth between these two main stories and the relation between Ian and Toula. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is still a warm-hearted story with all its sincerity but this is pretty much it. The film doesn't have any purpose anymore. Based on this idea, you can make as many films as possible and, eventually, people will stop seeing them. That being said, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2's"" box office dropped drastically from $368 Million to $88.9 Million. People got the idea. They are a big family, they are funny and different and they have strong bonds but that's pretty much it. There is nothing else this family can give to the audience. Each character is easily predictable, which suggests the weakness of the screenplay. When you look carefully, the film has no aim anymore. They are planning a wedding and a lot of funny things are happening along the way. Those funny things are just the different versions of the same jokes from the original film.Cultural differences between Americans and Greeks are more obvious in this one. The film carries the message of the beauty of living together no matter how different we are. In ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,"" everyone seems to be leading the film. The pressure over Toula is lifted but she is still struggling to keep everything together. This is time consuming and leads her to neglect her own family. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" focuses also on the marriage of Ian and Toula. The film has a lot of directions and the director Kirk Jones manages to keep them all together, but still he can't provide something new or different to the audience, which makes it an average film. It would be perfectly fine if they wouldn't have made the 2nd film. Cultural diversity was the strongest point of the first film. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" depends purely on this and fails to bring something on the table. The customs and behaviors are just repeating themselves. This is still tolerable because they are funny, but, once again, they are not new. This is the reason why I wrote above that no one would have missed a 2nd film based on the same idea. Even the locations are the same.Regarding the performances there is nothing new. Like in the first film I like Andrea Martin's acting performance. Andrea Martin's character, Aunt Voula, is a problem solver. She is a person everyone can depend on and one of the most important women in the family. It is an easy role to play but hard to make it perfect. Andrea Martin manages to make it perfect from the way she walks to the way she talks. If this film needs to be saved, she is there to do it. Other than her, I haven't seen a worth mentioning performance because, just like the 1st film, this one is not a character-based film either. This time I have enjoyed the soundtracks. Especially the Greek oriented ones. In most of the scenes I had the feeling that I am watching a European film.Once again, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" doesn't bring anything new on the table. Watching it is not a waste of time but don't have higher expectations. If you loved the characters and the story in the 1st film then watch this one to see how they are doing after 14 years. Written by Nia Vardalos and produced by Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson and Gary Goetzman, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" is a film of happy thoughts and a strong traditional family."

" Waste of time, so sad
",-0.7777,-0.0889,2018-06-03 00:00:00,1,"There were a few skits throughout the movie that were funny but over very disrespectful and horribly written. Nia, what was that? That is not Greek culture especially not the Greek Orthdox faith."
" Excelent Sequel
",0.0,0.128,2018-04-08 00:00:00,9,"With an extraordinary plot, tons of references. It's a good sequel for an excelent movie, in a world where sequels of comedies are the worst possible."
" There you go.
",0.0,0.9325,2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,"While this story follows in line from the first one, it is not so connected that knowledge of the first film is necessary to enjoy this one. The movie starts off with some first person narration by Toula (Nia Vardalos) who realizes she is an over protective mother. Her teen daughter (Elena Kampouris) wants her family to give her space. The other family ""crisis"" is that her parents discover their wedding certificate wasn't signed, hence the title.The film was hilarious. Andrea Martin looks like she is playing a Second City character. There is some coded adult talk ""protect the plucky"" and one scene where a couple is interrupted in a car. For the most part, it is family safe. Nia Vardalos also wrote the film. Kudos.Great comedy."
" Underrated!
",0.0,0.9911,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"I can't believe the awful reviews I've read for this movie. It doesn't revolutionize cinema or anything, but it's fun, it's funny, it's heartfelt, and it's definitely enjoyable even if you've already seen the original. As for everyone saying that it borrows too much from the first film, I imagine these are exclusively professional movie critics who *just* re-watched it prior to viewing the sequel - I don't know about you, but personally, I don't think I even remember half of what happened in the first movie. I mean, it came out 15 years ago for goodness' sake! Anyhow, as an immigrant myself (not from Greece but still), I definitely recognized my family in theirs and found that the updated, 2017 version was thoroughly sweet, funny and enjoyable.Happy viewing!"
" My Big Fat Greek Sequel
",0.0,0.9867,2017-06-25 00:00:00,2,"This was a sad movie to watch because it had all the elements of the first movie -- a great cast and incessant mockery of all the values and traditions of the Greek community -- without the tastefulness. Know where to draw the line.The introduction of the next generation was sweet and well done, but Tula's regression into nerdy cluelessness was too much. All the outrageous choices Maria made in preparation for the major event in the movie (no spoilers) was too much. And please don't get me started on Thia Voula -- who I REALLY LOVED in the first movie! Way to destroy your best characters, Nia!If you're going to put Stamos and Wilson into a movie, give them better lines....Corbett is more the ""suburban hero"" this time around, which I would have also held out for in his place, because who wants to be linked to the sad sad Toula in the sequel after being one of the hotties in Sex in the City?Basically, I loved the first movie and will spend the same number of years between the first and second movies trying to forget that the sequel ever existed.If you haven't seen Nia's other movies -- which are awesome and DON'T have sequels -- watch ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" (also with Corbett) and ""My Life In Ruins"" (Also with Wilson). Nia... I love you and think you're very funny and talented. Don't make sequels."
" Extremely Funny
",0.4927,0.9287,2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"An amazing sequel to the previous 2002 movie.As a Greek-American living in Greece I can relate to these events from stories I have been told by my ""Yiayia"".Hilarious plot.The interference of new technology adds a great taste of modernity in the movie.On-point jokes and amazing stereotypical Greek characters."
" Why was this movie even made?
",0.0,0.8674,2017-04-04 00:00:00,3,"In general, if you are going to do a sequel to a comedy, do it in the first few years after the original. The recent trend of releasing a sequel decades after the original has produced nothing but awful results. While Anchorman 2 and Dumb and Dumber To are obvious examples. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is not only less funny than those two, it has less of a point too. Even people who were big fans of the original are probably wondering why this movie even exists.The plot is pretty straightforward, which is fine for a comedy. Just make us laugh a lot, feel a little, and get attached to the characters, and plot does not matter all that much. We feel for the characters a little bit, especially Gus and Paris. As a matter of fact, Gus's character is a little too tragic for a comedy. There is nothing funny about the way he is treated or redeemed.As far as funny moments go, there are very few in this movie. The writers go to the well four times for a joke that only worked once: the fact that there are no secrets in Greek families. The first time that there was a minor problem and the entire family showed up en mass, it was funny. The second, third and fourth times, it became obvious there just were no real other sources of comedy in this movie.Like most comedy sequels, the movie uses much the same formula as the original. And like most comedy sequels, the same schlock is not nearly as funny the second time around. Jokes are not set up properly, characters are not put in the appropriate situations, and overall the film just falls flat.See this is you wish, but lower your expectations. This is not a fun, family romp. It is almost embarrassingly bad at times, and only occasionally will make you chuckle."
" Derivative and Boring
",-0.3182,0.2348,2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"As much as I enjoyed the original, I wish I could sing the praises of the sequel. But this is one movie that would have been better left to the imagination. It has all of the original characters, along with all of the original jokes and conflict and story. But it was neither funny nor original this time around. The attempts to inject new life into the franchise by the marital conflict, rebellious teenage daughter, and possibly non-marriage of the Portokalos patriarch and matriarch fell flat for me. What was amusing and unique the first time around was simply flat and repetitive now. The characters seemed more like caricatures, and the charades and shenanigans were irritating. I was not drawn in by the contrived plot, nor sympathetic to the characters. I did not care what happened to them and I found myself wanting the movie to be over. I was watching on a plane and was not able to quite finish the movie, but was unbothered. I think fans of the original will be sorely disappointed. This is one film easily missed."
" cinematic equivalent of a garbage disposal
",0.0,0.9468,2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"The gang is all back in the surprisingly-delayed and unrequested sequel to one of the most successful independent films of all time (My Big Fat Greek Wedding still remains the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time, 5th highest grossing film from 2002, highest grossing film to never be #1 at the box office, and is quoted as being one of the most profitable films ever with a 6,150% return on budget). It's a wonder it took them so long to milk this cash cow a little further.The plot, as the title suggests (though isn't there a funner way to title the movie? I thought long and hard and came up with ""My Bigger, Fatter, Greekier Wedding."" Not bad, right?) follows our protagonist, Tula (Nia Vardalos) 17 years after the original. A lot has changed, but not too much. The punchline of the first film showed the newly-weds moving into the house next door to Tula's parents. In this film, nearly the whole block is occupied by the Portakalos clan. It's a wonder the local gawkers haven't been asked to relocate yet.You may remember Tula working as a travel agent, but given the current economy, we learn there is no need for such luxuries in the current Chicago market. Low and behold, she has retreated back to the family's restaurant. Talk about coming full circle.The titular wedding comes from Tula's parents, Gus and Maria, who find out through a bit of digging that their marriage 50 years ago was never certified by a priest. Cue wedding dress shopping montage. The additional drama comes from Paris, Tula and Ian's daughter, who is deciding whether to go to college in Chicago or flee to New York to claim sanctuary from her looney extended family.Tonally, the film is very much identical to the original, which is surprising given how little I enjoyed this film. Where the original found humor in the observations of a stereotypical Greek Orthodox family and an outsider's introduction to such a culture, the sequel lags and lags on jokes we already know. Windex cures all, the root of every word is Greek, and Aunt Voula is as zany as ever. Nia Vardalos in the leading role (and returning as screenwriter (the original earned her an Oscar nomination, no less)) is absolutely lost and a clunker of a star. Originally playing it relatively straight amidst the humor, here she gives way to potty humor and overacting galore. In the original, the film was charming and found humor through it. Here, she has written a weak comedy that she thinks will have the same effect.For being a sequel 14 years in the making, the production felt very rushed, and editing down to camera work is noticeably lacking. The script throws everything but the kitchen sink at us, including a tacked on bit where Joey Fatone reveals himself as gay on the morning of the wedding. Why, I am not sure. John Stamos was billed as a new addition to the cast (fairly genius casting given the film) but phones in a performance of about 5 minutes and promptly is never seen again.After the flop of the TV show (remember the season run of My Big Fat Greek Life?) and the poor reaction to this year's sequel, I think it has become clear that the 2002 hit was simply a flash in the pan, a film that stood on its own despite the studio want to squeeze every last nickel out of it's teat. Hollywood today is driven largely by sequels and reboots and cinematic universes. Maybe in 5 or 10 years we will see a remake. Sometimes though, lightning can only strike once."
