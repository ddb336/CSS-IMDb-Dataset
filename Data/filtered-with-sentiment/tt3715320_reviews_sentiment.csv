" Thou Shalt not Murder, but is Killing acceptable?
",-0.4178,-0.9832,2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"Woody Dostoyevsky! A Mix-up of names is what occurred within when I realized the angst Woody Allen had created with ""Irrational Man"" As the movie reels on, it starts to come together. Contemplate and attempt to Justify a moral murder, from ""Crime and Punishment"". Locking yourself into yourself, not exactly like being in a concentration camp as experienced by the observations of Jean-Paul Sartre of ""Being and Nothingness"" that would tie in with the mentioned existentialist founder Kierkegaard. The movie feeds well the philosophical intent and agony of the protagonist. From Kierkegaard to the experience of Sartre, we are immersed into his moral considerations. However, we must overlook the trite sleuthing during after dinner aperitifs or is it digestifs, he must endure to give the story a basis, as if Mr. Allen wants to provide us a fresh orange, but in the interest of time, crushes 3 or more and simply feeds us a concentrated juice.
The protagonist suffers from perhaps Dysthymia, a form of depression which leaves a man treading water, his head barely above his fate, with the occasional chance that a wave will almost drown him, unless he holds his breath through the rough times. Along comes the usual lifeboats, women who throw you a lifesaver, and in this case, the protagonist has tossed all life savers, including the little blue pills, but hugs his single malt for dear life, until he finds a way out of depression, by contemplating perhaps ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" or ""Thou Shalt not Murder; based on the actions of another. Chomsky would say, if you stop a murderer from taking the life of an innocent, and you take a life in the process, you have only killed. If you are the one taking the life of the innocent, you are a murderer. The movie makes you look back 50 years to the days you read these existentialist concepts, faced by those in concentration camps and elsewhere. Well worth watching, and if you don't get it, read, read the mentioned philosophers, at least some of them.....but apply your own moral guard rails, as this movie proves, there is a difference between murder and kill, something that many have never contemplated until we all face our ""Irrational Man"" or woman within. Well worth watching, whether you are well read or not! Pure entertainment."
" Why girls should settle for good guys over cool guys
",0.6369,0.9903,2021-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Knowing Woody Allen's life ups and downs and all his controversies, you can't help but to think he fantasises over being that charming, mysterious philosophy professor that get a lot young girls. If you want to convince that girl you really want, to settle for a kind, loving, reliable man than the bad boys who she romanticises over, make her watch this film. I personally love Woody Allen films, however, his style with the constant narration and jazz music, is more like theatre than film, and it flies in the face of ""Show, don't tell"". If you can overlook this, and like me, you love dialogue that examines life and death and everything in-between, in every single line, you will love this film."
" Great Existential Film
",0.6249,-0.802,2021-01-14 00:00:00,5,Hated Emma Stones character. She had too many morals...ending sucked wasn't as edgy as the dialogue thought it was. Watchable film.
" Ivy League Woody!
",0.0,-0.6847,2020-08-07 00:00:00,6,"A decade on from his clever and intriguing Match Point and director/writer Woody Allen serves up Irrational Man, which plays around with some of the same ideas. It has Joaquin Phoenix in a role tailor-made for him; a philosophy lecturer experiencing an existential crisis. But to be quite frank it's just not as interesting. It doesn't have the range of support characters of the earlier film, nor the suspense, nor the Hitchcockian twists. Instead it unfolds as an upbeat Dostoevsky New England tale. It is Woody Allen; but he's not at his best here."
" Standard Woody Allen

" Great Film, But That SONG . . .
",0.3716,0.8838,2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"In the beginning when Abe is driving into town in his Volvo, you hear a jazzy Ramsey Lewis tune, uncharacteristic for the ""you say tomato, I say tomAHto"" soundtracks Woody usually uses. However, the song plays over and over - and OVER again, to the point of major annoyance. Maybe for a reason known only to the director, this was intentional. Hard to understand why women go crazy for Abe Lucas, but a great film anyway. Fans of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" especially will enjoy this."

",0.3612,0.9656,2019-12-28 00:00:00,4,"Joaquin Phoenix, one of the greatest actors of his generation - maybe of all time - is completely unbelievable as his character from the first frame. And it continued until the last. How do you make a great film when the central character is so miscast? You can't. And all the ""really, this is a great film!"" piano music won't change it.This is not a great film. It's not even a good one. Emma Stone and Parker Posey liven things up enough to make it watchable but that's all it ever reaches. Just being watchable. And great directors should never make just watchable films.I watch films like this and wonder, why? Why was this made? With all of Woody Allen's success, what would make him want to release this? I don't get it.This is Joaquin Phoenix's worst performance that I have seen to date. I didn't even think he was capable of a bad performance. I mean, outside of I'm Still Here. But he was so miscast in this part I think even he didn't know what to do with it. But it's Woody Allen, who turns down Woody Allen?The film was pleasant to watch, I wasn't cringing or rolling my eyes or anything. But if you're looking for a good Woody Allen film to watch, this ain't it."

" Dark and beautifully done

And his colleague, Lisa who's a professor married to someone else, and student, Jill, who's already having a steady boyfriend all laid their eyes on him. And fell for his fragile sad history and charm.The twist is really intriguing, great movie!"
" A good tale.
",0.4404,0.9428,2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"It was my first Woody Allien experience and, although it is not a masterpiece, it is a good movie, since there is a lot of decent things there: good acting, story and characters, kinda slow pacing, etc.It seemed to me like a short drama tale you could read in a book, like the movies from Guillermo Del Toro, but without the phantasy aspects. The movie itself isn't too long (about 1h40), and the drama flows very naturally, but it's not too introspective; isn't a emotionally heavy movie (like Black Swan).Also, there are some nice ironies there, wich are enlightened by the animated soundtrack during the ""dark"" scenes. Some people would call it ""comedy"", but I wouldn't say it's a comedy movie. It's more like a soft storytell drama.Like I said, it's not a magnificent movie, but it is very entertaining and well done."
" Took a turn for the better
",0.4404,-0.3981,2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,"This film started off as a typical comedy drama about an unpredictable drunken philosopher professor. And eventually there comes love interest and things begin to get settled in.Having no knowledge of the film originally but knowing it was a Woody Allen film. Not exactly being a fan but perhaps seeking a couple of his films.This film isn't quite as predictable and the latter half does get more intriguing and develops in a more darker territory.The characters are all sort of scumy and not exactly good people. Joaquin Phoenix plays his role well as we are to sympathize with him. Emma Stone's character isn't likeable as she's shown to be a cheater and comes off as whiny, yet acts as if she's a saint. Parker Posey's character isn't exactly better as she's also cheating (on her husband for Joaquin).But what does make the film interesting and easy to grasp is the conclusion as we are interested in seeing how everything unfolds."
" Woody failed at everything with this one
",-0.5106,-0.6742,2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"A good premise. Can you rationalize crimes as ""good"" in civilian life? It is edgy. That's the only not even good, just interesting, thing that Allen nailed here.The casting was atrocious. Phoenix looked more like a lazy teacher (like Jack Black in the really good School of Rock) than a depressed philosopher. Emotionally though, Phoenix was able to act himself into the role. But Emma Thompson displayed one of the poorest acting jobs I've ever seen. She didn't seem smart enough, interesting enough, emotionally involved enough for any part of her character.Besides the terrible casting, we had a curious direction for clearly another black/dark comedy with intellectuality mixed in. The movie took itself way too seriously for its own good. It wasn't even close to being fun but it was too ""wacky"" to take seriously.Also the dialogue was terrible. Too much bland exposition. Too many ridiculous phrases (one in particular, from a supposedly brilliant student, was ""what some people live through"", about an injustice towards a woman and her kids that she just heard. In what world does that ""smart"" student lives? Only ignorant people wouldn't know about those types of systemic injustices. Was that a plot of the movie? How ""smart"" college students are actually stupid? Then why the really smart professor said that she was smart?)Also, the unnecessary and pointless voice-over was a decision that I can't comprehend. (literally, its never used to say anything that wasn't obvious or easy to figure it out).Also, the edgy premise resolves itself in a really sanitized (or there I say cowardly) way."
" Crime and Punishment: Allen on Dostoevsky, Part III
",-0.7717,-0.9956,2019-09-26 00:00:00,4,"The latest and weakest entry in Woody Allen's semi-trilogy of movies inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel ""Crime and Punishment,"" ""Irrational Man"" (a title taken from William Barrett's book that helped introduce and translate to English the director's brand of existentialism) regurgitates much of the same material from the filmmaker's prior ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989) and, especially, ""Match Point"" (2005). (Allen's ""Love and Death"" (1975) is also full of references, but more so to ""War and Peace"" and the Russian novel in general.) One of the more conspicuous aspects of this addition is that it attempts to play with subverting the traditional role of women in Allen's prior two ""Crime and Punishment"" pictures, but only after it begins as arguably one of his most sexist representations of the opposite sex yet. It's easy, too, to read into the movie as a reflection of Allen's real life, especially because it's his first picture after the publication of Dylan Farrow's letter renewing the public scandal of Allen being accused of raping or otherwise sexually assaulting her.This real-life connection is heightened by the plot in ""Irrational Man"" involving the murder of a family-court judge assumed to be biased in a custody hearing, which recalls the fallout of the case pitting Allen against his former lover (and frequent lead actress) Mia Farrow over their kids. Additionally, the movie replays the same situations Allen has already covered again and again in his oeuvre, such as the neurotic man (usually either played by Allen or based on his persona) conflicted between a relationship with either a younger woman or one closer to his own age. In this case, Emma Stone's student and Parker Posey's colleague throw themselves at Joaquin Phoenix's depressed, drunkard and impotent (in sex and writing) philosophy professor. Stone nods along to Phoenix's comment that, ""In a society shaped by men, women are seen as relative beings existing only in relationship to men""--a spot-on characterization of the movie itself--while Posey proposes to be his muse. The picture's beginning is full of dialogue of these women and others on campus fawning and gossiping over the man. We're told he's brilliant, but when we actually hear from him, he informs his class that, ""If you learn nothing else from me, you should learn that much of philosophy is verbal masturbation."" A humorous line, doubtless, but when that turns out to be about the extent of his insight throughout, those claims of brilliance ring hollow. Furthermore, it seems more likely that Phoenix's Abe would get away with murder than with keeping his job while publicly drinking alcohol from a flask on campus and carrying on a sexual relationship with one of his pupils.Perhaps, the one exception, and a main reason I can't entirely dislike this third Dostoevskian attempt by Allen, is that Abe murders based on a rationale more akin to that of the Russian author's Raskolnikov than in either of the director's prior ""Crime and Punishment"" rebuttals. In one of the many, repetitive scenes of esoteric quotations and name droppings, Abe claims to love the Russian authors; ""Dostoevsky got it,"" he chimes. Stone also finds a copy of ""Crime and Punishment"" full of notes in Abe's home. (""Match Point"" also included a shot of its protagonist studying the book.) Abe's voiceover narration also reflects the inner thoughts of Raskolnikov. He compares the judge to a roach, as Raskolnikov did the pawnbroker to an insect, and rationalizes that the murder is justified because it will benefit society. Or, maybe, he was merely moved by finally hearing a woman speaking about someone other than himself... although, I guess, he ends up making it about him, anyways.In the end, the subversion of the gender imbalance, including switching the voiceover narrator, and Allen's reversal on the issue of punishment is faint, including a trite imitation of the moral of luck from ""Match Point""--the ""practical"" flashlight replacing the ring and tennis metaphor from the previous picture. Abe even plays Russian roulette, to ridiculously make the point. Murder as restorative of life, as Abe here rediscovers his mojo, was also already played out with childbirth in ""Match Point,"" too. There's a potentially-intriguing scene involving funhouse mirrors at an amusement park, but nothing is done in the way of the clever cinematic reflexivity in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Overall, ""Irrational Man"" is little else than verbal masturbation where women are seen as relative beings existing only in relationship to men."
" Chemistry and whoa, what, how are you finishing this story?

But it is true, guys attract women with ""complex, brooding"" behavior. Don't know how they put up with us, really. And so you care about the characters and it gets spicy in the end and you start wondering how Mr. Allen will resolve it and then he does. It is why we watch his films."

" It's about GenX
",0.0,-0.9924,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"This is almost an anti-performance with how little he gives it so in the process reveals as careful craft; the lazy and pathetic voiceovers as if recorded on the way to the mailbox. The key is both Parker Posey (genX icon) and Phoenix (genX royalty) hijack it with their middle age as a reflection of their generation. She doesn't hesitate to go through the motions of some affair. He has no place with his intellect. His brooding sensitivity and charisma, the laziness is not being devoid of purpose but having no purpose imparted on him, as in Woody Allen films, lash out against society's failure to embrace them. All his movies mock god, which is fun, and of course the exceptional are right to be angry... if not how thrilling the experience of life is for both the lowest and highest as he comes to see, the ones in between who really suffer. Gen X's lost generation apathy as the last before globalization where people were made markers. But people still happened. Millennials, as Emma Stone, partake naively, they 'walk the line' of living without knowing there was once society and bring about the effect of today's NPC confusion. The feat of Phoenix's performance is for how it's so cerebral, where we don't question the stupidity of the film. To say Phoenix is the Gen X Brando or Nicholson misunderstands Gen X's subversion, where even greatness would be rebelled against. (There is the famous image of Phoenix shaking his head in disgust as his 'best actor' nomination was read: ""Don't pit us against each other like gladiators in this battle for capital, find a life, a sincerity."") It may explain why his best roles are so wounded and pained, slurred, effortless, lazy, of course, we skip over indulging the male pain, or the pain is foregone and not worth remarking with some great frame, in the world of post-everything. The solution, as shaking his head to accolades, is throws away the frame. Target pain first, wound on screen to read for us; where the movies fail he still functions as a reaction inside it. So a different sort of consciousness grappling Woody Allen that is accidentally profoundly about GenX, they did not at the time realize how right they were within defiance."
" A moral response to ""Match Point"" and a very high point in Allen's recent filmography...
",0.0,0.9991,2019-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Finally! A Woody Allen film with a linear plot and ""what if"" dilemmas disseminated all through a thought-provoking campus-set story, a symphony of thoughts and actions without any false note and that would catch any skeptical mind off-guard. Allen surely delivered on that one!""Irrational Man"" covers many philosophical questions about the rationality of individual ""morality"" and their possible interference with ethic. Abe, the newly hired philosophy teacher played by Joaquin Phoenix, doesn't believe the intellectual medicine he sells to his students, his dark and brooding attitude makes up for the lack of enthusiasm in his endeavor and is enough to earn admiration, if not fascination, but the man remains totally unsatisfied about himself and pretension isn't his strongest suit.One day, he's given a test (not a taste) of his own medicine through an intellectual challenge that could only emerge from the creativity of Woody Allen: a situation that gives its full meaning to the word existentialism, a hackneyed word that only inspired vague interpretations of the word ""accomplishment"" but in the film, it's shown as a moral weapon, more specifically, a double-edged sword when confused with a sort of misguided sense of entitlement, a great illustration of the idea that hell is paved by good intentions... or maybe that quote from ""Chinatown"" that sums it up perfectly: ""most people never have to face the fact that at the right time, the right place, they're capable of anything."" Abe won't be one of these.And so Abe undergoes a smooth transition from one state of mind to another as if we had to understand what's eating him before understanding what could regenerate his lust for life. Phoenix feels like overplaying the intellectual malcontent in quest for a meaning in the beginning and it takes not one but two women to try to break the ice and finds what's under that depressed carapace of his, Parker Posey is Rita the lively and sensual teacher who instantly falls in love and Jill is the brilliant student who has the typical crush on her charismatic teacher. See, the film offers so many common tropes to better avert them. Abe looks like your typical alcoholic womanizer but he's impotent and his suicidal impulses turn everybody off... when eventually things go better, he's wise enough to keep it platonic with Jill, because she's engaged, and if you think Jill will abandon everything to follow her teacher and do the right thing by breaking up with the dull boyfriend, you've got another thing coming.As usual with the best Allen films, you have a fine set-up that introduces to characters with clearly drawn personalities but unclear motives and then there's something that changes everything: the motives get clearer and the personalities reveal new depths. It's a simple conversation overheard in a cafÃ© that changes the course of Abe's life, triggering a new vision with a tangible effect on Jill and Rita. It's a decision that calls for an act, one of heavy proportions but deemed necessary because wishing is useless and action is meaningful. And from that point, the film is like a great waltz under a tertiary tempo: one for the triangular love and the way Abe's charm works way too much not to be an omen for complications, one for the moral dilemmas over which I hesitated to give a definite judgment, telling myself ""that better goes somewhere"" and finally a response to ""Match Point"" where 'bad things' went unpunished, and not even suspected.In fact, the film is so smooth and engaging that the ending feels a bit hasty in its execution, sometimes the right thing to happen isn't necessarily the right one when it comes to end with a final ""wow"", but obviously, ""Match Point"" had already made its point and ""Irrational Man"" needed to take us back to some sanity. Many movies provide cynical examples of characters succeeding while being morally corrupt, and it's refreshing to have films that bravely set the ""boring"" but necessary moral aspect of the problem. Abe is an interesting character indeed, he draws us toward his charismatic personality to the point that our own convictions are challenged... to a limit of course. And it's for movies like these that I've always admired Woody Allen and after the disappointing ""You will Meet a Tall and Dark Stranger"", here's one that succeeds in almost every department.Not too many characters but what's there is three-dimensional, unpredictable yet consistent, a plot that goes through many fluctuations while attached to its spinal topics and that little zest of wit that tickles your intellect and makes you wonder what you'd do if you were in ""their"" place. The film saddened me when I thought of the director's recent downfall into persona non grata territory. I've taken his last movies like consolations, if he's lost his touch then there was no need to go further, maybe his creative juice had stopped to drain such clever and brilliant films but ""Irrational Man"" made me reconsider, Allen can still surprise you... and he does it so brilliantly that I would separate the art from the artist, and I wish enough actors in Hollywood would do it so the only true Hollywood auteur can make movies like this, disinterested and interesting, devoid of any calculation except for giving a shot to ""it"" actresses, like Emma Stone who delivers a terrific performance one year before her Oscar-winning role in ""La La Land"".The film restored my faith in Woody Allen, his ""CafÃ© Society"" left me cold but I guess there's a pattern in his long filmography, every 2-3 years, he makes 'that' film that feels undeniably good, if not great. ""Irrational Man"" is the second highest point of the 2010s after ""Midnight in Paris"", I wish there's enough time for Allen to make one great film... might be his last from the way things are going."

" Disappointing ending. Deus ex machina.
",-0.4939,-0.9958,2018-12-11 00:00:00,1,"The story: a respected philosophy teacher is depressed to a point of not being able to perform sexually, even though there are an older and a younger woman after him, because he's tired of dealing with abstract thoughts that will not affect the world.
He spends a long time speaking to his younger student, who already has a boyfriend, is great at philosophy, and tries to get him to get out of his depression.
She invites him to social gatherings, to take action, tells him that he's dangerous, and that she's no middle class mind restricted, impels him to not go the regular moral way, and shows him a situation of great injustice (a judge is abusing his power over a woman).
The philosopher teacher, secretly decides to kill the judge. And since he's doing something he considers concrete and moral, he starts to get out of his depression.
He end up killing the judge.
The young woman finds out that he did it. She flips out, switching her character completely in a Deus Ex Machina way. Her character gets broken in 3 ways: She can't accept the murder, even though she wanted danger and agression. She can't even discuss it philosophically, even though she was a great original thinker philosophy student. Even the love she had for the professor isn't enough to let her accept it, making her not only stop loving him, but also saying that she is probably going to tell the police about it if he doesn't do it himself.
Since now he loves life, because he's not depressed, he creates a trap for her, by making the elevator of her piano teacher building not work, so that when he calls the elevator, it won't come up, but the door will open, so that he can throw her into the pit, making her plunge to death.
As she comes, he pretends to be sorry about his actions, and when he tries to throw her in the pit, she ends up throwing him.Movie flaws: Besides the main psychological flaw of the movie, where a character completely changes her personality to fit in with the script the writer intended, there are more flaws:
Even though the professor is supposed to be very intelligent, and has an infinite amount of time to kill the judge, he does it so by leaving many clues behind that he did it, like having a chemistry student see him among a lot of poisons (he could've chosen a time where students weren't there, or killed the student that saw him, or decided to give up on the poison idea), he talks to a person about killing, he tells another person about hating the judge, he tells people that he thinks the judge was killed by a specific poison, even though that's not public knowledge, he leaves notes behind about the judge name on his possession, and the worst of all: he decides to do the poisoning in broad daylight in the park, after following him for a week. Is this a world without security cameras? Is this a world without people who go every day at the park and know who are the people that come every day and who are the new people? How does he deliver a poisoned cup to the judge without leaving fingerprints?
On the attempt of the muder of the student: he believes he can kill her, because he's phisically stronger than her, and that he knows that the elevator shaft is going to open into a pit while she doesn't know it. But, when he calls the elevator, he doesn't place himself or her (he could do it because of their past intimacies) in a position that a simple push could've killed her. He doesn't try to attack her from behind. He tries to grab her, instead of pushing her. After grabbing her, he doesn't try to pivot her to the hole. He doesn't act like someone much stronger than she is. He loses grip on her, when he loses balance. She gets loose without really hurting him. He lost balance because he tripped on a gift he got her in the past, that falls from her purse during the grapple struggle (deus ex machina).My opinion: the end is so bad, that it made me think, initially, that the ending must have been changed because of the audience or the producers didn't accept it.
To find out later that it was a Woody Allen movie, made me see things differently: At this point in his life, he doesn't have to compromise to please people (he hasn't been compromising to please people for a long long while), so this movie final product should be what he wanted. Which means that either: 1) he is an idiot and he didn't see the flaws in his creation, or 2) he thinks the majority of his audience are idiots and they won't notice the flaws.
It doesn't matter if it's 1 or 2, because in both situations, he'd deserve a 1 as a rating."

To invigorate his life, the profession concocts a plan to help this stranger by 'removing' the judge causing them agony. Once he accomplishes is objective, how will things play out with the people that now know him best? Will his life seem brighter or darker? What a strange little story. It had a clear objective and did it well. There were many philosophical musings about how one fits into this world, chance, choices, happiness, inspiration and especially morality. It was well-produced, acted well, meaty dialog and built up good tension."
" Commercial Moralist Conclusion

However he is a nihilist man living an existential crisis after the losses of his best friend in Iraq and of his wife that left him with a friend while he was helping people in New Orleans. The promiscuous Professor Rita Richards (Parker Posey) unsuccessfully tries to have sex with Abe. However he feels a platonic attraction by his brilliant student Jill Pollard (Emma Stone) and spends most of his leisure time with her as a friend. One day, they overhear a conversation about a corrupt judge in a diner and Abe secretly plots the plan of a perfect crime. Will he set his plan in motion?""Irrational Man"" is a film by Woody Allen where he blends his style with the idea of HitchcockÂ´s ""Strangers on a Train"". The lovely Emma Stone has excellent performance. The plan of Abe Lucas based on the principle that a stranger without motive could commit the perfect crime works very well until the commercial moralist conclusion. Instead of making a thought provoking amoralist conclusion, Woody Allen makes a convential ending for the disappointment of his fans. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem Irracional"" (""The Irrational Man"")"

This was so steeped in wonder and beauty it makes no sense not to only watch this but to study it. This is what happens when a super intellectual who also has the creative touch does research on a topic , uses life, other art anything and disgorges something this affecting and touching that one cannot help but experience the Stendhal Syndrome! I love Woody I wish he was right here right now so If he could get a woody I would pleasure our Lord of Screenplay - wish he actually do much much more in the way of other mediums, just letters, diaries, maybe just jurnals on his thoughts, his ideologies on life on everything and short stories, poetry, novels jokes so much much more all the time!"
" Excellent film for the thinking, analytic viewer
",0.5719,0.9832,2018-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix) is a philosophy professor with equal parts respect and disdain from others in the academic field. He has come to Newport, Rhode Island's smaller Braylin College to begin again in a new setting. But, Prof Lucas still has problems. For one, he drinks too much, startling the lady showing him his faculty housing by offering a flask before ten o'clock in the morning! But, more importantly, his alcoholic tendencies are the symptom of a larger problems: depression and disillusionment with life. What is life's meaning but a long string of broken relationships, natural disasters, petty day-to-day events, etc.? Despite the welcoming of a fellow philosophy professor, Rita (Parker Posey), Abe wants to keep to himself. Yet, when a beautiful student, Jill (Emma Stone), now in her senior year, insists on learning and conversing more with her prof, his icy demeanor begins to thaw. The two fall in love. Then, wonder of wonders, a miracle occurs in Jill's presence. At a local diner, Abe eavesdrops a conversation at the next booth about a divorce court judge ruining the ""good"" parent's existence in a match of wills. Eureka! Abe suddenly finds a new reason to live! What if he, Abe, could rid the world of a person making others miserable and broke? Wouldn't the murder of a colossal despot be the ultimate raison d'etre? He starts hatching plans even as Jill is obliviously to his determination, thinking it a big joke. Then, the judge indeed dies on a park bench. Is Abe responsible? This film is a deep-thinking person's dream, as it spews out philosophy of the world's greatest and those who aspire to be so. As the disenchanted professor, Phoenix is wonderful. Stone and Posey are sharp contrasts and the entire cast is very fine. As for the coastal RI setting, it is magnificent while the costumes are well-chosen. Naturally, however, the biggest acclaim must be given to Allen, whose words and direction are, again, something very, very special in a world of run-of-the-mill movies. Therefore, its entirely rational to run for places where this film is to be had."
" Irrational Man. Wow. Such a movie. An absolutely brilliant film. A delightful masterpiece. 10 / 10
",0.9399,0.992,2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,"Abe (Joaquin Phoenix): ""Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom"".Irrational Man. Wow. Such a movie. A delight for anyone who loves philosophy, especially existentialist philosophy, my favorite!The beginning of the movie is amazing. You can only hear a car and, right after the opening credits, Ramsey Lewis' amazing funky jazz. The first word, pronounced by Joaquin Phoenix, is ""Kant"". Woody Allen seems to have made Irrational Man for philosophy lovers: Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre, Dostoevsky, and Hannah Arendt's thesis dance in this film. Anxiety, despair, the meaning of our existence, choice, morality, suicide, and murder are the film's main themes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is stunning. Really brilliant. Phoenix gained 33 pounds for the role of Abe, a controversial philosophy professor, anguished, depressed and a nihilist who talks to his students about how cruel and frustrating human existence is. Phoenix appears like a man made of blood and flesh, vulnerable and tormented, who prefers to live philosophy than to talk about.I must admit that I am not a big fan of Emma Stone. I find all her performances basically the same. Nevertheless, her performance in Irrational Man is convincing thanks to Woody's amazing writing. Still, she could have bothered herself and take some piano lessons if she was going to play the role of a piano student. Oh, well, those young divas...The other woman is Rita, performed by Parker Posey, an awesome actress. Her performance is fresh, elegant and very real.Ethan Phillips (who played the nasty IRS agent Gorsky in the 90's comedy Green Card) has a small role in the movie and plays Jill's father. I read some negative reviews about Jamie Blackey's performance, who plays Jill's boyfriend, Roy, but truthfully I think that he plays his role to perfection (a simple guy in love, plain and zero exciting).Irrational Man has a bit of Match Point and a lot of Cassandra's Dream, being at the same time original, genuine, and surprising. The end is unpredictable and has a taste of Hitchcock. Woody had already used Crime and Punishment in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point and Cassandra's Dream. Ramsey Lewis (who, I must admit, I didn't know -I have already bought several CDs of his) accompanies us with his amazing funky jazz during all the film. Woody's taste in music is definitely the best.The Adair University (fictitious), where Abe taught before, is the same University that honours Harry Block in Deconstructing Harry and where Sondra Pransky studied journalism in Scoop (how funny).Irrational Man is the last movie produced by Jack Rollins (Woody's producer for over 45 years). Rollins died in 2015, age 100.Abe brings to the extreme the first principle of existentialism: human beings are what we make of ourselves (""l'homme n'est rien d'autre que ce qu'il se fait"", argues Sartre in L'existentialisme est un humanisme). Man is what he decides to be, in complete freedom. Sartre argues that we don't have freedom, but that we are freedom. Our freedom can never be renounced. Even if we decide not to be free, we are deciding in complete freedom not to be free. That's what reflects Sartre's explosive sentence ""l'homme est condamnÃ© Ã  Ãªtre libre""(1). We are free and we are completely responsible of what and who we are. There is no God. We are alone in the Universe. We are the solely owners of our own existence and the only responsible ones for our own choices.Sartrean existentialism is a philosophy of freedom and action. To think about doing something, to hope, to wish, does not count at all for Sartre. Only to act has real value, and Abe knows it. If we wish for somebody to be dead, the only coherent action is murder. But what about morality? Well, are all men worth living? Really cruel people are parasites, are they not? Wouldn't the world be a better place with less parasites?When Abe decides to kill the corrupted judge, his life makes sense again. He starts enjoying life: he has big breakfasts (not only back coffee), is able to make love again, writes poetry again, and feels strong and alive. Suicide is not an option for Abe any more. His life has meaning. His murder plans are what give meaning to his existence.Man is a being in search for meaning. That was brilliantly said by Viktor Frankl in 1946 in his heartbreaking book Man's Search for Meaning (originally written in German and untitled ...trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen. Ein Psychologe erlebt das Konzentrationslager). Frankl's thesis is a yes to life with capital letters. His message: an unconditional faith in the meaning of existence: ""meaning is available under any conditions, even the worst conceivable ones""(2). Life has always meaning, until the end (""life has a meaning to the last breath""(3) and it's our duty to look for this meaning. Our main task is to have to give a meaning to our own existence.Frankl argues that a person who has found the meaning of his life is able to give his life for that meaning, and a person who has not found the meaning of his life can easily commit suicide. At the beginning of the film, Abe suffers from existential vacuum and does not mind at all to die when he demonstrates to his students how to play the Russian roulette. But when he starts planning the murder and finds a meaning for his existence, he rejects suicide and embraces life.Frankl argues that life has always meaning. Sartre, on the contrary, argues that nothing has real meaning: everything is absurd (like Camus). We are alone, without God and without excuses, and we have to carry courageously the emptiness of our human existence.Frankl defines man as freedom, responsibility and meaning. Sartre defines man as freedom, responsibility and anguish. In the first half of Irrational Man, Abe follows Sartre, and, afterwards, follows Frankl. Frankl's thesis is less dark than Sartre's. Nevertheless, I have always found an answer (even if a hard and depressing one) in Sartre's philosophy, and, for what I've read, I think that Woody too.In an interview from 2010, Woody was asked about his vision on life, and said: ""I have a very grim pessimistic view of it. I always had. Since I was a little boy. It hasn't gotten worse with age or anything. I do feel that it's a grim, painful, nightmarish, meaningless experience and that the only way you can be happy is if you tell yourself some lies and deceive yourself (...) One must have one's illusions to live. If you look at life too honestly life does become unbearable because it is a pretty grim enterprise""(4). I agree completely. I think that neither life nor death have real meaning, so we have to create, love and grow as much as we can in order to not to succumb to despair.Irrational Man is an absolutely brilliant film. A delightful masterpiece. 10 / 10The best: the huge dosis of existential philosophy, Joaquin Phoenix's stunning performance, Parker Posey, and Ramsey Lewis' funky jazz.The worst: Emma Stone's perfectly combed hair.Antonia Tejeda Barros, Madrid, August 16, 2018NOTES1.

" Refreshing
",0.0,-0.7996,2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. Phoenix was great in it, his performance was worth the movie; he outshone his less talented co stars. The story is off the wall and kooky, its a story telling piece, its also true that many people are a version of a criminal, at least their inner life even if not played out. I kind of thought there was a jab at the self righteousness of academia in this film also.
One criticism: too much of the same song for a soundtrack, but in general I like a very light touch with music in film.
Also, I don't care who made the film. That should not color your assessment of the work. Much human creativity came from flawed people. A lot of these reviews and even it seems some weak minded actors feel the need to bandwagon and personally attack the director. Weird. Idgaf what the guy did, whats that got to do with being an artist and creating art. Leave the condemnation for a courtroom and just review the show."
" Woody Allen may not remember how humans talk
",0.0,-0.9953,2018-07-16 00:00:00,3,"Allen has surely forgotten how human interaction is meant to work. He pads this film with dialogue that would simply never come out of a human being. The dialogue is so robotic, it's a wonder why he employed actual actors.Not to mention the film has no grounding, happening supposedly over a year but feeling like it takes place over a few days with no signs of characters changing at all.The NEAR CONSTANT referencing of philosophical works is likely meant to sound intelligent, but comes off as pretentious. Ignoring the fact that Emma Stone is a college student who could be no older than 22, she speaks almost entirely in quotes, as if she lacks personality.To make matters worse, the film has a hard time deciding whether or not it wants to be a thriller or the romantic drama we've seen hundreds of times, but done even more poorly.Stone's ""Boyfriend"" appears in approximately 8 scenes, and in most of those, he serves the sole purpose of telling Emma Stone ""shut up about your professor"", but we never see anything else about him as a character. He exists solely to prop up a romantic triangle that doesn't need to be there considering Phoenix has one of his own, which is also ridiculous.Ignoring that, women just throw themselves at potbellied Phoenix, when the man has nearly no actual likeable traits. Stone starts the film saying ""she could have never guessed he'd have anything wrong with him, based on their intial conversation"", which is laughable because in that short scene, all he does is act condescending, and drink publicly.If the movie had stuck to the murder plot, it may have been more interesting but it's only set in motion by exposition robots talking loudly about their problems in a cafe, to move the plot. We don't even see the judge until Phoenix kills him, and at that point, we can't even be sure the judge is that bad of a guy because all we have is Phoenix's word from ""things he looked up on his computer"". We get it, Allen doesn't understand computers. I realize the point of this is that Phoenix would be unknown to him, but the fact that nobody outside of Stone, Phoneix and Posey have any human emotions detracts from the stakes of the film, which there are actual seemingly none. Posey's character is the most problematic. She starts her introduction MID-CONVERSATION with Phoenix, and THEN introduces herself, which is ridiculous. It serves only the purpose of her being able to show how much of a sad sack Phoenix is, as she almost disappears from the movie as a whole for most of it, not addressing the fact she'd been publicly cheating on her husband or any of that.Aside from all that, possibly the most irrational point I'll make: Stone casually learns of the fact Phoenix might have commited murder from a ""friend"", which likely means more people know, but that isn't my point. The conversation seems so forced, then they're just like ""should we go ride horses"", casually, and are able to do so within seconds, and Stone looks like someone killed her grandmother the entire time. I genuinely believe Allen has forgotten how to make human connections or converse with people, because this whole movie seems like some robots talking in philosphy quotes for over an hour."

I started to hate Emma's character--she was mean to her boyfriend before dumping him for Abe, then becomes morally outraged when she finds out Abe killed a dishonest judge whom Jill hated for making life miserable for this woman whose conversation they over heard at a diner. I wanted both Abe and Jill to go down that elevator shaft. A total bummer of an ending."

" a hurried job
",0.0,-0.6333,2017-11-30 00:00:00,3,"On the plus side, this is a nice idea. If philosophy & classics (Dostoevsky) is something you haven't bothered with so far, then this may be nice because it's a quick summary. Unfortunately, it feels like the script was then written in a hurry and not proofread by anyone. The philosophy side of things is shallow and predictable, the cheesy chirpy music every time something 'profound' happens is irritating, and Emma Stone's voice overs are uncomfortably scripted. The characters start off interesting, but then become standard at the end.And to top off, as a Woody Allen movie, it starts to feel a bit gross when he has a guy ignoring the woman of his own age and going for the young girl instead (despite first saying 'I won't go for you because it's not appropriate because you're too young')."

He initially hopes to keep their relationship casual, that is until the thought of doing society a favor--eliminating someone with a worse reputation than his--comes to mind, which brightens his outlook and gives him the impetus to date and enjoy life for the first time. Fine Woody Allen drama, well-acted yet rife with the writer-director's familiar crimes-and-misdemeanors (with a tip of the hat to Dostoevsky). The teacher-student affair is another Allen-trademark, though Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone are subtly charismatic in these roles. Still, nothing much seems to happen in the first 45 minutes (Allen takes too much time kick-starting the plot) and the general cast of characters here is very small. Allen uses a jazzy rendition of ""The 'In' Crowd"" as a music motif, and doesn't rely too much on sex or sex talk to spark his narrative, though one does become impatient with Phoenix's teacher, who justifies his actions again and again--first in a voice-over and then to Stone, for whom his feelings are never really made clear. **1/2 from ****"
" Woody Allen Leads Viewers By The Hand Through A Sterile, Predictable Crisis
",-0.2263,0.9639,2017-08-21 00:00:00,5,"Surfing through the channels, I found this film, which I had never heard of before. When I saw that Emma Stone is in the cast, I decided to check it out.The number of voice-overs was a possible distraction. After about ten minutes, Joacquin Phoenix's internal thoughts reminded me of a Woody Allen voice-over. And it occurred to me that I would actually enjoy it more if Woody was the actor playing that part. Of course I discovered--on checking--that Woody was indeed the writer and director of the film.Joaquin Phoenix plays Abe Lucas, a college professor overcome by impotence in a broad sense of the word. His philosophical musings lead to an emotional breakthrough that frees him from societal norms and his neurotic nebbishness.As the story develops, it is obvious that his actions will lead to unforeseen (by him) consequences. Viewers are, of course, ahead of the curve. Abe thinks he is Hemingway, a man who takes action, but he is really Robert Walker from ""Strangers on a Train"", celebrating his warped view of life. Allen borrows from that film and also from Hitchcock's ""Rope"". There is a moral sterility in the outcome. And the jazz soundtrack feels inappropriately celebratory in many sections of the film.The film's basic message--that if you trust your instincts without deferring to the rational mind, the results are unpredictable--is fine. It's just that its delivery that falls short. And the plot includes some unnecessarily neat coincidences."
" Irrational Man
",-0.34,0.9873,2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Woody Allen exchanged his trademark jazz opening to a quote from one of my favorite philosophers for his title credit sequence. ""Kant said human reason is troubled by questions it cannot dismiss, but also cannot answer."" spoke Joaquin Phoenix while driving. Woody Allen's 2015 film, Irrational Man, brought the writer/director back to America, but not back to New York. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone, Irrational Man follows a philosophy professor who determines that the only way to give his life meaning is to take a decisive action, despite the moral consequences. Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix) is the newest addition to the philosophy department of a small town campus in Rhode Island. Abe, who once was an idealist and is now certain of his inability to change the world, has a reputation that precedes him. Most of the student and the faculty have heard a whole host of rumors before they ever even see Abe. Once he arrives, any remaining delusions of grandeur unceremoniously disappear. Quickly revealing himself as an alcoholic, even carrying a flask around with him on campus, it is clear Abe lives his life with a deflated ego and an extreme case of nihilism. His many quibbles with the world and his profession keep Abe from being an effective professor, or an acceptable romantic partner. Despite his many downfalls and ego issues, Abe becomes the object of desire for one of his students, Jill Pollard (Emma Stone). Jill is filled with life; she is a good student, a devoted daughter, and a loyal girlfriend until she meets Abe. A standout writer, Jill focuses her talents on her philosophy coursework, captivated by the person teaching as much as what's being taught. Jill can't help herself from falling in love with Abe, leading her to spend as much time with him as she can. Their trysts lead them to a cafe wherein they hear the conversation of a distraught woman sharing her feelings of despair over a judge she perceives as treating her unfairly. Suddenly, Abe secretly decides that the only way to give his life meaning is to end the life of another.Much like Match Point, Irrational Man didn't ""feel"" as much like a Woody Allen film as I am used to. The problem is, that this film also didn't work as well as Match Point pulled off its ""non-Woody feel"". There are a lot of problems with Irrational Man, many I suppose must be forgiven by the title. The conversation that acts as the turning point for Abe is a weak plot device. There's no way we can discern if the woman is reliable or if her perception of the events are true, it seems unlikely from all we know about Abe that he would derive pleasure from bringing a stranger happiness, either. The film painstakingly paints Abe as a man that can't commit to those he wishes he could, yet I am supposed to believe that he's willing to invest interest in a complete stranger, then, risk his life for her? The setup was problematic, and it was a bit more problematic for me to believe that a person Woody Allen wants me to know is horrible has two women wishing to romance him. I've mentioned before, this period where Woody seems preoccupied with getting away with murder just doesn't do it for me. The film isn't without its strengths; the Russian roulette scene was fantastic, and the ending was incredible, maybe more so because I don't expect such powerful endings from Woody Allen. This was the final late-period Woody Allen film I had left to see and I hope beyond hope that he's done with this murder plot he's been after the last few films."
" A waste of space
",-0.4215,0.8712,2017-07-04 00:00:00,5,"Woody Allens mind is a maze of thought, philosophy, morality, and wisdom. Once upon a time he was able to channel all of that into movies that were a thing of love. Now he merely makes movies of contemplation. A suicidal misanthropic philosophy professor played by Phoenix finds a motive for living by committing a murder which he believes is a service to humanity. He plots to poison a crooked judge after over hearing a story in a diner of a divorced mother who is on the receiving end of his judicial abuse of power. Meanwhile he is dating one of his students (Emma Stone), and eventually he is going to have to spill the beans of his crime.The central morality question that is at the heart of this story is intriguing, but the translation is very poor. The whole film is bogged down by repetitive narration which highlights pretty much exactly what we see on screen as it is being said, over and over again. As far as acting goes, the feeling of investment is lacking. Phoenix does his best to summon his mix of humanity and de humanity and often rises to the occasion. Emma Stone brings straight girl realism but none of the charm or sly that defines her better performances. The ending feels rushed but offers the happiest resolution possible given the circumstances. What the movie really needs is a reason for being. It is too much staring into empty space while listening to over exposition. The movie is an overlong train of thought that gives a detailed explanation of virtually nothing."
" Confort narrative zone and any new proposal on Woody's Irrational Man
",-0.34,-0.2761,2017-05-31 00:00:00,3,"Woody, once again, seems to be in a comfort area, which we are all tired of. We have seen, with this time, three times the same movie. At the end, the only reflection one can make is that he is making of himself a clichÃ©, from every point of view. I will disagree to call this sequences a Trilogy or something similar, but a creative stagnation. With Match Point we watch a dramatic and delicate movie that evokes directly Dostoievski's Crime and Punishment, being a bit dangerous since Dostoievski is an overused topic to make things look more obscure and deeper. We had a second experience on screen about the same topic with CassandraÃ¡ Dream, without any additional or richer analytical purpose. The fresh air came with a comedy that focuses on the good side of the story, not anymore on the disturbed mind. Still, everything started to be boring since then. Now, we had with Irrational Man, a very good cast on screen, however any new inflection. He is becoming in a suffocating agent. I have to admit that Blue Jasmin and You Will Meet a Talk Dark Stranger were enjoyable since empathy attacks immediately the audience with this pathetic, bizarre and intimate protagonist. That could be an interesting narrative line to follow for Allen, so we still could believe that his sense of humor is accurate and binding, without dropping himself into this ""philosophical lucubrations""."
" Solid Woody rational offering!
",0.2244,-0.5715,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Woody! Woody! Woody! Not the most rational humanoid that ever existed, but one thing about legendary filmmaker Woody Allen you have to admit is that his ratio of movies per year is phenomenal- 1/1; yes, one movie per year. Allen's ""Irrational Man"" stars the not-so-rational actor himself Joaquin Phoenix as Abe Lucas, an alcoholic Philosophy professor who joins up as an adjunct professor at a Connecticut university. Abe has lost lust for life and is very uninspired. At the university, he meets several key players including a Science professor colleague named Rita Richards who lusts for Abe even though she is married. Abe also befriends one of his students named Jill Pollard who admires Abe and this Pollard also wants to pollute Abe's college morals, or lack there of. Allen directs and scribes ""Irrational Man"" quite well with infamous Woodyisms such as insecurity, jealousy, anxiety, and delirium. And even though it is not one of his classic movies, ""Irrational Man"" rationalizes itself as a pleasant, quirky viewing. Phoenix shines as Abe. Emma Stone was very good as Pollard, and the very underrated Parker Posey stuck her pleasant thespian pose as Richards. So come one man, give that ""Irrational Man"" a try. **** Good"
" Philosophy 101
",0.0,0.7335,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Very good addition to Woody Allen's filmography. Thoughtful, intelligent movie unlike anything Hollywood churns out these days. Woody's fingerprints are all over this one and you can just hear him typing away every time the characters speak. Performances are good (not necessarily great). Look for Bette Midler's daughter in a small role. Santo Loquasto's set design and Rhode Island location photography are idyllic. Compared to Allen's other great morality plays (Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point, Cassandra's Dream), this one seems a bit over-emphatic, though it remains intriguing and satisfying throughout. There are even several Hitchcock touches thrown in - the unrelated murder from ""Strangers on a Train,"" the philosophical aspects of murder from ""Rope"" and the final struggle between good and evil from ""Shadow of a Doubt."" Especially noteworthy are the classroom lectures which question the validity of classic philosophical thought."

",0.2975,0.9867,2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Another tick in the box for a Woody Allen film you can like. Not quite a classic but it has its moments and the leads are as good as the are in anything else. In terms of being a comedy, this is not going to make you laugh out loud - its more of a Woody Allen knowing smirk that stays with you throughout. Naturally it is smart, neurotic and melancholy. It plays like Crimes and Misdemeanours lite. So if you liked that one (and why wouldn't you? That one is a classic) then definitely give this a go. Perhaps most interesting as part of the journey leading Emma Stone from Superbad and The House Bunny less than ten years ago to Oscar glory in 2017."
" A painful lesson
",-0.4404,0.7665,2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Maybe the lesson is that you can't make one movie per year and expect them to be all top notch. Although some will be brilliant, many will flunk, and some others will be massive failures, it's pure statistics. Unfortunately, this one sits strongly in the latter category. Even when he is not at the top of his game, Woody Allen manages to make movies that are entertaining, passable or at least watchable. Not this one. After 95 minutes of the first bars of ""The In Crowd"" repeated endlessly, it is a relief to get to the end titles. Many other reviewers have already pointed out the paper thin, miscast characters, the non-existent script or the laughable cop-out ending. But it gets worse, this movie fails even at technical aspects, which has usually been one of Woody Allen's strong suits. Awfully lit, badly framed scenes and appalling photography contribute to make this a very sad and painful cinematic experience.One can't fail to notice how Woody's stories have evolved over the course of his directing career from being set in working class Brooklyn to the ultra-rich one percenters in The Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard. Not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact, that is probably the trajectory that Woody Allen's life itself has followed. The problem is that while his previous characters were usually quite likable quirky simpletons or neurotic intellectuals, they have now become unbearably spoiled, cartoonish, vacuous and pretentious ivy leaguers. Who can possibly like, or even feel the slightest interest for such despicable people? I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do with their affluent lifestyle; you can make strong, interesting characters out of billionaires. The Great Gatsby being a case in point. Will still watch a Woody Allen movie over a blockbuster any day, and I hope he continues making them for many years. But Irrational Man was a terrible misfire which does him no honor - skip it and you will be missing nothing."
" 'Irrational Man' is surprisingly 'just O.K' for a Woody Allen movie...
",-0.0516,0.9698,2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"It's obvious five minutes into 'Irrational Man' that it has that 'Woody Allen feel', not surprising since he both wrote the screenplay for and directed this 2015 film. Ironically, having an actor similar to Woody Allen was what was needed to make this movie go from just passable to really great ~ perhaps someone like the quirky Owen Wilson playing the lead role of Abe Lucas instead of Joaquin Phoenix. Quite frankly, nobody does fractured characters better than the great Woody Allen, but it would have been incredibly creepy seeing him have a sexual relationship on screen now at the age of 80.As well, I think Wilson would have played opposite college student Jillian ""Jill"" Pollard (Emma Stone) much better than Phoenix did. I never sensed any real chemistry between the two ~ just Stone trying desperately to carry all of their awkward scenes together. As the plot grew increasingly dark, it needed someone with Woody Allen's brilliant timing and inflections to make the scenes jump off the screen, and not the mundane offerings of the non-dimensional Phoenix.All in all, 'Irrational Man' was not great, but not terrible either. It's a pity that Allen was too old to be both behind the cameras AND in front of them for this somewhat forgettable flick. 6* out of 10."
" Woody Allen's relecture of some Hitchcock's
",0.0,0.7114,2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"The plot is highly relatable to Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""Rope"". I hope that you can get the references, for it's funny once you realize that.Of course, it comes with the already expected woodyallenien soundtrack, background philosophy theories and, as if there could be a Woody Allen's without it, charm. It's ironic and morally intriguing. The great thinkers's thoughts laid all through the film are a nice presence.It's worth your time to watch, but don't expect much. It's not one of the director's gems."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9773,2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"OK, I get where the negative reviewers are coming from--the plot seemed formulaic at times. That being said, Allen executes it well and manages to make it seem fresh. I was taken completely by surprise by much of the film. I love Joaquin Phoenix, even more-so after this movie. Wow.Also, as someone who enjoys literature and philosophy, the quotes thrown into the script were great; one of my favorites was ""in order to really see the world, we must break with our familiar acceptance of it"". This made me pause the movie and look up the quote's author (Merleau-Ponty), and any movie that makes you think and learn new things like that is surely worthwhile.Give it a chance. I almost didn't watch it, but am sure glad I did.Honestly, one of my new favorite movies."
" Another example of the ""Wooden Allen Method"" of acting
",0.0,0.9975,2017-01-30 00:00:00,4,"I have always enjoyed the classic (and dare I say ""original"") Woody Allen movies that he produced in his early career. Over the years, they have become a series of hit-and-miss films whose only claim to fame is its director and the all-star cast he still manages to attract. I haven't heard of most of them, but when I stumble across one on Netflix, I know it's an Allen movie the moment one of the characters begins to speak.I don't understand how Allen manages to take a very disparate group of actors with different styles and techniques and somehow make them all sound the same. I call it the ""Wooden Allen Method"" (or ""Syndrome"", in the cases of the actors who appear in more than one of his films.) All of his actors become infected with an inauthentic, earnest intellectualism and speak their lines with the same stuttering, sighing angst. There have been exceptions, of course, as in the case of Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, but in general every Allen ingenue sounds like every other ingenue, and every world-weary professor/huckster sounds the same, and the ingenues and professors always seem to end up ""falling in love"" and into bed together. Spare me. It is such a transparent conceit of a man past his prime to think that every gifted, beautiful young woman is frothing at the bit to bed his pot-bellied, greasy-haired self. The love stories in Allen films are rarely convincing, and weaken the overall trajectory of the movie. Let's all pause for a few moments and watch while a Beautiful Young Thing rolls around in ecstasy with a Withered Old Thing.The one sparkling exception however, was Parker Posey whose natural energy, and ebullience informed her small role with realism and humanity. I would love to see more of her in films that showcase her intelligence, wit and vivacity. She is maturing into a very fine actress.Overall, it's an alright movie; a passing indulgence of a long winter's eve. The location is beautiful, the story is interesting, and production value is sound."
" Rational Man.
",0.0,-0.701,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Taking a look at votes on the poll for the best cast and film of 2016 on IMDb's Classic Film board,I noticed a number of mentions for cast members in Woody Allen's CafÃ© Society. Originally planning to pick up Society,I was happily caught by surprise,when a family friend revealed that he had picked up Allen's 2015 title,which led to me getting set to find out how irrational this man could be.The plot:Caught in an existential crisis, philosophy professor Abe Lucas spends all the lessons he teaches half drunk.Despite Lucas stinking of booze,student Jill Pollard finds herself falling for Lucas's world view. Aware of a ban on tutors going out with students,Lucas and Pollard decide to keep their relationship secret. Going out for lunch with Pollard one day,Lucas hears a conversation about a women fearing that a judge will take her kids away in a custody battle. Knowing who the judge is,Lucas starts to think about doing something deadly irrational.View on the film:Gaining 33 pounds for the role, Joaquin Phoenix gives Lucas a very good heaviness,as his sluggish manner pulls the existential crisis weighing down on Lucas. Spending the first half trying to find answers from a bottle, Phoenix slurs the dialogue,which whilst fitting with Lucas's state does cause possible zingers in Allen's script to end up on a jumbled,badly mumbled mess. Crossing the same wave length as Lucas,the cute Emma Stone gives a sparkling performance as Pollard,with Stone delivering Allen's quirky lines with a smooth flow and also crystallising Pollard's own existential crisis on Lucas's actions.Opening the pages of Crime and Punishment again,the screenplay by writer/director Woody Allen loops comedic philosophy with a simmering Drama. Giving the early days of Pollard and Lucas's relationship a free spirited feel,Allen gives the dialogue a playfulness that highlights the philosophy that the relationship is built on. While Phoenix's performance takes some of the charm out of the title,Allen displays a sharp eye for stirring Lucas's consideration of taking an existential walk on the wild,as Pollard finds her lover gripped by the philosophy of an irrational man."
" such a lame movie with seriously strange funny dialogue
",-0.34,0.7694,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"after seeing one woody Allen movie a few years back, I was pretty sure that I would want to see more of his stuff. when cafÃ© society came out, I thought naw, uh uh i'll skip this one...for some reason I even got this notion that ANDY DICK had taken over responsibility for woody Allen and all would be parody. but that's dumb huh. so when this film was released or leaked to the public, I was all like, wow! Joaquin phoenix and parker posey? this has got to be good. Turns out that this film stinks. Joaquin is a drunk professor that slowly starts hanging out with Emma stone more than she does with her own boyfriend. I don't know whats going on with Emma stone, but the last film I saw her in BIRdMAN, was exactly just like this one.. I walk out thinking what a bogus movie! but overnight and the next few days some kind of rewind and review of the film lifts my spirits with some stuff I'm pretty certain I didn't just see or hear in the movie. so here we go...parker posey...all plain and lame requiring apologies for another pretend situation amongst the Giselle bundchkin and tom Brady love life...it seems there are phrases about mattresses and tampax the Armani exchange and Europe being a synonym for your up...that just had me in awe... but where the ploy sucks a bunch is how inspired the drunk professor becomes eavesdropping in a diner with his pupil or student or friend Emma stone...and then as the story unfolds in a hallway with an elevator? WTF! almost like some murder she wrote or Perry mason episode...."
" Below average Woody Allen
",0.0,0.7178,2017-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Since 'Midnight in Paris' Woody Allen's films have grown a bit, and earnt him newfound acclaim.His 2015 film 'Irrational Man' though isn't that good, which is frustrating because it should be. It should be great actually.But the plot never really gets going, the characters not strong enough to fully hook me in, so it becomes an average film rather than a good one.Emma Stone is the best thing in it, and dazzles in every scene. It's no surprise that Allen, who always has gravitated towards bright young talent, because she certainly displays her ability here.Not one of Allen's best, but then again, his standards are high."
