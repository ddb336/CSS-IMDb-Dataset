" Almost great
",0.5868,-0.5031,2020-11-09 00:00:00,2,I was enjoying the movie until the scene (1:16:32) where he was putting lit matches through the key hole and they just watched on the other side of a locked door in fear as the matches lit the paint thinner that they had so many chances to move instead of just watching and waiting. I turned it off and didn't watch the rest. WTF Tim?
" A Keane Eye for Art
",0.0,0.875,2020-10-29 00:00:00,6,"An uncertain mixture of drama and comedy (such as the scene where Christoph Waltz interrogates himself in the witness box like Everett Sloane in 'The Lady from Shanghai').The resemblance of 'Big Eyes' to the Tony Hancock vehicle 'The Rebel' seems to have been noticed by even fewer people than that of 'Basic Instinct' to 'Play Misty to Me' (with Danny Huston performing a function similar to George Sanders in the earlier film). Except that in 'Big Eyes' it's as if the struggling artist played by Paul Massie found fame and fortune by laying claim to the authorship of the daubs of Anthony Hancock.Since you won't find either Keane in any of the usual art histories, the decision in 1986 of Margaret to take Walter to court was presumably motivated by the prices their paintings were commanding rather than hurt creative pride. (Significantly Andy Warhol was a fan.)"
" Not a typical Tim Burton film
",0.0,0.9788,2020-10-15 00:00:00,6,"A definite departure from your average Tim Burton fantasy feature, and story is quite frustrating, but oddly, I still enjoyed it. I was happy with the final conclusion and let out a sigh of relief. Acting was just average. If you love stories about real life artists, I would absolutely watch this. It's not Frida, Pollock, or At Eternity's Gate, but still fun to watch with a microwave bag of popcorn."
" Immy's review : Has it's problems
",-0.4019,0.9696,2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"'Big eyes' is a worthy attempt at portraying the rather sad life of Margaret Keane and the constant lies and deceit she experienced in the face of her narcissistic husband. It was enjoyable for the most part, but it was nothing more. There was nothing particularly memorable or spectacular about it. I feel like there was room for more emotional complexity or authenticity, which it did lack. It felt maybe a little too polished and shallow to be considered truly masterful. None the less, it's still an entertaining movie with grand performances, most notably from our two leads. Christopher Waltz was very colourful and expressive with his role, helping bring his crazy, psychologically complex character to life. I also thought Amy Adam's performance was very genuine. At times, the movie lacked direction and consistency. It didn't know whether it wanted to be a drama, a comedy or a light biography. For example, the court scene felt more like a comedy and as funny as it was, it didn't fit in with the tone at the time. There was also a narrator at the beginning, who suddenly vanished only to pop back into the picture much later on in the movie, making him completely irrelevant in the first place. Although the film has many problems, it's still an enjoyable watch to pass the time. It's just nothing special."

" Masterfully acted
",0.0,0.9251,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"I really loved the performances here, especially Waltz who plays the deceptively smooth husband. Although this is far from Tim Burton's usual style, it is one of his best films. He should make more films like this."
" Typical early 1960's white middleclass domestic abuse
",-0.6369,0.6275,2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Whatever the facts of the story, 'Big Eyes' is, until the tedious last act courtroom drama, a very engaging depiction of, well, typical 1960's white middleclass domestic abuse.A woman who's not a bad painter technically, conspires (involuntarily) with her rebound husband to promote her paintings of (presumably emotionally abused) children as HIS work.Ultimately, she has to assert her ownership of the work.It's still mediocre art, but the female empowerment is first class."
" Brilliantly well made film with great performances
",0.8807,0.9904,2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Tim's second biopic film focuses on painter Margaret Keane (played by Amy Adams) and her complicated introduction to the art world despite her amazing talent. After meeting her husband Walter (Christopher Waltz) he wrangles his way into taking credit for her works in order to make money. The film details this particular period as well as the legal battles that ensued in the 1960s between both parties. Adams portrays Margaret with all the respect and empathy she deserved for this difficult time in her life and Waltz does an excellent portrayal of a charming yet odious man. The story does take very dark turns and they're directed with such a straight forward edge that is surprising from a director who is most well known for his fantastical side. I believe I read somewhere (correct me if I'm wrong!) that Burton has mentioned how this was one of the easiest shoots he's been involved in and therefore enjoyed himself immensely which is really cool to hear; it's lovely after some stressful shoots in the past and multi-million productions such as Alice that he can lay back and still produce awesome work without the stress. With fantastic locations and keen period detail, Big Eyes was my introduction to Margaret and her work and her paintings are really something special"
" Inspiring
",0.4215,0.9605,2020-02-23 00:00:00,7,"This was actually ... not bad? I expected another Burton modern dogsh** (not Sweeney Todd and Big Fish) but actually this was fine. Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz were both great and I loved Waltz's performance in the courtroom. Big Eyes paintings look like Burton made them himself, maybe Burton's wife is a genius behind his movies, at least behind the early ones."
" Interesting drama about the Keane scandal
",-0.0516,0.988,2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"An insecure divorcee with one child tries to earn a modest living by painting. Whether she's talented or not is a matter of opinion, but at least she's true to her own taste and sensibility. She's especially fond of painting portraits of children - mainly sad-faced waifs - with huge eyes. Having met and married another artist, she soon discovers that her smart, glib, smooth-talking husband can sell just about anything, including her own paintings. Before long her big-eyed waifs are the talk of the town. However, her husband consistently claims her work as his own...""Big eyes"" is a drama based on a real-life scandal which shook the American art world to its core : it turned out that a hugely popular artist, one Walter Keane, had gained his fortune by stealing his wife's work and turning her into a modern-day slave. Moreover, he had done so in broad daylight, giving interviews to journalists, pontificating to critics and hanging out with celebrities. He had even made a present of some of the paintings to foreign leaders and ambassadors, with the appropriate pomp and ceremony. At least a number of people such as critics, museum directors, gallery owners, bankers,... should have asked some very basic questions, like ""could I watch you paint for a bit ?"" or ""could you tell me more about the technical aspects of your craft ?""And then of course there was the dubious quality of the paintings themselves - how on earth had these achieved such fame, such popularity, such omnipresence ?So the subject matter of ""Big Eyes"" is certainly interesting, from a cultural and societal point of view ; it is also pretty weird and whacky. On a more intimate level, the movie also functions as a psychological portrayal of a deeply dysfunctional marriage between a reasonably sane, reasonably inoffensive woman and a domineering manipulator with mental problems. It's the kind of relationship where one partner is a tree, and the other partner is a strangler fig bent on imprisoning, suffocating and, eventually, replacing that very tree...I liked the movie well enough, although it seemed to lose some of its power and impact somewhere around the 5/6th mark. Still, it's a carefully made and well-acted movie that succeeds in telling a clear and comprehensible story about a VERY strange episode in modern American history."
" glamour and fraud, art and kitsch
",-0.1027,0.998,2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"'Big Eyes' is an unusual film from many points of view. We are dealing with a story that takes place in the world of American art from the second half of the 20th century, a story inspired by real biographies and true facts, but the hero and heroine of the story, although famous, are not part of the consecrated names of the painters of the time, nor among the artists exhibited in the great museums. On the contrary, most critics and art experts consider Keane's signed works as belonging to commercial kitsch, but that has not prevented them from being sold well and mass-produced, bringing to the authors beautiful incomes. However, the celebrity of the name Keane derives from the public scandal of the disclosure that for over a decade Walter Keane has assumed the paternity of the successful paintings created by his wife Margaret, and from the dispute between them that ended to court and was decided through a test of creativity carried out in the presence of the jurors. The feminist theme of critical appreciation and commercial success of women in the art world is combined with the one of the relationship between the kitsch appreciated by a large part of the public and the art exhibited and sold in galleries and praised by critics. Tim Burton worked at this film for more than a decade, and the result has an imperfection that makes viewers constantly wonder whether it is intentional or not.Walter Keane broke in the art world in the late 1950s with a series of portraits, most of them depicting children, with an air of melancholy mirrored in their obsessively big eyes. In that artistic era in which abstract expressionism was fashionable, critics turned their backs, but the success with the public was almost immediate, Keane, a real estate agent originally being an excellent expert in 'public relations' and a skillful salesman for his own art. The problem, however, was that this art was not created by him but by his wife Margaret Keane. The truth, which included fraud and a sordid story of domestic violence, came to light a few years later, when Margaret, separated from her husband and having fallen under the influence of the 'Jehovah's Witnesses' religious cult, brought it up to public notice. The scandal also reached the courts, raising question marks not only about the case in question (to which the creations belonged) but also about the reasons that made the woman artist collaborate on the fraud. Would the paintings have been equally successful if they were signed by a woman? What is the place and what are the chances of success of a woman in the world of art?Cinematography is what I liked the most, which should not be surprising for a Tim Burton movie. The pastel colors and the sets have am air of superficial happiness, in tune with the kitsch atmosphere of the paintings around which the action revolves. Naive art or kitsch? We are left to decide. The main roles are played by Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, both excellent actors, but here they do just two OK roles and they do not look at their best. This impression is created, perhaps, by the fact that the biographical story, based on real life persons, was written in a simplistic and conventional style, putting too often the characters in situations when they act and speak exactly as we expected. Maybe Tim Burton, subtly, intended to tell us that a story about kitsch art can be told in the style of kitsch film? However, the script of the film enjoyed the approval of the artist who is the main heroine. In addition, the film has a strong feminist focus. Do you know which company is the first to appear generically as a producer of the film? Weinstein Company! The history of cinema sometimes takes unexpected turns."
" Unfortunately, the miscasting of a key role in 'Big Eyes' makes many scenes appear unreal.
",-0.34,0.7088,2019-11-18 00:00:00,7,"If I were to speculate about what happened behind the scenes when they made this, it felt as if Tim Burton was given a sort of a dare: ""you couldn't make a regular film if you tried!"" and that this film was the answer to that challenge. Adams and Waltz seem to endeavor to stretch beyond the Movie-Of-The-Week limitations in place but fail, kitsch ultimately winning out over sentimentality. It's a generic film, surprisingly so."
" Great storyline and was very entertaining

" A blow on masculine fraud
",-0.5859,0.8619,2019-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Tim Burton, whom we are mostly familiar to his fantastic works, pictures a biographic story; Margaret Keane and his husband Walter Keane's art lives.Walter misleads all the world as if he is the painter of famous picture series called ""Big Eyes"" which have belonged to Margaret, in fact; by dominating and convincing his wife with social norms and masculinity.This is a true story!! Burton, pictures this story by his original storytelling style and dark-comedic narration and gifts a meaningful contribution to survival against conscious ignorance to women's roles in various context of history.Should be seen."

" Burton, restrained.
",0.0,0.6965,2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"A great piece that was actually pretty visually tame by Tim Burton's standards (although the hallucinations definitely had his style). What's probably most interesting about this film is that, while I agree the art is kitschy, the con-artist angle of it really drives home the fact that artists, be they painters or writers, really need to be showmen in order to truly have their work succeed. It's sad that women were oppressed during this time period, but it really wasn't that long ago. After all, most artists aren't too interested in the money, they just want recognition for their work."
" ""Mother, I know...""
",0.0,0.8564,2019-04-06 00:00:00,10,"The Warhol quote is making fun of its ghastliness and the invisible hand of the market. An odd choice to start on by mocking its own subject. As well I sense a subconscious undercurrent reflecting his own brand.But the key to Tim Burton has always been Disney not Gothic. Here is finally a proper Gothic work in being everything but, with its colorful San Francisco and Hawaii; Waltz through structures of mental control, abuse in power, serial plagiarizing, is a Gothic monster.There would be inheritances in stories like this.But it's about speech as well and how if you don't say it it'll never be said, begging the tragedy how painting isn't enough. Her eyes don't just see but can't not see. They gaze the heightened details of the world. Then would be susceptible to larger than life psychologies which would entice her in love. A Gothic torture how love controls her. Then when images can't be hers, she chooses numbers. Numerology in the pop 60s make her almost a chosen one for backing the zeitgeist: late 20th century advanced statistics would forecast and streamline every single industry. Her drawings very much forecasted the medium of anime, which rivals all of world cinema. By her own devices left unchecked might've lead to some great garage start-up, Mac, PC... Keane. In all seriousness societal mechanics denying her ability to grow in art reminds me of Burton himself trapped in the machine of his brand.Credit. Silence. Eyes. Its elements fuse a true fright. ""Mother, I know..."" Few will know the soul-crushing abuse of others taking credit for their work.Usually, a woman so pretty would not be a Tim Burton outsider but the spark of her ghoulish secret drawings make her as him. Oddest. The whole film is about these demonic traumatized orphans happening in its background. A battlefield seems to be the anger as the commodification of western privilege. But against the abstract expressionist backdrop it's a valid contrary.Most beautiful is it's this Tim Burton art film where performers are allowed to act not pose, even though it abuses green screen (its artifice you could say is Warholian at least...); much is said about the overacting, where Waltz has to strut around and make a great show of it, but he's being watched by Burton and Keane's; eyes so big warrant big visions."
" Not your typical Tim Burton that's for sure
",0.3182,0.9867,2019-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Tim Burton is known for his dark visuals and odd movie choices. He has also followed a pattern for a while now as far as casting and soundtrack selection(Danny Elfman) goes. This can be a problem, but luckily, Tim has chosen to do something less expected with this one.It is refreshing to see a well recognized director take risks. Especially when the results are satisfying and not dissapointing. By looking at the trailer, I would of never guessed that this movie would be so enjoyable in a non-creepy way. I am glad that someone recommended this to me because if not, I doubt I would of ever had any interest in it. This goes to show that Tim Burton does well in and outside his eerie box of strangeness.If you would like to see a toned down, less gothicy vision from Burton, Big Eyes is a good choice."
" Soooooo good!
",0.4926,0.9695,2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Thank you to the amazing acting by these two. I had a total blast watching them. The story is so interesting and the directing kept me glued to the screen wanting to know what comes next. I totally enjoyed every scene and the director definitely knew what he was doing, saving the best for last. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Great work guys!"
" It's good, but not great.
",-0.5409,0.9656,2019-01-17 00:00:00,6,"This is a fascinating story which should make for a fantastic movie, but instead it's just ok. Entertaining, but nothing truly special. The worst part is that there are hints of something more interesting underneath, like when Margaret sees people with abnormally large eyes in the supermarket or big eyes in her own reflection. We wonder how these paintings are affecting her identity, because in a way they are all she is, but she can't claim them as hers. But that idea is just kind of... left there.And then there's the main problem: Christoph Waltz. He's not the only one at fault - his character goes from charming to cartoon villain which can certainly be blamed on the writers and Burton - but his over acted performance, particularly towards the end, completely obscured any depth that Walter's character may have had.Amy Adams, on the other hand, is fantastic and certainly the movie's saving grace. I would have liked to see more of her relationship with Walter, more of what made her willing to keep cranking out paintings for her husband, though I suspect a more three-dimensional Walter would have been needed for that.And the narrator/reporter was completely unnecessary. I kept forgetting he existed and then wondering who was talking for a few seconds before I remembered that the movie had a narrator.All in all, entertaining but disappointing. 6/10"
" A Sweet Untold Story
",0.4588,0.9847,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"27 January 2017. It's hard to judge a movie when the topic of the movie is, in part, about artistic quality itself. Is the art displayed in this movie great art or not? In some ways, the commercialization and popularity of mass public dictation of art as presented in this movie can be distracting to the more intriguing and powerful issue of intimate relationships around which this movie is primarily centered. With grand strokes, Amy Adams takes on the relatively unknown backstory to a truly ""cute"" big eye artistic technique that is now seemingly found everywhere in every store in America. What she experiences in the 1950s and 1960s in terms of women's rights and dignity is as relevant as the civil right movement of the times. And with today's racial issues still simmering today, the concept of power and domination still resonant today.The portrayal of Margaret Keane is an eye opening and told in magnificent brush strokes with close attention to a color palette. The director has managed to incorporate in lightness even within the emerging darkness of the storyline. Somehow the movie is sustained by the sad big eyes and the real-world response to the sparkling popularity of the emotion-laden products that seemingly permeate American society. There is initially hope then growing anger and frustration dripping from the storyline and yet based on a secure foundation that this is a movie about a hidden strength and personal integrity to be found and revealed to the world.Big Eyes is actual simple in its true to life concept and yet told in a way that is emotional riveting, maintaining a strong sense of the story to be told."

" ""From now on, we're one and the same.""
",0.0,0.8977,2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The most amazing thing to learn about the massive fraud perpetrated by Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) was that he did it right out in the open, with no attempt (at least later on) to hide the fact from his wife Margaret (Amy Adams). As the story progressed, I found myself getting irritated that Margaret kept going along with the masquerade, especially when he was getting all the credit, appearing on television, and hobnobbing with celebrities like Bob Hope, Red Skelton and Johnny Carson. The story is as much about Margaret's inferiority complex and inability to stand up for herself as it is about Walter's massive ego and need to be stroked at every gallery exhibit and museum unveiling. You have to hand it to both Waltz and Adams for their portrayals, their regard for each other is masterfully handled under the direction of Tim Burton. It's kind of ironic that Burton directs this kind of caricature about a phony artist when a lot of the work that has gained him prominence are of caricatures themselves. And to top it all off, the icing on the cake was when Walter's landscapes are revealed to be mass produced paintings that he purchased in bulk for resale - what a con man! This one ended the only way it could have to satisfy this viewer; the whole time Walter regaled the courtroom with his flowery antics, I thought the best way the judge could have handled things was to put it all on the line by saying - 'Paint me a picture'."

" OH Part II on this I forgot! lol
",0.4753,0.9931,2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"A critic , the critic in this film decides what is good or bad on something based on nothing, for art is wholly subjective, its only legs are itself yes against the mirror of the times against the bigger scope that is life, but in general art can only stand on its on foundation that which it created unto itself. The critic says that the paintings are not art because he deems it kitch. But that doesn't take away , from the fact that they are now there, they are manifestations from the creative spirit here to be enjoyed by fans who will like it; the detractors nor its advocates determine whether its art. That's beside the point, giving something a label does not take away or add to what is already there, I can take a can of peas and say these are not peas and slap on a corn label, but its still something in the can, who cares what you call it, there are still people who will enjoy what is inside the can.The point is: Art is for people who can appreciate the final product. To denounce it as kitch or say this is higher art does not take away from the fact that it will make some people out there happy to have this in their life! Those painting are sweet and adorable, that's my opinion, does it change the fact that I like them or someone really really really likes them!? No. Others can hate it but can appreciate another type of art, there is something out there , creatively for everyone, that is what art is, its for the multitudes to soak it all in and decide whether its something that will add to their life or not."

" a beautiful movie by the wrong director
",0.2023,-0.81,2018-11-10 00:00:00,2,Review: I expected a lot more from this movie because I have seen the art and watched the power puff girls and always wondered who would create such a different take on humanity and what was the motive. I found that artwork to be vary fascinating so to have a biographical movie about the artist was exciting but the final product is crap. The direction was very almost heavy handed. I think the studio made a bad decision to cast Tim Burton as the director because this is a very human story on the basis of sexism in America shown throw the eyes of a self made man stealing the credit for his wife's famous art work. Proof this isn't a movie Tim Burton should have been a part of it lacks all his classic trademarks. Its not dark/gloomy and it is not a sort of musical. I think a much better would be either Steven Spielberg or Client Eastwood because they both make movies about human compassion against adversity. The screenplay really holds up to the real person fighting for the credit of her artwork. The casting and acting aren't bad especially by Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. All in all I would give this two out of a possible

" Big Eyes
",0.0,0.9975,2018-07-19 00:00:00,6,"Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) has done a movie based on a true story once before, that was the fantastic Ed Wood, so I was interested to see another one. Basically in 1958, Margaret Ulbrich (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Amy Adams) is supporting her daughter Jane (Delaney Raye) alone in North Beach, San Francisco, after leaving her husband, she gets a job at a factory, painting illustrations onto furniture. At an outdoor art show, while painting portraits, Margaret meets Walter Keane (Golden Globe nominated Christoph Waltz), who is selling his Parisian street scene painting, Walter later proposes to her and they marry. Walter goes to a popular jazz club and convinces the owner, Enrico Banducci (Jon Polito), to let him rent a wall to display the couple's paintings on. A drunk woman is touched by one of Margaret's paintings and buys it, Walter has a fight with Banducci and ends up on the front page of the local newspaper, the club is next packed with curious people. Celebrity gossip columnist Dick Nolan (Danny Huston, also the narrator) wants to know about Walter's art, but is only interested in Margaret's paintings, especially those of subjects with big eyes. Walter shows Margaret all the money they have made from sales, he tells her they make a great team, saying she can stay home painting and he will sell her works. Walter opens his own Keane gallery, promoting the art as his own, selling reproductions, but Margaret is upset he is taking credit for her art, and feels guilty lying to Jane about it. Margaret decides to paint in a different style with elongated features and small eyes, so that she can honestly tell people she is also a painter. Margaret and Walter move into a new mansion together, while going through a crate containing stacks of Parisian street scenes, but she they are signed by another name, she realises Walter paints over the original artist's names and claims them as his own. Margaret confronts Walter about her discovery, he tells her he always wanted to be an artist, but never had the talent. Walter learns of the New York World's Fair and demands Margaret paint something to put on display, when she refuses he threatens to kill her. Older Jane (Madeleine Arthur) discovers her mother working on the large artwork, she tells her mother that she always knew she was the true artist. At a party, Walter is angered after reading the scathing review of the exhibit by John Canaday (Terence Stamp), back at home he drunkenly throws lit matches at Margaret and Jane, they manage to get out after he almost sets the house on fire, they run away. A year later, Margaret and Jane have settled in Honolulu, Hawaii, but Walter tracks her down, he refuses to agree a divorce unless she signs over the rights to every painting and produces 100 more. Margaret agrees and continues sending paintings to California, but then following a visit from two Jehovah's Witnesses, she is convinced that honesty is important, so the next delivery, Walter receives paintings signed ""MDH Keane"". On a Hawaiian radio show, Margaret reveals she is the real artist behind the big eyes paintings attributed to Walter, this makes national news, Nolan writes an article claiming she has ""gone nuts"". Margaret sues both Walter and the newspapers that printed his version of the story for libel and slander, the case is taken to a courthouse in Honolulu, with reporters swarming. The Judge (James Saito) immediately dismisses the libel lawsuit against the newspapers, but Walter is left to defend himself against slander, even cross-examining himself as a ""witness"". As Walter is wasting so much time with his tall tales, the judge decides there is only one way to determine who is the true artist of the big eyes works, both Margaret and Walter are given one hour to paint an artwork. Margaret paints steadily, but Walter is hesitant, claiming that an arm injury has made it hard for him to hold a brush, Margaret completes her painting in 53 minutes and wins the lawsuit, outside she tells the press she doesn't care about the money, she just wants credit for her paintings, she is happy finally signing an autograph for her own work. The end credits claim that Walter continued with his claim that he was the true artist, but never painted again, and died bitter and penniless, while Margaret later retired and opened an Art Gallery. Also starring Breaking Bad's Krysten Ritter as Dee-Ann, Jason Schwartzman as Ruben and the real Margaret Keane as Old Lady at Park. Adams gives a great delicate performance as the manipulated but eventually justified painter, Waltz is wonderfully exuberant as the conman husband, Burton directs this with a real flair, and you can recognise his style with the use of bright colours and a cartoonish look, it is a very interesting fact-based story of plagiarism, fraud and female subjugation, you don't have to necessarily be an art lover to appreciate it, a fascinating and worthwhile biographical drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for the title song by Lana Del Rey. Good!"
" Alright but not exactly gripping
",0.128,0.7775,2018-07-14 00:00:00,6,Not a great film but ending is quite good. I generally like Christoph Waltz but think he's completely miscast here. Otherwise it's an ok film but no more than that.
" Well deserved praise and acclaim
",0.6908,0.9906,2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"This week I watched Big Eyes (2014). Margaret Ulbirch marries a coy, smooth talking salesman named Walter Keane whom she meets at a weekend artist exhibit. Walter immediately sees her talent and within a short time asks her to marry him. Through a series of tangled lies he begins to exploit her artwork as his own gaining national success and recognition, but she plans to take it all back. The film was highly engaging and I was at the edge of my seat watching Margaret's life unfold. I thought about how Margaret was being used, lied to, manipulated, and cheated by a man that she fell in love with. I feel that this was a large aspect of the film that made it so relatable. The writing was a joint effort between Scott Alexander and Larry Karasweski. The film was very well written. The only thing that I wished could have been expanded upon was the daughter Jane's character, relation to the mother, and relevance within the plot. It might crank up the tension to feel torn a little more between Margaret's need to leave Walter for Jane's sake and desire to stay where she is out of fear of the unknown. The film was directed by Tim Burton, so it didn't really suffer from poor direction choices. The most interesting bit about the directing is that it is mostly outside of Tim Burton's style. In fact, if one were to watch the movie not knowing who directed it, Tim Burton would not have been most people's first (or second, or third) guess. The casting was excellent and Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz knocked it out of the park! There were many hands in the editing department, but JC Bond was the primary editor on the film. Some of the image juxtapositions that stood out of this film were moments with nuanced meanings. One such moment was near the beginning of the film was Walter and Margaret's photo is taken and published in a newsletter, which ends up being trodden on the floor of a night club. This was a powerful moment of both symbolism and foreshadowing. Another one of these moments happens right after Margaret lies to Jane about who painted the image on the poster. The next shot Margaret looks up to the cross on the top of a chapel as if she was looking for answers (which she actually does immediately following). The cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel really shines brilliantly in this film. The scenes with light are lit perfectly, and the subject are almost animated in their appearance. Belbonnel also works very well in low light and high contrast settings like when Margaret is in her dimly lit art studio. The light looks both natural and supernatural in its effect. I honestly felt that there was not really much I would have done differently. The movie really deserved all of its praise and acclaim."
" Eye did it
",0.0,0.5106,2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on an incredible true story of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) the creator of the Big Eyes painting phenomenon. For a decade her domineering husband Walter (Christoph Waltz) took credit for the paintings as he also had the gift of gab and can sell them. They market the paintings, posters, post cards etc. Eventually Margaret can no longer live with the lie, as this ends in a comical court room scene.In addition to being a story of the painting, it is one of the male dominated society and over coming the obedience idea in the name of honesty. This is a subdued Amy Adams and not the sexpot we saw in ""American Hustle."" The acting was good, but I felt the film was just short of an Oscar nod.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Let down by mundane direction
",0.0,0.7469,2018-03-04 00:00:00,4,"BIG EYES is yet another example of Tim Burton as a modern-day director: lazy, stuck in the past, and not seeming to make much effort at all when it comes to memorable moments. This film features vanilla direction that'll remind you of a typical TV movie of the 1990s. The real-life story is about a married couple who took the American art world by storm in the 1950s and 1960s by their paintings of children with huge, expression-filled eyes, but their marriage hid a dark secret: for a decade the wife had been doing the painting and the husband taking all the credit. For me, the real interest in the story comes from the media fall-out and the subsequent court case, but this is all crammed into the last half an hour and there's a lot of water-treading before that point. Christoph Waltz is reliably good as a different type of bad guy but Amy Adams fails to convince and is unsympathetic as the lead; she feels like she's self-consciously acting, that's all."
" Interesting, but strange
",-0.09,0.9827,2018-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Margaret leaves her husband and moves to San Francisco with her daughter, where she meets and marries artist Walter Keane. When Margaret's stylised paintings of (mostly) children with enormous eyes start to find a market (unlike Walter's Parisian street scenes), Walter markets them under his own name on the grounds that no-one is interested in paintings by women. Margaret finally leaves the controlling Walter, but ends up fighting him in court to establish the true artistic authorship of the Big Eyes/Waif paintings.Tim Burton directs Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz in this dramatization of a true story. It is a period piece, set mostly in late 50s/early 60s San Francisco, and is rather odd in terms of mood. Waltz plays Keane in a kind of constant manic good humour, in a slightly over the top comedic way. Adams, on the other hand, downplays the put-upon Margaret. The contrast between Keane who, despite the fact that we can always see him as a conman, is likeable and engaging, and his relationship with Margaret, which is essentially abusive, makes the film feel somewhat uneasy. I was very unsure about how I felt about the film at the end.The period feel is captured well and, as one would expect with Burton, it is bright, colourful and eyecatching. I was delighted to recognise the location where I watched a street scene being filmed, even though that scene wasn't in the film."
" Fine but forgettable
",0.1027,0.97,2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"I recently watched Ed Wood which is a biopic Tim Burton did 20 years prior to this. It's almost astounding how different they are. In Big Eyes the characters are charmless, the story is bland and even the overall look of the movie has no discernible qualities.Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz are fine but they certainly don't elevate any of this decidedly mediocre material. Everyone appears to be coasting through this movie. The director, the cinematographer and the supporting cast are doing no more than getting the job done.I think it did a good job of portraying that style of art becoming popular and the overall cheapening of what she was creating. But it never wants to present her as a real artist. It more treats it like a parlour trick.It's difficult to map the exact movie where Tim Burton became mediocre but this one is a great example of why I don't usually don't make a point to watch his films anymore. They don't feel like his movies anymore right down to the stories and the set design.Re-watch Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or even Sleepy Hollow before you consider bothering with this."
" Interesting Biopic, But A Knowledge of The Keanes And/Or Art Would Have Made It Moreso
",0.2144,0.9729,2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"I have to say right off the top that I am no aficionado of art. I say that to make the point that there's nothing about the basic subject of the movie that leaped out at me. It was my wife who watched this and told me that because she had enjoyed it so much I had to watch it. And after checking it out I decided that since it starred Amy Adams (whom I adore!) I would watch it. And I will say that it's an interesting movie - a biopic about Margaret Keane and her efforts to gain credit for her artwork. Mind you, a lot of that was lost on me. I am so unfamiliar with the art world that I had never heard of Margaret Keane or Walter Keane or big-eyed waifs. That was all brand new to me - and, I suppose in that sense, that made the movie worthwhile (although not particularly engrossing) because I did learn something from it.Margaret Keane's life was difficult. She seems to have been a woman who lacked self-confidence. The movie opens with her leaving what must have been a troubled marriage (although nothing much is really said about it) with her young daughter in tow. There's a little bit about her attempts to make it as a single mom (in the 1950's, when that would have been very much out of the ordinary) but for the most part this deals with her relationship with Walter Keane. They meet and fall in love very quickly. Walter had been painting (maybe?) Parisian street scenes while Margaret had concentrated on her big-eyed children. They quickly fell in love and married and Walter began both showing Margaret's work - and claiming credit for it. ""Keane"" artwork became both popular and profitable as it started to be spun off onto posters and postcards, etc. etc., but even as the deception gave Walter and Margaret a very comfortable life, the tension between the two increased. Basically, the movie depicts Margaret's increasing resentment of Walter taking credit for her work, and Walter becoming ever more controlling and even dangerous. The movie culminates in their eventual divorce and a court trial which established her as the artist. I found this interesting as a study of Margaret's life and personality and her growing self-confidence, and it was very satisfying to see her finally revealed as the artist. The background reading I've done since suggests this portrayal (while taking a few liberties) is largely accurate. Amy Adams did a fine job in the role. Christoph Waltz was solid as Walter - sometimes fun-loving, sometimes hostile and frightening, sometimes even violent. Personally, I appreciated the look at the snobbery of the world of art critics, who are largely represented by Terence Stamp's portrayal of New York Times art critic John Canaday - who hated the big eyes. But frankly if people liked the big-eyes then who was Canaday (or any other art critic) to speak so contemptuously about them? The movie was directed by Tim Burton. There's not a lot of his classic, quirky Burton-esque style on display here - although the opening scene, which was a picture of the street Margaret lived on with her first husband, did strike me as the sort of street scene you'd find in perhaps ""Edward Scissorhands.""I found this movie enjoyable and interesting - but because of my lack of interest in the art world I had no strong connection with any of the characters. Had I been interested in art I would probably have rated it much higher than the 6/10 that I gave it."
" Great Biography
",0.6249,0.9956,2017-10-30 00:00:00,8,"Kitsch, a term known in the art industry that describes all art design that is seen as poor taste from excessive crudeness or sentimentality, despite being admired ironically. That is what best describes the paintings of big eyed waifs by Margaret Keane as depicted in the biographical film, Big Eyes, about Margaret's husband, Walter Keane, who took all the credit for her paintings for the public to know. Directed by Tim Burton, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, and starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz as the integral couple, this has to be one of the most underrated films in recent years, and a rather intelligent social commentary about commercialism tackling against sexism in the media and psychological abuse.The first thing to take notice of Big Eyes is how it manages to tackle behind the scenes trauma of all the fame garnished towards the wrong person. The film briefly but understandably gives Margaret a clear explanation as to why she exaggerates the eyes in all her children and why her paintings consist of children in general, due to her daughter Jane being the closest person to her and once having temporary impaired hearing causing her to use her eyes to visualize the world. When she paints her waifs, she is not simply designing pupils for the sake of shock value, more so to express herself from her eyes as gateways to the soul. It's made evident that Walter Keane admires art and originally wanted to showcase his work of landscapes, yet him taking credit for his wife's waifs creates himself as one of the biggest plagiarists in the art media. At first, Walter states to some civilians that he painted the waifs for sale pitches, but as the paintings become more beloved, he soon believes his own lies and rolls with them. Funny how Margaret painted the waifs with average art equipment such as pencils, brushes and acrylic, yet never once is Walter ever seen painting, despite claiming to have studied in Paris. What keeps Margaret from saying who truly painted the waifs is her shyness, her controlling husband, and the sexist belief that art done by women isn't taken with sincerity.Adding on to the leads, the acting is phenomenal with Amy Adams portraying Margaret as subtly strong and optimistic despite feeling knotted by her husband making her weak to succeed. It's their marriage that shows how personal Margaret's work is to her and how devastated she is in Walter's undeserved fame and wanting to reveal the real culprit. Christoph Waltz depicts Walter almost like Jekyll and Hyde, by starting off as a charming and out spoken conman before growing into a deranged and excessive psycho. The popularity has him use Margaret as a painting machine without public consumption while using his time in Europe as the inspiration for the sad waifs, thus contrasting between the flawed success and hidden truth.Other minor characters like Dick Nolan, Ruben, Enrico Banducci and John Canaday either come off as mere obstacles or driving forces for the leads in the commercial fame, critical scorning, and art-house crowd. It's interesting how Walter at one point lashes at Canaday for his negative remarks towards his alleged work in a way of failing to take criticism, when Canaday isn't quite wrong and actually states how art should ""elevate—not pander"". However, the most noteworthy supporting persona is none other than Margaret's daughter, Jane, as the inspiration for the big-eyed paintings. Because of this, Margaret tries to keep her from finding out who really paints the waifs, down to asking a priest for advice after lying to her only child.The screenplay is not only insightful but also quite funny at times as it explores the art scene of the 50s and 60s while seeing typical reactions from the art house snobs, professional critics, and especially the general public alike. One of the most notable efforts in the film is the pretty yet fitting cinematography that emphasizes Margaret's sudden clashing of her imagination against reality. A notable instance of this kind of style is when Margaret enters a boorish supermarket display of her art, and then she visualizes everyone around her with the limpid, haunting eyes of her waifs unbeknownst to the public. It's the way Margaret's nightmares capture the darker side of the real world that makes her trapped soul consume her sheltered life.Lastly, the trial scene is near exact to the real-life Keane trail that took place in the mid 60s to really showcase Walter's absurd lies and desperation for claiming himself as the true artist. This makes Margaret all the more sympathetic and respectful, down to where she managed to befriend Jehovah's witnesses and even gave them her secret. It was after so many years of hiding in the shadows that Margaret could finally spill the beans in a new state (Hawaii) about who those paintings rightfully belonged to, no matter how kitschy. It soon becomes nearly evident that almost if not everyone is on Margaret's side due to her earnest delivery and free will to say the truth about Walter regarding both his plagiarism and notable abusive nature.Usually known for mixing surreal Gothic material and quirky whimsy, Tim Burton accomplishes in crafting a thought provoking, sharp witted, and mildly powerful biopic never afraid of approaching the most outrageous copyright battle in art history. Burton portrayed Margaret Keane as a sheltered albeit hopeful artist wishing the world to see the real creator, not too different from that of Ed Wood. Like that film, she may have been stooped low by those around her, but she always remained positive by making what she loved. Those paintings seemed quite curious but not too distant from their time period, and they manage to still feel relevant today by appealing to anyone fascinated by surreal perspectives of the human mind, like Burton and Keane."
" Portrayal of Keane's joining Jehovah's Witnesses.
",0.0,0.9231,2017-10-22 00:00:00,9,"I haven't seen the movie, since I'm familiar with Keane's story. The BBC had a piece on it ca. 2015. Recently a friend, a fellow Witness of Jehovah, saw it and said the portrayal of our Bible work was quite accurate. This is unusual in popular media.I offer this for any who are interested in an introduction to our 'strange deeds and unusual work'. Isa 28:21, NWTWe should all remember that Hollywood's claim ""based on a true story"" may mean only that the words 'a', 'and', and 'the' are found in both the original and the screenplay. :-)"
" Not Keen on Keane
",-0.2755,-0.9642,2017-09-08 00:00:00,4,"I've said time and again that Tim Burton's dark quirkiness can be quite grating. But never has he made a movie so sorely missing it than Big Eyes. If you've seen any kind of biopic, you've already seen Big Eyes. Anyone could've made this film. If you didn't tell me who directed it, I would've never guessed Tim Burton. A wonderfully twisted world is waiting to be explored from Margaret Keane's haunting paintings, but that world is never discovered. Amy Adams is always a striking cinematic figure, but Burton doesn't allow her to bring that much life or personality into Margaret Keane. Christoph Waltz is Walter Keane and unfortunately this is his least convincing role. Hard to believe and even harder to watch, Waltz chews up the scenery, but brings no nuance to Walter Keane, other than being manic and insecure. He has captured the silver screen as a cold-blooded Nazi and a cunning bounty hunter, but playing an everyday schnook proves to be too oppressive for Waltz. I wasn't moved or engaged. The opportunity for a feminist revenge tale is hinted at early on, but the film gives up on it halfway through."
" Nice Compact True Story
",0.6808,0.8967,2017-08-30 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)This is based on a true story of Margaret Keane, a single mom and painter of figures with big eyes, who meets another painter fellow who hit it off. She isn't good at selling her work but he is a master at mingling and selling. He sort of backs into claiming her paintings as his and she reluctantly allows it as they are making money. He sells and markets the crap out of them, bringing in world-wide notoriety. From that point on, Margaret tries to deal with living the lie. How will that affect her marriage, relationship with her child and her own pride? The story was well-told with interesting scenes and a Burton-esc purposeful color pallet, atmosphere, symbolism and framing of scenes. Waltz and Adams's character portrayals were fun and filled with depth and variety. Very enjoyable."
" Not the worst movie ever, but certainly one of the most easily forgettable
",0.831,-0.9808,2017-06-21 00:00:00,1,"Loosely based on a ""real"" story, the plot is about Margaret, a divorced mother and the painter of kitsch big-eyed children, reproduced on countless every-day items that infested the markets some decades ago. For many years Margaret allowed her second husband, Walter Keane, to claim authorship for her work, while she churned out one canvas after the other and lied to everybody.I am not a Burton's fan and I watched this at home, because it did not seem worth of a cinema outing. I also find those kiddies'paintings very kitsch and did not care much about the author, therefore my expectations were low. Turns out, not low enough.Amy Adams is a good actress, but even she cannot make a sympathetic character out of a woman who - allegedly - lied to her own daughter for years and secretly painted hundreds of canvas of creepy kids to please her hubby. How did she do that? Apparently Margaret's studio was a locked room and her daughter did not found that weird.Christoph Waltz is unfortunately in full sociopath-Hans Landa mood, therefore unbearable. I never liked him much and I positively detested this interpretation. The courtroom scene is hard to bear. It was not Johnny Depp playing weirdo yet again in a Burton movie, but that did not improve the plot.I am not sure what would constitute a spoiler for this, since the plot is so bad and the movie irrelevant. However, I will not disclose the ""surprise ending"", even if you can find out what happened with a simple search."
" The tale of domestic abuse behind one of the biggest art frauds in history.
",-0.8176,0.9761,2017-04-09 00:00:00,7,"A good bio-pic tells more than just the story of an interesting person. It portrays them in the broader context of their era in ways that offer insight into human nature. Among the most recognisable motifs of the 1950's are paintings of mournfully cute children with exaggerated large round eyes. They became known as the 'big-eyed waifs' created by artist Margaret Keane who is still painting at 89 years old. The film Big Eyes (2014) is a true story of the emotional violence and domestic captivity that lay hidden behind one of the biggest art frauds in history. It is also a moving tale of how these immensely popular artworks started as expressions of the artist's pain but came to symbolise her personal triumph.When we first meet Margaret (Amy Adams) she is packing her bags to flee a stifling marriage. She settles in San Francisco and gets a modest job painting pictures on furniture, but her artistic passion is painting children stylised with huge eyes. One day she is swept off her feet by a self- promoting extrovert and painter Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) and they soon marry. His paintings are ignored while her artworks attract attention but the shy Margaret is not good at selling whereas Walter is a natural salesman. On the first occasion, he is mistaken as the artist by an interested buyer and the deception proves profitable. Despite Margaret's misgivings, the ruse becomes the business model with Margaret secretly painting while Walter claims the credit from an increasingly voracious public who were prepared to pay good money for the 'big-eyed waifs'. He becomes a celebrity and they enjoy their new wealth, but Margaret is psychologically burdened by the deception. Walter becomes increasingly paranoid and controlling to the point where she must flee again for her safety. Margaret keeps sending paintings to Walter to get his agreement to a divorce, but soon the burden of the lie becomes too much and she goes public. Walther declares that she is mad and the celebrated case was settled in court when the judge issued an impromptu order requiring both Walter and Margaret to paint a 'big-eyed waif' right there in the courtroom. The truth was immediately obvious.This is an interesting and engaging film on many levels. It is a factual account of a multi-million- dollar art fraud that was committed not by professional criminals but by accident and chance. It was perpetuated because a talented woman was seduced by an unscrupulous conman who turned abuser, keeping his wife under lock and key to safeguard the secret. It is also a poignant story of an artist who painted over-sized mournful eyes through which her painful life was seeking expression. It is a bio-pic with little dramatic embellishment. Amy Adams plays the role of domestic-abuse victim with understatement and almost waif-like wide-eyed naivette. Christoph Waltz perhaps is not ideally cast for this role as his signature persona of predictable evil commences at too high a pitch but must keep rising to maintain dramatic tension. By the time they reach court, he plays an unconvincing ranting psychotic in a performance that is almost comical.Big Eyes does more than tell the story of the Walter and Margaret Keane. The cinematography, period sets and fashion captures the culture and style of the era. It reflects the history of women's role in the pre-feminist era when they were assumed by nature and law to be possessions of their husbands. In recent interviews, Margaret confessed that going public was a ""spur of the moment"" act and she never could have imagined wilfully confronting her husband like she did. Since then, many of her big-eyed waifs have shown almost imperceptible hints of a smile."
" More Intriguing Than I Anticipated
",0.0,0.9492,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I remember learning about this upcoming film from The Nostalgia Critic's scathing review of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. One day, I noticed it was airing on TV and had it recorded to the DVR. Before viewing, I thought it was going to be simply okay - but my expectations were exceeded! It is such a well-made Tim Burton film, especially considering how it's a departure from his usual fantasy stories (albiet some of his own elements are sprinkled here and there, like the hallucination scene). It has a great example on how much it sucked to be a woman in the 1960s (Heck, the very first line in the film say something along these lines) and you really feel for the main character, Margaret Keane - Amy Adams was great as her! I'd never heard of Walter and/or Margaret Keane before this - at least, certainly never seen any of the 'big eyes' paintings - so I found the story to be intriguing and thought-provoking. And I think Lana Del Rey was a good choice for the soundtrack, not just because of the singer's obvious fascination with the era, but displaying the fear and sadness Margaret felt during her life and marriage with Walter."
