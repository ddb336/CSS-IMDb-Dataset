" A DECENT LITTLE HORROR THRILLER WITH THE AWESOME FRANK GRILLO
",0.2058,0.9087,2021-04-01 00:00:00,7,"""DMONIC"" is a pretty decent little small scale Horror-Thriller although the story is pretty basic about a group of youngsters going to an old house to investigate spooky stuff i still, enjoyed it.Here the group are Ghost investigators & go to an old house in Lousiana where murders took place back in the 80's, one guy has visions of the old place & wants answers & things get bloody, it's a possession type Horror from the makers of ""The Conjuring"" & ""Insidious"" so it has that dark creepy demonic atmosphere here & what i did really like is it has some bits that are Found Footage, flash backs & the present aftermath of the slaughter where we meet our main character the tough Detective Mark Lewis, played by the Awesome go-to hard guy of many Genre films FRANK GRILLO!!!! This guy is the reason i got this dvd. Grillo is such a good solid actor & proves it here as he does his Detective work & works alongside another excellent actor, MARIA BELLO who plays a Dr. Elizabeth Klein a Criminal Pysychologist & both give really good solid & serious performances & raise the film up in quality for a pretty low-budget Genre flick.Nothing New here but a well made Detective Murder Mystery mixed up with a Supernatural Horror story & two great veteran lead actors of great quality."
" Typical stuff and black stuff coming out of orifices. Again.
",0.0,-0.4715,2021-02-23 00:00:00,4,"I'm starting to wonder what the connection is between James Wan productions and having a demon/vengeful spirit with black stuff coming out of their mouth or eyes? Insidious, The curse of Llorona, The conjuring all have the black stuff. What's all that about?Flippancy aside the problem with this movie is that it follows the tried and tested formula. There are very few surprises and the jump scare moments fall spectacularly flat.The shaky cam footage that was new and different in 2001 is just irritating in 2015. And that's not the only thing that feels dated. Satanic rituals, weird curses and a creepy isolated house, it's like a list of horror movies cliches were just thrown together by a school kid doing his homework on a bus.I'd like to say this was a popcorn movie but there are better popcorn movies out there."
" Fresh ideas finally
",0.3182,0.8943,2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I liked this. I love horror but good horror with plots and twists. Not sure why the low ratings. But Ive found you really can't ever trust scary movie ratings. This one has jump scares, good character builds, decent story line and some unexpected twist. Very worth your time to watch. Other ones I enjoy are insidious, annabelle, conjuring...those types. This isn't that level, but up there. So if you enjoy those you will like this one. I gave it a 10 to pull the rating up."
" One word review: Meh.
",-0.0772,-0.5004,2021-02-05 00:00:00,3,"If you're looking for a horror movie to watch, you could do a lot worse than 'Demonic.' It's not all bad. But it's also just not worth much consideration.It's impossible to take seriously at first: ""ghost-hunting"" is such absolute nonsense, and the first third of the film is nothing but. There's just enough in the middle third to keep watching and see what's going to happen next. Then the end has some okay ideas, but every possible trope and 'Inception'-style ""BWAAAAHM"" sound cue is crammed into the last ten minutes. What value there may have been in 'Demonic' has the wind taken out of its sails in particular by a finale that's so overbearing, and it ends up falling flat.I try to be very in-depth when pondering and reviewing films I've watched, but I feel like there's just not a whole lot to talk about with this. There are worse movies out there, and I won't judge anyone who thinks 'Demonic' more enjoyable than I do. But my take is that there's just not much to engage with. This is a movie to watch if you want to have something on in the background while keeping busy with something else."
" Pretty good 88 minutes to use up.
",0.7269,-0.5216,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,Ending wasn't the best for me if a sequel has not or will not be made. What was the point of showing ambulance ride if sequel not coming?
" It didn't work
",0.0,0.2655,2021-01-26 00:00:00,2,"The concept of trying to combine a cop drama with a haunted, shall we say *demonic* house, didn't work. The two alternating timelines came off as a way to add filler, and stretch out a story that didn't have enough on it's own. Bonus: the acting and dialogue was SUPER weak. I watched because of Dustin Milligan, and James Wan's name being nebulously associated with the production, but I should've passed this one when I realized it was not what was advertised."
" Solid horror/thriller
",0.1531,0.5884,2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Unsure why so many decent horrors get under average ratings. Can only assume non horror fans are rating these movies. A good horror is hard to come by but this one entertained me from start to finish. Creepy atmosphere, a few good scares, thriller vibe throughout and fairly decent acting and storyline. A good all rounder."
" Don't read the reviews, just grab a snack & watch!
",0.0,0.6677,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Watch this movie for the pure joy of cinematic entertainment! No, its not the best movie but it kept me on the edge of my seat! Jump scares here and there, just enough to keep your heart pumping! I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
" Not Great, but Not Bad
",0.3875,-0.9945,2020-10-16 00:00:00,6,"A group of young adults go into a haunted house to find ghosts/conduct a séance. We've seen it done a dozen times in movies.
This one is slightly different. The action picks up after the expected slauther of those young adults as a police detective interviews the lone survivor.The film is a combination police procedural, shaky-cam recovered footage, haunted house/demonic possession horror. Except it doesn't really give enough in any area to really pull it off.
The shaky-cam footage is sort of worn out by this point to be scary. Plus, the over-reliance on jump-scares may provide a cheap little startle but do little to advance the plot.
I was actually laughing at some of the ways they depict the police investigation. ""Get more freezers for those hard drives!""
And this film really didn't know whether it was a haunted house story or a demonic possession story. Before the séance--when the demon would have been summoned--all sorts of scary stuff was happening. Was the demon doing this? Was it ghosts? Who knows! It's never explained!And while the twist at the end gives you a ""hmm, interesting"" feeling. It is only a matter of a few minutes of thinking that you realize that it's dumb.
Spoilers:
So, the demon, in order to escape his prison must inhabit a ""pure soul"" while also killing everyone who was involved in the ritual to set him free? All right ... so that pretty much means only an unborn child can be the host. Sucks for the demon if they all show up without a pregnant woman, right?
But let's back up. The demon gets John to go around killing everyone ... but for some reason he doesn't kill Bryan, and Bryan runs away, steals a truck, kills or attacks a gas station attendant and then shouts really loudly into the radio to mess with the demon ... so that the police will shoot him? Uh ... okay.And the demon could only be set free once the pure soul travels beyond the seal (kinda like the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones, eh?) So ... the demon then hid Michelle in a hidden crawl space so that the cops would have to spend several hours looking for her? What if they never found her? What if Michelle and her unborn child died in that crawlspace? Sucks for that demon, right?The more you think about this movie, the more you see how easy it is to pick apart.
The whole concept of demonic possession in a haunted house has been done before, and with a far simpler plot. I mean, Night of the Demons was a campy 80's horror (and a rather bad remake in the 2000s), but it at least made sense--it didn't try to be too clever.Anyway, this is on Netflix right now (October 2020), so if you've done the bigger, better films, give this a watch ... don't expect much, though."
" Another tired found footage supernatural horror film
",-0.765,-0.8519,2020-09-21 00:00:00,3,"When five people are discovered dead in an old abandoned house after having performed a seance, police interview a survivor to determine what happened.A rather hackneyed tired found footage supernatural horror film that does little to add anything to the genre asides from a couple of effective moments. Co-produced by James Wan."
" Awful
",-0.4588,-0.4588,2020-09-20 00:00:00,1,I spaced through this whole movie. The twist was awful.
" A paint by numbers horror film that delivers a knocked-off canvas
",-0.5719,-0.9922,2020-06-30 00:00:00,4,"Ghost hunters visit a house to have a séance, where years previously a séance was held that drove a participant insane, resulted in mass murder. What could go wrong? Well, something does go wrong, and it is up to Detective Mark Lewis (Frank Grillo) and his psychologist girlfriend, Dr Elizabeth Klein (Maria Bello), to figure things out. While Detective Lewis concentrates on piecing the evidence together, psychologist Dr Klein tries to get some answers from one of the post-event survivors.I found this movie to be decent without being good, I have certainly seen a lot worse. The cast were primarily young adults who were probably supposed to be annoying, in which case they did their jobs well. I wasn't sold on the detective and the psychologist. I found Grillo's character to be a bit too angry and aggressive - I'm sure some of his techniques weren't on the level with how to deal with victims of crime and potential suspects. Likewise, I found the psychologist to do and say things that strictly she shouldn't be doing in her profession either. They both seemed to be going slightly rogue which in the real world would probably have got them disciplined or dismissed. Certainly not the kind of detective and psychologist that I'd trust in my employment. To recap, the ghost hunting kids were annoying, and the 2 main investigators weren't likable either... so really I didn't care what happened or if anyone survived, which isn't a good way for a film to progress.When it comes to the plot; it kind of felt like I'd seen this already. Flashbacks to an event, while in real-time the interrogation was taking place, and by the end a twist would reveal that everything wasn't how it appeared. The scares in this were predictable and unoriginally dull. There were a lot of jump scares added in, lots of darkness, lots of random reveals as the story unfolded.... But it all felt so forced. The best way I can describe this is by saying the film felt empty. I didn't care for the characters - they were empty, the plot looked like it could have been full of complexity - but it just ended up empty, the horror and thrills could have been good - but ultimately felt empty.This paint-by-numbers film had spaces for all the right fillers - haunted house, ghosts, shaky cameras, lots of darkness, young 'hip' adults, an angry cop.... But like the ghosts that were being hunting, it ended up a soulless canvas. In fact, if this was a paint-by-numbers horror film, it would be one that had been knocked-off (fraudulently copied) - you've seen it done before and to a lot higher standard too.4/10"
" Decent horror, but non existant 3d!!
",-0.4468,-0.8625,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Purchased this to add to my 3d collection but as in most 3d horrors I buy it had virtually NO 3d!! If you watch, and it's worth watching just see or buy the 2d version."
" Very AmityVille like but not as good
",-0.3004,-0.9923,2020-05-20 00:00:00,4,"I had mixed feelings for this film, the trailer was really good and showed it to be a very scary thrilling film, and with the title ""Demonic"" I was had high expectations however that wasn't the caseBasic story is these people go to this house where a mass murder happened with one of them, his mum was one of the people who escaped from that mass murder. They go to this house and start to experience strange things from the start, in the end they all die by a mysterious killer. One boy survives and is being questioned by the detective. Turns out that, that boy who is named John killed everyone then hanged himself and possesses one of the other girls who they find alive, she's pregnant And it ends with something moving in her stomach.So... this film lacked in scariness, there is one scene which did make me jump a little but the film is to short being 1 hour 23 minutes for anything proper scary to happen. The house is possessed by a demon however you don't actually find out how or why. I understand that there was a murder in the house before but that isn't a reason to why it's haunted. For example AmityVille works well because the character hears a voice through the wall to kill his family, whereas this film there's no reason to why it's actually haunted. The acting is definitely questionable and the overall story is very weak. They could have had a lot of fun with this film and James Wan is an excellent producer but this isn't his best. If you want scary then watch ""Insidious"" or ""Sinister"" because this film is NOT good or scary."
" Looked good but....
",0.4404,-0.9607,2020-04-26 00:00:00,2,"Starts off well, but withing 5 minutes the films already starting to show weakness. Like an abandoned house that's still furnished.. The usual and very overused spooky noises and doors slamming bla bla bla, the biggest kick tho is right after the first bit of action.. It skips back to 1 week earlier.. So basically it starts at the end of the film and the rest is just flash backs and getting to know characters you already know the fate of.. Boring. The trailer contains all the scares. The rest is painfully dull and has the feel of a movie made by students."
" Taunt and original seance thriller
",0.4019,0.8589,2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I got so many scares and the tension was so high in the first half of this movie, with the flashback footage handled so skilfully, that I thought ..... this is what the true evolution from Blair Witch should look like. I was increasingly impressed. The jump scares genuinely sent shivers down my spine at frequent intervals. The background soundscape was skilful as well, heightening the tension, and for once the emotional makeup and politics of the players seemed genuine, a tribute to both writers, Director and actors. These are serious young people with intelligence, not fly by nighters. The movie also skilfully avoided graphic depictions of murder and gore, despite so many dying, concentrating instead on the spook. That was something! The movie moves toward a climax that is truly original. Alas that is where it lost the two points from me. It came on very fast and stretched believability, mainly because it involved elements that had had only nominal, maybe three or so small 'manifestations', during the previous build up. I also thought it was a leap too far and unnecessary. But it was original, and I must concede now the filmmakers could move forward to another sequel movie, with a radically different design, yet still inhabiting the same universe, much like, yet not in the same way as, the Conjuring, Insidious or Ouija movies. We'll have to wait and see. Basically this movie is a 10 if you liked the strange ending, and I have to concede we see a lot of similar endings in horror, or a very good 8 if you agree with me. In terms of production and commitment, Demonic ticks all the boxes. Freaky!"
" Isn't found footage/shaky cam dead yet?
",-0.6486,0.4423,2019-12-28 00:00:00,4,We always hope that it is but like zombies from the graveyard it keeps coming back. And why do characters who are supposed to be professional camera operators all suck at it? Anyway who cares? This is a paint by numbers effort.
" Better than I expected
",0.4404,-0.9246,2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"This is not a found footage movie, I hate those things. This is a decent movie telling the story of the police investigation immediately following the typical ""found footage haunted/abandoned place everyone gets killed"" sort of thing. It has enough flashbacks to the kids doing their investigation for you to follow, but the main story is a detective and police psychologist piecing together bits of evidence to find out what happened.There are suspects, missing persons, evidence gathering, like any decent police procedural. But there is also the fact that they are in a haunted house, and they need to figure out what really happened. They do have a bit of first person footage which some may call found footage, but most of the movie is not that.This movie has action, police chase scenes, drama, and enough horror to keep you interested."
" Demonic

From the very beginning it is not clear what happened, I kept thinking, how did almost all the friends of the main character die? And the riddle turned out to be much more difficult, the final for me turned out to be completely unpredictable."

I really liked it and I recomend this movie to everyone who enjoy a good horror. =)
" Classic Demon Tale with a New Twist
",0.0,-0.9905,2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Demonic (Beware may contain spoilers)
This film may have left a few unanswered questions lingering, but it kept your attention and even made us jump out of our seats a few times! An age-old story of a group of ghost-hunters in their 20's thinking they will record the first ever ghost siting by staying at a house with a murderous past. The house was the scene for a séance gone wrong back in the 80s and occult member Martha Livingston murdered everyone involved except for 1 survivor. Why not repeat history?! The movie opens up with Detective Mark Lewis investigating some weird noises at the old house and ends up discovering 3 dead bodies and a survivor, in shock.John, our shock survivor, was part of the group going to spend some time in the house that had not been lived in since the infamous incident, but hesitantly. He's been experiencing visions and feels a connection as his mother was friends with Martha Livingston when she went insane. He's joined by his girlfriend, Michelle, and her group of ghost-obsessed friends.We soon are informed of the pregnancy of John's girlfriend, Michelle. During the séance scene, John sees his mother in the body of Michelle and looking back when the movie it complete that's when the truth hits for viewers. History is truly repeating itself as John's mother was pregnant with John during the infamous murders and she was the late lone survivor. Michelle is the lone survivor in present day, harboring the new demon baby, AKA demon John is the father and intended this situation all along. Dun dun dun.Most likely to study abroad in Europe: Ghost-obsessed Bryan, who you would recognize yelling out ""Fiona!"" from the movie Euro Trip, who is Michelle's ex and a jerk the entire movie. Karma buddy.Most likely to see dead people: Dr. Maria Bello - were you talking to an empty chair the whole time??Best could-be couple - Donnie and Jules ""I want to put a baby in you"" ...too bad buddy.Overall Grade: B"

" Completely forgettable
",0.0,0.5281,2018-10-01 00:00:00,4,"DEMONIC is another possession-focused supernatural horror flick that gets by on jump scares and loud noises. If you like watching young actors overacting a great deal and spewing up black slime then maybe this is the film for you, but I'll admit that I didn't care much for this low budget and predictable outing. It's the kind of film that flirts with the found footage genre without going all the way, and one which wastes talented actors (Frank Grillo, Maria Bello) in supporting roles which merely exist to fill up the screen time. Overall it's nothing special, and completely forgettable to boot."
" Not at all scary
",0.3875,-0.7006,2018-09-30 00:00:00,4,"Just watched this for free on the Horror Channel and I will say that, although it is not a bad movie, it is not worth paying for. Group of kids hold a seance in an abandoned house where mass murder took place some 20 odd years before and needless to say scary, unoriginal things start to happen. Only it's not scary and thankfully it has a modest running time. James Wan's name is attached to it but he didn't direct so don't be fooled."
" My Review Of ""Demonic""
",0.0,-0.9708,2018-08-01 00:00:00,6,"The film's premise is a straightforward concept that incorporates classic, overdone horror tropes with slices of Gen X flavor, in the form of found footage - as in documentary footage recovered from the scene. The dual concepts, although not original, are offered up in a clever parallel time line. It creates a sort of murder mystery aspect, broken up by standard paranormal horror moments next to found footage sequences. To a small degree the mixture sometimes feels disjointed, but the back and forth does break up any monotony that would otherwise be present.The cast give quality performances, the line up consists of recognizable faces, and known names. There is a glare of underdevelopment to the characters, that if a bit of tweaking had been done, could have really became full-bodied portrayals. Still there is enough to make them relatable. Special effects are the typical gimmicks one expects in these kind of films. Shock gags and sound bites meant to give a fright are over used and often fall flat. Still ""Demonic"" has its moments of genuine chills, and the gore elements are quality. Think ""Insidious"" -esque trickery, just a few more misses. The horror moments run the gambit of ""see it coming"" to ""cool and creepy"". Overall the film is a mediocre but watchable horror flick with some quality actors, refreshing concepts, entertaining climax, and enough death to hit that ghoulish spot. It does have some redundancy issues, and a cloud of ""know what's going to happen before it happens"", but the movie gives enough to make it enjoyable."
" Good enough for a Netflix horror movie
",-0.2023,0.989,2018-07-04 00:00:00,6,"I see reviews here from people who saw this in the theater. If I saw it in the theater, and paid actual money for it, I'd probably give it a 5 as well. But I watched it on Netflix while doing my hobby. For that it's perfectly fun. It's not a great horror movie. It relies on pretty predictable jump scares and quick shots of creepy things. You can see the ""twist"" coming from a mile away. But it's not terrible. It's acted well-enough, has decent pacing, and the production quality is good.If you're like me and have watched pretty much every other horror movie on Netflix, then you'll probably enjoy it well enough. If you want a great horror movie, though, then you'll want to keep looking."
" Not too bad
",0.431,0.8829,2018-07-02 00:00:00,6,"After reading some of the previous reviews I didn't know what to expect but I decided to watch this movie with an open mind. I found myself agreeing with most of the reviews that called this film unexpectedly enjoyable. I'll describe it as ""Paranormal Activity"" meets ""Usual Suspects"". Just sit back and give this little gem a looksie and odds are you will not be too disappointed."

" Ghost hunting ends in bloodbath.
",-0.3182,0.9643,2018-04-14 00:00:00,7,"This horror flick will leave as many reasons to like it as dislike it. But DEMONIC is worth checking out for yourself. A group of college age ghost hunters decide to explore an old ""haunted"" house to connect the flashbacks and dreams of a friend with history to the location. Their foray turns into a bloodbath left to be investigated by Detective Mark Lewis (Frank Grillo) and a psychologist Elizabeth Klein (Maria Bello), that happens to be his on-and-off again girl friend. For slasher fans there won't be enough blood. But the movie has a steady pace to sustain interest. Some characters seem a bit uninspired. Will Canon is credited as director and shares writing duty. Rounding out the cast: Cody Horn, Dustin Milligan, Megan Park, Alex Goode and Terence Rosemore."
" Surprising
",0.2732,0.6115,2018-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I expected this movie to be a stereotypical jump scare movie, however I was pleasantly surprised with the character development and the twist at the end. Overall very entertaining"
" Pleasantly Surprised
",0.6124,-0.5344,2018-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Out of sheer boredom I started watching this movie with little expectations and had no idea what to expect. Personally I find the critiques on this movie to be a little harsh. After viewing it I was pleasantly surprised and wanted to watch more movies and even investigated the main character's actor to find out more. The premise of the movie, once you get into it, is simple enough to understand. A murder in a house has taken place several years ago and some ghost hunters want to investigate. The main character, John, has visions of his mother in the house and his girlfriend invites him to join her crew to go to the haunted house to find answers.The movie changes between a police investigate, one that takes place several hours after John and his friends go into the house as well as the events that happened while him and the others were in there. One of those ""a few hours before"" type of movies.I was actually very convinced by Dustin Milligan's (John's) acting in this movie. As someone very familiar with haunted houses, ghost investigates and similar paranormal experiences I thought his acting was believable and scary enough and certainly carried my interest in the film. As far as the movie goes he was the star I can assure you.The rest of the movie I have to say was simply 'okay'. Toss in some weird history, strange symbols, a random bird dying to make it all spooky. Then of course the obligatory ""everyone goes crazy and someone kills everyone else"". The ending of the movie was definitely lackluster, it gives the viewers a plot twist we've seen a million times now and likely already anticipated and, if like me you liked the main character, probably didn't want. As a result the movie was simply 'okay' when compared to others but given the premise of the movie I didn't anticipate to enjoy it as much as I did. It failed at every opportunity to actually scare me BUT I found myself wanting to see more movies with similar main characters and simply for Milligan's performance, compared to all the other actors, I'd say the movie is worth watching. It's certainly not the most fancy, nail biting, gut-wrenching movie I've ever seen but it was worth the watch."
" All over the road...but ends up in its own late
",0.0,0.9314,2017-12-12 00:00:00,6,"I ADORE the opening of this film....and then we are thrown into that awful, extended, whining and sobbing interrogation with the main guy and the cop. O-M-G that annoying sequence could have been cut down by a third and still made sense. I love films that mix the use of traditional cinema and found footage. This one does it ...ermm...kind of well. My only issue was that when it switches to FF it was so ugly looking and sounding. We get it, it is supposed to be video camera footage, but we are still watching a movie and want it to look decent. No one believes FF is real anymore, I wish filmmakers would stop spending so much time trying to make it seem real. Overall, this is a great popcorn flick. I recommend."
" Takes Some Thought, But OMG -- MY ENDING EXPLANATION
",0.0,-0.9945,2017-11-07 00:00:00,8,"So, tonight, I decided to watch this movie thinking it was going to be another ""Insidious"" type movie with jump scares left and right. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is packed with suspense, relationships, scares, and jaw-dropping moments.For the first 30 minutes, I was getting a little bored, but I'm glad I stayed around. It really sets the story up for the last hour. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS** I am now going to submit my explanation for the ending. I am in no way a movie expert, so I can't say my explanation is wrong, nor right. So, if you've watched the movie, it's a no-brainer that the man the doctor was talking with wasn't John. It was the demon taking the form of John. When s**t hits the fan, and the circle is broken, I believe the demon possesses John's body. John then goes on a killing spree, killing everyone except Michelle, Brian, and...get this...Michelle's baby. John (the demon taking over John's body), cuts Brian's tongue out, but Brian is able to escape his grasp. Brian, to save his ex-girlfriend, that he was still in love with, taped her mouth shut, and put her in the secret room. Brian then escapes thru the milk shoot, steals a car to get away. The demon, without knowing where Michelle or Brian is, knows the only person in the house left to kill is John (the body it's taking over). The demon then makes John hang himself, then as the birds fly out of John's mouth, the birds (demon) takes the form as John's body, which the PI found. When the cops find Brian holding up the liquor store, Brian can't speak (his tongue is cut out). All Brian can do is yell. John (the demon in his body), hears Brian yelling, and then acts like Brian is the one doing all the damage, hence John's body being thrown around the room. The demon does this, knowing the officers will open fire, and boom!...that's another person down. The demon still knows Michelle and the baby has to die in order to be free. The demon hears that they found Michelle in the house. The demon then knows they are going to have to roll her over the seal, allowing the demon to possess either Michelle or the baby. When Michelle crosses the seal, and starts going into agonizing pain, that is when the demon is possessing the baby. Michelle then feels the baby kick, thinking it's healthy, until the last scene, when the baby does something weird. I believe the demon knows it must kill the baby and Michelle to be free...and that's where the movie ends."
" Mrs. Livingston, I presume
",0.0,0.8594,2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Skeptical detective Mark Lewis (Frank Grillo) and his girlfriend police psychologist (Maria Bello) investigate the gruesome murders at the Martha Livingston house in Louisiana. They appear to be copy cat murders from an event from 1988. John (Dustin Milligan) who was found still alive in the house is undergoing questioning while two people are still missing.The story as to what happened is told as a subplot as John slowly recalls. A group of paranormal investigators was in the house. It included his girlfriend and her ex-boyfriend, so there is some tension. Some of the flashback segment is hand held, but not the bad kind where all we see are feet and hear people say, ""What was that?"" The script drops all kinds of clues as to what might be going on and they finally come together at the end. I liked the film. It seemed every time things started to slow up a bit, they smartly switched scenes. Yes, it was partially hand held camera and there was a seance, but yet it seemed fresh.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Megan Park announces that she is the film's eye candy, but we don't get to see much of her"
" Enjoyable enough but still somewhat flawed
",0.2382,0.914,2017-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Moving into a legendary house, a group of paranormal investigators attempts to cleanse a legendary haunting while the police investigation looking into their actions try to find out the truth, and once it all comes together they realize the truth about what happened and try to stop it.For the most part, this one wasn't as bad as it could've been. A lot of what makes this one work is the fact that the initial story and setup of the house itself has a lot of stellar history involved. Not only given the newspaper articles that go into detail about what happened, but the opening attack featuring the police investigation of the accident gives this a solid opening that not only gets this going nicely but gives a rather strong foundation to this one which is nicely carried out by the dual story lines running throughout the rest of the film. With the flashback feature allowing this one to run the investigation angle at the end of the happenings while having their encounters shown alongside this, there's a lot of fun to be found. The setup of the troop inside the house where slowly things become quite extraordinary and managing some subtle spooks with the video evidence turning up the moving objects on the walls or broken light sources that fail to work properly moments after working start this off rather nicely, while the concurrent investigation piecing everything together solidifies their activities nicely by being as wrong-headed in their resolutions as they eventually end up being. Since the flashbacks have everything which includes objects bursting into flame, sending people flying across the room or suffering from actual physical trauma gives this a lot of room to play with throughout here as well as the seance sequence which sets into motion the final half which has some rather fun times here. These here make this one a lot of fun although it does have some pretty big flaws to it. The film's biggest problem is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of interesting elements present as this one goes through the rigors of the familiar haunted house tropes frequently, giving this a routine appearance for the most part. There's a rather familiar feeling here that makes the film feel routine here with the way the concurrent investigations are handled which are all apart of the way the police investigation is handled, making for a rather familiar time throughout here since this one force along plenty of familiar elements due to this feature. Likewise, the idea of the multiple finales makes no sense and tends to drag this one on endlessly since there's a lot of rather strong ways this one could've ended yet the fact that there are just all these twists piled on makes no sense as for why they're all included here. These features here bring this one down somewhat.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
" It's almost too CSI to be a horror movie
",-0.5719,-0.8867,2017-09-27 00:00:00,5,"The movie spends a ton of time with the police, processing the crime scene. It really kills the horror when the haunted house is full of cops. Without spoiling it, the twist seemed to be added last minute and doesn't work with the rest of the film. To me, it appeared the writer wanted a twist ending, but didn't know how to do it right, and it just comes off as a jumbled mess."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,0.9632,2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"After a terrific opening involving a charismatic cop Detective Mark Lewis (Frank Grillo) investigating a houseful of apparent corpses, we flit back in time to find out how the tragedy occurred. Here, my heart momentarily sank, as it seemed we were to be treated to the dreaded 'group of friends' prevalent in films like this: fast-talking picturesque teens all bitter and moody because of some banal relationship disaster (one of the number, Michelle (Cody Horn) is secretly pregnant). But luckily, 'Demonic' only flirts with such soap-operatics to establish the characters before flitting back and forth to an interview with the only survivor, John (Dustin Milligan). Such back and forth shenanigans ensure you have to pay attention, which is of course, No Bad Thing. John, the poor sap, is being interviewed by psychologist, Dr. Elizabeth Klein (Maria Bello), who informs him he may go to jail as a result of the carnage and no other suspects.I enjoyed this for many reasons. It's dark and gritty, like a supernatural version of something like CSI and other punchy police dramas the US do so well. It is also set in Louisiana, a locale that brings happy memories of 'The Mummy's Curse (1944)' – it may be by the Kharis association, but the raw, humid, swampy location seems to work well with this kind of horror. Also, the acting is universally good, with the young cast soon shaking off the shackles of initial worries concerning precocious, bland stereotypes. The production as a whole is polished and foreboding, faced-paced and atmospheric. Will Canon does an excellent directing job; all scenes are packed with visual interest that highlights every cobweb and speck of dust in the ramshackle house.As the title suggests, demonic rituals appear to have been carried out at the remote house the five friends investigate. Unwisely, a séance is carried out which appears to unleash all kinds of spirits, none of them you would want to share an elevator with. Familiar jump-scare-tactics – upturned crucifixes, slamming doors, hideous faces in mirrors, use is even made of found-footage filming to confound what we think we know – all of these are used restrainedly and against a backdrop of convincing grit and gloom. There's even a twist ending.'Demonic' doesn't set the world on fire, but is a fine, solidly produced way of spending 83 minutes."
" Demonic Suspects
",-0.34,-0.4019,2017-07-16 00:00:00,6,"A group of ghost hunters visit a house where a séance happened that resulted in a few deaths. The paranormal investigators decide to do another séance which turns out to be a bad idea.This one opens up with the police arriving on the scene of what appears to be a bloodbath. One survivor is found and the police begin to question him. The story is told through flashbacks leading up to present time.Fast paced, keeps you hooked and loaded with jump scares. Bonus points for not being a full blown found footage flick. I would sum this one up as a Unusual Suspects meets Ouija. Worth the watch.6 birds flying out of your mouth out of 10."
" All but one die.....
",0.0,-0.951,2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Ignore the convoluted plot and the history of the narrative, and you have just another haunted house movie where silly young kids who think they are the next big thing get killed off one by one by someone who may be possessed.But add the acting chops of Grillo and Bello, and it takes the film from the mundane into something that is a little bit better than it has the right to be.So to cut a mundane story short, someone believes that a certain house is calling them, so a rag tag team is assembled and plan to do a seance to awake the spirits in the house.There is an element of found footage meeting Rashomon, but that's where the similarities to that film end. We go back and forth to the footage that was filmed, and the interrogation between one of the characters and Bello's Psychologist.And that's it really, we have the obligatory jump scares, people walking around dark corridors looking scared, and an ending that tries to emulate The Usual Suspects.Grillo and Bello are fine making the most of a poor script, but you couldn't care less about the selfish kids who try to summon the spirits.It could have been something quite entertaining, as the story does have potential, but it's executed poorly."
