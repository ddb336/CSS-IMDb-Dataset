" A gangster movie based on true story
",0.4215,0.8724,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"As other comment wrote that it is a great angle to tell about gansters. But I would also give credit to the fact that it is based on a true story. Usually biographies are often based on famous people. But because the true story is based on a couple who are not-famous people, so it may not fit in well in biography category. A gangster movie base on a true story tells the crueltiness of gangster while robing anyone else would just end-up in jails."
" Too cute for it's own good ......
",0.7096,-0.6282,2020-12-05 00:00:00,3,"Cute idea gone bad, would best describe this tepid mob movie. The initial concept of a couple of deluded lovers taking on the New York mob, by armed robbery, is at first intriguing. However, the presentation is so uneven and annoying that things quickly wear thin. There are far too many flashbacks driving home a point the the mob killed a florist. I mean after the first one, a Chimpanzee would get the point, and any time a flashback happens beyond the initial one, it simply serves to be annoying. For a mob movie the robberies are pulled off way too easy, and makes gangsters look like helpless total fools. The film is almost bloodless, totally predictable, and ultimately forgettable. MERK"
" Not too bad!
",0.484,0.827,2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"My only complaint was Andy Garcia. Too genteel and elegant to really be a mob boss. He looks more like a college professor or orchestra conductor.. mob guys don't have facial hair unless they are in hiding.
Michael Pitt is incredible but another actor from jersey boys and boardwalk casino i think played the part better."
" I Give Nina's legs, the Music and the Story
",0.0,0.9678,2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Perfect tens and everything and everybody else a 9. This is about as close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a while. I'm surprised it didn't get a wider release and more publicity when it was made. My only question is ""Prime, do you have any other gems like this hidden in your inventory?"" I loved the piano score and was hypnotized by the perfection of Nina's gams. Thank you Prime."
" Bonnine and Clod!
",0.0,0.4751,2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,Engrossing telling of a true story. You'll marvel at how short-sighted and yet how successful - in the short term - they guy was. Of course the moll follows her love blindly. Could have been formulaic but it wasn't. Good performances by the leads
" Very entertaining film based on a true story.
",0.7178,0.9715,2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,Probably like most of you I found this film by accident.There is no doubt in my mind that Nina Arianda stole this film.Obviously she is a very talented actress and is awesome on Goliath on Prime. The story is compelling and very funny at times. It's always nice to see the NYC wiseguy actors all over the film. Plus of course the great Griffin Dunne and a surprising Ray Romano as a sympathetic reporter to the couple.
" Worth a Viewing
",0.2263,0.9239,2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,It's been done before for sure but Michael Pitt and Nina Arianda are going to be very big stars. The supporting cast is fantastic and this flick will entertain you.
" A MOUSE NEVER ATTACKS A LION
",0.3412,0.6369,2019-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Tommy's (Michael Pitt) father was a victim of the mob. His girlfriend Rosie (Nina Arianda) helps him gain vengeance as he robs them and sometimes taking their pants for added embarrassment. Based on a true story set in the early 1990's our likeable couple gathered information from the Gotti trial and used it to exploit the mob.Billed as the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" of NYC, Nina Arianda played a delightful Bonnie as Pitt provided a moody Clyde. It is an interesting crime film, low on the action scale.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Nina Arianda in pantyhose."
" Aww. love this movie
",0.6369,0.9022,2019-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Nice spin on the mob. Great images, acting and story love."
" Rosie may have been dumbest person ever born.
",-0.5106,-0.5574,2019-05-16 00:00:00,4,"Tommy (with 2 ""m""s, says Rosie) is nto much swifter. The reporter is only slightly sharper than Tommy. And the wiseguys are what they are because they figured out early on they weren't going to be rocket scientists.All in all, the film is depressing in making you realize how many morons are out there."
" ""You want to take down the king, you got to sacrifice a couple of pawns.""
",0.0772,0.8965,2019-04-30 00:00:00,7,"What would you call it - chutzpah? Arrogance? Lack of foresight? Plain stupidity? To think that these two young punks could get away with robbing the Mafia in their own social club environment was nothing less than a death wish. Which is the only way this could have ended, so you pretty much know where this is going right from the start. But the fun I guess, is in seeing how genuinely crazed and motivated Tommy Uva (Michael Pitt) gets when he barges into one of the mob dens and strips them of their valuables, not to mention their clothes during one particular escapade. Unintended consequences abound in the story, as with 'The List' and the wiretap team taking notes and setting up the trap that would take down twenty members of the Mafia following the arrest, trial and incarceration of John Gotti, Boss of All Bosses. I had my eye on the front pages of the New York Daily News and The New York Post during the Mob's heyday, and plenty of those featured the latest hit, but I don't recall anything about this pair of youthful hotshots trying to score on their gangster elders. For their effort, they got whacked on Christmas Eve, 1992 and never saw it coming. They should have used those Mexico tickets."
" Amazing story.
",0.5859,0.624,2019-04-26 00:00:00,8,I guess the most amazing stories are really found in real life.
" A Crooked gem
",0.0,-0.8579,2019-04-22 00:00:00,7,"In 2014, ROB THE MOB, based on a true story, was released. It had a difficult history and went through many changes before being filmed, but, in the end, the makers of it got it right. A young couple, Tommy (Michael Pitt) and Rosa (Nina Arianda), are trying to overcome addictions and prison terms to make a life for themselves in New York City. While they both get jobs as telephone dunners, Tommy dreams of striking it rich and hits on the idea of robbing mob 'social clubs' on the theory that criminals are unlikely to call the cops. Of course, it's not really that great of an idea for reasons that are obvious to sane people, but Tommy is bent on revenge for the mob's killing of his father who was in hock to the mob. With that said, it's a funny thriller made all the better by fine performances from Ray Romano as a crime reporter, Andy Garcia as a mafia-family head and Griffin Dunne as the best boss in the world."
" Just another poorly made 'New York mob movie'
",0.0,-0.8658,2019-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Just another ""Oh, I'm from New York so I'm... somehow... 'associated' with the New York mafia, so I'm a 'tough guy'. Pathetically laughable.
Hollyweird REALLY needs to stop fixating on New York and L.A. scumbags and lowlifes."
" ""Rob the Mob"": Funny until it Isn't
",-0.1779,0.9545,2018-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Any movie that can make mishandling an Uzi with a touchy trigger seem almost cute can't be all bad, right? And the based-on-a-true story gangster drama ""Rob the Mob"" is certainly not a bad flick. The likes of Andy Garcia, Michael Pitt, Burt Young and Ray Romano pretty much guard against that. I found myself laughing, wincing and damn near shedding a tear while watching this oddball odyssey about a young couple who get rich from, and revenge against, those who have it coming. And all the while giving little thought to the reality that there may well be hell to pay for sticking it up the wazoos of some chillingly bad wise guys. The media didn't christen these crazy kids ""Bonnie & Clyde"" for nuttin', pal."
" Stupid nonsense
",-0.7269,-0.9494,2017-04-28 00:00:00,3,"Current rating 6.3.Final rating should be 3.6 What person says to another who is wearing a mask and holding a loaded weapon: ""If I ever find you, I'm going to kill you"".What possibly could the guy with the gun do. Let's think about this... he could run away and let the guy who threatened to kill him find him and kill him or, oh yes, he could simply shoot him dead right there and then. That is what he should have done. But, oh no, he doesn't otherwise the story - and the film would probably end right there.So he runs away to his car. The fact that the stupid hero couldn't then get into his own car and his girlfriend took off in reverse gear just adds to the complete stupidity of this film.Don't waste your time on it. Garbage."
