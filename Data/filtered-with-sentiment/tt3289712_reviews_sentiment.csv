" Anoher incomprehensible score
",0.0,0.9547,2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"I'm induced to write this review as a way to counteract the overall low score of this film, one it surely doesn't merit.I'll start by declaring I've always enjoyed the performances of Katherine Heigl. They are always believable and genuine regardless of the genre and in ""Jenny's Wedding"" she doesn't disappoint. Her co-stars are also very good, notable among them Linda Emond as her mother Rose and Grace Gummer as her sister Anne.Several reviewers complained the part of her partner Kitty, played by Alexis Bledel, wasn't well developed and although correct I felt the movie was more about the dynamics of a somewhat conservative albeit loving family under stress by the impending wedding of their daughter and sister. This is where the film shines with excellent performances and witty dialog to examine the growth of its members as they come to terms with this event.The bottom line is that the low score must be due to reviewers who don't like Heigl for some reason, an impression bolstered by comments of that sort. It's completely undeserved."
" LGBTQ+ Story : A Touching, Moving story how families can change.
",0.0,0.8074,2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie to watch on a lazy afternoon. Jenny who is 30ish woman. She has never brought a guy home. Everyone tells her that she should get married as her biological clock is ticking. While talking to her father she confessed that she is in relationship. She realises that she should get married and start a family. Later she comes out and tells her parents that she is a lesbian. On her mother's request she hides it from her sister only to hurt her later. Jenny's brother happily accepts her and tells her that he knew this since high school. Jenny's sister reconciles and also ends her troublesome relationship with her husband. In the end Jenny's parents also agree to be a part of the wedding. The movie shows the difficulty of life of LGBTQ+ group. The behaviour of society, lack of acceptance of family members, and a lot of issues of LGBTQ community. I loved the movie and would recommend it to everyone."
" This is what happens when you make your LGBT films in the microwave...
",0.0,0.9951,2020-09-21 00:00:00,2,"There's just no short cuts when it comes to telling a heart-wrenching LGBT tale. You have to do it right and this is... Not wrong, necessarily, there's just no flavor.It's like someone who typically writes Lifetime movies tried writing an gay movie for the first time. They painted by the numbers and they stayed inside the lines perfectly... Which is fine, but boring.Everything is so cliché and predictable. If this movie had come out 25-30 years ago and had better acting, it could have been great.The most interesting character in the whole movie is the heterosexual sister but she's also so dislikable that it doesn't even matter.Alexis Bledel was not the first choice for the love interest character. The previous actress dropped out at the last minute, so they had to replace her. Not that it matters, as she has little screen time or personality. She is the Kristen Stewart of this movie.There is also no chemistry between the lead and her love interest. They've apparently been together for 5 years but they have the chemistry of two wet paper bags who happen to be flopping around from the wind in the same grocery store parking lot. They share one kiss and it's awkward and hard to watch, like two teenage girls who've decided to practice kissing for the first time during a slumber party.The movie is so cliché and on the nose that when Katherine Heigl's character tries to walk away at one point and the song ""She Keeps Me Warm"" started playing I literally laughed out loud. That was the only time I laughed or felt anything resembling human emotion during this movie.I found this for $5 used somewhere recently and bought it just because it's so laughably bad it might be fun to rewatch with friends for a Bad Movie Night."
" Nice movie of a basic human day to day problem
",0.0258,0.6297,2020-09-11 00:00:00,8,"There are a lot of ways to rate a movie. As this movie is not a fantasie but on a real day to day social problem i really liked the storyline, the topic of a lesbian couple in a small local community As well as the struggle of a family. This is a movie about real life and the way it's been acted deserves a good rating."
" Watchable
",0.0,-0.1539,2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"I'm confused as to why Jenny's Wedding has such a bad rating! I literally created an IMDb account to write a review lol. This is far from my favorite movie but I do believe it's watchable. It's low key, not really a romance but more of an emotionally turbulent coming out story. I thought it was good enough to watch twice because I recommended it to my roommate."
" Don't Bother
",0.2584,0.8364,2020-07-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. In saying so, I won't waste too much time by expanding, but I will say this - the editing made fairly good actors seems below average, and every other aspect of the film is like drinking watered down milk. Just don't bother."
" What the hell
",-0.6808,-0.4337,2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Honestly what the hell is this crap! I watched about 15 minutes and had to turn it off, this movie was released in 2015 and it seems like it was made in the 80s or something honestly it's pathetic! Not just the story but the acting and the camera work is disgusting aswell! Definitely don't bother!"
" A great hate watch
",0.1027,0.6567,2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,This movie is so terrible that I love it. The story is complete garbage and the portrayal of the lesbian couple is completely unrealistic. During the movie the couple in question only kisses three times and when they do it's horribly painful to watch their lack of chemistry. I definitely recommend this to any lesbian who wants a good laugh because this movie is ridiculous.
" A Bashed Gem
",0.0,0.6858,2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,A great ensemble cast. A bit old fashioned in the way Jenny came out. I could see Jenny bringing her friend over to her parents house on a holiday years before she finally made the big reveal. A bit clumsy when it comes to dialogue with the parents. It just feels like this story wasn't really necessary in real life. But having older parents like Jenny has can become complicated and frustrating at times. So perhaps it's all not completely unnecessary.
" Lies only hurt
",-0.7351,-0.4767,2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,I think one of the most important messages of this coming out movie is it shows that lies are harder and more hurtful than the truth.
" Wonderful Movie!!
",0.6467,0.7835,2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,Made me laugh and cry! This movie is very relevant today. It makes you think about what is truly important in ones life. A definite must see!
" Realistic movie about coming out
",0.0,0.9039,2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I have to say I don't understand the negative reviews. The movie stayed true to the human nature to reject something different. My mother came out when I was a grown adult and even though I was a full supporter of the LGBTQ community I did not fully support or understand it. This film accurately depicts the struggle of feeling lied to and confused! It was not just about Jenny's story about coming out but a family that had no idea she was gay to begin with. It may feel predictable but it's accurate. Confusion and denial are normal human reactions but with a family that stays true to love, acceptance and support always follows! I also felt like the parents acting was spot on as well."
" The single best movie of all time
",0.6369,0.9354,2020-01-29 00:00:00,5,"This is the best movie ever made in history!!!!!!! It is completely unique and utterlyok sorry I can't keep it up. I'm just mocking all of the people who upvoted all of the positive comments even if they had no substance, and down voted all negative reviews, even really insightful ones.This movie had the feel of a 20-years-too-late Lifetime style movie and none of the characters had much depth so it was hard to really care about them. I'm very glad I didn't pay to see thisAnyway I hope you thoroughly enjoyed this review. Send"
" I can totally relate to her.
",0.0,0.9729,2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"The movie was really great. I mean the story was so good that it somehow reflects what I felt as a closeted lesbian. And it really is scary let other people know especially your family. I really hope that people who are straight or parents who have lesbian children would watch this. This movie is so true.For those people who are looking for romance this is not your movie. This is for those lesbian out there, their family and for the rest of the world to know how it feels to be a closeted LESBIAN or at least be different from the norm. For them to know that being different doesn't make us bad. That at the end of the day we are still human who is longing for acceptance, belongingness and love."
" Jenny and Kitty
",0.0,0.881,2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,"The movie should have been better, but could have been a lot worse. The acting saved it from the weak script. Heigl, Bledel, and Wilkinson provided the needed spark, as did the other actors. The ending was unrealistic however. So many in Jenny and Kitty's situation haven't experienced this happy ending, unfortunately. If anyone's mind was changed as a result of seeing this film, in a positive way, then the movie was worth it."
" Not bad but lacks some authenticity
",0.2323,0.9752,2019-11-18 00:00:00,6,"It's good to see gay representation in films and the difficult issue of ""coming out"" makes a perfect Hollywood film. However I feel it's quite unrealistic. Jenny has known for a long time she's gay. She's had time to get used to it. She springs it on her (old fashioned conservative) parents and expects them to be ok right away? I haven't been close to this issue but surely you'd let the family come round to your relationship status in a little time- you wouldn't threaten to cut them out of your life within days of telling them? Would you? Surely you'd give them some time and consideration? I also think it's silly that she lied to her brother and sister- younger generations are more open to gay relationships. It was an ok film- about as good as any other Katherine Heigl's films- and it's good to see gay marriage getting some showcasing but it just didn't feel realistic"
" Honest Portrayal of Family Behavior
",0.5106,0.9876,2019-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Yes, I agree with other reviewers this isn't an earth shattering movie, but what it does do is show a realistic view of what both a gay person and their family go through when trying to deal with a child that comes out. I went through very much the same thing for years until I finally told my parents ""it was either you love me for who I am or I walk out the door and never appear in their lives again.""
That was probably the hardest moment in both their and my lives but it defined who we were as a family. Luckily my parents came around at least a portion of the way, especially my Dad.This is definitely a must watch for anyone who struggles with a friend, child or relative that has come out. Today it's not such a big deal and many more people accept it but what they may not know is that it's still a very hard admission and reality for the gay child. Accept. Love. And, embrace."
" Some really great acting
",0.659,0.8962,2019-08-02 00:00:00,10,"I won't give away any spoilers, but if you want a great story line of how family member interact with each other, so that no secrets are untold, then you should watch this one.... some really great acting!"
" Clearly written by straight people
",0.5574,-0.9348,2019-07-24 00:00:00,2,"Unfortunately this really lets LGBT movies down. From the nonsensical writing and screenplay to the poor production quality, and worst of all there is no chemistry or intimacy between the supposed 'couple' at the centre of the plot. I was really disappointed."
" Badly written, poorly executed
",-0.4767,0.5482,2019-07-15 00:00:00,2,"This movie is very clearly a straight person's vision of what it's like for a gay person to come out to their parents as an adult. Or at least it plays out that way on screen. The acting does not underscore the type of emotion a viewer should feel, and the message is delivered poorly. Neither Kathryn Hiegel nor Alexis Bledel convince the audience they have been gay all their lives let alone for even 5 minutes. I was really disappointed in this movie."
" They have zero chemistry
",0.0,0.8656,2019-04-16 00:00:00,5,"Okay so i get everyone is trashing this movie, and then everyone else is getting annoyed at the people who are trashing it. But honestly, weather you like this movie or not it is without out a doubt that the couple have litterally no chemistry between them whatsoever. it may aswell have been a movie about two friends getting married. The movie itself, however, whilst it isnt awful, it isnt great either."
" Not convincing
",-0.3089,-0.6224,2019-02-28 00:00:00,1,"To be honest it's the worst movie I've ever seen. So predictable,so clichè, no smart dialogue. The choice of character wasn't good either, I can't believe that the movie was about a lesbian couple, it doesn't seem like that for me. I gave it 1star because I couldn't give less"
" Amazing movie
",0.5859,0.8788,2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so good and made me bawl. I'm not even gay but this movie was inspirational. I literally cried, Katherine Heigl played that part so well."
" Absolutely Terrible
",-0.5256,-0.1451,2018-06-23 00:00:00,1,"Watched it. Hated it. Had to reset my password from years of inactivity just to write this
Premise to the film was solid. Katherine Heigl is hit and miss with me, and this movie was a big miss. Alexis Bledel always great and was no exception in this film. I was fully aware I was watching a movie the entire time I stayed awake. I found that Katherine and Alexis were mismatched for these roles. I wouldn't waste your time in watching this film."
" So glad I watched the movie before reading these reviews!
",0.5551,0.9519,2018-05-28 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie and especially its content. To many, this is a sensitive topic. For some of my friends, it's reality. Some may not be able to see this as a good movie because of the reality. Heigel and the entire cast ""fits"" this movie and Im so happy to have it in my list of fave life changing monies!"
" How can a coming out movie go so wrong!
",-0.6466,0.6232,2018-05-15 00:00:00,2,"This is the coming out movie told by a bunch of straight people. Every cliché is fulfilled. It's bland, not funny and just boring. Wow!"
" So underwhelming
",0.0,-0.4005,2018-04-24 00:00:00,2,"So boring, poorly wirtten and a waste of time. I wish I could could get that time back"
" Meh...
",0.0,0.9759,2018-02-09 00:00:00,5,"The movie starts off OK. We've got Katherine Heigl as a lesbian comming out of the closet, with conservative parents, gossiping sister and a brother. And showing the hipocrisy of the parents and the conflict is pretty interesting.
But then an hour passes and it gets so horrificly boring.
Of course the movie needs a cliche happy end so everyone has to make up. But it just becomes lazy and basically shows the montage of the offended father with preparations for the wedding.
The brother has no purpose in a movie. The sister and her husband are just awkward. They only serve the purpose of showing that straight relationships can be toxic, but it is done in a such lazy way... 
The father's character is inconsistant. First you think he's going to support his daughter no mather what. Then he turns his back on her cause she made one scene.
The mother is the most interesting and best acted character. You can understand the conflict between ""what will people say"" and ""that is my daughter"". Once they get along the movie could end for all that I care.
The main character's love interest has no personality or backstory whatsoever. We only find out that she's a teacher and her mother lives far away. We don't find out anything about whether her parents even come to the wedding. It's Jenny's Wedding, not Kitty's. Kitty is just an accessory.
And finally - Jenny. I don't personally hate Katherine Heigl, nor do I adore her. Here she is just a generic character that you basically don't care about enough to like the movie."
" Um, I think someone is putting folks up to write positive reviews here...
",0.5574,-0.7193,2017-12-28 00:00:00,2,"Jenny's Wedding is an utter, tone-deaf disappointment. Tragically behind the times and generally flimsy. The theme may have been more appropriate 15-20 years ago. But now? It's beyond tired. ""Mom, they were kissing! In public! Can you believe it?"" You must be kidding.It's SO CLEAR that this movie was not made by any queer women, and none of it is believable. The supposed lesbians have zero chemistry...they have long talon fingernails for crying out loud! I wouldn't even recommend this movie to parents struggling with their daughter's sexuality because the characters are all so unlikable and pitiful. IF you are a queer person hoping this movie will offer a decent representation, don't waste your time."
" Straight person makes gay art (badly)
",0.2263,0.7902,2017-10-10 00:00:00,1,"Jenny's wedding is a straight person's attempt at making a gay hallmark movie. Sad, filled with stereotypes, and Alexis Bledel. I found this movie on my quest to find a lesbian-centric film that wasn't overly sexual (looking at you, Blue is the Warmest Color) and had a happy ending where both girls were alive. (The wedding was a bonus) Unfortunately, I was let down. This movie is not good, even by hallmark movie standards. Katherine Heigl must have mixed up plaster and her foundation because her acting left so much to be desired, I actually felt bad for Alexis Bledel's character, Kitty, for falling in love with an OBVIOUSLY straight statue. One thing that this movie did get right? Straight People and their antics. Kitty is called Jenny's roommate up until literally, the day of the wedding."
" needs to be better
",0.4404,0.9818,2017-09-12 00:00:00,4,"Jenny Farrell (Katherine Heigl) is gay but has kept it a secret from her conservative family. They keep trying to set her up. She decides to come clean and marry her five year girlfriend Kitty (Alexis Bledel) who the family assumes to be only her roommate. Her sister Anne (Grace Gummer) assumes that she's dating a married man. When she comes out to her parents (Tom Wilkinson, Linda Emond), they push her back into the closet.There is a bright, Lifetime, movie-of-the-week feel to the proceedings. It's interesting to see this seasoned cast. I want it to work but it lacks deftness and skills. This should be darker or funnier or more indie. It needs to be more compelling. It would be cutting edge if it came out twenty years ago. It's tiring how old this all feels. This cast should be amazing especially Wilkinson but they are restrained by the script. There are snippets that are almost interesting. It's a struggle considering how much better this needs to be."
" A very down to earth movie!!!
",0.0,-0.9744,2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"Even telling what this movie is all about is a spoiler. Jenny is our girl next door belonging to an ""ordinary"" family who grew up in a closely knit neighborhood. Jenny does get married but not as per her parents expectations. She is gay, a fact that she kept away from her family all along until her as well as her family's attempts at getting her set up on dates with random guys pushes all of them to frustration. So at her father's behest she finally decides to tell her family who she was dating. This is a coming out story of a woman who was openly lesbian in the city but all sly when it came to her family and locality. It's about how the parents reacted when their favourite child threw something at them that they just didn't understand. When Jenny tells her to her mom who she was particularly close to she wasn't so much afraid of her being gay as she was of what ""people will think"". Its clear from the fact that she asks Jenny not to tell this to anyone except her father right now. She is worried of her life in that community where she has lived all along.Jenny's father's reaction is equally baffled although he rests his gun on the mother's shoulders and would rather talk about how her mother was getting hurt rather than his own confusion and resentment. They are baffled that they never understood this about their child. This is a textbook reaction of parents that they are ""ordinary"" people and they don't get it. The movie was very down to earth about handling this subject from the POV of a regular family. Tom wilkinson and Lind Emond as the parents were extremely believable. It was amusing to see how the father couldn't look on as the brides kissed after cutting the wedding cake although he had come around to accept his daughter's sexuality. Katherine Heigl's performance as Jenny was good. Her partner performed by Alexis Bledel didn't have much to do except look on supportingly. It was taken for granted that her parents had no objection and all was well at that front. This movie is not an out and out war cry for the LGBT community. It is not corny Or prudish nor is it overtly sexual. It is targeted at those people who dealing with the uncommon sexual inclination that they do not understand. They they never have come across in their known circles.These are regular people who do not deal with the ultra liberal ideas that come with cosmopolitan life. I see a lot of critics panning this movie. Someone blamed it of dealing with ""too much sheltered people"". But that is the fact. Not everybody lives sex and the city kind of life. Majority of people live an ordinary low key life and yes a ""sheltered existence"". Someone has to make a movie about that kind of people too. A movie's degree of impact varies based on the context and complexity of the situation addressed in it and not every movie will address the most complex even though talking about the same issue. Not every gay person evolves to be a LGBT revolutionary and not all families are utterly rejecting although they have their sets of challenges. This movie is a low key drama which is very identifiable and extremely approachable."
" How to become gay in a strictly conservative family
",0.0,0.9833,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"If this movie intend to be funny, it should just take my suggested title above. It have comedy genre in IMDb but I don't see any humorous scene going around, the only funny thing that I can find here is her sister's grass. So, this movie shows about how woman like Jenny need to sacrifice for her sexual orientation choice, she have pretty conservative family, the harmless ordinary parent and she just had enough with her secretive life. She need to tell them and then all hell break loose. I don't like the way this movie try to teach audience who maybe got the same problem to become rude with your parent just because of their love. In this movie, Jenny have been with her partner, Kitty for 5 years but she have been with her parent her whole life so why need for her to be so rude, she knows them so well, why cant she just take it easy and let them take it slow. Even though I believe its always happen nowadays, you cannot acting rude to your parent who have nurture you, love you and care so much about you since you was a child just for your 5 years love life. I don't accept her scripted move at all.Another thing that I think was really unfair in this movie is all other heterosexual life is depicted as problematic, unhappy and everything about Jenny's life is good and happy even though her 5 years partner Kitty never really do anything to help her rather than just standing around doing nothing, her role is so selfish and this movie is too ""playsafe"" and quite unfair in their way to justify Jenny's action.So, I just can say this movie is so lack of depth and we've seen it a lot in LGBT movie and I give it 2.5/5 because its just okay for one time viewing of your life. Please, don't copy Jenny's action, at all cost. Love your parent, you will surely be 100% happy. Guaranteed."
" NOT 20 years to late...
",0.0,0.9842,2017-08-04 00:00:00,7,"...because there are people every day facing exactly the same challenges as the people in this film. Is this cutting edge on a national level? No. But it is very cutting edge for real everyday people and will be for years to come.I'm not saying this is the greatest film ever made, but I found it interesting, sometimes a bit thought provoking, and while it didn't have a slam dunk mentality on the subject of gay/lesbian marriage, it highlighted what real gay/lesbian and their families go through.Katherine Heigl is very good as the lesbian around whom all the fuss is occurring. This is hardly a stand-out role for her, but she's good here.A little difficult to get a sense of Alexis Bledel's acting skills. The focus -- and the other bride to be -- is not on her.Tom Wilkinson is believable as Heigl's old firefighter father, although this is not his best role, by far.On the other hand, Linda Emond, as the mother out acts everyone else on the cast. I wasn't at all familiar with her, but she excellent here.Grace Gummer as the sister. Sorry, but no. I hope to not see her in another film.Yes, they all seem to live happily ever after. And maybe that's not the typical outcome of situations like this, but these actors made it all seem believable and real. You're not going to be knocked off your chair with this film, but it will give you some reasons to think."

I just wanted more scenes with the couple.The writing was pretty good. Give it a chance, if you are looking for a Lesbian drama. It's a pretty low key movie, but not half bad.I enjoyed it for what it was."

Who we are and who our family wants to see are relevant even outside the gay not gay issue of the day. watching the family deal with the love versus the personal issues (what will my friends think, and don't even try to pretend that we don't all worry) See it enjoy it, live for this movie does celebrate life, Oh yes Kathryn Heigel is in it and I thought she was wonderful. so there."
" Out with old ways
",0.0,0.5187,2017-02-15 00:00:00,3,"Katherine Heigl tries to stretch her acting muscles playing Jenny a lawyer who is openly gay, living with her female partner (Kitty) for some years but has pretended to be straight to her conservative family and passed her partner off as a roommate. At various functions people ask Jenny about boyfriends and she coyly answers about never meeting the right man.When Jenny announces she plans to marry Kitty, her parents and sister freak out along with many people in the neighbourhood. Jenny feels isolated and even disowned by her parents.The film has noble instincts but it is vacuous and dull. There is little hint of a genuine, loving relationship of any kind between Jenny and Kitty. The character of Jenny's sister is irritating going on about how it is always about Jenny seeking attention although there is a subplot where the sister faces the shortcomings in her own heterosexual marriage.Thew film's sentiments just feel dated and many of the character are just insufferable."
