" Almost physically painful
",-0.3862,-0.987,2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,"I don't think I'll be able to convey how absolutely horrible this movie was. The writing was some of the worst I've seen in a very long time.The premise is fine-a group of four men take women to the woods and hunt them for fun. The ""twist"" is that the woman they're hunting now is a trained assassin that's going to kill them because some dude adopted her when she was like ten and trained her to avenge his family (who the men killed).So... why did she have to go into the woods with them to kill them? Why couldn't she have just picked them off one by one? Why couldn't the man just kill them himself? Why did he need to train a ten year old girl for years to do it for him? How did he know they were the killers, and why did he not go to the police?He also tells her not to take a gun, because guns aren't reliable and can run out of bullets. So, it's clearly better to go into the woods with four men and no weapon at all? Better to not have a gun at all than to MAYBE run out of bullets??? How does that make sense?Near the end, the 4th guy is hung by a noose around his neck. Where did she get the noose? How did she hang it up to a giant tree? What was the point of having her wrists tied in the beginning if she got out of them in two seconds and they weren't a hindrance to her at all? She should have had to kill the first guy while her hands were tied and then used his axe to cut herself free. And she mentioned one of the men's worst fear being his girlfriend cheating on him with his friend, which he saw when he hallucinated. How did she know what he hallucinated? Did he announce the whole thing as like external/ internal monologue? So beyond stupid.This movie COULD have been good. Maybe if we didn't know she was an assassin until the end. That way, we would be rooting for her as a ""victim"" and there would be more tension and suspense. There would be more intrigue, with the audience wondering how she knew the previous victims and why she was so good at fighting. I wasn't tense at all during the movie because 1. I didn't care about her. And 2. She's a TRAINED assassin who is obviously going to kill them all. Where's the suspense in that?Anything intriguing about this movie is introduced in the first ten minutes. That reveal should've come at the end and then maybe it wouldn't have felt like such a complete waste of time...Not to mention, the acting was (in my opinion) wooden, awkward, and almost physically hard to watch. Completely miscast with Abigail and the dude that trained her."
" Good entertainment...
",0.4404,0.9735,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"I like these films with a somewhat demilinguished construction, they look like cutouts, which gradually fit into a light atmosphere of suspense and mystery, aimed at the adolescent audience, with a touch of cynicism, ironic and fun, strong female character, very stimulating and attractive... Abigail always beautiful, delicate and avenging here, sexy and enigmatic Wes Bentley, good entertainment..."
" So people spend money to produce THIS?
",0.0,-0.7841,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"If it weren't for the eye candy Wes Bentley, I would have rated it -10. So a 30ish guy kinda adopts a little girl in order to train her to fight against some teenage boys ( who were also little children then ) who ll kill teenage girls in the future.I can't even..."
" Doesn't live up to potetial but still good fun
",0.8519,0.9653,2021-03-20 00:00:00,5,"Given there are quite a few better films along the same lines this was always gonna be an up Hill struggle. Other comments point out glaring plot errors so not much need to regurgitate them. However a few comments I can't agree with are the ones questioning Abigail Breslin mot being a suitable choice for Veronica. Personally I found her appealing and ideally suited as the innocent girl next door type that turns the tables. Ok she's no Scarlet Johanse, she can actually fight, but I still found AB an acceptable stand in. Guessing having Scarlet as Veronica would have meant the $2.50 budget left wouldn't have gone too far.
I do have to say tho, and this really is the ultimate goal of any film, and that is I really enjoyed it. Glaring plot holes, ropey script but I still liked it, it's fun, entertaining and dare I say it enjoyable. If I'd paid to see it my view would've been different but for sat night on the TV. Hey I've seen a lot worse"
" Terrible movie. Don't waste your time.
",-0.1945,-0.9118,2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,At least 20 girls are murdered by four guys in tuxedos. They pick up the girls in the same diner and they're always blonde. No cops in this town I guess? You never get any reasons why they do it nor do you understand why Veronica's trainer knows about the boys but has never alerted the authorities. Terrible storyline and a terrible movie.
" SIMPLE YET AFFECTIVE
",0.0,0.4504,2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's very simple... boy meets girl, boy tries to kill girl, girl kicks ass!!! Watching this pretty little girl tear these boy a new one was very entertaining!!!"
" Not a good movie
",-0.3412,-0.8573,2021-02-09 00:00:00,2,"I had high hopes for this film, but when the young lady who had been trained to be an assassin for 10 years could not throw a proper punch I realized that I was going to be disappointed and I was. The script left so much unanswered, and was just odd. This definitely had potential, unfortunately it was unrealized. Unless you just have 2 hours to waste, keep looking."
" Not good movie
",-0.3412,-0.7906,2021-01-22 00:00:00,1,This is a horrible movie with horrible director I don't know how to describe it when you know already know who is from who isn't when it was supposed to be mysterious
" Yup, its really bad!
",-0.623,-0.9273,2021-01-21 00:00:00,4,"I confess I doubted this could be this bad, considering the cast. But I was wrong. Its really bad. Such a waste of talented actors."
" bad
",-0.5423,-0.7906,2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Everything seems to be one big show
The lighting interferes with the authenticity of the film
Everything looks staged and presented as a crime reconstruction by the police.
Bad"
" Enjoyable Movie
",0.4404,0.5177,2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,The start and backstory isn't great. She should have been training years? What were they doing for the first 12?Either way I really enjoyed the rest of the film. The bad guys are are interesting but easily disliked. Our hero lead female beats their arses to a pulp!! Watched this a couple of times now and surprised by the poor reviews.
" Problematic
",-0.4404,-0.5267,2020-12-31 00:00:00,5,This movie is nice but is problematic. Estocolmo's s√≠ndrome is serious
" It could have been better
",0.4404,0.3767,2020-12-28 00:00:00,5,"Technically is fine. The lead actress is fine. It's not boring at all but the movie is let down by the plot. Unbelievable things like the group of boys had killed a minimum of 12, later it transpire it was more than 20 but how could this be even possible in a town? I mean they'd be on the news and the FBI would be all over the place if more than 20 young women had gone mising.
Another thing, why would she not use a gun and instead had to dispatch them with her bare hands. Incomprehensible. Why is her teacher after those boys, how would he know about it and the cops not?
Who is that guy who trained her and why?"
" Final Girl is just dull
",-0.4019,-0.34,2020-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Abigail Breslin does have appeal unfortunately this film for mine lacks any .
Decidedly lacklustre"
" I have kinda split 50-50 feelings about this one...
",0.0,-0.6046,2020-11-20 00:00:00,5,"Firstly, there is a lot of good things going for this film: love the colors and light and dark tones play, acting is fine,music is ok,fantasy storyline is ok too.
Now bad things...I feel that director tried to imitate a lot style of several famous directors(Lynch,Tarantino,Rodrigues ),but at the same time tried to hide their influence,by implementing his own technics,which would be admirable,if it wouldn't muddy style of the film altogether.Another thing,I find that the main actress was a terrible choice ...When she tries to be the deadly female killer or whatever,she just looks ridiculous and stupid...Could,at least,someone show her how to clench fists for a fight???)))Absolutely horrible.But I watched it to the end and wasn't too bored)It means to me,that it is a tolerable one time watch)"
" Just awful!
",-0.5093,-0.4171,2020-11-10 00:00:00,4,"This is a really bad movie. The idea had some potential but it needed a lot more work. The cast is good but the acting is terrible! Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the actors. It's like they knew it's going to be bad so they didn't even bother. Also, I like Abigail Breslin but she is not a good choice for an assassin. She is too soft an gentle for this role. Also, her acting here is very awkward. Wes is also a good actor but his character here is almost unnecessary. The story could have been much more impressive if the girl had no training what so ever. Just a strong will to survive. The four killers couldn't be more ridiculous. Any decent cop would have caught them a century ago. Why would a trained assassin have any trouble overpowering them? A trained assassin wouldn't even need to drug them. And since she knew what she was going to do why not come prepared? What's with the stupid game? Why even bother? Nothing about it made sense. These four idiots killed 20 girls? Why would any girl even go in the car with four strangers? The story needed some serious development or as I mentioned earlier let her be a regular girl with a strong will to live that uses everything around her as tool to survive.
Sorry but it's like it's a silly teen movie. It's not horror and it's definitely not suspenseful. The fighting scenes are lame and the dialogue is stupid. Seriously, who made this piece of crap and who spend money on it?
The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the cast is good (although not here), it's watchable (if you have absolutely nothing else to do) and because I've seen worse. Thumbs down!"
" Turn off your critical thinking and enjoy.
",0.2263,-0.7294,2020-10-18 00:00:00,4,1. Why would he train a girl to be a good killer - i.e. as good as he already is - for 12 years? He could have killed those boys 12 years ago and have SPARED many girls lives! He had more than 12 years to think out a GOOD and EASY plan to kill them.2. They know where they guys are. They watch them. Why not just shoot them there and then? Why risk another girls life..?But as said - ignore these BIG and awful plotholes - and watch it for what it is; a 'kick-ass-girl-kill-bad-boys'. Turn off your brain for a while and appreciate it for what it is.
" Forgot it was supposed to be horror, but really awesome either way
",0.6946,0.755,2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"So I chose that movie because I'm binge-watching horror movies on netflix.
Turns out this movie feels very little like horror, more like the usual Action Thriller type.Nonetheless, this movie was really exciting to watch, never a dull moment.
Cool actors, interesting plot idea.Would definitely want a tv show based on this."
" Abigail is a hottie
",0.0,0.7262,2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,When I saw that Abigail breslin was the star in this movie I knew that it was gonna get my libido running lol. She has grown a lot since zombieland (2009) the first movie that I saw her in and she looks really good as a blonde.4 guys for some unknown reason dress in tuxedos and target young blonde girls to force them to run through the woods while they hunt them down and murder them. It's an interesting build up to show how Veronica (Abigail) is trained in combat. She ends up drugging them all before the hunt with a drug her trainer says makes people face their greatest fears.It's not until the last 30 mins that they make veronica start running queue the hallucinations as she fights back against them one by one. Not much of a horror movie in my opinion. I give it a 6/10.
" Awesome, not too scary, still auspenseful!
",0.7918,0.983,2020-09-14 00:00:00,9,"Abigail Breslin has grown from a pretty girl to a gorgeous grown young woman! She reminds me of Dakota Fanning in her ability to hold a stare with those piercing blue eyes! She seemed to pull this off with grace and ease. I would trust her in any role at this point. Very up and coming. This could have been a series with her and the good looking co star together. I would tune in for it. Also, I liked the female empowerment aspect of it.
I look forward to seeing more movies like this.
My last words when she finished one of her deeds were, ""Little Miss Freaking Sunshine, to you""! Go girl! Make more good movies!"
" Extremely disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.4767,2020-08-25 00:00:00,2,"Poor script, lame action sequences. Was hoping for much more from Abigail Breslin."
" You modern-day people are dumb! Under 5 reviews? Why?
",-0.6062,0.9296,2020-08-23 00:00:00,6,"I don't like slasher guts-fly-around type of movies! That is why I loved this horror. It is not filled with guts and blood.This is movie about twisted guys who murder beautiful girls. As a psychology enthusiast, I can congratulate director for portraying dysfunctional mother son relationships with few bits during the movie, providing some answer on ""why someone does something like that"".This movie you gonna watch both with ""wtf"" and ""hm, interesting"". Actually, If you don't let bad reviews get ya', you're going to look at this movie as an interesting horror gem more than just a low budged movie. The vibe is dark, but still not ""slasher"", the girl is lovely and most of all... bad guys get a lesson, one they will take with them to their grave!I liked it."
" Surprisingly Brilliant
",0.7184,-0.6738,2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I don't often rate movies of 8 & above but this gets a solid 8. The only reason i didn't give this a 10 was because there could've been more to the revenge fighting tactics, and the drug plot wasn't needed despite her own skills - no spoiler here, you'll know what i mean upon watching.
I was undecided whether to watch based on the negative side of reviews but i put my trust in the must watch positive reviews. My initial interest was the storyline and the revenge in the woods theme.
The acting is superb especially from that nut case foursome.
It's a gem, there's nothing quite like it."
" Such a disaster
",-0.6249,-0.8086,2020-08-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just so lame lol , characters main skill should be fighting ang all that , but girls preformance is so poor . Fighting scenes is just cringe worthy"
" No chance
",-0.0516,-0.5994,2020-08-08 00:00:00,4,"I'd love to say that this movie is a waste of potential... but the truth is, there's no possible direction this story can be written with any substance. The training scenes deceive the viewer with hope of a good storyNothing happens. No surprises, no real drama... Just violence and tedium"
" The plot is just soooo poor
",-0.4767,-0.7267,2020-08-07 00:00:00,1,"It is a really bad movie. The argument does not make any sense, with so many plot holes, that there is just no plot. The story diss not make any sense, except for putting a wimpy girl to kill four adolescent assassins. Acting was good, though, but watching the movie is a total wastes of time"
" What were you expecting?
",0.0,0.8718,2020-08-06 00:00:00,1,"It amazes people can choose to watch what is obviously a B grade movie with a B grade title starring B grade actors performing a B grade plot and then are mystified when the movie is no good.

" Abigail Breslin is about as miss cast as you can be for this movie.
",-0.1531,-0.0772,2020-07-28 00:00:00,1,Abigail Breslin is a tiny very soft doughy young women who is as unbelievable as an assassin as one can get without using cunning and weapons. Since she has neither she is as unbelievable as you can get as an assassin.
" Very stylish!
",0.0,0.9465,2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"So under-rated! This movie oozes with style and originality. The acting is very good and the movie doesn't follow the norm for this genre. You have to forget the standard sequence of events that this kind of tale usually follows and just indulge in it. I can liken it in many ways to Luc Besson's Nikita which is probably the best movie of this kind. But Like I already stated, this is very original.
Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
" Poor acting
",-0.4767,-0.359,2020-07-26 00:00:00,3,This plot was intriguing but very poorly executed. The acting is very disappointing and there was way too much exposition. It's surprising that Breslin went from great acting in miss sunshine to this awkward forced plight. She seemed uncomfortable the entire movie and like she was always grasping for her lines. It gets 3 stars for potential and good plot... it's just completely undeveloped and poorly acted and makes one want to scream in frustration.

" Not believable. (Contains spoilers)
",0.0,0.1882,2020-06-22 00:00:00,3,Abigail Bresslyn just isn't believable as a killer. I didn't believe a single one of her fights. Now all the men are a different story. I found them all totally on point.

",0.0,0.8242,2020-06-21 00:00:00,2,"The inspiration from the characters in ""NIKITA"" (French movie by Luc Besson) is so obvious it is plagiarism.
However, DON'T expect anything from the original... The writing is terrible, the acting is atrocious, the dialogs stupid, ... well ... don't bother watching this, even if you like the genre. Life is too short. And I've already spent too much time writing this review. I just hope it will save some people from watching this."
" Clever (not)
",0.4588,0.8556,2020-06-21 00:00:00,4,"Being aware of movie tropes and cliches is one thing. Trying to take them apart and create something clever is quite the task on the other hand. One that might sound easy on paper and fun as an overall idea, but is really difficult to actually realize.Having said that, without the actors at hand, this probably would have ended even worse. While the obvious and quite predictable ""story"" unfolds, we tag along for the ride. Now maybe if you have not seen many horror movies or movies in general, you may be smitten more by certain things ... even then though I think you would get annoyed by the movie sooner rather than later. Blood and gore and violence overall - well you wouldn't be able to do the movie without them. The ending is almost so rewarding though (in a sense), that it almost saves the movie"

Let me count the ways: Weak plot, supernaturally bad dialog, ""horrible"" doesn't do the acting justice, terrible continuity, and of course, that all comes from abysmal production and directing. It's everything we've come to expect from this genre. The best thing about this film? The torture only lasts 84 minutes!"

" Twist on an old formula generally fails to work
",-0.4215,0.8144,2020-04-08 00:00:00,3,"When I came across this movie on Netflix, its premise of being a twist of the old and tired ""Most Dangerous Game"" made me curious enough to give it a look. But sadly, like so many movies Netflix picks up from independent filmmakers, the movie doesn't work very well for the majority of the time. It's well lit and photographed, which does on occasion make for some striking imagery, and the Vancouver area backdrop does generate some atmosphere. But the movie is still a chore to walk through. It takes over half of the running time for the ""hunt"" to start, with the movie padded up to that point with showing background of the heroine that certainly didn't have to be so long. And when the hunt does start, most of the action isn't all that exciting or compelling (though the final bout does have a little heat.) It also doesn't help that both parts of the movie generate a number of obvious questions that are never answered to our satisfaction, sometimes without any kind of explanation. If you want to see a rendition of this formula done well, search for ""Surviving the Game"" or ""Raw Courage"" instead."
" Unexpected turns and plays on tropes
",0.25,0.7345,2020-03-11 00:00:00,8,"I like things that subvert my expectations of horror and this did it in spades. However it was taken in such a different direction that I can see why people seem to dislike it. Honestly, it's less horror and more of a musical/noir than anything, it just doesn't break out into song...which I'm super glad about. If you are looking for a trad slasher movie than skip this. If you want to see something entirely different from the genre then enjoy!"
" Bad on every level
",-0.5423,-0.9087,2020-02-08 00:00:00,4,"This movie is so bad, it doesn't even seem to have a real beginning, middle and ending. The female lead is apparently a trained fighter, solely for the purpose to hunt down a group of guys who hunt girls for no other reason that they accept their animal side.Besides the fact that this movie just starts somewhere halfway with no build up, the acting is atrocious. What doesn't help is the (deliberate) overacting and improvising.Al that could be forgiven if the movie was slightly scary or at least had some thriller elements, but none are there except for in the last few minutes. But even that could be forgiven if the action was decent. But no, the fight scenes were even sloppier than the improvised dialogue, axe swinging and yelling.Avoid at all cost, unless you want to hate a movie, or just stare at Abigail Breslin for a while."

",0.4404,-0.5267,2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"So, this is how it was all over Netflix back in the day.
Student-projects with unknowns in weak stories and a fancy cover.I am glad Netflix finally got their act together.Because this film is a low-budget, one dimensional story which makes no sense at all.Very boring and choke-full of plot-holes.If you got 1.5 hours to spend, spend it on something else."
" Great concept... Underdeveloped plot.
",0.6249,0.9674,2019-12-31 00:00:00,5,"This movie came on great and Midway it was great, I love the concept of the boss / Master teaching a little girl / young lady how to become a trained assassin. What's missing though is the backstory! And the development of how the characters came to be who they are 12 years later. I would love a sequel maybe, and they can take us back and bring us forward, that would awesome."

The action is good as the acting and there is interesting chemistry between Abigail Breslin and Wes Bentley but again that raises more questions.
If you can get past the glaring questions that are left unanswered the film is entertaining enough it's just the loose ends that are a little frustrating."
" An excellent twist on standard horror fare
",0.0,-0.4601,2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,It's hard to find a horror film where any female lead doesnt spend most of the run time running away and screaming while being pursued by predictable killers.This film decided to do something different. Ok the villains are still fairly predictable and we get left with a lot of questions about our leading lady's background and motivation...but it's still an excellently fun film.The turning of tables to the standard horror tropes is highly enjoyable and I actually brought this film after a watching.
" Poor casting
",-0.4767,-0.1162,2019-12-21 00:00:00,5,Overall ok movie with decent concept. But Abigail Breslin ? She's not remotely believable as the well trained vengeful assassin lol. Her moves are weak and sloppy and don't instill confidence. Unlike Saoirse in Hanna.

",-0.3818,-0.0682,2019-11-21 00:00:00,1,"I expected from the film that it would be at least more or less entertaining. But this is just frank hack, mediocre and meaningless, shot as if only to wash a certain amount of money."
" Abigail Breslin a assassin?
",0.0,0.6133,2019-10-23 00:00:00,3,"The plot is a great idea and overall great acting for this B flick. The major flaw is the miscasting of Abigail Breslin as a assassin, she seems extremely unsure of herself and the physical/fighting acting is horrible, the actress has never thrown a punch nor has had any training for combative scenes (evident in every single scene she is to do such) . Overall a solid 3 star."

However, their latest target Veronica (a spot-on sharp portrayal by Abigail Breslin) proves to be more than a match for these dudes.Director Tyler Shields keeps the compact and compelling story moving along at a constant pace, maintains a cold grim tone throughout, generates a good deal of tension, and stages the kill scenes with snazzy panache. Adam Prince's tight and smart script puts a neat feminist spin on the survivalist horror sub-genre by having a small and fetching, yet lethal and resourceful lady dishing out harsh justice to some highly deserving hateful misogynistic male scum. The actors who play said male scum excel in their roles: Alexander Ludwig as cocky ringleader Jameson, Logan Huffman as the maniacal Danny, Cameron Bright as the suave Shane, and Reece Thompson as wormy mama's boy Nelson. Wes Bentley also contributes a sturdy performance as Veronica's stoic mentor William. Gregory Middleton's glossy widescreen cinematography provides an impressive polished and stylish look. Well worth a watch."

When the antics in the woods started, right around panda-time, I lost interest.

" Interesting plot

But I think, that another actress would be better fitting for the protagonist Veronica, maybe Isabelle Fuhrman or whoever. Abigail Breslin is one reason to don't give more stars here, she was not so authentic in my eyes. I'm in general not one big fan of her acting. The villains are good putted for the plot, they're giving one good atmosphere of that they want to hunt woman's as one crazy game (Hunger Games style), this is one interesting story. But the movie has his weaknesses too, for example the back flashes are sometimes confusing. But it's really amusing to see a lot of bad critics, like it's the worst movie in all the history and omg give me my losed time back!!! That's so exaggerated. It's completely understandable when someone don't like this movie, opinions are always different. But there are so much more bad movies than this one. It's really ridiculous to say that this film is the worst that exist. So if someone search one movie on Netflix to watch alone or with one date or whatsoever, it's one good choose. The plot plays more with the feeling of hunting helpless girls in one forest than to be one brutal slasher. All in all I recommend, I was liking to watch and will probably watch again."

Did it hold my attention through out? This movie did, wasn't too many slow parts. I didn't look to see how much longer I had to go to the end.I know my next question makes little sense. Did the movie make sense? What I mean by that is does it answer all my questions about what's going on. Friday the 13th psycho undead killer/slasher make sense? Yes.. they explained it pretty well. Final girl.... not so much. So this dude recruits a little girl to kill these teens. Okay why her? Shes smart. That's all I got. Why didn't he just go do it himself, he obviously knew about them, why else would he recruit her. Next, why does he want her to kill them and what the hell do they have to do with his wife, again I got nothing. This plot is like swiss cheese. Okay my next question for movies. Visually appealing? Meaning plenty of blood, gore, and such. Also how was the movie filmed. Really hate cam movies. I was pretty happy with Final Girl, some good blood and some really good cinematography. Last question I ask is how well did it make me laugh. Sounds weird but some movies are so bad I never laughed so hard. Leprechaun for instance, hilarious movie. I had a few good laughs here.
I gave it 5 stars based on the swiss cheese of a story, very unbelievable. Could have been so much better, but still watchable."

" A genre bending film.
",0.0,-0.7834,2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,"My spoiler free review for The Bloody Asylum that can be found at WordPress, Mr Geeky blog:This gem of a film initially came to my attention because of Abigail Breslin being the lead. Anyone who knows me will know that one of my favourite films is the unjustly underrated Maggie from 2015, in which she co-starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger.Abigail Breslin despite being only in her 20s has been acting for nearly 20 years. Her first feature film role was in M. Night Shaymalan's Signs way back in 2002. She then went on to appear in the highly acclaimed Little Miss Sunshine, Oscar nominated for her scene stealing performance. However, she is more widely known by horror fans for Zombieland and the series Scream Queens.The final girl, as horror fans will know, refers to the last female survivor of most slasher films. The title Final Girl intentionally wrong foots the audience, being a film that is quite a bit different from that which its title suggests, feeling unique and very unpredictable. It combines elements of the slasher genre, along with La Femme Nikkita, and The Most Dangerous Game in the World. The film-makers take the expected genre tropes of these films, yet gives them an unexpected spin. Although it does use some slasher conventions there is very little blood and gore. The story itself is told in a linear form, whereas the feeling is a non-linear narrative would have added more of a mystery to the events as they unfolded.While it does have some faults, Final Girl is a really solid debut feature film from photographer Tyler Shields that overcomes these faults. The really impressive aspect is look of the film, so obviously from the eye of a photographer. However, while at times stunning to look at the film would have benefited from a more grittier feel.The real strength of the film lies with the cast. Abigail Breslin, Wes Bentley of The Hunger Games and American Beauty, and Alexander Ludwig, more widely known for the TV series The Vikings and The Hunger Games, being the standouts. However, a little more depth to the characters would have made the film as a whole as engaging as the performances.The Final Girl is a hugely enjoyable film with some depth to its themes. At times it feels like it is spoofing the genres of film it references, but made by fans of those genres. At 80 minutes long it rattles along and is never boring.For those looking for something that is a little different and unpredictable you could do far worse."

I dont know if director had something different in his mind rather than hack and slash movie, but apparently he was not able to tell it. There are so many ""why"" questions in the movie,but there is no answer for anyone of them. Summary of the movie can really attract you, you can expect a plot twist, some psychopats committing murders until they encounter with an assasian girl. This could be a good plot but they used this idea very poorly.In short, it is a waste of time, and if you decide to watch it you will be sorry for the time you spend on it."

The draw for me is and has always been Abigail Breslin (she's a real cutie pie/kid), especially at this stage (about 18 y.o.) of her life. Still a little chubby, young girl smiley and cute, thick with small breasts like the many young girls in real life, happy and adorable. Sadly for me, not her, as life progresses, she gets more grown up, with a thinner face and thinner body, larger breasts and is changing into the beautiful young woman that we always knew that she would become.
Even though I enjoy the fantasy/nonsense of this ill cast (5' 1"" thick little pretty girl)/revenge killer, I always enjoy the overview of this fun Ima-gonna-kill-em-all movie carried out by a beautiful young girl/child. Loved her then, doubt that will change as she grows into the actress that we all expect and into the mature beauty that she is to become. For me this movie is an up and coming Abigail Breslin classic. Sad to see kids grow up. Bon Appetit"

There was too much light in the darkened forest which was too unrealistic. As for the hallucination horror scenes, they weren't on par with such classics as The Blair Witch Project (1999), The Cell (2000), Silent Hill (2006), Black Death (2010).

In this case - I must implore anyone and everyone to give this film a try. Even if your ultimate experience is indeed disappointing, it won't be half as bad as to justify the low rating and terrible reviews here.Final Girl is simply a fun, satisfying revenge flick telling the story of some sort of operative in a secret above-the-law agency given the task of eliminating five stereotypical psychopaths who enjoy toying with girls before killing them. I would have personally liked to see more of their evil deeds so as to enjoy their punishment all the more. Cheap, maybe, but utterly satisfying nonetheless.
True, this revenge concept has been done before, and a lot better (see: I Spit On Your Grave) but not every film has to be a groundbreaking act of genius in order to be fun and rewarding. I personally enjoyed every second, every bit and every death of the villains. Add to that excellent characters, on-the-spot acting and great overall atmosphere and you get a wonderful experience of bad guys suffering beautifully painful consequences.Final Girl if far from being perfect or even impressive.

",0.1531,-0.853,2018-01-26 00:00:00,6,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Tyler Shields, ""Final Girl"" concerns a little orphaned girl in Washington (state) who is trained by a mysterious cold man, William (Wes Bentley), in assassination techniques and the use of drugs. Veronica's first real mission is to target four pompous young guys, who are sociopathic murderers. Abigail Breslin plays the protagonist.This is a cool meshing of films like ""Hanna"" (2011), ""The Hunger Games"" (2012) and ""Point of No Return"" (1993). The British Columbia cinematography is gorgeous and the tone is surreal, but there's not enough character exposition, which is the movie's main flaw. Other than that, this is top-notch filmmaking. Viewers complain that Breslin was wrong for the role because she wasn't ""cut enough"" and the emphasis was on how cute/attractive she appeared than on being a convincing slayer. But Veronica (Abigail) was cultivated by William (Bentley) to be an assassin, not appear on TV as a martial arts celebrity. Assassins are SUPPOSED to be inconspicuous, not openly pegged as merciless killers. That's why William had her dressed in pretty dresses, etc. She wasn't supposed to look like a kick axx assassin. It's the same reason Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) was picked by high command for his mission in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). To help understand the movie, reflect on the spotlights in the forest. They weren't just there to give an artsy feel; ""Final Girl"" is darker and cleverer than that. Veronica's parents died and she was instantly recruited by a trainer who taught her classic MK Ultra programming (an infamous CIA mind control program). She learns about drugs and techniques in how to seduce and slay. The sociopathic dudes enjoy hunting women in the woods for sport. While the overall way it's portrayed is not realistic, it recalls royal families in England and elite families in America back in the day who would hunt individuals for sport and ritual. Consider Jimmy Savile who allegedly supplied kids from shelters for noble and exclusive families in Europe. This is where the concept of The Hunger Games hails. It's reality. Elitist snobs would hunt youths for fun and have them fight to the death for sport. Another obvious flaw is: How could the young lads get away with murdering myriad innocent girls for so long, particularly when you consider how overt they are about luring the prey into their web. Moreover, one of these ignoramuses would've surely spilled the beans at some point, but they're all so cavalier about their dirty deeds. If the handler (Bentley) knows about their diabolical frolics in the woods, wouldn't the police? THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia.

" Has potential but mixed thoughts
",0.0,0.9294,2018-01-16 00:00:00,5,"I didn't see the trailer, but found this browsing the recommendations through Netflix.
I have very mixed thoughts on the different aspects of the film. It does have great potential from the plot. Straightforward and to the point. From the beginning, Veronica is being trained as an assassin, thought you don't know why. I would have liked a little backstory to find out why. There are just references to the teacher having endured his life falling apart due to family being murdered which is great motivation, but it doesn't shed light on how his trauma connects with the plot of Veronica trained to specifically target the 4 boys.The plot of getting revenge on the boys and their ""sport"" has great potential, but has some story missing on why the training was specifically for them considering her training began as a child and by the time she's fully trained, she's the same age of the boys she's targeted as... There's something missing to that. If it's specifically to target them, the training started YEARS before they even began their own ""sport"" of luring and killing, so nothing is explained to her specific targets.The cinematography is beautiful. The lighting, coloring, and set design was beautifully done. It's obvious that the lighting is a very artistic way of highlighting the action instead of the usual cinematography, but if you view it from the indie artistic viewpoint, you can definitely enjoy the lighting of the set, and the vivid colors, and the highlighting. It definitely is stunning.The action sequences are well acted, though the writing has much to be desired. The actors did well with what they were given, but there's not too much depth other than what is said, and the effects of how Veronica extracts her revenge on them with bringing out their worst fears as she attacks.Overall, well done, stunning lighting, and training. But... there's a lot lacking in the way of specific motives for why these boys if training started in childhood, and no connection between them and the teacher. Very under-developed in that sense. Focusing on the boys and their ""sport"" without scenes of their every day life does help focus on their actions though, so it's obvious that they are menacing and deserving of the revenge. But the straightforward plot, though it is direct and to the point, is lacking with the connections underneath the surface."

",0.0,-0.9529,2017-12-23 00:00:00,6,"This is a revenge/slasher film with a difference. It is a very strange series of events presented in a deceptively straightforward way. Why do a group of well-groomed young men lure young blonde girls into a forest and murder them? It is implied they killed the parents of Veronica (Abigail Breslin, who was 16 when this was made). It is also implied they killed the wife and daughter of William (Wes Bentley), who becomes a surrogate parent to Veronica. How did they get away with these, and other, murders when their activities are so blatant and notorious and they make no effort to disguise themselves? Also, these high-class killers would surely have been nothing more than children when they killed Veronica's parents.Why does William take the trouble to manipulate Veronica by training her to be an efficient killer in order to despatch these lads when he could just as well do the deed himself, or simply inform the police? Equally, the pack find nothing suspicious in meeting a young lady so na√Øve as to agree to a date with four young men she doesn't know. As the audience, we are either not expected to wonder about such things, or the writers consider such questions unimportant.The moody atmospherics of the piece distracts from the lack of details and gives a faintly surreal quality to events. The gang take time to get to know Veronica whilst sitting on rackety chairs and sofas in impressively backlit woods.There are vagaries and elements that could have been explained more, and the pacing could have been more involving. But I don't see these things as lapses or plot-holes, rather-more deliberate artistic decisions that stop the film from ever getting all 'cosy' or familiar in its telling. A choice has also been made to ensure this is gore-free, despite the expectations a film with this premise attracts. It is almost as if the production distances itself from the story being told. The results are pleasingly odd."

A girl trained to assassinate four frat boys who assassinate girls. Why? We never really get a reason. It's not like they had a secret society that was difficult to infiltrate. I found it really hard to take Abigail Breslin serious at any point in the film and her trainer was equally as cheesy (I've appreciated his work in other projects.. but not here). It felt like the entire film was a sentence long and they did everything they could to fill in the gaps around it so it hit the 90 min mark. Frankly it could of been a brilliant 10-15 min short film... but stretched out over 90 minutes was almost painful. I don't want to discourage people from viewing it.. every film is an accomplishment and you really need to make your own judgement, but for me this was a loss.I will say the Frat boys stole the show, great group of actors stifled by mediocre writing. Hope to see them in other things!"

Later on she is facing guys who pick her up, with the intention of messing her up, and how she deals with that does not feel sick at all.The concept of a kid being reared for specialist 'rough tough' tasks has been covered well by Saoirse Ronan in Hanna (2011), also a bit in Violet And Daisy (2011). Add the big name quest series, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. Most definitely D.E.B.S. These do a good job in showing such roles as potentially damaging and Final Girl only gives hints of that. What it does have is some of the putridity of such an education, plus the final exam. Except that the exam itself feels weak, as if it is just a carrier for some hidden but rewarding story."
" This may be an unpolished gem.
",0.0,0.9316,2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie is one of the reasons why you should never make decisions based on online reviews. I expected to see a crap movie. Instead, I've got a decently made thriller that feels more limited by budget than by scope.Let me explain. In my humble view, the world wants to see a good vs evil fight. They want to see the bad, evil characters and the good, moral heroes. Well, in this movie you get a bunch of bad psychopaths vs what can be considered a good psychopath. From a pure moral point of view, everyone is out there. There's no politically correctness. You get the cold, efficient killer that acts as a mentor. Wes Bentley plays the role of the emotionally repressed teacher extremely well. You get the emotionally damaged girl. Abigail Breslin plays her role very well. She knows nothing but to kill and yet, she's battling with the fact that she's a growing teenager / young adult. Then you have your classical high school jocks / psychopaths. Here is where the movie goes wrong. Veronica and William feel very authentic. It may not be what plays well on the big screen but as someone with a background in psychology, it feels that it hits the spot and that the behavior and approach is consistent. The jocks are just caricatures of what the bad guys should be. Overly arrogant, coming from a rich family, power driven, overly inflated views of themselves. The director tries hard to make us hate them and yes, they are despicable but they feel very two dimensional in the end.So should you watch this movie? Yes. It is a good movie. The problem is that it is too short. There is way too little character development to actually care about anyone in this movie. It feels like they've cut a lot of scenes that would connect the plot. We don't know WHY she must kill them (apart that it is a test and it is the right thing to do) or how this relates to our enigmatic mentor. We don't know what is Veronica's final purpose and mission and the ending is more style than substance (plus, it makes no sense whatsoever). I feel like Abigail and Wes' acting alone is enough to see this movie and believe me, this got and kept my attention a lot better than the 6.0+ flicks on IMDb. Is it bad compared to what could be a very intense thriller? Yes. Is it worth a 4.7? No. It feels like an unpolished gem and it is easier to put this movie down because it is not formulaic and can make people uncomfortable than because it is badly written and directed.So yes, watch it. It's worth it. It will leave you wanting more but you won't feel like you've wasted your time."

William could have done it himself in a heartbeat. And what were the police doing in this town where more than a dozen young women have already disappeared? It's hard to believe no one could figure out who was at the bottom of it. As for the girls themselves: by the time several have already disappeared, is the next potential victim really going to agree to get in a car with four guys at night and drive off to wherever they decide to take her? And when she does, nobody remembers that they are the last people she was seen with? You can enjoy this movie, maybe, if you want something to fill up time with your brain in neutral, but otherwise there are just too many holes."
" Final Girl has no developed story
",-0.296,-0.979,2017-08-18 00:00:00,2,"The movie Final Girl is a kind of a psychological cult film genre. The young girl sits opposite an adult man in a police station interrogation room at the beginning of the movie. This young girl is not like other girls her age because she is not emotional at the loss of her parents. In fact she is stone logical. This set of logical is noticed by the male interrogator whom then takes the young child and develops her into a killer. The male adult determines the 4 young men that the now 18 year old woman, with physical and psychological training needs to take on as some kind of a test of her violence. The 4 chosen young men are no doubt bad men however both sides: the woman and the 4 men all were lured into each others traps - each was going to kill the other side. To me this movie was not properly developed because the young girl, who is the main character did not have any character development. The viewer could not really feel an emotional connection to the girl because she appeared to be void of emotion."

The premise is so unpleasant and sickening it makes Hunger Games seem tasteful. She is so unconvincing as a fighting machine trained to take down some boys who hunt girls in the forest. This is no Kick Ass with it's humor and novel action. Things proceed glacially till a very silly and weak looking set of fights. Final Girl feels cheap boring and badly acted. Don't bother watching this.
" For badly implied reasons a little girl is adopted by an assassin and trained to kill four murderers
",-0.9201,-0.9963,2017-08-07 00:00:00,1,"SPOILERS This film left me with a lot of questions and I've come to realize that the answer to every single one of them is ""because it is a dumb and senseless movie."" Here are a few for you to sample: How did these murderers who are in high school kill William's wife and daughter over ten years ago? Did they kill them when they were 6 years old? Why doesn't William just kill them himself or turn them into the police? Why are they waiting ten years to train this little girl while other women are being murdered when they already know who the killers are and could stop them? Why does Veronica have a crush on William? He adopted her when she was a little girl and is basically her father. Isn't this messed up? Why does William tickle her? That was so weird! Why do they choke out that random guy at the bar? Why can't she just shoot them? If a gun without bullets is a paperweight why can't she just take more bullets? Why isn't she allowed to wear shoes? If she's going to drug them why can't she just poison them? What woman in their right mind would wear formal attire and drive into the woods with four men they just met? Why does it take her so long to kill these bozos when she's been training for ten years and they are drugged? Why is this guy so scared of pandas? I thought she wasn't allowed to use a gun so why does William shoot the last guy? Why didn't he shoot them ten years ago? If he was there the whole time with a gun why was he letting her try and fist fight them to death when he could have easily killed them? Who made this movie? Who reviewed the script and thought ""this is good""? How was this disaster ever made?"

By the end of the first scene, you know how the movie ends. You know as much about the character motivations as you ever will. You know as much about the character personalities as you ever will.Every tactic in the action scenes is ""pay-off"" for something that happened earlier.

Exactly what you think is going to happen happens. And it happens exactly how you think it would.I think a much better movie could be made using nothing but editing and turning some of the early scenes into flashbacks. That could add tension. It might allow the audience to have a brief moment where they are worried about the lead. A tiny second to suspect that she was caught off guard and not completely prepared for what was happening. Anything to create the tiniest bit of tension about anything that happened.For instance, there were several dream sequences due to drugs. Some were clearly not ""real"" within the movie, but others were believable within the context of the movie. Those might have been a tab more convincing if they hadn't already shown the effects of the drug, the preparation of the drug, and the actual administering of the drug to the targets.This seems to be a movie for people who are easily confused by plots existing.+2 stars because hot, tough girl with post-tussle scratches and relatively non-exploitative trainer."
" 'Final Girl' Tries to Flip Tropes of Slasher Movies
",0.0,-0.959,2017-07-08 00:00:00,5,"In the context of slasher films, the term ""final girl"" has a specific definition. It refers to the last character ‚Äì almost always female ‚Äì left alive to confront the killer. She tends to be a virgin and/or remains fully clothed and eschews smoking, drinking and drugs. Finally, she is usually a brunette, often in contrast to a promiscuous blonde who is killed off.But mostly that's not the case in the 2015 thriller Final Girl, starring Abigail Breslin. Her antiheroine Veronica may be a virgin, but not for lack of effort. Liquor and hallucinogens are among her weapons. And she's very blonde ‚Äì all the better to draw out her prey.Instead, the film's Netflix synopsis gives away the whole story:""A group of sociopaths that's been killing girls in the woods for sport sets its sights on a teen who turns out to be a trained assassin.""Oops.Did they make a prequel film about Helena from BBC America's Orphan Black? Or perhaps a horror/comedy, something along the lines of Club Dred (2004)? Nope, Final Girl is neither of those.In fact, the synopsis tells a potential viewer all he or she needs to know. There is nothing for me to spoil: no twists, no context and little suspense for a thriller.The first half concerns Veronica, an orphan, being recruited as a child and trained until young adulthood by mysterious handler William (Wes Bentley). A stripped down version of 1990's La Femme Nikita, it offers no explanations of why or for whom.In the second part, William puts Veronica in the field to take down four high-school ""bros"" whose idea of fun is to lure a pretty girl into the forest at night for a radically simplified version of 1932's The Most Dangerous Game. There is no real hunt; the guys just run after the girl until she tires or falls, and then kill her.Never explained: why they are on the case; how William knows about the killers; and the necessity of having them avenged by one of their prey. The locals are aware that girls are missing but aren't motivated to ask the most basic questions. Law enforcement is not in the picture, literally.So what does the film offer?Director Tyler Shields presents a small-town slasher movie through a noir lens. Much of the film is set at night, at a classic diner or in the woods. Veronica's training appears to take place mostly in empty warehouses. The girls wear prom-like dresses while William and the boys wear black suits. The characters drive classic cars from the 1950s or '60s. It's all very pretty, in a dark sort of way.Filtered through the noir, the plot has a past-among-present setting ‚Äì kind of like Whit Stillman's Metropolitan (1990) without the delayed reveal. Meanwhile, the dapper brociopaths exchange pretentious dialogue ‚Äì like the Life & Death Brigade from Gilmore Girls, but homicidal.The result is a mildly interesting perspective on the slasher genre, but not interesting enough to overcome a story that plays like it came in a two-page outline rather than a fleshed-out script.The other thing Final Girl offers is an outstanding performance by Breslin, who has been criminally underutilized recently as whiney Chanel No. 5 on Fox TV's Scream Queens. She carries the plot and even manages to mine a little humor, betrayed by a glint in her eyes. It's as though her precocious preteen character from Zombieland (2009) got older and more dangerous.If you are a real cineaste who enjoys exploring variations on common genres and tropes, you might enjoy Final Girl. If you're looking for entertainment on a Friday or Saturday night, watch Club Dread or Zombieland instead.###Stu Robinson does writing, editing, media relations and social media through his business, Phoenix-based Lightbulb Communications."
" Could have made a good TV show pilot.
",0.4404,-0.7802,2017-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Unlike many reviewers here, I didn't hate this film. It had a strong visual style with great use of colour and light, it had a good concept and some interesting characters. Unfortunately, once you know the what and the why of the film it plays out exactly as you expect. It doesn't offer any twist, or complexity. I was surprised that the movie chose to show us all it's cards right out of the door. All of the background information on the lead could have been done as a flashback after she been put in danger, or after the first kill. This sort of mid-story revelation would have given the story a little more punch. My biggest disappointment was that despite spending a lot of Time with Veronica I was left wanting to know more about her. She was interesting and her story arc just seemed to be beginning. I think this movie would have been much better as a TV show.If the story could be condensed into 1 hour (easy enough to do given this film's slow pace) it could have been the set up for a series. Like Dexter but with a Young Female lead and an assassin instead of a serial killer. Each episode she could have killed some killers, kidnappers, psychopaths, gangsters or other scum. And we'd get the chance to see her get more confident and powerful. We could also see her relationship with her mentor develop. Perhaps it ending with them falling out and her tracking him down as the last kill of the season. At the end of the day, I enjoyed this film well enough, but will not likely recommend it to anyone. A missed opportunity."

It has the makings to have been really good if they'd gone the horror comedy route - ridiculous evil bad guys, an absurd, doughy, 'deadly' assassin who looks like she couldn't beat up a twelve year old nerd, and an over the top, cold-hearted, steely-eyed mentor.

" Not your average revenge/slasher movie, I liked it
",0.4215,0.9935,2017-05-11 00:00:00,8,"I am probably going to be a bit provocative here and say that, in order to like this movie one has to rise above the expectations of this being just another mindless revenge/slasher movie where you park your brain in the lobby before sitting down.If you keep your brain in gear, especially the artistic part of it, you might like this movie. The plot is simple enough, perhaps a bit illogical at times, but it is wonderfully implemented from a cinematic point of view. Some people have referred to David Lynch when reviewing this movie and there is indeed a ""Lynchesque"" feeling over it.Personally I found the movie beautiful. I read some people saying it was too dark. Well, I guess I am glad that I got my new OLED TV in time to watch this movie since I am sure my old LED-LCD would have struggled with the many dark scenes. On the OLED the image was wonderful though. The somewhat eerie night scenes were so enjoyable to watch. Yes one could of course nitpick and say the lighting was unnatural but come on, the entire story was a bit far-fetched so just enjoy it for what it was, a nice piece of imagery.The story is a bit weird. A guy who has gotten his wife and daughter killed by a set of psychopathic young men trains a (very) young girl for years to take revenge. That is of course a bit convoluted. Why not just wack them himself since he seemed to know what he was doing when it came to inflicting all kinds of hurt? Okay, I get it, because the script writer thought that would be too boring. Fair enough.The actors are doing a decent job in the movie. The lead character is maybe a bit too much of a baby-doll character but she is still doing a good job of her role. The four bad guys are doing a good job of being creepy and sadistic. There are plenty of unanswered questions though. For example, how did he get his hands on the girl in the first place?I actually think the movie was a bit short. I guess it was a bit short on money as well and maybe it is related. Anyway, I feel that, once the ""hunt"" had started that more could be done with it. When the ending approached I felt it to be a bit rushed to be honest.Bottom line, I liked this movie. It was cinematically beautiful, a bit weird (in a good way), somewhat creepy, and decent enough story- wise. Maybe it is really a bit short of four stars but it is closer to four than to three."

Also, while the Trainer was proceeding slowly in his vigilante cause, other young women were being hunted and murdered by this gang. If he knew who they were, why wouldn't he just go to the police with his information so that these young thugs could be stopped and innocent lives saved? If he wanted to serve the kind of rough justice they deserved, why couldn't he just do it himself? Why did he have to train a child, create a killing machine, and in doing so destroy her life, when all he had to do is take a gun and shoot them all. Seems kind of cowardly to me, that this guy would not only allow the torture and deaths of young women to take place over years, and then get another young woman to do the dirty work. I think the real bad guy here, was the Trainer."

Not just that, but that's the movie he starred in just before this one! Look it up. Then don't watch this boring turd.The story is totally unoriginal. We have seen it time and time again. The 'gang of crazy people hunting someone' and it is just not cool. Or interesting. It's stupid and boring. The first time it was done, should have been it. And yeah, they have thrown in some other stuff, unfortunately ALSO stupid, boring and not cool at all. I also hate that very little is explained. Why are any of these people doing these things?She is supposed to be this bad-ass? She totally sucks at fighting. They couldn't give her like a couple of weeks of training? When she is supposed to be fighting, it looks like it's the very first time she has ever put her fists up. Lame. The acting is alright. The movie looks decent. The ""action"" though, if you can call it that, is really dull. Choreography is super crappy. Editing is crappy. It just sucks. I was very annoyed at the end.

The premise, as in the initial blurb under the title on IMDb sounds mildly interesting. Unfortunately neither of the actors nor the director manage to bring any nerve to this flick - which in the end turns out to be violence for the sake of violence. The characters are shallow, the plot is fairly pointless, the background is non-existing and Veronica is mildly successful for a trained assassin to finish her task at hand. The gang of four has their Clockwork Orange moments (like when they assemble to hunt Veronica) but they are far between and nothing is made of it.Abigail Breslin is cute, but that is honestly the only reaction this failure manage to provoke. If you've got some time to kill it is a passable alternative - but there surely are more enjoyable films in this category as well."

As a teen her training leads to a test mission: To kill a pack of boys who hunt and kill girls for sport. A lot of the origins of the characters and how the situation came about are left unanswered. This probably explains the problems so many of the other reviewers have with this film, as they likely thought they were thinking they were going to see a twist on the slasher genre based on the description of the film.This film doesn't explore its own premise or delve that deep into the characters. It is much more about the style and presentation of the events, dialog, and visions. Given how most of the characters both protagonist and antagonist are sociopaths to some degree, that strangeness, aloofness and lack of reality is somehow appropriate.It's not too long a film, just over an hour and a quarter, just enough for what it is trying to do. Worth it for change of pace. Horror fans may be disappointed, but I'm not one of them, and was pleasantly caught by surprise by the whole Twin Peaks like vibe that emerged from this film"
" Even Human Centipede was better than this!
",0.4926,-0.8578,2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie is the definition of a waste of time. Unless you are trying to learn how to make a bad movie, in that case do what these guys did! So bad I couldn't stop watching :( who wasted their time and money making this?!?!? Like this is a real movie? Plot, acting, every scene with an over saturation of light... complete garbage. Even human centipede was better than this! Was this made in North Korea or something? I felt like the 17 year old girl was going to take advantage of her 40 year old instructor the whole movie. That's some creepy kidnapper with a van reversal crap right there. Hey Mr. 40 year old man who has known me since I was like 5, can I come sleep with you?!?! And if he has been with her for 12 years now, why is he just now teaching her these assassin moves? Like, what have you been freaking doing for the past 12 years????? This is probably the very worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. And I have watched a butt ton of movies these past 70 years."

",0.0,0.976,2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"The storyline is not bad, even though it is a very familiar concept, but it was not developed smartly enough with scenes and twists and all. The characters are fine, but I was not convinced with the casting. Not everybody, only Breslin. I have been watching her films since she was a child artist, only her recent film are not that great, or even simply good to appreciate her involvement. I blame her choices of the film and its filmmakers. As for this, it's clearly visible that she's not physically suitable to do such role. This kind of film is for Chloe Grace. For me she's more a Disney product.The other actors were not bad, especially those four fellows in the negative roles. There's nothing to talk about Wes Bently, he was like in a guest role. When it comes to the film story, it does not make any sense at all. Okay, training a person from the very young age to be terminator is very interesting for a film. But when the assignment was given to that person, as per how it all took place in this film, I thought it was unnecessary. Because it could have been dealt in an easy way. So just for the film, they took the hard way and shed some blood.Happy part was, the film did not look so boring. The setting was too dark, they avoided other unrequired characters to enter into the frame. So to focus everything on those few ones and made an attempt to shape up the film as much possible best. I would have liked it if it was a little better in some sections. In the end, I'm not fully satisfied, so I don't think it is worth a watch. Instead, you should check out other similar concept films like 'Hanna', 'Nikita' et cetera.4/10"
" Top class cinema, don't watch if you fear a women beating a man.
",-0.6597,0.9081,2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I loved the heroine. She was simple in manners and method, succinct rather than clumsy though, most definitely still in touch with her higher self. This film depends on you the audience to fill it out as it is very artistic and does not pad itself out. I found it hauntingly beautiful and measured throughout. The violence is not OTT though the events are the worst possible in the human world. The idea of a killer girl set on a mission is not vacant but admirable and the smattering of ideas as to where she would get her strength from and what kind of person she would be, well it is nerve jangling. Don't try this at home. She supposedly is highly efficient, but is she flawless too? There are insights into what makes evil and how to remain good. Insights folks, remember. A great film. I feel it is good enough to be anti real life horror; A film with a social conscience."
" Dull, hokey, needlessly stylized
",-0.4019,-0.9954,2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"An ordinary story that could have been a 1970s Hong Kung Fu revenge movie about an acolyte who is finally ready to leave the monastery to avenge the deaths of her parents, glasshoppah. But the execution us dull, filled with stupid pointless dialog that does nothing to help. It has no tension no suspense. It has no background no framing no pacing. On top of that the plot makes no sense at all. How can a gang of teenagers be killing people for 10 years? Then there's the art direction. The movie is filmed in 3 colors: black white and red. For some unexplained reason all the men wear black suits or tuxes, white shirt black tie. There are no other people sounds objects animals or cars on the world and the everyone is acting like they just fell out of an Andrew Dice Clay routine doing their worst Frank Sinatra impersonation. I don't get it. It's trying to be a Frank Miller comic strip or something. Who knows? At any rate the whole movie is a lead up to a single bizarre chase and fight scenes that completely falls apart into a mess of hallucinations for no reason."
