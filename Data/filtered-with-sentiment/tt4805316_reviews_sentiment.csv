" A deep meaningful occult horror classic!
",-0.4003,0.7883,2021-04-03 00:00:00,9,"This is a great occult horror film. The trailers dont do it justice. If you are in to occult horror films this is a modern classic with a fantastic ending. The acting is great, the style in which its shot is nice and smooth. Both the tone and settings are perfect. You will find yourself researching if this has ever happened in real life and what you find may shock you. The plot is Loosely based on and made famous by Alistair Crowley. Its a very deep film all in all. Give this film a go if you occult horrors. It may be slow but its building to a wonderful ending."
" Grieving and mourning
",-0.7351,0.6486,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,It is a wonderful movie honestly. Get in the open-minded mind set. Don't go in thinking this is an all out paranormal movie full of spooks and scares. It is very psychological.
" Waste of time !!!!!!
",-0.6083,-0.8652,2021-02-14 00:00:00,1,I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life this film is so boring and slow doesn't deserve 1 star. Watched until end to see if something happens very disappointing ending for a pointless film.
" Spoilt by the last fifteen minutes
",0.0,0.9524,2021-01-12 00:00:00,4,"Oh boy this film was good until the film makers wrecked the movie by trying to be to arty in the last fifteen minutes of the movie.
Up until then the movie was very good.
When a film is carried by one or two actors then they can either carry a movie or not and this time they did.
Both male and female main actors in this movie were brilliant.
I would have given this film six or more if the film makers didn't try and be to clever when trying to end this film.
A film of two halves, first half very good.
The second half to arty for my liking.
The last bit in the room when the woman sees her......you will have to see the film, I am not going to give anything away, I laughed out loud and I wasn't the only one. Spoilt the film badly."
" Creepy setting with good direction and a bland ending

She purified herself for rite. For love. To make someone love her. A ginger bald man seems to be the one to do it. She lost his son and wants to speak to him and that's the true reason and then she convinces him. He says it's dangerous. It might last 6 months. He's secretly taking alcohol and lying to her. She buys the supplies while he checks the geographic directions in the house. Her sister is scared Sophia is doing sth wrong and she wants her to stay away.
They sit by the fire in the garden under the Milky Way. She takes a walk out in field and saw a dead did while he encircled the house with a white substance and after that there's no leaving the house. She said seal it. He's being too aggressive and bossy. He made her eat some poisonous mushroom and she got sick to cleanse for the ritual. 6circkes are drawn for 6 realms. And different rooms represent different emotions. She focuses on the stone and fasts without leaving the circle for three different rooms. She fell asleep and as an alternative way he makes her drink his blood. His sons toy is missing. She dreams her son with an old woman. He wants her to take off her clothes and stand in front of him while he's masturbating but he couldn't ejaculate and she got mad and she put her urine in the pot and made him eat it. She wanted to leave because nothing's happening and he warned him this is dangerous. She turned back and the ritual goes on drinking blood soaking her on the shapes. She confesses that her son was murdered and the culprits were never found and she wants vengeance. After that he was furious and want to purify her in the bathtub almost drown her and revived her. After that a knife stabbed him and she took it out and stitched him. He said this was the sign that her guardian angel is at work. He got infected and they lost track of months. She heard her son from a room but it was not him. And she left the house and she walks but returns to the house like in vivarim. The man was unconscious on the floor and the demon takes him. She sees his son with the old woman and the demons took her too and cut off her finger and she ran away everything goes bright and she sees her son in the room as a giant gladiator (and he turns out to be her guardian angel). She wants the power to forgive and he smiles. She puts mr. Solomons body in the pond by the house wrapped in plastic and left the house in his car. The cinematography was great the scenery in the country was splendid and she is a great actor but the ending was a bit bland as I expected her to take a bloody revenge on those murderer occultist that killed her boy."
" Meh.
",-0.0772,-0.4296,2020-12-05 00:00:00,4,"It starts well but leads up to nothing. There are no scares here but it does have a decent atmosphere and good acting. The ending is the worst part. It's a slow burner that leads up to a boring feel-good ending that's apparently supposed to move you to tears according to some of these reviews but for me it just made me realize that I had wasted my time. This is more of a psychological drama, not a horror nor a thriller, maybe if I had come into it expecting just that I'd have appreciated it more."
" A Dark Song Indeed
",0.0,0.6771,2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"A somber, unsettling, slow-burn horror film/tale of redemption. I honestly had no idea what to expect going into this film; I didnt look at any reviews or read any synopsis before pressing play. I wound up being very pleasantly surprised. For a debut film from an indie director this is a huge accomplishment. The acting, writing, and overall mood is excellent. I had no idea where the story would ultimately lead, which kept me uneasy and on my toes for most of my viewing. My only gripe with the film would be the pacing. As much as I enjoy a slow-burn film (Rosemary's Baby comes to mind as being comparable to this) there were a couple sections where I felt the film straining a bit against its 90 minute runtime with several scenes that could have used some trimming. Having said that, this film is a definite recommend for me. If you consider yourself a horror buff, dont sleep on this one! Cant wait to see what the director puts out next."
" Low budget movie
",-0.2732,0.6025,2020-12-03 00:00:00,3,"I don't know what people liked about this movie. The movie is slow, dark, low budget. Whole movie is in some house, two actors doing some boring rituals. Nothing really happened! I almost fell asleep. Don't waste time. Only good thing about film is the soundtrack and that's it."

" Dull
",-0.4019,-0.3402,2020-09-10 00:00:00,2,"The plot is quite interesting and the acting from the grieving mother is very realistic. I could feel her pain through the screen. The overall movie is innnnnnnnncredibly slow and even though the ending was visually very surprising it didn't help much. The ""creepy"" ghosts of the wrinkly old lady and little children didn't at all fit with the overall vibe. No idea what the filmmakers were trying to do but they certainly haven't accomplished it. Don't waste your time here. There's nothing worth seeing."
" Intelligent and so different
",0.4588,0.911,2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,One of the best movies I've seen that did the wow factor at the end. I don't want to call it horror because it is but it's also beautiful believe it or not. Revenge or Redemption.

",0.0,-0.7169,2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Do not trust the well paid reviews. I did that and it was a big mistake. This is definitely not a scary horror movie. It is childish and immaturely produced. A low budget indie film which is noticeable. In addition to the stupid plot, it is also very difficult to understand the actors because they speak with a strong London / Cockney accent unless English is your mother tongue. Avoid at all costs."
" I never heard any songs
",0.0,0.679,2020-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Why the high rating, anyone's guess. For me, no chance.Its starts of pretty slow, and it just never gets there, where ever there is. I kept watching as there were times I felt like it'll kick in...but then dropped again.Basically, without giving it away, this woman wants to see her son again, who died. So, she enlists the help of an occultist to read and perform a load of rituals. But that's about it, its just reading stuff, throwing some water over her, reading, pacing around, having an argument, him being dominant.....and then the ending is, er...er...hmmm.Some say its good, I'm not one of those. But if you have seen the trailer, its nothing like that. As usual, they string all the intense scenes together, and voila, a trailer."

" Really Good Horror!
",-0.268,0.7705,2020-06-09 00:00:00,8,"I was so pleasantly surprised. This film had so much detail and foreboding atmosphere. Nothing over the top happened. Just a nice, slow, paranoid build and a payoff that did not disappoint for a change.If you're a fan of the occult and demons and spirit worlds and dark rituals, this movie is for you.It has an appropriate, albeit somewhat cliché score. Very nice settings, effects, performances. There are some bumps in the road plot wise, and I do wish I could have seen it with subtitles because I was not sure what was being said at some points, but overall, very good, unique horror movie."
" Could have been GREAT
",0.7034,-0.8215,2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"A Dark Song could have been a truly great horror movie except for two annoying aspects, both related to sound. The first really falls on actor Steve Oram's delivery. While Oram is certainly a fine actor, there were many times when his speech became unintelligible, making it extremely difficult to follow what he was saying. Secondly, the overall sound production was substandard, especially when the female lead was conversing with her deceased son. Again, unintelligible and very distracting from the overall film.
Really a shame, because it was a very unique take on the horror genre."
" Garbage

" Outstanding.
",0.6124,0.1779,2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"In all respects. The two handed script and single location only serve to invite the viewer to populate the gaps with imagined scenarios.
Deeply involving. Genuinely scary,but largely because it transcends the divide between Horror and Thriller via well documented psychological fact.
A genuine rarity."
" Oh dear NO, don't put yourself through THIS!
",-0.1593,-0.9706,2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"For all but the last 10 minutes of this film it's basically two people isolated in a remote country mansion trying to create a spooky atmosphere but failing miserably. Very little happens, it bored the socks of me to put it politely and it's full of mumbo jumbo about summoning angels/demons which with 10 mins left on the clock the main character manages to do. Here we get a few special and slightly disturbing visual effects thrown in to what is otherwise a pitiful attempt at a horror film. Not worth the wait and I was left wondering why I waste my life on such films as this, I could have watched Emmerdale with more enjoyment!"
" A thoughtful story using the occult - but not to all tastes.
",0.2023,-0.9679,2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"The premise of this story is straightforward enough: having been failed by the legal system for the murder of her child, a recently bereaved mother turns to an occultist to seek revenge on the child's murderers.The film avoids all the stock in trade special effects, supernatural cliches, that we have grow accustomed to in traditional occultist films. The tension is slowly built as she is instructed to undertake numerous ordeals over several months for her wish to be fulfilled.This is a terrific account of an occult ritual. The interplay between the occultist (Steve Oram) and the bereaved mother (Catherine Walker) is mesmerising. Wonderful performances. Yes, it is a slow movie, but at the end of it I felt that I had watched something substantial, something that had a deep resonance. The sense of the mother's loss and her desperation are palpable. And there is something in both characters to elicit our sympathy and rejection. They both come across as deeply real with flaws and strengths.This film is described as a horror movie, but it isn't in the traditional sense, although it has its scary moments. It doesn't quite fit into any established category, and that's why I think it excels. It takes the occult genre by the scruff of the neck and gives it a well deserved shaking. All the scenes work well, although I am in mixed minds about the ordeal of pain enacted by demons. On the other hand, this could have descended into gratuitous scenes of violence and sadism, which other films too greedily feast on as a selling point. It does have that 'Marmite, test to it: you will either love it, or hate it. I thought it was a great movie; thoughtfully written, with sterling acting.I'm disappointed that a lot of horror genre fans didn't like this movie. This is as close to magick and the occult as you will see in a movie. The strength of this movie is its ability to create atmosphere. You will either go with it, or reject it. I went with it."
" Don't believe the hype
",0.0,-0.9239,2020-05-15 00:00:00,4,"A slow burn on occultism that fails to build any sense of tension. Tries to make up for it at the end, but its ambition to be deep falls terribly short in idiotic imagery. Don't believe me, see for yourself."
" Very creepy, very disturbing, and very good, 'A Dark Song' represents the best of British horror
",-0.0422,-0.9558,2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,"A determined woman enlists a damaged occultist to perform a ritual that will enable her to speak to her deceased son. Containing perhaps the most elaborate and meticulous ritual committed to film, this supernatural horror is all about its build up. It guides us through a detailed ceremony of dark magic and mysticism, teasing us with the dangers of invoking things not meant for mortal eyes before unleashing unbridled terror.Impressively crafted, well-written, and featuring very eerie sound design, the denouement is just as good as the build up. When you unlock the door to hell, you have to be prepared for evil to sneak through, and the atmospheric dread this instils is pervasive and unsettling."
" What a terrible waste of time!!!
",-0.7767,-0.8441,2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so unbelievable boring, maybe if you are looking for Drama or something, Maybeee you would like it. Where is the Horror in this? The Story could really have some potential, but instead it is just 90 min of boredom. Just terrible!"
" Hell Yeah

" A masterpiece! My favorite horror of 21st century
",0.5707,0.9241,2019-12-31 00:00:00,10,"A Dark Song gives me so many different feelings everytime I watch it.The photography and the music make this film to be dark and creepy in a beautiful and deeply introspective way.
Since the beginning it's very easy to connect with the main character given that her motivation, dialogues and acting are really cohesive.If you're interested in occultism, look no further because this one is for you. I don't recall other film that portraits the The Book of Abramelin so true to reality neither that has treated an occultist ritual so darkly and convincingly as A Dark Song.Superb screenplay and acting.Oh, and I've seen that some people disliked the ending. For me it was pure magic. One of the first times that I watch a horror film that not only gives me the creeps that I was hoping for, but also makes me feel emotional and stunned.
Thank you Liam Gavin for this cinematic jewel."
" The Best Movie About Magick/The Occult Ever Made! & A Work Of Art!
",0.6988,0.9982,2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I am shaman and sorcerer and expert on the occult myself, as well as a film buff and videographer. And I can say with full confidence that this film is not only a serious work of art, but that this is the best movie on Magick/The Occult ever made. It is one of my favorite movies, not just because I love magick and the occult, but because it is an incredible film masterpiece. The directing and cinematography, the scoring, the writing, the acting, and the aesthetics of the set are all so amazing that they are just breathtaking.This movie easily beats its competition because most movies on magick are either straight horror films where a demon is killing everyone, or teen witch films. And most films on spirituality are these lame family films with a christian theme. So it is easy to beat those movies, but this film goes so far above and beyond them that nothing could possibly prepare you for what you are about to see.First of all this movie is based on a real actual magick ritual called ""The Abremalin Operation"" or ""The Operation of Abremalin The Mage"". The ritual is the largest longest most elaborate ritual in existence. Even larger than the largest festival of ceremonies and rituals done at Hindu Temples like the one I belong to, which can last weeks. This ritual lasts months, between 6 and 18 to be exact. Yes it really is that long. And that is why it is called an operation, because it is actually comprised of many different ceremonies/rituals and tasks/endeavors and other procedures and undertakings all together. The goal is to come into contact with your guardian angel so that you can communicate with them and ask them to grant you a wish. And this groundbreaking movie chronicles one woman's doing the Abremalin Operation in full...with accuracy and detail that you have never seen in a movie on magick before, as all other movies about magick are not realistic at all.The woman and the man she hires to do this with are two normal people anyone can relate to. The woman is someone you empathize with because of the fact that she has lost her son who was murdered, and she wishes to be able to speak to him again. So you really care about her and her cause. But you will come to find out in watching the movie that there is actually more to it than she would lead you to believe in the beginning...which leads to some twists that will put you on the edge of your seat. The actress that played her actually said that she was holding her breath when she first read the script and got really excited about doing the movie. So you can just imagine how exciting it will be to watch.To portray this ritual they got a house that they created different magickal realms in each of the rooms for, each decked out with their own symbols and magickal elements. The aesthetics of this are just awe inspiring. And it helps that the film makers had to actually do this in real life. This is not some set built in a movie studio. And the directing and cinematography is incredibly well done as well. And pairing the visual aspects with the audio aspect of the films scoring creates the perfect sense of atmosphere. The sounds and music they use in the scoring give the sort of ""slow burn"" effect creating a calm creepy intensity and power. Much like in ""There Will Be Blood"". I love the feeling that the sounds they use give.The actors do a great job as well, which of course they can only do because the film is so well written. And it is written in a much different way than most horror films. In fact I wouldn't even call it a horror film, and neither does the actress who plays the main character. I would call it a fantasy film with horror elements. Most horror films have moments of surprise that make you jump in your seat, this doesn't. They also have a tension build and release cycle that repeats over and over, and this one also doesn't do that. They will also tend to have comedic releif, again, this one doesn't. What this one does have is a slow steady constant profound ominous build up of suspense that culminates throughout the entire film and keeps gripping you and never lets go until the very end. Making it quite intense at times, even though its not really an action movie and also isn't really scary so much as creepy. But that is the art of this film. There are some scary horror type of moments in the film but they are isolated to the very end. So horror movie fans will still enjoy this film, but people who don't like horror will also enjoy it. In fact the actress who played the main character said she doesn't like horror, but really loved the idea of this film. And it also has a beautiful ending too.This film is one of my favorites. One of the only films out there that I have seen multiple times and can never stop thinking about and wanting to watch again and again. It is a real serious masterpiece that I hope many people out there see and goes down in history right next to Francis Ford Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula. Easily a 10 out of 10."

" Impressive occult slow burner
",0.5106,0.974,2019-10-17 00:00:00,7,"A grieving mother rents a large, isolated house and employs an occultist to undertake a gruelling set of magical rituals so that she can contact her dead, 7 year old son.
The idea of making a film of which most of the running time focuses on magical ritual is excellent, the occult being a topic that has always fascinated me.
As other reviews state this is a slow burn but it is very well made and the two main characters (both played excellently by Catherine Walker and Steve Oram) make for compelling viewing. He, the occultist, is rude, foul mouthed and frankly common, whereas she is well spoken and well educated. They are like chalk and cheese but this is what helps make their relationship so interesting. The house itself is creepy, the location is bleak and the fantastic musical score just elevates the moodiness.
There is in horror movies a saying that less is more and this is true for most of its running time. However, when demons are actually visible near the end I felt that it did lower the film very slightly, not quite the brilliant ending that I was hoping for but decent none the less."

This is NOT a horror movie OR a thriller so if that's what you are looking for, this isn't it. I would classify this as a psychological drama and a good one at that. Extremely well-acted.

I only happened upon it by chance and I'm glad I did because if you have the patience this is a film that will take you on a journey of the unknown, one which you'll blindly follow and be rewarded for your time.

" ""Everything Has Consequences In This!""...
",0.0,0.7263,2019-09-18 00:00:00,8,"Sophia (Catherine Walker) purchases a huge house in the Welsh countryside. It's the perfect house for her purposes. She has been preparing for an upcoming event for quite some time.Enter Joseph Solomon (Steve Oram), who is the right man for Catherine's requirements. Willing to sacrifice anything, Catherine employs Joseph to use his knowledge and experience of occult practices, in order to communicate with someone she has lost. After a harsh cleansing regimen and lengthy pre-ritual exercises, the true ordeal begins.Going along with -almost- everything, there is one thing that Catherine will not do, one part of herself she will not surrender, something she hasn't told Joseph. This proves to be... problematic.A DARK SONG is a supernatural horror film about vengeance, its cost, and the power of redemption. A sparse production, this movie relies on its two main characters to carry it, along with a rigid adherence to detail concerning its subject matter. There are some nice, otherworldly surprises and a double shocker of a denouement!Recommended for those who enjoy a mysterious, slow-burning story that doesn't reveal all of its secrets at once..."

If that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed.However, if you have experience with religion or enjoy learning about the real ways people believe in Magic, this is a beautiful and truthful telling of those teachings. It's atmospheric and takes you on an emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual journey. It's reflective and poignant.

" FANTASTIC movie with the WORST ending.
",-0.128,0.9915,2019-07-12 00:00:00,5,"I love all type of horror movies, but I am particularly creeped out by ""slow burns"" like this one appeared to be so I gave it a try.This movie started out great. The story was engaging and interesting. I loved the subtlety with which the scary moments were shown. That is my favorite type of scare. I really hate it when the movie shows you the scary ""thing"" because it never seems to live up to the frightening image that you've already conjured up in your mind. I loved the relationship dynamic between the two leads as they traverse the increasingly complicated ritual. I loved how there were subtle moments randomly breaking up the ""realism"" of the world of the movie....
...and then I saw the ending.Man oh man, I have never seen an ending so completely at odds with the rest of the film. That has got to be the stupidest depiction of an angel I have ever seen. I really want to know who approved the ending of this film. I wanted to laugh out loud as soon as I saw it which completely undid any of the fear that I had experienced throughout the rest of the movie. It would have been better if they had just used light and not shown any real physical depiction of the angel, why couldn't it just be LIGHT! It would have been so much better! I really would have loved to give this movie a higher rating, the only reason I didn't give it a 2 was because the start and the middle was so strong. But seriously, what a terrible ending. Nice job y'all. Thanks for that."
" Misinterpreted ending to a great film...
",0.4215,-0.9943,2019-07-09 00:00:00,7,"As most people have already mentioned, this is not a horror film. This is more of a psychological horror/ thriller flick. The premise of the movie seems to be grasping at any kind of demon invocation in order to summon ones guardian angel in order to be granted a request. Reviewers have suggested summoning kings of hell, etc. but painting japanese characters onto a person's body doesn't seem like something you'd do to invoke a demon based on a European religion. Now, the reason for my review. Sophia states pretty early on in the film that she doesn't do forgiveness. She makes her intentions known that she seeks vengeance and suddenly Solomon is injured. She states she wants to watch that person die in the most terrible way (she gets to). Solomon's wound festers and he suffers an agonizing death before being dragged away by a demon. The reason she asks for forgiveness instead of vengeance is that Solomon is already dead and she wants to finally move on. He also asks her do you think I had anything to do with it? (Her sons death). I think people are perceiving a twist ending when she really is getting what she asked for. She shrugs off his questions about her son's death changing her story every time. Kidnapped, occultists, etc. And we already know Soloman has failed this ritual with two other people. Rewatch this film and think about it, I will..."

They will then both be allowed to ask the angel to grant them a special favour, but their attempts to contact the dead through witchcraft lead to something even more terrifying. A Dark Song offers atmospheric and unsettling horror over blood and guts and marks writer-director Liam Gavin as one to watch. It is virtually a chamber piece with just two primary characters, and is imperfectly realized, but the way that it dives into the black arts with methodical restraint and escalating unease still make it worthy of its ambition."

I gave it a 3 because of good cinematography, there are some interesting shots, but other than that it really falls flat. So much time is spent building tension, with no climax.

The way occult working was presented, is really close to the real thing here. For people who really do that kind of stuff, it's lots of meditation, chanting and slow proceeding like in the movie.

It makes everything easier, the script, the sense of place, the characters, it´s all simple and focused, able to play around with small details.

Characters want to haunt the crap out of that house, so there´s a great feeling of anticipation all the way, but the third act pays off, it doesn´t lose focus, it doesn´t go out of its mind, it´s just a great fim and I´ll say it once more, the soundtrack is awesome."

We're talking about something completely new here, revelaing us that Irish know how to create solid horror movies. As I mentioned there's no cheap attempts to scare you. The plot is unfolding nightmarish slowly within a suffocating environment provided by the remote rural house, where our two main characters are isolated in order to peform a dark ritutal. The character development is excellent, the acting is also excellent, and specially Steve Oram gets his chance to proof his amazing talent.
As the plot continues, things are getting darker and darker, tension rises and in the end it's certain that you'll find yourself trapped in a morbid, sinister atmosphere waiting for the end, sharing the same horror with our two main characters.

But when I finally saw The VVitch, I was pleasantly surprised! The VVItch was really good actually. And yeah, it's probably not exactly horror either. I would call it more of a thriller - but my point is - slow-burner movies with a slow pace CAN be really good if done well.So I thought...if people are saying the same about ""A Dark Dong"", maybe I should give it a shot. Bad mistake.It's slow alright....Because Nothing. Happens. It starts out promising with good realism and acting. But halfway through you are starting to realize that - well this movie is going nowhere. It's one boring ritual after another with some bickering between the two main actors. That's about it. No scares. No suspense. No feeling of dread or unease. None of that. Just a boring drama about two people in a house trying to do some dumb rituals. Topped with an ending that makes no sense.Don't waste your time on this. This definitely not horror. It's a slow drama trying to be artsy and appeal to film hipsters. Avoid!!"
" How To Haunt A House In 666 Easy Steps!
",0.126,-0.9383,2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Geez Louise! And people think following Jesus and letting him do all the work of transformation is hard! Get a load of this film and maybe you'll think again. I would have given this one a 10, but the spirits manifesting as zombies at the end of the story was a cheesy move on the director's part. Besides that unnecessary diversion, we watch as two blundering humans (aren't we all?) attempt a deadly Black Magic rite or spell in order to get something in return from demons or guardian angels--and they don't seem to care which it is. But amidst all the rituals the trust between the two, which was never good to begin with, deteriorates into deadly tit-for-tats which result in two deaths, one of them irreversible. And people actually practice this stuff. At the beginning we hear the practitioner tell the woman who wants the spell performed that his main reason is to know--to have knowledge. Sounds just like the mistake made in the Garden of Eden to me, and we're still following our original Mother and Father instead of our Mother-Father Jesus of Nazareth who killed the old human nature on the Cross--being the Tree of Knowledge--so that we can all be transformed into new creatures through his Presence--through the Water and Blood which flows from his heart-womb as we are born from above; born again. How's that for magic, eh? And a whole lot simpler than starving oneself and drawing elaborate arabesque designs and circles with chalk and having ritual sex (well, sort of) and consorting with demons and the dead just to get a little revenge on some wayward teenagers who themselves set out to do some Black Magic and only succeeded in killing a little boy--and making his mother desire their deaths through--you guessed it--a Black Magic ritual.

Basically, the promise of a journey wasn't kept. What happened was: 1. It started building momentum slowly. 2. Then there was this revelation in the first half of the movie that led me to think things were going to take a turn. 3. Then it kept the slow momentum, where I was struck with the miserable realization that no ending could mitigate the time spent trying to make sense of the mindless sequences riddled with lots of needless distraction, little and irrelevant conversation, and music coupled with sound effects that served to slow things down rather than render atmospherically immersive scenes. 4. Then the journey through 5 realms were curtailed and compressed down to two corridors of pathetic demons, and other beings hereafter, and an incredulous scene of struggling to move along, never mind all the ditched references and potential arcs that could have added dimension to the story. 5. What followed was the best scene the movie had to offer: the sort of refreshing imagery which in itself was not creative but rarely used. You are finally offered a meaning, and maybe a nice one at that. You actually feel that coming -what she set out to do and ended up doing-, so when it comes, it does so with no surprise, which by the way, doesn't sully the intended outcome.The movie has this tense, sad, almost grieving simple violin theme all along, regardless of when it matters. This causes an ongoing feeling of being shortchanged or let down.The idea was good, the cinematography was fine, the music was also fine. What ruined this movie was the slow tempo addled with utter mess of a fodder. You can use both in a movie and still come up with something interesting enough, if not memorable. When you abuse both, however, it just doesn't work. It backfires, and what better indication of this than checking the time bar to see how long until it's over? This is spoiled milk and keeps you thinking how much better it could have been. It feels as if the writer and the director just did not care enough. A botched film with bloated short film material.

The dialogue and interaction between the main characters, Sophia Howard and Joseph Solomon was spot on. These are emotionally flawed and vulnerable characters and their pain seems real. The climax of the movie could have been a bit better laid out, but all in all, I was engaged by this movie on an emotional and intellectual level. I am eager to see more roles by both Ms. Walker and Mr. Orin. Again, they took a mediocre plot and acted the ""Hell"" out of it, pun intended."

A perfectly chosen story for the location (although highly inaccurate as regards the Abramelin ritual) instantly pushes this movie to the level of Rosemary's Baby, The Wicker Man, The Exorcist or Night of the Demon and grants it cult status.Slowburn scares and ratcheted up tension with the CGI big effect saved for the end (which is perfectly produced, in my opinion).You can watch this one over and over again and get more from it every time.Possibly one of the best explorations of dark spirituality ever committed to celluloid.A near-perfect foray into the abyss of the human soul."
" Bland, boring and incredibly dull offering with a few decent moments
",-0.6478,0.8308,2017-11-16 00:00:00,3,"Heading out to a remote house, a woman signs on to join a friend in staying at the location through an arduous series of tests in order for them to perform an occult ritual inside which soon tests their resolve and patience as they wind through the exacting ritual.This one was a rather bland and overall uneventful effort. What really tends to downplay this one is the rather dull pacing found here that just doesn't offer any kind of excitement for a large portion of it's running time. This mainly consists of them engaging in dull conversations over long periods of time that don't really amount to anything as the lack of urgency or intensity in what they're talking about doesn't generate any heat in the matter so it comes off as incredibly dull. It doesn't help matters much that these are portrayed as being so cryptic that it never really has a chance to build to anything since the entire purpose or meaning on their activities is kept away from the viewer until incredibly late in the film so what it means to have him go through the decorations in the different rooms or the language difficulties throughout here don't really serve any point. Even the few digressions outside the house at the beginning are quite obvious as they're utterly unnecessary to see in the film and it gives a profound sense of filler in time during the story that didn't really need to have happened since it just eats up time here that it desperately doesn't have. There's no reason for the film as it is to be as long as it is which is due to all these rather bland and action-devoid activities taking up the running time that it feels as though nothing is actually happening in the film which aids to the bored feeling here. This is the main problem with the film as it doesn't feel as though anything is really happening and the horror-based happenings are kept to a minimum for large sections of time being filled with extraneous, non-horrific versions of horror-based actions. While these here hold it back, it does have some enjoyable parts to it. However bland they may be to see play out, the fact that the majority of the first half sees the series of tasks that must be undertaken in order to successfully accomplish their goal does serve the purpose of starting their ritual. They don't make much sense but it does serve the overall goal of providing the foundation for the steps they take in order to keep pushing forward in their antics as the gradually escalating series of scenes do provide this with a dark feel once this changes into the darker practices. To be as precise and detail-oriented as this is with its different performances and tactics that are carried out along the way does have a dark and spiritual tone about the proceedings and it does spend the majority of this time with the two of them engaging in rather detailed activities. The only other bit that works here is the rather strong finale which is way too obvious about its intentions but has a rather eerie and more traditionally horror outing than anything else committed in the film thus far making it the film's best feature. It's not enough to really save this one, though.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Violence."
" Didn't care for it
",-0.3875,-0.9103,2017-10-31 00:00:00,2,"A DARK SONG is a British indie horror flick made with limited resources. Almost all of the tale is set in a dingy old house occupied by two characters, a woman who is desperate to contact her deceased child and a volatile occultist who tells her he knows the ritual which will allow her to do so. What follows is one of those greyed-out, slow-burning tales with a lot of sitting around and a lot of time spent in the company of a pair of unsympathetic characters. The incidents which do occur are quite unpleasant and depressing. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of Steve Oram after seeing him in this and SIGHTSEERS; he always seems to play cold characters with little acting involved. The script mistakes profanity for wit and is one f-word after another, which soon becomes monotonous. The ending is as predictable as they come too."

It shows the swings between total belief in what she is doing and not believing it at all. The portrayal of a plunge in to madness to realise that what she wants is actually different to her initial intention is the little twist at the end.I can understand those reviews who say the ending is a bit wishy-washy and ought to be re-written but for me it worked.Hope this hasn't spoiled anything for anyone.Enjoy.

It wants to be a horror movie but at it's heart, it's really just a drama about a woman coming to terms with her loss. It's like watching Steel Magnolias except the ex-husband is a zombie and the family are witches. The saddest part is that we are more sympathetic to her counterpart than to her. It does get points for cinematography, and set design. The occult parts are very cool."

Now to the point. I mainly do independent so I watched this when it came out. I liked the story and I thought the characters were interesting. I also thought that the end had some very pretty shots. What I didn't like is that they took a great story, but never delivered it. It was very slow moving and any suspense that started building would eventually die since there wasn't a lot happening. Nothing really happens until the very end so the first three quarters are in vain. That being said, I still don't think it's a bad movie. I think it has an excellent story and is certainly worth the watch just don't expect any action or fast paced typed horror. It's more of a super natural drama or one of those character coming of age tales. When you get to the end you will see what I mean. Just don't go into this expecting any super scary scenes or anything like that. It does have more of a subliminal message like in most Indie flicks, so if you don't like anything beyond blood and action scenes you probably won't like this either."

It dispenses with the idea that the occult is ""happenstance"" or summoned at the behest of a glass upturned on a Ouija board. No, if you want to summon the wotnots, then you have to work for it. Not hours--or days, even--but months of dedication and deprivations.My only niggles with this film: first, its ultimate ""message"" about forgiveness and that in getting there, we are never told what really happened in the first place. I grant you there is a lot of innuendo in such regards, but not enough detail to feel entirely comfortable with the outcome. Second, I thought there was one scene of a sexual kind that was frankly over the top voyeuristic, and not needed anyhow. That aspect of titillation felt like a ""cheap"" shot. So two points off.This said, the entire team should be congratulated on this work and also their being innovative on a low budget to create a film which feels much bigger, taking the viewer into a type of world where one can begin to understand that thankfully, to summon the spirits, requires a helluva lot more knowledge, effort and stamina than Hollywood would otherwise have us believe..."

It doesn't involve the over-hyped ghost as seen in most Hollywood productions, therefor there wasn't enough money. But don't worry, if you like your flicks dark and full of references to masses and Satan then this is your stuff. No effects, and it did what it has to do.

" Subtle and powerful
",0.4215,-0.9808,2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"It makes such a change to get a supernatural movie that makes the viewer use their imagination, rather than bombarding them with CGI and men in rubber suits. This is a study of the old chestnut, 'Be careful what you wish for'. A young mother whose son had been murdered, seeks revenge on his killers via a magic ritual invoking angels. It's clearly influenced by the ""Bornless Ritual"", an invocation used by Aleister Crowley to summon his Holy Guardian Angel and the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage which Crowley attempted at Boleskin House on the shores of Loch Ness. The ritual allegedly requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life. Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, when he was called to Paris by the leader of the Golden Dawn. According legend,he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House. But I digress.There have been reviews that bang on about how slow this movie is, and it's lack of pace and excitement. But if you have any understanding of the supernatural, and this movie has been meticulously researched, you'd realise that the real horror lies in fear and what happens in your head. This woman, who so craves revenge, is on her own personal spiritual journey. She realises, at the 11th hour, that revenge and hatred offer nothing but pain and emptiness, and that forgiveness, both for her son's killers and herself, is what she really needs to find any peace.I liked the dynamic between the woman and occultist, the loathing and disrespect, the sharing and mutual need. There's one really funny moment where they both share their recurring dreams.The film is subtle in its suspense and horror, with a nice slow build and some really creepy effects. The ending seems a bit clichéd, but was saved from being corny by illustrating the power of forgiveness over revenge, and good over evil. On the whole, one of the better horror/supernatural movies of 2017 so far. I loved it."

Where the two people assemble to do some kind of ritual to open the door for the dark force, as well as opposite to that with a reason. Very challenging attempt, had to go through many troubles in the process. But how it all turns out, whether they achieve what they were planning for is what takes us to the final stage where it comes to end with a tiny twist.This is an independent Irish film. Feature film debut for the director. I don't recognise any of two actors, but they were good. Under a small cost, the film had a better quality. Well created atmosphere, the suspense kept the narration to go all way to the finale. Except the opening, the following parts lagged in any kind of development, but once the final act had begun, the scenario had changed and favoured to end high. I would say, that's what saved this film. Otherwise, I was getting ready to bash it. Yet not the best ending, an acceptable one regarding earlier section of the narration.

Unfortunately, I cannot, because of a final 15 minutes or so that suggest to me that an otherwise deft screenwriter must have passed on the task of closing to somebody else who unfortunately, lacked imagination.Much of the film was moody, tense and played psychological games with the viewer. I was speculating at more than one point that the occultist was a twisted, dangerous charlatan with a deviant sexual fetish that could only be sated by absolute control over, and humiliation of, his sub. Had the movie continued down that story line, ending in the death of one of the two main characters at the hands of the other (with no more than a passing nod to the possibility that something supernatural was at play), then I would have been raving at the genius of this film.Sadly though, the plot careened off the track of psychological trickery and landed with a thud on well-worn territory of actual monsters and the tired cliché of somebody escaping only to wander around in a circle and arrive back at the scene to an ending that made no sense and seemed to be sloppily tacked on to an otherwise well done, original, first 80 minutes or so."

The two main characters are damaged material, each in his/her own unique way. You soon understand this cannot bring anything good, the lies, the emotional instability, changing motivation ... all in the middle of this unnerving opening to the other world process. Catherine Walker gives a great performance. The bad: it builds up very slowly to establish a great promise, only to disappoint in the end. Initial effects and demonic presences are very convincing, however when things are supposed to go downhill we are treated with a bunch of wrapped actors-pretending-to-be- ehhmhm damned souls? Demonic spirits? In material form? Should have used some old fashioned effects instead. The final scene made no sense to me...Forgiveness, really?

I have been wowed by, recently, by TRAIN TO BUSAN and THE DEVIL'S CANDY, and now we get A DARK SONG, though I am going to say right off the bat that this is probably not a movie that is going to appeal to everyone, or even to every horror fan. The majesty of this film lies in the careful crafting of its' spell, both figuratively and literally, weaving an intricate pattern of subtle nuance that builds power as it goes, until the spell is ready to unleash its' true nature.Okay, enough with the hyperbole and bad metaphors. The plot summary pretty much sums this up for you. A woman seeks out a man who is skilled in the ""dark arts"", asking him to help her craft a spell that will give them each their one, true desire. This is true occultism, too, real Aleister Crowley, mid-90s issue of HELLBLAZER type of stuff. We are not talking about the weird goth in your class who calls herself Wiccan. This isn't THE CRAFT or some other teenage understanding of bookstore wizardry, not is it the red cloaks and devil head ceremonies of a movie like THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. No, this feels real right from the beginning. The spells they are seeking, the methods they choose to obtain it. All of it feels real. It's very important to the nature of the film because the entire setup depends on this spell. This is where the patience is required. Many scenes have little action to them, but we are building towards something. We are learning about our characters, who they are and the lengths they will go to achieve their ends. We are learning about the spell, the sacrifice it requires of each of them and the dedication to it. Horror fans love to talk about the ""slow burn"" and this definitely fits that description, but many films pigeon holed into that category are interminably slow, with a five minute payout. This movie starts to reap rewards sooner and have them last longer. There is a creeping edge to this movie that lingers under your skin. The anticipation of what is coming, of what lurks in the shadows, draws the viewer in so stealthily that there were scenes that I was, quite literally, waiting with baited breath to see what was going to happen, tensed at the fear of what I was about to see.The final twist, like any twist, will either agitate viewers or enrapture them, but in my opinion is a fitting coda to everything that preceded it. The movie is about the dedication to achieving what we truly want. Sometimes, we don't really understand what it is that we want. Sometimes, we are surprised by our truest desires.This is a smart, well-crafted movie that not all horror fans, or film fans will enjoy. If you are willing to give it the space to breathe and the time to tell its' tale, and seek it with an open mind, it really is worth the investment."
" Loved it
",0.5994,0.9458,2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"It was engaging. It draws you in. Acting was really good. It is unusual for a ""horror"" type movie to be so good. This is no slasher. Not predictable like most of the movies about summoning devil /dark rituals etc. I did not expect much but I was positively surprised. I specifically signed up to give that movie a good review as it deserves it :)"
" Excellent Smart Horror film
",0.4019,-0.8487,2017-05-11 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The two actors were very believable. The soundtrack and cinematography were excellent. I know the budget was small but it didn't feel like they cut any corners here. I felt genuine discomfort at times- which is the goal of most good horror films. As with just about all movies, there were some plot holes, but these did not take away from the overall experience.Warning: Spoiler Alert for remainder of review:---------------------------------- At the end, I thought the guardian angel/Being was impressive and actually gave me a chill when I saw it (really weird reaction for me because I rarely get chills)- not because I was scared but it just seemed strangely authentic to me- not that I have any knowledge of what such a Being might actually look like. The Being said two lines to her. Version I saw had no subtitles. Does anyone read lips?? Or does anyone know what was said?? I think the second word of the first line starts with a W but I can't make it out. I really would like to know!"
" Great Set-up but Fails to Deliver **SPOILER**
",-0.2846,-0.4657,2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"I can say that I really liked and was excited about this movie as it's premise began and the plot developed. A damaged woman with mysterious objectives and an occultist delve into a long and dangerous ritual. It's original and had me pulled in. It just doesn't deliver in my opinion. I had fears that the plot would meander into a gray uncertain area where the viewer wasn't sure if the characters were witnessing something supernatural or were purely delusional by the climax of the movie.*****SMALL SPOILERS***** While I'm thankful the movie didn't go in that direction, I still felt the story just fizzled out. There were also a number of missed opportunities, in my opinion, to have more character interaction of interesting occurrences.One scene where the woman leaves the protection of the circle surrounding the house, was a let-down and a missed opportunity. In stead, I found myself fast forwarding through uneventful and silent scenes of her walking around rather pointlessly for long period of times with no dialog or purpose. I would have liked the story to reveal a more twisted plot and obvious one was dangled before us in which the occultist was involved in the cause of the woman's suffering but the story doesn't go there and closes the door on that possibility after hinting at it. Sadly in the end, I think that I'd rather have seen that conclusion than the one that was filmed."
" Awesome recipe, half baked result
",0.6249,0.8901,2017-05-09 00:00:00,3,"A Dark Song is one of these movies where everything is set by the ambiance and the claustrophobic dimension of its writing. Taking its time to expose its core, it manages to keep viewers on its toes during half its length, making them forget about details that should in all logic ruin the suspension of disbelief. Unfortunately, passed that point, it becomes clear that the movie fails to deliver, losing its identity somewhere between psychological thriller and slow paced horror. Where these two genres could have blended together to create not only an almost original approach to horror/paranormal in the manner of The Babadook or as a darker, much more grounded, ascetic version of Pan's Labyrinth, or even as Identity with an occult twist... it just falls flatThe lack of dramatic climaxes, consistency, and an extremely clumsy third act gives the impression that the writer created the rules of the movies' universe as the story was progressing. Some would argue that that A Dark Song is meant to be appreciated more intellectually than viscerally, but too little is exposed to trigger any reflection, yet too much is revealed to leave some room to the viewer's imagination.The cherry on the half-baked cake is a very disappointing ending, which seems to belong to another movie altogether.There are redeeming qualities: the scoring, disturbing yes not annoying, fits the ambiance perfectly, and the acting is all in all pretty good (probably the only reason why some scene retains a certain level of intensity).If you're in need of some slower paced horror, give Uzumaki or Kairo a chance, but skip this, there are many other, better ways to spend 130 minutes."
" Two Annoying People Yelling at Each Other for a Whole Movie
",-0.4019,-0.941,2017-05-06 00:00:00,4,"I really wanted to like this movie, especially as it has a great trailer and a really interesting concept for a horror film. However, it completely failed in the delivery, as the whole film is essentially just two incredibly annoying people yelling at each other while they walk around a slightly creepy house. I even hesitate to call this movie a horror or a thriller, it's really just a drama film with a couple creepy moments and a supernatural theme.The basic set up for this film is that a woman wants to conduct a ritual to summon angels and demons to ask them a favor. To facilitate this ritual, she hires a sexist douche bag occultist to boss her around for a couple of weeks while they're alone in a house they can't leave. Almost immediately the film is incredibly hard to enjoy as the occultist is a giant douche, and the woman is a total bitch. The director doesn't even make an attempt to have these two people be likable in any way. It wouldn't be too big of a problem, except that the two of them are in almost every single scene together for the whole movie.I also hated how the movie took a relatively long time setting up the rules for the rituals they're about to follow, and then it doesn't really seem to follow them. The rules keep changing, and it gets even goofier when the woman keeps changing what she wants out of the ritual, lying repeatedly to the occultist. Also, there's multiple scenes that seem completely out of order, as there are scenes where the ritual is obviously working, but in the scenes afterwards the woman complains about it not working. Specifically, there's this beautiful scene where she's sitting in a circle with all of these golden flakes appearing out of midair and raining down on her. Then in the very next scene she attacks the occultist because the ritual hasn't started working yet. It just doesn't make any sense.My other biggest problem with the film is that it's no where near as creative as it could have been, as the ritual was removing the house from the real world, and bringing it into the world of angels and demons. However, all we ever hear are thumps along with some demon pretending to be her dead kid, and all we ever see are goofy humans in weird dirty outfits. There also aren't really any scary moments, which could have easily been achieved with the setup of the film.Overall, A Dark Song just isn't a very good movie, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

" So much potential but alas...
",0.0,-0.3102,2017-05-06 00:00:00,4,"It had a good premise and potentially solid characters. The story was poorly developed, though, and the plot suffers from ""stupid nonsense happening because the characters couldn't bother to ask about or ensure a simple, normally inconsequential thing"" syndrome. The latter really gets to me. On top of things happening because the screenwriter said so and some loose ends dangling away through to the end for no particular reason, it was SO FRICKING SLOW. I don't mind a slow pace when time is devoted to character or story development or building suspense, but I saw none of that. All of this I could have overlooked if there was anything actually scary in the movie.So in the end, one star for making me watch to the end, one for the premise, one for the one good thing that happens towards the end, and one for the ending. There, four stars."
" It was a really good movie ... Not sure I liked it.
",-0.0261,-0.6859,2017-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I was constantly worried that this movie would end up being a psychological thriller with no horror pay-off. My paranoia of being ""M. Night Shyamalaned"" by a ridiculous plot twist probably added to my indifference toward the film's ending. However, there was a huge payoff at the end, and this is a good movie that is also utterly original ... It just wasn't that scary. The scariest part of this movie was that gnarly Staff infection the guy got in his stomach. Watching him succumb to Toxic Shock was terrifying - That's some scary stuff that can actually happen.Side note - I found the fact that she changed her ""favor"" at the end to ""the power to forgive,"" b.s. She should have followed through with her plans of vengeance, or asked for a superpower or something . It was an extremely dark movie the whole way through, then in the last five minutes, turned into a corny redemption drama."
" Very Worthwhile
",0.4005,0.9729,2017-05-05 00:00:00,8,"It has already been said that this film is a slow burner and given the subject material that comes as no surprise. What does strike me as unusual about this film, is the level of detail and the way it avoids the usual pitfalls associated with films of this ilk. The start is full of miserable and depressing but strangely beautiful scenes accompanied by an excellent dark and foreboding score. I am full of intrigue and expectation partly because I have a passing interest in the Occult and have read a few books about these sort of practices and partly because the acting, dialogue and directing commands it. This continues into the middle of the film and whenever things start to get a little stale or my attention wanders something either meaningful, intriguing or shocking happens to call my attention back to the screen. Towards the end I did fear that this was all coming 'unstuck' however I was to be proved wrong and the finale was excellent and I was more than impressed that we actually got to see what was conjured and it was not a big let down as I feared but looked strangely 'authentic' - not that I'd know. I'm very happy with this film and I am still thinking of it days after which is always a sign of a good watch. At the very least this is a very well made film. Congratulations to all involved."
" Not that dark and the song played was OK.

He was like Patton Oswald, but to be taken seriously (Which was hard to do in the fishing hat he wore). It was like he was a occult geek or something. He has that persona of a Trekker for the supernatural.Not as scary or disturbing as I would expect. Most of the film is more about doing a realistic built up of what it's like to prepare to communicate with powerful beings from the other side. It's interesting, but only if you really like that kinda stuff.It has it's interesting side watching the story progress, however. It feels like it may have worked better as a comedy on the occult, and ironically it's seriousness makes it hard to take seriously.Otherwise,very slow by fun to watch if you are into it.http://cinemagardens.com"
" Intriguing slow-burn film, didn't love the ending
",-0.5216,-0.9048,2017-05-04 00:00:00,6,"As other reviewers have noted, if you're looking for an ""Insanitarium""-style splatter-fest then this film is not for you. The first hour of ""Dark Song"" is a mysterious, deliberately-paced psychological thriller with two interesting characters stuck together in a house for months, feeling each other out. An occultist (Joseph) is trying to help a woman (Sophia) contact her dead son. This requires dark rituals, fasting episodes, and sleep deprivation. Their motivations and honesty are both in question, leading to plenty of dramatic tension. What's real, in terms of both past and present? Who's lying to whom? The film takes its time exploring these questions, and for the first hour at least, the viewer's patience is well-rewarded. I especially liked Steve Oram's occultist character, who doesn't fit the classic mold of ""actor"" or ""hero"" one bit, and is all the more fascinating for it. I won't go into deeper detail for spoiler reasons, but suffice to say that both characters fall into the logical traps of mistrust, manipulation, and frustration after being cooped up for so long.My problem with ""Dark Song"" was its ending. It made sense from a dramatic standpoint, and of course there were several directions it could have taken. The fact that I wasn't satisfied doesn't mean you won't be. But along the way I had some really freaky ideas that I hoped would be explored, and they weren't.In any case, I still recommend ""Dark Song"" as a mature, well-made, and disturbing psychological thriller."
" A cerebral dark occultist tale with a horror element
",-0.5719,-0.9891,2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Horror movies come in many forms. Some are about the gore, some are about the creatures, and some are just plain disturbing. Though i like many a horror film with those qualities, a true horror fan of the genre also has to appreciate the horror films that try to get under your skin without trying have someone's face ripped off. A Dark Song may be subtle but it is a horror tale nonetheless. What makes this a gem is the ride to the climax. With great performances from the two main characters and it's haunting score it's able to create a tense dark atmospheric mood so that when the horror elements do begin to appear it makes them far creepier than most films with a bigger budget. Most horror movies can be compared to other horror movies because they're filled with the usual clichés but this is a unique horror film with a redeeming quality that is very rare in films of this genre..if your looking for a movie where people are being chased by monsters or tortured by inbreds then this movie is not for you..but if your looking for a horror movie with an intelligent approach then turn down the lights, get your popcorn and let this movie work its magic"
" Excellent! The best horror since ""It Follows""
",0.6696,-0.4745,2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"Perhaps it isn't fair to call this a horror movie since there is little horror. It is more an occult movie and one of, if not the best, I've ever seen. To many horror fans it will seem extremely slow and lacking in gore, but the slow build of tension and suspense is really unique and the music adds to that, powerfully. I haven't looked yet at who scored the movie but it is masterful.Spoiler below:And the climactic scene was handled as well as anyone could handle a meeting with -- what -- god, or an angel.End spoiler.This one will last in my memory for a long time and I'll be rewatching it. I think it will be even more enjoyable when I already know where it is going."
" After a terrific opening, it just slows to a crawl
",0.4767,0.9543,2017-04-30 00:00:00,4,"I was really looking forward to A DARK SONG since I had heard so many good things about it. However, after a terrific opening, it just slows to a crawl. It is one of those films that you watch hoping for something, anything, to happen. (It reminded me of the equally dull yet great to look at I AM THE PRETTY THING THAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE.) It has tremendous talent in front of (Steve Oram and Catherine Walker) and behind the camera (Cathal Watters); every shot looks like a painting, the acting and dialogue are pretty flawless, but the further it goes on, its aimlessness becomes apparent and it seems director/writer Liam Gavin just didn't know how to end it or where to end it.I think it's being mismarketed, too. There are zero--and I mean zero--scares in the film. While the atmosphere keeps building, there is never really a payoff and the ""feel good"" ending sort of torpedos the premise of the film.Great trailer, just not at all the film I was expecting."
" Great build-up, weak payoff
",0.296,0.8592,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"The first 2/3 of the movie really built-up the premise, like a good, slow burning indie. Good performances by the two leads and great use of the small budget to create the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many films, the great beginning starts to meander and lose steam. The end, too, is exceptionally weak, considering how well the film starts off. Could have been great, but will have to settle for ""almost there""."
" The journey of a desperate mother
",-0.3182,0.3105,2017-04-30 00:00:00,9,"I stopped watching horror films a long while ago because our friends over the pond in the USA have sadly lost all originality and creativity in this genre (if they ever had much anyway...) This film is refreshing and actually credible within its framework. I need to warn you, the brief moments of 'horror' in this film are not the glamorized US format of predator/bogeyman/demon/force creating fear and deep angst in teenagers/stereotyped weak women/vulnerable victims (oh help the makers please!) This film, like the sipping of a good brandy, needs time. It slowly imparts its story as it builds its characters. As the viewer, you are allowed to ponder, to percolate your own thoughts and to wonder about spirit, humanity, darkness and light.The film is essentially about the desperate lengths to which a loving and broken mother will go, for her lost son. But its real story is about the mother's own transitional journey from a dark, angry and hopeless state into that of achieving an acceptance of her loss.Acting, direction, photography and sound is top notch and because of this, you are drawn into the film three-dimensionally. As I mentioned before, this film takes time to grow. But if you have ever loved or lost anyone then get yourself quiet and connect to its story. Well done to the director, crew and cast, and thank you."
" No horror
",-0.7096,-0.9716,2017-04-29 00:00:00,5,"A grieving mother hires a spirit guide to cast a spell in an effort to contact her dead son - but her deception threatens to spoil the effect ...Plenty of technical quality in this two-handed drama. The photography is good, opening with a gorgeous skyscape, the editing keeps us chopping along at a good pace, and the cello music is moody and well judged. But this is pitched as a horror and never hits its stride. The concept is well introduced, the tension is maintained, and the sense of isolation is never broken - but horror needs to convert the metaphor of internal struggle into a literal fright, and this story just flounces off with some lame mysticism, influenced by Catholic guilt, without once causing a gasp. The obvious opportunity to convert the heroine into a villain wasn't explored, and by the time she triggered the climax all interest had drained from the experience.The lead actor gives a solid performance, but the director doesn't let her add much sex. Her partner is patchy, and I think both actors struggled with the dialogue, which bounces around like a rubber ball, with poor Q&A scenes that prevent the characters from establishing decent rapport.Overall: Well produced, but the story fizzles out at about the hour mark. This has state funding, and I suspect the genre was used to add some commercial sizzle to an ordinary concept that wouldn't otherwise have attracted attention."
" Occult chamber drama of spiritualism and serious rituals at your own risk
",-0.34,-0.9456,2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"A young mother has lost her small boy and can't get over it. Desperate about getting in touch with him by any means she engages an occultist who knows something about rites. Together with him she seals herself up in an isolated house way out in the country to concentrate fully on her quest, but the occultist is not very easy to get along with and not very sympathetic either. He keeps warning her, but she is determined, they go through with the ritual, and nothing happens, except what none of them had bargained for, although there was plenty of money involved.Of course, you must raise objections to this kind of film and the way they irrationally act in mumbo-jumbo that could go anything but right. Still, it's a very interesting film, and ultimately there is some catharsis to the ordeal, as she reaches the one thing she desires, which is fulfilled. It's a very suggestive horror film, reminding of others of the same kind like ""The Blair Witch"", ""The Witch"" and ""Repulsion"", and the story finally makes sense. It's a very odd film, I can't really recommend it, and once you have seen it you've had it. Extremely well made with sound effects that add to the tense horror momentums, you still have to acknowledge it as a very interesting study in the efficiency of self-suggestion launching you into the infinity and nightmare of the occult."

Along the days, Sophia follows the guidance of Solomon in rituals to purify her soul. However Sophia has a hidden agenda that jeopardizes their lives. ""A Dark Song"" is an independent low-budget horror movie by the unknown Liam Gavin. The boring and theatrical screenplay is promising until the awful and messy conclusion but goes nowhere. The only good point are the performances of Catherine Walker and Steve Oram, but it is not worthwhile watching this film. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
" A bit slow for my tastes, but it has its moments
",0.0,0.6029,2017-04-29 00:00:00,5,"A DARK SONG has an uncomplicated plot line. A woman wishes to take revenge on the people who stole and killed her child and wishes to employ supernatural powers to do it. To this end she rents an appropriate house in the middle of nowhere and hires an expert in the occult with the expertise to make it happen.The basic mechanics of acquiring supernatural assistance is the execution of occult rituals, excruciating and difficult, painful and sometimes embarrassing, in complete and highly focused isolation across a period of months that will culminate in the summoning of an angel that will be able to grant favors.Lots of complicated occult figures and mysterious lettering on the floors and walls, ritual cleansing and purging, candles, and other such appropriate mysterious and arcane accoutrement are all employed to this end.Because there are so few ingredients to this movie and it's plot line, the vast majority of the movie is taken up with the depiction of the months and months of rituals and the toll it takes on the 2 characters, sealed in the remote house for the duration. As the months of rituals are difficult and excruciating for the 2 characters, so they are for us.When everything comes to a head at the end of the movie there is at least a little bit of interesting action consisting mostly of what are probably damned beings (apparently wrapped in toilet paper for that coveted damned ""look"") and then, as a pleasant surprise, a rather satisfying appearance from a bona fide angel at the very end. In my opinion, the depiction of the angel is actually quite good and looks to be lifted straight from many historic paintings on the subject. Certainly looked like an angel to me. Very convincingThe movie is well executed, cinematic, atmospheric and has polish. But be aware that it is excruciatingly slow as a natural result of its limited plot elements. It is mostly a depiction of endless occult rituals.If you can be satisfied with that, with a nice little cherry on top at the end, this movie should be satisfying for you. If you need something more to be happening to retain your focus and concentration, then perhaps not so much."
" Really very good.

I liked the rather unexpected special effects, coming as they did, after a smorgasbord of the worst of humankind. The two principals are very good and at times their performances are difficult to watch, but the film treads the true path and leads us to a satisfying outcome. It seems drawn out for most of the early part but it's worth sticking with."
" The Devil really is in the Details
",-0.6597,0.9938,2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"This writer has always felt that the job of a reviewer was not merely to whine and prattle about what does (or does not) happen on screen, but rather to try to introduce the film to the discerning viewer in a way which assists the decision as to whether to see it ... or not? It is projects like Dark Song, however, that make such a simple ambition seem ever so complex.For starters, I will suggest that the best (and most recent) analog I can name is the excellent 2016 Autopsy of Jane Doe. Both films are clearly of the horror genre, both films work their magic by confining two strong personalities (and superb actors) in a confined space, and both films follow the Prime Directive of possibly every horror film ever made, namely ""whatever can go wrong will go wrong."" But that's where the similarities end. Autopsy of Jane Doe is merely a solid and workmanlike exposition of a clever, entertaining, theme. Dark Song is simultaneously the debut of a writer/director with a distinct, clear and uncommon ""voice""; and, at the same time, a horror tale so intricately involved with the minutiae, the moment-to-moment, of true ritual magic (is there any other kind?) that at times you almost, just for a split second, wonder if you are watching a reality show instead of a fictional drama? No small feat, that. Especially from a country that can lay legitimate claim to having produced one of the only genuine, verified, ritual occultists in western history (Aleister Crowley). To watch a film like this aware that there are individuals who literally dedicate their lives to such practices takes the viewer to new levels of awareness ... and terror.The end result is something about as distant from the dozens of currently popular ""found footage"" films ... as the earth is from the moon.Plainly put, to appreciate this film, to drink in and savour every nuance, the viewer himself (or herself) must be willing to commit to the movie to the same extent that the central characters commit to the core ritual.That is to say, lock yourself in, don't leave your seat, and, whatever happens, do not break the circle of salt.If you do all that, you may not get to meet an ""angel"" willing to grant your special boon, but you will get a film experience you will likely never forget."

But I got to tell you, if there are people who are out there practicing this stuff, Be very careful of the powers you dabble with in rituals you perform. You will wind up getting more than what you bargain for, I truly believe spirits are real. I mean this film was straight and to the point about this mother and this occultist performing a really elaborate ritual to summon and angel for what the both wanted. Long story short, things go wrong, one person ends up dead and the one person ends up crossing the protective circle around the house and then all hell breaks loose so to speak. It didn't take much for this film to be good, other than the story and the two characters which all of it was just spot on. The story, the music, the scenes, all just fantastic. Anyone into good story telling will simply enjoy this one a whole lot. And the ending was one the best I've seen in a very long time with films that deal with ritual performing.

While it is always good to be skeptical about such hype or buzz, especially when it is coming out of the film's own PR machine, in this case it just so happens to be true. This film is bound to make it on to many best-of lists for the year.What makes the film brilliant is its two main characters, who we (the audience) are never quite sure about. We have a woman with ambiguous motives and purposes, and this uncertainty only adds to our curiosity and the film's suspense. Even when we find out why she is involving herself in the occult, we are only given half-truths, and more layers are left to be unpeeled.In contrast, we have a dubious leader for this cross-dimensional experiment. C. S. Lewis famously said that Jesus was either the lord, a liar, or a lunatic. While this man is no savior, the same three categories could apply to him. For much of the film we do not know if he is a lord (authentic), a liar (charlatan trying to get money from a mark) or a lunatic (someone who thinks they have powers but clearly does not). This uncertainty is what drives us to keep watching, to see if he can deliver on his promises... and how, along the way, we see how shady he just might be.The dark, ominous score is perfect, and for a film with a modest budget we still get some creepy effects (such as a dead dog). The creators made a film the way a film ought to be made: within the boundaries allotted without over-reaching or stretching yourself too thin.Most of all, the praise should go to the excellent writing, which not only provides the two great characters, but really captures the occult. Not that I claim any real knowledge of black magic or the dark arts, but everything here is done so well, so convincingly that it seems like it could be real. And that is about the highest praise a script or fantastic film can receive."
" An unapologetic occultist horror movie.
",-0.5719,-0.0,2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"Woah. This movie is about the occult and it doesn't beat around any bush. We are starting crazy with eight month long occultist rituals from the get-go. The plot, story and characters are all intriguing and well- designed. However, we have a (maybe) $100,000 budget when $3 million would have made an excellent movie. The director gets everything there is to get from his budget, but the script deserved more. Give Spielberg his very needed return to horror with this script and he makes an instant classic. As it is, very creepy with grotesquely good music."
