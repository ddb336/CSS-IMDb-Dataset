" Stuck in the '70s.
",-0.25,-0.1432,2021-02-16 00:00:00,3,"Gunday review:Rebels/ outlaws made for some classic films in the 70s - Deewaar, Sholay, Kaala Patthar, Laawaris to name a few. These movies worked primarily due to the brooding intensity and swag of Mr. Amitabh Bachchan plus his cracking on-screen camaraderie with co-stars like Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna etc.Gunday has its plot and intent right. Its a classic 70s set up. But then.. neither is Ranveer Singh an Amitabh nor is Arjun Kapoor a Dharmendra or Vinod to pull off this kinda no brainer actioner. Priyanka Chopra,in various state of undress, has little scope to perform in her half baked role. Finally, Gunday doesn't even pass muster as an ode to 70s Bollywood. Skip it.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."

" FULL OF WRONGS
",0.0,-0.807,2020-09-26 00:00:00,1,"A period film that does not feel period. A razor-blade thin plot with some overacted performances. If city's biggest criminals act this childish, police will die laughing. They are ruling Kolkata, and none of their men came to rescue them. Pathetic !"

",0.0,0.7964,2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"I have read some other reviews , I don't know much about India Bangla. History ,
Honestly it's strory about two men from their orphan childhood to their becoming of coal mafia , story is also emotionally and quite edge on the seat.
Ending theme of the movie is just great that you would remember the movie from it."

" India teaches young kid fabricated 71 Liberation war history.
",-0.5994,-0.7079,2020-03-08 00:00:00,1,"India teaches young kid fabricated 71 Liberation war history. Through Bollywood. How shame! Pakistan was our common enemy but to claim our victory as your own, just because you helped with arms and refugees, is a plain hypocrisy. New generation of India and Pakistan have to know the true history of 1971. Do not listen to your government and media, who produces and promotes lies like Gunday. Educate yourself by reading. Tomorrow's world is ours. Bygones the age of darkness. Gunday is not a film or any sort of art. It is a proof of how  attitude Indian Govt. has over it's neighbors. This has to be changed. This movie like garbage deserves no star and so I don't understand how it got 2 points something. Priyanka, Ranaveer have come a long way and they should take an equal part of the blame. How do they don't know about '71?! Just because they are movie star, they do not have to pretend they are not supposed to check historic accuracy of their movie plot. Specially, Priyanka, as an international superstar, should know better than me. How about Bangladesh make a movie about 1947 with derogatory perspective on Indian value. Oh yeah! There will be war. I know. Respect begets respect. New generation India should stand up. Start learning history and be part of anti racist movement. What happened in Delhi recently is a reflection of poor education system that shoves grades and not teach ethics and history. Wake up India. -one fellow neighbor."
" Nothing to say

Gave these stars for Ranveer Singh's style and for some good songs."
" Poor filming
",-0.4767,0.802,2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"If someone does not know how to make a good movie then in that case no one can save that movie even it has actors like Irrfan,pc and Ranveer Singh.
Over the top element used in almost every part of the movie."
" Objective, unbiased, western review!
",-0.1007,0.9819,2019-11-01 00:00:00,6,"""Gunday"" is Bollywood movie through and through. Overacting, scenes without a whole lot of sense, Chuck Norris style of action, songs, dancing, love triangle and drama. It's all here. At the same time you can't believe someone is willing to use so much money making such a naive movie, but at he same time you can't help but to realize you are for some reason enjoying your time. I couldn't care less about political side of the movie, though I understand why it made people angry. Still, it isn't such a bad movie to watch for fun. Bring a friend and laugh and enjoy with this Bollywood bromance! :D ;) 6/10!"
" Worst-ever
",0.0,-0.9302,2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Waste of time! Too much bad qualit. Poor acting. Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you."
" Amazing story,well acted movie. Downvoted by Bangla people not understanding CREATIVE liberties.
",-0.2145,0.9963,2019-09-25 00:00:00,9,"I hope people with much more EMOTIONAL: INTELLECT and Artistic eye can try and appreciate this gem of a movie- directed by Ali Abbas Zafar who after this made SUltan and Tiger Zinda Hai- two Blockbuster movies.
The movie stars Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor as two boys trying to scrap a living through the harsh realities of their childhood. The whole war situation ( which got this movie downvoted) takes about 3 minutes at the beginning.. to explain why these kids were orphans.
I have absolutely loved the bromance shared by Ranveer and Arjun. Priyanka Chopra brings her sass to add to the love triangle 'pizzaz'. The story is basiucally about two boys trying to make a name for themselves and fighting for the same girl. But the lines are delivered with such humour and there are so many scenes that will leave you laughing at the silliness of it all, so that the dramatic portions won;t have time to overwhelm you.. well until towards the end.
The music is super catchy ! I have learned some of the songs although I do n ot speak Hindi or any related language.. I loved them ! The camera work, the costumes and set designs are also of great quality.. and somehow reminiscent - to my eye- of SHOLAY .. another great Indian movie with Amithab B.
All in all this movie was a throughly enjoyable ride.
Watch for Ranveer Singh's tour der force when he was only 2-3 movies old.. the great chemistry he shares with both Arjun and Priyanka and the fight and dance scenes that are so Bollywood!.
Hope you have as much fun with this drama rom-com as I've had!"
" Wrong information
",-0.4767,-0.705,2019-07-27 00:00:00,1,"They exhibit wrong information in their movie, they said '71 war was betweens India and Pakistan but it's totally wrong.
It was between India nd Bangla join force vs Pakistan army."

" Worst movie ever made by India
",-0.6249,-0.9118,2018-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Bad screen play, bad story writing, bad acting, bad ending..."
" History of Bangladesh Independence War is ignored
",-0.7351,-0.9661,2018-02-17 00:00:00,1,In this movie director told that it was between India an Pakistan war n 1971. But it was totally false. It was between East Paskistan and West Pakistan. East Pakistan Become Bangladesh after war. India Joined the war for only 15 days before the Victory Day. It was not Indo-Pak war in any ways.
" A very very moving movie
",0.0,-0.7877,2017-07-28 00:00:00,10,"At first I never understood why the movie was getting rated down so badly. Looking at the IMDb reviews I though i wouldn't want to see the movie. But the songs of this movie has always been one of my favorites - kunto maula, gunday title track. ITs when I started reading the reviews I really understand where these low ratings are coming from. Its rated 1 start by mostly those Bangladeshis who do not agree with the story of the movie. I understand they may not relate to the story but then if one was to rate the movie on its story I would rate it 8/10 and acting will fetch 7.5/10 but the climax of the movie is what really made me cry. Through out the movie I was slowly drawn into the close bonds the two lead characters share on the screen. It makes you cry at the end. Then climax is full 'paisa vasool' worth the money. It have seen the climax at least 10 - 15 times. Its when the movie ends you make sense out of the story, background narration by the two gundays makes it worth a worth second time. Don't go by the 1/10 rating these Bangladeshis have given because it shows how much Bangladeshis would like to be a part of this nation called Indian out of which they were born. 1 start rating is not due to bad story or bad acting but because it deeply hurts a Bangladeshis ego / sentiments. I have always considered Bangladeshis as brothers but then after all during 1947 they (as a part of Pakistan) had decided to part from India on the basis of religion - such stupids are difficult to find anywhere in the world."
" A bromance that runs high on emotions!!! Ranveer & Arjun fans cannot miss it!
",0.3843,0.9724,2017-04-08 00:00:00,9,"This film dishes up emotions like drugs, and if anyone is addicted to such stuff he's sure to enjoy this flick. It has the unbreakable friendship bond, enmity, betrayal, courage, emotions and above all four excellent performances in Ranveer, Arjun, Irrfan and Priyanka. I'm a big time anti-Arjun, but I think even he did really well here in this film.Of course, the story and the plot may not be something entirely new or extraordinary, but the films doesn't go dull even for a moment. However, let's touch upon the controversial aspect of this film:1. It shows of India mistreating Bangladeshi refugees. It offended some Indians I read.Then we move onto the two biggest controversial parts of it, the third being the one that caused protests!2. It shows that, for no apparent reasons, Bangladeshis consider themselves Indians. This is best seen in the scene where they kill that man on the train and shout out at him ""How are they to be blamed for having been born on the other side of the border? How does it make you any better Indian for having born on this side?"" Absolutely cringe-worthy patriotism propaganda!3. In its very introductory few minutes, Bangladesh's independence is portrayed as a by-product of an Indo-Pak war. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason why this film ends up as the worst- rated film on IMDb thanks to the mass voting by the Bangladeshis - a campaign that was kind of officially led by some organisation of theirs on social media; and I totally understand their sentiment. Maybe I would've understood their objection to it better had I myself been a Bangladeshi, because they take great pride in their struggle for liberation and the number of people who lost lives for them.But I would think beyond those introductory notes read by Irrfan the first few minutes and rate it as a film based on its own story, film-making and performances. As a fan of Ranveer, I fully enjoyed this emotion-fest, complemented by three wonderful songs, especially that soulful Qawwaali. I can watch it any day and enjoy it all over again!"
